https://openalex.org/W2017987256,"High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module."
https://openalex.org/W2114232003,"We report heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding either type I or type II transforming growth factor beta receptor in ten families with a newly described human phenotype that includes widespread perturbations in cardiovascular, craniofacial, neurocognitive and skeletal development. Despite evidence that receptors derived from selected mutated alleles cannot support TGFbeta signal propagation, cells derived from individuals heterozygous with respect to these mutations did not show altered kinetics of the acute phase response to administered ligand. Furthermore, tissues derived from affected individuals showed increased expression of both collagen and connective tissue growth factor, as well as nuclear enrichment of phosphorylated Smad2, indicative of increased TGFbeta signaling. These data definitively implicate perturbation of TGFbeta signaling in many common human phenotypes, including craniosynostosis, cleft palate, arterial aneurysms, congenital heart disease and mental retardation, and suggest that comprehensive mechanistic insight will require consideration of both primary and compensatory events."
https://openalex.org/W1972857233,"U-Pb zircon dates from volcanic ash beds within the Doushantuo Formation (China) indicate that its deposition occurred between 635 and 551 million years ago. The base records termination of the global-scale Marinoan glaciation and is coeval with similar dated rocks from Namibia, indicating synchronous deglaciation. Carbon isotopic and sequence-stratigraphic data imply that the spectacular animal fossils of the Doushantuo Formation are for the most part younger than 580 million years old. The uppermost Doushantuo Formation contains a pronounced negative carbonate carbon isotopic excursion, which we interpret as a global event at circa 551 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2171776741,"We identified axonal defects in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that preceded known disease-related pathology by more than a year; we observed similar axonal defects in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease in humans. Axonal defects consisted of swellings that accumulated abnormal amounts of microtubule-associated and molecular motor proteins, organelles, and vesicles. Impairing axonal transport by reducing the dosage of a kinesin molecular motor protein enhanced the frequency of axonal defects and increased amyloid-β peptide levels and amyloid deposition. Reductions in microtubule-dependent transport may stimulate proteolytic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein, resulting in the development of senile plaques and Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2029806711,"Future surveys for transiting extrasolar planets are expected to detect hundreds of jovian-mass planets and tens of terrestrial-mass planets. For many of these newly discovered planets, the intervals between successive transits will be measured with an accuracy of 0.1 to 100 minutes. We show that these timing measurements will allow for the detection of additional planets in the system (not necessarily transiting) by their gravitational interaction with the transiting planet. The transit-time variations depend on the mass of the additional planet, and in some cases terrestrial-mass planets will produce a measurable effect. In systems where two planets are seen to transit, the density of both planets can be determined without radial-velocity observations."
https://openalex.org/W2004844038,"ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins constitute a large family of membrane proteins that actively transport a broad range of substrates. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among ABC proteins in that its transmembrane domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated NBDs of prokaryotic ABC proteins dimerize upon binding ATP, and hydrolysis of the ATP causes dimer dissociation. Here, using single-channel recording methods on intact CFTR molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the channel gates, and relate these occurrences to ATP-mediated events in the NBDs. We find that energetic coupling between two CFTR residues, expected to lie on opposite sides of its predicted NBD1-NBD2 dimer interface, changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the channels open. The results directly link ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, that is probably common to all members of the ABC protein superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2091630436,"From the comparison of interstellar gas tracers in the solar neighborhood (HI and CO lines from the atomic and molecular gas, dust thermal emission, and g rays from cosmic-ray interactions with gas), we unveil vast clouds of cold dust and dark gas, invisible in HI and CO but detected in γ rays. They surround all the nearby CO clouds and bridge the dense cores to broader atomic clouds, thus providing a key link in the evolution of interstellar clouds. The relation between the masses in the molecular, dark, and atomic phases in the local clouds implies a dark gas mass in the Milky Way comparable to the molecular one."

https://openalex.org/W2126482672,"The genomic diversity and relative importance of distinct genotypes within natural bacterial populations have remained largely unknown. Here, we analyze the diversity and annual dynamics of a group of coastal bacterioplankton (greater than 99% 16 S ribosomal RNA identity to Vibrio splendidus ). We show that this group consists of at least a thousand distinct genotypes, each occurring at extremely low environmental concentrations (on average less than one cell per milliliter). Overall, the genomes show extensive allelic diversity and size variation. Individual genotypes rarely recurred in samples, and allelic distribution did not show spatial or temporal substructure. Ecological considerations suggest that much genotypic and possibly phenotypic variation within natural populations should be considered neutral."
https://openalex.org/W2001944628,"Animals have evolved mechanisms to maintain circulating nutrient levels when energy demands exceed feeding opportunities. Mammals store most of their energy as triacylglycerol in the perilipin-coated lipid droplets of adipocytes. How newly synthesized triacylglycerol is delivered to perilipin-coated lipid droplets is poorly understood. Perilipin is a member of the evolutionarily related family of PAT proteins (Perilipin, Adipophilin, TIP47), which is defined by sequence similarity and association with lipid droplets. We previously showed that S3-12, which is also a member of this family, associates with a separate pool of lipid droplets that emerge when triacylglycerol storage is driven by adding oleate to the culture medium of adipocytes. Our current data extend these findings to demonstrate that nascent lipid droplets emerge with a coat composed of S3-12, TIP47, and adipophilin. After 100 min of oleate treatment, the nascent lipid droplets are more heterogeneous: S3-12 and TIP47 coat smaller, peripheral droplets and adipophilin coats a more medial population of droplets. Fractionation of untreated and oleate-treated adipocytes shows oleate-dependent redistribution of TIP47 and adipophilin from cytosolic fractions to the lipid droplet fraction. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide does not block the oleate-induced formation of the nascent lipid droplets, nor does it prevent TAG accumulation. We suggest that the non-lipid droplet pools of S3-12, adipophilin, and TIP47 constitute a ready reservoir of coat proteins to permit rapid packaging of newly synthesized triacylglycerol and to maximize energy storage during nutrient excess.

The ability to store energy as triacylglycerol (TAG) 1The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DGAT, acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; OGI, oleate, glucose, and insulin; PAT, Perilipin ADRP and TIP47; TIP47, tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast; TEM, transmission electron microscopy.1The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DGAT, acyl coenzyme A:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; OGI, oleate, glucose, and insulin; PAT, Perilipin ADRP and TIP47; TIP47, tail-interacting protein of 47 kDa; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast; TEM, transmission electron microscopy. and later mobilize energy from this reservoir as free fatty acids and glycerol allows animals to survive prolonged periods of fasting. Higher animals store TAG in specialized cells, adipocytes, which are able to efficiently synthesize TAG from fatty acid and glucose and package TAG into large storage droplets (10-100-μm diameter). Other cell types have a more limited capacity to store TAG and rarely accumulate large lipid droplets. The robust ability of the adipocyte to store TAG is not without limit. It has been hypothesized that, when the visceral adipose tissue depot fills up, excess lipid “overflows” into other tissues that are less able than adipocytes to package and store TAG. Fatty acids not esterified to glycerol are toxic even at low concentrations (1Schaffer J.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In fact, failure to efficiently sequester lipid into the lipid storage droplets of adipocytes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, nonalchoholic fatty liver disease, β-cell failure, and cardiomyopathy (2Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Little is known of mechanisms by which cells, and adipocytes in particular, package newly synthesized TAG into storage droplets (3Murphy D.J. Vance J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 4Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The structure of intracellular lipid droplets is similar to that of lipoproteins, a neutral lipid core is surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer and a protein coat. This structural organization is conserved among animals, plants, and yeast. A likely candidate location for the initiation of lipid droplet biogenesis would be the site of the final step in TAG synthesis. However, the sites of neutral lipid synthesis are unclear. TAG is synthesized from diacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA substrates in a reaction catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). At least 2 proteins (DGAT1 and DGAT2) with DGAT activity have been reported. Evidence has been presented that DGAT1 and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), the enzyme responsible for steryl ester synthesis, resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Sakashita N. Miyazaki A. Takeya M. Horiuchi S. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Takahashi K. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 227-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Quittnat F. Nishikawa Y. Stedman T.T. Voelker D.R. Choi J.Y. Zahn M.M. Murphy R.C. Barkley R.M. Pypaert M. Joiner K.A. Coppens I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular location of DGAT2 has not been established. These enzymes may not be the only sources of intracellular neutral lipids. Also, the origin of the phospholipid monolayer is not known. Finally, although a number of lipid droplet surface proteins have been reported, how proteins target to and associate with the lipid droplet is not understood. Based upon biochemical and morphological data primarily in yeast and plants, a prevailing model of lipid droplet formation has emerged. According to this model, neutral lipid is synthesized within the leaflets of the ER membrane bilayer. As neutral lipid accumulates and coalesces within the bilayer, the bilayer distends locally into a “lens” of neutral lipid surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. Eventually, the lens buds off into the cytosol as a nascent lipid droplet or may remain associated with the ER. This model allows for several mechanisms by which lipid droplet coat proteins might associate with the droplet surface (4Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). First, coat proteins may reside on the ER membrane and partition with the nascent droplet during lens formation and droplet budding. Second, coat proteins, either as soluble proteins or vesicle-associated proteins may target to the surface of droplets by specific peptide sequences or by hydrophobic interactions. Third, coat proteins may exist as preformed complexes into which newly synthesized neutral lipid is transferred. In mammals the Perilipin-Adipophilin-TIP47 (PAT) family of proteins (7Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) has been shown to coat lipid droplets. This protein family is defined by lipid droplet binding and sequence similarity. Perilipin and adipophilin (also known as adipocyte differentiation-related protein, ADRP) have been reported to bind to lipid droplets independent of metabolic state; whereas, TIP47 only binds lipid under specific metabolic conditions (8Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). S3-12 shares sequence similarity with TIP47 and adipophilin and, like TIP47, only coats lipid droplets under certain metabolic states (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because these protein sequences are similar to perilipin and can be found at the interface of the lipid droplet with the cytosol, we hypothesize that they organize the packaging and trafficking of intracellular neutral lipid. Under basal conditions, 3T3-L1 adipocytes have a single population of lipid droplets that are coated by perilipin and tend to cluster around the nucleus, but S3-12 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern. We have previously shown that when TAG synthesis is driven by incubating adipocytes in medium supplemented with albumin-bound oleate, a pool of small S3-12-coated lipid droplets emerges at the adipocyte periphery (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). During the first hour of accelerated TAG synthesis, the S3-12-coated lipid droplets remain separate from the perinuclear, perilipin-coated droplets. However, after longer treatment times, the S3-12-coated lipid droplets become larger and are found closer to the nucleus. Longer treatment times also result in a ring of droplets positioned between the peripheral S3-12-coated droplets and perinuclear perilipin-coated lipid droplets that are coated with both proteins. Finally, when adipocytes are removed from the conditions that drive TAG synthesis, S3-12 returns to its more diffuse distribution, leaving only perilipin-coated lipid droplets (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, we have observed the dynamic process of lipid droplet formation in live adipocytes by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, investigated the ultrastructural features of nascent lipid droplets by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and determined the integrated behavior of PAT family proteins during accelerated TAG synthesis by fluorescence microscopy. These studies reveal a spatially and temporally ordered process of lipid droplet formation and maturation that involves coordinated redistribution of multiple PAT proteins. We further report that preexisting pools of these PAT proteins exist prior to substrate loading of adipocytes. These protein pools likely contribute to the capacity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to accommodate rapid TAG synthesis. Reagents—Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were obtained from Sigma. Essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Intergen Co. (catalog no: 3320; Purchase, NY). Fatty Acids—Oleate was solubilized with sodium hydroxide and bound to BSA at a ratio of 5.5 molecules oleate per molecule BSA. BODIPY® FL C12 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, catalog no: D3822) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and bound to BSA at a ratio of 1.4 molecules BODIPY® FL C12 per molecule BSA. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured and differentiated as described previously (10Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Day 0 of differentiation was defined as the day by which the 3T3-L1 cells had been confluent for 2 days and were first exposed to the adipogenic mixture that contained 174 nm insulin, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. HeLa cells and HIB-1B preadipocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Antibodies—Antibodies to TIP47 were raised in rabbits by Proteintech (Chicago, IL) against the peptide MSSNGTDAPAEAQAAMEEPVC conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Antibodies were then affinity purified against this peptide using an antibody purification kit (Pierce, cat. no: 44895) following the manufacturer's protocol.

Rabbit anti-caveolin-1 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA, cat. no. C13630). Isolation of Mouse TIP47 cDNA—The primer set below was used to amplify the full-length coding sequence of mouse TIP47 from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library: forward primer, GAAGATCTACCATGTCTAGCAATGGTACAGATGCG; reverse primer, CTCTTTTGGGGACTTCCCTTCATCCGCCGGCGCTTAAGGT. The PCR product was TA-cloned into pCR TOPO2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The open reading frame that encoded mouse TIP47 was identical to cDNA NM_025836 (14Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Grouse L.H.

For mammalian expression, this mouse TIP47 coding sequence was isolated as an EcoRI fragment from pCR TOPO2.1-mouse TIP47 and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS (15Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar), in which expression of the gene of interest is driven by a synthetic promoter based on the chicken β-actin promoter. Oleate, Glucose, and Insulin (OGI) Treatment—To promote accelerated TAG synthesis, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown in complete medium as described (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and then incubated in PBS that contained oleate bound to albumin (see figure legend for concentration), 25 mm glucose, 10 nm insulin, and 2% BSA. Live Cell Imaging—Day 6 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized and replated at 30% their original density into a glass bottom dish. The following day, TAG synthesis was induced by OGI treatment as described above. DIC images were captured every 20 s with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser scanning microscope. Electron Microscopy—Day 6 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized and replated at their original density in 35-mm dishes. After 18 h, the adipocytes were either OGI-treated or left untreated for 100 min. Cells were then fixed and prepared for transmission electron microscopy analysis essentially as described (16Shyng S.L. Heuser J.E. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HeLa Cell Transfections—HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCAGGS-mTIP47 plasmid DNA and 7 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per 35-mm dish using the manufacturer's protocol. Generating Fluorescent-labeled HeLa Cell Lipid Droplets—HeLa cells on coverslips were incubated 18 h with 6 μm fluorescent fatty acid BODIPY® FL C12 and 225 μm albumin-bound oleate. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed well with PBS and solubilized with HNETC lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% cholate, and Complete protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science; cat. no: 1 836 153)). A 21,000 × g × 10 min supernatant was generated. The solubilized proteins were resolved in Bio-Rad XT precast gels and blotted according to the manufacturer's directions. Membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 3% BSA. The membranes were then probed with primary antibody in the blocking buffer at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. The membranes were washed several times in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. The membranes were washed again several times in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and imaged with a FluorChem 8900 imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). For quantitation, relative band signals were calculated using AlphaEase FC software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Day 6 or 7 3T3-L1 adipocytes were trypsinized and replated onto coverslips at one-third their original density. The following day, adipocytes were treated as described in the figure legends. The adipocytes were then fixed, stained with antibody dilutions as noted in the figure legends, and imaged as described previously (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37713-37721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fractionation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—The following procedure was performed as rapidly and as close to 4 °C as possible. Four 100-mm plates of Day 7 3T3-L1 adipocytes were scraped in PBS and centrifuged at 3220 × g for 180 s. The adipocyte pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA). Adipocytes were allowed to swell for 10 min and then were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation (600 psi for 15 min) in a Parr Cell Disruption Bomb, model 4639 (Parr Instruments Company, Moline, IL). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. 1 ml of the supernatant was collected and weighted with 1.5 ml of 65% sucrose (w/w). 2 ml of weighted supernatant were pipetted into a 5-ml centrifuge tube. Then 1.1-ml layers of 30% followed by 10% sucrose (w/w) in lysis buffer were layered on top of the sucrose supernatant. The tube was filled to capacity with lysis buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at increasing forces: 5 min at 2700 × g, 10 min at 10,700 × g, 20 min at 43,000 × g, 30 min at 172,000 × g and then allowed to coast to a stop. The floating fraction was visualized as a white layer at the top of the gradient and was isolated by cutting the tube with a tube slicer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) just below the floating fraction. This fraction was brought to 650 μl with lysis buffer. Then 7 additional 650-μl fractions were collected. Cycloheximide Treatment—Cycloheximide was added from a 100 mg/ml stock dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. TAG Measurements—Gradient fractions were added directly to the colorimetric TAG quantitation reagent (Wako Chemicals USA, Inc., Richmond, VA, cat. no. L-Type TG H). Corn oil dissolved in ethanol was used as a TAG standard. TAG Measurement to Assess TAG Synthesis Rates—Approximately 2% of a Day 5 or Day 6 100-mm plate of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were plated in each well of a 24-well plate. On Day 7, adipocytes were treated as described in the legend of Fig. 7. Then TAG was extracted as described previously (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The lipid phases were dried, and the colorimetric TAG quantification reagent (Thermo Electron Corporation, Melbourne, Australia, cat. no. 2780-400H) was added to the lipid residue. The corn oil standard was added before the extraction and processed with the samples. Protein Extraction from Mouse Adipose Tissue—Protein was extracted from epididymal fat pads of C57BL/6 mice as described (9Wolins N.E. Skinner J.R. Schoenfish M.J. Tzekov A. Bensch K.G. Bickel P.E.

Real-time DIC Microscopy of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes during Active TAG Synthesis—We have previously shown that 3T3-L1 adipocytes rapidly accumulate TAG in oleate-supplemented medium and that during rapid TAG accumulation S3-12 moves from a diffuse distribution onto nascent lipid droplets. These nascent lipid droplets increase in size during continued incubation with oleate. Our previous microscopy showed fixed adipocytes, and thus the dynamic process of lipid droplet biogenesis has not been examined. For example, it is unclear whether these nascent lipid droplets grow by fusion with other nascent droplets or by synthesis of new TAG. Lipid droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes can be identified by DIC microscopy as well-defined, translucent, spherical structures of ∼0.5-10 microns diameter. In order to detect changes in the lipid droplets of adipocytes in real-time, we treated live 3T3-L1 adipocytes with OGI to promote rapid TAG synthesis and captured DIC images at 20-s intervals. Adipocytes were identified by their characteristic round shape and numerous lipid droplets. Under basal culture conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum), lipid droplets were arranged with the smallest droplets at the periphery and the largest droplets in the thick, perinuclear region of the adipocyte. The lipid droplets were usually present in clusters or rows rather than being evenly distributed throughout the cytosol. Over the 102 min of the experiment, the lipid droplets maintained their clustered arrangement with the smallest lipid droplets at the adipocyte periphery and the larger lipid droplets near the nuclei (Fig. 1). The most obvious morphological change in the adipocyte during OGI incubation was a large increase in the size and number of small and medium-sized lipid droplets (<2-μm diameter). Observations at 20-s intervals over 102 min failed to document any clear fusion events between lipid droplets. Smaller, peripheral droplets enlarged and migrated centrally. By 68 min the adipocyte cytoplasm had become filled with lipid droplets and the perinuclear lipid droplets were packed tightly. Because of the large number and rapid movements in three dimensions of the perinuclear lipid droplets, combined with relatively long periods between frames, fusion events may have gone undetected. Nascent and Mature Lipid Droplets Observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy—To assess ultrastructural changes that occur in adipocytes during rapid TAG synthesis, we analyzed OGI and untreated adipocytes by TEM. Both the OGI and untreated adipocytes contained multiple round, electron-lucent voids (>1-micron diameter). In the untreated adipocytes, these voids were usually surrounded by cisternae that appeared as tubules in thin sections. An electron dense capsule was apparent at the periphery of some of the void structures, where breaks occurred during processing (Fig. 2). These electron-lucent voids have been identified previously as lipid droplets surrounded by ER (18Cushman S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 326-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J.

Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In OGI-treated adipocytes, there are many small electron lucent voids (<1-micron diameter) in addition to the large cisternae-blanketed lipid droplets. These voids were not surrounded by any observable capsule and were largely found at the periphery and base of the adipocytes. Like the nascent lipid droplets observed by DIC microscopy, the small electron-lucent voids usually formed rows or clusters. The size, location, time of appearance, and organization of the small electron-lucent structures suggest that they correspond to the OGI-induced nascent lipid droplets originally identified by fluorescence and DIC microscopy. Notably, in OGI-treated adipocytes, we identified no physical association of nascent lipid droplets with ER membranes, and we visualized no “lens” structures associated with ER membranes. A Polyclonal Antibody Specifically Recognizes TIP47 in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—In non-adipocytes, the PAT protein TIP47 has been reported to coat lipid droplets (7Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J.

In order to assess whether TIP47 protein is expressed in adipocytes and whether OGI treatments affect the subcellular distribution of TIP47, we raised an anti-peptide antibody to the N-terminal 20 residues of mouse TIP47. We chose this epitope because it has no significant amino acid conservation with mouse adipophilin as assessed by Clustal (23Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Further, the N terminus of TIP47 is poorly conserved between the mouse and human, which allowed generation of an antibody that recognized mouse TIP47, but not adipophilin or human TIP47. Proteins extracted from untransfected HeLa cells, from HeLa cells expressing mouse TIP47, and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were resolved by PAGE and blotted. As expected, the TIP47 antibody reacts strongly with a single species from HeLa cells transfected with mouse TIP47 (Fig. 3B) and shows little reactivity against proteins in untransfected HeLa cells. The most prominent band detected by our mouse TIP47 antibody is consistent with the predicted molecular weight of TIP47. Faint bands were visualized in all 3 samples, and likely represented nonspecific antibody binding. Further, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, this antibody recognizes a polypeptide that co-migrates with the major immunoreactive species in HeLa cells transfected with mouse TIP47 (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence microscopy using this antibody shows only a faint, diffuse signal in untransfected, lipid-loaded HeLa cells (Fig. 3C, anti-TIP47, cell on right indicated with white arrow). However, in HeLa cells that express mouse TIP47, this antibody strongly labels the surfaces of lipid droplets (Fig. 3C, anti-TIP47, cell on left). These data demonstrate that the TIP47 antibody that we have generated specifically recognizes native mouse TIP47. Furthermore,"

To investigate its role in intestinal tumorigenesis, we created a mouse model of Igf2 LOI by crossing female H19 +/– mice with male Apc +/Min mice. Mice with LOI developed twice as many intestinal tumors as did control littermates. Notably, these mice also showed a shift toward a less differentiated normal intestinal epithelium, reflected by an increase in crypt length and increased staining with progenitor cell markers. A similar shift in differentiation was seen in the normal colonic mucosa of humans with LOI. Thus, altered maturation of nonneoplastic tissue may be one mechanism by which epigenetic changes affect cancer risk."

The bacterium is protected against the response by the O antigen of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on its surface. We show that bacteriophage-encoded glucosylation of Shigella O antigen, the basis of different serotypes, shortens the LPS molecule by around half. This enhances TTSS function without compromising the protective properties of the LPS. Thus, LPS glucosylation promotes bacterial invasion and evasion of innate immunity, which may have contributed to the emergence of serotype diversity in Shigella ."
https://openalex.org/W1980267834,"It has been established that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or superoxide anion is involved in bone loss-related diseases by stimulating osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption and that receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is a critical osteoclastogenic factor expressed on stromal/osteoblastic cells. However, the roles of ROS in RANKL expression and signaling mechanisms through which ROS regulates RANKL genes are not known. Here we report that increased intracellular ROS levels by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or xanthine/xanthine oxidase-generated superoxide anion stimulated RANKL mRNA and protein expression in human osteoblast-like MG63 cell line and primary mouse bone marrow stromal cells and calvarial osteoblasts. Further analysis revealed that ROS promoted phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/ATF2 and its binding to CRE-domain in the murine RANKL promoter region. Moreover, the results of protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT5720 and CREB1 RNA interference transfection clearly showed that PKA-CREB signaling pathway was necessary for ROS stimulation of RANKL in mouse osteoblasts. In human MG63 cells, however, we found that ROS promoted heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) binding to heat shock element in human RANKL promoter region and that HSF2, but not PKA, was required for ROS up-regulation of RANKL as revealed by KT5720 and HSF2 RNA interference transfection. We also found that ROS stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and that PD98059, the inhibitor for ERKs suppressed ROS-induced RANKL expression either in mouse osteoblasts or in MG63 cells. These results demonstrate that ROS stimulates RANKL expression via ERKs and PKA-CREB pathway in mouse osteoblasts and via ERKs and HSF2 in human MG63 cells."

We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of 14-3-3σ bound to an optimal phosphopeptide ligand at 2.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals the presence of stabilizing ring-ring and salt bridge interactions unique to the 14-3-3σ homodimer structure and potentially destabilizing electrostatic interactions between subunits in 14-3-3σ-containing heterodimers, rationalizing preferential homodimerization of 14-3-3σ in vivo. The interaction of the phosphopeptide with 14-3-3 reveals a conserved mechanism for phospho-dependent ligand binding, implying that the phosphopeptide binding cleft is not the critical determinant of the unique biological properties of 14-3-3σ.

One well established function of 14-3-3 in negatively regulating M-phase entry involves functional sequestration of the mitotic promoting phosphatase Cdc25C (17Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z.

What is structural basis for the distinct function of σ and its ligand discrimination? Why are 14-3-3σ effects not diluted out through heterodimerization with other 14-3-3 isotypes? This study was designed to investigate structural differences between 14-3-3σ and other 14-3-3 family members in an attempt to provide a molecular rationalization for some of these aspects of σ-specific function.

The HA-tagged 14-3-3σ M202I, D204E, H206D triple mutant was generated using site-directed PCR mutagenesis with HA-14-3-3σ pCDNA3.1 as a template. The following two primer sets were used: AGGGAGACCCAAGCTTACCAT (forward-1) and GAGGGTGTCCAGTTCAGCAATGGCCTC (reverse-1) and GAGGCCATTGCTGAACTGGACACCCTC (forward-2) and TGATTAGGGTGATGGTTCACG (reverse-2) to create a PCR product that was ligated into the HindIII/XhoI sites in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector using Roche's Rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). A vector for low level mammalian expression of 2×FLAG-tagged 14-3-3σ was generated by first inserting a Kozak sequence and 2×FLAG epitope into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCDNA3.1+ using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCCGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTGTAATCCATGGTGGCG-3′. 14-3-3σ was then PCR amplified with EcoRI/XhoI compatible ends and subcloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the pCDNA3.1 + 2×FLAG vector. The final 2×FLAG-14-3-3σ cassette was then subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRV sites of the tetracycline-inducible vector pTRE (BD Biosciences). Low level expression of 2×FLAG-14-3-3σ was obtained by culturing transfected cells in media lacking tetracycline. pGEX vectors for bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase-tagged 14-3-3σ, -β, -γ, -ϵ, and -ζ have been described previously (12Yaffe M.B.

A bacterial expression vector for production of recombinant untagged 14-3-3σ for use in crystallization studies was generated by PCR amplifying 14-3-3σ from pGEX-14-3-3σ with NcoI/HindIII compatible ends and subcloning the PCR product into the NcoI/HindIII sites of pKK233-2. All vector constructs were transformed into DH5α Eschericia coli. Following colony selection, plasmid DNA was prepared (Qiagen) and the sequence verified by dideoxy sequencing. Bacterial expression of recombinant proteins was performed by transforming BL21(DE3) E. coli with the appropriate plasmids, followed by growth in LB medium containing ampicillin. Cultures were induced at an A600 of 0.6–0.8 by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm followed by growth for 4 h at 37 °C prior to cell harvesting by centrifugation. Tissue Culture and Mammalian Cell Transfections—U20S cells (passage 12, ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/HEPES medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin in 10-cm2 culture dishes. The HA- and 2×FLAG-tagged 14-3-3 constructs (4 μg) were transfected into ∼50% confluent U2OS cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as recommended by the manufacturer. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 Gy of ionizing radiation 24 h following transfection. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared by scraping U2OS cells into modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 nm microcystin LR, 5 nm okadaic acid, 2 μm cantharidin, 0.00073% p-bromotetramisole, 10 μm E64, and 1 mm AEBSF) and pushed through a syringe equipped with a 30-gauge needle three times. Lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants recovered. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 1 mg of whole cell lysates and 4 μg of the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following binding to protein-A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at 4 °C using 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by incubation for 1–2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for the HA epitope (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) or 14-3-3σ (clone CS-112 (29Brunet A. Kanai F. Stehn J. Xu J. Sarbassova D. Frangioni J.V. Dalal S.N. DeCaprio J.A. Greenberg M.E. Yaffe M.B. J.

Primary antibodies were used at dilutions between 1:1000 and 1:2500. Blots were washed three times for 15 min each with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:2500–1:5000 dilution for 60 min at room temperature. Following washing, immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the blots exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For two-dimensional electrophoresis, immunoprecipitations from whole cell extracts were suspended in 100 μl of focusing buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 15 mg/ml DTT, 2% ampholytes) cup-loaded onto prerehydrated 7-cm IPG strips (pH 4–7, all strips from the same lot), and subjected to isoelectric focusing for 15 min at 100 V, 15 min at 200 V, 30 min at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and 6 h at 3500 V using an IPGphor isoelectric focusing system device (Amersham Biosciences). Strips were washed in re-equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS) in the presence of 20 mg/ml dithiothreitol for 10 min and then in the presence of 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide for 10 min to irreversibly modify all cysteine residues. The strips were then loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoresed at 120 V for 1 h. Gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and used for Western blot analyses using the appropriate antibodies in conjunction with enhanced chemiluminescence detection. 14-3-3σ Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Solution—Pellets of bacteria expressing untagged 14-3-3σ corresponding to 3 liters of culture were suspended in 200 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm AEBSF) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, diluted to 100 mm NaCl with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT), and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer QA (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT). The column was washed extensively in the same buffer and the protein then eluted with a 100–500 mm NaCl gradient. Fractions containing 14-3-3σ, determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and dialyzed against gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation to ∼2 ml for loading onto a Superdex-75 gel filtration column. Appropriate fractions from the gel filtration column were dialyzed into buffer HA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with buffer HA. Protein was eluted with a linear gradient from buffer HA to buffer HB (250 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT). Purified 14-3-3σ (∼8 mg) was dialyzed into 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration, divided into 250-μg aliquots, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. An optimal mode-1 phosphopeptide was synthesized using N-α-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids with standard BOP/HOBt coupling chemistry and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Protein-peptide complexes were prepared at 5 mg/ml protein by combining freshly thawed protein stock with a 2-fold molar excess of phosphopeptide and dilution with water. Crystals were grown at 18 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops over 1–2 weeks. 1–2 μl of complex was mixed with an equal volume of well solutions containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 6–10% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100–150 mm NaF, and 40 mm CaCl2. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen after a brief soak in synthetic mother liquor containing 15% glycerol, which was made by adding a 50% solution of glycerol in well solution directly to the hanging drop. Crystals were screened on a Rigaku rotating anode source with Yale mirror optics and a R-AXIS IV detector. A 2.4 Å resolution data set was collected at 100 K using the NE-CAT 8BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Chicago, IL). The space group of the crystals was C222l, with a single 14-3-3 dimer and its two bound peptides in the asymmetric unit. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (30Otwinowski Z. Sawyers L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar), and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using AmoRe (31CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. Sect. D Biol.

Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as 1YWT. A comparison of the sequence of 14-3-3σ with that of other human 14-3-3 isotypes, as well as with those in the evolutionarily distant budding and fission yeast (Fig. 1A), reveals many regions of considerable sequence conservation. Despite this strong global sequence preservation, there are a number of short regions in 14-3-3σ that differ in general from those in other 14-3-3 proteins. A particularly striking example is a unique 3 amino acid substitution in the αH-αI linker. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) reveals that σ is the most divergent of all 14-3-3 proteins, consistent with its apparently unique function in vivo. All other 14-3-3 proteins can be clustered into three major clades, one containing 14-3-3ϵ together with the yeast isoforms, a second clade containing the η and γ isoforms, and a third clade containing the τ, β, and ζ isoforms. The structure of 14-3-3σ gene on chromosome 1, together with its complete lack of introns (a feature unique to σ), support a hypothesis that 14-3-3σ may represent a functional retrotransposed gene. Given the propensity of 14-3-3 proteins to form both homodimers and mixed heterodimers with other 14-3-3 isotypes (10Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Chaudhri M. Scarabel M. Aitken A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), what accounts for the functional specificity of 14-3-3σ revealed by mammalian genetic experiments (16Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar)? To address this question, the extent of 14-3-3σ homo- versus heterodimerization was investigated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous 14-3-3σ in U2OS cells and the results compared with those obtained by immunoprecipitating 14-3-3β. Samples were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting to maximize resolution between individual isotypes. As shown in Fig. 2A, 14-3-3β was easily detectable in anti-β immunoprecipitates (panel a); however, no 14-3-3σ was pulled down in these samples (panel b). In contrast, a monoclonal antibody against 14-3-3σ strongly immunoprecipitated 14-3-3σ (panel e) but failed to immunoprecipitate any 14-3-3β (panel d). These data suggest that endogenous 14-3-3σ and β do not form mixed heterodimers. When the anti-β immunoprecipitates were blotted with an antibody that recognizes all of the 14-3-3 isotypes, at least 10 distinct spots were observed (panel c), consistent with extensive heterodimerization between β and other 14-3-3 isotypes. In contrast, when the anti-σ immunoprecipitates were probed with this same antibody (panel f), there were very few additional spots seen. These data indicate that 14-3-3σ preferentially forms homodimers within cells. The specificity of the antibodies used in Fig. 2A is shown in Fig. 2B. To verify that the lack of 14-3-3σ heterodimerization we observed was not an artifact of dimer disruption by the anti-σ antibody, we transfected cells with a 2×FLAG-tagged 14-3-3σ construct and looked at its co-association with endogenous σ and β in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 2C, endogenous 14-3-3σ dimerized with the 2×FLAG-tagged σ, while endogenous 14-3-3β did not. These findings confirm the conclusion, drawn from our two-dimensional gel results, that 14-3-3σ preferentially forms homodimers. To understand the basis of preferential homodimerizaton, and to shed light on mechanisms of functional specificity for 14-3-3σ, we solved the x-ray crystal structure of 14-3-3σ bound to the mode-1 phosphopeptide MARSHpSYPAKKK at 2.4 Å resolution (Table I). As shown in Fig. 3A, the general shape of 14-3-3σ is essentially identical to that of 14-3-3τ and -ζ (34Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), consisting of nine antiparallel α-helices forming a horseshoe-shaped dimer. The basis for dimer formation in 14-3-3σ is essentially the same as that of these other isotypes and involves a series of distributed interactions from residues in helices αA and αB in one monomer with residues in helices αC′ and αD′ in the other (Figs. 1A and 3B).Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsSpace group:C2221; a = 56.2 Å, b = 137.1 Å, c = 155.3 ÅAsymmetric unit:14-3-3 dimer with a phosphopeptide bound to each monomerData collectionWavelength (Å)0.97949Resolution (Å)40-2.4RsymaRsym = ΣhΣj|Ij(h) — 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣj 〈I(h)〉, where Ij(h) is the jth reflection of index h and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of all observations of I(h).0.095 (0.652)bValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin (2.49-2.40Å).Completeness (%)99.2 (99.3)Unique hkl reflections24,430Redundancy (-fold)15.1 (13.5)Average I/σ30.7 (5.4)Refinementhkl|F > 0| reflections22,712hkl (test set)2241Rwork (%)cRwork = Σh|Fobs(h) — Fcalc(h)∥/Σh|Fobs |(h)|, calculated over the 90% of the data in the working set.23.3Rfree (%)dRfree is equivalent to Rwork except calculated over the 10% of the data assigned to the test set.28.33656 protein atoms, 55 solvent atoms, 1 calcium ionRoot mean square deviationsBonds (Å)0.007Angles (degrees)1.07a Rsym = ΣhΣj|Ij(h) — 〈I(h)〉|/ΣhΣj 〈I(h)〉, where Ij(h) is the jth reflection of index h and 〈I〉 is the average intensity of all observations of I(h).b Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution bin (2.49-2.40Å).c Rwork = Σh|Fobs(h) — Fcalc(h)∥/Σh|Fobs |(h)|, calculated over the 90% of the data in the working set.d Rfree is equivalent to Rwork except calculated over the 10% of the data assigned to the test set.

In 14-3-3σ the angle between αA and αB is different from that in the ζ dimer. This difference may be related to the unique sequence of the BC loop in 14-3-3σ compared with that in other human isoforms. Across the dimer interface in the opposing monomer, the loop connecting helices αC′ and αD′, which contains two extra amino acids in 14-3-3σ, is disordered and helix αD′ is one turn shorter at its amino-terminal end than in the 14-3-3ζ structure. Helices αA and αD′ in the 14-3-3σ structure are observed to pack slightly closer together across the interface than in ζ (Fig. 3C), perhaps as a consequence of these changes. There are seven amino acid differences between 14-3-3σ and 14-3-3ζ at the dimer interface (six between σ and τ). Five of these amino acid substitutions are σ-specific and must provide a structural basis for σ homodimerization through stabilizing homodimeric interactions and destabilizing heterodimeric interactions. In the 14-3-3σ structure, Phe-25, which is unique to σ, makes a ring-ring inte"

Segmentation of the presomitic mesoderm must therefore be tightly coordinated along the left and right embryonic sides. We show that mutant mice defective for retinoic acid synthesis exhibit delayed somite formation on the right side. Asymmetric somite formation correlates with a left-right desynchronization of the segmentation clock oscillations. These data implicate retinoic acid as an endogenous signal that maintains the bilateral synchrony of mesoderm segmentation, and therefore controls bilateral symmetry, in vertebrate embryos."

The crystal structure of the three domains comprising the ectoplasmic region of the antigen from P. vivax , solved at 1.8 angstrom resolution, shows that domains I and II belong to the PAN motif, which defines a superfamily of protein folds implicated in receptor binding. We also mapped the epitope of an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody specific for the P. falciparum ortholog and modeled this to the structure. The location of the epitope and current knowledge on structure-function correlations for PAN domains together suggest a receptor-binding role during invasion in which domain II plays a critical part.

The MIMI sensors observed frequent energetic particle activity in interplanetary space for several months before SOI. When the imaging sensor was switched to its energetic neutral atom (ENA) operating mode on 20 February 2004, at â¼10 3 times Saturn's radius R S (0.43 astronomical units), a weak but persistent signal was observed from the magnetosphere. About 10 days before SOI, the magnetosphere exhibited a day-night asymmetry that varied with an â¼11-hour periodicity. Once Cassini entered the magnetosphere, in situ measurements showed high concentrations of H + , H 2 + , O + , OH + , and H 2 O + and low concentrations of N + . The radial dependence of ion intensity profiles implies neutral gas densities sufficient to produce high loss rates of trapped ions from the middle and inner magnetosphere. ENA imaging has revealed a radiation belt that resides inward of the D ring and is probably the result of double charge exchange between the main radiation belt and the upper layers of Saturn's exosphere."

High-quality water, nonsaline soils, and the densest native vegetation were found in the only remaining natural marsh, the Al-Hawizeh, located on the Iranian border. Although substantially reduced in area and under current threat of an Iranian dike, it has the potential to be a native repopulation center for the region. Rapid reestablishment, high productivity, and reproduction of native flora and fauna in reflooded former marsh areas indicate a high probability for successful restoration, provided the restored wetlands are hydraulically designed to allow sufficient flow of noncontaminated water and flushing of salts through the ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2156406678,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) induces apoptosis by its ability to bind insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) as well as its IGF-independent effects involving binding to other molecules including the retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα). Here we describe that in response to IGFBP-3, the RXRα binding partner nuclear receptor Nur77 rapidly undergoes translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria, initiating an apoptotic cascade resulting in caspase activation within 6 h. This translocation is a type 1 IGF receptor-signaling independent event as IGFBP-3 induces Nur77 translocation in R-cells. IGFBP-3 and Nur77 are additive in inducing apoptosis. GFP-Nur77 transfection into RXRα wild-type and knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts and subsequent treatment with IGFBP-3 show that RXRα is required for IGFBP-3-induced Nur77 translocation and apoptosis. Addition of IGFBP-3 to 22RV1 cell lysates enhanced the ability of GST-RXRα to “pull down” Nur77, and overexpression of IGFBP-3 enhanced the accumulation of mitochondrial RXRα. This unique nongenotropic nuclear pathway supports an emerging role for IGFBP-3 as a novel, multicompartmental signaling molecule involved in induction of apoptosis in malignant cells."

We first demonstrate that unlike several other nuclear receptors, PPARs do not form speckles upon ligand activation. The subnuclear structures that may be observed under some experimental conditions result from overexpression of the protein and our immunolabeling experiments suggest that these structures are subjected to degradation by the proteasome. Interestingly and in contrast to a general assumption, PPARs readily heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR) in the absence of ligand in living cells. PPAR diffusion coefficients indicate that all the receptors are engaged in complexes of very high molecular masses and/or interact with relatively immobile nuclear components. PPARs are not immobilized by ligand binding. However, they exhibit a ligand-induced reduction of mobility, probably due to enhanced interactions with cofactors and/or chromatin.

They compose a large family of ligand-activated proteins among which are the steroid hormone receptors, the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; VDR, vitamin D receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, PPAR response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; FP, fluorescent protein; GFP, green FP; YFP, yellow FP; CFP, cyan FP; EYFP, enhanced YFP; ECFP, enhanced CFP; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; AR, androgen receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RXR, retinoid X receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: TR, thyroid hormone receptor; VDR, vitamin D receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, PPAR response element; RXR, retinoid X receptor; FP, fluorescent protein; GFP, green FP; YFP, yellow FP; CFP, cyan FP; EYFP, enhanced YFP; ECFP, enhanced CFP; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; AR, androgen receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RXR, retinoid X receptor. the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the retinoic acid receptors (RARs), as well as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). It is generally assumed that, upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors either homodimerize or heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific responsive elements in the enhancer regions of their target genes. This promotes gene activation, after a complex array of events including both dissociation from and association with numerous cofactors (4Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The three PPAR isotypes (named α, β/δ, and γ or NR1C1, NR1C2, and NR1C3 (5Committee Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar)) are mainly involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis, regulation of food intake and body weight, and control of inflammation and wound healing (6Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 7Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). They are activated by naturally occurring or metabolized fatty acids derived from the diet or from intracellular signaling pathways and induce gene transcription as heterodimers with RXRs (8Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). PPARs are also very important therapeutic targets for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes.Recent developments in live cell imaging have prompted investigations on the localization and mobility of nuclear receptors to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation. Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (FPs) allow to monitor directly in living cells the behavior of proteins in their physiological context (9Lippincott-Schwartz J. Patterson G.H. Science. 2003; 300: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). For instance, it is possible to assess the dynamics of a protein by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and to evaluate the interaction between two proteins by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET).Classical confocal microscopy combined with the use of FPs has first allowed to address a particularly interesting issue: the modulation of nuclear receptor localization upon ligand binding. Ligand treatment induces a redistribution of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (10Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ligand binding promotes the formation of nuclear speckled patterns for ER, GR, AR, TR, RAR, and RXR (see Ref. 23DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar for a review). These induced clusters only partially overlap with sites of transcription (24Grande M.A. van der Kraan I. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their role in nuclear receptor function awaits further elucidation. The need for quantification for these events then lead to the use of more elaborated techniques, such as FRAP. Mobility studies have focused on the diffusion of receptors through the nucleoplasm on the one hand and at specific interaction sites on chromatin on the other (25McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 26Hinojos C.A. Sharp Z.D. Mancini M.A. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 12-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). FRAP revealed that nuclear receptors move rapidly and that, at least for ER and GR, their motion in the nucleoplasm can be modulated by ligand binding (18Reid G. Hubner M.R. Metivier R. Brand H.

Interestingly, other receptors such as TR and RAR do not exhibit the decreased mobility observed for ER and GR in the presence of ligand (19Maruvada P. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12425-12432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although recent reports have highlighted the influence of some molecular chaperones and of the proteasome on nuclear receptor mobility (18Reid G. Hubner M.R. Metivier R. Brand H. Denger S. Manu D.

A. 2004; 101: 2876-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is not clear at present which factors modulate and orientate nuclear receptor trafficking in the cell. The steps required to initiate transcription upon ligand binding (i.e. interaction with cofactors that allow chromatin remodeling and recruitment of the basic transcription machinery) also possibly influence nuclear receptor mobility. With that respect, FRET has emerged as a technique to characterize the mechanisms of cofactor recruitment following ligand binding in living cells (31Llopis J. Westin S. Ricote M. Wang Z. Cho C.Y. Kurokawa R. Mullen T.M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Tsien R.Y. Glass C.K. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4363-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Bai Y. Giguère V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).The microscopy studies published so far point to two major issues: first, despite some common features, each nuclear receptor displays specific distributions and dynamics, justifying a detailed analysis of each member of this family. Second, each technique has its own spatial and temporal resolutions, which sometimes limit a comprehensive study. Our aim here was to study PPAR action in living cells by combining complementary microscopy techniques. As a first step, we characterize the function of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-PPAR fluorescent chimeras. The presence and the physiological relevance of the fluorescent spots that may arise under certain experimental conditions was analyzed, and we demonstrate that these structures are non physiological and result from overexpression in individual cells. Regarding mobility, FRAP indicates that PPARs are highly mobile receptors that are not immobilized by ligand binding. A FCS study undertaken to circumvent FRAP time scale limitations gives two new major insights into PPAR behavior in living cells. First, in the absence of ligand, PPARs diffuse in the nucleus either in association with very big complexes and/or transiently interact with relatively immobile nuclear components. Second, ligand binding slows down PPARs, most probably by enhancing interactions with cofactors and chromatin. Moreover, FRET experiments demonstrate that PPARs readily form heterodimers with RXR in the absence of ligand. Finally, this study suggests guidelines for an appropriate examination of molecular behaviors in living cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Rosiglitazone and 17β-estradiol were purchased from Sigma, Wy14,643 from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI), and 9-cis-retinoic acid from Biomol Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). L-165041 was synthesized in the laboratory by Marco Alves. The antibody directed against PPARα has been previously described (33Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vazquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and those directed against PPARβ, PPARγ, and GFP were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), Wak-Chemie (Steinbach, Germany), and Roche Diagnostics (Rotkreuz, Switzerland), respectively. The antibodies against the α/β subunits of the 20 S proteasome and ubiquitylated proteins were from Affiniti Research Products (Mamhead, UK).Plasmid Constructs—cDNAs encoding mouse PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ1 as well as RXRα were subcloned after PCR amplification into the pEYFP-N1 and -C1, and pECFP-N1 and -C1 plasmids (Clontech) using XhoI/BamHI, BglII/SalI, XhoI/KpnI, and BglII/SalI restriction sites, respectively. Wild-type mPPARα was expressed from a cDNA cloned in the pBK-CMV vector. The pEYFPC1-ERα vector, the (PPRE)3-luciferase (Luc) reporter construct and the ECFP-DEVD-EYFP construct were kind gifts of Drs. H. Vogel (EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland), R. M. Evans (Salk institute, San Diego, CA), and J. M. Tavaré (West-phalian Wilhelms University, Münster, Germany), respectively.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—COS-7 and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) were added to the medium at 100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively.Transient transfection assays were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and luciferase activity assays were performed with the Promega dual reporter kit, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Renilla luciferase encoded by the normalization vector phRLTK (Promega) was used as an internal control for firefly luciferase normalization. Cells were plated in 12-well plates for luciferase assays or 4-well LabTek chambered coverglasses (Nunc) for microscopy studies. Unless otherwise stated, transfections were performed with 100 ng of vector per cm2 cell culture plate. After transfection, cells were left to recover in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 5 h and grown in serum-free medium in the presence of PPAR ligands or vehicles for 18 h. Ligand concentrations were: 10–5 m for Wy14,643, 5.10–6m for l-165041, 10–6 m for rosiglitazone, 10–6m for 9-cis-retinoic acid, and 10–8 m for 17β-estradiol.Western Blots—Cells or tissues were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 400 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, glycerol 20%) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) with a Dounce homogenizer. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE as previously described (34Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ were all used at dilutions of 1:2000 and the anti-GFP antibody was diluted 1:5000. Detection was performed using chemiluminescence (ECL advance, Amersham Biosciences).Pull-down Experiments—For DNA pull-downs, plates were coated with oligonucleotides containing the malic enzyme PPAR response element as previously described (35IJpenberg A. Tan N.S. Gelman L. Kersten S. Seydoux J. Xu J. Metzger D. Canaple L. Chambon P. Wahli W. Desvergne B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2083-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For cofactor pull-downs, the GST-p3002–516 fusion protein was purified as described previously (34Gelman L. Zhou G. Fajas L. Raspe E. Fruchart J.C. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For both DNA and cofactor pull-downs, whole-cell extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were incubated 2.5 h at 4 °C in pull-down buffer in the oligonucleotide coated plates or with the GST-p3002–516 coated beads, and the appropriate PPAR ligands (Wy14,643 at 100 μm, L-165041 at 50 μm, and rosiglitazone at 10 μm). Plates or beads were washed four times with binding buffer and samples were boiled with 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed by Western blot.Immunofluorescence—Wounded skin was prepared as described previously (36Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P. Rieusset J. Peters J.M. Kaya G. Gonzalez F.J. Zakany J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Duboule D. Wahli W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 799-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Skin cryosections or transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. For the anti-PPARβ immunofluorescence, after an antigen-unmasking step (citrate buffer, pH 6, 100 °C, 10 min), the following processing was applied: wash with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min; PBS for 5 min; 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratory) for 1 h; PBS, 2% BSA for 5 min. The primary antibody against PPARβ (Affinity Bioreagents) was applied overnight at 4 °C at 1/100th in PBS, 2% BSA, and slices were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Antibody incubations were followed by two 5-min washes in PBS, 2% BSA, and samples were mounted in DAPI containing-Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For the anti-20 S proteasome and anti-ubiquitin immunofluorescence, a classical protocol was applied using PBS, 2% BSA as a blocking agent and antibody dilutions of 1/1000 for 1 h and 1/500 overnight at 4 °C, respectively. Labeling was then performed with a chicken anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to Alexa594 (Molecular Probes).Confocal Imaging—Live cells on LabTek chambered coverglasses were washed once with phenol red free Optimem medium (Invitrogen) containing ligands or their vehicles and observed in the same medium. For perfusion experiments, cells were grown on 18-mm round coverglasses, placed in a Ludin perfusion chamber (Life Imaging Service), and perfused at 200 μl/min. All observations were performed at 37 °C on a TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with a whole-microscope incubator (Life Imaging Service). Acquisitions were performed with a 63×/NA 1.2 water immersion objective for live-cell imaging and a 63×/NA 1.4 oil immersion objective for immunofluorescence observation. Observation of EYFP fusion proteins was done by exciting at 514 nm and detecting emission between 525 and 575 nm. DAPI, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and Alexa594 were measured in the following respective settings: excitation 405 nm/emission 410–465 nm, excitation 488 nm/emission 500–600 nm, and excitation 594 nm/emission 620–660 nm. For quantitative analyses, background-corrected 8-bit images were acquired with identical settings (same laser power and detector gain) and quantified using the Leica Confocal Software version 2.4.FRET Experiments—Transfections were performed as described above, but expression levels of donor and acceptor proteins were adjusted to similar levels by Western blot. Fluorescence was recorded in three different settings: CFPex, 405 nm/CFPem, 465–485 nm; YFPex, 514 nm/YFPem, 525–545 nm; FRETex, 405 nm/FRETem, 525–545 nm. Laser power and detector gain were adjusted in the different channels to observe equimolar concentrations of CFP and YFP at equal intensities (equimolar concentrations of CFP and YFP were obtained by expressing a fusion protein of CFP and YFP spaced by 475 residues). Settings were kept unchanged for analysis of all samples. CFP and YFP spectral bleed-throughs (BT) in the FRET setting were determined on cells expressing CFP or YFP alone by calculating the intensity (I) ratios in the appropriate settings (IFRET/ICFP and IFRET/IYFP, respectively). FRET measured in co-expressing cells was then corrected for spectral bleed-throughs and normalized (NFRET) for expression levels according to the following formula (37Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). NFRET=IFRET−ICFP∗BTCFP−IYFP∗BTYFPICFP∗IYFP(Eq. 1) The image of FRET was generated with the “PixFRET” plug-in for the ImageJ software. This plug-in can be downloaded from www.unil.ch/cig/page16989.html.FRAP Experiments—FRAP experiments were performed on Leica TCS SP2 AOBS or Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopes. The LSM510 microscope was equipped with an argon 488-nm laser and a 505–550-nm bandpass filter, and image analysis was performed with the Zeiss LSM software version 3.2. For qualitative analysis (images only), images were acquired with a 256 × 256-pixel resolution. However, for the quantitative analysis presented in Fig. 5 (recovery curves), the resolution was switched to 128 × 128 pixels, and forward-reverse scanning was applied allowing acquisition of images every 100 ms. Photobleaching was performed with maximal laser power of the 488 laser line, and bleaching time was minimized by analyzing bleaching efficiency on fixed cells (eight scans at 800 Hz on the TCS SP2 and 50 iterations on the LSM510). In Fig. 6 (LSM510), the bleached region was a thin strip (100 × 5 pixels) across the nucleus not exceeding 10% of the total nucleus area. Experiments were performed with a pinhole set to 2.5 airy units. Fluorescence intensities were calculated in the bleached zone and over the entire cell nucleus with NIH ImageJ version 1.30 or Zeiss LSM softwares. Fluorescence recovery was normalized to the bleaching of the entire nucleus as described previously (38Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar): recovery = (It/Io)*(To/Tt), where It is the average intensity in the region of interest in time point t, Io the average intensity in the region of interest during prebleach, Tt is the total nuclear intensity at time point t, and To is the average total nuclear intensity during prebleach. To extract half-recovery times and percentages of immobilization, the Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) was used for nonlinear regression analysis. Recovery curves were fitted to the following equation. y(t)=y0+A1·(1−e−B1·t)+A2·(1−e−B2·t)(Eq. 2) Maximal recovery (Mr) was the sum of y0, A1, and A2, and half-recovery time the value of t when y = Mr/2.Fig. 6FRAP reveals that EYFP-PPARs are highly mobile both in ligand treated and untreated cells. Live COS-7 cells displaying a diffuse pattern for EYFP-PPARα (A), EYFP-ERα (B), EYFP-PPARβ (C), EYFP-PPARγ1 (D), EYFP-PPARα with wild-type RXRα (E) or EYFP-RXRα (F) were subjected to FRAP analysis on a Zeiss LSM510 microscope in the absence or presence of the respective ligands. For each condition, the normalized fluorescence recovery was averaged over 12 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FCS Experiments—FCS measurements were performed on a commercial LSM510 ConfoCor2 combination system (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at room temperature. The 488-nm line of an argon-ion laser was focused through a Zeiss C-Apochromat 40×, NA 1.2 water immersion objective, and the fluorescence emission was recorded between 505 and 550 nm. The pinhole diameter was set to 90 μm, and detection was achieved using an avalanche photodiode. The 1/e2 lateral radii of the detection volume was determined to be ∼0.18 μm (488 nm excitation) from calibration measurements using standard dye (Rhodamine 6G, Molecular Probes). This value was used to convert diffusion times into diffusion coefficients. The setup was shown to be able to produce correct diffusion coefficients (39Krouglova T. Vercammen J. Engelborghs Y. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2635-2646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity fluctuations were recorded at five spots in each nucleus. At each spot, measurements were performed over 25 s and repeated five times. On average, nine cells were analyzed. The autocorrelation curves were fitted to a one component model of free diffusion in three dimensions to derive the translational diffusion time through the confocal volume. Data were evaluated by Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares fitting to the appropriate model equations, using the ConfoCor2 or Origin software. The sizes of the EYFP-PPAR complexes were estimated by multiplying the molecular mass of EYFP by the factor (DEYFP/DEYFP-PPAR)3, assuming spherical symmetry of the complexes and normal diffusion in the viscous medium of the nucleus (i.e. EYFP experiences the same viscosity as the EYFP-PPAR complexes (40Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)).RESULTSCharacterization of EYFP-PPAR Chimeras—To monitor PPAR action in living cells, we constructed expression vectors for the different PPAR isotypes fused to EYFP either at their N or C terminus (EYFP-PPAR and PPAR-EYFP, respectively). Proper expression of the EYFP-PPARα, -β, and -γ1 fusion proteins in COS-7 cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Expression levels were not affected by the position of the fluorescent tag (data not shown).Fig. 1Functional characterization of the EYFP-PPARs. A, Western blot analysis of EYFP-PPARα, EYFP-PPARβ, and EYFP-PPARγ expression in transfected COS-7 cells. Samples were resolved as described under “Experimental Procedures” with isotype-specific antibodies. B, independent DNA and cofactor interaction assays were performed using either a biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a PPRE (DNA pull-down) or GST-p300 (cofactor pull-down). Interactions with PPARα, EYFP-PPARα, or PPARα-EYFP from COS-7 cell extracts were analyzed in the absence or presence of 100 μm of Wy14,643 and resolved with an anti-PPARα antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2000660632,"Phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism controlling circadian clocks. In the Neurospora circadian clock, the PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain-containing transcription factor, WHITE COLLAR (WC)-1, acts both as the blue light photoreceptor of the clock and as a positive element in the circadian negative feedback loop in constant darkness, by activating the transcription of the frequency (frq) gene. To understand the role of WC-1 phosphorylation, five in vivo WC-1 phosphorylation sites, located immediately downstream of the WC-1 zinc finger DNA binding domain, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry using biochemically purified endogenous WC-1 protein. Mutations of these phosphorylation sites suggest that they are major WC-1 phosphorylation sites under constant conditions but are not responsible for the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1. Although phosphorylation of these sites does not affect the light function of WC-1, strains carrying mutations of these sites show short period, low amplitude, or arrhythmic conidiation rhythms in constant darkness. Furthermore, normal or slightly higher levels of frq mRNA and FRQ proteins were observed in a mutant strain containing mutations of all five sites despite its low WC-1 levels. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of these sites negatively regulates the function of WC-1 in the circadian negative feedback loop and is important for the function of the Neurospora circadian clock. Phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism controlling circadian clocks. In the Neurospora circadian clock, the PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) domain-containing transcription factor, WHITE COLLAR (WC)-1, acts both as the blue light photoreceptor of the clock and as a positive element in the circadian negative feedback loop in constant darkness, by activating the transcription of the frequency (frq) gene. To understand the role of WC-1 phosphorylation, five in vivo WC-1 phosphorylation sites, located immediately downstream of the WC-1 zinc finger DNA binding domain, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry using biochemically purified endogenous WC-1 protein. Mutations of these phosphorylation sites suggest that they are major WC-1 phosphorylation sites under constant conditions but are not responsible for the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1. Although phosphorylation of these sites does not affect the light function of WC-1, strains carrying mutations of these sites show short period, low amplitude, or arrhythmic conidiation rhythms in constant darkness. Furthermore, normal or slightly higher levels of frq mRNA and FRQ proteins were observed in a mutant strain containing mutations of all five sites despite its low WC-1 levels. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of these sites negatively regulates the function of WC-1 in the circadian negative feedback loop and is important for the function of the Neurospora circadian clock. Eukaryotic circadian oscillators consist of autoregulatory transcription/translation-based negative feedback loops (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2341) Google Scholar, 2Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 702-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In these negative feedback loops, the positive elements activate the transcription of the negative elements, whereas the negative elements inhibit their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the positive elements. In the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop, such as those in Drosophila and mammals, the positive element is a heterodimeric complex made of two PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS) 1The abbreviations used are: PAS, PER-ARNT-SIM; WC, WHITE COLLAR; frq, frequency; PKC, protein kinase C; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DD, constant darkness; LL, constant light; LD, light/dark. 1The abbreviations used are: PAS, PER-ARNT-SIM; WC, WHITE COLLAR; frq, frequency; PKC, protein kinase C; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; DD, constant darkness; LL, constant light; LD, light/dark. domain-containing transcription factors, WHITE COLLAR (WC)-1 and WC-2. In the dark, the two WC proteins form a heterodimer through their PAS domains and activate the transcription of the frequency (frq) gene by directly binding to its promoter (3Froehlich A.C.

When the amount of FRQ protein reaches a certain level, the homodimeric FRQ in complex with FRH, a FRQ-interacting RNA helicase, represses frq transcription by interacting with the WC complex and preventing its binding to the frq promoter, thus closing the negative feedback loop (3Froehlich A.C.

In addition to their essential role in the circadian negative feedback loop in the dark, WC-1 and WC-2 are required for all known light responses in Neurospora, including the entrainment of the circadian clock (4Crosthwaite S.K.

Nature. 2002; 420: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In Neurospora, FRQ, WC-1, and WC-2 proteins are all phosphorylated in vivo (9Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G.

Extensive studies of FRQ phosphorylation revealed that its phosphorylation status is determined by both kinases and phosphatases. Casein kinases I and II, and a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase have been shown to be the kinases that phosphorylate FRQ (38Yang Y. Cheng P. Zhi G. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41064-41072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 39Yang Y. Cheng P. Liu Y.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7074-7084Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A counter the effects of the kinase by dephosphorylating FRQ (42Yang Y. He Q. Cheng P. Wrage P. Yarden O. Liu Y. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FRQ promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by FWD-1, an F-box/WD40 repeat-containing protein, which is part of an SCF-type ubiquitin E3 ligase (29Liu Y. Loros J. Dunlap J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 43He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. He Q. Yu H. Liu Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the phosphorylation of FRQ regulates the FRQ-WC interaction and is important for the role of FRQ to repress the activity of the WC complex (39Yang Y. Cheng P. Liu Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 994-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 40Yang Y. Cheng P. He Q. Wang L. Liu Y. Mol. Cell.

Thus, regulation of FRQ phosphorylation states by its kinases and phosphatases is critical for circadian periodicity and proper function of the clock. Like the positive elements in the circadian negative feedback loops of Drosophila and mammals (31Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 44Lee C. Bae K. Edery I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), WC-1 and WC-2 proteins are phosphorylated under constant conditions (36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similar to other blue light photoreceptors, such as the plant cryptochromes and phototropins (32Eide E.J. Vielhaber E.L. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17248-17254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 45Shalitin D. Yang H. Mockler T.C. Maymon M. Guo H. Whitelam G.C.

Science. 1998; 282: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), the WC proteins become hyperphosphorylated after light exposure. The functions of these WC phosphorylation events are not known. Previously, pharmacological studies and in vitro phosphorylation assay suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) might be a kinase that phosphorylates WC-1 (47Arpaia G. Cerri F. Baima S. Macino G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Treatment of Neurospora cells by PKC inhibitors led to increased and prolonged light-induced transcription, suggesting that PKC may be a negative regulator of light responses in Neurospora. On the other hand, the transient nature of WC-1 hyperphosphorylation after light exposure and faster degradation rate of WC-1 under light than in the dark suggest that light-induced phosphorylation may lead to WC-1 degradation (36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 48Lee K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2000; 289: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). WC-1 and WC-2 form WC complexes through the PASC region of WC-1 and the PAS domain of WC-2 (6Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Even though the WC complexes activate gene transcription both in the dark and after light exposure, these two functions can be separated molecularly. The deletion of the WC-1 LOV domain abolishes the light function of the protein, but not its dark function (22He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). On the other hand, deletion of the zinc finger DNA binding domain of WC-1 eliminates the dark function of the protein, but not its light function (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, WC-1 uses different domains of the protein to carry out its roles in gene activation in the dark and after light exposure. Therefore, regulation of different domains of WC-1 is likely to have a different impact on these two functions. In this study, to understand the role of WC-1 phosphorylation in the regulation of circadian clock and light responses, we identified five in vivo WC-1 phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry analyses. These sites are located immediately downstream of the zinc finger DNA binding domain. Mutation of these phosphorylation sites showed that although they are not required for the light function of the protein, they negatively regulate the activity of WC-1 in the dark and are important for the function of the circadian clock. Strains, Culture Conditions, and Race Tube Assay—The bd, a (containing a wild-type clock) strain was used as the wild-type strain in this study. A wc-1RIP strain was used as the host strain for various his-3-targeting wc1-2 constructs (22He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Liquid culture conditions were as described previously (8Aronson B. Johnson K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Race tube assay media contained 1× Vogel's, 0.1% glucose, 0.17% arginine, and 50 ng/ml biotin. Densitometric analyses of race tubes and calculations of period length were performed as previously described using Chrono II version 11.1 (49Roenneberg T. Taylor W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 305: 104-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested by filtration either under red safety light or after light treatments (1600 LUX). For rhythmic experiments, the Neurospora cultures were moved from LL to DD at time 0 and were harvested in constant darkness at the indicated times (hours). Identification of in Vivo WC-1 Phosphorylation Sites by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Purification of the WC complex was as previously described (22He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE gel was stained with colloidal blue (Invitrogen). Phosphorylation sites were identified by a combination of precursor ion scanning and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The colloidal blue-stained WC-1 protein bands were excised from SDS gels and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin essentially as described previously (50Shu, H., Chen, S., DeCamp, D., Hsueh, R. C., Mumby, M., and Brekken, D. (2003) AfCS Research Reports http://www.signaling-gateway.org/reports/v1/DA0008/DA0008.pdf,Google Scholar). The dried protein digests were dissolved in 5% formic acid and loaded onto a pulled capillary filled with POROS R2 resin. After washing three times with 5% formic acid, the peptides were eluted into a nanoelectrospray needle with 1–2 μl of nanoelectrospray sample solutions for either precursor ion scanning in negative ion mode or MS/MS in positive ion mode. All mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a QSTAR Pulsar-i quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Proteomics, Odense, Denmark). For precursor ion scanning experiments, the instrument was set in negative ion mode, with the quadrupole Q2 pulsing function turned on, to detect the PO3− fragment ion at m/z–79. The optimum collision energies were determined for each experiment by gradually increasing the voltage of Q0 in steps corresponding to one-twentieth of the m/z value of the precursor ion. After data acquisition by precursor ion scanning, the instrument was switched to positive ion mode, and the phosphopeptide sequence and sites of phosphorylation were identified by nanoelectrospray MS/MS. In the MS/MS scan mode, precursor ions were selected in quadrupole Q1 and fragmented in the collision cell (q2), using argon as the collision gas. Plasmid Constructs and Neurospora Transformation—All point mutations of the WC-1 phosphorylation sites were constructed by using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (BD Biosciences) using pwc1-3 as the template. The mutagenic primers used were WC1.990A (Ser-990 to Ala), WC1.988.2A (Ser-988 and Ser-990 to Ala), WC1.992.3A (Ser-992, Ser-994, and Ser-995 to Ala), and WC1.988.5A (Ser-988, Ser-990, Ser-992, Ser-994, and Ser-995 to Ala). After mutagenesis, the NsiI-AgeI-digested wc-1 fragments from the constructs were inserted into the NsiI-AgeI-digested pwc1-2 construct. All resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and then targeted to the his-3 locus of the wc-1RIP strain by transformation. Protein and RNA Analyses—Protein and RNA analyses were as previously described (8Aronson B. Johnson K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 9Garceau N. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 469-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 11Cheng P. Yang Y. Heintzen C. Liu Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total protein (50 μg) were loaded in each protein lane, and the blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blot analysis, equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg) were loaded onto agarose gels for electrophoresis, and the gels were blotted and probed with RNA probe specific for vvd, al-3, and frq. Densitometric analysis of the data was performed using National Institutes of Health IMAGE 1.61. For phosphatase treatments, 50 μg of total protein was diluted in 1× phosphatase buffer and treated with 1000 units of λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. Identification of Five in Vivo WC-1 Phosphorylation Sites by Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Previously, we created a Neurospora strain (Myc-His-WC-2) in which WC-2 was tagged by both c-Myc and His6 epitope tags (22He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We showed that the Myc-His-WC-2 can form a functional complex with WC-1 and can rescue the light and circadian clock defects of a wc-2-null strain. Using this strain, we developed a biochemical purification protocol that can obtain pure WC complex. To identify WC-1 phosphorylation sites in vivo, large-scale purifications were carried out using extracts of the Mys-His-WC-2 strain grown in DD. In DD, the phosphorylation profile of WC-1 is similar to that of the LL condition, lacking the hyperphosphorylated WC-1 species induced by a light pulse (36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 37Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The left panel of Fig. 1A shows the colloidal blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel of the purification products. Similar to our previous result, the WC complex was purified to near homogeneity. The minor bands are mostly degradation products of the WC proteins, except for one contaminating band (labeled with an asterisk). To confirm that the purified WC proteins are still phosphorylated after the purification procedure, a small portion of the purification products were subjected to λ-phosphatase treatment. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1A, the phosphatase treatment led to the disappearance of the slow mobility WC-1 species, indicating that they were phosphorylated WC-1. No significant gel mobility difference was observed with Myc-WC-2 after the treatment, suggesting that the majority of WC-2 was not phosphorylated under this condition (36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, we only used the purified WC-1 protein for phosphorylation site mapping studies. The colloidal blue-stained protein bands corresponding to WC-1 were excised from SDS gels and subjected to trypsin digestion. The resulting peptides were then analyzed by nanoelectrospray MS/MS (50Shu, H., Chen, S., DeCamp, D., Hsueh, R. C., Mumby, M., and Brekken, D. (2003) AfCS Research Reports http://www.signaling-gateway.org/reports/v1/DA0008/DA0008.pdf,Google Scholar). Most of the identified phosphopeptides match to one trypsin-digested fragment, corresponding to amino acids 988–999 of WC-1. Fig. 1B shows a representative result of the MS/MS analysis for one of the phosphopeptides, which carries a single phosphorylated serine. In this peptide, Ser-990 was identified as the phosphorylation site. Additional mass spectrometry results indicate that, in some of the phosphopeptides, all five serines in this fragment are phosphorylated. Thus, Ser-988, Ser-990, Ser-992, Ser-994, and Ser-995 are WC-1 phosphorylation sites in vivo. The protein fragment containing these five phosphorylation sites is located immediately downstream of the zinc finger DNA binding domain (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, two of the phosphorylated serines are followed by a proline residue, suggesting that these phosphorylation events may be mediated by a proline-directed kinase. Phosphorylation of These Sites is Light-independent—Although mass spectrometry can identify in vivo phosphorylation sites, it does not provide information on the extent of phosphorylation of the identified sites in vivo. To confirm that these five residues represent major WC-1 phosphorylation sites in vivo under different conditions, constructs were created in which these sites were mutated to alanines either singly or in combination, and the constructs were transformed into a wc-1-null strain (wc-1RIP) (22He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, mutation of three of the sites (3A; S988A/S990A/S992A) or all five sites (5A; all five sites were mutated to alanines) led to mostly hypophosphorylated WC-1 forms in LL and DD, as indicated by the significantly reduced phosphorylated WC-1 species and the result of the phosphatase treatment. These data indicate that these sites are major WC-1 phosphorylation sites under constant conditions. To examine whether the phosphorylation of these sites is responsible for the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1, phosphorylation profiles of WC-1 of the wild-type and 5A strains were monitored after a transition from DD to LL. As shown in Fig. 2C, after 15–30 min of light treatment, the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1 was similar in both the wild-type and 5A strains. Together with the results in Fig. 2, A and B, these data suggest that these five phosphorylation sites are not involved in the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1 and that their phosphorylation is light-independent. To exclude the possibility that the normal light-induced WC-1 hyperphosphorylation profile observed in the 5A mutant was due to phosphorylation of other unidentified sites in this region, we monitored the light-induced WC-1 phosphorylation in two additional mutant strains, bNLS (deletion of the putative nuclear localization signal and the WC-1 C-terminal region) and NLSa (deletion of the zinc finger and the C-terminal region) (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), in which the entire zinc finger region and C-terminal part of the protein were deleted. As shown in Fig. 2D, the light-induced hyperphosphorylation of WC-1 was maintained in these two strains, indicating that the light-dependent hyperphosphorylation of WC-1 is due to phosphorylation of unidentified sites in the N-terminal part of WC-1. Because the size of WC-1 in these deletion mutants is smaller than the wild-type WC-1, their light-induced phosphorylation appeared to be more extensive. In addition to the hypophosphorylation of WC-1 in the 3A and 5A mutants, their WC-1 levels were significantly reduced compared with the wild-type strain. The levels of WC-1 in the 3A and 5A mutants were about 30% and 20% of the wild-type levels, respectively, suggesting that the phosphorylation of these sites may be important for maintaining the steady-state levels of WC-1. The low levels of the WC-1 proteins in the mutants are not due to their expression at the his-3 locus because the wild-type wc-1 construct (wc1-2) was expressed at normal level (Fig. 2A). In addition, Northern blot analysis showed that the expression levels of wc-1 mRNA in the mutants were comparable with that of the wild-type strain (data not shown). When WC-1 stability was measured in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, the degradation rates of WC-1 were not significantly different between the wild-type and the 5A strains (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the phosphorylation of these sites does not promote WC-1 degradation. Thus, it is likely that these mutations may affect WC-1 protein folding after its synthesis (improperly folded protein would be quickly degraded), leading to low levels of WC-1 without affecting the stability of the properly folded protein. Light-induced Transcription in the 5A Mutant—To examine whether the phosphorylation of these five sites regulates the light function of WC-1, light-induced transcription in the 5A mutant was compared with that in the wild-type strain. Light induction of albino-1 (al-3), vivid (vvd), and frq was examined by Northern blot analysis due to their different WC-1 level requirements for light-induced transcription (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y. He Q. Cheng P. Cell. Mol.

A. 2003; 100: 5938-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Light induction for genes such as al-3 is very sensitive to changes in WC-1 levels, whereas near normal light induction of frq can be observed even when the WC-1 level is very low. The WC-1 requirement for vvd light induction is between those of al-1 and frq. In the 5A mutant, as shown in Fig. 3, the light induction of al-3 was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A), whereas the light induction of vvd was only modestly affected (Fig. 3B). For frq, induction in the mutant was similar to that of the wild-type strain. Because of the different WC-1 requirements for light induction of these three genes, the changes in light-induced transcription observed for al-1 and vvd are most likely due to the reduction of WC-1 levels in the 5A mutant rather than changes in WC-1 activity. Thus, phosphorylation of these five sites does not appear to regulate the light function of WC-1. This interpretation is consistent with our previous results that normal light-induced transcription was observed in strains lacking the WC-1 zinc finger domain and the C-terminal region including these sites (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Short Period, Low Amplitude, or Arrhythmic Conidiation Rhythms in DD When WC-1 Phosphorylation Sites Are Mutated—Because the zinc finger DNA binding domain of WC-1 is required for its dark function but not its light function (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the identified phosphorylation sites are immediately downstream of the zinc finger domain, it is likely that these phosphorylation events regulate the function of WC-1 in the circadian feedback loop in the dark. Thus, we examined the circadian conidiation rhythms of the wc-1RIP strains carrying a construct with either a single or multiple WC-1 phosphorylation site mutations in DD. In addition to its arrhythmicity on race tubes, our wc-1RIP strain showed a faster growth rate (∼15%) than the wild type on race tubes, similar to other previously described wc-1 mutants (20Lee K. Dunlap J.C. Loros J.J. Genetics. 2003; 163: 103-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, a wild-type wc-1 construct (WC1-2) (6Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was able to rescue the robust circadian conidiation rhythmicity of the wc-1RIP strain with a period that was ∼1 h longer than that of the wild type. Mutation of a single phosphorylation site (1A; S990A) was also able to rescue the conidiation rhythm; however, its period was 1.6 h shorter than that of the WC1-2 strain. A short period conidiation rhythm was also observed in the 2A strain (S988A/S990A), but its conidiation rhythm became less robust than the 1A strain, as indicated by its broad conidiation bands. When three (3A; S988A/S990A/S992A) or all five sites (5A) were mutated, even though the conidiation bands can be observed in the first 2 days, conidiation became arrhythmic or oscillated with a low amplitude in the following days in DD. The growth rates of these mutants resemble that of the wc-1RIP strain, probably due to their low WC-1 levels. Previously, we have shown that high WC-1 levels lead to a modestly shorter period length of the clock (5Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, the short period rhythms of the phosphorylation site mutants are unlikely to be due to their low WC-1 levels. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of WC-1 at these sites is important for its role as a positive element in the circadian negative feedback loop. Like the wild-type strain, conidiation of all mutant strains could be entrained by light/dark (LD) cycles (Fig. 4B), further indicating that these WC-1 phosphorylation events are not required for its light function. Circadian Expression of frq mRNA and FRQ Protein—WC-1 is the limiting protein in the WC complex for its dark and light functions, so that low levels of WC-1 will result in low levels of frq transcription (5Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Denault D.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of robust circadian rhythmicity in DD in the 3A and 5A mutants could be due to their low levels of WC-1 (Fig. 2), even though we have previously shown that similar levels of wild-type WC-1 can support robust clock function (5Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). If so, frq mRNA and FRQ protein levels should be low in these mutants if their WC-1 activities are not altered. To examine this possibility, frq mRNA and FRQ protein levels were monitored in DD for 48 h after the LD transition. As shown in Fig. 5, circadian rhythms of frq mRNA could be observed in the 5A mutant, and the levels of frq RNA are comparable to, if not slightly higher than, those in the wild-type strain. In addition, frq mRNA peaked earlier in the mutant than the wild-type strain, suggesting a short period. The low levels of WC-1 protein and the normal levels of frq mRNA and its earlier peaks in the 5A strain suggest that its WC-1 activity in activating frq in the dark is increased in this strain compared with the wild-type protein. At the protein level, FRQ oscillates robustly both in its amount and phosphorylation states in the wild-type strain in DD (Fig. 6). For the 5A mutant, however, low amplitude rhythms of FRQ levels and phosphorylation states were seen for the first 2 days in DD, and the overall levels of FRQ in the 5A mutant were slightly higher than those of the wild-type strain. The low amplitude FRQ rhythm of the 5A strain (especially after 28 h in DD) is consistent with its race tube pheno-type in the first 2 days in DD. The comparison of the phosphorylation profile of FRQ between the two strains indicates that the 5A mutant has a shorter period than the wild type (note the ratio between extensively phosphorylated FRQ and newly synthesized hypophosphorylated FRQ at 12 and 28 h). Because the conidiation of the 5A strain became arrhythmic after 2 days in DD, the molecular rhythms observed here are likely due to the light/dark transition. Immunoprecipitation assays suggest that the interaction between FRQ and the WC complex is not affected by the phosphorylation site mutations (data not shown). Together, these molecular data indicate that the lack of robust circadian rhythmicity in the phosphorylation site mutants is not due to their low WC-1 levels, suggesting that the phosphorylation of WC-1 at these sites negatively regulates its activity as a positive element in the circadian negative feedback loop. Phosphorylation of clock proteins is critical for functions of circadian clocks in eukaryotic systems. WC-1, an essential component of the Neurospora circadian clock, functions both as the blue light photoreceptor mediating light input into the clock and as a positive element in the circadian negative feedback loop in the dark, by activating frq transcription. In this study, using mass spectrometry analyses, we identified five in vivo WC-1 phosphorylation sites near the WC-1 zinc finger DNA binding domain. Mutations of these sites indicate that these phosphorylation events are not required for the light function of WC-1, but they are important for the function of WC-1 as an activator of frq expression in the dark. Strains with one or two of the phosphorylation sites mutated showed short period circadian rhythms, whereas strains with three or five sites mutated exhibited arrhythmic or low amplitude circadian conidiation rhythms. In the mutant with all five sites mutated, despite its low WC-1 levels, the amounts of frq mRNA and FRQ protein in DD are comparable with or slightly higher than those of the wild-type strain. Because the amounts of WC-1 determine the expression level of frq in the dark in a wild-type strain (5Cheng P. Yang Y. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7408-7413Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), these data suggest that these phosphorylation events negatively regulate the transcription activator activity of WC-1 in the dark. The short period phenotype of the phosphorylation site mutants, therefore, is likely due to their increased activities of WC-1, resulting in earlier activation of frq transcription than seen in the wild-type strain. This interpretation is consistent with the advanced phases of the frq mRNA and FRQ protein observed in the 5A mutant (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, the regulation of WC-1 activity by phosphorylation of these sites is important for period determination and proper function of the circadian clock. Because the identified phosphorylation sites reside immediately downstream of the WC-1 zinc finger region, which is essential for the dark function of WC-1 but not required for its light function, it is likely that the phosphorylation of this region negatively regulate the DNA binding ability of WC-1 in the dark. This is the first time that in vivo phosphorylation sites and their function have been revealed for a positive element in a eukaryotic circadian negative feedback loop. Like the WC proteins in Neurospora, the positive elements of the circadian negative feedback loop in Drosophila (dCLOCK) and mouse (CLOCK and BMAL1) are phosphorylated in vivo (31Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R. Loudon A.S. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 44Lee C. Bae K. Edery I. Neuron. 1998; 21: 857-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but the sites and roles of their phosphorylation are not known. Hyperphosphorylation of WC-1 was previously observed to be associated with WC-1 degradation in LL (36Talora C. Franchi L. Linden H. Ballario P. Macino G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4961-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 48Lee K. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Science. 2000; 289: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation probably promotes WC-1 degradation. However, in strains with mutations of the identified phosphorylation sites, WC-1 levels are low, and the stability of WC-1 is not significantly altered. In addition, the phosphorylation of these sites is light-independent. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of these five sites does not lead to WC-1 degradation. Thus, the likely role of phosphorylation in regulating WC-1 stability is due to light-dependent phosphorylation of WC-1 in the N-terminal part of the protein. The sites of these phosphorylation events remain to be identified. Pharmacological studies previously suggested that PKC acts as a negative regulator of light responses in Neurospora, probably by regulating the function of the WC complex directly or indirectly (47Arpaia G. Cerri F. Baima S. Macino G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In vitro, PKC can phosphorylate the zinc finger region of WC-1, but it is unclear whether this phosphorylation is relevant in vivo. Although the phosphorylation sites we identified here are located in the zinc finger region, their phosphorylation is unlikely to be due to PKC phosphorylation. First, the amino acid sequence surrounding these five sites does not resemble those of the PKC consensus phosphorylation sites (S/TXK/R), although there are putative sites similar to the PKC sites in the zinc finger region. Second, mutations of these sites or deletions of the zinc finger region do not appear to affect the light-dependent WC-1 phosphorylation and the function of WC-1 in light-induced transcription (7Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. He Q. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3801-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of PKC in regulating light responses is probably not through its phosphorylation of the zinc finger region of WC-1. The proline residues next to two of the phosphorylation sites suggest that their phosphorylation is likely mediated by a proline-directed kinase. Interestingly, glycogen synthase kinase-3, a known proline-directed kinase (51Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 52Sasaki T. Taoka M.

https://openalex.org/W1998917750,"Amphetamine (AMPH) is a psychostimulant whose chronic abuse may cause impairments in attention and memory in humans. These cognitive deficits might be related to neurotoxic effects of the drug. One such toxic effect is the well-described destruction of striatal dopaminergic terminals in mammals. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that AMPH might also cause neuronal apoptosis in the rodent striatum. Administration of a dose of the drug (10 mg/kg, 4 times, every 2 h) that is toxic to dopaminergic terminals resulted in the appearance of striatal cells that were positive for cleaved caspase-3 and for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), observations that are indicative of an ongoing apoptotic process. Dual immunofluorescence staining revealed that cleaved caspase-3-positive cells express calbindin and DARPP-32, but not somatostatin, parvalbumin, or cholinergic markers. In addition, AMPH also caused increased expression of p53 and Bax at both transcript and protein levels; in contrast, Bcl-2 levels were decreased after the AMPH injections. Moreover, Bax knockout mice showed resistance to AMPH-induced apoptotic cell death but not to AMPH-induced destruction of dopaminergic terminals. When taken together, these observations indicate that injections of doses of AMPH that are known to destroy striatal dopamine terminals can also cause apoptotic death of postsynaptic medium spiny projection neurons via mitochondria-dependent mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2029794495,"Thrombin is a mitogen and chemoattractant for vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and may contribute to vascular lesion formation. We have previously shown that human SMCs, when stimulated with thrombin, release basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), causing phosphorylation of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1). Treatment with bFGF-neutralizing antibodies (anti-bFGF) or heparin inhibits thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. We concluded that thrombin may stimulate entry into the cell cycle via bFGF release and FGFR-1 activation. In the present study, we demonstrate a requirement for not only FGFR-1 but also syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan-sulfate proteoglycan. Inhibition of syndecan-4 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in reduced DNA synthesis by human SMCs after stimulation with thrombin (10 nmol/liter). Anti-bFGF antibody, which inhibits DNA synthesis in control cells, had no inhibitory effect when syndecan-4 expression was reduced by siRNA. Thrombin- or bFGF-induced SMC migration, determined in Boyden chamber assays, was reduced in cells treated with syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA or by anti-bFGF. Thrombin induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 in a biphasic pattern. Although thrombin-mediated ERK phosphorylation at 5 min was not affected by syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA, ERK phosphorylation at later time points was reduced.

The G-protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin may contribute to disease progression through stimulation of mitogenic signaling. In a previous study with cultured human SMCs, we demonstrated that thrombin releases basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which is bound to the pericellular matrix and causes phosphorylation of the FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) (3Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Preventing FGFR-1 phosphorylation by bFGF-neutralizing antibodies or by heparin inhibits thrombin-induced mitogenesis. Since heparin binds bFGF and inhibits bFGF-FGFR-1 interactions, we hypothesized that an endogenous heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) may be involved in mediating the effects of thrombin-released bFGF and thus be required for thrombin-induced mitogenesis. Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane HSPG with a core protein of 35 kDa carrying mainly heparan sulfate side chains (4Bellin R. Capila I. Lincecum J. Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M.R. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Syndecans and the HSPG glypican have been shown to bind bFGF and increase bFGF-FGFR-1 interactions (5Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Of the family of syndecans (syndecan-1 to -4), syndecan-4 is the only member with an intracellular domain that is capable of binding phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and protein kinase C α (PKCα), which allows it to support PKC-mediated signaling (6Oh E.S.

It clusters in focal contacts and affects integrin function, thereby modulating cell adhesion, migration, and morphology (9Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R.

Since thrombin activates FGFR-1 by releasing bFGF into the pericellular matrix and syndecan-4 functions as a mediator for bFGF signaling and a cofactor for FGFR-1 (for a review, see Ref. 13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that thrombin-induced mitogenesis and migration require syndecan-4 for binding thrombin-released bFGF.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1367-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, once with medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, and allowed to recover for at least 9 h. Cells were detached with trypsin, counted, and reseeded for experiments in 15% serum. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation of FGFR-1 was carried out as described previously (3Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For detection of syndecan-4 or HSPG neo-epitope (ΔHS), cells were lysed with 8 m urea buffer (25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 8 m urea, pH 7.5, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were frozen at –80 °C to disrupt syndecan-4 dimers (13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were dialyzed against 0.1 mol/liter sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mmol/liter calcium acetate. Samples were concentrated using centrifugal filter tubes (Amicon®, cut-off 10,000, Millipore, MA) and resuspended in 100 μl of digestion buffer (10 mmol/liter calcium acetate, 18 mmol/liter sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were incubated with heparitinase I–III (10 units/ml heparitinase I and II, 2.5 units/ml heparitinase III) for 4 h at 37 °C to digest HS side chains. Protein concentrations were determined to ensure equal protein loading. To determine ERK phosphorylation, cells were seeded into 6-well plates (80,000–100,000 cells/well) and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h with a change of medium 24 h before stimulation. For Western blot analysis, samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. Primary antibodies used were monoclonal Ab against syndecan-4 (clone 5G9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ΔHS (clone 3G10, Seikagaku Corp.), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-FGFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (kit from Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results were quantified by densitometry of films using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Untreated SMCs or those transfected with 10 nmol/liter siRNA were seeded into 100-mm dishes (5–6 × 105 cells/dish) and incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h. RNA was prepared using RNeasy® spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed with Ready-To-Go™ RT-RCR Beads (Amersham Biosciences) using 1 μg of total RNA and 15 pmol of primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer pairs, product size, and annealing temperature were as follows: FGFR-1, sense, 5′-CGGTGTGCCTGTGGAGGAACTT-3′, antisense, 5′-GTTACAGCTGACGGTGGAGTCT-3′ (408-bp fragment, 65 °C) (17Jayson G.C. Vives C. Paraskeva C. Schofield K. Coutts J. Fleetwood A. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); syndecan-2, sense, 5′-GGGAGCTGATGAGGATGTAG-3′, antisense, 5′-CACTGGATGGTT-TGCGTTCT-3′ (394-bp fragment, 60 °C); syndecan-4, sense, 5′-CTCCTAGAAGGCCGATACTTCT-3′, antisense, 5′-GGACCTCCGTTCTCT-CAAAGAT-3′ (345-bp fragment, 60 °C); glypican, sense, 5′-ATCACCGACAAGTTCTGGGGTA-3′, antisense, 5′-CATCTTCTCACTGCACA-GTGTC-3′ (317-bp fragment, 60 °C) (18Dobra K. Andang M. Syrokou A. Karamanos N.K. Hjerpe A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative analysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was co-amplified: sense, 5′-TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAA-3′, antisense, 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′ (238-bp fragment, 60–65 °C) (19Debey S. Meyer-Kirchrath J. Schror K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Conditions for PCR after reverse transcription were: 95 °C for 1 min, specific annealing temperature for 1 min, 72 °C for 2.5 min, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 15 min. DNA Synthesis—SMCs (7,500–8,750 cells/cm2) were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h with a change of medium 24 h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated by the addition of thrombin (10 nmol/liter) or bFGF (1 ng/ml). [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added 16–18 h after stimulation. After 26–28 h, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed in trichloroacetic acid, and DNA was solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Boyden Chamber Migration Assay and Cell Spreading—Modified Boyden chamber assays were performed for 5 h at 37 °C with 48-well microchemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe) and polycarbonate filters (10-μm pores; Nucleopore Corp.) coated with monomeric collagen (100 μg/ml Vitrogen 100 in 0.1 mol/liter acetic acid, Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA), as described (15Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells (20,000/well) were added to the upper chamber, and chemoattractants or serum-free medium were added to the lower chamber. Migration was measured as the number of cells/high power field (×100) that had migrated across the membrane. Assays were performed in quadruplicate. For cell spreading experiments, cells were seeded on glass slides coated with monomeric collagen (100 μg/ml Vitrogen 100 in 0.1 mol/liter acetic acid) and allowed to spread for up to 6 h in serum-free medium. Cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick staining solution (Baxter, Detroit, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—All experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate, triplicate, or quadruplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test or by a paired two-tailed t test as indicated. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Inhibition of Syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 Expression by siRNA in Human Vascular SMCs—Specific siRNA significantly reduced RNA levels for syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 in human SMCs, respectively, but had no effect on RNA of syndecan-2 or glypican, two proteoglycans that can both bind bFGF (5Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). RNA oligonucleotides with a scrambled sequence derived from syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA had no effect on RNA levels (Fig. 1). Syndecan-4 protein levels were determined in extracts from human aortic SMCs by Western blotting. Although the specific siRNA inhibited syndecan-4 protein expression by over 90%, a matched scrambled RNA oligonucleotide had no effect on syndecan-4 expression (Fig. 2A). To determine whether other HSPGs in the cell layer were affected by syndecan-4 siRNA, an antibody (anti-ΔHS, clone 3G10) that detects an HSPG neo-epitope after heparitinase digestion was used on Western blots of SMC lysates prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2B). Multiple bands, similar to those described by others using this antibody (20Chu C.L. Buczek-Thomas J.A. Nugent M.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), were detected. A double band of 35–37 kDa, presumably syndecan-4 core protein, was strongly reduced in cells treated with syndecan-4 siRNA. These data indicate that whereas other HSPGs are present, only syndecan-4 is altered by siRNA to syndecan-4. An effective siRNA was also generated to inhibit FGFR-1, as determined in immunoprecipitates from SMC lysates (Fig. 2C). Cell Spreading Is Impaired in SMCs with Reduced Syndecan-4 Expression—Because syndecan-4 is involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton (9Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Thodeti C.K. Albrechtsen R. Grauslund M. Asmar M. Larsson C. Takada Y. Mercurio A.M. Couchman J.R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9576-9584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we investigated whether syndecan-4 siRNA affects cell spreading. When compared with controls, syndecan-4 siRNA-treated cells spread less at 1 and 3 h in serum-free medium. However, by 6 h, all cells were equally spread on collagen (Fig. 3). Cell spreading in 15% serum appeared to be normal, and also, the number of cells that attached in 15% serum overnight was not decreased in syndecan-4 siRNA cells (Fig. 3B) when compared with control cells. These data suggest that the lack of syndecan-4 delays cell spreading on collagen. Delayed spreading was not observed in cells with decreased FGFR-1 expression, indicating distinct functions of syndecan-4 and FGFR-1. Syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 Are Required for Thrombin- and bFGF-induced Migration—In Boyden chamber assays, thrombin- or bFGF-induced migration of SMCs transfected with syndecan-4 siRNA was impaired when compared with the migration of scrambled RNA-treated control cells (Fig. 4A). In contrast, serum-induced migration was not affected by syndecan-4 siRNA. SMCs transfected with FGFR-1 siRNA also migrated less toward thrombin than control cells, and unlike control cells, bFGF-neutralizing antibodies had no inhibitory effect on thrombin-induced migration (Fig. 4B). The migration pattern of untreated SMCs was not different from control cells treated with scrambled RNA matched for either syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA (data not shown). Syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 Are Required for Thrombin-induced bFGF-dependent DNA Synthesis—SMCs transfected with syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 siRNA or with matched scrambled RNA were stimulated with thrombin or bFGF. In cells treated with syndecan-4 siRNA, DNA synthesis in response to thrombin or bFGF was reduced (Fig. 5A). A bFGF-neutralizing antibody inhibited thrombin-induced DNA synthesis in control cells but had no inhibitory effect when syndecan-4 expression was reduced by siRNA. Also of interest, inhibition of thrombin-induced DNA synthesis by heparin was only significant in control cells. A nonspecific IgG had no effect in either experimental group (Fig. 5A). The effects of reduced FGFR-1 expression were similar to those observed with reduced syndecan-4 expression. Thrombin-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited in cells with reduced FGFR-1 expression, and bFGF-neutralizing antibodies exerted no further inhibitory effect (Fig. 5B). Heparin significantly inhibited DNA synthesis only in control cells. In contrast to control cells, stimulation with recombinant bFGF of cells treated with FGFR-1 siRNA did not result in increased DNA synthesis. Late Phase of Thrombin-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation Requires Syndecan-4 and FGFR-1—To determine whether ERK 1/2 is involved in syndecan-4- and FGFR-1-controlled intracellular pathways that are activated by thrombin, non-treated SMCs and SMCs transfected with scrambled RNA, syndecan-4 siRNA, or FGFR-1 siRNA were stimulated with thrombin from 5 min to 4 h. The extent of ERK phosphorylation at 5 min in control cells and siRNA cells was the same, whereas at later time points, it was reduced in SMCs transfected with either syndecan-4 siRNA (Fig. 6A) or FGFR-1 siRNA (Fig. 6B). In previous studies, we and others have shown that thrombin-induced mitogenesis and migration require the activation of a secondary ligand-receptor system (15Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). In rat SMCs, thrombin transactivates the EGF receptor by releasing heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) from the cell surface (15Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, we recently demonstrated that in human SMCs, thrombin does not transactivate the EGF receptor. Instead, thrombin causes rapid release of bFGF into the pericellular matrix with subsequent FGFR-1 phosphorylation, which can be blocked by bFGF-neutralizing antibodies and by heparin (3Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 is required for thrombin-induced mitogenesis and migration by using syndecan-4 siRNA to specifically decrease syndecan-4 core protein (Fig. 2B). We found that human SMCs with reduced syndecan-4 or FGFR-1 migrate and proliferate less in response to thrombin or bFGF (Figs. 4 and 5). The magnitude of this effect is similar to the level of inhibition of thrombin-mediated mitogenesis obtained by treating normal cells with bFGF-neutralizing antibodies (3Rauch B.H. Millette E. Kenagy R.D. Daum G. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, the bFGF-neutralizing antibody did not alter thrombin- or bFGF-mediated migration and proliferation of FGFR-1 knockdown SMCs. These data indicate that the thrombin-induced bFGF-dependent pathway is mediated by both syndecan-4 and FGFR-1. Syndecan-4, as well as syndecan-1 and -2 and glypicans, can bind bFGF and increase bFGF-FGFR-1 interactions (5Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In addition, syndecan-4 is known to play a unique role in bFGF-dependent signal transduction (9Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Volk R. Schwartz J.J. Li J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4 forms a complex with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and PKCα, which promotes PKCα activation (6Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 7Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25548-25551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a serine/threonine protein phosphatase becomes activated after bFGF binds to its tyrosine kinase receptor. This phosphatase dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic tail of syndecan-4, increasing its affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and promoting dimerization (and possibly higher order multimers) of the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic tail. This in turn increases the binding and activation of PKCα (24Horowitz A. Tkachenko E. Simons M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is known that thrombin-induced signaling involves activation of PKC isoforms and translocation of PKCα into focal domains (25Maasch C. Wagner S. Lindschau C. Alexander G. Buchner K. Gollasch M. Luft F.C. Haller H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, since syndecan-4 activates PKCα (6Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8133-8136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 7Oh E.S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11805-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25548-25551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it is possible that thrombin may exert its effects on migration and proliferation, in part, via promoting bFGF and syndecan-4 dependent PKCα activation. Thrombin also induces signal transduction through the MAPK pathway, and prolonged ERK activation is required for cell cycle progression induced by various mitogens, including thrombin (26Vouret-Craviari V. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Scimeca J.C. Van Obberghen E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In rat SMCs, the EGF receptor co-stimulatory pathway was required to sustain ERK activity beyond 30 min (15Kalmes A. Vesti B.R. Daum G. Abraham J.A. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In human SMCs, we found that this sustained activation of ERK by thrombin required syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 (Fig. 6), in part explaining the role of syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 in thrombin-mediated SMC proliferation (Fig. 5). It would be of interest to further investigate the mechanisms involved in syndecan-4 dependent bFGF-mediated ERK activation. Our observation of impaired spreading of syndecan-4 siRNA cells on collagen-coated slides (Fig. 3) is in agreement with previous reports that syndecan-4 is involved in cell spreading through the assembly of focal contacts (9Longley R.L. Woods A. Fleetwood A. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3421-3431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This may explain the reduced migration of these SMCs (Fig. 4). Although we did not directly investigate focal adhesion formation, the observation that syndecan-deficient cells were fully spread by 6 h suggests that human SMCs have sufficient compensatory mechanisms to form focal adhesions. This is consistent with observations using fibroblasts from syndecan-4-deficient animals. Although these cells are able to form normal focal adhesions (13Bass M.D. Humphries M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Tsuzuki S. Nakamura E. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5249-5252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), focal adhesion formation is impaired when the cells are cultured on the cell binding fragment of fibronectin in the presence of culture medium with the heparin-binding fragment of fibronectin (27Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Tsuzuki S. Nakamura E. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5249-5252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Of interest, these syndecan-4-deficient mice develop normally, but when challenged, they exhibit impaired wound healing and decreased angiogenesis in the granulation tissue (28Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 29Wilcox-Adelman S.A. Denhez F. Iwabuchi T. Saoncella S. Calautti E. Goetinck P.F. Glycoconj. J. 2002; 19: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific role of syndecan-4 for focal adhesion formation, especially in human cells, is uncertain and requires further study. In summary, we demonstrate a requirement for syndecan-4 and FGFR-1 for thrombin-induced bFGF-dependent migration, mitogenesis, and sustained ERK activation in human vascular SMCs. We are grateful to Dr. Michael A. Reidy (University of Washington) for providing the bFGF neutralizing antibody."

https://openalex.org/W2156826231,"Chronic alcohol consumption depletes hepatic vitamin A stores. However, vitamin A supplementation is hepatotoxic, which is further potentiated by concomitant alcohol consumption. It was suggested that polar retinol metabolites generated by alcohol-inducible cytochrome P4502E1 aggravate liver damage. However, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. To elucidate the effects of polar retinol metabolites on cultured HepG2 cells and primary rat hepatocytes, polar retinol metabolites were extracted from liver tissues of rats fed either an alcoholic or isocaloric control Lieber-DeCarli diet. Cell toxicity assays included morphology assessment, trypan blue exclusion test, and LDH/AST leakage. Staining for DAPI and acridine orange, FACS analysis, and Western blot for cleaved caspase-9 and -3 were used to detect apoptosis. Polar retinol metabolites caused marked cytotoxicity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in both cell types reflected by morphological changes, a dramatic increase in trypan blue positive cells, and LDH/AST leakage. Toxicity was due to apoptosis, as demonstrated by a time-dependent increase of sub-G1 cellular events, a rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a time-dependent activation of caspase-9 and -3. No toxicity was found with equivalent doses of the control extract from nonalcoholic rats. We demonstrate that polar retinol metabolites cause marked hepatocyte death through the induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2027512745,"Adenosine kinase (ADK), a key enzyme in the regulation of the intracellular level of adenosine is also speculated to be responsible for the conversion of cytokinin ribosides to their respective nucleotides. To elucidate the role of ADK in the cytokinin metabolism of tobacco BY-2 cells (Nicotiana tabacum cv. “Bright Yellow-2”; TBY-2), we have identified and characterized the full-length cDNAs encoding four ADK isoforms of N. tabacum and determined their catalytic properties. The four TBY-2 ADK isoforms (designated 1S, 2S, 1T, and 2T) display a high affinity for both adenosine (Km 1.88–7.30 μm) and three distinct types of cytokinin ribosides: isopentenyladenosine; zeatin riboside; and dihydrozeatin riboside (Km 0.30–8.71 μm). The Vmax/Km values suggest that ADK2S exhibits in vitro an overall higher efficiency in the metabolism of cytokinin ribosides than the other three isoforms. The expression pattern of NtADK genes is modulated significantly during the cell cycle. We suggest that the increased transcript accumulation of NtADK coupled to an increased ADK activity just prior to mitosis is associated with a very active cytokinin metabolism at that phase of the cell cycle of synchronized TBY-2 cells. Adenosine kinase (ADK), a key enzyme in the regulation of the intracellular level of adenosine is also speculated to be responsible for the conversion of cytokinin ribosides to their respective nucleotides.

Cytokinins play an essential role in almost all aspects of plant growth and development including cell division, shoot initiation and growth, leaf senescence, and photomorphogenesis (1Mok M.C.

Plant Hormones, Physiology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar). Active cytokinins contain an adenine moiety substituted at N6 with an isoprene derivative or an aromatic ring. Their pool is controlled in plants by the rate of import, biosynthesis, inactivation, and degradation (3Mok D.W.S. Martin R.C. Mok D.W.S. Mok M.C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity, and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 129-137Google Scholar). One of the major steps in cytokinin metabolism is the conversion of free bases and ribosides to nucleotides. The latter is proposed to be one of the inactive forms of cytokinins (4Kaminek M. Trends Biotechnol. 1992; 10: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Jameson P.E. Mok D.W.S.

It has been reported that external application of cytokinin bases and ribosides is associated with rapid formation of the corresponding nucleotides (11McGaw B.A. Burch L.R. Davies P.J.

Therefore, it seems probable that phosphorylation is one of the metabolic pathways that plants use to preserve the optimally balanced levels of active cytokinins, essential for normal growth and development. This mechanism by which plants modulate the amount of various forms of cytokinins is proposed to involve adenosine kinase (ADK, 1The abbreviations used are: ADK, adenosine kinase; Ado, adenosine; iP, isopentenyladenine; iPA, isopentenyladenosine; iPMP, isopentenyladenosine monophosphate; Z, zeatin; ZR, zeatin riboside; ZMP, zeatin riboside monophosphate; DZ, dihydrozeatin; TBY-2, tobacco “Bright Yellow-2”; AFLP, amplified fragment-length polymorphism; RNAi, RNA interference. 1The abbreviations used are: ADK, adenosine kinase; Ado, adenosine; iP, isopentenyladenine; iPA, isopentenyladenosine; iPMP, isopentenyladenosine monophosphate; Z, zeatin; ZR, zeatin riboside; ZMP, zeatin riboside monophosphate; DZ, dihydrozeatin; TBY-2, tobacco “Bright Yellow-2”; AFLP, amplified fragment-length polymorphism; RNAi, RNA interference.

Strnad M. Van Onckelen H. Witters E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) isolated a 40-kDa protein from tobacco BY-2 (TBY-2, Nicotiana tabacum cv. “Bright Yellow-2”) cell extract further identified by mass spectrometry as a putative ADK. The cytokinin autonomous and highly synchronizable TBY-2 cell suspension culture (21Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar) is an excellent tool for the investigation of the cell cycle events. Examinations of endogenous cytokinins fluctuations during the cell cycle published by our group (22Redig P. Shaul O. Inze D. Van Montagu M. Van Onckelen H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) revealed transient accumulation of particularly zeatin-type cytokinins at the end of S phase, during G2-M transition, and during G1 phase.

In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of full-length cDNAs encoding four ADK isoforms of N. tabacum. The catalytic properties of tobacco ADKs and the kinetics of the ADK activity during the cell cycle progression of TBY-2 cells point to an active participation of ADK in the cytokinin metabolism. To our knowledge, this is the first report that links ADK with tobacco BY-2 cell division. Plant Materials—Nicotiana sylvestris, Nicotiana tomentosiformis (seeds kindly provided by R. M. Maier, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, Germany), and N. tabacum seeds were sown in Petri dishes on solidified Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 20 g/liter sucrose. The seedlings were cultivated in a growth chamber at 24 °C with 8-h dark/16-h light cycles. Cell Culture Maintenance and Synchronization—BY-2 cells were maintained and synchronized as described by Nagata et al. (21Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The stationary culture was transferred in a proportion of 1:10 to the fresh medium (Murashige and Skoog medium, 30 g/liter sucrose, 200 mg/liter KH2PO4, 1 mg/liter thiamine, and 0.2 mg/liter 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) containing 5 mg/liter aphidicolin (ICN Biomedicals, Asse, Belgium). The culture was agitated on a rotatory shaker at 27 °C and 130 rpm in the dark. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were extensively washed with medium and then resuspended in fresh medium. Cells were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid solution (3:1, v/v) and stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml). The mitotic index was determined by scoring the nuclei in mitosis under fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Library Screening—To increase the probability of isolation of all cDNAs for ADK, two available tobacco BY-2 cDNA libraries were screened, one representing genes expressed in exponential phase and a second one with genes expressed after methyl jasmonate treatment. 2R. Vanderhaegen and A. Goossens, unpublished data. Both libraries were screened by hybridization to a 32P-labeled 335-bp probe (Rediprime™II, Amersham Biosciences, and Bio-Spin chromatography columns, Bio-Rad, Nazareth Eke, Belgium) obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with Titan One Tube reverse transcription-PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Vilvoorde, Belgium) using total RNA from tobacco leaf and primers Adk335F/R (Table I), the sequence of which was derived from a tomato EST data base (TMECD65TV; Solanaceae Genomics Network).

Deduced amino acid sequences of TBY-2 ADK isoforms and other reported species were aligned with each other using ClustalW, version 1.84 (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54887) Google Scholar). The tree was constructed on conserved positions of the alignment with the neighbor-joining algorithm as implemented in TREECON (29Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl.

GenBank™ accession numbers of ADK proteins were, respectively, as follows: Arabidopsis thaliana (ADK1), AAG45248; A. thaliana (ADK2), AAG45249; Cricetulus griseus, P55262; Danio rerio, AAH51621.1; Homo sapiens, U33936.1; Mus musculus, P55264; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, P83734; Oryza sativa, BAC02723; Physcomitrella patens, Y15430.1; Rattus norvegicus, AAB03110.1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P47143; and Zea mays, AJ012281.1. Overexpression and Isolation of Recombinant Proteins—The coding region of NtADK1-tom, NtADK2-tom, and NtADK2-syl was amplified with the primers NdeIadk1tF/BamHIadk1tR, NdeIadk2tF/BamHIadk2R, and NdeIadk2sF/BamHIadk2R (Table I) and digested subsequently with NdeI and BamHI. Excised fragments were cloned into pET15b (Novagen, Leuven, Belgium), and the recombinant plasmids designated as pEHisadk-1t, pEHisadk-2s, and pEHisadk-2t were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for protein expression. The coding region of NtADK1-syl was amplified with primers XhoIadk1sF/HindIIIadk1sR, cloned into pCR4-TOPO according to the kit manual (TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing, Invitrogen), and released with XhoI and HindIII. The excised fragment was subsequently ligated with the XhoI/HindIII-restricted pBAD/His B (pBHisadk1s). The TOP10 strain was used for both cloning and expression (Invitrogen). The sequence of the cloned constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Electroporation of host cells was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECM 399, BTX, San Diego, CA). Transformed bacteria were grown at 37 °C until the culture reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. To induce expression, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a concentration of 1 mm (pEHisadk-1t, pEHisadk-2s, and pEHisadk-2t) or l-arabinose was added at a concentration of 0.02% (pBHisadk1s) and incubation was continued with shaking for an additional 4 h. Recombinant proteins were recovered on a nickel column according to the His Bind purification kit protocol (Novagen). Isolation of Recombinant Proteins and Activity Assays—Protein extracts were concentrated on Vivaspin 4 centrifugal concentrators (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany) and subsequently dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Enzyme activity was determined in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2), 1 mm MgCl2,4mm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 30 mm NaF, 25 ng of purified protein, and 0.25–4.0 μm appropriate radiolabeled nucleoside substrate ([2,8-3H]adenosine (Sigma, Bornem, Belgium), N6-isopentenyl[2-3H]adenosine, trans-[2-3H]zeatin riboside, and [3H]dihydrozeatin riboside (all three from Olchemim, Olomouc, Czech Republic)) diluted with unlabeled nucleosides if necessary to obtain high enough substrate concentration. For assays of ADK activity during cell cycle progression of TBY-2, we used 10 μg of the total protein from each time point and 20 μm [2.8-3H]Ado (5.15 mCi mmol–1). Additionally, 2.5 μmerythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (an inhibitor of Ado deaminase) was included (Sigma). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.25 m EDTA. The radiolabeled nucleotides formed during the reaction were separated from nucleosides on Supelclean LC-NH2 SPE Tubes (Supelco, Bellfonte, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were loaded on columns equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Subsequently, columns were washed with 12 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Negatively charged nucleotides were eluted with 2 volumes of 2.5 m NaCl and quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Tri-Carb 1500 scintillation analyzer, Packard BioScience, Zellik, Belgium). The values of Km and Vmax were calculated by a non-linear regression with the aid of the program Hyper 1.1 (copyright J. S. Easterby). 3Available at homepage.ntlworld.com/john.easterby/software.html. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—One milliliter of each transformed bacteria culture was centrifuged (10 min at 14,000 × g), and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of BugBuster containing 2.5 units of Benzonase (His Bind resin and buffer kit). SDS-PAGE was performed in a 12% (w/v) separation gel and 5% (w/v) stacking gel. Separated proteins were silver-stained according to Sambrook and Russell (34Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). In parallel, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using an electroblotting device (Novex, Invitrogen). The protein blot was probed according to the manufacturer's protocol with monoclonal antibodies against (His)6 along with a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG AP conjugate (Novagen). RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Expression Analysis—Total RNA from plant material was isolated with the RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Huntington, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For the expression study, total RNA was extracted from TBY-2 cell culture samples collected at 11 time points during the cell cycle using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Ambion). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) with oligo(dT)18 as primer. Primers used in transcript abundance analysis amplified fragments of 942 bp of NtADK1 (Tor1F/Tor1R), 527 bp of NtADK2 (Tor2F/Tor2R), and 602 bp of ACTIN (ActinNt2F/ActinNt2R). The single PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% Tris borate-EDTA-agarose gel and stained with SYBR Green. The relative abundance of generated fragments was quantified using a fluorescence imaging device (Typhoon 9400, Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant imaging software (Amersham Biosciences). Cytokinin Measurements—Frozen cell samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted overnight at –20 °C in Bieleski buffer (32Bieleski R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 121: 431-442Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Deuterated standards were added to the extracts as internal tracers. Cytokinins were purified on a combination of DEAE-Sephadex and RP-C18 cartridges. The purified extracts were loaded onto immunoaffinity columns containing monoclonal antibodies against cytokinins. After immunoaffinity purification, the cytokinins were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography linked to Quattro II mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface (33Prinsen E. Redig P Van Dongen W. Esmans E. Van Onckelen H.A. Rapid Comm. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 948-953Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The chromatograms obtained were processed by means of Masslynx software (Waters, Zellik, Belgium), and the cytokinin concentrations were determined according to the principle of isotope dilution. The Tobacco BY-2 Cell Line Harbors Four ADK Isoforms That Were Inherited from Its Ancestors in a Pairwise Manner— Two TBY-2 cDNA libraries were screened with a 335-bp probe for putative ADK generated with primers whose sequence was derived from a tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) EST data base (see “Experimental Procedures”). 23 clones were isolated and upon sequencing were found to correspond to four distinct cDNAs. BlastX comparison (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.H. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58746) Google Scholar) of the determined nucleotide sequences against the NCBI non-redundant protein data base revealed a striking homology to ADK genes. Thus, the isolated cDNAs were designated as NtADKs. Furthermore, cDNA clones exhibited a two-by-two high sequence similarity. Nucleotide comparisons for each pair revealed identities of 95–96%. N. tabacum is a natural allotetraploid derived from ancestors of Nicotiana sylvestris (the maternal S genome donor) and Nicotiana tomentosiformis (the paternal T genome donor) (35Okamuro J.K. Goldberg R.B. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 1985; 198: 290-298Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Hedtke B. Legen J. Weihe A. Herrmann R.G. Borner T. Plant J. 2002; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Hence, we presumed that the two pairs of N. tabacum homologues represent orthologous genes. Those two pairs were initially designated NtADK1 and NtADK2. To verify this presumption, we designed primer pairs Tor1F/R and Tor2F/R (Table I), annealing solely to identical regions within either pair of homologues. Amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA isolated, respectively, from N. tomentosiformis leaf or N. sylvestris leaf with both primer pairs yielded four single amplification products of lengths consistent with those anticipated from the nucleotide sequences of the NtADK clones (942 bp of both NtADK1 clones amplified with Tor1F/R; 527 bp of both NtADK2 clones amplified with Tor2F/R). Subsequent sequencing and nucleotide sequence alignment revealed 99–100% identity between the individual PCR fragments and the NtADK clones and resulted in their assignment to NtADK-syl or to NtADK-tom (Fig. 1A, only partial alignment is presented). The largest open reading frame of each clone begins with an AUG codon and ends with a TAA codon (NtADK1) or a TGA codon (NtADK2). Sequence analysis of tom-type NtADK clones revealed short (Sh) and long (Lg) transcript variants (1310 and 1422 bp of NtADK1-tom and 1258 and 1305 bp of NtADK2-tom) (Fig. 1B). The lengths of NtADK1-syl and NtADK2-syl were 1377 and 1307 bp, respectively. The open reading frame of each clone contained 340 codons. For the purpose of discussion, the putative TBY-2 ADK isoforms have been designated as 1T, 1S, 2T, and 2S, respectively. 4The amino acid sequence of the proteins encoded by the clones can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under NCBI accession numbers AAU14830, AAU14831, AAU14832, AAU14833, AAU14834, and AAU14835. The alignment over the full length of the predicted polypeptides is presented in Fig. 1C. The deduced amino acid sequences display an identity of 97% between the orthologous S- and T-type ADKs and an identity with ADKs reported of other species varying between 19–25% (M. tuberculosis) and 83–86% (A. thaliana). The assignment of four ADK isoforms to two groups designated ADK1 and ADK2 should not be related to classification of the two previously identified ADK isoforms of A. thaliana. The phylogenetic analysis of the ADK protein family ensues higher sequence similarity between TBY-2 ADK1 and ADK2 orthologues than between their respective homologues from Arabidopsis (Fig. 2). This led us to the conclusion that two independent gene duplications have occurred after the divergence of those species. Therefore, it can be postulated that the original ancestral ADK genes existing in Arabidopsis and tobacco were true orthologues sharing the same functions and that later both genes were duplicated after which duplicates may have acquired altered functions. The tree topology also proves that the emergence of N. tabacum (fusion of the two tobacco genomes) occurred after the gene duplication event. Pepstats software (available on EMBL-EBI server) was used for amino acid sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of the proteins encoded by the NtADK clones predicted a pI of 4.8–4.9 and an almost identical molecular mass of ∼37.5 kDa. The predicted molecular mass falls within the mass range of ADKs characterized from other species (14Moffatt B.A. Wang L. Allen M.S. Stevens Y.Y. Qin W. Snider J. von Schwartzenberg K. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1775-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Schomberg D. Stephan D. Schomberg D. Stephan D. Enzyme Handbook. 13. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1997: 1-9Google Scholar) and is in agreement with the molecular weight of the putative tobacco ADK isolated by Laukens et al. (20Laukens K. Lenobel R. Strnad M. Van Onckelen H. Witters E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The NtADK mRNA Level Is Modulated Significantly during the Cell Cycle—To investigate the accumulation of NtADK gene transcripts and ADK activity during the cell cycle, a TBY-2 cell suspension culture was synchronized by application of aphidicolin (21Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Samples were taken immediately before (0 h) and every hour after aphidicolin removal (1–10 h). A peak of ∼50% in the mitotic index was observed ∼7 h after cells were released from aphidicolin block (Fig. 3B). In expression studies, it is often difficult to distinguish homologous transcripts of duplicated genes that usually have the same length and similar or almost identical sequences. None of the known methods for investigation of gene expression in polyploidy (38Cronn R.C. Adams K.L. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) could be successfully applied for all of the NtADK genes. Due to the high degree of sequence similarity, it was impossible to specifically amplify and visualize individual transcripts. Thus, we used the primers designed previously for determining the origin of the NtADK clones. As a consequence, PCR products reflected the combined expression level of two orthologues. The expression of NtADK1 (-syl and -tom type) and NtADK2 (-syl and -tom type) at the transcript level in the synchronized TBY-2 suspension-cultured cells was analyzed using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ACTIN normalization (Fig. 3A). The levels of the NtADK1 and the NtADK2 orthologue transcripts showed a transient accumulation reaching a maximum of 5–6 h after aphidicolin release corresponding to the onset of mitosis. The transient nature of the expression of the NtADK2 orthologues appears more acute than that of the NtADK1 orthologues. This result was confirmed by a second independently performed synchronization experiment. TBY-2 ADK Activity Peak Corresponds with the Maximum in Mitotic Activity—To verify that the NtADK clones encode proteins possessing ADK activity, the coding region of each clone was expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag from either pET15b or pBAD/His vector in E. coli. Recombinant ADKs were subsequently purified on Ni2+-charged columns and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. 4, A and B). The observed migration pattern corresponds well with the predicted molecular mass of recombinant protein (∼40 kDa). For kinetic analysis, activity was measured by monitoring the formation of nucleotides from radiolabeled nucleoside substrates. The reaction conditions used (pH 7.2 and ATP:MgCl2 molar ratio 4:1) were previously found to be within an optimal range for other plant ADKs (12Chen C.M. Eckert R.L.

The Km and Vmax/Km of TBY-2 ADK isoforms were determined for four substrates: Ado; isopentenyladenosine (iPA); zeatin riboside (ZR); and dihydrozeatin riboside (Table II). As indicated by their Km values, the four ADK isoforms display similar affinities for Ado and the three different types of cytokinins with the exception of ADK1T, which displays sig"
https://openalex.org/W2166972165,"We have identified in Xanthomonas campestris a novel N-acetylornithine transcarbamylase that replaces ornithine transcarbamylase in the canonic arginine biosynthetic pathway of several Eubacteria. The crystal structures of the protein in the presence and absence of the reaction product, N-acetylcitrulline, were determined. This new family of transcarbamylases lacks the DxxSMG motif that is characteristic of all ornithine transcarbamylases (OTCases) and contains a novel proline-rich loop that forms part of the active site. The specificity for N-acetylornithine is conferred by hydrogen bonding with residues in the proline-rich loop via water molecules and by hydrophobic interactions with residues from the adjacent 80's, 120's, and proline-rich loops. This novel protein structure provides a starting point for rational design of specific analogs that may be useful in combating human and plant pathogens that utilize acetylornithine transcarbamylase rather than ornithine transcarbamylase."

Heparin is an antiproliferative agent for VSMCs and has been shown to block VSMC proliferation both in tissue culture systems and in animals. Despite the well documented antiproliferative actions of heparin, its cellular targets largely remain unknown. In an effort to characterize the mechanism of the antiproliferative property of heparin, we have analyzed the effect of heparin on cell cycle in VSMC. Our results indicate that the heparin-induced block in G1 to S phase transition is imposed by p27kip1-mediated inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity. Further analysis of p27kip1 mRNA levels showed that the increase in p27kip1 protein levels in heparin-treated VSMC occurs at posttranscriptional levels. We present evidence that heparin causes stabilization of p27kip1 protein during G1 phase and thereby prevents activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2.

In an effort to characterize the mechanism of the antiproliferative property of heparin, we have analyzed the effect of heparin on cell cycle in VSMC. Our results indicate that the heparin-induced block in G1 to S phase transition is imposed by p27kip1-mediated inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity. Further analysis of p27kip1 mRNA levels showed that the increase in p27kip1 protein levels in heparin-treated VSMC occurs at posttranscriptional levels. We present evidence that heparin causes stabilization of p27kip1 protein during G1 phase and thereby prevents activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2.

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6840) Google Scholar). In a normal artery, the VSMCs are in a non-proliferative quiescent state and show a well differentiated contractile phenotype. After the vascular injury, there is a loss of differentiated phenotype and a shift to a synthetic phenotype, which is also accompanied by entry into the cell cycle and proliferation (2Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9909) Google Scholar). Several cytokines, growth factors, vasoregulatory molecules, and extracellular matrix components exert their effects on the proliferation of VSMC. The development of an atherosclerotic lesion can be blocked significantly by effective inhibition of VSMC proliferation (3Boehm M. Nabel E.G. Prog. Cell. Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar). Natural glycosaminoglycans such as heparin are also known inhibit VSMC proliferation in vitro in tissue culture (4Castellot J Jr J. Addonizio M.L. Rosenberg R. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 5Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Int. Angiol. 1987; 6: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar, 6Clowes A.W. Clowes M.M. Transplant. Proc. 1989; 21: 3700-3701PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo in animal models (7Kleiman N.S. Weitz J.I. Campbell G.R. Campbell J.H. Woods T.C. Blystone C.R. Yoo J. Edelman E.R.

Invasive Cardiol. 2000; 12 (discussion E25–18): E14-E18PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the well documented antiproliferative effect of heparin on VSMC, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inhibition of cell cycle remain uncharacterized. Cellular proliferation is regulated primarily by regulation of the cell cycle (9Pardee A.B. Dubrow R. Hamlin J.L. Kletzien R.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 715-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), which consists of four distinct sequential phases (G0/G1, S, G2, and M). This tightly regulated temporal order is controlled by the sequential activation of certain serine/threonine protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) that phosphorylate the Rb protein (10Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, Rb exists in its hypophosphorylated state and is thus able to bind and sequester the members of E2F family of transcription factors (11Kouzarides T. Trends. Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 211-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rb at multiple sites by Cdks causes the release of E2F because hyperphosphorylated Rb cannot bind and sequester E2F factors, thus enabling them to activate transcription of genes whose products are absolutely essential for further cell cycle progression (12Olashaw N. Pledger W.J. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2002/53/RE7)PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of Cdks is further regulated negatively by a number of Cdk inhibitors, which are grouped into two classes (13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). The members of the INK4 family (p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and p19INK4d) inhibit only Cdk4 and Cdk6 (14Ortega S. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 73-87PubMed Google Scholar), and the members of Cip family (p21cip1, p27kip1, and p57kip1) inhibit all Cdks (15Coqueret O. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 65-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It is unknown how heparin affects the activities of these proteins to regulate the cell cycle. We have shown recently that heparin induces a block in G1 to S phase transition in VSMC (16Patel R.C. Handy I. Patel C.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The interferon-induced protein kinase (PKR) activation in heparin-treated VSMC was essential in part for this cell cycle block. In this paper, we have extended our study to determine the mechanism of heparin-induced cell cycle block. Our results indicate that heparin causes the p27kip1 levels to remain elevated even in response to serum, thereby causing an inhibition of Cdk2 activity that results in deficient phosphorylation of Rb, leading to the block in S phase entry. Furthermore, the elevated levels of p27kip1 in heparin-treated cells were found to result from a posttranscriptional mechanism, mainly by stabilization of p27kip1 protein. This p27kip1 stabilization was found to be defective in cells treated with 2-aminopurine, an inhibitor of PKR activity. In addition, the p27kip1-null cells were found to be insensitive to heparin-induced cell cycle block, thereby demonstrating p27kip1 stabilization to be the main cause of the antiproliferative effects of heparin. Cell Culture—The rat primary aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were obtained from the thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RASMCs were made quiescent in DMEM with 0.1% FCS for 72–96 h. For heparin treatment, the cells were shifted to 0.1% serum containing medium with 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma, catalog number H-3149, lot 17H03885) for 2 h. After 2 h, the cells were serum-stimulated with DMEM containing 10% serum and 100 μg/ml heparin. As a control, RASMCs were subjected to identical treatment in the absence of heparin. Western Blot Analysis—The RASMCs grown in 100-mm plates were treated with heparin as indicated in the previous section for different lengths of time. Cell extracts were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Triton X-100, 40% glycerol, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium molybdate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. 100 μg of total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using the ECL plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions and following specific antibodies: cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-753, 1:1000); cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-481, 1:1000); cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-751, 1:1000); p21 (BD Biosciences, 65951A, 1:1000); Rb (BD Biosciences, 14001A, 1:1000); α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma, A2547 clone 1A4, 1:1000); and p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1641, 1:1000). Cdk2 Kinase Assays—Cell extracts were prepared from RASMCs treated with heparin as described in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged in cold temperature for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. Cell extracts containing 100 μg of the total protein were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h under constant rotation in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 250 ng of anti-Cdk2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then suspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of histone H1 (Sigma), 10 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and then stopped by the addition of 10 μlof4× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and boiling for 10 min. The proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging analysis of dried gels. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from RASMC was extracted by using the RNAzol B reagent (TelTest). 30 mg of total RNA from each sample was analyzed by Northern blot analysis according to Church and Gilbert protocol with a 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment of human p27kip1 cDNA (provided kindly by Sylvain Meloche, University of Montreal, Canada) as a probe. The signals were analyzed by phosphorimaging analysis. The same blot was then stripped and reprobed with a 28 S ribosomal RNA as a probe to ensure equal loading in all of the lanes. Cloning the p27kip1 Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) Element in the Bicistronic Vector and Assaying Its Activity in VSMC—The pLL vector is composed of a fragment containing Renilla luciferase from pRL-null (Promega) as the first cistron fused to a fragment encoding the cytosolic firefly luciferase from pGL3-basic (Promega) as the second cistron. This vector and the pLVL construct containing the IRES element from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA were kindly provided to us by Dr. Orna Elroy-Stein (Tel Aviv University). A plasmid construct containing a 502-bp long murine p27kip1 5′-UTR was kindly provided by Robin Miskimins (University of South Dakota). This 502-bp long murine p27kip1 5′-UTR was PCR-amplified and subcloned at the EcoRV site between the two luciferase reading frames in pLL to generate the M502/pLL construct. 1 μg of each of the two plasmids (pLL and M502/pLL) was transfected into rat VSMC using the Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested and cell extracts were prepared and assayed for Renilla and firefly luciferase activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Zylux luminometer. Pulse-Chase Experiment—The RASMCs were grown in 6-well plates and were made quiescent in DMEM with 0.1% FCS for 72–96 h. The cells were then treated with 100 μg/ml heparin in 0.1% serum containing methionine-free medium for 2 h. After 2 h, the cells were serum-stimulated with methionine-free DMEM containing 10% serum and 100 μg/ml heparin. As a control, RASMCs were subjected to identical treatment in the absence of heparin. 6 h after serum stimulation, the cells were pulse-labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine and chased for the times indicated in fresh medium with methionine containing 10% serum. Cell lysates prepared at indicated times were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p27kip1 monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose, and the labeled immunoprecipitated p27kip1 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography and phosphorimaging analysis. Effect of Inhibition of PKR Activity by 2-Aminopurine—RASMCs were made quiescent in DMEM with 0.1% FCS for 72–96 h. The cells were then treated with 10 mm 2-aminopurine (2AP) for 2 h prior to the addition of heparin. After this treatment, 100 μg/ml heparin was added to the cells in 0.1% serum containing medium for 2 h. After 2 h, the cells were serum-stimulated with DMEM containing 10% serum and 100 μg/ml heparin. As a control, RASMCs were subjected to identical treatment in the absence of 2AP. Cell extracts were prepared 20 h after the start of heparin treatments, and a Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-p27kip1 antibody. The blot was then stripped and reprobed with anti-α-actin antibody to ascertain that an equal amount of protein from different cell extracts was analyzed. Effect of Heparin on p27kip1-null Cells—The p27–/– and isogenic p27+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were provided by J. M. Roberts (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). The p27+/+ and p27–/– MEFs were made quiescent in 0.1% serum for 36–48 h and were stimulated with DMEM containing 10% serum. The cells were pretreated for 2 h with 100 μg/ml heparin in low serum medium before the addition of serum-containing medium with 100 μg/ml heparin. As a control, the same treatments were performed without any heparin. 24 h after serum stimulation, the cells were permeabilized using the Vindelov's solution (17Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) and stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data are representative of three separate experiments. It has been shown previously that heparin induces a block in G1 to S transition in VSMC (16Patel R.C. Handy I. Patel C.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To characterize the mechanism of this cell cycle block, we have analyzed the effect of heparin on defined cell cycle events that occur in response to serum. As a first step toward characterizing the effect of heparin on cell cycle, we performed Western blot analysis to examine the expression of cyclin D and E in the presence of heparin. Heparin showed no effect on the expression of cyclins D and E. Cyclin D was barely detectable in quiescent VSMCs and was induced within 4 h after addition of serum, both in presence and absence of heparin (Supplementary Fig. 1A, lanes 1–8). Cyclin E was detected at low levels in serum-starved quiescent VSMCs and was up-regulated by the addition of serum at 8 h, both in presence and absence of heparin (Supplementary Fig. 1B, lanes 1–12). We next examined whether the phosphorylation of Rb in response to serum was affected by the addition of heparin. In quiescent cells, most of the Rb protein was present in the faster migrating hypophosphorylated form (Supplementary Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The addition of serum showed a prominent induction of Rb phosphorylation with slower migrating phosphorylated Rb first appearing at 18 h (Supplementary Fig. 2, lane 8) and then the phosphorylated form completely prevailing at 24 and 30 h (Supplementary Fig. 2, lanes 10 and 12). However, in the presence of heparin, there was no phosphorylated form of Rb at 18 h (lane 7) with only a marginal induction at 24 and 30 h. In the presence of heparin, the phosphorylated form of Rb protein never prevailed completely, even at 24 and 30 h after serum addition, as in the absence of heparin. These results indicate that heparin prevents Rb phosphorylation in response to serum. Induction of cyclin A synthesis in response to serum occurs as cells enter S phase, and it is abruptly degraded before metaphase during mitosis (18Desdouets C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Murphy M. Brechot C. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Brown N.R. Johnson L.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 482-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The synthesis of cyclin A is mainly controlled at the transcriptional level, involving E2F and other transcription factors (20Sylvester A.M. Chen D. Krasinski K. Andres V. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activation of the G1 Cdk complexes results in the phosphorylation of the Rb protein (10Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated Rb binds to and inhibits several isoforms of the transcription factor E2F. Hyperphosphorylation of Rb in late G1 releases these E2Fs, which are responsible for up-regulating gene expression required for progression through the S, G2, and M phases (21Hatakeyama M. Weinberg R.A. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of cyclin A is regulated by phosphorylation of Rb during late G1 phase (22Knudsen K.E. Fribourg A.F. Strobeck M.W. Blanchard J.M. Knudsen E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27632-27641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We next examined whether cyclin A expression was affected by reduced Rb phosphorylation in the presence of heparin. As seen in Fig. 1A, in the absence of heparin, there was a robust induction of cyclin A at 30 h after serum addition. However, no induction of cyclin A was detected (Fig. 3B) in the presence of heparin at 30 h after the addition of serum and, at 36 h after serum addition, only a very marginal induction of cyclin A was observed. These results further indicate that inhibition of Rb phosphorylation by heparin leads to an inhibition of cyclin A induction.Fig. 3The inactive Cdk2 complexes in heparin (hep)-treated VSMCs contain the p27kip1 inhibitory protein. VSMCs were made quiescent by maintaining the confluent cultures in serum-free DMEM for 4 days. They were serum-stimulated by subculturing in 10% serum containing medium at 30% confluency. Heparin treatment was as described before in the previous figure legends. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the total amount of Cdk2 (panel A), cyclin E (panel B), and p27kip1 (panel C). To determine the association between Cdk2 and p27kip1, 500 μg of protein extracts were first immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk antibodies and then the immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-p27kip1 antibodies (panel D). Histone H1 kinase assays were performed on immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-Cdk2 antibody from 100 μg of total protein extracts (panel E). The numbers in percentages shown below panel E represent quantification of data in panel E. The data in panels C and D were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and the signal in quiescent cells was given an arbitrary value of 1 (white and vertically hatched bars). The values of total and Cdk2-bound p27kip1 protein at 18 h after serum addition in the absence (black bars) and presence of heparin (diagonally and vertically hatched bars) are expressed relative to the signal in quiescent cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether the expression of Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27kip1 was regulated by heparin. As shown in Fig. 2A, p27kip1 protein levels were rapidly down-regulated by serum and fell to undetectable levels at 24 h after the addition of serum. In contrast to this finding, p27kip1 levels were unaffected in the presence of heparin and, even at 30 h after serum addition, p27kip1 levels were comparable with those in the quiescent cells. These results indicate that the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation observed may be because of a block in Cdk activities due to high levels of p27kip1 in the presence of heparin. In contrast to p27kip1, the p21 levels showed no changes in the presence of heparin. As seen in Fig. 2B, p21 levels were induced at 6 and 12 h after serum addition before falling later at 18 h. The presence of heparin did not show any changes in this pattern, thereby indicating that p21 is not regulated by the presence of heparin. Higher levels of p27kip1 in heparin-treated VSMCs would result in reduced Cdk2 activity, thereby also affecting Rb phosphorylation (12Olashaw N. Pledger W.J. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2002/53/RE7)PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether heparin affected the Cdk2 activity by using the histone H1 phosphorylation assay. As seen in Fig. 3, there was a modest increase in the levels of cyclin E in serum-stimulated cells as compared with quiescent cells (panel B). The levels of Cdk2 (panel A) remained unchanged in quiescent and serum-stimulated VSMC. The total p27kip1 showed a decrease at 18 h after serum treatment in the absence of heparin but not in its presence (panels C and F). The Cdk2-bound p27kip1 levels dropped markedly at 18 h after serum treatment in the absence of heparin (panel D and F). However, for the heparin-treated samples, Cdk2-bound p27kip1 levels were ∼2-fold higher as compared with those in serum-starved VSMC. Consistent with this finding, the Cdk2 kinase activity assayed by histone H1 phosphorylation was high in serum-stimulated VSMC but remained low (9.7% Cdk2 activity in the absence of heparin) in VSMC treated with heparin and serum (panel E and F). A quantification of these results is shown in Fig. 3F. As seen in Fig. 3F, serum stimulation resulted in a 50% reduction in the p27kip1 protein levels in 18 h (black bar) compared with the levels in quiescent VSMC (white bar). On the other hand, heparin treatment (diagonally hatched bar) resulted in a moderate rise in p27kip1 protein levels. Serum-stimulated cells had a 50-fold less p27kip1 protein that was associated with Cdk2 compared with the quiescent cells (compare the middle bar with the vertically hatched bar). In the presence of heparin, the Cdk2-bound p27kip1 levels (horizontally hatched bar) remained high and were 2.1-fold more than the levels in the quiescent cells (vertically hatched bar). These results clearly indicate that the elevated levels of p27kip1 contribute to the inhibition of Cdk2 activity in the presence of heparin. It is known that p27kip1 protein levels are regulated primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism either at the level of translation or protein stability (23Gopfert U. Kullmann M. Hengst L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1767-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Kullmann M. Gopfert U. Siewe B. Hengst L.

Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). To examine whether the p27kip1 levels were regulated at a posttranscriptional level in VSMC, we performed Northern blot analysis of p27kip1 expression. As seen in Fig. 4A, p27kip1 mRNA levels were the highest in serum-starved cells and dropped somewhat in serum-stimulated cells, both in presence and absence of heparin to the same extent. These results indicate that heparin treatment seems to regulate p27kip1 expression at the posttranscriptional level in VSMC. The regulation of p27kip1 protein levels occurs mainly by regulation of its translation and protein stability (12Olashaw N. Pledger W.J. Science's STKE. 2002; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2002/53/RE7)PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-UTR region of p27kip1 mRNA has been shown to contain an IRES element (25Miskimins W.K. Wang G. Hawkinson M. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4960-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and is shown to regulate its translation (31Millard S.S. Vidal A. Markus M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5947-5959Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Some IRES elements from VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and c-Myc mRNAs function to enhance their translation under conditions when eIF2α is phosphorylated in cells (32Gerlitz G. Jagus R. Elroy-Stein O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that heparin treatment of VSMC resulted in PKR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (16Patel R.C. Handy I. Patel C.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1439-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that heparin enhances p27kip1 protein synthesis via the IRES element because it also causes eIF2α phosphorylation. To examine whether heparin was enhancing p27kip1 synthesis via the IRES element in its 5′-UTR, we examined the expression of luciferase reporter mRNA, which contained the murine IRES element of p27kip1 transcript. For this reason, we made use of the vector pLL, which encodes a bicistronic mRNA where Renilla luciferase is the first cistron and firefly luciferase is the second cistron (32Gerlitz G. Jagus R. Elroy-Stein O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The 502-bp long murine p27kip1 5′-UTR containing the IRES element (33Coleman J. Hawkinson M. Miskimins R. Miskimins W.K. BMC Mol. Biol. 2001; 2: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was cloned between the two reading frames (Fig. 4B). Firefly luciferase is translated at high levels only if the IRES element under study is active. Thus, the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity is high when the IRES element is active. As seen in Fig. 4C, the p27kip1 IRES element was highly active in VSMC because the ratio of firefly/Renilla luciferase activity is 15-fold higher in cells transfected with M502/pLL than in the cells transfected with empty vector pLL. As a positive control, a previously described (32Gerlitz G. Jagus R. Elroy-Stein O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2810-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) construct containing IRES element from VEGF mRNA was used (pLVL), which showed 3-fold higher activity than pLL as expected (data not shown). Thus, the p27kip1 IRES was more active than VEGF IRES in VSMC under these conditions. However, heparin treatment caused only a modest increase in IRES activity as seen in Fig. 4C. These results indicate that, although the IRES element functions to enhance the translation of p27kip1 mRNA in VSMC, it is not responsive to heparin treatment. Thus, the increase in p27kip1 synthesis is unlikely to be a mechanism by which heparin enhances the cellular p27kip1 protein levels. To determine whether heparin affected the p27kip1 protein stability, we performed the pulse-chase experiments. As seen in Fig. 5A (0 h lanes), a 2-h labeling period resulted in the labeling of p27kip1 to equal levels, both in the absence and presence of heparin. These results are in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 4 and further confirm that the rate of p27kip1 synthesis is same in the absence or presence of heparin. As seen during the chase, labeled p27kip1 protein is degraded to undetectable levels within 12 h in the absence of heparin. However, in the presence of heparin, the stability of p27kip1 protein is significantly enhanced, thereby indicating that heparin causes stabilization of p27kip1 protein during the G1 phase. The radioactivity present in the p27kip1 bands was quantif"

However, for planets with an internal magnetic field, emissions at radio wavelengths are modulated by the planet's rotation rate. The latest results from the Cassini spacecraft seem to indicate that Saturn's rotation rate has slowed down by 6 minutes since the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft flew by the planet in 1980 and 1981, but it is unclear whether a slowdown has in fact occurred. Future data collected by Cassini may be able to resolve the question."
https://openalex.org/W2014888396,"Cross-linking of proteins catalyzed by tissue transglutaminase has been suggested to play key roles in a variety of cellular events, including cell apoptosis and human pathogenesis (e.g. polyglutamine and Alzheimer diseases). It has often been suggested that tissue transglutaminase enhances aggregation and precipitation of damaged or pathogenic proteins. To ascertain whether this is accurate, we investigated the effects of tissue transglutaminase-catalyzed modulation on the aggregation of structurally damaged and unfolded proteins. Our results indicated that the aggregation and precipitation of some unfolded proteins were inhibited by transglutaminasecatalyzed reaction, although the effect was strongly dependent upon the target protein species. To elucidate the molecular events underlying the inhibitory effect, extensive analysis was performed with regard to reduced β-lactoglobulin using a number of techniques, including chromatography and spectroscopy. The results indicated that cross-linking yields high molecular weight soluble polymers but inhibits the growth of insoluble aggregates. The cross-linked β-lactoglobulin retained stable secondary structures with a hydrophobic core. We concluded that the transglutaminase-catalyzed intermolecular cross-linking did not necessarily enhance protein aggregation but could sometimes have a suppressive effect. The results of the present study suggested that tissue transglutaminase modifies aggregation and deposition of damaged or pathogenic proteins in vivo in a wide variety of manners depending on the target protein species and solution conditions.

Protein clustering occurs in the highly concentrated intra- and extracellular solutions of the living body (1Minton A.P. J. Biol.

Investigation of the factors that affect the intermolecular interactions of proteins are of primary importance from a biological viewpoint. Such information is also essential for clinical control of abnormal protein aggregation, such as amyloid formation in patients with neurodegenerative diseases (8Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The most important group of cross-linking enzymes is the transglutaminase (TG) 1The abbreviations used are: TG, transglutaminase; tTG, a tissue-type transglutaminase; βLG, bovine β-lactoglobulin A; αLA, human α-lactalbumin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; SEC, size-exclusion gel chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: TG, transglutaminase; tTG, a tissue-type transglutaminase; βLG, bovine β-lactoglobulin A; αLA, human α-lactalbumin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; SEC, size-exclusion gel chromatography. family (13Greenberg C.S.

TG are thiol- and Ca2+-dependent acyl transferases that catalyze formation of amide bonds between the γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues and the primary amino groups of various compounds, including the ϵ-amino group of lysine in proteins. It is commonly held that covalent cross-linking of protein molecules always enhances protein aggregation and precipitation. In fact, cross-linking by TG stabilizes blood clots and skin keratin under physiological conditions (13Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 15Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG) is also a candidate for the factor that induces formation of neuronal inclusions in the brains of patients with human diseases, such as the polyglutamine and Alzheimer diseases (16Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14310-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Lesort M. Tucholski J. Miller M.L. Johnson G.V. Prog.

Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).However, we have recently demonstrated that the cross-linking reaction catalyzed by tTG does not always enhance protein aggregation; the cross-linking reaction in the intramolecular mode was shown to strongly suppress the aggregation of disease-related proteins (20Konno T. Morii T. Hirata A. Sato S. Oiki S. Ikura K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2072-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This led to the question of whether the intermolecular mode of cross-linking would also suppress protein aggregation. In fact, Lai et al. (21Lai T.S. Tucker T. Burke J.R. Strittmatter W.J. Greenberg C.S. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) recently reported that tTG-catalyzed intermolecular cross-linking of a polyglutamine-containing protein formed high molecular weight soluble polymers, but inhibited precipitation. An accurate answer to this question must be pursued, as the tTG-catalyzed cross-linking has been suggested to play key roles in a variety of cellular events, including regulation of cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and human pathogenesis (14Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined whether the intermolecular cross-linking of damaged and structurally unfolded proteins enhances or inhibits their aggregation and precipitation. To assess this problem from a general viewpoint, we examined four structurally unrelated proteins as substrates of tTG: bovine β-lactoglobulin A (βLG; β-sheet-type), bovine serum albumin (BSA; α-helix-type), human α-lactalbumin (αLA; α/β-type), and bovine α-casein (natively unfolded type). βLG, αLA, and BSA were unfolded by reducing the disulfide bonds, which might be the simplest model for biological protein damage. First, we performed simple aggregation and cross-linking analysis of all the proteins. This was followed by extensive analysis for βLG as a typical case using biochemical and biophysical techniques.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Guinea pig liver transglutaminase was purified on an immunoadsorbent column as described previously (23Ikura K. Sakurai H. Okuma K. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 3527-3531Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). βLG, αLA, BSA, bovine α-casein, and bovine α-chymotrypsin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without further purification. Other chemicals of reagent grade were purchased from Nacalai Tesque Co. (Kyoto, Japan).Aggregation and Cross-linking Reactions—All of the sample solutions were prepared in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and the pH was adjusted carefully with small amounts of HCl. Non-covalent aggregation of βLG, BSA, and αLA was initiated by adding 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. The tTG-catalyzed cross-linking reaction was initiated by adding 130, 260, or 650 nm tTG, 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C. Irreversibly inactivated tTG used for control experiments was prepared by heat treatment of tTG at 70 °C for 5 min. A reference experiment under reducing conditions without aggregation and cross-linking of βLG was performed in a solution containing 10 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA. SDS-PAGE analysis was performed by the standard method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) with densitometric measurement of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel. Solution turbidity was measured by absorbance at 320 nm using a U-3300 spectrometer (Hitachi, Tokyo).In the experiments using α-casein, the protein was dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm DTT and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At this time point, tTG was added to the solution, and then the turbidity was monitored.Size-exclusion Gel Chromatography and Microfiltration—Analytical size-exclusion gel chromatography (SEC) was performed using the Class M10A HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a G3000SW column (Tosoh, Tokyo). The equilibrium and elution buffers were 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored. The samples loaded onto SEC (20 μl) were pretreated by microfiltration with an Ultrafree-MC filter (pore size, 0.22 μm; Millipore Co., Bedford, MA).Spectroscopic Measurements—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured with a Jasco J-820 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo) using a quartz cell with a path length of 0.5 or 1 mm. The protein concentrations were 6 and 150 μm for far- and near-UV measurements, respectively. The temperature of the cell was controlled using a Peltier-type PTC-423S apparatus (Jasco).Phase Separation of βLG Solutions in the Presence of CaCl2—The cross-linked samples were prepared in advance by adding 650 nm tTG and 5 mm CaCl2 to the reduced reference sample followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. The reduced reference and cross-linked samples containing 100 μm βLG and various concentrations of CaCl2 were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The samples after incubation were subjected to microfiltration (pore size, 0.22 μm), and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by averaging estimates obtained from absorbance at 280 nm and the BCA method. The concentrations of CaCl2 in the presence of 1 mm EDTA were determined by the method of Goldstein (25Goldstein D.A. Biophys. J. 1979; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).Proteolytic Digestion Experiments—The reaction mixtures containing 270 μm βLG and 10 mm DTT were used for the digestion experiments monitored by SDS-PAGE. Depending on the sample species, 650 nm tTG, 5 mm CaCl2, or 1 mm EDTA was added to the solutions. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, α-chymotrypsin was added at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C with stirring.RESULTStTG-catalyzed Suppression of Non-covalent Protein Aggregation and Precipitation—Structurally damaged and unfolded protein molecules have a strong tendency to form aggregates because exposure of hydrophobic parts of the protein interior to the aqueous environment enhances the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions that overcome electrostatic or other types of intermolecular repulsion. Accordingly, we expected that reduction of disulfide bonds and the subsequent unfolding of proteins would also induce their non-covalent aggregation in a medium of relatively high ionic strength that partially shields electrostatic repulsion. This type of aggregation and precipitation was actually observed for βLG, αLA, and BSA at neutral pH at 37 °C in the presence of DTT and Ca2+ (Fig. 1, A–C, star symbols). Aggregation of the reduced βLG was suppressed completely by chelation of trace ions by EDTA (Fig. 1A, filled circles). This sample containing highly reduced βLG without any aggregates in the presence of 1 mm EDTA is referred to as the “reduced reference” sample throughout this report. Addition of an excess amount of CaCl2 (e.g. 5 mm) to this reduced reference solution strongly induced non-covalent aggregation and precipitation of βLG (Fig. 1D, star symbols).The addition of tTG to the aggregating solutions described above inhibited the increase in turbidity of the proteins depending on the concentration of tTG (Fig. 1). Notably, the effect of tTG was much weaker for αLA than for βLG and BSA. Heat-inactivated tTG did not show this inhibitory effect (data not shown). Ca2+-induced aggregation of the reduced reference βLG shown in Fig. 1D could also be suppressed very efficiently by tTG (Fig. 1D, open symbols). Furthermore, disassembly of preformed aggregates by tTG was observed for α-casein. A solution of α-casein became turbid in the presence of CaCl2, and the turbidity decreased sharply by adding tTG at 37 °C (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the tTG-catalyzed reaction inhibited the non-covalent aggregation of unfolded proteins for at least some protein species.Fig. 2Turbidity changes of α-casein solution. α-Casein was dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm DTT and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At this time point, tTG was added at a concentration of 0 (•) or 260 nm (○). The solution turbidity was monitored by determining the absorbance at 320 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The solubility of tTG-modified βLG as a function of ionic strength was compared with that of the reduced reference βLG by changing the concentration of CaCl2 and measuring the residual protein concentration in the solution phase at 37 °C. The tTG-modified βLG exhibited phase separation and precipitation at [CaCl2] ≧ 20 mm, whereas the reduced reference βLG was precipitated at [CaCl2] ≧ 0.5 mm (Fig. 3). These results confirmed that tTG-catalyzed modification of the unfolded protein increased its solubility.Fig. 3Solubility of reduced βLGs as a function of [CaCl2]. Concentrations of the reduced reference (•) and cross-linked βLGs (○) in the solution phase were determined after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h.

Acta. 1996; 1292: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cross-linking reaction was the most plausible mechanism for the inhibition of precipitation and increase in protein solubility. To determine the detailed molecular events underlying this paradoxical phenomenon, further analyses were performed for the case of βLG shown in Fig. 1A. Note that cross-linking of βLG, αLA, and BSA did not occur without reduction of the disulfide-bonds (data not shown; Refs. 26Aboumahmoud R. Savello P. J. Dairy Sci. 1990; 73: 256-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Matsumura Y. Chanyongvorakul Y. Kumazawa Y. Ohtsuka T. Mori T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), probably because exposure of lysine and glutamine residues located on flexible protein chains is necessary for efficient cross-linking.Fig. 4tTG-catalyzed cross-linking of βLG monitored by SDS-PAGE. The βLG solution at a concentration of 270 μm contained 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and 650 nm tTG and was incubated at 37 °C for 0, 1, 3, 5, 6.5, or 24 h.

Arrow 2 indicates the position of tTG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Size-exclusion Gel Chromatography Combined with Microfiltration—Microfiltration (pore size, 0.22 μm) and SEC were combined to monitor the aggregation and cross-linking processes of βLG (Fig. 5). This method separated three different populations of βLG, although some errors caused by dissociation of rapidly dissociating oligomers during the time of chromatographic measurement could not be excluded. The three groups were large aggregates of >0.22 μm (group L; star symbols in Fig. 5, B and C), small aggregates of <0.22 μm (group S; filled symbols in Fig. 5, B and C), and non-aggregated βLG (group N; open symbols). Fractional changes in each population were monitored by measuring peak areas on the chromatograms (Fig. 5, B and C). The peak labeled “N” in Fig. 5A corresponds to the N group. The area of the S group was estimated by integrating the chromatogram at the elution time of 5 to 8.7 min including the void fraction (labeled “S” in Fig. 5A). The fractional values for the N and the S groups were calculated by dividing the areas by that of the N group at zero reaction time. The L fraction was estimated by assuming that the sum of the N, S, and L fractions should be unity.Fig. 5Size-exclusion gel chromatography of βLG in the aggregation and cross-linking processes.A, typical chromatograms for the sample without aggregation at 0 time (top panel) and the aggregated samples after a 5-h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0 nm (middle panel) or 650 nm tTG (bottom panel).

In the sample containing CaCl2 without tTG, the large aggregates of the L group appeared soon after the beginning of incubation, but the S fraction did not increase significantly (Fig. 5B). All of the molecules were in the L group after incubation for 24 h.In contrast, in the presence of tTG and CaCl2, the L fraction did not increase substantially, whereas the S fraction increased rapidly (Fig. 5C). In this case, essentially all the molecules were trapped in the S group after incubation for 24 h (Fig. 6, open symbols). These results indicated that reduced βLG modified by tTG could not grow to form large aggregates. The half-decay time constant (τ) of the N fraction of the tTG-containing sample was 4.2 ± 0.2 h (Figs. 5C and 6, open symbols). These decay kinetics were similar to those observed for the decay of the monomer fraction determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6, filled symbols). Both decays advanced at the same rate in the initial 4 h of incubation, indicating that growth of the S fraction in the presence of tTG could be explained completely by the cross-linking reaction at the early stages. The cross-linked high molecular weight βLG was trapped in the solution phase. At later stages of incubation, the decay of the N fraction of SEC was slightly faster than that of the monomer fraction on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6), suggesting a minor contribution of non-covalent mechanisms for the later assembly process of βLG.Fig. 6Kinetic changes in the monomer components in the presence of 650 nm tTG. The fraction of the N group monitored by SEC (○) and the monomer fraction monitored by SDS-PAGE (•) of cross-linked βLG. The solution contained 270 μm βLG, 650 nm tTG, 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm CaCl2 and was incubated at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Notably, most of the βLG molecules in the S group under cross-linking conditions were eluted in the void fraction at all incubation times (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). Oligomers with lower molecular weights were not present to a large extent. These observations were consistent with the results of SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 4), which did not exhibit a clear ladder-type pattern of polymerization. These results suggested that the rate-limiting step in polymerization was not the cross-linking step itself. The details of the cascade of events leading to cross-linking will be discussed later.Conformational Changes of βLG Accompanied by Cross-linking—The conformational changes of βLG accompanying reduction and cross-linking were analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The spectrum in the near-UV region of the reduced reference βLG showed a total loss of tertiary structures by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h (Fig. 7A, thick solid line). The decrease in ellipticity at ∼206 nm of the far-UV CD spectrum also demonstrated unfolding of secondary structures by reduction (Fig. 7A, thicksolid line). The near-UV CD spectrum of βLG in the presence of tTG and Ca2+ indicated that the cross-linking reaction did not inhibit the breakdown of the tertiary structures (Fig. 7B, broken line). However, unfolding of the secondary structures was partly blocked by cross-linking (compare the broken and thick solid lines in Fig. 7B). The addition of tTG and CaCl2 to the fully reduced reference sample also resulted in significant recovery of the shape of the far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 7C). The spectral shape of the cross-linked βLG shown in Fig. 7C was quite similar to that shown in Fig. 7B.Fig. 7CD spectra of βLGs.A, near-UV CD spectra of the samples incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of 10 mm DTT. Thick solid lines, 1 mm EDTA. Broken lines, 5 mm CaCl2 and 650 nm tTG. The spectrum of native βLG without reduction is also presented for comparison (thin solid line). B, far-UV CD spectra. The sample species were the same as those in A. C, far-UV CD spectra of reduced βLG with and without tTG-catalyzed cross-linking. Thick solid line, without cross-linking. Broken line, cross-linked. In this case, the reduced samples were prepared in advance by incubation of βLG (100 μm) in the presence of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, the cross-linked sample, prepared by adding 5 mm CaCl2 and 650 nm tTG to this highly reduced sample, was further incubated at 37 °C for 12 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetic details of the conformational changes of βLGs were monitored by ellipticities at [θ]206 and [θ]293. Tertiary structures of βLG represented by [θ]293 were lost in a single-phase manner for both the reduced reference and the cross-linked βLGs (Fig. 8A). The decay time constants of the two were similar to each other (τ = 4.2 ± 0.3 and 5.0 ± 0.4 h, respectively), indicating that the cross-linking reaction did not substantially perturb the unfolding process of the tertiary structures. In contrast, the cross-linking reaction significantly altered the kinetic trace of [θ]206. The trace for the reduced reference sample decreased in a biphasic manner with τ1 = 1.8 ± 0.2 and τ2 = 20.7 ± 3.2 h (Fig. 8B, filled symbols). The trace for the cross-linking sample also decreased monotonically until 5 h of incubation (Fig. 8B, open symbols). The decay constant of this part was 1.8 ± 0.3 h, exactly the same as that of the faster phase of the reduced reference sample. However, the change in [θ]206 of the slower phase was blocked completely by the tTG-catalyzed reaction. The trace exhibited a relatively sharp corner at 4–6 h of incubation, and the ellipticity even increased marginally at longer incubation times. These results indicated that the cross-linking reaction inhibited unfolding of the secondary structures at later stages. Note that CD analysis was not informative for the non-covalently aggregated sample without tTG because of the strong light scattering of the turbid solution.Fig. 8Kinetic changes in [θ]293 (A) and [θ]206 (B). βLG solution (270 μm) was incubated at 37 °C under reducing conditions. •, 1 mm EDTA and no tTG. ○, 5 mm CaCl2 and 650 nm tTG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stability of Cross-linked βLG—The stability of the residual secondary structure of cross-linked βLG was compared with that of the reduced reference βLG by far-UV CD spectroscopy. By decreasing the temperature from 25 to –3 °C, the residual structure of the reduced reference βLG was unfolded as indicated by a strong decrease in ellipticity at ∼200 nm (Fig. 9A, broken line). This change was completely reversible, indicating that the residual structure still contained a cooperative hydrophobic core (28Privalov P.L. Gill S.J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 191-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 29Privalov P.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The spectrum of the cross-linked βLG also changed reversibly in the direction of unfolding by cooling, but the magnitude of the change was much smaller (Fig. 9B, broken line). The results indicated that the residual secondary structure with a hydrophobic core of the cross-linked βLG was formed more tightly than that of the reduced reference βLG. We also compared the stability of the residual secondary structures by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation. The denaturation curve monitored by [θ]220 was composed of two phases for both the βLG species (Fig. 9C). The molecular origin of this biphasic behavior was not pursued in the present study. The results shown in Fig. 9C indicate that the residual secondary structure of the cross-linked sample was more stable than that of the reduced reference against the denaturant.Fig. 9Stability of residual structures of reduced βLGs.A and B, cooling-induced changes in the far-UV CD spectra of the reduced reference (A) and cross-linked βLG (B). The reduced reference sample (270 μm βLG) was prepared in 10 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 24 h. The cross-linked sample (270 μm βLG) was prepared in 10 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and 650 nm tTG at 37 °C for 24 h. The spectra were measured at 25 °C (solid lines) or –3°C (broken lines).

In this process, the 3′-end of <mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow>tRNA</mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mrow>Lys</mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math> must be annealed to the primer binding site of HIV-1 genomic RNA, and the two molecules together form a complex structure. During annealing, the nucleocapsid (NC) protein enhances the unwinding of tertiary structures within both RNA molecules. Moreover, the packaging of <mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow>tRNA</mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mrow>Lys</mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math> occurs prior to viral budding at a time when NC is still part of the Pr55<sup>Gag</sup> polyprotein. In contrast, Pr55<sup>Gag</sup> is able to produce virus-like particles on its own. We have recently shown that an N-terminal extended form of NC (mGag), containing all of the minimal elements required for virus-like particle formation, possesses greater affinity for HIV-1 genomic RNA than does NC alone. We have now studied the <mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mrow>tRNA</mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mrow>Lys</mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math>-annealing properties of mGag in comparison to those of NC and report that the former is more efficient in this regard than the latter. We have also tested each of a mutant version of mGag, an extended form of mGag, and an almost full-length form of Gag, and showed that all of these possessed greater tRNA-annealing capacity than did the viral NC protein. Yet, surprisingly, multimerization of Gag-related proteins did not abrogate this annealing process but rather resulted in dramatically reduced levels of reverse transcriptase processivity. These results suggest that the initial stages of reverse transcription may be regulated by the multimerization of Pr55<sup>Gag</sup> polyprotein at times prior to the cleavage of NC."
https://openalex.org/W2011889809,"The mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei lacks tRNA genes. Its translation system therefore depends on the import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs. Thus, except for the cytosol-specific initiator tRNA Met , all trypanosomal tRNAs function in both the cytosol and the mitochondrion. The only tRNA Met present in T. brucei mitochondria is therefore the one which, in the cytosol, is involved in translation elongation. Mitochondrial translation initiation depends on an initiator tRNA Met carrying a formylated methionine. This tRNA is then recognized by initiation factor 2, which brings it to the ribosome. To guarantee mitochondrial translation initiation, T. brucei has an unusual methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase that formylates elongator tRNA Met .I n the present study, we have identified initiation factor 2 of T. brucei and shown that its carboxyl-terminal domain specifically binds formylated trypanosomal elongator tRNA Met . Furthermore, the protein also recognizes the structurally very different Escherichia coli initiator tRNA Met , suggesting that the main determinant recognized is the formylated methionine. In vivo studies using stable RNA interference cell lines showed that knockdown of initiation factor 2, depending on which construct was used, causes slow growth or even growth arrest. Moreover, concomitantly with ablation of the protein, a loss of oxidative phosphorylation was observed. Finally, although ablation of the methionyltRNA formyltransferase on its own did not impair growth, a complete growth arrest was observed when it was combined with the initiation factor 2 RNA interference cell line showing the slow growth phenotype. Thus, these experiments illustrate the importance of mitochondrial translation initiation for growth of procyclic T. brucei."

In this Viewpoint, we discuss some of these results, which are reported in a collection of reports in this issue. The magnetosphere is shown to be highly variable and influenced by the planet's rotation, sources of plasma within the planetary system, and the solar wind. New insights are also gained into the chemical composition of the magnetosphere, with surprising results. These early results from Cassini's first orbit around Saturn bode well for the future as the spacecraft continues to orbit the planet."

https://openalex.org/W1561162651,"Europe invests only about one-sixth of the United States' spending in various space activities. Given the complicated organizational structure of government space spending in Europe and the lack of will or ability to increase the overall budgets, it will be difficult for Europe to maintain its place as a major player in the world's space activity. The author of this [Policy Forum][1] thinks that either the ambitions of Europe should be lowered in accordance with the available budgets, or the budgets should be adjusted upward. Without substantial increases in the budgets, Europe should not enter into new fields of space activity.
