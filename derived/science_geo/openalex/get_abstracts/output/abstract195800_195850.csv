If these two variables are adjusted to their numerical values in the cochlea of a living animal or a fresh preparation of the human ear, traveling waves are observed along the membrane. These traveling waves have a flat maximum that shifts its location along the membrane with a change of frequency-the place of the maximum determining the pitch. An enlarged dimensional model of the cochlea in which the nerve supply of the sensory organs on the basilar membrane was replaced by the skin of the arm indicates that the inhibitory action in the nervous system can produce quite sharp local sensations, which shift their place with changes in the frequency of the vibrations."

We thought that such suspensions might be suitable for studies of cellular respiration, but found that they contained too few intact cells and many mitochondria. The respiration of mitochondria was found to be unaffected even by concentrations of trypsin strong enough to lyse intact cells. An accidental observation suggested that a technique of mild acid digestion without added enzyme might be effective. A solution similar to Dulbecco and Vogt's phosphate buffer saline1 was used. The phosphates were replaced by the equivalent amount of phosphoric acid and the solution brought to the selected pH value with potassium hydroxide. The most acid solution used was at pH 2.3. This produced the greatest yield of separated cells ; but they barely respired. More alkaline solutions yielded fewer cells, but with increasing alkalinity the respiration-rate rose until with extraction at pH 4 a suspension could be obtained with a respiration-rate of the value given by Krebs2 for liver slices. In practice we thought it best to use a medium of pH 5, which when mixed with the chopped tissue gives a pH value of nearly 6."

https://openalex.org/W2052360610,"MANY biologically produced substances are known to lyse living micro-organisms. Among them, lysozyme has been studied most extensively for the mechanism of its action, and it has been shown that this action is the dissolution of cell wall, probably the hydrolysis of mucopolysaccharide contained in it1. Studies on the action of autolytic enzymes, on the other hand, are few, and their site of action has not hitherto been known. Recently, one of us observed very rapid autolysis of amylase-producing strains of Bacillus subtilis 2 and isolated an autolytic substance(s) from the lysate3. Studies on this autolytic substance(s) have shown that it lyses the cell wall."

The infection in the dog may lead to a clinically recognizable disease with acute renal symptoms leading to the death of the animal ; but a milder condition may occur and may escape detection. All degrees of infection give rise to the carrier state, which may persist for months or even years, during which time the leptospiras are expelled in the urine, which thereby constitutes a potential source of infection to other dogs and man."
