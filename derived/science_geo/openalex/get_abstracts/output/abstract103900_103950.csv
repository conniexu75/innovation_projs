https://openalex.org/W2078136106,"A monoclonal antibody (mAb) was isolated that blocked the binding and bioactivity of both human and murine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) on murine IL-1 receptor-bearing cells. This mAb recognized a protein that was distinct from the Type I and Type II IL-1 receptors, suggesting that an additional protein exists that is involved in IL-1 biological responses. By expression cloning in COS-7 cells, we have isolated a cDNA from mouse 3T3-LI cells encoding this putative auxiliary molecule, which we term the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1R AcP). Sequence analysis of the cDNA predicts an open reading frame that encodes a 570-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of ~66 kDa. The IL-1R AcP is a member of the Ig superfamily by analysis of its putative extracellular domain and also bears limited homology throughout the protein to both Type I and Type II IL-1 receptors. Northern analysis reveals that murine IL-1R AcP mRNA is expressed in many tissues and appears to be regulated by IL-1. In mammalian cells expressing natural or recombinant Type I IL-1R and IL-1R AcP, the accessory protein forms a complex with the Type I IL-1R and either IL-1α or IL-1β but not IL-1ra. The recombinant accessory protein also increases the binding affinity of the recombinant Type I IL-1R for IL-1β when the two receptor proteins are coexpressed. Therefore, the functional IL-1 receptor appears to be a complex composed of at least two subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2029621315,"The enterotoxin from Clostridium difficile (ToxA) is one of the causative agents of the antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. In cultured monolayer cells ToxA exhibits cytotoxic activity to induce disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which is accompanied by morphological changes. ToxA-induced depolymerization of actin filaments is correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins (Just, I., Selzer, J., von Eichel-Streiber, C., and Aktories, K.(1995) J. Clin. Invest. 95, 1026-1031). Here we report on the identification of the ToxA-induced modification of Rho. Applying electrospray mass spectrometry, the mass of the modification was determined as 162 Da, which is consistent with the incorporation of a hexose into Rho. From several hexoses tested UDP-glucose selectively served as cosubstrate for ToxA-catalyzed modification. The acceptor amino acid of glucosylation was identified from a Lys-C-generated peptide by tandem mass spectrometry as Thr-37. Mutation of Thr-37 to Ala completely abolished glucosylation. The members of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) were substrates for ToxA, whereas H-Ras, Rab5, and Arf1 were not glucosylated. ToxA-catalyzed glucosylation of lysates from ToxA-pretreated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells resulted in a decreased incorporation of [14C]glucose, indicating previous glucosylation in the intact cell.

Genetic analysis demonstrated an overall 63% homology of the amino acids of both toxins (4von Eichel-Streiber C. Laufenberg-Feldmann R. Sartingen S. Schulze J. Sauerborn M. Mol. & Gen.

In the hamster model ToxA induces the typical clinical picture resembling pseudomembranous colitis, whereas ToxB does not cause any kind of disease (5Lyerly D.M. Saum K.E. MacDonald D.K. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 349-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in cultured cell lines both toxins exhibit potent cytotoxic activities, which are characterized by a disaggregation of the actin cytoskeleton followed by rounding of the cells (1Lyerly D.M.

C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Rho at Asn-41 renders the small GTPase inactive, resulting in depolymerization of the actin filaments (13Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Because C. difficile toxins induced a decrease in Rho-ADP-ribosylation, which correlated with the toxin-caused depolymerization of actin filaments, it was suggested that ToxA and ToxB act on the regulatory Rho proteins. Several findings indicate a covalent modification of Rho (7Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin.

Toxin-induced modification of recombinant Rho depends on the presence of a consumable cytosolic factor, which is heat stable, nonproteinacious, and exhibits a molecular mass between 500 and 3000 Da (7Just I.

Rösener S. Blaschke U. Chhatwal G.S. Eur. J.

Recombinant proteins (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42Hs, and the mutant RhoAT37A) were purified from Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid expressing GST-RhoA (RhoAT37A, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) fusion protein. RhoA, RhoAT37A, and Rac1 plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. A. Hall (MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, London) and Cdc42Hs by Dr. M. Aepfelbacher (Institut für Prophylaxe und Epidemiologie der Kreislaufkrankheiten, Munich, Germany). The glutathione fusion proteins were isolated by affinity purification with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Germany) followed by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin (100 μg/ml for 30 min at 22°C). Thrombin was removed by precipitation with benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Germany). Rab5 was kindly donated by Dr. M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) and Arf1 by Dr. M. Schmidt (Institut für Pharmakologie, Essen, Germany). Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were cultured as described (7Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For intoxication the cells were incubated with ToxA (500 ng/ml) for 4 h followed by lysis as described below. RBL cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were then mechanically removed from the dishes in the presence of lysis buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5), sonicated 5 times on ice, and centrifuged (10 min at 2,000 × g). The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to give the cytosolic fraction. For preparation of the cytosolic subfraction, the cytosol was first incubated for 15 min at 95 min and then centrifuged (15 min at 30,000 × g). Thereafter, the supernatant was passed through a filter membrane (ultrafiltration membranes YM3, 3,000-Da cutoff, Amicon Corp.). Recombinant RhoA (50 μg/ml) was incubated with ToxA (10 μg/ml) in the presence of either cytosol from RBL cells, a cytosolic fraction, or various UDP-hexoses (as indicated) (50 μM) for 45 min at 37°C. Thereafter, the samples were incubated for 15 min at 37°C in a buffer (3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5) containing 10 μM [32P]NAD (0.5 μCi) and C3 exoenzyme (0.5 μg/ml) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The glucosylation reaction was performed in a medium containing 30 μM UDP-[14C]glucose (50 nCi), 3 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM GDP, 150 mM KCl, 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μg/ml ToxA, and the indicated recombinant GTPases (50 μg/ml) or cell lysate (2 mg/ml protein) in a total volume of 25 μl. The incubation was performed at 37°C for 45 min or as indicated. For the differential glucosylation 30 μM UDP-[14C]glucose (500 nCi) was used. After the incubation, Laemmli sample buffer was added and the proteins were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS gel electrophoresis according to Ref. 17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar. The gels were analyzed by the PhosphorImager SF from Molecular Dynamics. RhoA (100 μg) was treated without or with ToxA (10 μg/ml) in the presence of the cytosolic subfraction (<3,000 Da) for 90 min at 37°C and was then separated by HPLC chromatography on a Sephasil RP-C18 column (Pharmacia). The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After freeze drying, RhoA was dissolved in 200 μl of a medium containing 1 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, and 25 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 8.5 and incubated with Lys-C (10 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) for 16 h at 30°C. The digestion was stopped by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptides were separated on the Sephasil RP-C18 column with the same gradient as described above. For mass spectrometric analyses RhoA in its unmodified and modified form was purified with HPLC as described above. The masses of control and modified RhoA protein were measured on a electrospray triple quadrupole instrument (API III from Sciex-Perkin Elmer, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a modified electrospray source (18Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrometry Ion Proc. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar). One peptide from Lys-C digestion showed an altered retention time for the modified RhoA in HPLC separation. For identification it was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry in its modified and unmodified form. To localize the acceptor amino acid, the peptide was subdigested with pepsin. The resulting petide mixture was analyzed with mass spectrometry. A modified peptide in the digest of the original modified RhoA petide was selected for fragmentation. Its smallest fragment, which still contained the modification, identified the acceptor amino acid. ToxA (250 μg/ml) was incubated in buffer (10 μl) containing 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mM KCl, and 25 μM UDP-[14C]glucose (80 nCi) for the indicated times at 37°C. Samples were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose and run with 0.25 M LiCl. Evaluation of the TLC was performed with the PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics). For testing other hexoses, 14C-labeled UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine were used. Recombinant RhoA, which had been treated with ToxA in the presence of the cytosolic subfraction (<3,000 Da), was separated by HPLC and, subsequently, subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry. The mass of the complete protein was 162 ± 0.8 Da higher than the unmodified protein (not shown). These data are consistent with a monoglycosylation of RhoA (180-Da hexose minus 18 Da of released H2O). To identify the type of sugar incorporated into Rho several hexoses were tested. Because the molecular weight of the cosubstrate is higher than 500 (7Just I. Selzer J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Aktories K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), simple monohexoses (Mr 180) were ruled out and activated forms of hexoses (UDP- and GDP-hexoses, Mr 566) were tested (Fig. 1). Only in the presence of UDP-glucose, ToxA was able to inhibit the C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of RhoA. Applying UDP-[14C]glucose, ToxA catalyzed the incorporation of [14C]glucose into RhoA (Fig. 2A). Hydrolysis of UDP-glucose to glucose 1-phosphate by treatment with phosphodiesterase or oxidation to UDP-glucuronic acid by dehydrogenase completely abolished incorporation of glucose, indicating that UDP-glucose is the actual cosubstrate (Fig. 2A). Monoglucosylation of RhoA depended on the native structure of both the substrate RhoA and the transferase ToxA because denaturation of either completely inhibited incorporation of glucose (not shown). Glucosylation of Rho is significantly enhanced in the presence of 150 mM KCl whereas 150 mM NaCl did not increase incorporation (not shown). The time course of glucosylation showed that incorporation of glucose did not exceed incorporation of 1 mol of glucose/mol of Rho (Fig. 2C), consistent with the findings of the mass spectrometry.Figure 2:ToxA-catalyzed incorporation of glucose into Rho proteins. A, prior to the glucosylation reaction, 30 μM UDP-[14C]glucose (50 nCi) was treated with either 50 μg/ml phosphodiesterase from Crotalus durissus (lane2) or with 500 μg/ml UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and 100 μM NAD (lane3) for 30 min at 30°C followed by incubation for 15 min at 95°C to inactivate the UDP-glucose-degrading enzymes. Lane1, control. Thereafter, the glucosylation reaction (25 μl) was started by the addition of RhoA and ToxA. B, substrate specificity of ToxA. The indicated recombinant low molecular mass GTPases (50 μg/ml, dissolved in 3 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM GDP, 150 mM KCl, 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5) or lysate from RBL cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml ToxA and 30 μM UDP-[14C]glucose (50 nCi) in a total volume of 25 μl for 45 min at 37°C. C, time course of ToxA-catalyzed incorporation of glucose in the Rho subtype proteins. The glucosylation reaction of RhoA (■), Rac1 (▲), and Cdc42Hs (●) (each 50 μg/ml) was performed as described in B. After the indicated times, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). From the PhosphorImager data incorporation of glucose was calculated (mol of glucose/mol of G-protein). D, glucosylation of RhoAT37A. RhoAT37A (50 μg/ml, dissolved in 3 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM GDP, 150 mM KCl, 50 mM triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5) was either incubated with C3 (0.5 μg/ml) and [32P]NAD (10 μM) (lane1) or with ToxA (10 μg/ml) and UDP-[14C]glucose (30 μM) (lane2) for 45 min at 37°C. PhosphorImager data from SDS-PAGE are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cell-free systems, ToxA exhibits its enzymatic effects on Rho only at 50-100 times higher concentration than usually applied to intact cells. This finding indicates that ToxA is most likely activated intracellularly but not in the cell-free assay. Because ToxA is taken up via receptor-mediated endocytosis (1Lyerly D.M. Krivan H.C. Wilkins T.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 1: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 6Fiorentini C. Thelestam M. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 543-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19von Eichel-Streiber C. Warfolomeow I. Knautz D. Sauerborn M. Hadding U. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), it is most likely that ToxA is activated in the postendosomes comparable with the reported mechanisms of diphtheria, pertussis, and cholera toxins (20Madshus I.H. Stenmark H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 175: 2-26Google Scholar) to elicit its transferase activity in the cytosol. Bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases catalyze incorporation of ADP-ribose into eukaryotic target proteins by glycosidic bonds, but in the absence of target proteins, they exhibit NAD glycohydrolase activity and cleave NAD to ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. We tested whether ToxA exhibits a comparable activity to cleave UDP-glucose into glucose and UDP. As shown in Fig. 3, ToxA cleaved UDP-glucose in a time-dependent manner. Other UDP-hexoses (UDP-galactose, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine) were not hydrolyzed. These data indicate that ToxA exhibits both transferase and glycohydrolase activity. To identify the acceptor amino acid of glucosylation, modified and unmodified RhoA was digested with endopeptidase Lys-C. The peptides of both digests were separated by HPLC on a Sephasil RP-C18 column. In the separation of the peptides from modified RhoA one additional peak appeared. Mass spectrometry of this HPLC fraction showed a mass of 2935.5 Da, which was 162 Da higher than that of a peptide fragment corresponding to D28-K51 (2774.0 Da). The assignment to peptide D28-K51 was confirmed by sequencing of the unmodified (Fig. 4A) and the modified peptide (Fig. 4B) with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ES MS/MS) using a NanoES source (18Wilm M.S. Mann M. Int. J. Mass Spectrometry Ion Proc. 1994; 136: 167-180Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Both MS/MS spectra revealed the same peptide sequence of the residues Asp28 to Lys51 of the RhoA protein. The modification was localized within the N-terminal 16 residues (Fig. 4B). For final determination of the site of modification the modified peptide (Asp28-Lys40) was subdigested with pepsin, and the digest was analyzed directly by ES MS/MS (Fig. 4C). The peptide Asp28-Glu40 in its modified form was identified in the digest by its mass (1730.9 Da) and by its sequence. ES MS/MS shows that the Thr37 residue carries the modification (Fig. 4C). As can be deduced from the crystal structure of H-Ras, Thr35 (Thr37 in Rho) is located in the GTP-binding and hydrolyzing domain (G-2) and participates in the coordination of Mg2+, which is the ligand for β- and γ-phosphates of GTP (21Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In the GDP-bound state, loop L2 moves and Thr35 (Thr37 in Rho) is now accessible (22Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Consistent with this model is our finding that GTP-bound Rho is a poor substrate compared with the GDP-bound form (data not shown). To assess the specificity of the acceptor amino acid Thr37, we tested whether the exchange of Thr in position 37 to Ala abolishes glucosylation (Fig. 2D). RhoAT37A was still ADP-ribosylated by C3 exoenzyme indicating no gross alteration of the protein structure in this mutant form. However, glucosylation of RhoAT37A by ToxA was completely blocked. There are no alternative acceptor amino acid residues that are modified when the acceptor Thr37 is eliminated by mutation. These findings prove that ToxA selectively catalyzes attachment of glucose to Thr38 in Rho. As Thr37 is located in the putative effector domain of Rho (23Self A.J. Paterson H.F. Hall A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 655-661PubMed Google Scholar), the hydrophilic glucose group in this domain might interfere with the interaction of activated Rho protein with the effector protein. This notion is in agreement with the observed disassembly of actin filaments, resulting from a blockade of the signal transduction due to Rho modification. Incubation of RBL cell lysates with ToxA in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose resulted in labeling of cellular proteins with a molecular mass in the range of 20-24 kDa. No additional proteins were labeled. These findings were observed with several cell lines (NIH3T3 fibroblasts and PtK2 kidney epithelial cells). To identify the target proteins of glucosylation, several recombinant low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins were tested. As shown in Fig. 2B, members of the Rho subfamily (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) were glucosylated, whereas the other Ras-related GTPases (H-Ras, Rab5, and Arf1) were not substrates for ToxA. Because all the members of the Ras superfamily share a threonine in domain G-2 at the same position (24Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar), it seems that structural requirements only present in Rho subtype proteins are essential for modification by ToxA. As shown for RhoA, incorporation of glucose did not exceed 1 mol/mol of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, respectively, consistent with monoglucosylation of these proteins (Fig. 2C). The Rho subtype proteins seem to be the exclusive target proteins of ToxA. To test whether Rho proteins were glucosylated in intact cells during the intoxication process, the method of differential glucosylation was applied. Assuming that in intact cells ToxA catalyzes glucosylation of Rho subtype proteins, subsequent 14C glucosylation of the lysates should result in a decreased incorporation of [14C]glucose into the GTPases. As shown in Fig. 5 pretreatment of cells with ToxA decreased glucosylation of two substrate proteins (doubleband). The upperband of the doublet was identified as RhoA and the lower one as Cdc42Hs by immunoblot of two-dimensional separated cell lysates 14C-glucosylated by ToxA (data not shown). As expected, C3-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of Rho was also inhibited (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that ToxA most likely catalyzes glucosylation of the Rho subtype proteins not only in cell lysates but also in intact cells. In summary, we demonstrate that C. difficile ToxA catalyzes the O-glucosylation of Rho subtype proteins in Thr37. Substrate specificity of ToxA is restricted to the Rho family (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42Hs) whereas other subtypes of the Ras superfamily are not substrates. Because ToxA-catalyzed glucosylation of Rho proteins occurs in intact cells we suggest that monoglucosylation is the molecular mechanism by which ToxA mediates its cytotoxicity and probably its in vivo enterotoxicity. The identified modification of GTP-binding proteins is a novel mode of action by which bacterial toxins directly attack intracellular regulatory proteins of eukaryotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2029130174,"Exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mediates adaptive responses or oxidative damage, depending on the magnitude of the challenge. Determining the threshold for peroxide-mediated oxidative stress thus requires quantitation of the changes in endogenous H2O2 production. The intracellular steady-state concentrations of H2O2 were measured in intact Escherichia coli under different conditions. Compounds that block electron transport at NADH dehydrogenase (rotenone) or between ubiquinone and cytochrome b (antimycin) showed that univalent reduction of O2 can occur at these sites in vivo to form superoxide anion (O2−), in agreement with reports for mammalian mitochondria. Mutational inactivation of different components of the respiratory chain showed that H2O2 production also depended on the energy status of the cell and on the arrangement of respiratory chain components corresponding to particular growth conditions. Production rates for O2− and H2O2 were linearly related to the number of active respiratory chains that reached maximal values during exponential growth. In the strains defective in respiratory chain components, catalase activity was regulated to compensate for changes in the H2O2 production rates, which maintained intracellular H2O2 at 0.1-0.2 μM during aerobic growth over a wide range of cell densities. The expression of a katG′::lacZ fusion (reporting transcriptional control of the catalase-hydroperoxidase I gene) was increased by H2O2 given either as a pulse or as a steady production. This response not only depended on the type and severity of the stimulus but was also strongly influenced by the growth phase of the cells. Exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) mediates adaptive responses or oxidative damage, depending on the magnitude of the challenge. Determining the threshold for peroxide-mediated oxidative stress thus requires quantitation of the changes in endogenous H2O2 production. The intracellular steady-state concentrations of H2O2 were measured in intact Escherichia coli under different conditions.

The IL-4R primary binding subunit (called IL-4Rα) does not by itself bind IL-13. We show that the ability of IL-13 to partially compete for IL-4 binding to some human cell types depended on co-expression of IL-4R and IL-13R. However, IL-13 binding was always associated with IL-4 binding. Hyperexpression of IL-4Rα on cells expressing both IL-4R and IL-13R decreased their binding affinity for IL-4, abrogated the ability of IL-13 to compete for IL-4 binding, and yet had no effect on IL-13R properties. Anti-human IL-4Rα monoclonal antibodies which blocked the biological function and binding of IL-4 also blocked the function and binding of IL-13.

https://openalex.org/W2059594639,"The A2a adenosine receptor is a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family, and its activation stimulates cyclic AMP production. To determine the residues which are involved in ligand binding, several residues in transmembrane domains 5-7 were individually replaced with alanine and other amino acids. The binding properties of the resultant mutant receptors were determined in transfected COS-7 cells. To study the expression levels in COS-7 cells, mutant receptors were tagged at their amino terminus with a hemagglutinin epitope, which allowed their immunological detection in the plasma membrane by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5. The functional properties of mutant receptors were determined by measuring stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Specific binding of [3H]CGS 21680 (15 nM) and [3H]XAC (4 nM), an A2a agonist and antagonist, respectively, was absent in the following Ala mutants: F182A, H250A, N253A, I274A, H278A, and S281A, although they were well expressed in the plasma membrane. The hydroxy group of Ser-277 is required for high affinity binding of agonists, but not antagonists. An N181S mutant lost affinity for adenosine agonists substituted at N6 or C-2, but not at C-5′. The mutant receptors I274A, S277A, and H278A showed full stimulation of adenylate cyclase at high concentrations of CGS 21680. The functional agonist potencies at mutant receptors that lacked radioligand binding were >30-fold less than those at the wild type receptor. His-250 appears to be a required component of a hydrophobic pocket, and H-bonding to this residue is not essential. On the other hand, replacement of His-278 with other aromatic residues was not tolerated in ligand binding. Thus, some of the residues targeted in this study may be involved in the direct interaction with ligands in the human A2a adenosine receptor. A molecular model based on the structure of rhodopsin, in which the 5′-NH in NECA is hydrogen bonded to Ser-277 and His-278, was developed in order to visualize the environment of the ligand binding site."

To better understand how different domains of the JAK2 function to regulate association and phosphorylation of the βc receptor, the minimal portion of the βc receptor necessary for JAK2 binding has been determined. Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins expressing different portions of the membrane-proximal domain of the βc chain, we demonstrate that JAK2 binds to amino acids 458-495, but showed little binding to fusion proteins containing amino acids 483-559, 483-530, or 458-484. The GST-βc 458-495 bound equally well to the wild type (WT) JAK2, a carboxyl-terminal deletion of JAK2 removing the protein kinase domain (amino acids 1000-1129), and a deletion of the kinase-like domain (amino acids 523-746). However, an amino-terminal JAK2 deletion (amino acids 2-239) markedly reduced binding to this GST-βc.

Phosphorylated rat kidney Na,K-ATPase was incubated with trypsin at a protease/ATPase ratio of 1:100 either directly in phosphorylation medium or after centrifugation (40,000 rpm, 4°C for 1 h) and resuspension in 25 mM imidazole, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4), 15 mM NaCl. Tryptic hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for the times indicated and then stopped by the addition of 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Tryptic hydrolyzates were precipitated with cold methanol (9 volumes of methanol/1 volume of protein solution), and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Some aggregation occurred after precipitation (see Fig. 4D). L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (type XIII) was from Sigma. Tryptic digestion of Na,K-ATPase was also performed during gel electrophoresis (Sweadner, 1991Sweadner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase was stopped with electrophoresis sample buffer, and then soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and trypsin were added to concentrations indicated in figure legends. Samples were loaded on a 1.5 mm thick 12.5% gel and run at constant current of 30 mA. Purified rat kidney Na,K-ATPase was phosphorylated by PKC with [γ-32P]ATP as described above. After 30 min at 30°C, proteins were precipitated with 3 volumes of cold chloroform/methanol (2:1 (v/v)), vortexed, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min, at 4°C. The separated aqueous and organic phases were carefully removed. The protein extract located at the interface was saved, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. Labeled Na,K-ATPase (Mr 95,000) and autophosphorylated PKC (Mr 80,000) were separated on a 7.5% Laemmli gel and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (ProBlott, Applied Biosystems Inc.) in 10 mM CAPS, pH 11, containing 20% methanol. Membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250, and the band of Na,K-ATPase was cut out, washed with deionized water, and air dried. N-terminal sequence analysis by Edman degradation was performed at the Biopolymer Core Facility, Endocrine Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, with an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed liquid sequencer in conditions developed to permit elution and quantification of phosphorylated serines.2( 2A. Khatri, T. R. Ostrea, M. S. Feschenko, and K. J. Sweadner, manuscript in preparation.) In two separate experiments, 50 and 25 pmol of α subunit were applied for sequencing, and initial yields of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were 20-25 and 14-15 pmol, respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates phosphorylation of purified Na,K-ATPase from rat, dog, and pig kidneys. In conditions where phosphorylation of rat kidney α-subunit was close to 1 mol of 32P/mol of Na,K-ATPase, pig and dog Na,K-ATPases gave only 10-19% of this level (data of four experiments). In all three cases, the Na,K-ATPase isoform present is α1. Attempts to increase phosphate incorporation in pig and dog Na,K-ATPases by changing the phosphorylation conditions (time, concentrations of ATPases and PKC, medium constituents) were unsuccessful. The possibility that there is contaminating phosphatase activity in dog and pig Na,K-ATPase preparations but not in that from the rat was previously tested and ruled out (Feschenko and Sweadner, 1994Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest hypothesis to explain the low level of phosphorylation of dog and pig kidney Na,K-ATPases is that a key phosphorylation site is missing from their primary structures. When the sequences of rat, pig, and dog α1 are compared, there are only three locations where serines or threonines present in rat α1 are missing from both dog and pig α1 (Ser-18, Ser-114, and Thr-884). We mapped the phosphorylation site on fragments obtained by limited tryptic hydrolysis and identified the fragments with appropriate antibodies. Fig. 2 diagrams the fragments predicted to be found after three different digestion procedures; the reproducible fragmentation patterns have been described before (Sweadner, 1991Sweadner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, J and Farley, 1988J P.L. Farley R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Digestion in the Na,K-ATPase conformation known as E2 (the K+ form) would remove Ser-18, leave Ser-118 in a 40-kDa fragment, and leave Thr-884 in a 60-kDa fragment. The E2 conformation should be adopted in our phosphorylation conditions (Mg2+ and Pi, plus low ATP, Ca2+ and other constituents necessary for the kinase), and so digestion immediately following phosphorylation was tried first (Fig. 3). Rapid disappearance of the 32P-labeled α subunit band was observed under these conditions (Fig. 3A). Immunostaining with a peptide-directed antibody against the N terminus gave a picture similar to the autoradiogram (Fig. 3B). No phosphorylated tryptic fragments were detected. The same blot was restained with antibody against a peptide at the C terminus. This antibody recognized a 64-kDa fragment, as expected (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3C). The appearance of the fragment of about 40 kDa at the 4-min time point (also stained by the C-terminal antibody) is due to secondary cleavage at a site named T4, observed earlier in the E2 conformation of Na,K-ATPase (Sweadner and Arystarkhova, 1992Sweadner K.J. Arystarkhova E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The result clearly indicates that the PKC phosphorylation site or sites are located in the N-terminal part of the molecule and not in the C-terminal half. The failure to see any phosphorylated tryptic fragments suggested that the site may lie in a short region at the N terminus that is clipped off by digestion at a site known as T2. This site can be cleaved preferentially by trypsinolysis in the E1 conformation (the Na+ form) (Fig. 2). After phosphorylation, the Na,K-ATPase was pelleted and resuspended in Na+-containing buffer and then digested. After 1 min with trypsin, a significant decrease in radioactivity was seen (Fig. 4A). Staining with the peptide-directed antiserum against the N terminus or with the monoclonal antibody McK1 (Fig. 4, B and C) marked a pattern of bands indistinguishable from that detected on the autoradiogram. The epitope of McK1 is known to be located between the T2 site and the epitope of the peptide-directed antibody (Felsenfeld and Sweadner, 1988Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Polyclonal antiserum K1 recognized additional fragments (Fig. 4D). One of the abundant fragments had a molecular weight slightly lower than the α-subunit, but it was recognized by neither N terminus antibody, and it was not radioactively labeled. We can conclude that the PKC phosphorylation site is located within the first 32 amino acids before the T2 cleavage site. To demonstrate retention of 32P label in a fragment including the N terminus, proteolytic fingerprinting was used (Fig. 5). Tryptic cleavage was performed directly in the Laemmli gel in the presence of soybean trypsin inhibitor, which paradoxically stabilizes trypsin against SDS inactivation (Sweadner, 1991Sweadner K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This approach permitted us to get a completely different tryptic pattern and thus to visualize fragments bearing the 32P label. The most highly radioactive polypeptide was about 25 kDa (Fig. 5A); other labeled fragments represent sequential degradation of the Na,K-ATPase. Exactly the same fragments were stained by antibody against the N terminus (Fig. 5B). Staining with polyclonal antibodies revealed additional nonradioactive fragments (Fig. 5C). Taken together, the results of the three experiments suggest that the PKC phosphorylation site is located close to the N terminus. When digestion was performed in E1 or E2 conditions (Fig. 3 and 4), extensive digestion at the numerous Lys and Arg residues there (Fig. 2) apparently precluded recovery of a labeled fragment. When the N-terminal sequence of rat kidney α1-subunit is examined, only two serines (Sweadner, 1988Sweadner K.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and J and Farley, 1988J P.L. Farley R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and no threonines are found. Although only Ser-18 is within a consensus motif for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, we could not rule out that Ser-11 might be phosphorylated as well. To identify the amino acid(s) phosphorylated, we used direct Edman degradation of 32P-labeled protein. Purified rat kidney Na,K-ATPase was phosphorylated by PKC in conditions shown to result in phosphate incorporation of close to 1 mol of 32P/mol of α-subunit (Feschenko and Sweadner, 1994Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeled Na,K-ATPase was electrophoresed and transferred to ProBlott membrane for N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. At each sequencing cycle, one-third of the eluted phenylthiohydantoin-derivative was identified by high performance liquid chromatography, and two-thirds was collected and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Fig. 6 displays the amount of 32P radioactivity recovered at each sequence cycle along with the identified amino acid and its yield. Some nonphosphorylated serine was recovered at both cycles 11 and 18. The recovery of unphosphorylated serine of course cannot be used to estimate the yield for that cycle. The average repetitive yield in this analysis was 94.88%.3( 3To calculate the average repetitive yield, we used the repetitive yields of the most stable amino acids, Gly, Asp, and Ala.) Actual yields appeared to be even lower toward the end, possibly due to the elution of proteins noncovalently adsorbed to membrane, and the typically poor recovery of lysines, which are clustered at the end surrounding Ser-18. To estimate the ratio of label in Ser-18 to Ser-11, we normalized the counts obtained against the calculated repetitive yield of 94.88%. This most conservative estimate suggests that there was at least 3 times as much 32P in Ser-18 as in Ser-11. Since the real yields at the end of sequencing run were probably lower, it is likely that the ratio is even higher. There is a large body of evidence that Na,K-ATPase can be a substrate for PKC-dependent phosphorylation in vitro(Beguin et al., 1994Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Chibalin A.V. Burgener-Kairuz P. Jaisser F.

During in vitro experiments, we found that phosphate incorporation in rat kidney Na,K-ATPase was 6-8-fold higher than in that from pig and dog. Low stoichiometries (0.15-0.18 mol of phosphate/mol of α subunit) for PKC phosphorylation of dog (Lowndes et al., 1990Lowndes J.M. Hokin Neaverson M. Bertics P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Stimulation of endogenous PKC increased phosphate incorporation in Na,K-ATPase α-subunit from opossum kidney cells (OK cells), but not from porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK1). The data not only demonstrate that phosphorylation does take place in living cells, but they also are in line with our finding that PKC phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase from different species is not equivalent. We would predict that the opossum α-subunit should contain an additional site analogous to that in the rat. In contrast to protein kinase A phosphorylation (for which only one consensus motif exists in rat α1) there are more than 30 consensus sequences for PKC-dependent phosphorylation. It was shown by different methods that the protein kinase A site is actually used for phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo (Beguin et al., 1994Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Chibalin A.V.

Total phosphate incorporation was only 0.18 mol of phosphate/mol of α-subunit, however, and neither of the phosphorylated amino acids was within a conventional phosphorylation motif for PKC, which is known to be (K/R)X1-2(S/T) (Pearson and Kemp, 1991Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Mutations of a number of other serine and threonine residues that were in phosphorylation motifs did not alter phosphate incorporation into the α1-subunit from B. marinus. Thus the authors concluded that a novel motif for PKC-mediated phosphorylation was found. A similar motif exists in no other known PKC substrates, except for the autophosphorylation sites of PKC itself (Flint et al., 1990Flint A.J. Paladini R.D. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1990; 249: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), where lysine or arginine residues flanking the phosphorylated amino acid are not necessary. In the present study, we identified two PKC phosphorylation sites with different phosphorylatability in rat kidney α1 subunit, Ser-11 and Ser-18. Phosphorylation was found exclusively in the N terminus of the molecule, similar to that found in B. marinus (Fig. 7). Since the majority of 32P label (75% or more) was found in Ser-18, and this amino acid is within a consensus motif for PKC phosphorylation, we would hypothesize that Ser-18 is the main site of phosphorylation in rat α1. Although Ser-11 was observed to be phosphorylated to a lower extent, we cannot rule out the possibility that the two sites are equivalent in their phosphorylatability, but some preexisting, stable phosphorylation of Ser-11 interfered with the incorporation of additional 32P. In this case, the level of phosphorylation in rat Na,K-ATPase still would be higher than in pig and dog Na,K-ATPases, and the theoretical stoichiometries would be 2 and 1 mol of phosphate/mol of Na,K-ATPase, respectively. It is of interest that phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase by PKC is highly specific, as it occurs only at the N terminus of the α-subunit in spite of the many consensus sequences. There is general interest in the role of the N terminus because of its isoform and species divergence in a family of highly homologous proteins. Although cutting the N terminus off (Wierzbicki and Blostein, 1993Wierzbicki W. Blostein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, J, 1975J P.L.

The most prominent feature of the N terminus is that the region contains a high proportion of positively charged amino acids, and thus the introduction of the negative phosphate groups may alter the structure with functional consequences similar to deletion. Our attempts to find an influence of PKC phosphorylation on the rat Na,K-ATPase activity assessed in maximal turnover conditions were unsuccessful (Feschenko and Sweadner, 1994Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although recently it was reported that phosphorylation of duck salt gland α subunit by PKC decreased its affinity for Na+ 2.4-fold (Lopina et al., 1995Lopina O.D.

Interestingly, a serine analogous to Ser-11 is conserved in all vertebrate α1s and all vertebrate α2s, while it is missing in all arthropods, Hydra, and vertebrate α3s (Table I). In contrast, a serine similar to Ser-18 of rat α1 is found only in rat α3 (KKSKAK), and in Catostomus (KKKSKNK), Torpedo (KNSKKSKSK), and Hydra (KKSAP) α1s. Nothing like it is found in any α2; human or chicken α3; the H,K-ATPase of the colon; or any of these α1s: dog, pig, human, mouse, horse, chicken, Bufo, Xenopus, Anguilla (European eel), Drosophila, or Artemia.5( 5The Artemia Na,K-ATPase sequence found in GenBank, accession number X56650.) A few other αs have candidate sites within the first 30 amino acids that are consensus sequences for PKC but which could not be called homologous: rat, human, and chicken α2 (REYS); rat, human, and chicken α3 (KSS, KDS, KES, respectively); a different Artemia α subunit6( 6The distinct Artemia Na,K-ATPase sequence found in GenBank, accession number Y07513.) (KQLS); cat flea α1 (RSDS, RVAT, RRKT, and KTPT); and gastric H,K-ATPase of rat, human, and pig (KMSKKK).Tabled 1 This analysis of PKC consensus sites suggests that rat α3 should be a good candidate for phosphorylation. Thus we tested this hypothesis using a purified axolemmal Na,K-ATPase preparation, which is known to consist of α2 and α3 isoforms predominantly (Urayama and Sweadner, 1988Urayama O. Sweadner K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The preparation we used contained no more than 5% of α1 isoform as detected with the help of a monoclonal antibody (McK1) specific for the rat α1. Phosphorylation of rat axolemma Na,K-ATPase by PKC was 16-20% of the maximal level seen with rat kidney enzyme (data not shown). This is more than can be accounted for by the α1 present. The low level of phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase from rat axolemma suggests, like for pig and dog α1, that the other isoforms are either isolated in an already partly phosphorylated state or that phosphorylatability of the relevant residue(s) is intrinsically low. The identification of PKC-mediated phosphorylation at sites close to the N terminus of the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase focuses interest on this relatively divergent segment of the protein. No other sites were detectably phosphorylated, including the site near the C terminus, RRNSV, that is known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A. The relatively poorly phosphorylated PKC site is well conserved among various Na,K-ATPases, while the better phosphorylated site found in the rat has only a few homologs among all of the known sequences. This suggests that species-specific adaptations, like those affecting cardiac glycoside sensitivity, may extend to mechanisms of kinase-mediated regulation as well."
https://openalex.org/W2051439628,"NHE3, a cloned intestinal and renal brush border Na+/H+ exchanger, has previously been shown to be both stimulated and inhibited by different protein kinases/growth factors. For instance, NHE3 is stimulated by serum and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and inhibited by protein kinase C. In the present study, we used a series of NHE3 C terminus truncation mutants to identify separate regions of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail responsible for stimulation and inhibition by protein kinases/growth factors. Five NHE3 C terminus truncation mutant stable cell lines were generated by stably transfecting NHE3 deletion cDNAs into PS120 fibroblasts, which lack any endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger. Using fluorometric techniques, the effects of the calcium/calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor W13, calcium/CaM kinase inhibitor KN-62, phorbol myristate acetate, okadaic acid, FGF, and fetal bovine serum on Na+/H+ exchange were studied in these transfected cells. Inhibition of basal activity of full-length NHE3 is mediated by CaM at a site C-terminal to amino acid 756; this CaM effect occurs through both kinase dependent and independent mechanisms. There is another independent inhibitory domain for protein kinase C between amino acids 585 and 689. In addition, there are at least three stimulatory regions in the C-terminal domain of NHE3, corresponding to amino acids 509-543 for okadaic acid, 475-509 for FGF, and a region N-terminal to amino acid 475 for fetal bovine serum. We conclude that separate regions of the C terminus of NHE3 are involved with stimulation or inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange activity, with both stimulatory and inhibitory domains having several discrete subdomains. A conservative model to explain the way these multiple domains in the C terminus of NHE3 regulate Na+/H+ exchange is via an effect on associated regulatory proteins. NHE3, a cloned intestinal and renal brush border Na+/H+ exchanger, has previously been shown to be both stimulated and inhibited by different protein kinases/growth factors. For instance, NHE3 is stimulated by serum and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and inhibited by protein kinase C. In the present study, we used a series of NHE3 C terminus truncation mutants to identify separate regions of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail responsible for stimulation and inhibition by protein kinases/growth factors. Five NHE3 C terminus truncation mutant stable cell lines were generated by stably transfecting NHE3 deletion cDNAs into PS120 fibroblasts, which lack any endogenous Na+/H+ exchanger. Using fluorometric techniques, the effects of the calcium/calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor W13, calcium/CaM kinase inhibitor KN-62, phorbol myristate acetate, okadaic acid, FGF, and fetal bovine serum on Na+/H+ exchange were studied in these transfected cells. Inhibition of basal activity of full-length NHE3 is mediated by CaM at a site C-terminal to amino acid 756; this CaM effect occurs through both kinase dependent and independent mechanisms.

The three-dimensional structure of AT1A was constructed on the basis of a multiple amino acid sequence alignment of seven transmembrane domain receptors and angiotensin II receptors and after the β2 adrenergic receptor model built on the template of the bacteriorhodopsin structure. These data indicated that there are conserved residues that are actively involved in the receptor-ligand interaction. Eleven conserved residues in AT1, His166, Arg167, Glu173, His183, Glu185, Lys199, Trp253, His256, Phe259, Thr260, and Asp263, were targeted individually for site-directed mutation to Ala. Using COS-7 cells transiently expressing these mutated receptors, we found that the binding of angiotensin II was not affected in three of the mutations in the second extracellular loop, whereas the ligand binding affinity was greatly reduced in mutants Lys199→ Ala, Trp253→ Ala, Phe259→ Ala, Asp263→ Ala, and Arg167→ Ala. These amino acid residues appeared to provide binding sites for Ang II. The molecular modeling provided useful structural information for the peptide hormone receptor AT1A.

The Ang II-binding sites for which a specific ligand is displaced by nanomolar concentrations of losartan are now referred to as the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors, and those displaced by CGP42112A or PD123319 are designated as the type 2 (AT2) receptors (4Bumpus M.F.

In general, AT1 receptors mediate most of the responses commonly associated with Ang II, are dithiothreitol sensitive, linked to G-protein, and not displaced by PD123319. AT2 receptors are for the most part losartan insensitive, not inactivated by dithiothreitol, and do not mediate physiological responses involving the second messenger systems commonly associated with AT1 receptors. AT1 receptors are further divided into subtypes which are referred to as “A” and “B” subtypes. AT1A and AT1B show an approximately 95% sequence homology (16Iwai N. Yamano Y. Chaki S. Konishi F.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar), and they were found functionally similar to mammalian AT1 receptors. However, these receptors do not recognize AT1- or AT2-specific nonpeptide antagonists (8Mauzy C.A. Hwang O. Egloff A.M. Wu L.-H. Chung F.-Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The binding site for the AT1-specific antagonist losartan was explored by replacing nonconserved amino acid residues of the rat AT1B receptor with amino acid species at the corresponding positions in the amphibian receptor (27Ji H. Leung M. Zhang Y. Catt K.J. Sandberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16533-16536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The losartan-binding site was defined in several membrane spanning domains of the rat AT1B receptor. A recent study of chimeric human-amphibian Ang II receptors showed that the binding mode for peptide and nonpeptide ligands is rather different and that competitive and insurmountable (noncompetitive) antagonists presumably bind to overlapping but distinct sites located in the sixth and seventh transmembrane (TM) domain (28Henderson R.

The objective of the present studies is to determine the binding sites for Ang II utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and incorporating a computer-assisted receptor modeling approach. The three-dimensional structure of bacteriorhodopsin (bRh), a seven transmembrane domain protein, has been obtained by high-resolution electron cryomicroscopy (28Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A.

By multiple amino acid sequence alignment, highly conserved domains and residues as well as unique sequences for specific ligand-binding sites can be identified. These data permit modeling of the AT1A receptor on the template of an existing model such as that of β2-AR (45Strader C.D. Siegel I.S. Dixon R.A.F. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1825-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 46Strosberg A.D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In prior studies, site-directed mutagenesis in AT1A of a limited number of residues in the transmembrane domains indicated that Lys199 in the fifth transmembrane domain (TM 5th) as a key residue for ligand binding (47Yamano Y. Ohyama K. Chaki S. Guo D.-F. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In order to analyze ligand binding, a model for the docking of Ang II was constructed on the basis of positional and possible functional interactions of a limited number of residues in the receptor model. A hypothesis for the docking mode was then tested on the basis of mutagenesis of several highly conserved amino acid residues considered critical for Ang II binding. We present the homology-based model of the rat AT1A receptor constructed after the model of β2-AR which was used in the present study as a template. We propose a mechanism for docking of a ligand to the AT1A receptor by determining the effects of mutagenesis of critical receptor amino acid residues on the binding affinity.

Information on conserved and non-conserved amino acid sequences were used for homology-based modeling of AT1 on the template of β2-AR model. The modeling was performed using the molecular modeling software SYBYL 5.5 on an UNIX workstation model IRIS/indigo (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mt. View, CA). The extracellular and intracellular loops were constructed, and the restraint minimization was performed as described above for β2-AR. A restrained and full conjugate gradient geometry optimization was then carried out using Discover 2.9. Following this step, loop regions were removed. The full conjugate gradient geometry optimization of the Ang II derivative, (Pen3, Pen5)Ang II (48Spear K.L. Brown M.S. Reinhard E.J. McMahon E.G. Olins G.M. Palomo M.A. Patton D.R. J. Med.

Peptide Res. 1992; 5: 102-105PubMed Google Scholar) (Pen is penicillamine). The conformation of the β-carboxyl and α-amino groups of Asp1 of Ang II was fixed so as to form an intramolecular salt. Docking studies were carried out using SYBYL 5.5 by placing Phe8 of Ang II on Trp253, His6 on Asp263, Arg2 on Asp281, Tyr4 on Arg167 (see “Results and Discussion”). Following the docking of Ang II to the AT1A receptor model, and modifying the backbone and side chain conformation, 100 cycles of the steepest descent optimization were performed followed by about 1000 cycles of the conjugate gradient optimization with strong backbone restraints (1000 iterations) for the AT1A receptor as a routine. Later, the backbone conformation of Ang II reported by Nikiforovich et al.(50Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Eleven conserved residues in AT1A were targeted individually for site-directed mutation to alanine. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) penicillin and streptomycin under 5% CO2, 95% air at 37°C. Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells in 9-cm dishes and split every 3 days. COS-7 cells were transfected with mutated AT1A cDNAs by electroporation as described elsewhere (54Pandy K.N. Pavlou S.N.

Ligand binding studies were performed at 4°C following the procedure reported using 125I-Ang II as an agonist ligand, 125I-EXP985 as an antagonist ligand, and results were analyzed by Scatchard analysis (55White B.A. Bancroft F.C.

COS-7 cells transfected with the receptor cDNAs used in the binding study were collected and washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells (1 × 106 cells) were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and γ-globulin for 30 min at 4°C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-AT1A antibodies against a 15-residue epitope (Lys12-Tyr26) in the N-terminal region of rat AT1A were produced by immunization with the peptide coupled to thyroglobulin. Cells were incubated with the anti-rat AT1A antibodies at 4°C for 60 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with the fluorescence-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment at a 1:50 dilution for 30 min at 4°C, and subjected to an Epics Profile flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm laser beam (Counter Electronics Co., Ltd.). Cells transfected with pcDNAI containing a mutated AT1A cDNA insert expressed immunoreactive rat AT1A as shown in Fig. 2. Expression levels of mutated AT1A receptors were comparable with that of the unmutated AT1A The multiple amino acid sequence alignment of several Ang II receptors in Fig. 1A(5Sasaki K. Yamano Y.

A number of amino acids in the putative TMs are conserved in a large number of GPCRs and probably are of functional or structural importance. The existence and function of conserved residues are best explained if they are situated on the inside of the TM bundle or in an area which is facing other helices. Residues facing the membrane environment can be mutated more easily without affecting the function of the receptor and should be less conserved. The AT1A receptor has two relatively short loops between TM1 and TM2 and also between TM6 and TM7. This was helpful in determining the exact position of the TMs connected to these loops. Additional bent helices by prolines were introduced into TM1 and TM7. Finally, the model of the AT1A receptor TM bundle thus obtained was energy minimized (Discover Force Field) with the backbone fixed with the aim of releasing side chain repulsion. Further minimization with no restriction of the helix bundle (1000 iterations) was performed. These minimizations did not significantly change the relative positions of the TMs. The amine-aromatic interaction, discovered recently in hemoglobin (56Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and repeatedly confirmed in x-ray crystallographic structures of a number of proteins (57Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), were incorporated in the modeling of AT1A. The interaction of amine, amide, or guanido nitrogen with aromatic π electrons within 3-4 Å of the flat face of aromatic ring was computed by molecular orbital calculation according to the Density Functional Theory.2( 2Y. Inoue, Y. Yamamura, N. Nakamura, Y. Yamano, K. Ohyama, T. Inagami, A. Scheiner, M. Wrinn, and J. Andzelm, manuscript in preparation.) Since the side chain of a lysyl residue is long, the ε-amino group of Lys199 (TM5), which is important for ligand binding (Table I), might not be located near the outer surface. Frequently, there are aromatic amino acid residues surrounding the ionic bridge formed between GPCRs and their ligands (30Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 3. Tryptophyl residues are found in TM4, 6, and 7 in most GPCRs (37Kobilka B.K. Dixson R.A.F. Frielle T. Dohlman H.G.

Incubation of rat hepatocytes with [14C]- or [3H]serine labeled the long-chain base backbones of mainly ceramide and sphingomyelin. Most of the labeled sphingolipids were associated with the cells; however, 1-5% (the majority of which was ceramide) was released into the medium as part of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Since this is the first report that lipoproteins contain ceramide, lipoproteins were isolated from rat plasma, and the ceramide contents were (per mg of protein): 6.5 nmol for VLDL (d < 1.018), 0.6 nmol for low density lipoproteins (1.018 < d < 1.063), 0.2 nmol for high density lipoproteins (1.063 < d < 1.18), and 0.1 nmol for the albumin fraction; the lipoproteins also contained 0.1-0.4 nmol of free sphingosine/mg of protein. A number of factors affected the secretion of radiolabeled sphingolipids: 1) addition of palmitic acid, but not stearic or oleic acid, enhanced secretion due to an increase in long-chain base synthesis de novo. 2) Choline deficiency caused a 42% reduction in the secretion of radiolabeled sphingomyelin, but this was due to an effect on VLDL secretion rather than a decrease in sphingolipid synthesis. Removal of choline was examined because previous studies (Yao, Z. M., and Vance, D. E.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2998-3004) have shown that choline deficiencies depress [Abstract] phosphatidylcholine synthesis and lipoprotein secretion. 3) Incubation of the cells with fumonisin B1, a mycotoxin inhibitor of sphinganine (sphingosine) N-acyltransferase, reduced overall sphingolipid synthesis and secretion by 90%, but had no effect on the secretion of apoB, phosphatidylcholine, or cholesterol. All together, these findings demonstrate that rat hepatocytes synthesize ceramide and sphingomyelin de novo and incorporate them into both cellular membranes and secreted VLDL, but normal sphingolipid synthesis is not required for lipoprotein secretion.

All together, these findings demonstrate that rat hepatocytes synthesize ceramide and sphingomyelin de novo and incorporate them into both cellular membranes and secreted VLDL, but normal sphingolipid synthesis is not required for lipoprotein secretion. Sphingolipids are constituents of cellular membranes, lipoproteins, secretions such as lung surfactant and milk, and the water barrier of skin (Sweeley, 1991Sweeley C.C. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 327-361Google Scholar). They are composed of a long-chain (sphingoid) base with an amide-linked fatty acid and, except in the case of free ceramide, polar headgroups such as phosphorylcholine (for sphingomyelin) or carbohydrates (for cerebrosides, gangliosides, and other complex glycolipids). Sphingolipids have a wide range of functions, from structural roles to modulation of growth factor receptors and signal transduction pathways (for reviews see Bell et al., 1993Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. Merrill Jr., A.H. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25 (26, 334 pp.): 339Google Scholar). There have been relatively few studies of the de novo biosynthesis of the lipid backbones of sphingolipids in intact cells and how this may relate to the emerging picture of these compounds as bioactive species. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins with the synthesis of 3-ketosphinganine by condensation of serine and a fatty acyl-CoA, followed by reduction of the keto group using NADPH (producing sphinganine) and addition of an amide-linked fatty acid (Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting N-acylsphinganines (dihydroceramides) are further metabolized to ceramides (i.e. containing a 4,5-trans-double bond in the sphingosine group of the ceramide) (Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Rother et al., 1992Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with the various headgroups (for reviews of sphingolipid metabolism, see Merrill and Jones, 1990Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar; Sweeley, 1991Sweeley C.C. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5341-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The de novo pathway can be followed by incubation of cells with [14C]serine (or labeled palmitic acid) and incorporation of label in the sphinganine and sphingosine backbones of various sphingolipids (Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flux through this pathway is affected by the concentration of serine and palmitate in the culture media (Merrill et al., 1988aMerrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); therefore, precursor availability appears to be one of the determinants of the rate of sphingolipid biosynthesis de novo (Merrill and Jones, 1990Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Regulation also appears to involve inhibition by free sphingosine, which decreases the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (Van Echten et al., 1990Van Echten G. Birk R. Brenner-Weiss G. Schmidt R.R. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9333-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin and some glycolipids are major constituents of plasma (Vance et al., 1975Vance D.E. Krivit W. Sweeley C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8119-8125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and circulating lipoproteins (see review by Merrill and Jones, 1990Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Some gangliosides are known to be shed by tumors and to become associated with serum lipoproteins (Valentino and Ladisch, 1992Valentino L.A. Ladisch S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 810-814PubMed Google Scholar) and gangliosides appear in liver perfusates (Kivatinitz et al., 1992Kivatinitz S.C. Favini P. Ghidoni R. Biochem. Int. 1992; 26: 821-829PubMed Google Scholar); nonetheless it is not yet known if sphingolipids that are synthesized by liver are secreted or merely bind to lipoproteins while they are in circulation. Sphingolipid synthesis from [14C]serine has been investigated using rat hepatocytes and a liver cell line (Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, this study did not characterize the nature of the complex sphingolipids that were made, nor whether they were secreted from the hepatocytes with lipoproteins. Hence, the goals of this investigation were to provide this basic information about the composition and fate of the sphingolipids made de novo by rat hepatocytes and to explore the implications of these findings for the regulation of sphingolipid (and lipoprotein) biosynthesis and secretion. Media for cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; collagenase (Type IV), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and other tissue culture reagents were obtained from Sigma. The [U-14C]serine (55 mCi/mmol) and [3H]serine (10-30 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham (United Kingdom or Arlington Heights, IL); [U-14C]serine (135 mCi/mmol) was also obtained from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA) and diluted to ca 50 mCi/mmol with unlabeled serine. [3H]Sphingosine was a gift from DuPont NEN and was purified by TLC before use (Merrill and Wang, 1992Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin, ceramide, fatty acids, fatty acyl-CoA, and the other lipid standards were purchased from Sigma. Fumonisin B1 was obtained from the suppliers described previously (Wang et al., 1991Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol.

Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viabilities were >90% as assessed by the exclusion of 0.2% trypan blue. The incubations were conducted essentially as described previously (Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J.

When fatty acids were added to the cells, they were first prepared as complexes with fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) by mixing the fatty acid in ethanol with BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by dialysis overnight against PBS.

Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cells were scraped from the dishes, added to glass test tubes, and 25 μg of carrier sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, ceramide, and sphingosine) were added. After extracting the lipids, aliquots were acid hydrolyzed to determine the total sphingolipids by analysis of the radiolabel in sphingosine and sphinganine (Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ceramide (after separation by silica gel TLC in diethyl ether:methanol, 99:1, v/v), and sphingomyelin (after TLC in CHCl3:methanol:acetic acid:water, 56:30:4:2, v/v). The amount of radiolabel was corrected using an estimate for quenching by the silica gel that was obtained by adding a known amount of radiolabel to the chromatogram. Analyses of the radiolabel in long-chain base backbones of ceramide and sphingomyelin according to Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol.

To compare the composition of the ceramides that were produced by the cells versus those released into the medium, cells were labeled overnight with 0.1 mCi of [3H]serine/dish, then the media from 10 dishes were pooled, and the cells were scraped from each dish. The medium was centrifuged to remove dislodged cells and analyzed without further purification, because essentially all of the radiolabeled sphingolipids in the medium were found to be associated with lipoproteins (as will be shown under “Results”). The lipids in the cells and medium were extracted, base-hydrolyzed in 0.5 N KOH in methanol for 1 h at 37°C, and the ceramides purified by preparative TLC using silica gel plates and the solvent system diethyl ether:methanol (99:1, v/v). To recover the ceramides, silica from the appropriate region of the TLC plates was scraped into test tubes and extracted with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) followed by 1 ml of methanol. The [3H]ceramide samples were analyzed by HPLC using a Waters C18-μBondapak column and acetonitrile:ethanol (60:40, v/v) as the mobile phase. The radiolabel was detected using a β-Ram flow-through monitor. To produce [3H]ceramides as standards for the HPLC analyses, various fatty acyl-CoAs were incubated with [3H]sphingosine as described by Merrill and Wang, 1992Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, and the products were analyzed as described above (the retention times of the various N-acyl-[3H]sphingosines are given in Fig. 5). To determine the radiolabel in lipoproteins, the culture medium was removed, centrifuged for several minutes at 8,000 × g to remove dislodged cells, then subjected to centrifugation in a sucrose gradient (Yao and Vance, 1988Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or sequential centrifugations at different densities (Havel et al., 1955Havel R. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J.

Very low density (VLDL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins were isolated from rat plasma by the same method using the density ranges d < 1.018 g/ml for VLDL, 1.018 < d < 1.063 for LDL, and 1.063 < d < 1.18 for HDL. The lipids were extracted, separated by TLC, and analyzed for radiolabel (Merrill and Wang, 1986Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or mass by HPLC (Merrill et al., 1988bMerrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal.

To determine the effect of fumonisin B1 on the secretion of apoB, hepatocytes were isolated as described above and on the following morning changed to new medium minus serum and with or without 10 μM fumonisin B1. After 8 and 24 h, the medium was removed, centrifuged to remove debris, and the apoB was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described in Yao and Vance, 1988Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Yao and Vance, 1990Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An earlier study (Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) showed that hepatocytes incorporate [14C]serine into sphingolipids without accumulation of detectable amounts of the free long-chain base intermediates. The goals of this investigation were to characterize the complex sphingolipids that are made using these newly synthesized long-chain bases, to determine if hepatocytes release newly made sphingolipids as part of secreted lipoproteins, and to identify some of the factors that regulate the de novo biosynthesis and secretion of sphingolipids. The time course of sphingolipid formation from [14C]serine is given in Fig. 1. For the first 6 h, essentially all of the radiolabel could be accounted for by ceramide and sphingomyelin. Sphingosine was the major long-chain base of the total and individual sphingolipids, and this did not vary with time or any of the treatments in this study (except fumonisin addition); therefore, the results are presented as the total long-chain bases, which is the sum of radiolabel in sphingosine and sphinganine. After 4 h, ceramide appears to reach a steady state; whereas, the labeling of sphingomyelin and other complex sphingolipids continued for at least 12 h (Fig. 1A). Addition of an unlabeled serine “chase” at 4 h (Fig. 1B) stopped the formation of labeled sphingomyelin and total sphingolipids. That [14C]ceramide remained relatively constant during both continuous labeling and the chase implies that ceramide is not only an intermediate in the formation of more complex sphingolipids, but also, itself a relatively significant product of the de novo biosynthetic pathway. Based on the specific activity of the added [14C]serine, the cellular level of [14C]ceramide is at least 0.3 nmol/mg of protein after 4 h of labeling. A more exact estimate of the amount of [14C]ceramide is precluded by the dilution of the [14C]serine by serine made from various unlabeled precursors, such as glycine (via serine hydroxymethyltransferase) and glucose (via intermediates of glycolysis). In fact, the equilibration of serine and glycine was so rapid that almost as many disintegrations/min were incorporated into sphingolipids when hepatocytes were incubated with [14C]glycine of a comparable specific activity (data not shown). By 12 h, about one-third of the radiolabel was distributed among many minor bands that were too faint to be readily distinguished. When 10-fold higher amounts of [14C]serine (100 μCi/dish) were used (not shown), one of these could be identified as lactosylceramide, but most of these products were still too faint to be analyzed readily. It is known that the glycolipid pattern changes while rat hepatocytes are in culture (Phillips et al., 1985Phillips J. Schulze-Specking A. Rump J.A. Decker K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); therefore, this study focused on the incorporation of [14C]serine into ceramide, sphingomyelin, and total sphingolipids. The majority of the radiolabeled sphingolipids was recovered with the cells; however, from 1 to 5% appeared in the culture medium (Fig. 2). The predominant sphingolipid in the medium was [14C]ceramide (Fig. 2B). To determine the nature of the particles that contain these radiolabeled sphingolipids, cells were incubated with [3H]serine to increase the amount of label in the medium. After 12 h, the medium was removed, centrifuged to remove cells, and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3). The majority of the radiolabel in both total sphingolipids and sphingomyelin was recovered in the fractions with d < 1.055, which contains VLDL. A small amount (primarily sphingomyelin) was in the most dense fractions, which contain albumin. A similar analysis was conducted with both [14C]serine (Fig. 4, left panel) and [3H]serine (Fig. 4, right panel) and separation of the lipoproteins by sequential centrifugation of the medium at different densities achieved by addition of KBr. The majority of the radiolabel (>75%) was recovered with the VLDL fractions. These findings establish that most of the newly made sphingolipids that are released from the hepatocytes are associated with VLDL rather than membrane fragments or HDL. The selective association with VLDL makes it likely that these sphingolipids are secreted as part of nascent VLDL. To determine if the ceramides secreted by the hepatocytes are similar in structure to the ones found in the cells, the ceramide fraction was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 5). The HPLC profiles for the cells (middle panel) and medium (lower panel) are generally similar, with most of the radiolabel eluting in the vicinity of ceramides with arachidic (C20), behenic (C22), and lignoceric (C24) acids (the multiple peaks eluting after C20 may be due to unsaturation of the fatty acid or differences in the long-chain base). This composition appears reasonable, because these chain lengths are present in >60% of the sphingomyelins from liver (Fex, 1971Fex G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 231: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There are two possible differences between the cells and medium: 1) N-palmitoyl-(C16) and N-stearoyl-(C18) sphingosines were evident in the cells but were not seen in the medium, although the amounts of total radiolabel in the medium may have been too low for these minor species to be detected, and 2) the ceramide(s) in the vicinity of N-lignoceroyl-sphingosine (C24) eluted slightly earlier for the medium than for the cells. As far as we are aware, ceramide has not been previously reported to be a constituent of lipoproteins; therefore, we analyzed the ceramide amounts in lipoproteins isolated from rat plasma to determine if the release of labeled ceramide from hepatocytes is an artifact of cell culture. As shown in Table I, all of the lipoprotein fractions contain ceramide; however, it is the most predominant species (i.e. about 50% of the total sphingolipid) in the lipoproteins with d < 1.018 g/ml. Sphingomyelin accounted for most of the sphingolipid in LDL and HDL, which agrees with the higher percentages of sphingomyelin in the phospholipids of LDL (6.5 versus 49.7% phosphatidylcholine) and HDL (6.2 versus 59.1% phosphatidylcholine) compared to VLDL (4.2 versus 75.5% phosphatidylcholine) (Chapman, 1986Chapman M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 70-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Small amounts of free sphingosine (Table I) were also detected in each lipoprotein fraction.Table ISphingolipid content of rat lipoproteins Preliminary analyses were also conducted with lymph that had been collected from rats that had an intestinal lymph fistula and given to us by Dr. Patrick Tso (Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport, LA). The lymph contained approximately 1 nmol of total sphingolipids/ml, of which about 40% was ceramide. Therefore, these analyses establish that ceramide is one of the neutral lipid components of very low density lipoproteins as well as other lipoproteins to a lesser extent. Because the addition of palmitic acid to isolated hepatocytes has been shown to increase the incorporation of [14C]serine into sphingolipids in short term studies (Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this parameter was examined also for these studies of hepatocytes over longer time courses. Addition of palmitic acid as the BSA complex increased total sphingolipid and sphingomyelin labeling by about 2-fold when added at a palmitic acid:BSA ratio (mol:mol) of 2:1 (Fig. 6, left panel). Fatty acid-free BSA caused some stimulation (25%), and this was not seen if BSA was provided as the 1:1 complex with oleic acid. Stearic acid (at a 2:1 molar ratio with BSA) had about the same effect as BSA alone. This selectivity in the stimulation of long-chain base biosynthesis by fatty acids has been attributed to the substrate specificity of the first enzyme of sphingolipid biosynthesis (serine palmitoyltransferase) for saturated fatty acyl-CoAs of 16 ± 1 carbon atoms (Merrill et al., 1988aMerrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Messmer et al., 1989Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another consequence of adding fatty acids to the cells was a reduction (by about half) in the incorporation of label from [14C]serine into fatty acids (similar results were obtained with palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids) (data not shown). Because palmitic acid increases overall sphingolipid labeling, its effect on the secretion of total sphingolipids and ceramide was determined for the pooled lipoproteins secreted by hepatocytes incubated with [14C]serine (Fig. 6, right panel). When the hepatocytes were incubated with palmitate:BSA, the radiolabel in secreted sphingolipids was almost 2-fold higher than when BSA was added alone or when oleate:BSA was added. Ceramide labeling was also approximately 2-fold higher when palmitic acid was added than for oleic acid or BSA alone. Therefore, the availability of this precursor of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis also affects the amount of secreted sphingolipid. Vance and co-workers (Yao and Vance, 1988Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Yao and Vance, 1990Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. Biochem.

Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have shown that the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine is restricted by feeding rats diets deficient in choline and culturing the hepatocytes in medium free of choline and methionine and that this restricts lipoprotein secretion by hepatocytes. Because the headgroup of sphingomyelin is thought to be derived mainly from phosphatidylcholine (as reviewed in Merrill and Jones, 1990Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), the effects of choline deficiency on sphingolipid biosynthesis was determined (Table II). In both of the experiments that were conducted, the overall sphingolipid labeling was not affected significantly by incubation of the hepatocytes with or without choline and methionine (Table II).Table IISphingolipid biosynthesis by hepatocytes from choline deficient rats Somewhat surprisingly, there was an approximately 2-fold increase in the appearance of radiolabel in sphingomyelin when choline was restricted. It is possible that this is arising from a second pathway that has been proposed for sphingomyelin synthesis (Fig. 7) in which ceramide is first converted to ceramide phosphorylethanolamine (via transfer of the headgroup from phosphatidylethanolamine) (Muehlenberg et al., 1972Muehlenberg B.A. Sribney M. Duffe M.K. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; Malgat et al., 1986Malgat M. Maurice A. Baraud J. J.

Chem. 1974; 249: 1506-1512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver has been reported to contain ceramide phosphorylethanolamine (Muehlenberg et al., 1972Muehlenberg B.A. Sribney M. Duffe M.K. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and we have observed that [14C]serine is incorporated into a product with the same mobility on thin-layer chromatography as ceramide phosphorylethanolamine (Fig. 7). The amounts were too small for definitive structural identification; however, this compound should be borne in mind for future study. In contrast to the lack of a reduction on total sphingolipid synthesis, the secretion of radiolabeled sphingolipids was reduced by about half in choline deficiency (Table II), which is similar to the reduction in VLDL secretion in this model (Yao and Vance, 1988Yao Z.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988"

Competitive antagonism and non-use dependence are consistent with picrotoxin binding to a site in the extracellular domain. The mutations Arg → Leu or Arg → Gln at residue 271 of the glycine receptor α1 subunit, which are both associated with human startle disease, have previously been demonstrated to disrupt the transduction process between agonist binding and channel activation. We show here that these mutations also transform picrotoxin from an allosterically acting competitive antagonist to an allosteric potentiator at low (0.01-3 μM) concentrations and to a noncompetitive antagonist at higher (≥3 μM) concentrations. This demonstrates that arginine 271 is involved in the transduction process between picrotoxin binding and its mechanism of action. Thus, the allosteric transduction pathways of both agonists and antagonists converge at a common residue prior to the activation gate of the channel, suggesting that this residue may act as an integration point for information from various extracellular ligand binding sites.

Subunits of the different receptor types share common structural components, including an N-terminal extracellular domain, which contains the ligand-binding sites, and four membrane-spanning domains (M1-M4), the second of which lines the pore and contains residues responsible for channel activation, desensitization, ionic selectivity, and the binding of noncompetitive channel blockers (8.Devillers-Thiéry A.

The dominant human neurological disorder, startle disease, is caused by missense mutations that lead to the Arg at position 271 (Arg-271) of the human GlyR α1 subunit being converted to either a Leu or a Gln (11.Shiang R.

This residue lies at the extracellular border of the M2 domain, and these mutations caused a reduction in the magnitude of glycine-gated currents by both decreasing glycine sensitivity (13.Rajendra S.

They also converted taurine and β-alanine from agonists into competitive antagonists, indicating that Arg-271 is a crucial residue in controlling agonist signal transduction (15.Rajendra S.

The mutations of Arg-271 had no effect on the binding of the competitive antagonist, strychnine (13.Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol.

In the homologous nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR), a series of antagonists has been identified that “competitively” antagonizes agonist-induced responses by interacting allosterically with residues within the M2 domain to stabilize a desensitized state (18.Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiéry A. Revah F. Galzi J.L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, no glycinergic antagonists have yet been shown to act in this way. The aim of the present study was to establish whether the actions of GlyR antagonists may also be functionally coupled via the same residue. The plant alkaloid, picrotoxin, is an antagonist of both GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) and GlyRs (19.Curtis D.R. Johnston G.A.R. Simpson L.L. Curtis D.R. Neuropoisons: Their Pathological Actions.Vol II poisons of plant origin. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1974: 207-248Google Scholar). A recent study (20.Pribilla I. Takagi T. Langosch D. Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), which analyzed recombinant GlyRs mutated throughout the M2 domain, concluded that picrotoxin bound to a site within the channel pore and acted as a channel blocker. In this study, we demonstrate that the action of picrotoxin on the WT GlyR is competitive and displays no use dependence. These properties, which contrast directly with those of picrotoxin on the GABAAR, are not readily reconciled with a binding site within the pore (8.Devillers-Thiéry A. Galzi J.L. Eiselé J.L. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 21.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Assoc., Sunderland, MA1992: 390-422Google Scholar). We then show that the functional coupling of picrotoxin is fundamentally altered by the mutations of Arg-271. The results indicate that this residue is involved in the transduction of information from a competitive antagonist binding site to at least one domain controlling ion channel function of the GlyR. Mutations in the cDNA encoding the human GlyR α1 subunit were constructed using the oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis method (22.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene(Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing the cDNA clones. Plasmid DNA encoding both wild-type or mutated α1 subunits was transiently transfected into exponentially growing human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) via the method of Chen and Okayama (23.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar) using the vector pCIS2 (24.Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. Huang M. Virology. 1989; 171: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 24 h prior to transfection in Eagle's minimum essential medium in Hank's salts, supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were washed twice, placed in fresh culture medium, and used within 72 h. Coverslips containing cultured transfected cells were transferred into a small volume (2 ml) recording chamber, which was continually perfused with a modified Ringer's solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Glycine-gated currents were measured using whole cell recording techniques (25.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15119) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate hemeatocrit tubing (Vitrex, Modulohm, Denmark) and had tip resistances of 1-4 megaohms when filled with the standard intracellular solution containing 145 mM CsCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, with CsOH. Picrotoxin, picrotoxinin, and picrotin (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with distilled water to a 10 mM stock solution, with at a dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 5%. Stocks were stored frozen for up to 2 months, and freshly thawed aliquots were used on each experimental day. Membrane currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier and PClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) from cells voltage-clamped at −60 mV, corrected for liquid junction potentials (26.Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The amplifier electronic series resistance compensation was used to compensate for at least 50% of the series resistance error. Experiments were performed at room temperature (18-22°C). Solution exchanges were performed using a parallel array of microtubular barrels through which solutions were gravity-fed into the recording chamber. Barrel mouths were positioned under visual control to within 100 μm of target cells, and rapid complete solution exchange was effected by moving the barrels with a manually operated micromanipulator. For the experiments where a constant rate of solution exchange was required for different pairs of solutions (e.g. see Fig. 2, below), solutions were always chosen to flow through the same pair of adjacently situated barrels. The voltage sensitivity of the picrotoxin-induced inhibition was examined using an approximately half-inhibiting (30 μM) concentration of picrotoxin in the presence of a saturating (1 mM) concentration of glycine. An example of a typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1A, where picrotoxin inhibition was measured at voltages from −70 to +50 mV in 20-mV steps. The current-voltage relationships derived from this experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. It is clear that there is no significant voltage-dependence of picrotoxin inhibition over this voltage range. Similar results were found in each of four cells using this voltage clamp procedure and in six other cells using digitally-generated voltage ramps from −90 to +90 mV (data not shown). In GABAARs, the rate of onset and washout of the picrotoxin-induced inhibition is dramatically enhanced in the presence of GABA (27.Yakushiji T. Tokutomi N. Akaike N. Carpenter D.O. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28.Inoue M. Akaike N. Neurosci. Res. 1988; 5: 380-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29.Newland C.F.

The possible use dependence of picrotoxin on GlyRs was examined using several strategies. When 100 μM picrotoxin was co-applied with 1 mM glycine, a brief transient peak current was elicited, which decayed rapidly (within 300 ms) to a constant steady-state level, with no evidence for a slowly-developing inhibitory component (Fig. 2A, filledcircle). A 1-s preexposure to picrotoxin abolished this spike, but it did not affect the steady-state inhibition level (n = 5; data not shown). When picrotoxin was subsequently removed in the maintained presence of glycine, the rate of channel reactivation was significantly slower (Fig. 2A, filledcircle) than when glycine was applied in the absence of picrotoxin preexposure (Fig. 2A, hollowcircle). To facilitate this comparison, the activation segments of each trace are normalized, superimposed, and expanded in Fig. 2C. In a total of 5 cells, the time to half-maximal activation of glycine-gated currents without picrotoxin preexposure was significantly increased after a 1.5-s preexposure to picrotoxin (Fig. 2D). Details of the statistical analysis used to assess significance are given in the legend to Fig. 2. Thus, the reduced rate of current activation following washout of picrotoxin may be used as an assay of the dissociation of picrotoxin from its receptor. By using a similar strategy as outlined in Fig. 2A, we examined whether picrotoxin can bind efficiently in the absence of glycine. An example of such an experiment is shown in Fig. 2B, where preexposure of cells to 100 μM picrotoxin in the absence of glycine was followed by the simultaneous removal of picrotoxin and application of 1 mM glycine. As shown in Fig. 2D, the time to half-activation was not significantly different from the recovery time when picrotoxin was co-applied with glycine. For the current traces displayed in Fig. 2, A and B, this is illustrated by the ability to superimpose all respective current activation segments in Fig. 2C. Thus, picrotoxin binding is independent of the presence of glycine. In a second approach to check for possible use dependence, we examined whether repeated glycine applications in the constant presence of picrotoxin (29.Newland C.F. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 447: 191-213Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) could cause a progressive accumulation of inhibition. An example of an experiment designed to test this is shown in Fig. 3A, where eight successive 2-s applications of glycine caused virtually no time-dependent accumulation of inhibition. Pooled results from four cells, displayed in Fig. 3B, confirm this trend. Hence, from these experiments, it may be concluded that picrotoxin binding is not dependent on the presence of glycine. We examined the picrotoxin-induced inhibition of glycine-gated currents in WT GlyRs to determine whether or not it was a competitive antagonist. Picrotoxin inhibitory dose-response curves were measured in the presence of both a saturating concentration (1 mM) and an approximately half-saturating concentration (30 μM) of glycine. An example of an inhibitory dose-response for 30 μM picrotoxin is shown in Fig. 4A. In Fig. 4B, picrotoxin dose responses were averaged from five cells in 30 μM glycine (squares) and for six other cells in 1 mM glycine (circles). Averaged results for the picrotoxin half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and Hill coefficients are presented in Table I, and -fold increases in IC50s are shown in parentheses. The increased glycine concentration resulted in an 8.1-fold increase in the IC50 for picrotoxin, clearly revealing a strong competition between glycine and picrotoxin. To determine whether the picrotoxin antagonism was completely or partially competitive, the degree of inhibition induced by 10 μM picrotoxin was measured at glycine concentrations of 10, 30, 100, and 1000 μM. As shown in Fig. 5A, at 10 μM glycine, picrotoxin inhibition was complete, and this was progressively overcome as the glycine concentration was increased to 1 mM. Averaged results from five cells, each recorded in both 0 and 10 μM picrotoxin, are displayed in Fig. 5B as circles andsquares, respectively. In the absence of picrotoxin, the glycine half-maximal activation concentration (EC50) was 25 ± 3 μM (±S.E., n = 5) with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 ± 0.1, and in the same five cells in the presence of 10 μM picrotoxin, the EC50 increased approximately 4-fold to 95 ± 16, while the Hill coefficient (1.6 ± 0.1) was not significantly changed. These results indicate that picrotoxin acts purely as a competitive antagonist of glycine in WT GlyRs.Table IPicrotoxin inhibition of channel activation of wild-type and mutated GlyRsTable IPicrotoxin inhibition of channel activation of wild-type and mutated GlyRsFigure 5:Inhibition induced by 10 μM picrotoxin in WT GlyRs is progressively overcome by increasing the glycine concentration. A, a series of current traces from one cell showing that the inhibition induced by 10 μM picrotoxin is overcome by increasing the glycine concentration from 10 μM to 1 mM. Apparent concentration-dependent differences in picrotoxin onset kinetics may be complicated by chloride shift effects (15.Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R.

All data were recorded from the same five cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Picrotoxin is an equimolar mixture of picrotoxinin and picrotin, of which only picrotoxinin is active in antagonizing the GABAAR (19.Curtis D.R. Johnston G.A.R. Simpson L.L. Curtis D.R. Neuropoisons: Their Pathological Actions.Vol II poisons of plant origin. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1974: 207-248Google Scholar). The relative potencies of picrotoxinin and picrotin have not been previously tested on the GlyR. As seen in Fig. 6A, both picrotin and picrotoxinin were similar in their ability to antagonize the currents activated by 1 mM glycine, but each was less efficacious than picrotoxin. In Fig. 6B, averaged inhibitory dose responses are displayed for both picrotin (uprighttriangles) and picrotoxinin (invertedtriangles), together with the results for picrotoxin (hollowcircles) replotted from Fig. 4B. The respective IC50 values and Hill coefficients are shown in Table II. There is clearly no significant difference in relative efficacies of picrotin and picrotoxinin in inhibiting the glycine-induced current (unpaired t test, p > 0.05). To reconstitute the effect of picrotoxin from the sum of its constituents, the combined inhibitory dose response of picrotin and picrotoxinin was calculated by multiplying together the fractional currents remaining after exposure to each constituent at each concentration. These points were then fitted by the curve shown as a dashedline in Fig. 6B. This curve had an IC50 and Hill coefficient as given in Table II, which was not significantly different from the averaged values for picrotoxin (unpaired t test, p > 0.05).Table IIRelative potencies of picrotoxin, picrotoxinin, and picrotin in inhibiting the WT GlyRTable IIRelative potencies of picrotoxin, picrotoxinin, and picrotin in inhibiting the WT GlyR When tested on GlyRs expressing either of the two startle disease mutations, Arg-271 → Leu (R271L) or Arg-271 → Gln (R271Q), picrotoxin caused both a potentiation and an inhibition of glycine-gated currents in the presence of a submaximal (5 mM) glycine concentration. Examples of picrotoxin dose responses for both mutant receptors are shown in Fig. 7A. At a picrotoxin concentration of 1 μM, only a potentiation was observed. At 3 μM, the potentiation was rendered transient by the superposition of a slowly developing inhibition. At higher picrotoxin concentrations (10 and 30 μM), only a concentration-dependent inhibition was observed. Thus, in both mutated GlyRs, picrotoxin appeared to exert two opposite functions, which overlapped at 3 μM. The potentiation was not due to picrotoxin acting as an agonist. As shown in Fig. 7B, for both the R271L and R271Q GlyRs, application of 0.3 μM picrotoxin alone was not sufficient to activate a current, although when applied with 5 mM glycine it was able to strongly potentiate the glycine-gated current. This was observed in each of five cells expressing each mutant receptor. Accordingly, at low concentrations, picrotoxin acts as an allosteric potentiator of glycine-gated currents. This contrasts with the WT GlyR, where at a half-maximal glycine concentration (30 μM) and a subthreshold picrotoxin concentration (0.3 μM), no potentiation was ever observed (Fig. 4). We sought to establish whether the potentiating and inhibitory effects of picrotoxin were mediated through binding sites with different characteristics. As a first approach, we investigated whether both effects were competitive with glycine. To isolate the potentiating from the inhibitory effects, a picrotoxin concentration of 0.3 μM was used, as it is below the threshold for inhibition. The potentiation, expressed as a percentage of the maximum activable current, was measured at glycine concentrations of 5, 20, and 100 mM. A concentration of 5 mM is approximately half-saturating, whereas a 100 mM concentration is saturating. The EC50 for glycine activation in the R271L GlyR is 6.7 mM and in the R271Q GlyR is 12 mM (13.Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18739-18742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8A, the picrotoxin-induced potentiation was substantial at 5 mM, but in both mutants, GlyR was progressively completely diminished by 100 mM glycine. The percentage current increases averaged from three cells expressing the R271L and R271Q GlyRs are displayed in Fig. 8B. These results indicate that the picrotoxin-induced potentiation is the result of a decrease in the glycine EC50, with no change to the maximum peak current amplitude. To investigate the potentiation further, the dose response of the picrotoxin-induced potentiation was examined in both mutant GlyRs, using picrotoxin concentrations between 0.01 and 3 μM. A constant glycine concentration of 5 mM was used throughout. An example of a dose-response curve for a R271Q GlyR is given in Fig. 9A. It displayed a clear bell-shaped concentration dependence, and the rising and falling phases are presented in separate panels for clarity. At 3 μM, the slow onset inhibitory effect can also be observed. The averaged dose-responses measured in four cells expressing R271Q GlyRs are shown in Fig. 9B (squares), where the percentage current increase is displayed relative to the mean current amplitude before picrotoxin application. From this figure, it can be seen that the threshold for potentiation occurs at less than 0.01 μM picrotoxin, reaches a maximum near 0.3 μM and is substantially diminished by 3 μM. The averaged dose-response was also measured from 4 cells expressing the R271L GlyR (Fig. 9B, circles). This displayed a similar maximal potentiation but peaked at the lower picrotoxin concentration of 0.1 μM. The inhibitory effect of picrotoxin was also examined for possible competition with glycine. Picrotoxin inhibitory dose responses were measured using glycine concentrations of 5 and 100 mM, and picrotoxin concentrations of 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM. Sample traces displaying the picrotoxin-induced inhibiton in both mutant GlyRs are shown for both 100 and 5 mM glycine in Fig. 10A (upper and lowerpanels), respectively. Although the inhibition in response to 30 and 10 μM picrotoxin appeared similar for both 5 and 100 mM glycine in both mutant GlyRs, using 3 μM picrotoxin resulted in an inhibition at 100 mM glycine, but a potentiation at 5 mM glycine. This is expected due to the glycine-dependence of the potentiation (Fig. 8) and to the overlap between potentiation and inhibition at 3 μM picrotoxin (e.g.Fig. 7A and 9A). Accordingly, at 5 mM glycine, longer (5 s) exposures to 3 μM picrotoxin were required for the picrotoxin-induced inhibition to reach a steady state level (Fig. 7A). Picrotoxin inhibitory dose responses were measured in five cells, each expressing R271L and R271Q GlyRs, and averaged results are shown in Fig. 10B for both 100 mM glycine (circles) and 5 mM glycine (squares). The respective picrotoxin IC50s and Hill coefficients are given in Table II, and -fold increases between half-maximal and maximal glycine concentrations are indicated by numbers in parentheses. Whereas the WT GlyR showed an 8.1-fold increase in the IC50 over this range, there was no significant change (unpaired t test; p > 0.05) in the corresponding values for either of the mutant GlyRs. Hence, picrotoxin is converted from a competitive antagonist of the WT GlyR to a noncompetitive antagonist of both the R271L and R271Q GlyRs. As described above (Table I), both picrotoxinin and picrotin were equally efficacious in antagonizing the WT GlyR. In an attempt to pharmacologically differentiate between the potentiating and inhibitory effects of picrotoxin in the R271L and R271Q GlyRs, the efficacies of both picrotoxinin and picrotin were evaluated on both response types. To examine potentiation in the absence of inhibition, a 5 mM concentration of glycine was used with picrotoxin, picrotoxinin, and picrotin at concentrations of 0.1 μM. To examine inhibition in the absence of potentiation, a 100 mM glycine concentration was used with a 30 μM concentration of each ligand. The efficacies of the three compounds in inhibiting the R271L and R271Q GlyRs were averaged from three cells each, and the results are summarized in Table III. In both mutant GlyRs there was no significant difference in the inhibition produced by picrotin or picrotoxinin, but as expected, the inhibition produced by picrotoxin was significantly stronger (paired t test; p < 0.05). Picrotoxinin and picrotin were also equally efficacious in potentiating glycine-activated currents. As shown in Table III, in four cells expressing the R271L GlyR and in five cells expressing the R271Q GlyR, there was no significant difference (paired t test) in the amount of potentiation induced by either component.Table IIIRelative efficacies of picrotoxinin and picrotin in inducing potentiation and inhibition in R271L and R271Q GlyRs Although picrotoxin is known to act as a potent antagonist of homomeric GlyRs (20.Pribilla I.

Rat neurogranin shares an 18-amino acid sequence with B-50 which comprises the single PKC phosphorylation site (the only phosphorylation site reported) and the atypical calmodulin binding domain (26Baudier J.

Taking advantage of this sequence identity in B-50 and neurogranin, we developed a quantitative procedure to precipitate B-50 and neurogranin from a single hippocampal slice, thus enabling us to monitor the phosphorylation state of a pre- and postsynaptic PKC substrate simultaneously. We show that phosphorylation of both PKC substrates is increased in a narrow time window around 60 min after LTP induction and that the increase in B-50 phosphorylation precedes that of neurogranin phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTransversal hippocampal slices (450 μm) were made from hippocampi from male Wistar rats (100-120 g) on a McIlwain tissue-chopper, collected in Petri dishes containing constantly gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 phosphate-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (phosphate-free ACSF: NaCl, 124 mM; KCl, 4.5 mM; MgSO4, 1.3 mM; glucose, 10 mM; NaHCO3, 20 mM; and CaCl2, 2.5 mM, pH 7.4) and stored at room temperature until the start of the experiments.Three hippocampal slices from three different rats were transferred to tubes containing 900 μl of phosphate-free ACSF at 30°C. After 30 min, 100 μCi of 32Pi (40 mCi/ml, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) was added, and slices were labeled for 90 min. Slices were treated for 30 min with 4-β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB, 10−7M; Sigma), 4-α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (PDD, 10−6M; Sigma), or a combination of PDB (10−7M) with 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7, 10−4M; Sigma), polymyxin B (PMXB, 10,000 IU/ml; Sigma), chelerythrine (10−5M; Sigma), calphostin C (5 × 10−6M; gift from H. Boddeke, Sandoz AG, Basel, Switzerland) or staurosporine (10−5M; Sigma). The PKC antagonists were added 15 min prior to PDB. Phorbol esters, chelerythrine, calphostin C, and staurosporine were dissolved in Me2SO (0.01%), H-7, and PMXB in phosphate-free ACSF. Me2SO did not affect B-50 or neurogranin phosphorylation. After treatment the slices were washed twice in 2 ml of ice-cold ACSF buffer containing 100 mM NaF, 1.2 mM NaHPO4, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, and homogenized in 100 μl of H2O containing 100 mM NaF, 10 mM EDTA, and 5 mM EGTA. Of the total homogenate 75 μl was added to 50 μl stop-mix solution containing (final concentration) 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.001% bromphenol blue, and samples were stored at −20°C until trichloroacetic acid precipitation and immunoprecipitation. The remainder of the homogenate was used to determine protein content (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213164) Google Scholar) with bovin serum albumin as a standard. To determine quantitative conditions for neurogranin immunoprecipitation slices were 32Pi labeled, washed, and homogenized. A linear relationship between the amount of hippocampal tissue added to the precipitation mixture and the amount of immunoprecipitated neurogranin was found in the range of 0.15-2.5 μg of hippocampal tissue (data not shown). Therefore all immunoprecipitations to determine neurogranin phosphorylation were performed with 0.625 μg slice homogenate protein. Purified neurogranin was phosphorylated with PKC as described earlier (33Hens J.J.H. Benfenati F. Nielander H.B. Valtorta F. Gispen W.H. De Graan P.N.E. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1530-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).For electrophysiological recordings three slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused (1 ml/min) for at least 60 min with gassed phosphate-free ACSF at 30°C. Bipolar stimulation electrodes, stainless steel wires of 50 μm diameter (insulated except for the tip), were placed on the radial layer of the CA1 field. Glass microelectrodes with a tip diameter of 3-5 μm, resistance 2-5 MΩ, filled with phosphate-free ACSF were used to record field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the radial layer of CA1 field in response to orthodromic stimulation. In all three slices the maximal fEPSP was determined first. Only slices in which the maximal fEPSP was bigger than 1 mV were selected. Two slices were randomly chosen to be used for electrophysiological recordings. Stimulation intensity was adjusted to evoke half-maximal responses and was kept constant throughout the experiment. Thirty min after placement of the electrodes the superfusion medium was changed to ACSF containing 100 μCi/ml 32Pi, and after 90 min, base-line recordings of fEPSPs were started (0.05 Hz, 25 min). Subsequently, one slice received a short train of high frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s, test intensity), and recordings were continued for another 10, 30, 60, 90, or 120 min. The other stimulated slice did not receive high frequency stimulation and the third slice served as an unstimulated control. In some experiments slices were treated with 50 μMD-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV; Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Norwich, UK) 10 min before high frequency stimulation was applied. At the end of the experiments, all three slices were removed from the recording chamber, washed, and homogenized. Evoked fEPSPs were recorded using a conventional AC-coupled amplifier, stored on magnetic tape, and digitized using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments) software. Data were analyzed using the same software, and the initial slope of the fEPSPs was calculated. For graphical presentation, the data are expressed as percentages of the average of the base-line slope of the fEPSPs.The degree of B-50 phosphorylation was determined using the method described by De Graan et al.(34De Graan P.N.E. Dekker L.V. Oestreicher A.B. Van der Voorn L. Gispen W.H. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the degree of neurogranin phosphorylation was determined with a slightly modified procedure (see below). For B-50 immunoprecipitation, 10 μg of protein homogenate was incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:200 (final dilution) antibody 8919 or 8420 in 400 μl of radioimmunoassay buffer of the following composition: 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v). For neurogranin immunoprecipitation 0.625 μg of protein homogenate was incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:66.7 (final dilution) antibody 8420 in 400 μl of radioimmunoassay buffer. Antigen complexes were precipitated with washed pansorbin (Calbiochem), solubilized in stop-mix solution, and boiled for 10 min. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 11% (B-50) or 18% (neurogranin) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in duplicate or triplicate. Incorporation of 32P into proteins was detected using a Fuji BAS1000 imaging system (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and quantified using PDI Quantity One software.Total 32P incorporation into proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In short, 2.5 μg of protein homogenate was spotted on 3MM Whatmann paper, the filters were washed three times with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution and thereafter with ethanol, ethanol/acetone (1:1), and acetone alone. Filters were dried and counted in a Packard 2000 CA liquid scintillation counter. The analyzed amounts of 32P incorporation into B-50 and neurogranin were normalized for total 32P incorporation into proteins as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and are expressed as percentages of the unstimulated controls. Statistical analysis were performed using Student's t test for unpaired or paired samples as appropriate.RESULTSTo assess whether neurogranin is a substrate for PKC in the hippocampal slice, we quantified B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation in slices treated with either phorbol ester, PKC inhibitors, or both. After treatment of slices for 30 min with 10−7M PDB neurogranin as well as B-50 phosphorylation was significantly increased compared with buffer controls (Fig. 1): 134 ± 44% (mean ± S.E.) and 182 ± 36%, respectively. The PDB-induced increase in neurogranin and B-50 phosphorylation could be antagonized by the kinase inhibitors H-7 (10−6M), PMXB (10,000 IU/ml), calphostin C (5 × 10−6M), chelerythrine (10−5M), or staurosporine (10−5M). Neither antagonists had an effect on basal neurogranin or B-50 phosphorylation (data not shown). The phorbol ester PDD (10−6M), inactive with respect to PKC activation, affected neither B-50 nor neurogranin phosphorylation. These results show that it is possible to quantify changes in the in situ phosphorylation state of neurogranin and B-50 in a single hippocampal slice and that neurogranin is an in situ PKC substrate.Application of a short train of high frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s, test intensity) induced an increase in the slope of the fEPSPs in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (Fig. 2). Ten min after the tetanus was applied the increase was 71.3 ± 17.3%; at 30 min, 56.2 ± 12.8%; at 60 min, 60.8 ± 14.1%; at 90 min, 59.7 ± 7%; and at 120 min, 53 ± 6.2%. Typical examples of evoked responses are shown in Fig. 2F. Slices not receiving high frequency stimulation showed stable responses throughout the experiments (fig. 2, A-E, open circles).Figure 2:Induction of LTP by high frequency stimulation. A-E, to examine the development of LTP after application of the conditioning train electrophysiological recordings were stopped 10 (A), 30 (B), 60 (C), 90 (D), or 120 (E) min after induction of LTP. Presented are means ± S.E. from 5 (E), 6 (A, B, and D), or 13 (C) experiments. Filled circles represent slices receiving high frequency stimulation at t = 0 min, and open circles represent slices only receiving low frequency stimulation. F, typical examples of evoked responses in the dendritic region of area CA1 of the hippocampus. The upper plot is a response 5 min before induction of LTP, and the middle plot is a response 55 min after induction of LTP. Both responses are plotted together in the lower panel. Calibration: 2 mV and 10 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A typical example of phosphorimage analysis of immunoprecipitates from hippocampal slices 60 min after tetanic stimulation is shown in Fig. 3. B-50 immunoprecipitation reveals a single phospho band at 48 kDa on 11% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylated neurogranin is not seen under these conditions, because it runs of the gel in the dye front. Neurogranin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B) reveals a single band at 17 kDa on 18% SDS-PAGE. Under these conditions B-50 phosphorylation is not detectable, because it is much less prominent than neurogranin phosphorylation. The 17-kDa phospho-band was identified as neurogranin by three independent techniques. 1) The 17-kDa band comigrated with PKC phosphorylated purified neurogranin on 18% SDS-PAGE. 2) Unlabeled hippocampal tissue displaced PKC-phosphorylated purified neurogranin in the immunoprecipitation in a concentration-dependent manner. 3) No 17-kDa phosphoprotein was detectable when the immunoprecipitation was performed after preabsorption of the antibodies with purified neurogranin (data not shown). Quantification of these phosphorimages revealed that neurogranin phosphorylation (Fig. 3B) in the LTP slice was 168%, in the slice receiving only low frequency stimulation 98.7% compared with the unstimulated control slice (100%). For B-50 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), these data were 166.3 and 94.3%, respectively. Total 32P incorporation as determined with trichloroacetic acid precipitation was not different between the three slices in this experiment.Figure 3:Increase in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation 60 min after induction of LTP. A, typical example of phosphorimage analysis of B-50 immunoprecipitation after 11% SDS-PAGE, showing the amount of 32P incorporation into B-50 in an unstimulated control slice (CON), a slice in which LTP is induced with high frequency stimulation (LTP), and a slice only receiving low frequency stimulation (LFS).

Arrows indicate the position of phosphorylated B-50 and neurogranin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One hour after LTP induction neurogranin phosphorylation was increased by 77.9 ± 17.5% in slices showing LTP (n = 6, p < 0.01) and B-50 phosphorylation was increased by 31 ± 6.5% (n = 13, p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, A and C). To test if this increase was specific for LTP expression, induction of LTP was prevented by application of 50 μMD-APV (electrophysiological data not shown). Slices in which LTP was blocked with D-APV did not show an increase in neurogranin or B-50 phosphorylation 60 min after high frequency stimulation (Fig. 4, A and C). D-APV itself had no effect on B-50 or neurogranin phosphorylation in low frequency stimulated slices. In four slices, the tetanic stimulation induced only a short (less than 5 min) increase in the evoked responses (data not shown). In these four slices, recordings were continued for 60 min and than B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation were determined. In these slices where high frequency stimulation failed to produce LTP, there was also no change in B-50 or neurogranin phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and C).Figure 4:Increase in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation only occurs if LTP is induced. A and C, hippocampal slices received only low frequency test stimulation (open bars) or test stimulation and high frequency stimulation (filled bars). Sixty minutes after the tetanus slices were analyzed for B-50 (A) and neurogranin (C) phosphorylation. Slices expressing LTP (LTP) showed increased B-50 (31 ± 6.5%, p < 0.001, n = 13) and neurogranin (77.9 ± 17.5%, p < 0.01, n = 6) phosphorylation. After blockade of LTP by 50 μMD-APV (APV), there was no difference in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation between high frequency stimulated slices and slices only receiving low frequency stimulation (p > 0.1, n = 6 for both B-50 and neurogranin). In those slices in which high frequency stimulation failed to induce LTP (No LTP) no difference in B-50 or neurogranin phosphorylation was found between the two groups of slices. B and D, the increase in B-50 (B) and neurogranin (D) phosphorylation found 60 min after high frequency stimulation was plotted against the increase in the slope of the fEPSP of the same slice. The plot for B-50 as well as for neurogranin revealed a significant correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.80, p < 0.001, n = 13 for B-50 and correlation coefficient = 0.97, p < 0.001, n = 6 for neurogranin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subsequently, we determined whether there is a correlation between the increase in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation and the increase in the slope of the EPSPs. Sixty min after LTP induction (Fig. 4, B and D), the increase in B-50 as well as in neurogranin phosphorylation was significantly correlated with the increase in the slope of the EPSP (correlation coefficient = 0.80, p < 0.001, n = 13 for B-50 and correlation coefficient = 0.97, p < 0.001, n = 6 for neurogranin).To study the temporal relationship between the increase in phosphorylation of both pre- and postsynaptic PKC substrates, experiments were stopped at different times after high frequency stimulation (Fig. 5). Neurogranin phosphorylation shows a significant increase in phosphorylation only 60 min after LTP was induced (77.9 ± 17.5%, n = 6). At no other time points significant differences could be detected between neurogranin phosphorylation in slices expressing LTP and slices receiving low frequency stimulation, although there was a robust potentiation at these time points (see Fig. 2, A-E). B-50 phosphorylation in potentiated slices is already increased 10 min after induction of LTP (62.6 ± 19.9%, n = 5) and remained elevated at 30 (66 ± 13.0%, n = 6) and 60 min (31 ± 6.5%, n = 13) after LTP induction, compared with slices receiving only low frequency stimulation. At all time points with a significant increase in B-50 phosphorylation (i.e. 10, 30, and 60 min after application of high frequency stimulation) this increase is significantly correlated with the increase in the evoked EPSP (correlation coefficient = 0.94, p < 0.01, n = 6 10 min after LTP; correlation coefficient = 0.81, p < 0.01, n = 6 30 min after LTP and correlation coefficient = 0.80, p < 0.001, n = 13 60 min after LTP). At 90 and 120 min after high frequency stimulation, no difference could be detected between B-50 phosphorylation in potentiated and low frequency stimulated slices (correlation coefficient = 0.19 and 0.21, not significant for 90 and 120 min after LTP, respectively), despite the robust potentiation of the fEPSP induced in these slices (see Fig. 2, D and E).Figure 5:Increases in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation show temporal differences during LTP. A, slices expressing LTP (filled circles) show a significant increase in the amount of phosphorylated B-50 compared with the matched low frequency stimulated slices at 10 (p < 0.01), 30 (p < 0.01), and 60 min (p < 0.001) after application of high frequency stimulation. Ninety and 120 min after LTP induction there is no difference between the two groups of slices (p > 0.1). Slices only receiving low frequency stimulation for all the time points studied show no change in B-50 phosphorylation (open circles). B, neurogranin phosphorylation is only increased 60 min after application of high frequency stimulation in slices expressing LTP (filled circles) compared with slices showing no potentiation (p < 0.01). At the other time points there is no difference between the two groups of slices (p > 0.1). Slices only receiving low frequency stimulation for all the time points studied show no change in neurogranin phosphorylation (open circles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONOur data demonstrate that in hippocampus slices neurogranin is an endogenous PKC substrate. Its phosphorylation is increased by the phorbol ester PDB, and this increase can be antagonized by kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, we show that 60 min after LTP induction in the CA1 field of the hippocampus the in situ phosphorylation state of presynaptic protein B-50 as well as postsynaptic protein neurogranin is significantly increased in potentiated as compared with unpotentiated slices. This increase in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation is dependent on LTP expression, because inhibition of LTP induction by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV also prevents the increase in phosphorylation of both proteins. The fact that slices in which tetanic stimulation failed to induce LTP do not exhibit increased phosphorylation shows that the increase in phosphorylation is related to the expression of LTP, rather than to the delivery of the high frequency stimulation. Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in B-50 and neurogranin phosphorylation measured in a single slice is highly correlated with the increase in the slope of the EPSPs measured in that slice.Our experimental approach, using in situ phosphorylation in hippocampal slices combined with quantitative immunoprecipitation of B-50 and neurogranin, allows to distinguish between pre- and postsynaptic PKC activity and resolve temporal differences in their activation. Presynaptic B-50 phosphorylation is increased from 10 to 60 min, but no longer at 90 and 120 min after tetanic stimulation. These results are in line with data from previous experiments (19Gianotti C. Nunzi M.G. Gispen W.H. Corradetti R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 843-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) obtained after static labeling of slices in an interface chamber, a setup limiting measurements to 60 min post-tetanus. Recently, an increase in B-50 phosphorylation (+26 ± 9%) at the PKC phosphorylation site 10 min post-tetanus was found (16Leahy J.C. Luo Y. Kent C.S. Meiri K.F. Vallano M.C. Neuroscience. 1993; 52: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This increase was measured by Western blotting, using monoclonal B-50 antibodies directed against the single PKC phosphorylation site (Ser-41). Since the increase in B-50 phosphorylation is strictly dependent upon NMDA receptor activation, a retrograde signal appears to be involved, the nature of which is at present unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2062048900,"The TATA binding protein (TBP) is a central component of all eukaryotic transcription machineries. The recruitment of TBP to the promoter is slow and possibly rate limiting in transcription complex assembly. In an effort to understand the nature of this potential rate-limiting step, we have investigated the physical state of TBP prior to DNA binding. By chemical cross-linking, gel filtration chromatography, and protein affinity chromatography, we find that the conserved carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of human TBP dimerizes when not bound to DNA. The data completely support the proposed dimeric structure of plant TBP, previously determined by x-ray crystallography. TBP dimers are quite stable, having an approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) in the low nanomolar range. The dimerization interface appears to be dominated by hydrophobic forces, as predicted by the crystal structure. TBP dimers do not bind DNA, but they must dissociate into monomers before stably binding to the TATA box. Dissociation of TBP dimers appears to be relatively slow, and as such has the potential to dictate the kinetics of DNA binding. The TATA binding protein (TBP) is a central component of all eukaryotic transcription machineries. The recruitment of TBP to the promoter is slow and possibly rate limiting in transcription complex assembly. In an effort to understand the nature of this potential rate-limiting step, we have investigated the physical state of TBP prior to DNA binding. By chemical cross-linking, gel filtration chromatography, and protein affinity chromatography, we find that the conserved carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of human TBP dimerizes when not bound to DNA. The data completely support the proposed dimeric structure of plant TBP, previously determined by x-ray crystallography. TBP dimers are quite stable, having an approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) in the low nanomolar range.

In the pathogenic trypanosomatids, this reaction is the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the antioxidant metabolite, trypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), and is a target for drug design. In this study, GSP synthetase was purified to near homogeneity from E. coli B, the gene encoding it was isolated and sequenced, the enzyme was overexpressed and purified in quantity, and the recombinant enzyme was characterized. The 70-kDa protein was found to have an unexpected second catalytic activity, glutathionylspermidine amide bond hydrolysis. Thus, the bifunctional GSP synthetase/amidase catalyzes opposing amide bond-forming and -cleaving reactions, with net hydrolysis of ATP. The synthetase activity is selectively abrogated by proteolytic cleavage 81 residues from the C terminus, suggesting that the two activities reside in distinct domains (N-terminal amidase and C-terminal synthetase). Proteolysis at this site is facile in the absence of substrates, but is inhibited in the presence of ATP, glutathione, and Mg2+.A series of analogs was used to probe the spermidine-binding site of the synthetase activity. The activity of diaminopropane as a substrate, inactivity of the C4-C8 diaminoalkanes, and greater los s of specificity for analogs modified in the 3-aminopropyl moiety than for those modified in the 4-aminobutyl moiety indicate that the enzyme recognizes predominantly the diaminopropane portion of spermidine and corroborate N-1 (the aminopropyl N) as the site of glutathione linkage (Tabor, H. and Tabor, C.

INTRODUCTIONFrom a chemotherapeutic point of view, the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria is an attractive target, since mutants producing incomplete lipopolysaccharide are more susceptible to antibiotics and less pathogenic. Since 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO1( 1The abbreviations used are: KDO 8-P3-deoxyoctulosonate 8-phosphateA 5-PD-arabinose 5-phosphateDAH 7-P3-deoxyheptulosonate 7-phosphatePEPphosphoenolpyruvatePiinorganic phosphateUDP-GlcNAcuridine-5′-diphospho-N-acetyl-2-amino-2-deoxyglucosePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reaction.) ; 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid) is a site-specific molecule found only in Gram-negative organisms and is required for lipid A maturation and cellular growth, the inhibition of its production would be an excellent chemotherapeutic goal (1Ray P.H. Kelsey J.E. Bigham E.C. Benedict C.D. Miller T.A. Anderson L. Unger F.M. ACS Symposium Series 231. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1983: 141-169Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the enzyme(s) responsible for the biosynthesis of KDO, then, would represent a novel class of antibiotics since no existing drugs work by disrupting synthesis of lipopolysaccharide.Biosynthesis and utilization of KDO can be envisioned as an essential minor branched pathway in carbohydrate metabolism in Gram-negative bacteria. A vital enzyme in this pathway is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid 8-phosphate (KDO 8-P) synthase (EC 4.1.2.16). This enzyme catalyzes the condensation of D-arabinose 5-phosphate (A 5-P) with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to yield inorganic phosphate (Pi) and KDO 8-P. KDO 8-P is dephosphorylated by the next enzyme in the pathway to give KDO which is subsequently activated to cytidine 5′-monophosphate-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate and transferred to a lipopolysaccharide precursor (1Ray P.H. Kelsey J.E. Bigham E.C. Benedict C.D. Miller T.A. Anderson L. Unger F.M. ACS Symposium Series 231. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1983: 141-169Google Scholar). KDO 8-P synthase is a member of a family of enzymes including 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH 7-P) synthase (EC 4.1.2.15) and N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.3.20) which catalyzes the condensation of PEP with a phosphorylated sugar to produce a new phosphorylated 3-deoxy-α-keto sugar acid three carbons longer. Understanding the mechanism by which these enzymes catalyze this aldol condensation would be of great importance in the design of selective inhibitors for each of these biologically important 3-deoxycarbohydrates.Recently, both Kohen et al.(2Kohen A. Berkovich R. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1577-1582Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and our group (3Dotson G.D. Nanjappan P. Reily M.D. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12392-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have reported the steric course of the enzymatic condensation catalyzed by KDO 8-P synthase. Like the vast majority of known PEP-utilizing enzymes, the catalysis occurs with addition of the electrophile to the si face of PEP. This consistence in facial specificity may be indicative of a conserved PEP binding motif. Most importantly, these results ruled out any mechanism involving the formation of a freely rotating sp3 center at C-3 of PEP during catalysis.Knowledge of the fate of the PEP enolic oxygen atom is also critical in evaluating the enzymatic mechanism of KDO 8-P synthase. Cleavage at either the C-O or P-O of the PEP enolic bond can account for the liberation of the inorganic phosphate co-produced during KDO 8-P synthase catalysis. PEP labeled with 18O in the enolic oxygen has classically been used to distinguish between these two types of bond cleavage. Studies previously published by Hedstrom and Abeles (4Hedstrom L. Abeles R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) on the fate of the PEP enolic oxygen during KDO 8-P synthase catalysis, using such an 18O-labeled PEP, were accomplished utilizing only partially purified enzyme extracts containing just 10% KDO 8-P synthase. In addition, certain quantitative aspects of the investigation, such as the amount of A 5-P used as substrate and the amount of KDO 8-P formed relative to the Pi generated, were not reported.In this paper, we wish to report the design of an overexpression system as well as a single-step method for the purification of KDO 8-P synthase. The cloned enzyme has been utilized in 13C and 31P NMR studies to establish the fate of the enolic oxygen of PEP during KDO 8-P synthase catalysis and to identify the origin of the anomeric oxygen of enzymatically derived KDO 8-P.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe chemicals used were of reagent grade or of the highest purity commercially available and were not further purified. Q-Sepharose, ammonium sulfate, D-arabinose 5-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate (unlabeled), 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid, dithiothreitol, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. Sodium [2-13C]pyruvate (99%13C) and 2H218O (un-normalized; 98%18O, 90%2H) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. The Escherichia coli strains BL 21 and BL (DE 3) were obtained from Novagen. The thermal cycling was performed using an MJR Research Thermal cycler. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Michigan, Biomedical Research Resources Core Facility, and at Warner-Lambert Parke-Davis. DNA sequencing, NH2-terminal protein sequencing, and total amino acid content as well as electrospray mass spectral analysis were performed by the University of Michigan, Biomedical Research Resources Core Facility. The Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp kit was used for the PCR reaction except recombinant pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene Cloning Systems, Buffer 1) was substituted for the Taq DNA polymerase. Promega DNA and PCR purification kits were utilized. Mass spectral analyses of small molecular weight compounds were performed at The Michigan State University Biochemistry Instrument Facility. The Kohara λ phage was provided by Dr. Rowena G. Matthews of the Department of Biological Chemistry at the University of Michigan.PCR Cloning of kdsATwo primers were constructed to correspond to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the open reading frame identified as the kdsA gene. The 5′ sequence was GATTCTAGAATTCATATGAAACAAAAAGTGGTT. The 3′ sequence was AAAGATCTTACTTGCTGGTATCCA. The forward primer incorporated an NdeI (underlined) and the reverse primer a BglII (underlined) site for cloning into the expression vector, pT7-7 (5Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, 1990Google Scholar) . The kdsA gene was amplified (30 cycles) from Kohara λ phage 4D10 by PCR (6Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) . The annealing temperature was 45°C. The PCR-amplified DNA was sequentially digested with NdeI and BglII and directionally cloned into NdeI/BamHI-restricted pT7-7. Recombinants from TG1 cells were obtained and screened by restriction analysis. Appropriate plasmid DNA (pT7-7/kdsA) was used to transform competent BL 21 (DE 3) cells. The correct sequence (7Woisetschlager M. Hogenauer G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 207: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) of the cloned kdsA gene was confirmed by automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer utilizing dye-labeled dideoxy nucleotides, Taq polymerase and double-stranded DNA, purified by the Promega PCR purification kit. Both strands of the plasmid DNA were sequenced.Preparation and Purification of Recombinant KDO 8-P SynthaseCell CultureE. coli BL 21 (DE 3) harboring the plasmid pT7-7/kdsA, was grown to an A600 = 0.6 in 5 ml of 2xTY media. The preparative media (2xTY, 50 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated with 1000 μl of the above culture per 200 ml of media. The cultures were incubated at 37°C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm) in 1-liter baffled flasks (200 ml/flask) to an A600 = 0.6-0.8 and 400 μl of 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β[D-galactopyranoside was added. The incubation (37°C, 300 rpm) was continued for 4 h.Preparation of Crude ExtractCells from the above culture were harvested by centrifugation (4,500 × g, 15 min) and the total wet weight of the cells was measured (3.4 g/liter of 2xTY). The cell pellet was suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer (1 g/5 m). This step and all subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C and all buffers contained 0.2 mM dithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted by 2 min of sonication, with cooling (4 × 30 s pulses with a 30 s delay between pulses) and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer as described above and the whole process repeated. The supernatants were combined for the next step.Anion Exchange ChromatographyThe pH of the cell-free extract was adjusted to 7.4 with 1 M Tris base and filtered through a 0.22-μm sterile filter. The cell-free extract was divided into three portions. Each portion of the cell-free extract was applied to an anion exchange column (1.5 × 70-cm column packed with Q-Sepharose) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 75 mM KCl. The column was first washed with 200 ml of equilibration buffer and then eluted with 1 liter of a linear gradient of 100-400 mM KCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer. The flow rate was kept at 1 ml/min. Fractions (13.5 ml) containing KDO 8-P synthase, determined by the periodate-TBA assay (8Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SDS-PAGE, were pooled and subjected to concentration via lyophilization. The concentrated enzyme solutions from three individual runs were combined and dialyzed overnight against 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) buffer (3 × 1000 ml).Assay ProceduresKDO 8-P Synthase AssayAssay mixtures contained 0.1 M Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 3 mM PEP, 3 mM A 5-P, and enzyme, in a final volume of 150 μl. After incubation for 10 min at 37°C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 150 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged to remove the protein. An aliquot of the incubation mixture was used to determine either the amount of KDO 8-P produced using the periodate-TBA assay reported for KDO 8-P synthase by Ray (8Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the amount of Pi produced using the method of Lanzetta et al.(9Lanzetta P. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Both methods give similar results. One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of KDO 8-P of Pi released per min at 37°C.Protein AssayThe protein concentrations of enzyme fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Based on numerous total amino acid composition analyses, the Bio-Rad protein assay overestimates KDO 8-P synthase by a factor of 1.3.Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisElectrophoretic analyses were performed utilizing 12% denaturing gels in the discontinuous Laemmli buffer system with a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II. Gels were stained using 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Amino Acid Composition and Amino-terminal Sequence AnalysisThe total amino acid content of the recombinant KDO 8-P synthase was determined by the University of Michigan, Biomedical Research Resources Core Facility utilizing an Applied Biosystems 420 analyzer equipped with a model 130 HPLC unit. The first 10 amino-terminal amino acids were sequenced by the University of Michigan, Biomedical Research Resources Core Facility via an Applied Biosystems 473 analyzer.Molecular Weight DeterminationThe molecular weight of recombinant KDO 8-P synthase was determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy performed by the University of Michigan, Biomedical Research Resources Core Facility, utilizing a Vestec electrospray mass spectrometer.Mass Spectrometry of Small Mr CompoundsA gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer in the electron ionization mode was used at the Michigan State University Biochemistry Instrument Facility for the analysis of trimethyl phosphate.Synthesis of [2-13C]PhosphoenolpyruvateTo a suspension of sodium [2-13C]pyruvate (1.0 g, 9 mmol) in CCl4 (25 ml), was added 1.1 eq of concentrated HCl and 1.0 eq of bromine (10Stubbe J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction was stirred at 25°C until the reaction mixture was colorless. The reaction was then filtered to remove NaCl and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The [2-13C]3-bromopyruvic acid was taken up into anhydrous diethyl ether and converted into dimethyl [2-13C]phosphoenolpyruvate by treatment with trimethyl phosphite under Perkow reaction conditions (11Stubbe J.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The title compound was achieved as the monocyclohexylamine salt (m.p. 143-144°C; lit. (11Stubbe J.A.

The [2-13C,18O]3-bromopyruvic acid was then converted into the title compound as described above (m.p. 143-144°C; lit. 143-146°C) (12Clark V.M. Kirby A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 3705Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The PEP obtained from the 3-bromo-[2-13C,18O]pyruvic acid reaction contained 70%18O label in the enolic oxygen. This was determined by integration of the C-2 resonance due to [2-13C,18O]PEP and the 18O-shifted carbon resonance due to [2-13C,18O]PEP, in the subspectra created by multiple-quantum filtration of the 13C NMR spectra (14Wooten E.W.

This reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 h in a shaking water bath. The reaction mixture, unquenched, was loaded directly onto a 1.5 × 27-cm anion exchange column (Bio-Rad AG-MP1, Cl− form), washed with 100 ml of H2O, and eluted with 500 ml of a linear gradient of 0-400 mM NaCl. Two periodate-TBA positive peaks were obtained, the first at 85 mM, KDO (5%), and the second at 160 mM, KDO 8-P (95%). The fractions containing the KDO 8-P were pooled, freeze-dried, reconstituted in 2 ml of H2O, and desalted on a 2 × 60-cm Bio-Gel P-2 column. The periodate-TBA positive/AgCl negative fractions were pooled and freeze-dried to give the desired [2-13C]KDO 8-P.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Methods31P NMRProton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer (11.75 T) at a probe temperature of 298 K, tuned to 202.4 MHz, using 5-mm high resolution NMR tubes. Spectra were obtained with a spectral width of 2000 Hz, 1.0 s relaxation delay, and 32,768 complex points in the time domain using simultaneous detection of real and imaginary components. The GARP sequence was used for heteronuclear decoupling. The time domain data were apodized with an exponential (0.5 Hz for X-nuclei) prior to zero-filling followed by Fourier transformation. Chemical shifts were reported relative to an external sample of 10 mM inorganic phosphate (0.0 ppm) in 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM EGTA and 10%2H2O.13C NMRProton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX500 spectrometer (11.75 T) at a probe temperature of 298 K, tuned to 125.7 MHz, using 5-mm high resolution NMR tubes.

Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane. Dioxane in sample buffer is used as an external reference (67.3 ppm).KDO 8-P Synthase Reaction in [16O]H2OThe reaction mixtures contained the following in 0.5 ml of 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5): 10 mM A 5-P, 10 mM [2-13C,18O]PEP (99%13C, 70%18O), 10 mM EGTA, 10%2H2O for field frequency lock, and 0.2 units of KDO 8-P synthase. All components of the reaction mixture except KDO 8-P synthase were equilibrated at 25°C. After taking a control spectrum the reaction was initiated by the addition of KDO 8-P synthase. Data accumulation began 2-4 min after addition of the enzyme.KDO 8-P Synthase Reaction in 2H218 O[2-13C]PEP (5 μmol), A 5-P (5 μmol), and EGTA (5 μmol) were dissolved in 200 mM Tris-HCl (500 μl) (pH 7.5) and lyophilized to dryness. 2H218O (350 μl) and H2O (120 μl) were added to the dry powder, and the solution transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube. All components of the reaction mixture except KDO 8-P synthase were equilibrated at 25°C. After taking a control 13C NMR spectrum the reaction was initiated by the addition of KDO 8-P synthase (0.2 units; 30 μl). Data accumulation began 2-4 min after addition of the enzyme.Purification of Pi from Enzymatic ReactionGel Filtration ChromatographyThe reaction mixtures which utilized [2-13C,18O]PEP as a substrate were combined at the conclusion of the NMR experiments and loaded onto a 2 × 66-cm Bio-Gel P-2 column equilibrated with H2O at 25°C. The column was eluted with H2O and the fractions (8 ml) assayed for Pi, A 5-P, and KDO 8-P. The fractions containing Pi were well resolved from KDO 8-P but did contain some A 5-P. Fractions containing Pi without A 5-P were pooled and lyophilized. Additional Pi fractions containing A 5-P were combined and lyophilized separately. The total amount of Pi obtained was equivalent to the amount of KDO 8-P formed.Precipitation of Pi as MgNH4PO4The lyophilized Pi fractions containing A 5-P were dissolved in 3 ml of H2O and 0.5 ml of magnesia mixture (2.7 mmol of MgCl2, 18.7 mmol of NH4Cl, 15 mmol of NH4OH in 10 ml of H2O) added. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to pH 9 with 2.5 M NH4OH and allowed to stand at 4°C for 12 h. The MgNH4PO4 precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 3 ml of cold 3.7 M NH4OH. The base-washed precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and dried in vacuo.Cation Exchange ChromatographyThe MgNH4PO4 precipitate was then combined with the lyophilized pure Pi fractions (from the gel filtration column) and dissolved in 1 ml of H2O containing a small amount of Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 resin (H+ form) to aid in solubilization. The resin suspension was transferred to a 1 × 10-cm Bio-Rad AG 50W-X8 resin (H+ form) column and eluted with H2O. The Pi positive fractions were combined, the pH adjusted to 4.1 with 0.1 N KOH, and lyophilized to yield potassium phosphate (≈6 μmol).Conversion of Biosynthetic Pi to Its Trimethyl EsterTo the lyophilization vessel containing Pi was added 100 μl of 95% ethanol and a drop of concentrated HCl. Methylation was accomplished by the dropwise addition of a fresh solution of diazomethane in ether to the lyophilization vessel. The solvent was then removed by a stream of dry nitrogen.RESULTSOverproduction and Purification of E. coli kdsAThe T7 polymerase-dependent expression system pT7-7 was used to overexpress KDO 8-P synthase in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3).The large scale (1 liter to 3 g of E. coli) expression of KDO 8-P synthase produced 180-220 mg of homogeneous cloned enzyme after one anion-exchange chromatographic step (center of peak). This represented 40% of the total activity of KDO 8-P synthase present in the crude extract. The protein purity was judged to be >98% by both SDS-PAGE (data not shown) and size exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography utilizing a Synchropak GPC100 (data not shown) and had a specific activity of 9 units/mg. Several hundred milligrams of KDO 8-P synthase (96% pure, another 35% of the activity present in the crude extract) may be obtained by combining the fractions from both the leading and trailing portions of the above peak. SDS-PAGE as well as specific activity measurements indicates that even the crude extract could be used directly for most experiments, however, only the >98% fraction was used in this work. The electrospray mass spectrum of KDO 8-P synthase, monomeric molecular mass of 30,842 ± 17 daltons, and the experimentally determined NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, MKQKVVSIGD, are both consistent with the molecular mass and amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence of kdsA, respectively. The total amino acid content was also consistent with theoretical values.Oxygen Transfer during KDO 8-P Synthase CatalysisThe fate of the PEP enolic oxygen during enzymatic catalysis and the origin of the anomeric oxygen of KDO 8-P were investigated by one-dimensional isotopic-shifted 13C and 31P NMR.Fate of the PEP Enolic OxygenFig. 1 depicts the proton-decoupled 31P NMR spectra of a KDO 8-P synthase reaction mixture using doubly labeled [2-13C,18O]PEP (70%18O and 99%13C) as a substrate. Spectrum ashows the reaction mixture before the addition of enzyme. The phosphorus resonance of the α and β anomers of A 5-P (60:40) can be seen as two singlets centered at 1.3 ppm. The PEP phosphorus resonance centered at −3.1 ppm is a multiplet consisting of two pairs of 13C coupled doublets arising from either 16O or 18O in the enolic position, and further isotopic shifting of each of these signals due to vinylic deuterium incorporation during the 18O labeling process. Seventy percent of the PEP is 18O labeled in the enolic position as determined by integration of the multiple-quantum filtered 13C NMR spectra (14Wooten E.W. Dua R.K. Dotson G.D. Woodard R.W. J. Mag. Res. Ser. A. 1994; 107: 50-55Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Some nonspecific substrate degradation from both PEP and A 5-P resulting in Pi contamination can be seen at 0 ppm consisting of two singlets of approximately equal intensities of which the downfield singlet represents [16O4]Pi and the upfield singlet represents [16O3,18O]Pi. Spectra b, c, and d depict the enzymatic reaction at various time intervals after the addition of KDO 8-P synthase. The insert above spectrum dis an expansion of the Pi region from the difference spectrum generated by substrating spectrum dfrom a (d-a). The α-pyranose anomer of KDO 8-P can be seen growing in at 1.91 ppm with a subsequent increase in Pi and a decrease in substrate intensities. The α-pyranose anomer of KDO 8-P was chosen for monitoring because it is the most abundant and appears first. The β-pyranose as well as the α- and β-furanose anomers give identical results (two of the three resonances can be seen on either side of the major α-pyranose resonance). A closer examination of the 31P resonances due to Pi reveal that it is composed of a majority of 18O labeled Pi as would be expected in the case of C-O bond cleavage of the PEP enolic bond. The ratio of [16O4]Pi/[16O3,18O]Pi in the difference spectra, spectra d-a(shown as an expanded insert above spectrum din Fig. 1), is 32/68 as determined by the integration of the respective phosphorus resonances.From a reaction identical to that in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 shows the regions of the proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra corresponding to the C-2 resonance of [2-13C,18O]PEP (149.95 ppm) and again only that of the C-2 resonance of the α-pyranose anomer of KDO 8-P (96.85 ppm) although the other isomers are present. Spectrum ashows the reaction mixture before the addition of enzyme. The complexity of the 13C C-2 PEP resonance is due to the 31P scalar coupling and the isotopic shielding effects from the presence of 2H and 18O (14Wooten E.W. Dua R.K. Dotson G.D. Woodard R.W. J. Mag. Res. Ser. A. 1994; 107: 50-55Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Spectra b-ddepict the enzymatic reaction at various time intervals after the addition of KDO 8-P synthase. The minor peak seen slightly upfield of the major resonance at 96.85 ppm is due to the C-3 deuterium isotopic shielding effect upon the anomeric carbon of KDO 8-P and corresponds to the amount of deuterium seen in the PEP substrate.Figure 2:13C NMR spectra of the KDO 8-P synthase incubation mixture using [2-13C,18O]PEP as a substrate. a, proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectrum of A 5-P (10 mM) and [2-13C,18O]PEP (99%13C, 70%18O; 10 mM) in 200 mM Tris-HCl in 10%2H2O containing EGTA (10 mM) at pH 7.5. b-d, proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra obtained after the addition of KDO 8-P synthase (0.2 units) to the incubation mixture in a. Spectrum b was obtained 15 min after the addition of KDO 8-P synthase (226 scans); spectrum c was obtained after 25 min (463 scans); and spectrum d was obtained after 41 min (810 scans). The new resonance at 96.85 ppm corresponds to C-2 of the newly formed KDO 8-P (α-pyranose). The minor peak resonating slightly upfield of this resonance is due to the C-3 deuterium isotopic shielding effect upon the anomeric carbon of KDO 8-P.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitative mass spectral analysis of the trimethyl phosphate derivative of the enzymatically obtained Pi from the above reactions contained 67.4%18O label and gave a fragmentation pattern corresponding to that which was described by Banerjee et al.(15Banerjee R.V.

https://openalex.org/W1997483413,"While investigating the glycosylation of nuclear envelope proteins of neuroblastoma cells, we found several proteins that bound the sialic acid-specific Sambucus nigra agglutinin. The strongest signals were obtained for proteins with apparent molecular masses of 66 and 180 kDa. The specificity of the lectin binding was checked by acylneuraminyl hydrolase treatment of nuclear envelope proteins, which prohibited S. nigra agglutinin binding. Digestion of nuclear envelope proteins with the N-glycosidase F revealed that sialic acid was N-glycosidically linked to the 180-kDa protein and very probably O-glycosidically linked to the 66-kDa protein. Upon extraction, the latter behaved like the nucleoporin p62 in that it was partly extracted by high ionic strength buffers, could not be solubilized by nonionic detergent, and was completely removed from the nuclear envelope with urea. Two-dimensional gel electrophoretic comparison showed that the S. nigra agglutinin-binding protein and p62 have an identical isoelectric point of about 5.0 and an identical apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa. This, together with the binding of the anti-nucleoporin antibody, demonstrated the identity of the 66-kDa sialoprotein and p62. S. nigra agglutinin inhibits nuclear protein transport in neuroblastoma cells, strongly suggesting a functional significance of sialylation of p62."

The GST D1 protein level is four times as abundant as the GST D21 protein. The gstD1 and gstD21 genes responded rapidly to pentobarbital (PB) as changes in mRNA levels were detectable within 30 min of treatment. Maximal induction of gstD1 and gstD21 resulted in 3-fold and 20-fold elevation of their respective mRNA levels. The major mechanism for the increase in gstD1 mRNAs appears to be transcriptional activation. The 2-fold increase in the rate of gstD21 transcription, however, cannot fully account for the 20-fold increase in the steady-state level of gstD21 mRNA. Therefore, post-transcriptional mechanism(s) should also be responsible for the increase of gstD21 mRNA by PB. Because the gstD21 mRNA is relatively unstable under control conditions, induction of the intronless gstD21 mRNA by PB occurs mainly at the level of enhanced mRNA stability. The GST D1 protein level in adult Drosophila was increased approximately 2-fold after PB treatment, whereas the GST D21 level remained relatively the same.

https://openalex.org/W1981606687,"Giardia lamblia, an intestinal parasite of humans and other vertebrates, undergoes surface antigenic variation by modulating the expression of different variant-specific surface proteins (VSP). VSPs are cysteine-rich surface proteins that bind zinc and other heavy metals in vitro. We developed an immunoaffinity chromatographic method to purify a VSP in order to determine its biochemical properties. The sequences of two different proteolytic fragments agreed with the sequence deduced from the cloned gene, and amino-terminal sequence indicated the removal of a 14-residue signal peptide, consistent with the transport of VSP to the cell surface. The protein is not glycosylated and has an isoelectric point of 5.3. X-ray microanalyses indicated that the major metals in Giardia trophozoites, as well as purified VSP, are zinc and iron. The zinc concentration in Giardia cells was found to be 0.43 mM and the iron concentration 0.80 mM when compared with standard samples (zinc) or calculated from a known physical constants (iron). We propose that metal coordination stabilizes VSPs, rendering them resistant to proteolytic attack in the upper small intestine. Moreover, the ability to bind ions by Giardia may play a role in nutritional deficiency and/or malabsorption in heavily infected persons."

The repeats are arranged into rows forming rod-like structures intercalated with globular domains, with both structures constituting the short arms of the molecules (Timpl, 1989Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 487-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar; Beck et al., 1990Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Different structural domains of laminin-1 are endowed with mechanical and biological functions including induction of cell adhesion. A major cell-binding site has been located in a polypeptide fragment encompassing the carboxyl-terminal half of the laminin-1 long arm (Aumailley et al., 1987Aumailley M. Nurcombe V. Edgar D.

Moezzi H. Sonnenberg A. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and is maintained after heat denaturation of laminin-1 (Goodman et al., 1991Goodman S.L. Aumailley M. von der Mark H. J.

Due to difficulties in extracting from tissues the corresponding protein in significant quantities, information on the chemical and biological characterization of laminin-5 has been scarce. It is only recently that laminin-5 was purified from cell culture medium in amounts suitable for studies showing that laminin-5 is endowed with specific cell adhesion-promoting activity (Rousselle and Aumailley, 1994Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).We have now addressed the question of whether laminin-5 cell adhesion activity is dependent or not on a triple coil-coiled conformation, as is the case for laminin-1 (Deutzmann et al., 1990Deutzmann R. Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Pysny W. Timpl R. Edgar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis provided experimental evidence for the predicted presence of a helical conformation in laminin-5. Cell adhesion was found to be strictly dependent on the conformation and was totally abrogated by thermal denaturation of laminin-5 between 65 and 75°C.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CulturesSquamous carcinoma cells (SCC25, American Type Culture Collection) were grown in 50% Ham's F-12 medium and 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco BRL, Cergy-Pontoise, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, hydrocortisone (0.4 μg/ml), and a mixture of antibiotics. For laminin-5 purification, spent culture media were regularly harvested from confluent cultures, clarified, and kept frozen at −20°C after the addition of protease inhibitors (5 mM EDTA and 50 μM each phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and N-ethylmaleimide). Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, a mixture of antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed/Biochrom, Polylabo, Strasbourg, France) and used for cell adhesion assays as described previously (Aumailley et al., 1987Aumailley M. Nurcombe V. Edgar D. Paulsson M. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11532-11538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Laminin-5 PurificationSpent culture medium (500 ml) was passed sequentially over 25 ml of gelatin-Sepharose (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, St.-Quentin, France) and 10 ml of BM165-Sepharose (G1 fraction of monoclonal antibody BM165) (Rousselle et al., 1991Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), both equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. Material bound to BM165-Sepharose was eluted using 1 M acetic acid. Aliquots of peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)1( 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) and immunoblotting. The fractions containing laminin-5 were pooled, neutralized by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, and kept frozen at −20°C. Protein concentration was determined by the micro-bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Interchim, Montluon, France) or amino acid analysis after hydrolysis.Thermal DenaturationCircular dichroism was used to demonstrate the α-helical structure of laminin-5 and to record unfolding and refolding of the coiled-coil structure during thermal denaturation and renaturation, respectively. Laminin-5 (40 μg/ml) was in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.2. Mean residue ellipticities ([θ]R) were monitored in the far-UV spectrum from 195 to 250 nm in a Mark IV autodichrograph (ISA, Jobin Yvon, Division d'Instruments S. A.) in a 1-mm cell (Hellma, Mülheim, Federal Republic of Germany). The α-helical content was calculated according to Greenfield and Fasmann, 1969Greenfield N. Fasmann G.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar assuming that [θ]208 nm = −11,800 degrees cm2 dmol−1. Thermal transition curves were monitored from 20 to 90°C at a fixed wavelength of 220 nm with a 1-mm thermostated cell and a linear temperature gradient of 20°C/h using a thermostat (RKS20, Lauda) with an automatic programmer (PM351, Lauda) as described previously (Eble et al., 1993Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kühn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The degree of conversion was calculated as described (Bächinger et al., 1980Bächinger H.-P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).Cell Adhesion AssaysMultiwell tissue culture plates (96-well; Costar, Dutscher, France) were coated by overnight adsorption at 4°C with serial dilutions (0-40 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) of purified laminin-5, laminin-1-nidogen complex extracted from a murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor, or laminin fragment E8 (Paulsson et al., 1987Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the latter being kindly donated by Dr. R. Timpl. To study the effect of thermal denaturation, the proteins were heat-denatured for 10 min at the indicated temperature, immediately cooled, and used for coating the wells. After saturation of the wells with 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Sigma Chimie, St.-Quentin-Fallavier, France), cell adhesion assays were performed in serum-free medium, and the extent of adhesion was determined using a colorimetric method as detailed previously (Aumailley et al., 1989Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Each assay point was derived from triplicate wells.Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar using 5 or 3-5% gradient acrylamide gels. Samples were analyzed after reduction with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Ivry, France) for Western blotting according standard procedures. Antigens were detected with monoclonal antibody BM165 or a polyclonal antiserum raised in rabbits against purified human fibronectin and visualized with the corresponding anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Low molecular weight markers were from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals.Analytical ProceduresFor amino acid analysis, proteins (10 μg) were hydrolyzed (24 h, 110°C) in 6 M HCl in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol using the PicoTag workstation (Waters, Millipore Division, St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) according to standard procedures. For determination of cysteine and half-cystine residues, the samples were reduced with dithiodiglycolic acid in 0.2 M NaOH and hydrolyzed in the presence of 6 N HCl/trifluoroacetic acid/phenol (60:30:1; 16 h, 120°C) as described (Hoogerheide and Campbell, 1992Hoogerheide J.G. Campbell C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amino acid analysis was performed with a Model 6300 automated analyzer (Beckman, Gagny, France).RESULTSUsing a two-step procedure, laminin-5 was purified by affinity chromatography from spent culture media of SCC25 cells. The first chromatography over gelatin-Sepharose (25-ml bed volume) was sufficient to remove fibronectin from cell culture medium as shown by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of the eluted material (Fig. 1C). After a second chromatography on BM165-Sepharose, the eluted material was found to contain only the typical laminin-5 polypeptides of 165-155, 140, and 105 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1A). In addition, none of the laminin-5 was retained on the gelatin-Sepharose affinity column (Fig. 1B, compare lanes1 and 2).The amino acid composition of laminin-5 was determined after hydrolysis of the purified material and compared with that of the laminin-1-nidogen complex used as a control. The amino acid content of laminin-5 was very similar to that of laminin-1 except for the number of half-cystine residues, which was about two-thirds that of laminin-1 (Table I). The values were in good agreement with the theoretical composition of human laminin-5 and of the mouse laminin-1-nidogen complex calculated from the data obtained by sequencing cDNA clones corresponding to the different polypeptide chains (Sasaki et al., 1987Sasaki M.

Calculations according to Greenfield and Fasmann, 1969Greenfield N. Fasmann G.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar indicated that the helical conformation accounted for 26.9% in the native protein. Denaturation of laminin-5 by raising the temperature to 90°C was followed by a loss of the signal for ellipticity. Partial refolding was observed after gradually lowering the temperature back to 20°C (Fig. 2). The melting curve monitored at 220 nm exhibited a transition temperature at 72°C (Fig. 3).Figure 2:Circular dichroism spectrum of laminin-5.

The melting temperature is indicated by a verticaldashedline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the role of the coil-coiled structures in the cell adhesion-promoting activity of laminin-5, dose-response curves were constructed with HT1080 cells adhering to coats of the native protein or of the protein denatured by heating at various temperatures ranging from 55 to 85°C with a 5°C increment (data not shown). The maximal adhesion obtained in each dose-response curve was then expressed as a percent of the maximal adhesion recorded for cells adhering to native laminin-5 (Fig. 4). Maximal cell adhesion-promoting activity of laminin-5 gradually decreased after heating the protein at temperatures above 65°C and was completely abolished at 75°C. Similar experiments were performed with the laminin-1-nidogen complex or with its major cell-binding domain, laminin-1 fragment E8 (Fig. 4). A strict dependence on the conformation was observed for cell adhesion to fragment E8, which confirmed previous results (Deutzmann et al., 1990Deutzmann R. Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Pysny W. Timpl R. Edgar D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; Goodman et al., 1991Goodman S.L. Aumailley M. von der Mark H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the cell adhesion-promoting activity of fragment E8 was destroyed at a lower temperature (between 60 and 65°C) than that of laminin-5. Parallel analysis of thermal denaturation-dependent cell adhesion to the laminin-1-nidogen complex showed that the transition occurred as for fragment 8 between 60 and 65°C, but that a residual cell adhesion activity about half that of the unheated protein was maintained above 65°C.Figure 4:Cell adhesion activity of laminin-5, the laminin-1-nidogen complex, and laminin-1 fragment E8 after heat denaturation performed at various temperatures. Multiwell plates were coated with laminin-5 (●), the laminin-1-nidogen complex (○), or laminin-1 fragment E8 (■) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 μg/ml prior or after heating at the indicated temperatures. HT1080 cells were seeded onto triplicate wells, and the extent of adhesion was determined after 30 min of incubation using a colorimetric assay. The plateau values observed for dose-response curves at each temperature were recorded and are expressed as a percent of the adhesion obtained using unheated coats (25°C). Each point represents the average of triplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONBy its localization to anchoring filaments, laminin-5 is supposed to play major mechanical and biological roles. The former is based on the fact that there is a lack of or alterations in anchoring filaments and an absence of immunoreactivity toward monoclonal antibody GB3 (Verrando et al., 1991Verrando P. Blanchet-Bardon C. Pisani A. Thomas L. Cambazard F. Eady R.A. Schofield O. Ortonne J.-P. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 85-91PubMed Google Scholar), a laminin-5-specific antibody, in hereditary forms of epidermolysis bullosa junctionalis, a lethal blistering disease characterized by intracutaneous splits within the lamina lucida of skin basement membranes. Recently, mutations in the γ2-chain gene (LAMC2) of patients affected with this disease have been reported (Pulkkinen et al., 1994Pulkkinen L. Christiano A.M. Airenne T. Haakana H. Tryggvason K. Uitto J. Nature Genetics. 1994; 6: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar; Aberdam et al., 1994Aberdam D. Galliano M.-F. Vailly J. Pulkkinen L. Bonifas J. Christiano A.M. Tryggvason K. Uitto J. Epstein Jr., E.H. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Nature Genetics. 1994; 6: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), indicating that a structural defect in or an absence of laminin-5 in the tissue could impair the cohesion between basal epidermal cells and the underlying basement membrane. Early reports had suggested that kalinin/laminin-5 could have cell adhesion-promoting activity (Rousselle et al., 1991Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar; Carter et al., 1991Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have been recently completed, allowing predictions to be made on the structure of laminin-5. We provide here experimental evidence supporting these predictions. Amino acid analysis of laminin-5 showed that the half-cystine content was about two-thirds that of the laminin-1-nidogen complex (4.1% versus 6.1%). This difference is in good agreement with the data obtained from sequencing cDNA clones and confirm that a smaller number of cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor-like motifs should be present in the amino-terminal ends of the protein. The circular dichroism spectrum of laminin-5 indicated that it contains a high content of α-helical structures, in agreement with the presence of heptad repeats in the sequences of the α3-, β3-, and γ2-chains. The α-helix content was calculated according to Greenfield and Fasmann, 1969Greenfield N. Fasmann G.A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3302) Google Scholar assuming that [θ]208 nm = −11,800 degrees cm2 dmol−1 and was found to be 26.9%, a value similar to that reported for native laminin-1 (Ott et al., 1982Ott U.

The muscle isozyme is potently activated by either phosphorylation or AMP. In contrast, the brain isozyme is poorly activated by phosphorylation and its phosphorylated a form is more sensitive to AMP activation when enzyme activity is measured in substrate concentrations and temperatures encountered in the brain. The nonphosphorylated b form of the brain isozyme also differs from the muscle isozyme b form in its stronger affinity and lack of cooperativity for AMP. To identify the structural determinants involved, six enzyme forms, including four chimeric enzymes containing exchanges in amino acid residues 1-88, 89-499, and 500-842 (C terminus), were constructed from rabbit muscle and human brain phosphorylase cDNAs, expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Kinetic analysis of the b forms indicated that the brain isozyme amino acid 1-88 and 89-499 regions each contribute in an additive fashion to the formation of an AMP site with higher intrinsic affinity but weakened cooperativity, while the same regions of the muscle isozyme each contribute to greater allosteric coupling but weaker AMP affinity. Kinetic analysis of the a forms indicated that the amino acid 89-499 region correlated with the reduced response of the brain isozyme to activation by phosphorylation and the resultant increased sensitivity of the a form to activation by saturating levels of AMP. This isozyme-specific response also correlated with the glycogen affinity of the a forms. Enzymes containing the brain isozyme amino acid 89-499 region exhibited markedly reduced glycogen affinities in the absence of AMP compared to enzymes containing the corresponding muscle isozyme region. Additionally, AMP led to greater increases in glycogen affinity of the former set of enzymes. In contrast, phosphate affinities of all a forms were similar in the absence of AMP and increased approximately the same extent in AMP. The potential importance of a number of isozyme-specific substitutions in these sequence regions is discussed.

Kinetic analysis of the b forms indicated that the brain isozyme amino acid 1-88 and 89-499 regions each contribute in an additive fashion to the formation of an AMP site with higher intrinsic affinity but weakened cooperativity, while the same regions of the muscle isozyme each contribute to greater allosteric coupling but weaker AMP affinity. Kinetic analysis of the a forms indicated that the amino acid 89-499 region correlated with the reduced response of the brain isozyme to activation by phosphorylation and the resultant increased sensitivity of the a form to activation by saturating levels of AMP. This isozyme-specific response also correlated with the glycogen affinity of the a forms. Enzymes containing the brain isozyme amino acid 89-499 region exhibited markedly reduced glycogen affinities in the absence of AMP compared to enzymes containing the corresponding muscle isozyme region. Additionally, AMP led to greater increases in glycogen affinity of the former set of enzymes. In contrast, phosphate affinities of all a forms were similar in the absence of AMP and increased approximately the same extent in AMP. The potential importance of a number of isozyme-specific substitutions in these sequence regions is discussed."

For the native enzyme (α/β1), the ATP-dependent reaction proceeds about 4-fold more slowly in the absence of Na than when saturating concentrations of Na are present. Hybrid pumps were formed from either the α1 or the α3 subunit isoforms of Na/K-ATPase and a chimeric β subunit containing the transmembrane segment of the Na/K-ATPase β1 isoform and the external domain of the gastric H/K-ATPase β subunit (α/NHβ1 complexes). In the absence of Na, these complexes show a rate of ATP-dependent ouabain binding from 75-100% of the rate seen in the presence of Na depending on buffer conditions. Nonhydrolyzable nucleotides or treatment of ATP with apyrase abolishes ouabain binding, demonstrating that ouabain binding to α/NHβ1 complexes requires phosphorylation of the protein. Buffer ions inhibit ouabain binding by α/NHβ1 in the absence of Na rather than promote ouabain binding, indicating that they are not substituting for sodium ions in the phosphorylation reaction. The pH dependence of ATP-dependent ouabain binding in the presence or absence of Na is similar, suggesting that protons are probably not substituting for Na. Hybrid α/NHβ1 pumps also show slightly higher apparent affinities (2-3-fold) for ATP, Na, and ouabain; however, these are not sufficient to account for the increase in ouabain binding in the absence of Na. In contrast to phosphoenzyme formation and ouabain binding by α/NHβ1 complexes in the absence of Na, ATPase activity, measured as release of phosphate from ATP, requires Na. These data suggest that the transition from E1P to E2P during the catalytic cycle does not occur when the sodium binding sites are not occupied.

INTRODUCTIONThe β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids requires both 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, in addition to the enzymes required for saturated fatty acid degradation (1Schulz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Osmundsen H. Bremer J. Pedersen J.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes contain a trifunctional enzyme possessing Δ2-enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activities (3Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (4Dommes V. Baumgart C. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8259-8262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a different protein from the two mitochondrial isoforms of this enzyme (5Hakkola E.H. Hiltunen J.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In their comparative studies on peroxisomal β-oxidation of different unsaturated fatty acids, Osmundsen and his colleagues (6Hiltunen J.K. Kärki T. Hassinen I.E. Osmundsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16484-16493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hovik R. Osmundsen H. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported that the amount of acid-soluble radioactivity produced from [1-14C]arachidonate was frequently less than from other 1-14C-labeled acids. We also observed that the rate of production of acid-soluble radioactivity from [1-14C]5,8,11,14-20:4 was considerably less than that from [1-14C]9,12-18:2 or [1-14C]7,10,13,16-22:4 (8Baykousheva S.P. Luthria D.L. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18390-18394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When tritium-labeled arachidonic acid was incubated with peroxisomes, Hiltunen et al. (6Hiltunen J.K. Kärki T. Hassinen I.E. Osmundsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16484-16493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not detect any 18-carbon catabolite but a compound did accumulate that they suggested was either 5,8-14:2 or 4,7,10-16:3. We carried out similar studies and were able to characterize both 4,7,10-16:3 and 2-trans-4,7,10-16:4 (8Baykousheva S.P. Luthria D.L. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18390-18394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When [U-14C]9,12-18:2 was incubated with peroxisomes, both 7,10-16:2 and 5,8-14:2 accumulated (8Baykousheva S.P. Luthria D.L. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18390-18394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).According to the classical pathways of unsaturated fatty acid degradation, 7,10-16:2 and 3,6,9,12-18:4 would be formed, respectively, after one cycle of 9,12-18:2 and 5,8,11,14-20:4 β-oxidation. However, Tserng and Jin (9Tserng K.-Y. Jin S.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11614-11620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in mitochondria the double bond at position 5, in a number of monounsaturated fatty acids, was directly removed via a nucleotide-dependent 5-reductase. This pathway has now been modified to show that it requires NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, an enzyme which previously was thought to be required for double bond removal only at even-numbered carbons (1Schulz H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, a new enzyme, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase is required (10Smeland J.E. Nada M. Cuebas D.

In the study reported here, we show that, during the peroxisomal β-oxidation of arachidonate, the removal of odd-numbered double bonds requires both NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsATP, NAD+, NADPH, CoASH, Hepes, dithiothreitol, TES1( 1The abbreviations used are: TESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometry12-HETE12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-20:415-HETE15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-20:4.) , and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were from Sigma.

The nuclei and mitochondria obtained by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and 3,300 × g for 10 min were discarded. The light mitochondrial pellet that sedimented at 25,000 × g for 15 min was washed with the homogenizing buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 12 min. One more washing was done under the same conditions, except that the centrifugation time was reduced to 10 min. The light mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in the homogenizing medium in a volume corresponding to 1 ml/g liver. Two ml of this suspension was layered on 15 ml of 35% Nycodenz (w/v), containing 10 mM TES, 0.1% ethanol, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 56,000 × g for 50 min. The peroxisomal pellet was suspended in the incubation medium which contained 130 mM KCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 3 mg/ml. Protein was assayed with the Coomassie Blue reagent (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified mitochondria were isolated according to the procedure of Johnson and Lardy (18Johnson D. Lardy H.A.

Reactions were initiated by addition of the sodium salt of the fatty acid (2 Ci/mol) bound to bovine serum albumin in a 2:1 molar ratio. Substrate concentration varied from 12.5 to 150 μM. Reactions were terminated after 2 min by addition of 1 ml of Dole's reagent (isopropyl alcohol/heptane/0.1 N H2SO4, 40:10:1, v/v), followed by 0.35 ml of water and 0.6 ml of heptane (21Bar-Tana J.

Reactions were initiated by addition of the sodium salt of the fatty acid (2 Ci/mol) that was bound to bovine serum albumin in a 2:1 molar ratio. The final concentration of fatty acid was always 100 μM. Aliquots of 200 μl were removed and added to an equal volume of 5% HClO4. After 30 min at 4°C, the samples were centrifuged and 200 μl was counted to measure acid-soluble radioactivity.Metabolite Isolation and CharacterizationLarge scale incubations were always carried out without NAD+, but with and without NADPH in order to isolate metabolites for characterization. For each milliliter of incubation medium, 1.7 ml of MeOH and 0.25 ml of 4 N NaOH was added. The contents were stirred overnight, acidified with 0.25 ml of 6 N HCl, and 3.4 ml of CHCl3 was added. The bottom layer was taken to dryness under N2, and the free fatty acids were esterified by stirring them overnight with 5% anhydrous HCl in MeOH (w/v). The methyl esters were recovered by extraction with hexane. They were separated by reverse phase HPLC by eluting a 0.46 × 25 cm Zorbax ODS column with various concentrations of acetonitrile/water. The effluent (1 ml/min) was mixed with ScintiVerse LC (Fisher) (3 ml/min), and metabolites were detected with a Beckman 171 radioisotope detector. Appropriate fractions were collected from the column effluent, the acetonitrile was removed under N2, and the metabolites were recovered by extraction with 20% diethyl ether in hexane. Trace amounts of water were removed by passing the combined extract through a Pasteur pipette packed with granular Na2SO4. Ultraviolet spectra were measured in MeOH using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer. The methyl esters of 3-hydroxy fatty acids were further derivatized by reacting them with equal volumes of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Pierce Chemical Co.) and pyridine for 30 min at 60°C. Mass spectrometry was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard Model 5970 mass selective detector and a 5770 gas chromatograph containing a 30 m × 0.25 mm inside diameter, DB5-ms column (J and W Scientific). Injections were made in isooctane in the splitless mode at 70°C, and, after 3 min, the oven temperature was programmed to increase, at 20°C/min to 200°C.RESULTSDuring the β-oxidation of arachidonate, the synthesis of the acyl-CoA derivatives of 5,8-14:2 and 4,7,10-16:3 occurs by a CoASH-dependent thiolytic cleavage of precursor 3-ketoacyl-CoAs, rather than by ATP-dependent activation. Rates of activation of 5,8-14:2, 4,7,10-16:3, and arachidonate were, respectively, 746, 557, and 283 nmol/min/mg of peroxisomal protein. Since activation rates were high, it was assumed that acyl-CoA formation with all three substrates was not rate-limiting when β-oxidation was assayed.The results in Fig. 1 show that the generation of acid-soluble radioactivity formed during the β-oxidation of [1-14C]5,8-14:2 was greater than for [1-14C]5,8,11,14-20:4. These data suggest that the chain length of the substrate plays a more important role in regulating β-oxidation than does a double bond at position 5. The generation of acid-soluble radioactivity from [1-14C]4,7,10-16:3 requires the participation of NADPH-dependent 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. As shown in Fig. 1, there was a time dependent increase in the rate of β-oxidation when incubations were carried out in the absence of NADPH. When NADPH was added to the incubation, there was an increase in the generation of acid-soluble radioactivity. Similar results were obtained when the rate of β-oxidation of [1-14C]4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6 was compared with and without NADPH (6Hiltunen J.K. Kärki T. Hassinen I.E. Osmundsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16484-16493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).When [1-14C]4,7,10-16:3 was incubated with the NAD+ generating system and NADPH, the HPLC radiochromatogram in Fig. 2A shows that three radioactive metabolites eluted immediately prior to compound 4 which is residual substrate. When [1-14C]4-10:1, a product that would be produced after five cycles of arachidonate β-oxidation, was incubated under identical conditions, it was possible to detect only one metabolite in addition to unreacted substrate (Fig. 3). The metabolite was isolated and its ultraviolet and mass spectra were identical with authentic methyl 2-trans-4-cis-10:2. When [1-14C]4,7,10-16:3 was incubated without nucleotides, there was an increase in the accumulation of metabolites versus when the complete system was used (Fig. 2, A versus B). These incubation conditions were then used to accumulate sufficient amounts of metabolites for characterization. The ultraviolet spectrum of the methyl ester of compound 3 (Fig. 4A) was identical with that of methyl 2-trans-4-cis-10:2 (Fig. 4B). The mass spectrum of the methyl ester had a base peak of m/z 79, a small molecular ion at m/z 262 (2%) with other small ions at m/z 230 (M - 32; 1%) and m/z 231 (M - 31; 1%). Compound 3 is thus methyl 2-trans-4,7,10-16:4. The ultraviolet spectrum of compound 2, as shown in Fig. 5, had three absorbance maxima at 257, 267, and 277 nm showing that it contained three conjugated double bonds, none of which were in conjugation with the carbonyl carbon (23Kates M. Work T.S. Work E. Techniques of Lipidology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1972: 383Google Scholar). Its mass spectrum differed from compound 3 primarily in that the molecular ion at m/z 262 was more intense; i.e. 32%, and the base peak was at m/z 91. The ultraviolet and the mass spectra of compound 1 were similar with compound 2 (data not shown). The initial product formed during the β-oxidation of 4,7,10-16:3 is 2-trans-4,7,10-16:4; i.e. compound 3. Isomerization of the 2-trans-4-cis-double bonds, by reversing the reaction catalyzed by Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, would yield 3,5,7,10-16:4. Two isomeric products with this general structure were characterized, but as yet it has not been possible to determine the configuration of the double bonds in compounds 1 and 2 in Fig. 2A and 2B.Figure 2:Radiochromatograms obtained when 100 μM [1-14C]4,7,10-16:3 was incubated with 300 μg of peroxisomal protein with (A) and without (B) NAD+ and NADPH.

Experiments were then designed to determine if the double bond at position 5 was removed via the classical pathway of β-oxidation or if Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase was required. Diczfalusy et al. (24Diczfalusy J. Alexson S.E. Sisfontes L. lund J. Bjorkhem I. Biochim. Biophys.

When we incubated [1-14C]6,9,12-18:3 with peroxisomes, without NAD+ and NADPH, a polar metabolite accumulated. The mass spectrum of the methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ether derivative had a weak molecular ion at m/z 380 (1%) and a major ion at m/z 365 (M - 15; 30%) showing that it is 3-hydroxy-6,9,12-18:3. In a similar way, the mass spectrum of the polar metabolite derived from [1-14C]7,10,13,16-22:4 had a molecular ion at m/z 434 (2%) and a major ion at m/z 419 (M - 15; 37%). This compound is thus 3-hydroxy-7,10,13,16-22:4.The above data show that when polyunsaturated fatty acids, with their first double bond at position 6, 7, or 9, are incubated with peroxisomes, in the absence of NAD+, that the expected 3-hydroxy metabolite accumulates. When [1-14C]5,8,11,14-20:4 was incubated under the above conditions, the HPLC radiochromatogram in Fig. 6A shows that it was not possible to detect a polar metabolite. Two small radioactive peaks eluted, respectively, at 22.7 and 24 min. The major metabolite, which eluted immediately prior to unmetabolized arachidonate, had an ultraviolet spectrum (Fig. 4C) identical with methyl 2-trans-4-cis-10:2 (Fig. 4B). The mass spectrum of the methyl ester had a weak molecular ion at m/z 316, which is two mass units less than for methyl 5,8,11,14-20:4. Compound 3 is thus 2-trans-4,8,11,14-20:5, which cannot be produced from arachidonate via the classical pathway of β-oxidation since one cycle of β-oxidation would yield 3,6,9,12-18:4, using only the enzymes required for saturated fatty acid degradation. The accumulation of 2-trans-4,8,11,14-20:5 further implies that peroxisomes have Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity. If the dienoyl-CoA isomerase-NADPH-dependent reductase pathway is required to remove the double bond at position 5 from arachidonate, the synthesis of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA would require NADPH. The HPLC radiochromatogram in Fig. 6B shows that it was possible to detect seven radioactive metabolites when [1-14C]5,8,11,14-20:4 was incubated with peroxisomes in the presence of NADPH in addition to unmetabolized substrate (compound 5). Under these conditions, it was not possible to detect acid-soluble radioactivity, which would require a complete cycle of β-oxidation. The mass spectrum of the methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ether of compound 1 had a molecular ion at m/z 408 (6%) and a major ion at m/z 393 (M - 15; 47%). Its spectrum was identical with that of the methyl ester-trimethylsilyl derivative of synthetic 3-hydroxy-8,11,14-20:3. Compound 4 is methyl 2-trans-4,8,11,14-20:5. Compounds 7 and 8 were identified by comparing their retention times on HPLC and their mass spectra with authentic standards. They are, respectively, methyl 2-trans-8,11,14-20:4 and methyl 8,11,14-20:3.Figure 6:HPLC radiochromatograms of the products obtained when 100 μM [1-14C]5,8,11,14-20:4 was incubated without (A) and with (B) NADPH.

They were collected together and, when analyzed by GC-MS, it was possible to detect two compounds, both of which had molecular ions at m/z 236, which is two mass units less than for the molecular ion of methyl 5,8-14:2. The major radioactive compound had a retention time identical with methyl [1-14C]5,8-14:2. When it was isolated and analyzed by GC-MS, two compounds were separated, one of which was unmetabolized substrate while the second compound had a molecular ion at m/z 236. The ultraviolet spectrum of this composite sample (Fig. 4D) shows that it contains methyl 2-trans-4,8-14:3. Since the compounds eluting at 13.7 and 14.4 min also had molecular ions at m/z 236, they undoubtedly are 2-trans-5,8-14:3 and 3,5,8-14:3. It was not possible to obtain satisfactory mass spectra of the analogous 5,8,11,14-20:4 metabolites, i.e. compounds 2 and 3 (Fig. 6B); but, most likely, they are methyl 2-trans-5,8,11,14-20:5 and 3,5,8,11,14-20:5.Figure 7:HPLC radiochromatograms of the products produced when 100 μM [1-14C]5,8-14:2 was incubated without (A) and with (B) NADPH.

The mass spectrum of the methyl ester-trimethylsilyl ether of compound 1 had a molecular ion at m/z 328 (2%) and an ion at m/z 313 (M - 15; 27%) showing that it is 3-hydroxy-8-14:1. Compounds 2 and 3 are 2-trans-5,8-14:3 and 3,5,8-14:3. Again, compound 4 was a mixture of unmetabolized methyl 5,8-14:2 and methyl 2-trans-4,8-14:3. Compound 5, which corresponds to the uncharacterized arachidonate-derived metabolite (compound 6; Fig. 6B) was also not identified. Compounds 6 and 7 had molecular ions respectively at m/z 238 and 240. By analogy with the arachidonate-derived metabolites, these undoubtedly are methyl 2-trans-8-14:2 and methyl 8-14:1.DISCUSSIONIt is not known in vivo how arachidonate distributes itself between mitochondria and peroxisomes for β-oxidation. Several types of evidence suggest that peroxisomes play a major role in this process. Studies using a variety of cells have shown that the lipoxygenase products, 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-20:4 (12-HETE) and 15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-20:4 (15-HETE), are β-oxidized (25Hadjiagapiou C. Sprecher H.

With both substrates, the major or the only catabolite that accumulated had its first double bond at position 4, i.e. from 12-HETE it was 8-hydroxy-4,6,10-16:3 and from 15-HETE it was 11-hydroxy-4,7,9-16:3. When liver peroxisomes were incubated with 12-HETE, 8-hydroxy-4,6,10-16:3 accumulated as the sole catabolite (29Wigren J. Herbertsson H. Tollbom S. Hammarström S. J.

https://openalex.org/W2011990607,"The role of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) on negative thyroid hormone response elements (nTREs) is not well understood. In this report, we demonstrate that an orientation-specific monomeric thyroid hormone receptor (T3R) DNA-binding site mediates thyroid hormone inhibition in the thyrotropin β subunit gene (TSH-β) from human and murine species. Unlike positive TREs, addition of the ligand 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) to cells transfected with a T3R β1 expression vector significantly reduces thyroid hormone inhibition of the TSH-β gene, indicating that endogenous retinoid receptors antagonize T3R function.

Unlike the role of RXR to increase heterodimer binding and enhance thyroid hormone stimulation from a pTRE, its effect on the negative TRE (nTRE) is not well understood. A major nTRE in the human, mouse, and rat TSH-β subunit genes has been described (18Wondisford F.E. Farr E.A. Radovick S. Steinfelder H.J. Moates J.M. McClaskey J.H. Weintraub B.D. J. Biol.

The human nTRE consists of two consensus half-sites situated 24 bp apart and an additional degenerate half-site (3/6) positioned 4 bp downstream from the first half-site in the first exon (20Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21666-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites are identical in the mouse and rat TSH-β genes, but their individual roles in thyroid hormone inhibition have not been fully characterized. The more 5′-T3R half-site (site 1) of this nTRE is of higher affinity than the 3′-half-site (site 2), but both sites appear to be functionally important for thyroid hormone inhibition (20Bodenner D.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18689-18694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, at site 1, T3R structurally interacts with the proto-oncogene c-jun during thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation of this gene (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Naar et al.(5Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and Hallenbeck et al. (23Hallenbeck P.L. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3825-3828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that negative regulation of the mouse TSH-β subunit gene was mediated by formation of unique T3R homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes on a somewhat different nTRE. Their proposed nTRE was a DR+2 element located at −18 to −5 bp in the mouse TSH-β gene. The more 5′-half-site of this nTRE is relatively degenerate, however, and is not conserved in either the human or rat TSH-β subunit genes. We provide evidence that the human and mouse TSH-β nTREs bind monomeric T3R, and RXR, in a ligand-dependent manner, antagonizes T3-mediated inhibition. Double-stranded 32P-labeled probes were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction and [α-32P]dCTP (400 Ci/mM) and incorporated 4-6 [α-32P]dCTP residues. Unincorporated 32P was removed by Sephadex G-25 chromatography, and the probes were purified on 5% non-denaturing gels as described (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the DNA probes used in this study. Human c-erbA-β-1 in pGEM3 and RXR-α in pBS (gift of R. Evans, Salk Institute, San Diego) were synthesized in an in vitro transcription/translation reaction (TnT kit, Promega). Unprogrammed translation reactions were used as a control. Quality and quantity of translated proteins were assessed by [35S]methionine labeling and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Binding reactions were performed in a 15-μl volume of binding buffer (20% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. 30,000-50,000 cpm of probe was added to each reaction with 3 μl of programmed or unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate for 30 min at room temperature. “Supershifts” were performed using 2 μl of either polyclonal anti-TRβ-1 (Affinity Bioreagents, Meshanic St., NJ) or anti-c-jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) with an additional 30 min of incubation at 4°C. Electrophoresis was performed on a 5% non-denaturing gel containing 5% glycerol as previously described (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations noted in Fig. 1 were introduced into either a −125/+37-bp human TSH-β or a −124/+4-bp mouse TSH-β promoter fragment utilizing polymerase chain reaction and mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotides. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Human or mouse TSH-β promoter fragments were cloned into a luciferase vector at the HindIII site as previously described (20Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21666-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human T3R β1 and RXR-α cDNAs were inserted as EcoRI fragments into the pKCR2 vector as described (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RXR-α deletion mutant cDNAs were constructed by deleting either an NcoI or StuI fragment from the full-length cDNA and inserting these cDNAs into pKCR2. The human RAR-α cDNA in the pCDM8 expression vector was a gift of Dr. Benjamin Neel (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston). Transient transfection of choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 was performed using methods previously described (20Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21666-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol.

Cell culture medium contained 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) treated with either anion exchange resin (50 mg/ml AGX-8, Bio-Rad) for two separate periods of at least 5 h each or anion exchange resin as before with the addition of activated charcoal (100 mg/ml, Sigma) with the second anion exchange resin treatment. The resin and charcoal were then removed, and the serum was filter-sterilized prior to its addition to the cell culture medium. The focus of this study was site 1 in the nTRE of the TSH-β gene from different species. The WT nTRE and mutations within and around site 1 in the nTRE were tested for their ability to bind T3R and RXR in gel mobility studies. The WT nTRE (Fig. 2) bound in vitro translated T3R (human c-erbA-β-1) as a monomer (M); the migration position of a monomeric T3R complex was established by comparison to the nTRE containing a DR+4 mutation (Fig. 3), which formed both monomeric and dimeric (D) T3R complexes. Using the Δ3/7 mutation, which eliminated T3R binding at site 1, we have previously shown (20Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21666-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that monomeric T3R bound predominantly to this half-site in the WT nTRE. As expected, when site 1 was reversed (M1R), a monomeric T3R binding pattern identical to the WT nTRE was observed (data not shown). The nonspecific complex (NS) found with unprogrammed lysate migrated slightly above the heterodimer band and was not “supershifted” by the anti-TRβ-1 antiserum (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the DR+5 DNA fragment (Fig. 4), which contains an additional consensus T3R binding half-site 5 bp downstream from site 1 (Fig. 1), bound both one (M) and two monomers (2M) of T3R. 10 nM T3 did not alter monomeric T3R binding on the WT nTRE (Fig. 2) but reduced dimeric T3R binding on the DR+4 element (Fig. 3), as has been previously reported (24Yen P.M.

Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Note that unlike the DR+4 probe, 10 nM T3 did not dissociate the 2 M complex on the DR+5 probe. Polyclonal anti-TRβ-1 but not anti-c-jun antiserum supershifted the monomeric, two monomeric, and dimeric T3R complexes, confirming their identity. In fact, polyclonal anti-TRβ-1 antibody supershifted two distinct complexes with the DR+4 probe (Fig. 3, arrows), representing a dimeric and monomeric complex but only a single complex with the WT nTRE (Fig. 2, arrow) or the DR+5 probe (Fig. 4, arrow).Figure 3:Gel mobility shift assay of the DR+4 mutant nTRE.

These data suggest that heterodimerization between T3R and RXR in solution prevents T3R binding to the WT nTRE. Identical results were obtained with the M1R DNA probes (data not shown). In contrast, the DR+4 element (Fig. 3) formed a strong heterodimeric complex when both T3R and RXR were added to the binding reaction. The DR+5 element (Fig. 4) behaved like the WT nTRE except that RXR inhibited formation of both monomeric complexes (M and 2M). 10 nM T3 did not alter heterodimer complexes on the DR+4 probe. Since the ligand for RXR is 9-cis RA (gift of A. Levin, Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), we also tested whether this ligand (13Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar, 14Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A. Cameron J.F. Lu X.P. Haefner P. Dawson M.I. Pfahl M. Science. 1992; 258: 1944-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) would alter the pattern of T3R or T3R·RXR heterodimeric binding on these elements. 1 μM 9-cis RA did not alter RXR antagonism of T3R monomeric binding on the WT nTRE or DR+5 probes or T3R·RXR heterodimeric binding on the DR+4 element (data not shown). JEG-3 cells were chosen for these studies because they are functionally deficient in T3R and have been used to investigate negative T3 regulation of the common glycoprotein α subunit and TSH-β subunit genes (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chatterjee V.K.K. Lee J. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9114-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter constructs containing −125 to +37 bp of either the WT or mutant human TSH-β nTRE were utilized in these studies. As a positive control, a luciferase reporter construct containing two copies of a T3 palindromic element (TRETK, Ref. 27Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, gift of J. L. Jameson, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago) upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter was utilized. Transfection efficiency was monitored using a cotransfected human growth hormone reporter plasmid (pTKGH); luciferase activity was expressed relative to the basal activity of the human TSH-β WT construct, except for the pTRETKLUC activity, which was expressed relative to its own basal activity. Relative luciferase activity (relative light units measured over 20 s/human growth hormone measured in culture medium in ng/ml) of TRETK, WT human TSH-β, and “promoterless” luciferase constructs was 36, 427, 2115, and 25, respectively. Transient transfection studies were performed in JEG-3 cells without and with cotransfected human c-erbA-β-1 (pKCR2-c-erbA-β, T3R). Luciferase activity from the WT −125/+37-bp human TSH-β reporter plasmid (Fig. 5) was increased by cotransfected T3R; the addition of 10 nM T3 reduced luciferase activity by 70%. 10 nM T3, in the presence of cotransfected vector, did not inhibit luciferase expression from this construct, confirming the functional absence of T3R in this cell line. We have previously shown that mutation of site 1 (Fig. 1, Δ3/7) abolished T3-mediated inhibition of the −125/+37-bp human TSH-β reporter plasmid in this cell line in the presence of cotransfected T3R (22Wondisford F.E. Steinfelder H.J. Nations M. Radovick S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2749-2754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the TRETK construct was stimulated 16-fold by T3 in the presence of cotransfected T3R (Fig. 5). Note that T3R cotransfection resulted in ligand-independent repression, not stimulation, of this construct containing a pTRE. To determine whether a DR+4 configuration at site 1 would alter T3-mediated inhibition, this mutation was constructed in the context of the human TSH-β nTRE (Fig. 1). Unlike the WT construct, cotransfection of T3R with this construct resulted in a 2-fold reduction in basal activity; T3 stimulated expression from this construct 5-fold (DR+4, Fig. 5). These data, together with those from the WT construct, indicated that unliganded monomeric T3R stimulated, while dimeric or heterodimeric T3R inhibited, transcription from the WT and mutant TSH-β TREs, respectively. Moreover, the WT nTRE was converted to a pTRE by adding a second half-site 4 bp downstream from site 1, indicating that the composition of the TRE and not its location determined the direction of thyroid hormone action. DR+5 configuration at site 1, however, resulted in a different pattern of expression (DR+5, Fig. 5). Ligand-independent activation by T3R was impaired relative to the WT construct, but T3-mediated inhibition was preserved. Since the DR+5 probe bound T3R as either one or two monomers (see Fig. 4), these data indicated that the ability of T3R to form homo- or heterodimers (DR+4 arrangement) and not just a second nearby half-site (DR+4 or DR+5 arrangement) was essential for thyroid hormone stimulation. The DR+5 arrangement, unlike the DR+4 element, would bind both RARs and RXRs present in the JEG-3 cell line, and this could explain the difference in ligand-independent activation. To determine whether the orientation of site 1 is important for T3-mediated inhibition, we constructed the M1R mutant (Fig. 1) in the −125/+37-bp human TSH-β reporter plasmid. Interestingly, this mutation abolished T3-mediated inhibition, even though the only difference between this construct and the WT construct is the orientation of the T3R-binding site 1 (M1R, Fig. 1 and Fig. 5). Since this mutant only bound monomeric T3R in gel mobility shift experiments, it suggested that the presentation of certain domains of the T3R to the transcription complex at site 1 was crucial for T3-mediated inhibition. Unlike the rat and human TSH-β subunit genes, Naar et al.(5Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) have proposed a somewhat different nTRE in the mouse. Their proposed mouse TSH-β nTRE includes site 1 present in the rat and human genes but also includes a second degenerate half-site more 5′ to site 1, which is not found in either the rat or human genes (Fig. 1). When tested in the gel mobility shift assay, the WT mouse TSH-β DNA fragment (identical to that in Ref. 5Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) formed a specific complex with T3R that migrated at the position of a T3R homodimer (Fig. 6, lane1). Using the WT mouse probe, unprogrammed lysate (data not shown) and the RXR only (lane7) did not form this band, confirming it was due to T3R binding. Two lines of evidence suggested, however, that this was not a true homodimer but represented binding of two monomers to this element. First, 10 nM T3 dissociated T3R homodimers on the mouse DR+4 element and resulted in strong monomeric binding (compare Fig. 6, lanes5 and 6) but did not dissociate the WT mouse nTRE or an idealized mouse DR+2 element (Fig. 6, lanes1 and 2 and lanes3 and 4, respectively). A lack of T3R-T3R interaction on the WT and DR+2 elements can be inferred because T3 dissociated T3R homodimers on the DR+4 but not the WT or DR+2 elements. Furthermore, T3 altered homodimeric but not monomeric T3R binding on the DR+4 element, indicating monomeric T3R-DNA interactions were not disrupted by T3. Second, we were unable to cross-link T3R on the mouse nTRE or an idealized DR+2 element using 1,6-bismaleimidohexane and previously described methods (data not shown and Ref. 20Bodenner D.L. Mroczynski M.A. Weintraub B.D. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21666-21673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data are consistent with that of Naar et al.(5Naar A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) who demonstrated no significant cross-linking of T3R on the WT mouse TSH-β nTRE. Luciferase reporter constructs containing −125 to +37 bp of either the human TSH-β, mouse TSH-β, or a mutant mouse TSH-β gene nTRE were utilized in these studies. As shown in Fig. 7, the WT human construct was inhibited 90% by 10 nM T3 in the presence of cotransfected T3R in these experiments. The WT mouse construct was inhibited 77% by 10 nM T3 in the presence of cotransfected T3R (Fig. 7). The more 5′-degenerative half-site in the mouse nTRE, however, was not important in mediating thyroid hormone inhibition, since the mutant mouse nTRE (shown in Fig. 1), which resembles the human nTRE, was inhibited to a greater extent (93%) than the WT mouse construct by 10 nM T3 (Fig. 7). These data indicate that the core monomeric site in the mouse TSH-β gene nTRE and not the DR+2 arrangement dictates negative regulation. Having defined the importance of the core monomeric T3R-binding site (site 1) of the mouse and human TSH-β gene nTREs, we next explored the role of RXR in thyroid hormone inhibition. Both Hallenbeck et al.(23Hallenbeck P.L. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3825-3828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Carr and Wong (28Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that cotransfection of RXR-β and T3R expression vectors abolished thyroid hormone inhibition of either the mouse or rat TSH-β gene nTRE. It is unclear, however, how the cell culture medium was treated in these studies to remove endogenous thyroid hormones and retinoids present in the fetal calf serum. We initially performed experiments with the WT human promoter in medium containing fetal calf serum that was treated with an anion exchange resin to remove endogenous thyroid hormones. When both T3R and RXR expression vectors were cotransfected in JEG-3 cells, no significant thyroid hormone inhibition of the WT human construct was observed (2% inhibition by 10 nM T3). To investigate further the effect of RXR on thyroid hormone receptor function, experiments were performed with medium containing serum treated with both anion exchange resin and activated charcoal to remove both endogenous thyroid hormones and retinoids. We first compared the effect of RXR-α or RAR-α and their ligand 9-cis RA on T3R activation of the WT human construct (Fig. 8). Ligand-independent activation by T3R was significantly reduced by RXR cotransfection but only in the presence of 9-cis RA. In contrast, RAR cotransfection actually enhanced ligand-independent activation by T3R in the absence of 9-cis RA and had no significant effect in the presence of 9-cis RA. These data indicate that ligand-bound RXR functionally removes the ligand-independent activation function of T3R. We next compared the ability of RXR-α or RAR-α to antagonize thyroid hormone inhibition of the WT human construct in the absence or presence of 9-cis RA (Fig. 9). As expected, transfection of either an RXR-α or RAR-α expression vector alone resulted in no T3 inhibition in either the absence of presence of 9-cis RA. Transfection of T3R alone resulted in 75% T3 inhibition, which was reduced to 50% T3 inhibition after the addition of 9-cis RA. JEG-3 cells express the RXR-α isoform almost exclusively (29Hsu J.-H. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); these data indicate that endogenous RXR-α in JEG-3 cells can antagonize thyroid hormone inhibition when occupied by its ligand, 9-cis RA. This effect was specific for RXR since cotransfection of RXR and T3R completely abolished T3 inhibition in the presence of 9-cis RA, while cotransfection of RAR and T3R yielded results similar to T3R transfection alone. These data are in contrast to those obtained with the TRETK construct. After cotransfection of RXR and T3R, T3 stimulation of this construct was similar in the absence or presence of 9-cis RA (9.3 ± 0.4- versus 9.5 ± 7-fold, respectively). Rosen et al.(30Rosen E.D. O'Donnell A.L. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22010-22013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that cotransfection of RXR enhanced T3 stimulation on a palindromic element, and this enhancement was dependent on 9-cis RA. While our data do not confirm 9-cis RA enhancement of T3 stimulation in JEG-3 cells, they do demonstrate an antagonistic role for the same ligand in T3 inhibition in these cells. To determine the mechanism of RXR antagonism of T3R action, two deletions of the RXR-α isoform were constructed and translated in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction. As shown in Fig. 10, these mutants were synthesized to a similar degree in the lysate as determined by [35S]methionine labeling. The DBD mutant lacks amino acids 29-197, and the LBD mutant lacks amino acids 403-462 and are correspondingly smaller in molecular size than WT RXR-α of approximately 52 kDa. Both mutants contain the region important in nuclear localization in this superfamily or receptors (31Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar), and these mutants localize to the nucleus based on deletion studies with the RXR-β isoform (32Segars J.H. Marks M.S. Hirschfeld S. Driggers P.H. Martinez E. Grippo J.F. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2258-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether these isoforms would antagonize thyroid hormone inhibition by T3R of the WT human TSH-β promoter. JEG-3 cells were cotransfected with T3R and RXR-α expression vectors as noted in Fig. 11. As expected, cotransfection of the full-length RXR-α expression vector abolished T3 inhibition in the presence but not in the absence of 9-cis RA. In contrast, both mutant RXRs were defective in this property. Cotransfection of the LBD mutant resulted in no significant additional antagonism of thyroid hormone inhibition by 9-cis RA compared with cotransfection of T3R alone. This result was expected since the LBD mutant lacks the ninth heptad repeat in the C terminus and does not bind as a heterodimer with T3R (33Marks M.S. Hallenbeck P.L. Nagata T. Segars J.H. Appells E. Nikodem V.M. Ozato K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1419-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 34Zhang X.-K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B.-V. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the DBD mutant resulted in some additional antagonism of T3 inhibition in the presence of 9-cis RA as compared with T3R alone but clearly less than the full-length RXR. Given that both an intact DNA and ligand binding domain of RXR were necessary for ligand-dependent antagonism of thyroid hormone inhibition, we wanted to determine how these RXR mutants affected heterodimer binding to both positive and negative TREs. Both RXR mutants were defective in heterodimer formation with T3R on a DR+4 probe (Fig. 12) but did not affect homodimer binding to this element. In contrast, the WT RXR and DBD mutant (to a lesser extent) but not the LBD mutant removed monomeric T3R binding to the WT TSH-β nTRE (Fig. 12). Addition of 9-cis RA did not alter the effect of RXR-α and its mutants on either the DR+4 or TSH-β probes (data not shown). Because reticulocyte lysate should contain 9-cis RA, it is unclear whether 9-cis RA affects heterodimer formation between RXR and T3R on DNA or in solution. Fig. 13 is a model of RXR action on positive and negative TREs. RXR enhances T3R binding to pTREs via a DNA-binding element containing appropriately spaced half-sites (A) in gel shift studies. Both T3 and 9-cis RA may activate transcription by altering the conformation of the heterodimer and allow it to interact with either an adaptor protein or the basal transcriptional machinery (B). In contrast, we suggest that the TSH-β nTRE is a monomeric T3R DNA-binding element in human and murine species, binding one or several molecules of T3R. RXR removes T3R binding to this nTRE and antagonizes both ligand-independent activation by T3R as well as T3-mediated inhibition (C and D). The importance of the monomer in this process is further strengthened by the orientation dependence of the half-site in the nTRE for inhibition and the ability of a second appropriately spaced half-site to convert a nTRE to a pTRE. RXR antagonism of negative TREs is strictly dependent on an intact DNA- and ligand-binding domain of RXR and the ligand 9-cis RA. In conclusion, this is the first demonstration of 9-cis RA-dependent antagonism of thyroid hormone inhibition via negative TREs."

One of these clones, Ash-ψ, was an unusual transcribed gene having 93% identity in the nucleotide sequence to Ash-l. The other two clones, Ash-m and -s, had nucleotide sequences identical with Ash-l cDNA in the amino-terminal region. The coding sequence of Ash-m cDNA is 42 nucleotides shorter than that of Ash-l cDNA. The defective region of Ash-m cDNA encodes 14 amino acid residues (157 to 170 of Ash-l), which comprise the most conserved region of the second SH3 domain.

Cloning of the genomic DNA of the Ash-l-encoding gene, determination of the gene organization, and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the two isoforms, as well as Ash-l, are generated from a single gene by unusual alternative splicings.

Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar was shown to be a key molecule, which exists between downstream of an epidermal growth factor receptor-like tyrosine kinase and upstream of a Ras protein and is essential for signalings of vulval formation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This gene, sem-5, encodes the protein (Sem-5), which consists almost exclusively of a single SH21( 1The abbreviations used are: SHSrc homologyPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorSosson of sevenlessPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseBrdUrd5-bromo-2-deoxyuridinePIphosphatidylinositolbpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) domain and two SH3 domains. Since SH2 domains recognize phosphotyrosine residues in tyrosine kinase receptors, Sem-5 became the most likely candidate for the molecule that couples the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded with Ras signaling. A mammalian counterpart of Sem-5, Ash-l/Grb-2, was identified independently by two groups using different strategies. Matuoka et al., 1992Matuoka K. Shibata M. Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl.

The evidence that Ash-l/Grb-2 links tyrosine kinase receptors with Ras signaling has been obtained from the direct association of Ash-l with Sos (guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras) (Egan et al., 1993Egan S.E.

Thus, it is demonstrated that Ash-l is the adaptor molecule that physically associates with mSos, allowing ligand-activated tyrosine kinase receptors to modulate Ras activity. A recent study has shown that injection of the antibody against Ash-l into cells abolishes the reorganization of actin stress fibers (Matuoka et al., 1993Matuoka K. Shibasaki F. Shibata M. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3467-3473Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), controlled by Rac proteins (Ridley and Hall, 1992Ridley A.J. Hall A.

In addition, dynamin, which stimulates GTPase activity by binding to microtubules, also binds to Ash-l through the SH3 domains (Gout et al., 1993Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G.

These findings raise the possibility that Ash-l functions not only in Ras signaling but also in other pathways. Since the SH3 domains function to mediate signals downstream of Ash-l, differences in the binding specificities of the two SH3 domains to various signaling molecules will regulate the signal direction. Therefore, we thought that it would be worthwhile to search for Ash-l isoforms, especially those having SH3 domains different from the original. In the present paper, we describe the isolation of splicing isoforms of Ash-l, the generation mechanism of the isoforms as revealed by genomic cloning of the Ash-l-encoding gene, and the roles of these isoforms in mitogenic signaling.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Ash/Grb2 Isoform cDNAsA rat fetal brain cDNA library (E15) in Zap II vector was screened with 32P-labeled Ash-l cDNA. Conditions for the transfer of phage plaques to nitrocellulose filters and fixation of DNA were essentially the same as the standard protocols (Maniatis et al., 1982Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed in 5 × SSC, 30% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate at 42°C overnight. The filters were washed three times in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and then at 55°C twice. Autoradiography was conducted at −70°C overnight using Kodak XAR film with an intensifying screen. Conversion of phage to plasmid was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. Preparation of the plasmid DNA was carried out as described (Watanabe et al., 1992Watanabe K. Nomoto M. Nagata S. Itoh Y. Hikichi K. Maruyama N. Mita T. Senshu T. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Isolation of Ash-l Genomic Clones2 × 106 recombinant phages of a Wistar rat genomic library, previously reported (Watanabe et al., 1992Watanabe K. Nomoto M. Nagata S. Itoh Y. Hikichi K. Maruyama N. Mita T. Senshu T. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were screened with 32P-labeled Ash-l and Ash-m cDNAs. The conditions of phage transfer to filters, hybridization, and washing were the same as those used in the cDNA screening described above.Nucleotide SequencingRecombinant pBluescript plasmids containing the cDNA inserts were digested with appropriate pairs of restriction enzymes to generate 5′- and 3′-protruding ends at unique sites in the polylinker region. The resulting linearized DNA was treated with exonuclease III and S1 nuclease to effect various extents of deletion (Guo and Wu, 1983Guo L.-H. Wu R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 60-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses were performed using double-stranded DNA by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar; Messing et al., 1981Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 10: 1755-1769Google Scholar).PCR ExperimentTissues used to extract total RNAs were cerebrum, cerebellum, thymus, spleen, heart, lung, liver, kidney, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, skeletal muscle, and testis. The total RNAs were isolated by the method of Chirgwin et al., 1979Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16619) Google Scholar. RNA PCR was performed using GeneAmp™ RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The oligonucleotide primers used to discriminate Ash-l and Ash-m mRNAs in the total RNAs were 5′-ATGAAACCACATCCGTGGTTTTTTGGCAAAATCC-3′ (oligo-2 in Fig. 1a) and 5′-ATCTCTTTTGCTTCTTAGACGTTCC-3′ (oligo-5). The regions chosen to synthesize the primers are indicated by convergent arrows in Fig. 1a. The PCR cycle condition was as follows: one cycle of 94°C for 4 min, 50°C for 5 min, and 72°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 3 min, and finally followed by 72°C for 7 min. The reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used to detect Ash-s mRNAs were 5′-GCTCAGAATGGAAGCCAT-3′ and 5′-CTATATAGGCCTTGTTCCCCTAAGC-3′. The products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with the labeled probe, 5′-CATAGAAATGAAACCACATCC-3′.Production and Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins of Ash-m, Ash-s, and Carboxyl-terminal SH3s of Ash-l and Ash-mThe coding regions of Ash-s and -m were amplified by PCR. The oligo-1 primer was synthesized with a BamHI site at the 5′-end. Ash-m coding fragments were amplified in the same manner as Ash-s except that the oligonucleotide from the carboxyl-terminal region of Ash-l (oligo-5) was utilized as a 3′-primer. Both PCR fragments for Ash-s and -m were inserted between the BamHI and SmaI sites of pBluescript KS−, amplified in XL1-Blue, and excised between the BamHI site in the PCR primer and an EcoRI site in the polylinker region of the vector. The fragments were inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of a pGEX-3X expression vector. Similarly, DNA fragments coding the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domains of Ash-l and Ash-m were amplified using synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GTTGGATCCTGTCCAGGAACCAGCAG-3′ (nucleotide 419-435 of Ash-l with the BamHI restriction site) and 5′-AAAGAATCCTTAGACGTTCCGGTTC-3′ (nucleotide 639-654 of Ash-l with the EcoRI site) as primers. The resulting 254-bp (Ash-l) and 212-bp (Ash-m) products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI, then ligated into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of PGEX-3X expression vector. Bacteria-harboring plasmids were precultured in M9-ZB medium at 37°C overnight. On the next day, the bacteria were diluted to A600 = 0.1 with medium, and culture was continued until the A600 value was between 0.5 and 0.6. Protein production was then induced by adding 1 M isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (0.5 ml/500 ml culture medium) to the culture medium. After 5 h, the bacteria were harvested and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and 1% Triton X-100. The extracts were sonicated vigorously and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The resultant supernatants were applied to a glutathione-agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) column. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ash fusion proteins were eluted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 25 mM glutathione.Production of GST-Phospholipase C γ1(SH3) and GST-Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 85-kDa Subunit (SH3)The cDNA encoding phospholipase C γ1 was digested with HincII at nucleotide 2204 and HpaII at nucleotide 2560, respectively. The resulting cDNA fragment was inserted into the pGEX-3X vector. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into the XL-I Blue E. coli strain. Methods for recombinant protein expression were the same as described above. GST-phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase was prepared as an HindIII restriction fragment containing the amino terminus to residue 388 (Shibasaki et al., 1994Shibasaki F. Fukami K. Fukui Y. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Experiments on Ash Isoforms with Proteins in Cell LysatesRat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/15-cm dish/10 ml) by incubating in methionine-free medium for 3 h. Subsequently, the cells were, if necessary, exposed to 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 3 min. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in LIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 100 μM leupeptin, 100 μM aprotinin, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM EGTA), lysed by sonication, and finally centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The cell lysates thus obtained were mixed with 50 μm of glutathione beads binding GST-fusion proteins (50 μg of protein) and incubated at overnight 4°C. The beads were washed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1.0% Triton X-100, and suspended in SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE was carried out, autoradiograms were obtained using Kodak X-Omat film exposed for 2 days. The protein bands of dynamin and Sos were determined by Western blot using anti-dynamin antibody (Miki et al., 1994Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-mouse Sos 1 antibody (UBI, New York), respectively.GST-Ash Fusion Protein Injection into Balb/c 3T3 CellsGST-Ash-l, GST-Ash-m, and GST-Ash-s eluted from the glutathione-agarose column were dialyzed against 140 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.25). Protein concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/ml.Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Two days after plating, the cells were deprived of serum in medium containing insulin (5 μg/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and then incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Fusion proteins (1 mg/ml) or GST (1 mg/ml) were microinjected into the cytoplasm of cells using an Eppendorf microinjector and micromanipulator. One hour after injection, the cells were exposed to 5 units/ml PDGF and cultured in the presence of 50 μM 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 20 h. After labeling, the dishes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid/H2O (90:5:5) for 20 min at room temperature. The proportion of cells synthesizing DNA was determined using a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Life Science).RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of cDNA Clones from Ash/Grb2-splicing Isoforms and Transcribed PseudogeneInitial screening of the 2 × 106 recombinant phages with 32P-labeled Ash/Grb2(Ash-l) cDNA as a probe yielded 57 positive clones. Ten recombinant phage DNAs which hybridized to the probe were purified. Among these cDNA clones, three did not hybridize to the oligonucleotide derived from the 3′-coding region of the Ash-l nucleotide sequence (oligo-4 in Fig. 1a). Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that two clones were identical with each other except for a difference in size and shared 93% identity in nucleotide sequence with Ash-l cDNA (Fig. 1a). However, the clones do not have long open reading frames because of the frequent appearance of stop codons. We concluded, therefore, that these cDNAs, designated Ash-ψ, were derived from unusual transcribed genes. The third clone, Ash-s cDNA, had a nucleotide sequence identical with Ash-l cDNA in the first SH3 domain (Fig. 1, a and b). However, the coding sequence was terminated at the end of the SH3 domain by a stop codon, after which the sequence differed from that of Ash-l cDNA. Accordingly, the Ash-s isoform is solely comprised of a single SH3 domain identical with that of Ash-l. In order to search for other isoform types, we purified 47 additional phage DNAs which had given positive signals in the first library screening. Then we performed polymerase chain reaction experiments on the DNAs using the oligonucleotide primers (oligo-2 and −5) described under “Materials and Methods,” this gave 506-bp fragments for Ash-l cDNA. We detected three clones generating about 450-bp fragments. Since these clones were identical with one another, we designated them as Ash-m cDNA. The coding sequence of Ash-m cDNA is 42 nucleotides shorter than that of Ash-l cDNA. The defective region of Ash-m corresponds to 14 amino acid residues between 157 and 170 of Ash-l, which comprise the amino-terminal region of the second SH3 domain (Fig. 1b). According to the length of the cDNAs, Ash/Grb2 and two isoforms are named Ash-l, Ash-m, and Ash-s.Cloning and Organization of the Ash-l-encoding Gene and Generation of Ash IsoformsIn order to confirm that the three isoforms, including Ash-l, arise from a single gene by alternative splicing, we isolated genomic clones of the rat Ash-l-encoding gene and analyzed gene organization by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing together with genomic Southern blot analysis. Screening of a rat genomic DNA library yielded 37 genomic clones hybridizing to the Ash cDNA probe. These clones were classified into three types by digesting the recombinant phage DNAs with restriction enzymes. One of these, γG-Ash-ψ corresponded to genomic DNA encoding Ash-ψ.2( 2K. Watanabe, T. Fukuchi, H. Hosoya, T. Shirasawa, K. Matuoka, H. Miki, and T. Takenawa, unpublished data.) The other two, λG-Ash1 and λG-Ash2, encoded Ash/Grb2(Ash-l). The amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions were encoded in λG-Ash1 and λG-Ash2, respectively. Although λG-Ash1 and λG-Ash2 do not overlap, the nucleotide sequences of the exons in these two clones account for the entire sequence of Ash-l cDNA. Ash-l gene has a length of more than 16 kilobases and consists of six exons and five introns (Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequences at the exon-intron boundaries show that all introns start with GT at the 5′ end and terminate with AG at the 3′ end (Table I). This conforms to the “GT-AG rule” (Breathnach and Chambon, 1981Breathnach R. Chambon P. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar). The genomic cloning of the gene revealed that the two isoforms, Ash-s and -m, are generated from a single gene by unusual alternative splicings. Ash-s mRNAs are comprised of the first two exons and a part of the second intron of the gene. A splicing donor site for the third exon was not recognized in Ash-s transcripts. Thus, a poly(A) sequence is attached in the transcribed region of the intron. Since a stop codon appears in-frame at the exon-intron boundary of the gene, a part of the third intron is recognized as a 3′-flanking sequence in Ash-s mRNAs. Thus Ash-s consists solely of the first SH3 domain of Ash-l. On the other hand, splicing for Ash-m mRNAs occurred at the sequence 5′-GACTTTGACCCCCAGG-3′, which is located within the sixth exon, instead of at 5′-CTCTTCTCTCTTGCAGC-3′ as for Ash-l mRNAs (Fig. 2 and Table I). The first 42 nucleotide residues of the sixth exon of Ash-l are recognized as a part of the fifth intron in Ash-m. Thus, the sixth exon of Ash-m starts inside the Ash-l exon, and 14 amino acid residues encoding the amino-terminal of the second SH3 domain are defective in Ash-m.Figure 2:Restriction map and organization of the Ash isoform-encoding gene. Exons and introns are shown below. Closed and open boxes indicate coding and noncoding exons, respectively.

Each lane yielded pairs of bands except for the lane of BamHI digestion, in which two fragments were likely to be in the identical mobility. The restriction fragments generated from λG-Ash2 and λG-Ash-ψ accounted for these bands. Accordingly, we concluded that Ash-l and Ash-m were transcribed from a single gene.Figure 3:Comparison of restriction fragments hybridizing with Ash cDNA probe in genomic DNA with those in cloned DNAs.

The ratio between Ash-m and Ash-l mRNAs varied among tissues (Fig. 4a). Higher contents of Ash-m mRNA than that of Ash-l were observed in lung, stomach, and skeletal muscle. By contrast, Ash-m mRNAs were barely detectable in cerebrum, spleen, kidney, and testis. On the other hand, Ash-s mRNAs were detected abundantly in spleen and kidney but rarely expressed in stomach and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4b).Figure 4:Tissue distribution of Ash-l, Ash-m, and Ash-s. a, reverse-transcribed PCR products for Ash-l and Ash-m from various tissues were observed with ethidium bromide. Lanes: 1, cerebrum; 2, thymus; 3, spleen; 4, heart; 5, lung; 6, liver; 7, kidney; 8, stomach; 9, small intestine; 10, large intestine; 11, skeletal muscle; 12, testis. b, reverse-transcribed PCR products for Ash-s from various tissues were analyzed with Southern blot hybridization as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding Proteins to Ash-m and -s ProteinsTo compare the binding ability of Ash isoforms, the concentrations of GST-fusion proteins were adjusted and binding assays were carried out. In vitro binding experiments using the GST-fusion proteins of Ash isoforms demonstrated that Ash-m does not associate effectively with proteins such as dynamin and Sos in PC12 cell lysates compared to Ash-l (Fig. 5a). The bands of dynamin and Sos were identified by anti-dynamin and anti-Sos antibodies. Especially, the binding ability of Ash-m to Sos was very low. On the other hand, Ash-s formed a significant complex with dynamin and Sos in PC12 cell lysates, although binding to other proteins including 55-kDa, 130-kDa, and 180-kDa proteins appeared not so marked as that of Ash-l. These results were unaffected by treating the cells with nerve growth factor. Ash-s is composed exclusively of a single SH3 domain. Hence, the binding ability of Ash-s to Sos and dynamin was compared with that of SH3 domains from phospholipase C γ-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-kinase). As shown in Fig. 5b, the SH3 domains from phospholipase C and PI-3-kinase bound less effectively to SOS or dynamin in cell lysates than to Ash-s, while the Ash-s SH3 domain associated with both molecules. The binding of Ash-s to dynamin in PC12 cell lysates was more marked than that to Sos. In contrast, Ash-s bound to Sos more than to dynamin in Balb/c 3T3 cell lysates (Fig. 5b). These results suggest that signaling molecules bound to Ash-s differ among cells, although it only reflects the existing amounts of proteins.Figure 5:Binding specificity of Ash isoforms to the proteins in cell lysates. a, binding of Ash isoforms to Sos and dynamin in PC12 cell lysates.

The SH3 domains from Ash-s, phospholipase C, and PI-3-kinase were prepared as GST-fusion proteins in E. coli.

Therefore, the new SH3 may bind different proteins from those bound to carboxyl-terminal SH3 of Ash-l. To examine the possibility, we compared the proteins bound to carboxyl-terminal SH3 of Ash-m to those bound to amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal SH3 domains of Ash-l using bovine brain. As shown in Fig. 6a, carboxyl-terminal SH3 of Ash-m did not bind Sos or dynamin. However, it was found to be able to bind several new proteins (60-kDa and 170-kDa proteins shown by arrows). Since Ash-m was found to be abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, we also examined proteins bound to carboxyl-terminal Ash-m SH3 using chicken skeletal muscle. The protein binding pattern to carboxyl-terminal Ash-m SH3 was different from that of Ash-l (Fig. 6b). Proteins (90-kDa and 170-kDa proteins shown by arrows) were specifically bound to carboxyl-terminal Ash-m SH3. These data suggest that Ash-m generates new signals different from those of Ash-l.Figure 6:Different proteins bind to carboxyl-terminal SH3 domains of As"
https://openalex.org/W2101691594,"Abstract Sequence-specific transcriptional activators, such as the human factor E2F-1, increase the rate of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, possibly by contacting one or more of the RNA polymerase II-associated general initiation factors. One candidate target of transactivators is the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which, when bound to a promoter, nucleates the formation of a preinitiation complex. Previous studies using affinity chromatography techniques have shown that the activation domains of certain activators, including the acidic activation domain of E2F-1, can interact with TBP in the absence of DNA. Using a site-directed photoaffinity cross-linking approach, we demonstrate here that the activation domain of the chimeric activator LexA-E2F-1 can be cross-linked to TBP when both factors are bound to a transcriptionally responsive RNA polymerase II promoter. Mutations within the activation domain of LexA-E2F-1 that impaired its ability to activate transcription in vitro were found to reduce cross-linking of LexA-E2F-1 to TBP. The association of initiation factor TFIIB with the TBP-promoter complex did not preclude this promoter-dependent cross-linking of LexA-E2F-1 to TBP. TFIIB itself could also be cross-linked to LexA-E2F-1; however, this cross-linking was promoter-independent. In contrast, TFIIA strongly inhibited the promoter-dependent cross-linking of LexA-E2F-1 to TBP. These results directly demonstrate that acidic activators such as E2F-1 can interact with TBP during the earliest stages in the assembly of an RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091760309,"Previous studies with synthetic peptides indicate that residues 290-309, corresponding to the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II interact with the catalytic core of the enzyme as a pseudosubstrate (Colbran, R. J., Smith, M. K., Schworer, C. M., Fong, Y. L., and Soderling, T. R.(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4800-4804). In the present study, we attempted to locate the pseudosubstrate motif by generation or removal of potential substrate recognition sequences (RXXS/T) at selected positions using site-directed mutagenesis. Based on previous results, Arg297, Thr305/306, and Ser314 were selected as key residues. Single mutations such as N294S, K300S, A302R, A309R, and R311A were expressed, purified, and characterized. Several of the mutants exhibited decreased binding of and activation by CaM, not surprising since the mutations were within the CaM-binding domain. None of the mutants exhibited enhanced Ca2+-independent kinase activity toward exogenous substrate, but the K300S and N294S mutants showed a significant enhancement in the rate and stoichiometry of 32P incorporation during Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation. Using two-dimensional peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analyses, enhanced phosphorylation of the introduced Ser residue was demonstrated in the K300S mutant but not in the N294S mutant. This specific Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation of Ser300 is consistent with the hypothesis that Arg297 may occupy the P(−3) position in a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory interaction with the catalytic core in the nonactivated state of the kinase. Previous studies with synthetic peptides indicate that residues 290-309, corresponding to the calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II interact with the catalytic core of the enzyme as a pseudosubstrate (Colbran, R.

Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II)1( 1The abbreviations used are: CaM kinase IICa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase known to be involved in a variety of cellular functions (reviewed in Refs. 1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar and 2Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1990; 31: 181-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The enzyme is present in most tissues but is particularly abundant in brain. The adult rat brain kinase is an oligomeric enzyme composed of 10-12 subunits (50-60 kDa each) of several isoforms in varying molar ratios. All isoforms share at their NH2 termini a highly conserved catalytic domain characteristic of serine/threonine kinases in general. The central portion of each subunit contains the regulatory domain comprised of an autoinhibitory sequence overlapping a CaM-binding region, and the COOH terminus contains an association domain, which is important in holoenzyme formation. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Like many other protein kinases, CaM kinase II is regulated by an autoinhibitory mechanism. In the absence of Ca2+/CaM, low basal kinase activity is due to interaction of amino acid residues within the regulatory domain with the catalytic region, thereby blocking access of exogenous protein substrates and ATP. Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the CaM-binding motif (residues 293-310 in the α subunit) removes the regulatory domain from the catalytic domain, which converts the kinase to its fully active form. Several recent studies (3Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have addressed the mechanisms of autoinhibition and regulation of CaM kinase II. For example, studies with synthetic peptides corresponding to the regulatory domain of α CaM kinase II suggest that residues between 281 and 289 interact with the ATP-binding motif, whereas residues between 290 and 309 interact with the protein/peptide-binding elements of the catalytic domain (3Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a bisubstrate-directed autoinhibitory mechanism was indicated, and we have recently proposed a molecular model for α CaM kinase II, illustrating a possible interaction of the bisubstrate autoinhibitory domain with the bilobal catalytic domain of the enzyme (4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For several protein kinases, the autoinhibitory mechanism has been suggested to be due to interaction of a pseudosubstrate sequence in the regulatory domain with the active site of the enzyme (5Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1823-1826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bagchi I.C. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 621-626PubMed Google Scholar, 7Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A pseudosubstrate type of inhibition has also been proposed for CaM kinase II (3Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in our molecular model of CaM kinase II (4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arg297 was proposed to occupy the P(−3) position of a putative pseudosubstrate sequence. In the present study, we have investigated the pseudosubstrate mechanism by generating or removing substrate consensus sequences (RXXS/T) at several potential sites in α CaM kinase II through site-specific mutagenesis. Since most of the mutations were introduced into the CaM-binding region of the regulatory domain, this study also revealed some important information about the structural basis of regulation by CaM in the context of the holoenzyme structure of CaM kinase II. The cDNA encoding the 50-kDa mouse brain CaM kinase II α subunit was inserted into the EcoRI site of pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector and digested with XbaI and PstI. A 680-base pair SphI-PstI fragment from the 3′-end of the mouse CaM kinase II cDNA (corresponding to the regulatory and subunit association domains of the kinase) was inserted into M13 mp19 to generate single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis. The following oligonucleotides were designed for carrying out the mutations mentioned (mutated bases underlined): N294S, 5′-TTCCTCCTGGCACTGAACTTCTTCAG-3′; K300S, 5′-GAGGATGGCTCCACTCAGTTTCCTCCT-3′; A302R, 5′-TGGTGAGGATTCTTCCCTTCAGTTTCC-3′; A309R, 5′-GAGAAGTTCCTGGTTCTCAGCATAGTGGT-3′; R311A, 5′-TCCGGAGAAGTTCGCGGTGGCCAGCATAGT-3′. Mutagenesis was carried out by using Sculptor™ in vitro mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.). The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire 650-base pair fragment using the Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. After mutation, the SphI-PstI fragments were ligated to XbaI-SphI-digested 5′-fragment (corresponding to catalytic region) of mouse CaM kinase-II α, and the total cDNA molecule corresponding to the 50-kDa subunit was inserted into XbaI- and PstI-digested pVL1393 for subsequent expression in baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. The wild-type and mutant CaM kinase II enzymes were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system as previously described (10Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Recombinant viruses were isolated via homologous recombination and plaque purification. Isolated recombinant viruses were titered by plaque assay method (11O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, NY1992: 130-132Google Scholar). About 150 ml of Sf9 cell culture at log phase (1.2-1.6 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 3 in Corning spinner flasks. Infected cells were harvested between 48-72 h, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70°C until purification. The wild-type and mutant CaM kinase II enzymes were purified by CaM-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described before (10Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because of the poor affinity for CaM, mutants K300S and A302R were eluted in the salt wash step. All the enzyme preparations were dialyzed against 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C. CaM kinase II activities were measured routinely at 30°C for 1 min using standard assay conditions containing 40 μM syntide-2, 0.5 mM [γ-32P]ATP (600-2000 cpm/pmol), and either 0.5 mM Ca2+, 3 μM CaM (total activity) or 1 mM EGTA (Ca2+-independent activity) in a final volume of 25 μl (10Brickey D.A. Colbran R.J. Fong Y.-L. Soderling T.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). All assays were initiated by the addition of kinases diluted appropriately in dilution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% ethylene glycol). 32P incorporation was determined by spotting 15-μl aliquots onto Whatman P-81 phosphocellulose paper followed by washing in 75 mM phosphoric acid as described (12Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Blocking, washing, and antibody dilution were done with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20. The stock solution of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (3 mg/ml methanol) was diluted 6-fold in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl. Goat polyclonal anti-rat brain CaM kinase II was diluted 500-fold. Anti-CaM kinase II was prepared by Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and was purified by affinity chromatography using CaM kinase II linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). The peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-goat IgG antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was diluted 1000-fold. Wild-type and mutant CaM kinase II enzymes were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl2 0.2% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Biotinylated CaM was added at a final concentration of 0.4 μg/ml in the above buffer without milk and incubated for 1 h. After washing with buffer alone, the membranes were incubated with 1:500-diluted avidin D-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The membranes were washed extensively with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 and developed with 4-chloro-1-naphthol and H2O2. Mapping of the phosphorylation sites was performed as previously described (13Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but with some modifications. The 32P-labeled proteins or peptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes after separation by 10% SDS-PAGE and 18% Tricine gel. Subsequent digestions with CNBr or trypsin were carried out on the corresponding membrane fragments containing the labeled protein or peptides as described earlier (13Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the 32P-labeled tryptic peptides for two-dimensional peptide mapping were dried by speed vac, resuspended in 100 μl of 6 N HCl at 110°C for 1 h. Hydrolyzed samples were dried and resuspended in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer (formic acid:glacial acetic acid:water, 25:78:897, v/v/v). The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were separated by one-dimension electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer for 1 h at 1.5 kV and detected by autoradiography. For phosphoamino acid analysis of peptides from two-dimensional maps, the corresponding spot was scraped off the cellulose plate and washed with pH 1.9 buffer to elute the phosphopeptide (14Boyle W.J. Geer P.V. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled phosphopeptide was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described above. CaM was purified from bovine brain according to the method of Gopalakrishna and Anderson (15Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Syntide-2 was synthesized and purified as previously described (16Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein binding assay using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as standard. Previous studies with synthetic peptides showed that residues 290-309 in the autoinhibitory domain of CaM kinase II inhibited a catalytic fragment of CaM kinase II competitively with substrate. This result suggests that residues 290-309 interact as a pseudosubstrate with the catalytic core of the enzyme in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (3Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to locate the pseudosubstrate sequence by generating or removing potential substrate consensus sequences (RXXS/T) through site-specific mutagenesis of selected residues as shown below. Sequence 1 Arg297, Thr305/306, and Ser314, indicated by the asterisks, were selected as key residues for analyses. On the basis of substitution studies in synthetic peptides (9Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Arg297 was suggested to be an important determinant for interaction of the autoinhibitory domain peptide of CaM kinase II with the protein-binding motif of the catalytic core, and it has been modeled by our laboratory to occupy the P(−3) position of a pseudosubstrate (4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thr305/306 and Ser314 have been shown to be the major autophosphorylation sites in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (17Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hanson P.I. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17216-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We made single mutants by introducing Ser residues in place of Asn294 and Lys300, which are at the P-0 positions on the NH2- and COOH-terminal sides, respectively, of Arg297 because the relative orientation of the autoinhibitory region with respect to the active site of the enzyme is not established yet. Two other single mutants were made by introducing an Arg in place of Ala302 or Ala309, which would place them three residues to the NH2- and COOH-terminal sides of Thr305/306, respectively. It is known that CaM kinase II recognizes phosphorylation sites that have an Arg three residues NH2-terminal of the phosphorylated Ser or Thr. Since the orientation of the autoinhibitory polypeptide sequence in the catalytic site (see model in Ref. 4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may be opposite to that of the normal substrate, we wanted to also place an Arg three residues COOH-terminal of Thr306 (i.e. mutant A309R). The R311A mutant was constructed to test the effect of disruption of the substrate recognition sequence around Ser314. The mutants were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system and purified on CaM-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All the mutants were at least 90% pure and gave a major 50-kDa band on SDS-PAGE by Coomassie stain (Fig. 1A) and by Western analyses (Fig. 1B). Four of our mutations are in the CaM-binding region of the autoinhibitory domain, and these mutants showed lower affinity for CaM. Fig. 1C shows the CaM overlay assay for all the mutants. The relative CaM binding affinities were wild type = R311A > N294S > A309R > K300S > A302R. The abilities of the mutants to be activated by CaM are shown in Fig. 2. Mutants N294S and R311A exhibited similar CaM activation profiles as the wild-type enzyme with A values of 0.1-0.15 μM in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2. The A309R and K300S mutants showed significant loss in CaM activation with A values of 0.6 and 1.6 μM, respectively. The A302R mutant showed a severe loss in CaM activation, and the A value could not be determined for this mutant.Figure 2:Ca2+/CaM activation of wild-type and mutant CaM kinase II. Kinase assays were performed in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+ and the indicated concentrations of CaM. Equivalent amounts (15 nM) of wild-type enzyme (□), N294S (◊), K300S (○), A302R (∆), A309R (⊞), and R311A (♦) mutants were used. Maximal activation (100%) was the activity at 12 μM CaM (see Table I), where activation had reached a plateau for all the mutants except A302R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of the mutants had activities in the absence of Ca2+/CaM similar to wild-type kinase (Table I), and this indicates that the mutations, which are not in the catalytic domain, had no significant effect on the basic catalytic properties of the kinase. When assayed in the presence of saturating CaM (12 μM), most of the mutants had specific activities (Table I) between 14-22 μmol/min/mg, comparable to the wild-type enzyme. Mutant K300S displayed a 10-fold lower specific activity, probably a consequence of its altered interaction with CaM. It is known that mutations within CaM can not only affect the apparent K for activation of its target proteins but also the extent of activation at saturating CaM (19Gao Z.H. Krebs J. VanBerkum M.F.A. Tang W.J. Maune J.F. Means A.R. Stull J.T. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20096-20104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not surprising that mutation within the CaM-binding domain of a target protein may have a similar effect.Table ISpecific activities of the wild-type and mutant kinases Truncation of CaM kinase II at residue 316 produces a monomeric species of CaM kinase II that requires Ca2+/CaM for activation (20Mukherji S. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20733-20738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that interaction of the autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic domain is intrasubunit in the holoenzyme. Furthermore, CaM kinase II undergoes slow, intrasubunit autophosphorylation at 23°C in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (i.e. 1 mM EGTA) (13Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that this Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation occurs predominantly at Thr306 in the CaM-binding domain, and this blocks subsequent binding of CaM and prevents activation of the enzyme (17Colbran R.J.

Therefore, if any of our autoinhibitory domain mutations converted a pseudosubstrate motif into a substrate site, we would expect enhanced intrasubunit, Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation of that mutant. When we subjected the mutant kinases to Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation conditions, the K300S and N294S mutants showed enhanced rates of 32P incorporation compared with wild-type kinase and the other mutants (Fig. 3). The stoichiometry of 32P incorporation per mole of enzyme subunit was also increased. For the K300S mutant, about 0.4 mol of 32P was incorporated per mol of enzyme subunit in 15 min at room temperature compared with about 0.1 mol for wild-type kinase (Fig. 3). The N294S mutant incorporated 0.2 mol of 32P under identical conditions. The A302R, A309R, and R311A mutants did not show any significant differences in either rate or stoichiometry of 32P incorporation compared with wild-type enzyme, and all showed a similar loss (50-70%) in Ca2+/CaM-stimulated activity after 15 min of incubation in the presence of 1 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM ATP at room temperature (data not shown). This loss of activation by Ca2+/CaM is consistent with the known Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation of Thr306. Since the K300S and N294S mutants demonstrated enhanced Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation, we carefully examined the effects of this autophosphorylation on their kinase activities. The K300S mutant did exhibit a slightly higher rate of inactivation, whereas the N294S mutant showed a rate of inactivation similar to the wild-type kinase (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Inactivation of N294S and K300S mutants due to Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation. Wild-type CaM kinase II, N294S, and K300S mutant enzymes were autophosphorylated in the absence of Ca2+/CaM as described in Fig. 3. At the indicated times, aliquots were removed, and autophosphorylation reactions were stopped by adding EDTA. An aliquot from these solutions was diluted 35-150-fold in dilution buffer, and total kinase activities (i.e. + Ca2+/CaM) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Assays were done in duplicate, and the experiment is representative of three similar experiments. Kinase activities of the wild-type (□), N294S (◊), and K300S (○) mutant enzymes are expressed as a percentage of corresponding controls incubated under identical conditions except for the absence of ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When autophosphorylation was performed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, all of the mutants, except A302R, generated similar Ca2+-independent activity indicative of autophosphorylation of Thr286 (data not shown except for K300S mutant in Table II). Also, enhanced 32P incorporation was observed for autophosphorylation of the K300S mutant only in the absence (Fig. 3) and not in the presence of Ca2+/CaM (Table II).Table IIEffect of Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation on K300S mutant Finally, we analyzed the phosphorylation sites for the K300S and N294S mutants by two-dimensional 32P peptide mapping. To simplify the analysis, we restricted our analysis to the 3-kDa CNBr fragment, which contains the autophosphorylation sites of interest (13Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The patterns of the CNBr/tryptic phosphopeptide maps were the same for wild-type enzyme, N294S and K300S mutants, showing only one major radioactive 32P peptide with comparable mobility (Fig. 5). Since Ser300 and Thr306 are present in the same CNBr/tryptic phosphopeptide (LS∗GAILTT∗M), only one spot was expected to be generated due to phosphorylation of either Ser300 or Thr306. The absence of any additional spots in the phosphopeptide map of the N294S mutant indicated that Ser294 was not phosphorylated. We also carried out phosphoamino acid analyses on the 3-kDa CNBr/tryptic peptide fragment from the wild-type enzyme, N294S and K300S mutants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For wild-type enzyme and N294S mutant, only Thr residues were phosphorylated (Fig. 6A, lanes1 and 2). However, the K300S mutant gave phosphorylation of both Thr and Ser (Fig. 6A, lane3). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphopeptide 1 (Fig. 5D) also showed the presence of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (Fig. 6B) in the same spot, thereby confirming the phosphorylation of Ser300 in the K300S mutant.Figure 6:Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled tryptic fragments from N294S and K300S mutants. A, aliquots of the 32P-labeled CNBr/tryptic peptides prepared for two-dimensional peptide maps as described in Fig. 5 were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl, and the released 32P amino acids were separated by thin layer electrophoresis at pH 1.9 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lane1 represents wild-type enzyme; lane2, N294S mutant; lane3, K300S mutant, B, peptide 1 from panelD of Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CaM binding motifs of several Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes act as autoinhibitory domains of their respective enzyme functions (21James P.

Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In some cases, autoinhibitory domains have been proposed to interact with the catalytic core of the enzyme as a pseudosubstrate (6Bagchi I.C. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 621-626PubMed Google Scholar, 7Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In CaM kinase II, residues 281-290 interact with the ATP-binding pocket of the catalytic domain, whereas residues 290-309, which also comprise the CaM-binding domain, have been proposed on the basis of synthetic peptide and mutagenesis studies (3Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M. Fong Y.L. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4800-4804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to act as a pseudosubstrate by blocking the protein-substrate motif. The present study was aimed at exploring the pseudosubstrate sequence in the autoinhibitory domain by generating or removing possible substrate consensus sequences around three potential sites: Arg297, Thr305/306, or Ser314. The unaltered Ca2+-independent specific activities of the mutants (Table I) indicated there were no major changes in basic catalytic properties of the enzymes due to mutations. This conclusion was supported by the examination of other catalytic properties of the enzymes, such as autophosphorylation properties. After activation by Ca2+/CaM in the presence of Mg2+/ATP, CaM kinase II autophosphorylates itself on Thr286 in the autoinhibitory domain in an intersubunit manner (13Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13744-13747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hanson P.I. Meyer T. Stryer L. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 943-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and the enzyme becomes partially Ca2+/CaM independent. All the mutant enzymes, except A302R, exhibited normal Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation and generation of Ca2+-independent activity similar to the wild-type enzyme. Because the specific activity of the A302R mutant in the presence of Ca2+/CaM was so low, this mutant could not be tested for any Ca2+/CaM-dependent phenomena. Changing a pseudosubstrate autoinhibitory sequence to a substrate consensus sequence would be expected to enhance intrasubunit autophosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. The A302R, A309R, and R311A mutants exhibited the same rates and stoichiometries of 32P incorporation during Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation as the wild-type enzyme, thereby excluding Thr305/306 and Ser314 as possible pseudosubstrate sites. This is consistent with previous data indicating that the autoinhibitory domain resides within residues 281-302 (9Smith M.K. Colbran R.J. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, both the K300S and the N294S mutants exhibited enhanced rates and stoichiometries of Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation (Fig. 3). When we measured the corresponding rates of inactivation for these two mutants due to Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation, only the K300S mutant showed a higher rate of inactivation compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). As discussed below, Lys300 of the CaM kinase II peptide interacts with glutamate residues in the NH2-terminal lobe of Ca2+/CaM (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and the K300S mutation in CaM kinase II reduced CaM binding (Fig. 1C). It is likely that introduction of negative charge by phosphorylation of Ser300 in the K300S mutant would further disrupt the interaction with CaM, causing an enhanced rate of inactivation during Ca2+-independent autophosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser300, but not Ser294, was demonstrated by two-dimensional peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 5 and 6). The enhanced autophosphorylation observed with the N294S mutant was due to phosphophorylation of an unknown site. Multiple sites are subject to autophosphorylation in the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM (1Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1990; 31: 181-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and we did not attempt to identify this site in the N294S mutant since its autophosphorylation did not produce any detectable changes in the kinase. The mutations that we studied were also within the CaM-binding domain, and many of the mutants (Fig. 1C, Fig. 2, and) were altered in their abilities to bind to and be activated by Ca2+/CaM. This is to be expected since the crystal structure of Ca2+/CaM bound to peptide 290-314 of CaM kinase II (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) has shown that residues 293-310 form electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with CaM. The cluster of three basic residues (Arg296-Arg297-Lys298) and Lys300 in the NH2-terminal half of CaM kinase II peptide form salt bridges with glutamate residues on both the NH2- and COOH-terminal lobes of CaM. Hydrophobic residues Leu299 and Ile303 on the NH2-terminal half and Leu308 on the COOH-terminal half of the peptide are involved in hydrophobic interactions with the COOH- and NH2-terminal lobes, respectively, of CaM. We found that insertion of charge at position 302 (A302R mutant), which should disrupt the hydrophobic interaction with the COOH-terminal lobe of CaM, caused the most severe loss in binding (Fig. 1C) and activation by CaM (Fig. 2, Table I). The hydrophobic interaction with the NH2-terminal lobe of CaM, on the other hand, appeared to be more involved in CaM binding (Fig. 1C) than in kinase activation (Fig. 2,), as observed with the A309R mutant. Similar but less pronounced effects were observed with the N294S mutant, probably because the charge was not altered. The K300S mutant showed a strong effect on binding to and activation by CaM, presumably by disrupting the electrostatic interaction of Lys300 with glutamate residues in the NH2-terminal lobe of CaM. Although 12 μM CaM was not able to fully activate the K300S mutant (Table I), autophosphorylation on Thr286, which normally does not increase total kinase activity assayed in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, caused a 4-fold increase in total kinase activity of the K300S mutant (Table II). This result is consistent with impaired binding to and activation by CaM for this mutant. Thus, our mutagenesis results suggest that although both lobes of CaM are involved in binding to CaM kinase II through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, the COOH-terminal lobe of CaM probably plays the major role in the binding and activation mechanism. Although several of the mutants in this study had altered CaM binding properties, none of the mutants demonstrated enhanced Ca2+-independent activity toward exogenous substrate (i.e. syntide 2) in the absence of Ca2+/CaM compared with wild-type kinase (Table I). This indicates that none of the mutations weakened the interaction of the autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic domain. Similar findings were obtained with another Ca2+/CaM-regulated enzyme, myosin light chain kinase (25Bagchi I.R. Huang Q. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3024-3029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11838-11841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation to acidic residues of the basic residues RRK on the NH2-terminal side of the CaM-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase altered the CaM binding affinity but did not give rise to Ca2+-independent activity (26Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11838-11841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that the mechanisms of CaM activation and mechanism of autoinhibition involve different residues. This is contrary to a “flip-flop model” proposed earlier (27Jarret H.W. Madhavan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 362-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which assumed an autoinhibitory mechanism in which the CaM-binding domain interacted with a “CaM-like binding region” on the enzyme surface. In summary, the observation that Ser300 is autophosphorylated in the absence of Ca2+/CaM is consistent with our previous synthetic peptide study (4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our molecular model (4Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that Arg297 may occupy the P(−3) position of a pseudosubstrate inhibitor. Our results also support some of the conclusions made from the crystal structure of CaM with the synthetic CaM-binding peptide complex (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In addition, this study shows in the context of the entire enzyme structure which residues are obligatory for high affinity CaM binding versus those that may be necessary for conformational changes and those that participate directly in modulation of enzyme activity."

In an attempt to identify plasma membrane glycoconjugates which mediate cell migration, migrating and nonmigrating rabbit corneal epithelia were analyzed for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for unsubstituted N-acetyllactosamine (mAb 1B2), Lex (mAbs 7A and MMA), and sialyl Lex (mAb CSLEX1) carbohydrate chains of neolactoglycoconjugates. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that regardless of whether the epithelia analyzed were from corneas of animals in vivo, corneas in organ culture, or cells in tissue culture, migrating cells stained intensely with mAb 1B2, whereas nonmigrating cells either did not stain or stained only weakly. mAbs MMA and 7A stained migrating epithelium as well as basal and middle cell layers of normal, nonmigrating epithelium. mAb CSLEX1 did not stain wounded corneas but stained the superficial cell layer of normal corneal epithelium. Biochemical analyses by TLC immunostaining revealed the presence of three mAb 1B2-reactive glycosphingolipids (GSL), neolactotetraosyl-(nLc4, paragloboside), neolactohexaosyl- (nLc6), and neolacto-octaosylceramide (nLc8) in migrating epithelia. In contrast, nonmigrating epithelia contained only trace amounts of these glycolipids. Exogenous addition of nLc4, but not various other GSLs including a Lex-GSL (SSEA-1), stimulated re-epithelialization of wounds in an experimental model of corneal epithelial wound healing. Moreover, re-epithelialization of wounds was significantly inhibited by mAb 1B2 but not by mAb MMA.

INTRODUCTIONThe presence of fully functioning intact epithelium on the surface of the cornea is essential for the proper functioning and transparency of this tissue. Re-epithelialization following injury and various surgical procedures takes place by the migration of adjacent cells over the injured area (1Hanna C. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1966; 61: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 2Pfister R.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1975; 14: 648-661Google Scholar). Delayed re-epithelialization and failure of the migrated epithelium to remain adherent to the substratum are fundamental causes of debilitating clinical conditions such as persistent or recurring epithelial defects and corneal ulceration (3Cavanagh H.D. Pihlaja D. Thoft R.A. Dohlman C.H. Am. Acad. Ophthalmol. Otol. 1976; 81: 754-769Google Scholar, 4Cavanagh H.D. Colley A. Pihlaja D.J. Int. Ophthalmol. Clin. 1979; 19: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the molecular events which mediate migration of epithelium over a wound and adhesion of epithelium to the underlying substratum have not been well defined, it is generally accepted that plasma membrane glycoconjugates of corneal epithelium are involved in these events (5Gipson I.K.

Various lectins have been shown to either inhibit attachment of corneal epithelial cells to denuded basal lamina or inhibit the cellular spreading of the attached cells on the basal lamina (10Trinkaus-Randall V. Newton A.W. Gipson I.K. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that while some lectins such as Ricinus communis agglutinin I inhibit wound closure (5Gipson I.K. Anderson R.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1980; 19: 341-349PubMed Google Scholar), fucose-specific lectins such as Ulex europaeus agglutinin I and Lotus tetragonolobus stimulate re-epithelialization of rabbit corneal wounds in organ culture (46Jorna A. Raizman M. Panjwani N. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1553Google Scholar).A number of studies conducted using mouse embryo cells, brain cells and lymphocytes have provided evidence that cell surface glycoconjugates containing neolacto-series carbohydrate chains are involved in intercellular adhesion as well as cell-matrix interactions (11Solter D.

In the present study, based on findings that: (i) the levels of polylactosamine GSLs, nLc4, nLc6, and nLc8 (nLcs), are markedly elevated during corneal epithelial cell migration, (ii) exogenous addition of nLc4 stimulates corneal epithelial cell migration, and (iii) a mAb specific for nLcs inhibits corneal epithelial cell migration, we suggest that polylactosamine GSLs of corneal epithelium are among the molecules which mediate corneal epithelial cell migration following injury.

Proparacaine eye drops were applied to the cornea as a topical anesthetic, one eye of each animal was proptosed, and the central cornea was outlined with an 8-mm surgical trephine. The epithelium within the demarcated area was removed with a Beaver blade, and the corneas were allowed to heal in vivo for 2 to 3 days. Re-epithelialization was monitored daily by staining with fluorescein. Wound size progressively reduced with time (Fig. 1). The contralateral eye, treated with the topical anesthetic, but unscraped, served as a control. For immunohistochemical studies, the animals were sacrificed 24 h after wounding, and the corneas were processed by preparing 6-μm thick cryosections for staining with anti-GSL monoclonal antibodies. All animal treatments in this study conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the Use of Animals in Vision Research and the recommendations of the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.To analyze migrating and nonmigrating corneal epithelia in organ culture, we used rabbit eyes from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AK). The eyes from 8- to 12-week-old New Zealand rabbits reached our laboratory on wet ice within 24 h after slaughter. Prior to use, all eyes were examined for epithelial integrity by fluorescein staining, and approximately 30% of the eyes lacking an intact corneal epithelium were discarded. For the preparation of migrating epithelia, the eyes were washed in sterile saline, the central corneas were demarcated by an 8-mm trephine, and the epithelium within the trephined area was removed with a No. 15 Bard-Parker blade. The corneas were then excised with a 1- to 2-mm scleral rim and rinsed with a serum-free medium containing penicillin G (750 μg/ml), streptomycin (750 μg/ml), amphotericin (12.5 μg/ml), and neomycin (0.44 mg/ml) for 5 to 7 min. The corneas were again rinsed in saline and incubated in serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium containing nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and antibiotics (19Soong H.K. Hassan T. Varani J. Huang S.C.M. Brennan M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1989; 107: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) at 37°C in a tissue culture incubator. The healing was monitored by staining the corneas with methylene blue (20Richardson K. Jarret L. Finke E. Stain Technol. 1960; 35: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemical analyses, after a 24-h incubation period, the corneas were processed for preparing 6-μm-thick cryosections and staining with anti-GSL mAbs. To prepare epithelia for high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)-immunostain analysis, 75 eyes were processed at a time. After incubating the injured corneas in organ culture for 24 h as described above, central 8-mm buttons were cut out with a trephine, and the migrating epithelium was collected by scraping with a No. 15 Bard-Parker blade under a dissecting microscope. The harvested epithelia were lyophilized and processed for isolation of glycolipids. At the time of harvesting migrating epithelia for both immunohistochemical and HPTLC-immunostain analyses, approximately 5- to 6-mm wounds remained de-epithelialized. To ensure minimal contamination with nonmigrating epithelium, care was taken not to let the corneas fully heal prior to collection of epithelium. To prepare nonmigrating epithelia, unscraped corneas were processed concomitantly as described above. Migrating epithelia prepared by organ culture yielded a protein value of approximately 1 mg from 50 injured corneas. Protein yield from nonmigrating epithelium was approximately 10 times greater.To analyze migrating and nonmigrating corneal epithelium in cell culture, epithelial fragments from 3 to 4 corneas were placed in 100-mm dishes and incubated in SHEM media (21Jumblatt M. Neufeld A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1983; 24: 1139-1143PubMed Google Scholar). Within 3 days, approximately 30-50% of each dish was populated with cells that were migrating away from the explants. These cells were designated “migrating” corneal epithelial cells. Within 10 to 12 days, 90-95% of the dish was populated with contact-inhibited, polygonal cells, designated “nonmigrating” corneal epithelial cells. When ready for harvesting, the cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dislodged using a cell scraper in 0.5 ml of PBS, placed into screw-cap tubes on ice, lyophilized, and processed for preparation of glycolipids. For immunohistochemical analyses, cells were cultured on glass slides instead of in cell culture dishes. Migrating and nonmigrating cells prepared by tissue culture yielded a protein value of 1.7 mg and 7 mg per 100-mm dish, respectively.Staining of Frozen Sections of Normal and Wounded Corneas and Cell Cultures with Anti-glycolipid AntibodiesA panel of four monoclonal antibodies were used for this study. mAbs 1B2 (22Young Jr., W.W.

Frozen sections and cell cultures were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (37°C, 10 min) to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were then immersed in a solution of mouse liver powder (100 μg/ml PBS) for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and sequentially incubated with the following: a monoclonal antibody (mAb CSLEX1, 10 μg/ml; all other mAbs, undiluted hybridoma fluid, 1 h), biotinylated anti-mouse IgM (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA; dilution 1:200, 1 h), a freshly prepared complex of avidin D and biotin-peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min and then diaminobenzidine-H2O2 reagent for 10 min at 37°C (26Panjwani N. Moulton P. Alroy J. Baum J. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 1280-1284PubMed Google Scholar).Isolation of Glycolipids from Migrating and Nonmigrating Corneal Epithelia Prepared by Cell and Organ CulturePrimary cell cultures from 20 to 30 dishes (100 mm) and epithelia collected from approximately 15 unscraped and 100 to 200 injured corneas in organ culture were each pooled. The glycolipids were prepared from migrating and nonmigrating epithelia using a modified extraction procedure of Folch et al. (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) to prepare a total lipid fraction. Prior to HPTLC analysis, the samples were subjected to methanolysis with 0.1 N NaOH in methanol for 1 h at 37°C to eliminate diacylphosphoglycerides. The samples were then neutralized with glacial acetic acid and passed through a reversed phase Bond-Elut cartridge (28Williams M. McCluer R. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) to remove salts. The glycolipids recovered from the Bond-Elut cartridge were separated on thin-layer chromatography plates and analyzed by HPTLC-immunostaining. High Performance Thin-layer Chromatography-Immunostaining-To identify various neolacto-GSLs of migrating and nonmigrating corneal epithelia, an HPTLC-immunostaining procedure, as described by Yamamoto et al. (24Yamamoto M. Boyer A.M. Schwarting G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), was used. Aliquots of the total lipid fractions derived from various corneal epithelia (equivalent to 0.5 to 2 mg of original protein) and various GSL standards including nLc4 prepared from human red blood cells (29Basu M. Basu S. J. Biol.

McCluer R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were chromatographed on aluminum-backed HPTLC plates (HPTLC, Alufolien, Kieselgel 60; EM Science, Cherry Hill, NJ) using a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:0.25% CaCl2, 5:4:1. Following chromatography, the chromatograms were treated with 0.05% polyisobutylmethacrylate in n-hexane for 1 min to prevent detachment of the silica gel during subsequent procedures. The plates were then sequentially incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h to block nonspecific binding, monoclonal antibody (undiluted hybridoma fluid) for 20 h at 4°C, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Cappel Laboratories, Durham, NC; 1:200 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 2 h. The chromatograms were then washed with PBS, and the antibody-reactive glycolipids were detected with a solution of 4-chloro-1-naphthol containing hydrogen peroxide (1 ml of 0.3% 4-chloronaphthol + 4 ml of 0.02 M Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5 + 3 μl of 30% H2O2) (24Yamamoto M. Boyer A.M. Schwarting G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Effect of Monoclonal Antibodies and Exogenous Glycolipids on Corneal Epithelial Cell MigrationIn an attempt to determine the role of neolacto-GSLs in corneal epithelial cell migration and wound closure, experiments were conducted to determine the effects of anti-GSL mAbs and exogenous GSLs on the rate of re-epithelialization of wounds in a cell culture model of corneal epithelial wound healing. A limited number of experiments were also performed to test the effect of exogenous GSLs on the rate of re-epithelialization of wounds of injured corneas in organ culture.To test the effect of mAbs and GSLs on corneal epithelial cell migration in a cell culture model of wound healing, the method developed by Jumblatt and Neufeld (31Jumblatt M. Neufeld A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Vis. Sci. 1986; 27: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Primary cell cultures of rabbit corneal epithelium were treated with Dispase II (Boehringer Mannheim) and were replated in 24-well Costar plates at a density of 105 cells/well. The cells were fed SHEM medium every 2 to 3 days. When the cells reached confluency, 5-mm filter discs (HA filters, Millipore) were placed on the surface of the culture in each well. The discs were gently pressed against the cultures with a sterile glass rod and then removed with forceps. The cultures were then incubated in: (i) serum-free media supplemented with 0.4% bovine serum albumin (SFB media), (ii) SFB media containing nLc4 (0.0005-1.0 μg/ml), the Lex-GSL (0.0005 to 0.1 μg/ml), ceramide trihexoside (CTH, globotriaosylceramide, Matreya Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA; 0.0005-0.10 μg/ml), or asialo-GM1 (Sigma; 0.05 μg/ml), (iii) mAb 1B2, MMA, or 2D4 (specific for asialo-GM2) hybridoma fluid, and (iv) hybridoma culture media. Prior to use, various mAbs (hybridoma fluids) and hybridoma culture media were dialyzed against MEM at 4°C for 16 to 20 h and then against MEM containing nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h. To prepare media containing glycolipids, a known amount of test glycolipids in chloroform:methanol (2:1) were dried with a stream of N2; an appropriate amount of the SFB media was added to achieve a desired concentration, and the samples were probe-sonicated using a Branson sonifer at a 4.5 constant output setting. The wounded cultures were incubated in the media containing mAbs or exogenous GSLs for 48 h. Midway through the 48-h incubation period, the media were changed once. At the end of the 48-h healing period, the media were removed by suctioning, and the size of the defect in each well was visualized by staining with full-strength Giemsa. The stained wounds were then photographed at a standard distance, and the outlines of the wound areas were traced on paper from projected images of the stained wounds. These outlines were digitized and quantitated using Sigma Scan software, and healing rates were calculated in mm2/h. An unpaired, two-group Student's t test was used to test for significance of the data. In all experiments, 5-fluorouracil (10 μg/ml) was added to the media to inhibit cell mitosis so that the effect of the mAbs and glycolipids specifically on cell migration could be evaluated.To test the effect of exogenous glycolipids on the rate of re-epithelialization of wounds of injured corneas in organ culture, corneas were prepared as described earlier except that 5-mm instead of 8-mm diameter wounds were made. The injured corneas were incubated in organ culture in 4-well Nunc plates (1 cornea/well; 1 ml of serum-free media/well) in the presence of nLc4 or control glycolipids, asialo-GM1, and CTH (0.05 μg/ml) for 20 to 24 h. The corneas were then stained with methylene blue to delineate the remaining epithelial defects. The stained wounds were then photographed, and wound areas were quantitated as described above using Sigma Scan software. Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) (100 ng/ml), which is known to stimulate corneal epithelial cell migration (19Soong H.K. Hassan T. Varani J. Huang S.C.M. Brennan M. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1989; 107: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control.RESULTSHealing of Corneas in Vivo and Organ CultureIn vivo (Fig. 1) as well as in organ culture (not shown), wound size progressively reduced with time. Complete re-epithelialization of an 8-mm wound in vivo occurred between 60 and 70 h. Re-epithelialization in organ culture was slightly slower than in vivo and required 72 to 80 h for complete wound closure.Immunohistochemical Staining with Anti-glycolipid Monoclonal AntibodiesImmunohistochemical staining of frozen sections of normal and healing corneas indicated that the leading edge of the migrating epithelium of healing corneas stained intensely with mAb 1B2 (Fig. 2C) while the basal cells of unwounded corneal epithelium did not react with this antibody (Fig. 2D). However, in some areas, there was equivocal staining of the plasma membranes of apical cells of nonmigrating epithelium with mAb 1B2 (not shown). Similar results were obtained regardless of whether the corneas were allowed to heal in vivo (n = 3) or in organ culture (n = 12). Like mAb 1B2, mAb MMA also stained the leading edge of migrating epithelia of healing corneas (Fig. 2E, n = 6). However, unlike mAb 1B2, which did not stain normal corneal epithelium, mAb MMA stained basal and middle cell layers of normal corneal epithelium at the site of cell-cell and cell matrix interactions (Fig. 2F, n = 6). Similar results were obtained with both mAbs 7A and MMA except that staining intensity with mAb 7A, in some cases, was less than that observed with mAb MMA. mAb CSLEX1 did not stain migrating corneal epithelium of healing corneas (Fig. 2G, n = 8) and stained only the apical cell layer of the epithelium of 4 of the 7 corneas analyzed (Fig. 2H).Figure 2:Immunohistochemical staining of frozen sections of normal and healing corneas with mAbs 1B2, MMA, and CSLEX1. A, C, E, and G, healing corneas stained with hematoxylin, mAb 1B2, MMA, and CSLEX1, respectively; B, D, F, and H, normal corneas stained with hematoxylin, mAb 1B2, MMA, and CSLEX1, respectively. Migrating corneal epithelium in vivo and in organ culture (not shown, staining pattern indistinguishable from corneas in vivo), stained positively with mAb 1B2 (C); in contrast, normal nonmigrating epithelium did not react with this antibody (D). mAb MMA reacted positively with migrating as well as nonmigrating epithelia; note that mAb MMA stained basal and middle cell layers at the site of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. mAb CSLEX1 did not stain migrating epithelium and stained only apical cell layers of 4 of the 7 corneas analyzed. Arrows indicate leading edge of migrating epithelium (A, C, E, and G) and the basal cell layer of normal, nonmigrating epithelium (B, D, F, and H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As was found with corneas prepared by the in vivo and organ culture methods, migrating cell cultures reacted intensely with mAb 1B2 (Fig. 3C), whereas nonmigrating cell cultures reacted poorly with this antibody (Fig. 3D). mAbs MMA and 7A stained both migrating (Fig. 3E) as well as nonmigrating (Fig. 3F) cell cultures. Since basal cells of corneal epithelium, the in vivo counterparts of cells grown in culture, did not react with mAb CSLEX1 in all 15 corneas (8 injured, 7 normal), cell cultures were not analyzed for reactivity with this mAb.Figure 3:Staining of migrating (sparse) and nonmigrating (confluent) cell cultures on glass slides with mAbs 1B2 and MMA. A, C, and E, migrating cell cultures stained with hematoxylin, mAb 1B2, and MMA, respectively. B, D, and F, nonmigrating cell cultures stained with hematoxylin, mAb 1B2, and MMA, respectively. Note that (i) migrating cell cultures (C) stained intensely, whereas nonmigrating cell cultures (D) stained weakly with mAb 1B2, and (ii) mAb MMA stained both migrating (E) as well as nonmigrating (F) cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HPTLC-Immunostaining of GlycolipidsmAb 1B2Four preparations of total lipid samples of migrating and nonmigrating epithelial cell cultures were analyzed for reactivity with mAb 1B2. In the total lipid fraction of migrating epithelia, three mAb 1B2-reactive glycolipids, nLc4, nLc6, and nLc8 were detected (Fig. 4). In contrast, in nonmigrating epithelium prepared by cell culture, the largest glycolipid (nLc8) was not detected and the other two (nLc4 and nLc6) were observed only in trace amounts (Fig. 4). All three mAb 1B2-reactive glycolipids (nLc4, nLc6, and nLc8) were detected in higher amounts in migrating than in nonmigrating cell cultures in all four preparations of epithelia analyzed. HPTLC-immunostaining experiments of total lipid fractions of epithelia prepared by organ culture demonstrated that all three mAb 1B2-reactive glycolipids (components nLc4, nLc6, and nLc8) were also present in a higher amount in migrating epithelia than in nonmigrating epithelia (Fig. 4). Two preparations of migrating and nonmigrating epithelia prepared by organ culture were analyzed with similar results. By scanning the chromatograms using a Visage 110 computer-assisted scanner (Bio Image, Millipore), it was estimated that migrating cell cultures contained at least 30 times more nLc4 and 10 times more nLc6 than nonmigrating cultures. Migrating epithelia prepared by organ culture contained 5 times more nLc4 and 8 times more nLc6 than nonmigrating epithelia.Figure 4:Immunostaining of glycolipids in the total lipid fractions of migrating and nonmigrating corneal epithelia by mAb 1B2. Migrating and nonmigrating corneal epithelia prepared by both cell and organ culture techniques were analyzed. Samples derived from 1 mg and 0.5 mg of original cell protein were chromatographed for mAb 1B2 and orcinol staining, respectively. For standard lanes, 200 ng of nLc4 was spotted. Note that regardless of whether the epithelia were prepared by organ culture or cell culture, neolactotetraosyl- (nLc4), neolactohexaosyl- (nLc6), and neolacto-octaosylceramide (nLc8) were prese"

Thus, it was inferred from two severe charge mutations that the aspartic acid residue at position 87 of GroEL is located in the ATP-binding pocket. Similarly, a cluster of GroES-binding and protein-binding double mutants was identified in the apical domain of GroEL, facing the central cavity of the GroEL14 cylinder. This area was therefore inferred to constitute a part of the protein-binding site of the chaperonin (Fenton et al., 1994Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L.

In this article, we mutated the highly conserved aspartic acid residue at position 87 of E. coli GroEL (Fig. 1) to glutamic acid. We found that this mutation primarily affects the binding of nonnative proteins to GroEL14. It also affects ATP binding and hydrolysis, but not the binding of GroES7. The groEL gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pKT200 (Bloom et al., 1986Bloom M. Skelly S. Van Bogelen R. Neidhardt F. Brot N. Weissbach H. J.

GroES was amplified from plasmid pKT200 using the DNA oligomers 5′-GACCATGGAATTCCGTCCATTGCATGATCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACCATTATCTTTATTCCTTA-3′. The amplified DNA fragments containing groES and groEL genes were introduced into the multiple cloning site of pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and called pTrcESL. The double mutant that resulted from the introduction of a SalI restriction site at the N-terminal end of GroEL (thus introducing the A to V and A to D mutations at positions 2 and 3 of GroEL, respectively) did not exhibit different in vivo behavior from the wild-type GroEL protein (Hemmingsen et al., 1988Hemmingsen S.M.

The resulting SalI-ClaI fragment, containing the D87E mutation in GroEL, was introduced into pTrcESL, and the resulting plasmid was called pTrc87. DNA sequencing of the entire groEL gene confirmed the D87E mutation. Upon induction of the trc promoter of pTrc87 with isopropyl-l-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (40 μg/ml), mutant D87E GroEL was overexpressed to a level at least 50-fold higher than that of background GroEL levels of the E. coli host.

In E. coli, the transcription of a plasmid-encoded luminescence (lux) operon from Vibrio fischeri, pChV1 (Ulitzur and Kuhn, 1988Ulitzur S. Kuhn J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1988; 2: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), requires high levels of GroEL and GroES (Adar et al., 1992Adar Y.Y. Simaan M. Ulitzur S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type E. coli cells carrying pChV1 emit levels of visible light 104-5 times higher than T850 cells carrying pChV1 (Adar et al., 1992Adar Y.Y. Simaan M. Ulitzur S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lawns of T850 carrying the compatible plasmid pTrcESL or pTrc87 in addition to pChV1 were visually tested in the dark for emission of light after a 20-h incubation at 30°C. To analyze the effect of the mutation on the structure and stability of the chaperonin oligomer, purified D87E GroEL14 molecules were observed by negative stain electron microscopy and compared with wild-type GroEL14 (Fig. 2). Mutant D87E oligomers are seen to be organized into characteristic tetradecameric double-layered cylinders (Hendrix, 1979Hendrix R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar; Hohn et al., 1979Hohn T. Hohn B. Engel A. Wurtz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which are indistinguishable from wild-type GroEL14. D87E displayed the same mobility as wild-type GroEL14 on nondenaturing 7% polyacrylamide gels and was as stable as wild-type GroEL14 in the presence of 1 M urea (data not shown). However, at variance with the wild type, mutant GroEL14 was half dissociated into monomers in the presence of 2.25 M urea (data not shown), suggesting that under extreme conditions, the mutant is more prone to dissociation than the wild-type oligomer. Finally, cross-linking with glutaraldehyde as described by Azem et al., 1994aAzem A. Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6671-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar confirmed that within the time scale of the experiments described, >95% of the mutant chaperonin was in the tetradecameric form (data not shown). Thus, the general structure of the chaperonin was not affected by the mutation. In E. coli, expression of plasmid-encoded (pChV1) luciferase operon from V. fischeri is under the transcriptional control of GroE chaperonins (Adar et al., 1992Adar Y.Y. Simaan M. Ulitzur S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7138-7143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, wild-type E. coli cells harboring plasmid pChV1 emit 104-5-fold more visible light in the early stationary phase than T850 GroEL mutant cells. When E. coli T850 mutant cells harboring the two compatible plasmids pChV1 and pTrc99A were spotted with T4 bacteriophages, a plaque did not develop (Fig. 3A, cell lawn 2) and the cell lawn emitted very low levels of light (Fig. 3B, celllawn2). When, however, the GroE-less pTrc99A plasmid was replaced by pTrcESL, the T850 cell lawn emitted high levels of light (Fig. 3B, cell lawn 1) and developed a plaque (Fig. 3A, celllawn1). When pTrcESL was replaced by pTrc87 containing GroEL with the D87E mutation, an intermediate phenotype was observed: the cell lawn emitted only low levels of light (Fig. 3B, cell lawn 3) but successfully developed a T4 plaque (Fig. 3A, celllawn3). Thus, the mutant chaperonin is partially functional in vivo. When compared with wild-type GroEL14, the chaperonin-dependent refolding of the Rubisco enzyme by mutant D87E exhibited a slower rate and reached a maximum recovery of ~25% that obtained with the wild-type chaperonin (Fig. 4). At 25°C, urea-denatured malate dehydrogenase can refold spontaneously into native enzyme (Miller et al., 1993Miller A.D. Maghlaoui K. Albanese G. Kleinjan D.A. Smith C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the presence of GroEL14, however, the malate dehydrogenase folding intermediates bind to the chaperonin and are prevented from refolding into an active enzyme. Fig. 5 shows that the concentration of D87E GroEL14 required to inhibit half the spontaneous refolding of malate dehydrogenase is four times higher than for wild-type GroEL14. This indicates that the spontaneous passive binding of nonnative protein is deficient in the mutant. When wild-type GroEL14 was first challenged with nonnative Rubisco, incubated with ATP for increasing amounts of time, and then supplemented with GroES7 to initiate refolding, no significant loss of recovered Rubisco was observed (Fig. 6, ●). In contrast, when Rubisco-bound mutant D87E GroEL14 was incubated with ATP for increasing amounts of time and then supplemented with GroES7, a significant time-dependent loss of recoverable Rubisco was observed (Fig. 6, ○). If, however, the initial incubation was carried out in the absence of ATP, no loss of recoverable Rubisco activity was observed, either for wild-type or mutant D87E GroEL14 (Fig. 6, ■ and □, respectively). These results further indicate that the binding and rebinding of nonnative protein to the chaperonin are affected by the D87E mutation. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by mutant D87E is half that of wild-type GroEL14 (Fig. 7). Table I summarizes the kinetic parameters for the ATPase activity of mutant and wild-type GroEL14. The affinity of ATP for mutant D87E was nearly an order of magnitude lower than for wild-type GroEL14. Moreover, ATP was hydrolyzed by the mutant in a noncooperative manner. However, GroES7 inhibited ATP hydrolysis similarly in mutant and wild-type GroEL (Table I). This suggests that mutant D87E is deficient in the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, but not in the ability to bind GroES7.Table ICharacteristics of ATPase activity of wild-type and mutant D87E GroELTable ICharacteristics of ATPase activity of wild-type and mutant D87E GroEL The binding of GroES7 to mutant D87E or wild-type GroEL14 oligomers in the presence of ATP was measured using chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Azem et al., 1994bAzem A. Kessel M. Goloubinoff P. Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar. In the presence of a saturating concentration of ATP, GroES7 has the same affinity for wild-type GroEL14 (Fig. 8A) as for mutant D87E GroEL14 (Fig. 8B). However, in the presence of a saturating concentration of GroES7, GroES binding requires 5.7-fold less ATP to bind wild-type GroEL14 (Fig. 8C) compared with mutant D87E (Fig. 8D). The effective concentrations of ATP necessary for the binding of GroES7 to half of the GroEL14 oligomers were 34 and 6 μM for mutant and wild-type GroEL14, respectively. This suggests that functional binding of GroES7 to GroEL14 is not directly affected by the D87E mutation, but rather through the decreased affinity of the mutant for ATP. In this work, the highly conserved residue Asp-87 of GroEL chaperonins was mutated to glutamic acid. In a GroEL-deficient E. coli host cell, plasmid-encoded mutant D87E restored phage morphogenesis as efficiently as wild-type GroEL, but not the expression of the lux operon, indicating that the mutant chaperonin is partially functional in vivo. While under extreme conditions, the D87E mutant may be less stable in vitro than wild-type GroEL14, it nevertheless assembled into a functional oligomer with the same apparent structure as wild-type GroEL14. Moreover, mutant chaperonin D87E retained, albeit at various levels, all the chaperonin functions, thereby allowing an analysis of the relationship between ATP hydrolysis, GroES binding, protein binding, and protein folding in the oligomer. The spontaneous formation of the chaperonin-malate dehydrogenase binary complex was four times less efficient for mutant D87E than for wild-type GroEL14, indicating that mutant D87E has a lower affinity for nonnative proteins. Consistent with the 4-fold reduction in the ability of the mutant chaperonin to bind nonnative malate dehydrogenase, the maximal recovery of Rubisco by the mutant, in the presence of ATP and GroES7, was ~25% that of the wild-type chaperonin (Fig. 4). The binary complex between mutant chaperonin and Rubisco was also less stable than the wild-type binary complex when incubated for increasing periods of times with ATP. Martin et al., 1991Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar suggested that ATP hydrolysis, in the absence of GroES, can cause bound proteins to undergo multiple futile cycles of release and rebinding to GroEL14. While the wild-type binary complex appeared to withstand multiple ATPase-driven cycles of protein release and rebinding without a significant loss of recoverable Rubisco, the mutant binary complex was significantly destabilized by ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 5), suggesting that the rebinding of Rubisco to the mutant is less successful than to the wild-type molecule. This demonstrates that, although the mutation is in the ATP-binding pocket, the ATP hydrolysis mechanism is functional and is capable of driving reversible conformational changes in the mutant chaperonin. Furthermore, it confirms that mutant D87E is primarily affected in its ability to initially bind and to subsequently rebind nonnative proteins during ATP-driven cycles. A kinetic analysis of ATP dependence curves of the GroEL ATPase showed that the maximal ATPase activity of the mutant was 50% that of the wild type and that the affinity of ATP for mutant D87E was an order of magnitude lower than for wild-type GroEL14. Fenton et al., 1994Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar showed that two different charge mutations at the same position, D87K and D87N, resulted in a complete loss of ATPase activity and, consequently, of the protein refolding activity and GroES binding ability. The effects of our D87E mutation as well as of D87K and D87N are compatible with the structure analysis from x-ray crystallography, which places Asp-87 in the ATP-binding pocket of GroEL (Braig et al., 1994Braig K.

The fact that a significant level of protein refolding was achieved by a mutant lacking cooperativity in ATP hydrolysis suggests that cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis may not be an absolute requirement of the chaperonin-assisted protein folding mechanism, as previously suggested (Bochkareva et al., 1992Bochkareva E.S.

Hartl F.-U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of ATP were required for the binding of GroES7 to the mutant compared with the wild-type chaperonin oligomer (Fig. 8, C and D). This can be explained by the lower affinity of mutant D87E for ATP. A titration of the GroES-dependent binding of GroES7 to GroEL14 in the presence of a saturating concentration of ATP showed that GroES7 has the same affinity for wild-type GroEL14 as for mutant D87E GroEL14 (Fig. 8, A and B). This was confirmed independently when the same concentration of GroES7 inhibited half of the ATPase activity in the wild-type oligomer compared with the mutant oligomer (Table I). Furthermore, the binding of GroES7 to the mutant was functional since it ultimately resulted in the refolding of Rubisco. A cluster of GroEL mutants, all impaired in the ability to bind nonnative proteins, was shown to be located in the apical domain of GroEL, facing the upper central cavity of the oligomer (Braig et al., 1994Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar; Fenton et al., 1994Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Remarkably, all the protein-binding mutants were also found to be impaired in the ability to interact with GroES7, suggesting that nonnative proteins and GroES7 compete for common sites in the inner face of the apical domain of the GroEL14 core oligomer (Fenton et al., 1994Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the protein-binding sites are not necessarily located in the apical region of the central cavity, but may be located on the external envelope of the GroEL14 cylinder, in the equatorial domain of GroEL (Braig et al., 1994Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). This finding is of particular importance in view of recent observations that symmetric GroEL14(GroES7)2 oligomers, in which both access ways to the central cavity are obstructed, are nevertheless fully functional chaperonins capable of successfully assisting the refolding of nonnative proteins (Azem et al., 1994bAzem A.

https://openalex.org/W1993203213,"The role of Lys-95(β), which is on the exterior of the hemoglobin (HbS) tetramer, in the aggregation process has been addressed because there is a lack of agreement on its importance. The early studies on the aggregation of HbS in the presence of other mutant hemoglobins are consistent with the subsequent electron microscopic studies in demonstrating the participation of Lys-95(β) in gelation; the results of the crystal structure do not agree with these conclusions. Therefore, with the objective of clarifying its role we have carried out site-directed substitution of Lys-95(β) to an isoleucine residue. The mutation was introduced by polymerase chain reaction recombination methodology, and the absence of other mutations in the β-globin gene was established by sequencing the gene in its entirety. The recombinant mutant hemoglobin was expressed in yeast and characterized by peptide mapping and sequencing, which demonstrated that the only different tryptic peptide had the Ile substitution at position 95(β). The recombinant hemoglobin had the correct amino acid composition and molecular weight by mass spectrometric analysis. It was also pure as judged by isoelectric focusing. It was fully functional because it had an average Hill coefficient of 3.1 and responded normally to the allosteric regulators, chloride, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and inositol hexaphosphate. Of particular interest was the finding that this hemoglobin mutant aggregated at a concentration of about 40 g/dl, nearly twice that at which HbS itself aggregated (24 g/dl). Therefore, Lys-95(β) has a very important role in the aggregation process and is a good candidate site for the design of a therapeutic agent for sickle cell anemia."

https://openalex.org/W1998277944,"A specific role for ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) in in vitro endosome-endosome fusion has been proposed (Lenhard, J. M., Kahn, R. A., and Stahl, P. D.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13047-13052). However, in vivo studies have failed to support a function for ARFs in the endocytic pathway, since an antagonist of ARF activities, brefeldin A, does not interfere with receptor internalization (Schonhorn, J. E., and Wessling-Resnick, M.(1994) Mol. Cell. Biochem. 135, 159-164). This controversy surrounding the exact function of ARF in endocytic vesicle traffic prompted us to critically re-examine the involvement of ARFs in cell-free endosome fusion. Cytosol depleted of ARF activity was capable of supporting in vitro endocytic vesicle fusion but failed to support inhibition of this reaction in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). Addition of purified ARF1 restored the ability of the ARF-depleted cytosol to inhibit endosome fusion when incubated with GTPγS. Both endocytic vesicle fusion and the GTPγS-mediated inhibition of vesicle fusion were unaffected by brefeldin A. Moreover, the ATP requirement and kinetics of cell-free fusion are not altered by brefeldin A or depletion of cytosolic ARFs. These results suggest that cytosolic ARFs are not necessary for endosomal vesicle fusion in vitro but are responsible for inhibition of fusion in the presence of GTPγS and cytosolic factors in a brefeldin A-resistant manner.

Cytosol depleted of ARF activity was capable of supporting in vitro endocytic vesicle fusion but failed to support inhibition of this reaction in the presence of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). Addition of purified ARF1 restored the ability of the ARF-depleted cytosol to inhibit endosome fusion when incubated with GTPγS. Both endocytic vesicle fusion and the GTPγS-mediated inhibition of vesicle fusion were unaffected by brefeldin A. Moreover, the ATP requirement and kinetics of cell-free fusion are not altered by brefeldin A or depletion of cytosolic ARFs. These results suggest that cytosolic ARFs are not necessary for endosomal vesicle fusion in vitro but are responsible for inhibition of fusion in the presence of GTPγS and cytosolic factors in a brefeldin A-resistant manner.

Nature. 1992; 358: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ARF activity appears to be regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis since cytosolic ARF is in a GDP-bound state while GTP-bound ARF associates with cellular membranes (5Walker M.W.

Because recruitment and dissociation of the coat proteins β-COP (6Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on these and other observations, it was proposed that ARF functions in coatomer-coated vesicle formation (9Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), although the GTP-binding protein's exact activity in the secretory pathway remains unclear (10Elazar Z. Orci L.

In addition to its proposed function in the secretory pathway, a specific role for ARF in endosome-endosome fusion was proposed based on the effects of GTPγS in several cell-free assay systems (13Mayorga L.S. Diaz R. Stahl P.D. Science. 1989; 244: 1475-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol.

Cell Regul. 1989; 1: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that GTPγS has a dual effect on endosomal fusion, stimulating fusion at low cytosolic concentrations (<0.5 mg/ml) and inhibiting fusion at concentrations of cytosol that support maximal fusion activity (0.5-2.0 mg/ml). Using a different cell-free assay, Wessling-Resnick and Braell (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described the inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion in response to the preincubation of cytosol with GTPγS. Treatment of cytosol with GTPγS causes the recruitment of cytosolic factor(s) to vesicle membranes in both of these systems (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lenhard J.M. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further work by the Stahl laboratory (18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that an N-terminal ARF peptide prevents the effects of GTPγS on endocytic vesicle fusion at low or high cytosol concentrations and that recombinant, myristoylated ARF1 inhibits this reaction in the presence of GTPγS. Based on this evidence, Lenhard et al.(18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that ARF activity is required for endosome-endosome fusion although stringent functional criteria to support this idea are lacking. For example, the N-terminal peptide's actions may be rather indirect since it alone does not affect in vitro fusion (18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, nonspecific effects associated with this peptide have been reported (19Fensome A. Cunningham E. Troung O. Cockcroft S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and a thorough investigation of the peptide's activity has revealed that this cationic amphipathic helix can cause irreversible membrane damage (20Weidman P.J. Winter W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent in vivo experiments fail to support a direct role for ARF in the endocytic pathway. Brefeldin A (BFA), an agent that blocks the catalyzed exchange of guanine nucleotides necessary to activate ARF, was found to interfere with transferrin receptor membrane traffic by slowing the rate of exocytosis and not endocytosis(21Schonhorn J.E. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, BFA does not prevent endocytosis of the low density lipoprotein receptor but causes its missorting from endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (22Matter K. Whitney A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The failure of BFA to interfere with early events of the endocytic pathway suggests that endosome fusion continues under conditions that would inactivate ARF function. These concerns prompted us to re-evaluate the role of ARF in endocytic vesicle fusion by investigating the mechanics of this reaction in the absence of the GTP-binding protein. Our results rigorously demonstrate that cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion does not require cytosolic ARFs, although in agreement with the initial observations made by Lenhard et al.(18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we find that the presence of ARFs is necessary for GTPγS-mediated inhibition. Moreover, endocytic vesicle fusion and GTPγS inhibition of vesicle fusion are not responsive to BFA under conditions where BFA inhibits the binding of ARF to Golgi membranes (23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 24Helms J.B. Rothman J.E.

Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). K562 cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 7.5% fetal calf serum as described (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (K562 or CHO) were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice. Cell pellets were resuspended in 3 volumes of uptake buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated with either 0.5 mg/ml avidin β-galactosidase or 100 nM biotin-transferrin for 60 min at 20°C. Endocytic uptake was quenched by diluting the cell suspension with 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS, followed by five washes in the same buffer at 4°C. Cells were mechanically disrupted with a stainless steel ball homogenizer with 2-7 × 107 cells/ml in ice-cold breaking buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 M KCl, 85 mM sucrose, 20 mM EGTA) until 80-90% of the cells were broken. Postnuclear supernatants (PNS) were prepared by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Vesicle fractions were separated from cytosolic proteins over a step gradient (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PNS was layered on 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM acetic acid, 10 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, and membranes were pelleted on a cushion of isotonic Nycodenz (Accurate Chemical Co.) upon centrifugation at 380,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Cytosol was prepared by centrifugation of PNS at 380,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and stored at −85°C until use. Rat liver Golgi fractions were isolated according to Tabas and Kornfeld (27Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Livers from five male rats were homogenized in 0.5 M sucrose in homogenization buffer (0.05 M Tris maleate, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl2, containing 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml soybean and lima bean trypsin inhibitors, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. The PNS was layered on top of 1.3 M sucrose in homogenization buffer and centrifuged in an SW 28 rotor at 63,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The crude smooth membrane fraction, collected above the 1.3 M sucrose layer, was adjusted to 1.1 M sucrose and layered on a sucrose step gradient as described (27Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Golgi membranes were collected at the interface between 0.5 and 1.0 M sucrose and pelleted by centrifugation in a Ti-70 rotor at 165,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The Golgi membrane pellet was resuspended in breaking buffer and frozen at −85°C until use. Preparation and characterization of ARF-depleted cytosol and bovine ARF1 have been described (2Taylor T.C. Kahn R.A. Melancon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melanon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, a soluble CHO cell extract was centrifuged at 100,00 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was fractionated over a Superdex-75 size-exclusion column. Column fractions were analyzed for the presence of 20-21-kDa GTPases using [32P]GTP-ligand blot analysis. An ARF(-) pool consisted of fractions of apparent molecular mass greater than ~35 kDa and smaller than ~15 kDa, which were concentrated to the original volume by ultrafiltration. Vesicle fusion was performed by incubating 2.5-μl samples of avidin β-galactosidase and biotin-transferrin vesicle fractions together for 30 min at 37°C in 25 μl of breaking buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgATP, 50 mg/ml creatine kinase, 8 mM phosphocreatine, 10 mg/ml biotin-cytochrome c, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μl of lysis buffer (10% Triton X-100, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mg/ml biotin-cytochrome c) and 200 μl of dilution buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml heparin); lysates were clarified by centrifugation. The complex between avidin β-galactosidase and biotin-transferrin resulting from vesicle fusion was measured by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Microstrip wells (Labsystems) were precoated with rabbit anti-human transferrin antibodies (1:500 in 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9.6). Antibody-coated wells were incubated with clarified lysates for 3 h at 37°C (or overnight at 4°C) and then rinsed free of unbound material by three washes with PBS, followed by four washes with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. The wells were incubated in the final wash at 37°C for 30 min and were rinsed once with PBS. Avidin β-galactosidase activity was then measured by incubating the wells for 3 h at 37°C with 250 μl of substrate solution (0.3 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactoside in 0.1 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 12 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were diluted into 15 volumes of 133 mM glycine, 83 mM Na2C03, pH 10.7, and the fluorescence of the hydrolysis product (365 nm excitation, 450 nm emission) was measured with an Hitachi F-2000 spectrophotometer. The resulting signal, in fluorescence units, is directly proportional to the extent of vesicle fusion in vitro(14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Braell W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated from PNS by centrifugation at 380,000 × g for 15 min, washed once, and then resuspended in breaking buffer and stored at −85°C. ARF binding reactions were carried out with PNS membranes (1.25-2 mg/ml) or rat liver Golgi (2 mg/ml) and 2-3 mg/ml K562 cell cytosol, with or without 100 μM GTPγS; these components were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 100 μl of breaking buffer supplemented with 1 mM MgATP, 50 mg/ml creatine kinase, 8 mM phosphocreatine, 10 mg/ml biotin-cytochrome c, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. MgCl2 was added to 3 mM, and the binding reaction was terminated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. Membrane pellets were washed once in breaking buffer plus 3 mM MgCl2 and then repelleted at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The ability of membrane-associated ARF to stimulate the [14C]NAD:agmatine ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin A subunit (CTA) was then assayed (29Murayama T. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9272-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.3 mg/ml ovalbumin, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTP, 2 mg/ml cardiolipin, 60 mM Cibachrome blue (Fluka), 20 mM agmatine, [14C]NAD (3 × 104 cpm/reaction) with or without 0.5 mg CTA (List Laboratories) in a total volume of 100 μl. After a 60-min incubation at 30°C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the entire sample was transferred to a column (0.5 × 2 cm) of Dowex AG 1-X2. Eluates were collected by washing columns with 5 ml of distilled, deionized H20, and [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine was measured using a Beckman LS 5000-TD liquid scintillation counter. GTPγS-dependent ARF binding was defined as the difference in [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine produced in assays with membranes that had been incubated with cytosol in the presence and absence of GTPγS. Activation of CTA ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was the same in reactions with membranes incubated with or without GTPγS but in the absence of cytosol, i.e. the effect was dependent on cytosolic ARFs. The effects of BFA on cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion were examined to further investigate the proposed activity of ARFs in this reaction. As shown by the results of Fig. 1, treatment of cytosol and membranes with BFA did not inhibit endocytic vesicle fusion. In fact, the extent of vesicle fusion was the same with or without BFA treatment. This observation is in agreement with results demonstrating that BFA interferes with exocytic and not endocytic processes (21Schonhorn J.E. Wessling-Resnick M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that in vitro intra-Golgi transport also takes place in the presence of the drug (26Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), despite the fact that BFA inhibits secretion in vivo (31Misumi Y. Misuni Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although BFA does not affect cell-free intra-Golgi transport, it does block the GTPγS-mediated inhibition of this reaction (26Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To investigate BFA effects on inhibition of endosome fusion, cytosol was also incubated with GTPγS before addition to fusion reactions (Fig. 1). At a final concentration in the assay of 1 mg/ml, GTPγS-treated cytosol inhibited fusion by ~40% while at 3 mg/ml, ~80% of this activity was blocked; these observations are compatible with the idea that a cytosolic factor promotes inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of BFA did not block GTPγS-mediated inhibition at either cytosol concentration of cytosol. Finally, although the concentration of BFA used in these experiments (200 μM) was previously documented to disrupt ARF membrane association in vitro(23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 24Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), we also examined the effects of BFA over a wide concentration range (Fig. 2). The dose-response curve reveals that treatment of membranes and cytosol with up to 500 μM BFA did not diminish that extent of endocytic vesicle fusion or prevent the inhibition of vesicle fusion by GTPγS. The results of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 indicate that if ARFs play a role in endosome fusion or the GTPγS-mediated inhibition of fusion, as has been previously suggested (18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they most likely function by a BFA-resistant mechanism. The lack of effect on cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion might suggest that in the presence of BFA, membrane fusion proceeds via an alternate pathway independent of ARF function. For example, a mechanism of “uncoupled” fusion was proposed to account for the significant level of in vitro Golgi transport observed in the absence of ARF (10Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the kinetic parameters of the in vitro reaction were examined, and it was found that BFA treatment did not significantly alter the rate or extent of endocytic vesicle fusion (Fig. 3). Rates of fusion of BFA-treated samples, 27.0 ± 7.1 units/min (n = 4), were comparable with those measured in control reactions, 24.1 ± 4.4 units/min (n = 4). The fact that the time course of endosome fusion is unaffected by BFA argues that the mechanism of endocytic vesicle fusion is not substantially altered by the presence of the drug. As a positive control for BFA effects related to ARF activity, we examined the membrane association of the GTP-binding protein in our in vitro system based on the well characterized activity of ARF as a stimulator of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (29Murayama T. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown by the results of Fig. 4, BFA reduced GTPγS-dependent ARF binding to rat liver Golgi membranes by approximately 60%, similar to previous reports (23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 24Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 25Randazzo P.A. Yang Y.C. Rulka C. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9555-9563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9272-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, GTPγS-mediated ARF binding to the K562 cell membranes present in our assay was relatively unaffected by BFA. Since the PNS membrane fraction includes Golgi, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and other intracellular membrane components, it is unclear from these experiments whether ARFs specifically associated with endocytic vesicle membranes persist in binding in the presence of BFA. The combined results of Fig. 1-3 do suggest, however, that BFA-insensitive membrane binding of cytosolic ARFs could account for the GTPγS-mediated inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion seen under our assay conditions. To critically examine whether cytosolic ARFs are responsible for GTPγS-mediated inhibition of cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion, we measured the ability of ARF-depleted CHO cytosol (11Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melanon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to support in vitro endocytic vesicle fusion. As shown in Fig. 5, ARF(-) cytosol stimulated endocytic vesicle fusion to the same extent as wild-type CHO cytosol. However, while GTPγS-treated CHO cytosol inhibited the fusion reaction by ~40%, ARF(-) cytosol incubated with GTPγS failed to block vesicle fusion. If the ARF(-) cytosol was first supplemented with 135 ng of purified bovine ARF1 and then incubated with GTPγS, inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion was recovered to levels comparable with the GTPγS-mediated inhibition observed for wild-type CHO cytosol. Under these assay conditions, the amount of ARF1 added is roughly equivalent to the native concentration of ARF in wild-type cytosol (~40 ng/μl); we estimate that ~200 ng of ARF is present in the wild-type CHO cytosol supporting fusion reactions in this experiment. Control assays were also performed in the presence of ARF1 but in the absence of GTPγS. Despite the fact that ARF1 alone causes slight inhibition of in vitro fusion activity, this effect is clearly potentiated by preincubation with the nucleotide. Thus, factors contained in ARF-depleted cytosol are both necessary and sufficient to support cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion, although an ARF or ARF-dependent function must be responsible for the inhibition of cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion in the presence of GTPγS. These results are consistent with data obtained from investigations of cell-free intra-Golgi transport in which ARF(-) cytosol was shown to support Golgi transport yet failed to inhibit transport in the presence of GTPγS (11Taylor T.C. Kanstein M. Weidman P. Melanon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction parameters in the absence of ARFs were also evaluated. As shown in the time course experiments of Fig. 6, the rates of fusion reactions performed in the presence of CHO cytosol or ARF(-) cytosol were found to be identical. Moreover, the extent of vesicle fusion in the presence and absence of ARFs is the same, confirming the results shown in Fig. 5. Finally, not only is our cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion reaction dependent on cytosolic factors, but this activity also requires ATP and is inhibited by ATPγS (14Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16751-16759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wessling-Resnick M. Braell W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 690-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to verify that fusion in the absence of cytosolic ARFs is an ATP-dependent process, CHO and ARF(-) cytosols were added to fusion assays with or without the nucleotide. The results of Fig. 7 demonstrate that in vitro fusion activity supported by either CHO or ARF(-) cytosols requires ATP. This is an important observation because other cell-free assay systems display an alternate pathway supporting endosome fusion that can be detected in the absence of ATP and cytosol (33Diaz R. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the identical kinetics and ATP dependence of vesicle fusion supported by either wild-type CHO or ARF(-) cytosol, we conclude that endosome-endosome fusion in the presence or absence of cytosolic ARFs is mediated by the exact same mechanism.Figure 7:Endocytic vesicle fusion in the absence or presence of cytosolic ARFs requires ATP. K562 cell membrane fractions were combined with CHO or ARF(-) cytosol and incubated in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regeneration system (1 mM ATP, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 8 mM phosphocreatine) or in the absence of ATP plus an ATP-depleting system (10 units/ml hexokinase, 5 mM 2-deoxyglucose). Fusion reactions were carried out as described for Fig. 1. The data presented are the average of duplicate points (±S.E.) and are representative of results obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our results establish that inhibition of cell-free endocytic vesicle fusion in the presence of GTPγS is absolutely dependent on cytosolic ARFs, in agreement with previous observations (18Lenhard J.M. Kahn R.A. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific role originally proposed for ARFs in endosome fusion fails to be supported by our demonstration that neither the rate nor the extent of fusion are altered in the absence of cytosolic ARFs. Instead, our data suggest a rather promiscuous membrane association of cytosolic ARFs in the presence of GTPγS, which disrupts vesicle-vesicle interactions and which may or may not reflect a true physiologic function. For example, ARF is known to associate with both PC12 cell membranes and liposomes in a manner that is entirely dependent on guanine nucleotides rather than specific membrane factors (5Walker M.W. Bobak D.A. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Helms et al.(34Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) also demonstrated the existence of a significant pool of ARFs that are loosely associated with Golgi membranes and readily extracted with liposomes. Such nonspecific interactions would not only account for our in vitro results with GTPγS but would also readily explain the pleiotropic effects observed in vivo with a GTPase-defective mutant of ARF1, which disrupts membrane traffic, including endocytosis (35Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhang C.-J. Rosenwald A.G. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, one could argue that a membrane-bound form of ARF that is resistant to BFA mediates endosome-endosome fusion. Such a proposal would be consistent with our observation that the effects of GTPγS on endosome fusion are not reversed by BFA, unlike the results obtained for intra-Golgi transport assays (26Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and that less than 10% of GTPγS-dependent ARF binding is blocked by BFA in the crude PNS fractions that provide the endocytic vesicles under study. In fact, recent studies on the overexpression of ARF6 demonstrate a plasma membrane/endosomal distribution of this isoform (37D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 38Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, the fact that GTPγS does not inhibit the endosome fusion assay in the absence of cytosolic ARFs clearly argues against this idea. A model in which membrane-associated BFA-insensitive ARFs play a role in endosome fusion would require that GTP hydrolysis is not essential for ARF function or that ARFs remain stably associated with membranes in the GTP-bound state and unable to bind GTPγS. Neither of these caveats is compatible with known properties of ARFs, since GDP-bound ARF does not bind membranes (5Walker M.W. Bobak D.A. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3230-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GTP hydrolysis is rapidly catalyzed upon ARF association with the Golgi (23Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 24Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Curiously, a defective GTP-binding mutant of ARF6 does appear to remain associated with endosomal structures (presumably in the GDP-bound state); however, this mutant disrupts recycling of transferrin receptors (37D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and is localized on endosomal domains that appear to be coated (38Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been postulated ARF6 may promote budding of transport vesicles from the endosome (37D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), making a role for this isoform in endosome fusion unlikely. It still remains to be determined if GTPγS-mediated inhibition of endosome fusion by ARF involves other factors. Since specific binding of ARFs to Golgi membranes and their function in coatomer complex recruitment have been well documented (6Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 7Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J.

Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is possible that these events contribute to the pattern of inhibition observed in our assay system. One can envision that during coatomer assembly, universal factors necessary for membrane traffic may be sequestered. This recruitment by ARF of important elements of the fusion machinery onto the surface of other membranes may consequently result in the inhibition of our assay. If this possibility is correct, then inhibition of endosome-endosome fusion by ARF in the presence of GTPγS must involve other cytosolic factors, a prediction that we are currently evaluating. These ongoing experiments may elucidate novel features of ARF's function in the regulation of intracellular membrane traffic."
https://openalex.org/W2427500856,"The Planck-Benzinger thermal work function, ΔW0(T), represents the heat-flux term which is responsible for breaking or forming the noncovalent bonds in macromolecular interactions, while the temperature-invariant chemical bond energy, ΔH0(T0), gives molecules the cohesiveness to form macromolecular structures. A method is described for evaluating ΔH0(T0) at different temperatures for ribonuclease A at low pH in the standard state, in order to determine the effect of pH on the thermodynamic stability of this protein. Ribonuclease A at pH 1.13 has a ΔH0(T0) value of 58 kcal mol-1; at pH 2.50, ΔH0(T0) is 58, at pH 2.77, 59, and at pH 3.15, 60 kcal mol-1. In the conformational thermal transition of ribonuclease A at pH 2.8, the compensatory temperature ranges from 50 to 320 K, and ΔH0(T0) is approximately 5~6 kcal mol-1. This widening temperature range is typical of the unfolding process. Such differences in the magnitude of the temperature-invariant chemical bond energy can be attributed to specific changes in the solvent ordering in the immediate domain of ribonuclease A."
