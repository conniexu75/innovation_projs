https://openalex.org/W2141652419,"The fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most intensively studied organisms in biology and serves as a model system for the investigation of many developmental and cellular processes common to higher eukaryotes, including humans. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the ∼120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes ∼13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegans genome, but with comparable functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1635391495,"We report on the quality of a whole-genome assembly of Drosophila melanogaster and the nature of the computer algorithms that accomplished it. Three independent external data sources essentially agree with and support the assembly's sequence and ordering of contigs across the euchromatic portion of the genome. In addition, there are isolated contigs that we believe represent nonrepetitive pockets within the heterochromatin of the centromeres. Comparison with a previously sequenced 2.9- megabase region indicates that sequencing accuracy within nonrepetitive segments is greater than 99. 99% without manual curation. As such, this initial reconstruction of the Drosophila sequence should be of substantial value to the scientific community."

Long-term potentiation (LTP) or increased activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) induced delivery of tagged AMPA-Rs into synapses. This effect was not diminished by mutating the CaMKII phosphorylation site on the GluR1 AMPA-R subunit, but was blocked by mutating a predicted PDZ domain interaction site. These results show that LTP and CaMKII activity drive AMPA-Rs to synapses by a mechanism that requires the association between GluR1 and a PDZ domain protein."
https://openalex.org/W1985850927,"A productive angiogenic response must couple to the survival machinery of endothelial cells to preserve the integrity of newly formed vessels. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) is an endothelium-specific ligand essential for embryonic vascular stabilization, branching morphogenesis, and post-natal angiogenesis, but its contribution to endothelial cell survival has not been completely elucidated. Here we show that Ang-1 acting via the Tie 2 receptor induces phosphorylation of the survival serine-threonine kinase, Akt (or protein kinase B). This is associated with up-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitor, survivin, in endothelial cells and protection of endothelium from death-inducing stimuli. Moreover, dominant negative survivin negates the ability of Ang-1 to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis. The activation of anti-apoptotic pathways mediated by Akt and survivin in endothelial cells may contribute to Ang-1 stabilization of vascular structures during angiogenesis, in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2029870968,"Femtosecond synchrotron pulses were generated directly from an electron storage ring. An ultrashort laser pulse was used to modulate the energy of electrons within a 100-femtosecond slice of the stored 30-picosecond electron bunch. The energy-modulated electrons were spatially separated from the long bunch and used to generate approximately 300-femtosecond synchrotron pulses at a bend-magnet beamline, with a spectral range from infrared to x-ray wavelengths. The same technique can be used to generate approximately 100-femtosecond x-ray pulses of substantially higher flux and brightness with an undulator. Such synchrotron-based femtosecond x-ray sources offer the possibility of applying x-ray techniques on an ultrafast time scale to investigate structural dynamics in condensed matter."
https://openalex.org/W1990285428,"Microstructured particles were synthesized by growing colloidal crystals in aqueous droplets suspended on fluorinated oil. The droplets template highly ordered and smooth particle assemblies, which diffract light and have remarkable structural stability. The method allows control of particle size and shape from spheres through ellipsoids to toroids by varying the droplet composition. Cocrystallization in colloidal mixtures yields anisotropic particles of organic and inorganic materials that can, for example, be oriented and turned over by magnetic fields. The results open the way to controllable formation of a wide variety of microstructures."

We describe a general strategy for producing such collections and its implementation, which so far has generated a set of cDNAs corresponding to over 40% of the genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W1975860235,"The observed global warming of the past century occurred primarily in two distinct 20-year periods, from 1925 to 1944 and from 1978 to the present. Although the latter warming is often attributed to a human-induced increase of greenhouse gases, causes of the earlier warming are less clear because this period precedes the time of strongest increases in human-induced greenhouse gas (radiative) forcing. Results from a set of six integrations of a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model suggest that the warming of the early 20th century could have resulted from a combination of human-induced radiative forcing and an unusually large realization of internal multidecadal variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. This conclusion is dependent on the model's climate sensitivity, internal variability, and the specification of the time-varying human-induced radiative forcing."
https://openalex.org/W1966828910,"Correct positioning of the mitotic spindle is critical for cell division and development. Spindle positioning involves a search-and-capture mechanism whereby dynamic microtubules find and then interact with specific sites on the submembrane cortex. Genetic, biochemical, and imaging experiments suggest a mechanism for cortical-microtubule capture. Bim1p, located at microtubule distal ends, bound Kar9p, a protein associated with the daughter cell cortex. Bim1p is the yeast ortholog of human EB1, a binding partner for the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor. EB1 family proteins may have a general role in linking the microtubule cytoskeleton to cortical polarity determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2026079063,"Sensory axons become functional late in development when Schwann cells (SC) stop proliferating and differentiate into distinct phenotypes. We report that impulse activity in premyelinated axons can inhibit proliferation and differentiation of SCs. This neuron-glial signaling is mediated by adenosine triphosphate acting through P2 receptors on SCs and intracellular signaling pathways involving Ca2+, Ca2+/calmodulin kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element binding protein, and expression of c-fos and Krox-24. Adenosine triphosphate arrests maturation of SCs in an immature morphological stage and prevents expression of O4, myelin basic protein, and the formation of myelin. Through this mechanism, functional activity in the developing nervous system could delay terminal differentiation of SCs until exposure to appropriate axon-derived signals."
https://openalex.org/W2022807358,"The Ras oncogene regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and survival through multiple downstream signals. Ras signals through its effector phosphoinositide 3 (PI3) kinase to the Pak protein kinase (p65 pak), but the steps from Ras to Pak remain to be elucidated. PI3 kinase can stimulate the small G protein, Rac, a direct activator of Pak, as well as the Akt proto-oncogene, a serine-threonine protein kinase. We found that activated Akt stimulated Pak, whereas a dominant negative Akt inhibited Ras activation of Pak in transfection assays. Akt stimulation of Pak was not inhibited by dominant negative mutants of either Rac or Cdc42 suggesting that Akt activated Pak through a GTPase-independent mechanism. We also developed a novel cell-free system to study Ras activation of Pak. In this system Ras activated Pak only in the presence of a crude cell extract but failed to activate Pak when Akt was immunodepleted from the extract. Akt protects cells from apoptosis through phosphorylation of downstream targets such as the Bcl-2 family member, Bad. We found that activated Pak decreased apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of Bad, whereas dominant negative Pak increased apoptosis and decreased phosphorylation of Bad.

This is achieved through the coordinated regulation of multiple signals. The Ras oncogene, a small G protein, can promote these three events through downstream targets such as Raf and phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)1 kinase (1.Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.R. Annu. Rev.

Another family of effectors downstream of PI3 kinase are the serine-threonine kinases p65 pak (Pak), which are direct targets of both Rac and Cdc42 (13.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S.

In many cells Pak mediates signals directly from Ras through PI3 kinase to sustain cell transformation, but the steps from PI3 kinase to Pak remain poorly understood (16.Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we show that Akt is a key intermediate between Ras and Pak. In addition, activated Pak decreases apoptosis, whereas dominant negative Pak increases apoptosis. These studies define a new Akt survival signal. Rat-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of Pak, 1.5 μg of each test plasmid, and 2.5–4 μg of pUC19 plasmid, as required, to bring the total to 5 μg of total DNA. The plasmids and immune kinase assays to measure Pak activity have been described elsewhere (6.Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

H-Ras was purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. K-Ras 4B-D12 was purified from a baculovirus expression system using DE-52 chromatography and a gel filtration column as described (20.Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Bradley S. Rhodes S. Sydenham M. Paterson H.

Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis with 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Samples were then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and frozen until needed. Ras was activated by incubating 2 μg of Ras in 1 mm GTP, 50 mm EDTA for 1 h followed by treatment with 50 mmMgCl2. Pak was prepared from Rat-1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged Pak1 and incubated with 9E10 antibody and protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were mixed for 30 min on a rotating incubator at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with 2× phosphorylation buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Samples were then incubated with 5 μg of peptide p47 phox 324–331 (21.Knaus U. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) for 5 min on ice. Kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 20 μm (final concentration) ATP following incubation for 20 min at 22 °C. Next, 25 μl of the reaction samples were loaded onto SpinZyme™ phosphocellulose units (Pierce), centrifuged through the membrane into collection tubes (for 30 s), washed twice with 500 μl of wash solution (75 mm phosphoric acid), and filters were counted. Several proteins are regulated by PI3 kinase including the Akt protein kinase and the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). To test whether Akt signals to Pak, we co-transfected Akt into Rat-1 cells and assayed Pak in an immune kinase assay using MBP as a substrate. Akt stimulated Pak about 10-fold over basal levels, whereas activated Pak failed to stimulate Akt (Fig.1; data not shown for Akt kinase assays). Pak stimulation was seen following overexpression of two different Akt constructs, wild-type and membrane-targeted Akt but not K179M, a kinase-deficient mutant. In most experiments stimulation by Akt was about half the maximum observed with Rac and about the same as that observed with PI3 kinase. The p70S6K inhibitor, rapamycin, had no effect (data not shown). These data suggest that Akt but not p70S6K is upstream of Pak. To determine whether Akt was required to mediate the signal from Ras to Pak we tested K179M, a dominant negative Akt mutant. K179M inhibited both Ras and PI3 kinase activation of Pak but not Rac activation of Pak (Fig. 2 a). LY294002, a specific PI3 kinase inhibitor, inhibited both Ras and PI3 kinase activation of Pak but did not block Akt or Rac activation of Pak (Fig.2 b). These experiments place Akt downstream of Ras and PI3 kinase but upstream of, or perhaps parallel to, Rac. To place Akt relative to Rac and Cdc42 we tested the effects of the dominant negative mutants RacN17 and Cdc42N17 on Akt activation of Pak. Although both dominant negative mutants partially blocked Ras activation of Pak, neither mutant inhibited Akt activation of Pak (Fig. 2 c). Together these data suggest that Akt is an essential mediator of Ras activation of Pak but stimulates Pak independently of Rac and Cdc42. To confirm the transfection studies we developed a cell-free system as an independent assay for Ras activation of Pak. In this system purified recombinant H-Ras or K-Ras (K-Ras 4B-D12) is incubated with extracts from cells expressing Myc-tagged Pak, Pak is then immunoisolated, and its activity is measured using MBP as a substrate (Fig.3 a). Pak was activated with Ras-GTP, but not Ras-GDP or GTP alone. Hence, only the GTP-activated Ras activates Pak. We modified the cell-free system by employing a rapid filter binding assay to measure phosphorylation of a specific Pak substrate, a peptide derived from the p47 phox phosphorylation site (21.Knaus U. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). With this modified assay, the three key components, Ras-GTP, Pak (immunoisolated from transfected Rat-1 cells), and the cell lysate (prepared from untransfected cells), are added separately, which allowed us to rapidly screen different cells. Extracts from Rat-1 cells, MCF-7 cells, Schwann cells, pig brain, and pig spleen all supported substantial levels of Pak activation, but NIH 3T3 cells showed minimal complementation (Fig. 3 b; data shown only for Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 cells). In addition, Ras stimulated the activity of immunoisolated Pak1, Pak2, and Pak3 from Rat-1 cells (data not shown). Thus the Ras to Pak signal is common to many cell types and multiple Pak isoforms. Next, to test whether Akt was required in the cell-free system, we depleted the Rat-1 extracts with anti-Akt antibodies (Fig. 3 c, inset). Extract incubated with Akt antibodies was almost devoid of activity, whereas extracts incubated with either a nonspecific control antibody or with an antibody against p70S6K still supported robust activation (Fig. 3 c). We obtained similar results when we substituted Pak purified from a baculovirus expression system for the immunoisolated Pak in these experiments (data not shown). These experiments support data from the transfection assays that suggest that Akt, but not p70S6K, mediates Ras activation of Pak. Akt mediates signals from Ras and PI3 kinase to promote survival in part by phosphorylating and inactivating apoptotic factors such as Bad (22.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Master S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar, 23.del Peso L. Gonzàlez-Garcı́a M. Page C. Herrera R. Nuñez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Because Pak is downstream of Akt, we determined whether Pak affects cell survival signals. We tested PI3 kinase-dependent survival by inducing apoptosis by serum starvation or serum starvation combined with 20 μmLY294002. This concentration was chosen because it inhibits Ras activation of Pak about 80% in transfection assays (18.Tang Y., Yu, J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and produces a moderate amount of cell death, which allows detection of both increases and decreases in apoptosis (data not shown). Cells treated under both conditions displayed changes characteristic of apoptosis, including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and DNA fragmentation. To test the role of Pak, we utilized G418-selected mass cultures of Rat-1 cells stably expressing Pak mutants. The cell lines that we generated express Pak at levels about 2-fold above the endogenous Pak1. The constructs used in these studies were wild-type Pak1, Pak1L83,L86 (activated Pak), Pak1R299, and Pak1L83,L86,R299. The latter two mutants are kinase-deficient; PakL83,L86,R299 also fails to bind Rac and Cdc42. Both kinase-deficient mutants inhibit Ras signaling and transformation in many cell lines and are specific inhibitors of Pak, and cell lines expressing these mutants are resistant to Ras transformation (16.Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17.Tang Y. Marwaha S. Rutkowski J.L. Tennekoon G.I. Phillips P.C. Field J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5139-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In each paradigm, activated Pak1, PakL83,L86, protected cells by delaying apoptosis, whereas both PakR299 and PakL83,L86,R299 stimulated cells to initiate apoptosis earlier than control cells. Wild-type Pak had no effect (Fig. 4 a; data not shown for serum starvation alone). In another paradigm, a transiently transfected kinase-deficient Pak mutant increased apoptosis and reduced protection by transfected Akt (Fig. 4 b). The data in Fig. 4, a and b, suggest that Pak mediates cell survival signals downstream of PI3 kinase and Akt. One of the downstream targets of Akt associated with cell survival is Bad, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is inactivated by phosphorylation. Pak also phosphorylates Bad in vivo andin vitro at the key regulatory residues, Serines 112 and 136, which correlates with a cell-protective function (24.Schürmann A. Mooney A.F. Sanders L.C. Sells M.A. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We determined the levels of phosphorylated Bad in the cell lines expressing Pak using a phosphospecific antibody for Serine 136 of Bad (Fig. 4 c). In parental cells and cells transfected with kinase-inactive Pak mutants we were unable to detect any phosphorylated Bad. However, significantly more phosphorylated Bad was observed in cells expressing both wild-type and the activated Pak1L83,L86. All of the cell lines expressed comparable levels of Bad, suggesting that Pak does not alter the levels of Bad expressed in cells. We found that the levels of Bad expressed in our cells were too low to reliably measure, so we developed a transfection assay to test the role of Pak relative to Akt in Bad signaling. This assay measured phosphorylation of transfected Bad. As observed in the stable cell lines, we found that transfection of Pak1L83,L86 stimulated Bad phosphorylation (Fig.4 d), whereas the two dominant negative Pak1 mutants did not. Wild-type Pak also stimulated phosphorylation of Bad but not as effectively as Pak1L83,L86. Furthermore, the two dominant negative Pak1 mutants inhibited Ras-, PI3 kinase-, and Akt-stimulated phosphorylation, whereas dominant negative Akt did not inhibit Pak-stimulated phosphorylation of Bad (Fig. 4, e andf). These data suggest that Pak can mediate signals from Akt to Bad. We provide four lines of evidence that Akt mediates the signal from Ras to Pak. First, overexpression of wild-type Akt or an activated Akt mutant stimulates Pak; second, a kinase-deficient Akt mutant inhibits Ras activation of Pak; third, extracts depleted of Akt fail to support Ras activation of Pak in a cell-free system; and fourth, we placed Pak downstream of Akt in signals to Bad. Together, these data suggest a Ras→PI3 kinase→Akt→Pak→Bad signal (Fig.5). This signal promotes cell survival, because expression of activated Pak delays apoptosis, whereas expression of two dominant negative mutants of Pak enhances apoptosis. A total of three apoptosis paradigms that utilize Ras signaling pathways yielded similar results. Together, these data suggest that Pak promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Bad is one target that may mediate the cell survival function of Pak, but other potential survival targets include members of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade (16.Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4454-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25.King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Akt activation of Pak occurs downstream of PI3 kinase, because kinase-deficient Akt blocks both Ras and PI3 kinase activation of Pak. Interestingly, unlike almost all known activators of Pak including Ras and PI3 kinase, neither Rac nor Cdc42 are required for Akt activation of Pak. The simplest model is that Akt phosphorylates Pak to stimulate its activity, because activation of Pak by Akt requires a functional kinase activity. However, Akt is activated by PI3 kinase through direct and indirect mechanisms, and the Akt regulatory kinase, PDK1, can phosphorylate Pak, so the stimulation of Pak by Akt may come about through multiple mechanisms (27.Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). 2Gary Bokoch, personal communication. Although the Akt pathway is sufficient for activation, our data also suggest, however, that signals from both Akt and Rac/Cdc42 contribute to Ras activation of Pak in vivo. Hence, Pak activation may be analogous to Ras activation of Raf where a small G protein and protein kinases coordinate signals. Although Ras can bind and activate Raf, sustained activation is achieved after Ras recruits Raf to the membrane where it is phosphorylated by several protein kinases including Src and Pak (25.King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic roles for Pak. In Xenopus oocytes Pak activation is anti-apoptotic (29.Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, another member of the Pak family, Pak2, is cleaved and activated by caspase 3. Caspase-activated Pak2 induces a number of morphological features associated with apoptosis including cell shrinkage, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and formation of apoptotic bodies (30.Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 31.Lee N. MacDonald C. Halenbeck R. Roulston A. Shi T. Williams L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13642-13647Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Pak1 is not a substrate for caspases; therefore, depending on the susceptibility to caspase cleavage, different members of the Pak family may either perform pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic functions. This is similar to Bcl-2 family members that switch from anti-apoptotic to pro-apoptotic roles following caspase cleavage (32.Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K.

Therefore agents that inhibit Pak, like those that inhibit Ras processing (28.Barrington, R., Subler, M., Rands, E., Omer, C., Miller, P., Hundley, J., Koester, S., Troyer, D., Bearss, D., Conner, M., Gibbs, J., Hamilton, K., Koblan, K., Mosser, S., O'Neill, T., Schaber, M., Senderak, E., Windle, J., Oliff, A., and Kohl, N.

In yeast, oriented cytoplasmic microtubules align the mitotic spindle between mother and bud. The cortical marker protein Kar9 localizes to the bud tip and is required for the orientation of microtubules toward this region. Here, we show that Kar9 directs microtubule orientation by acting through Bim1, a conserved microtubule-binding protein. Bim1 homolog EB1 was originally identified through its interaction with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor, raising the possibility that an APC-EB1 linkage orients microtubules in higher cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086076030,"Along with the inositol trisphosphate-induced release of stored Ca2+, a receptor-enhanced entry of Ca2+ is a critical component of intracellular Ca2+ signals generated by agonists acting at receptors coupled to the activation of phospholipase C. Although the simple emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores is known to be capable of activating Ca2+ entry via the so-called “capacitative” mechanism, recent evidence suggests that Ca2+ entry at physiological agonist concentrations, where oscillatory Ca2+ signals are typically observed, does not conform to such a model. Instead, a noncapacitative Ca2+entry pathway regulated by arachidonic acid appears to be responsible for Ca2+ entry under these conditions. Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques we demonstrate that low concentrations of arachidonic acid activate a Ca2+-selective current that is superficially similar to the store-operated current I CRAC, but which also demonstrates certain distinct features. We have named this novel currentI ARC (forarachidonate-regulated calcium current). Importantly, I ARC can be readily activated in cells whose Ca2+ stores have been maximally depleted.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 2.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). This capacitative entry, which occurs via store-operated channels (SOCs),1 underlies both the sustained elevations in [Ca2+]i observed following stimulation with high agonist concentrations and the subsequent refilling of intracellular agonist-sensitive Ca2+ stores on the termination of such signals (1.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 2.Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). However, physiological concentrations of appropriate agonists often result in oscillatory [Ca2+]i signals where the internal Ca2+ stores empty only partially and/or transiently making a capacitative mechanism for the control of Ca2+ entry unlikely (3.Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many of the specific characteristics of the Ca2+ entry seen during such signals, as well as the properties of those capacitative channels characterized to date, are inconsistent with such a role (3.Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, we have described a novel mechanism of agonist-activated Ca2+ entry that is independent of store depletion (i.e.noncapacitative) (4.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and which appears to be specifically responsible for the entry of Ca2+ seen following stimulation with low agonist concentrations, such as those resulting in Ca2+oscillations (5.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The signal responsible for the activation of the entry of Ca2+ under these circumstances is a receptor-mediated generation of arachidonic acid (5.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Three key pieces of evidence support this contention: 1) arachidonic acid is generated at the same agonist concentrations that are known to produce [Ca2+]i oscillations in the same cells, 2) addition of low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid induces an entry of Ca2+ that is entirely independent of store depletion, and 3) inhibition of the agonist-induced generation of arachidonic acid specifically and rapidly blocks the Ca2+entry associated with [Ca2+]i oscillations, yet it is without effect on capacitative Ca2+ entry (5.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that this Ca2+ entry pathway, which is activated by arachidonic acid itself not a metabolite (6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), is entirely distinct from the capacitative or store-operated pathway (7.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using whole-cell patch clamp techniques we have now characterized the current associated with this novel arachidonic acid-regulated Ca2+ entry pathway and demonstrate that it possesses certain unique properties that clearly distinguish it fromI CRAC, the archetypal store-operated Ca2+ channel current (8.Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 9.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have named this novel current I ARC, for a rachidonate- r egulated c alcium current. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the human m3 muscarinic receptor were a generous gift from Dr. Craig Logsdon (University of Michigan). The cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 as reported previously (6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto glass coverslips that formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber (Warner) immediately before experimentation. Whole-cell currents were recorded with an Axopatch-1C patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments) using standard patch clamp techniques at room temperature (20–22 °C). Patch pipettes (Garner, GC150-F) were fire-polished to a resistance of 3–6 megaOhms. Whole-cell currents were recorded using 250-ms voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 to −80 mV delivered every 2 s. Alternatively, current-voltage relationships were recorded using 150-ms voltage ramps from −100 to +30 mV. Ramps were terminated at +30 mV to avoid activation of a depolarization-activated Cl−current. Currents were sampled at 20 kHz during the voltage steps and 5.5 kHz during voltage ramps and digitally filtered off-line at 1 KHz. Initial traces obtained on going whole-cell (i.e. before activation of I ARC orI SOC) were averaged and used for leak subtraction. Internal solutions contained (in mm): Cs+ acetate, 140; NaCl, 10; MgCl2, 1.22; CaCl2, 1.89; EGTA, 5; HEPES, 10 (pH 7.2). The free Ca2+ concentration of this solution was calculated to be 100 nm as computed with Maxchelator (12.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). CaCl2was omitted for the experiments involving Ca2+-free internal solutions. Extracellular solutions contained (in mm): NaCl, 140; MgCl2, 1.2; CaCl2, 10; CsCl, 5; d-glucose, 10; HEPES, 10 (pH 7.4) unless otherwise specified. Both MgCl2 and CaCl2 were omitted from this solution for the experiments involving divalent-free external solutions and the osmolarity (320 mosmol/liter) was maintained with additional d-glucose. Fast inactivation/activation was examined by comparing peak and steady-state currents during hyperpolarizing pulses to −80 mV. Examination of the capacitative currents during pulses to −80 mV indicated a mean time constant for the capacitative transient of 240 ± 7.6 μs (n = 159). To minimize contributions from these transients, peak currents (1 ms average) were determined at a point 3 ms after the start of the hyperpolarizing pulse. Steady-state currents were similarly determined at a point 200 ms later. Arachidonic acid was purchased from BioMol and all other chemicals from Sigma. To observe potential Ca2+ entry currents, hyperpolarizing voltage pulses were applied from a holding potential of 0 to −80 mV. Under these conditions, basal currents were usually small and variable (typically ranging between +0.2 and −0.3 pA/pF). 2Occasionally, a current was observed to spontaneously activate in the whole-cell mode. This current was much larger than either the endogenous store-operated current or the arachidonate-activated current (∼1.8 pA/pF at −80 mV compared with ∼0.6 pA/pF), and demonstrated a linear I/V curve with a reversal potential close to zero. Based on this evidence it would appear that this spontaneously activating current was nonselective for cations. Addition of arachidonic acid (8 μm) to the bath resulted in the activation of a small inward current that averaged 0.56 ± 0.05 pA/pF at −80 mV (n = 10) (Fig.1 A). Taking all experiments together, activation was seen in 76% of cells (n = 120). Current-voltage relationships of the arachidonic acid-activated current were obtained by applying voltage ramps after subtracting leak currents. This current shows strong inward rectification and a reversal potential more positive than +30 mV (Fig. 1 B). The arachidonate-induced current was fully and reversibly inhibited by 50 μm La3+, a potent blocker of Ca2+influx (Fig. 1, A and B). Addition of 50 μm Cd2+, another blocker of Ca2+influx, produced a similar, although somewhat less complete, inhibition (approximately 85%; data not shown). Plots of the mean amplitude of the arachidonate-activated currents against membrane potential demonstrate that the magnitude of the current is reasonably consistent between cells (Fig. 1 C). Complete substitution of extracellular Na+ with NMDG+ had no significant effect on the magnitude of the inward current measured at −80 mV (0.57 ± 0.05 pA/pF in Na+ solutions versus0.49 ± 0.03 pA/pF in NMDG+ solutions,n = 4, p < 0.05) and only a minor effect on the overall I/V curve for the arachidonate-activated current, indicating only a minimal permeability for Na+ in the presence of external Ca2+. This, together with the strong inward rectification, very positive reversal potential (>+30 mV), and potent inhibition by La3+ and Cd2+ are all consistent with the arachidonate-regulated current being a Ca2+ current (=I ARC). As such, these properties are very similar to those demonstrated by the only store-operated current that has been extensively characterized to date, namely the calcium release-activated current (I CRAC) originally described in mast cells, T lymphocytes, and RBL cells (8.Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 9.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6259-6299Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 10.Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 11.McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the clear and critical distinction between these two currents is that, unlike I CRAC, activation ofI ARC is entirely independent of store depletion. Another feature of store-operated Ca2+ currents such asI CRAC is that, on removal of extracellular divalent cations, they become highly permeable to monovalent ions (10.Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref Scopus (662) Google Scholar,11.McDonald T.V. Premack B.A. Gardner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3889-3896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lepple-Wienhues A. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 7: 787-794Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14.Kerschbaum H.H. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen.

This is also seen in voltage-activated Ca2+currents (16.Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 17.Almers W. McCleskey E.W. Palade P.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 353: 565-583Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the same phenomenon was shown by I ARC. In nominally divalent-free extracellular solutions, addition of 8 μm arachidonic acid elicited a large inward current that was inhibited by La3+ (50 μm) (Fig. 1 D). This activation of a monovalent current was rapidly reversed on restoration of extracellular divalent ions, demonstrating that it is not a simple leak current. The magnitude of the monovalent current was approximately 50-fold larger than the normal Ca2+ current measured in the presence of extracellular divalent ions (27.6 ± 1.7 pA/pF,n = 11 versus 0.56 ± 0.05 pA/pF). Like the Ca2+ current in normal medium, the monovalent current observed in divalent-free solutions shows marked inward rectification (Fig. 1 E). However, with Na+-containing internal (pipette) solutions, the monovalent current observed in divalent-free extracellular solution reverses near 0 mV, and an outward current is observed at positive potentials. It should be noted that these features clearly distinguish this monovalent current from the spontaneous nonselective current sometimes observed initially on going whole-cell (see above). The outward current that is seen with Na+-containing pipette solutions in the absence of extracellular divalent cations is not seen with NMDG+ as the main internal cation (Fig. 1 E), indicating that it likely reflects Na+ and/or Cs+ moving outwards through the ARC channels. I CRAC has also been demonstrated to display a pronounced fast inactivation during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses that operates with a time constant of approximately 10–30 ms (18.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19.Fierro L. Parekh A.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This fast inactivation is reported to be Ca2+-dependent and to reflect a feedback process driven by local Ca2+ domains near the mouth of the CRAC channels (18.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19.Fierro L. Parekh A.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To examine this phenomenon inI ARC, peak and steady-state arachidonate-activated currents were recorded during hyperpolarizing pulses to −80 mV. In these experiments, extracellular Ca2+was raised from 10 to 20 mm to maximize any Ca2+-dependent inactivation. This increase in extracellular Ca2+ did not produce any significant increase in the measured steady-state arachidonate-activated current (0.58 ± 0.06 pA/pF at −80 mV, n = 9). Comparison of the measured peak and steady-state currents revealed that most cells studied (8/11) showed either no significant change in the measured current or a slight increase (Fig.2 A). In the remaining three cells, a significant (i.e. >10%) inactivation was recorded. The mean result from all 11 cells showed a 10.7 ± 10.9% increase in current indicating that, in marked contrast with I CRAC, I ARCdoes not show any consistent fast inactivation, at least under the conditions used in these experiments. As the endogenous store-operated Ca2+ channels of HEK293 cells have only been briefly described (20.Fasolato C. Nilius B. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it was important to confirm that this lack of any significant fast inactivation was genuinely a unique feature ofI ARC and not an unusual property of the endogenous store-operated Ca2+ channels of the m3-HEK cells. We therefore examined the store-operated currents (I SOC) in the m3-HEK cells. Intracellular stores were depleted by using a Ca2+-free pipette solution. Under these conditions, the stores passively become depleted due to the inability of the SERCA pumps responsible for replenishing them to operate. The magnitude of the resulting currents (m3-HEKI SOC) measured at −80 mV with an external Ca2+ concentration of 20 mm was 0.60 ± 0.06 pA/pF (n = 10). These currents showed marked inward rectification and a reversal potential significantly more positive than +30 mV (Fig. 2 B). Removal of extracellular divalent cations resulted in the appearance of large current carried by monovalent ions (not shown). As such, the m3-HEKI SOC demonstrated properties that were broadly consistent with those previously reported forI CRAC (8.Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 9.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6259-6299Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and with the earlier brief description of I CRAC-like currents in the parental HEK293 cells (20.Fasolato C. Nilius B. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Examination of the change in the magnitude of the m3-HEK I SOC during pulses to −80 mV using the protocol described above revealed a highly consistent fast inactivation (Fig. 2 C) amounting to 25.5 ± 2.1% with a time constant of 41.8 ± 2.5 ms (n = 10). These values are similar to those reported for I CRACin T lymphocytes and RBL cells (18.Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 19.Fierro L. Parekh A.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As such, this clearly differs from the response observed for I ARC described above (Fig. 2 A). This difference could not be explained by the absence of Ca2+ in the intracellular (pipette) solution used in the I SOC experiments as identical data were obtained if I SOC was activated by extracellular addition of the SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin (1 μm) using the standard pipette solution containing 100 nm Ca2+. The data obtained suggest thatI ARC and I SOC reflect the activity of entirely distinct channels. An additional common feature of store-operated Ca2+ entry pathways in a variety of different cell types is their marked sensitivity to changes in extracellular pH (pHo). Reducing pHo has been shown to inhibit capacitative Ca2+entry in several different cells (21.Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: G917-G924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G770-G778PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Wakabayashi I. Groschner K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24.Hug M.J. Pahl C. Novak I. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 432: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), including the m3-HEK cells (6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and to directly inhibit I CRAC in RBL cells (25.Malayev A. Nelson D.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have previously reported that the noncapacitative entry of Ca2+ activated by arachidonic acid is insensitive to decreases in extracellular pH (from 7.4 to 6.7) (6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To confirm that this sensitivity to pHo was demonstrated by the endogenous store-operated current (I SOC) of m3-HEK cells, we again examined the currents in cells in which the intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by using a Ca2+-free pipette solution. Under these conditions, changing pHo from 7.4 to 6.7 produced a rapid and pronounced inhibition (64.0 ± 9.9%,n = 5) of the store-operated current that was largely reversed on restoration of the normal pHo (recovery to 81.4 ± 6.3% of original current) (Fig.3, A and C). In marked contrast, reduction of the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.7 in cells exposed to arachidonic acid (8 μm) had only a small and slowly developing effect on the measuredI ARC (Fig. 3 B), amounting to a reduction of 22.8 ± 4.8% (n = 5) over 200 s (Fig. 3 C). The above data strongly suggest that the arachidonate-regulated current is entirely distinct from that activated by store depletion. This is consistent with our earlier report where the relative abilities of capacitative (thapsigargin-activated) and arachidonate-activated Ca2+ entry to stimulate a transfected Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase were used to discriminate between the two Ca2+ entry pathways (7.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Clearly, if capacitative and noncapacitative Ca2+ entry occurs through two entirely distinct membrane channels, it follows that the two currents should be additive. To examine this, we tested the effect of addition of arachidonic acid to cells in which the endogenous store-operated current (I SOC) had been activated by using a Ca2+-free pipette solution. As noted above, such treatment resulted in the activation of an inward current with a magnitude of approximately 0.5–0.6 pA/pF at −80 mV and which showed all the characteristics of a store-operated current. The subsequent addition of 8 μm arachidonic acid to such cells resulted in a further increase in the magnitude of the inward current measured at −80 mV to reach a maximum of approximately 1.0 pA/pF (Fig.4 A). This value is consistent with the two currents (I SOC andI ARC) being additive. To be certain that intracellular Ca2+ stores had been maximally depleted, thereby fully activating the endogenous store-operated Ca2+entry pathways, additional experiments were performed on cells that had been preincubated in thapsigargin (1 μm) for 15 min. Despite this maximal activation of capacitative pathways, subsequent addition of 8 μm arachidonic acid induced an additional inward current (7/11 cells), reflecting the activation ofI ARC (Fig. 4 B). The magnitude of the additional arachidonate-activated current (0.49 ± 0.06 pA/pF at −80 mV) was essentially identical to that previously seen forI ARC in the absence of thapsigargin pretreatment. Furthermore, subsequent addition of La3+ (50 μm) to the thapsigargin- and arachidonate-treated cells resulted in the overall current declining to a value significantly smaller than that observed before addition of arachidonic acid (Fig.4 B), suggesting that La3+ inhibits an additional Ca2+ current already activated by the thapsigargin treatment (presumably I SOC), i.e. the two currents, I SOC andI ARC, are additive. We conclude that low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid activate a novel Ca2+ current, I ARC, and that this current likely accounts for the receptor-activated, arachidonic acid-dependent, noncapacitative Ca2+ entry observed in these, and other, cells (5.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).I ARC shares some properties with the archetypal store-operated current I CRAC. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ both are small magnitude currents (∼0.5–1.0 pA/pF at −80 mV), with a high selectivity for Ca2+, and marked inward rectification. Upon removal of extracellular divalent ions, both ARC channels and CRAC channels exhibit a similar loss of selectivity, becoming permeable to monovalent ions. Despite these shared features there are some striking differences between I CRAC and I ARC.I ARC shows neither the fast inactivation, nor the marked sensitivity to extracellular pH that is characteristic ofI CRAC. Most importantly, the activation ofI ARC is observed even after maximal depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores, thereby demonstrating its noncapacitative nature. These data confirm our earlier proposal (7.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol.

In this earlier study we used the reported sensitivity of a transfected Ca2+-sensitive adenylyl cyclase to stimulation specifically by capacitative Ca2+entry. We showed that, while thapsigargin-activated Ca2+entry produced a profound increase in the cyclase activity in the transfected cells, the entry activated by arachidonic acid completely failed to do so thereby clearly discriminating between the two Ca2+ entry pathways (7.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In recent years much effort has been made to identify the molecular nature of the Ca2+ entry pathways of non-excitable cells. Particular attention has be paid to the so-called trp(transient receptor potential) gene from Drosophila that encodes a light-sensitive channel involved in phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ entry and that may be activated as a result of an inositol trisphosphate-induced emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores (26.Hardie R.C. Minke B Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although the characteristics of the endogenous TRP channels of insect photoreceptors are very different from I ARC (and indeed from vertebrate store-operated channels such asI CRAC), a recent report has shown that these TRP channels (along with the closely similar TRPL channels) are activated by certain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (27.Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Expression of mammalian homologues of the trp genes has been shown to lead to the development of a variety of different channel activities (28.Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). With regards to noncapacitative entry pathways, only two of these (TRP3 and TRP6), have components that are specifically activated by agonists and not by store depletion, with activation of TRP6 being exclusively independent of store depletion (29.Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30.Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A recent report has shown that both TRP6 and TRP3 can be activated by diacylglycerol (31.Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that these may represent members of a new class of nonstore-operated cation channels. However, expression of either TRP6 or TRP3 characteristically produces nonselective cation currents, with reversal potentials close to 0 mV and with large unitary conductances (29.Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30.Zhu X. Jiang M. Birnbaumer L. J.

Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). All of these features are inconsistent with the properties we have described forI ARC. Based on this, it seems unlikely that any of the currently known mammalian TRPs (including TRP6 or TRP3) represent the channel underlying I ARC. As to the physiological role of I ARC, it has previously been shown that the receptor-activated entry of Ca2+ during oscillations is entirely dependent on the generation of arachidonic acid (5.Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21720-21725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The demonstration of this in two very different cell types (exocrine cells from the avian nasal gland and in HEK293 cells), along with recent reports of an arachidonate-regulated entry of Ca2+ in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts and in smooth muscle cells (32.Munaron L. Antoiotti S. Distasi C. Lovisolo D. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33.Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar), indicates that this is a widespread phenomenon. Consistent with its noncapacitative nature, the critical role of this arachidonate-regulated entry is not associated with store refilling, but rather with the control of oscillation frequency (4.Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Indeed, as previously argued (3.Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the transient and/or partial nature of store depletion during oscillatory Ca2+ signals probably means that the requirement for store refilling in most cells is limited during such responses. These considerations lead us to conclude that arachidonate-regulated Ca2+ entry predominates during the oscillatory Ca2+ responses typical of physiologically relevant levels of stimulation. Given that cells are known to be particularly responsive to Ca2+ signals varying in the frequency domain and that oscillation frequency has been shown to selectively activate specific kinases, transcription factors, as well as mitochondrial metabolism in a frequency-dependent manner, it is clear that I ARC represents a Ca2+ entry pathway of critical physiological significance.

The N-terminal half of DnaE, followed by a 123-amino acid intein sequence, and the C-terminal half, preceded by a 36-amino acid intein sequence, are encoded by two open reading frames located more than 745 kilobases apart in the genome. When co-expressed in Escherichia coli, the two DnaE-intein fragments exhibited proteintrans-splicing (25.Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this report we have further investigated the cis- and trans-splicing activities of the Ssp DnaE intein in a foreign protein context. Furthermore, novel methods were developed that allow the on-column ligation of protein fragments as well as the in vivo and in vitro cyclization of proteins by intramolecular trans-splicing of the SspDnaE intein fragments.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrated that the Ssp DnaE intein was capable of splicing in a non-native protein context and determined that the intein fragments can self-associate with no more than 5 native extein residues. This implies that the interaction of the two intein halves in the natural condition is at least partly, or perhaps entirely, dominated by the association of the intein fragments and not by the extein residues. However, the presence of more extein residues may increase the efficiency of the splicing reaction and be vital to the effectiveness of this intein in the DnaE protein. Interestingly, the trans- and cis-splicing activities of theSsp DnaE intein were almost identical; this indicates that the N- and C-terminal domains of this intein have a high affinity interaction.Inteins represent a unique opportunity to perform protein manipulationsin vivo as well as in vitro. The present work has demonstrated the facile production of circular and possibly multimeric proteins in E. coli and opens up new avenues to produce stable, bioactive proteins and peptides in living cells. Also, a recent paper, published following completion of this manuscript, describes the in vivo cyclization of proteins using the Ssp DnaE intein, which they term the in vivo split intein-mediated circular ligation of peptide and proteins (SICLOPPS) (29.Scott C.P. Abel-Santos E. Wall M. Wahnon D.C. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13638-13643Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We propose that the term SICLOPPS be used in the future to describe the in vivo cyclization reaction.trans-Splicing allows the study of cyclic peptides and proteins in a cellular environment. Furthermore, the possibility of assembling multimeric proteins in vivo is a novel and potentially useful technology.The Ssp DnaE intein may be the intein of choice for in vitro trans-splicing experiments as it has been demonstrated to undergo the trans-splicing reaction without the need for a denaturation/renaturation step, as was necessary with other inteins (21.Yamazaki T. Otomo T. Oda N. Kyogoku Y. Uegaki K. Ito N. Ishino Y. Nakamura H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5591-5592Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23.Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S. Paulus H. Proc. Natl.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Also, the addition of the CBD to either the N- or C-terminal intein fragment had no detectable inhibitory effect on splicing. These unique properties allowed fusion proteins of both the intein N- and C-terminal fragments to be immobilized on a chitin resin for the subsequent ligation of two proteins under native conditions (Fig. 4 B). This represents a significant advantage over other intein-based protein fusion techniques because the spliced products are easily purified away from the column-bound reactants. Furthermore, association of the two halves of the Ssp DnaE intein permits trans-splicing to occur at relatively low concentrations of reactants.The present work demonstrated the use of inteins in both the in vivo and the in vitro manipulation of proteins. In particular, the Ssp DnaE intein represents an interesting and useful protein that trans-splices effectively in vivo with only minimal extein residue sequence and does not require cumbersome denaturation/renaturation steps for use in vitro. Future work should refine procedures to build and modify proteins in a cellular environment in much the same way as it is now possible to perform in vitro.

However, the presence of more extein residues may increase the efficiency of the splicing reaction and be vital to the effectiveness of this intein in the DnaE protein. Interestingly, the trans- and cis-splicing activities of theSsp DnaE intein were almost identical; this indicates that the N- and C-terminal domains of this intein have a high affinity interaction.Inteins represent a unique opportunity to perform protein manipulationsin vivo as well as in vitro. The present work has demonstrated the facile production of circular and possibly multimeric proteins in E. coli and opens up new avenues to produce stable, bioactive proteins and peptides in living cells. Also, a recent paper, published following completion of this manuscript, describes the in vivo cyclization of proteins using the Ssp DnaE intein, which they term the in vivo split intein-mediated circular ligation of peptide and proteins (SICLOPPS) (29.Scott C.P.

We propose that the term SICLOPPS be used in the future to describe the in vivo cyclization reaction.trans-Splicing allows the study of cyclic peptides and proteins in a cellular environment.

These unique properties allowed fusion proteins of both the intein N- and C-terminal fragments to be immobilized on a chitin resin for the subsequent ligation of two proteins under native conditions (Fig. 4 B). This represents a significant advantage over other intein-based protein fusion techniques because the spliced products are easily purified away from the column-bound reactants. Furthermore, association of the two halves of the Ssp DnaE intein permits trans-splicing to occur at relatively low concentrations of reactants.The present work demonstrated the use of inteins in both the in vivo and the in vitro manipulation of proteins. In particular, the Ssp DnaE intein represents an interesting and useful protein that trans-splices effectively in vivo with only minimal extein residue sequence and does not require cumbersome denaturation/renaturation steps for use in vitro. Future work should refine procedures to build and modify proteins in a cellular environment in much the same way as it is now possible to perform in vitro.

Here we used a membrane impermeable cross-linking agent to show a direct association between extracellular domains of α3β1 and CD151. The α3β1−CD151 association site was then mapped using chimeric α6/α3 integrins and CD151/NAG2 TM4SF proteins. Complex formation required an extracellular α3 site (amino acids (aa) 570–705) not previously known to be involved in specific integrin contacts with other proteins and a region (aa 186–217) within the large extracellular loop of CD151. Notably, the anti-CD151 monoclonal antibody TS151r binding epitope, previously implicated in α3 integrin association, was mapped to the same region of CD151 (aa 186–217). Finally, we demonstrated that both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of CD151 are located on the inside of the plasma membrane, thus confirming a long suspected model of TM4SF protein topology.

Integrins span the plasma membrane and link extracellular matrix proteins, as well as cellular ligands, to the cytoskeleton and associated signaling enzymes (1.Assoian R.K. J.

Electron microscopy studies suggest that integrin αβ heterodimers contain a large globular head (comprised of NH2-terminal domains) on two elongated stalks that may extend into the membrane (6.Carrell N.A.

Ligand and divalent cation binding sites have been largely mapped to the NH2-terminal (large globular head) regions of integrins (8.Loftus J.C. Smith J.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25235-25238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, integrin cytoplasmic tails have been suggested to associate with various intracellular molecules, including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperone proteins, and signaling enzymes (3.Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S91-S95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However at present, few if any direct interactions have been described for the extracellular membrane proximal “stalk-like” region of integrins. Particular integrins may engage in lateral interactions with a variety of other transmembrane proteins, including members of the transmembrane-4 superfamily (TM4SF proteins). The TM4SF proteins (also called tetraspannins) contain two extracellular loops (of 20–27 and 75–130 amino acids) and four putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The TM4SF proteins may play key roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation, fusion, development, motility, tumor cell growth, metastasis, and in vitro angiogenesis (10.Hemler M.E.

Various integrins, including α3β1, α6β1, α4β1, α2β1, α5β1, αLβ2, and αIIbβ3, may associate with one or more TM4SF proteins, including CD9, CD53, CD63, CD81, CD82, CD151, and NAG-2 (9.Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Besides integrins, TM4SF proteins also have been suggested to associate with each other (17.Imai T. Yoshie O. J.

Among this plethora of proposed interactions, little is known about which proteins directly associate with integrin subunits and which proteins are indirectly recruited into complexes with integrins. Many suggested integrin−TM4SF protein associations are based on co-immunoprecipitation results from cells lysed in detergents such as CHAPS,1 Brij 99, Brij 58, and octyl glucoside. However, in lysates prepared using detergents that are more hydrophobic (e.g. Brij 96, Triton X-100), integrin−TM4SF interactions appear to be much more restricted. For example, in 1% Triton X-100 cell lysates, α3β1 did not associate with any TM4SF protein except for CD151, and CD151 did not associate with any other integrin except α3β1 (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Also in contrast to other integrin−TM4SF associations, α3β1−CD151 association occurred at an unusually high stoichiometry (at least 90% of α3β1 was associated), was relatively resistant to the effects of denaturing detergents, and occurred in the apparent absence of any other cell surface proteins (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The α3β1−CD151 complex was also one of the few integrin−TM4SF protein complexes not disrupted by digitonin (29.Serru V. Naour F.L. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel CD151 epitope has been defined (using mAb TS151r) and shown to be quantitatively diminished following α3β1 overexpression (29.Serru V. Naour F.L. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The α3β1−CD151 complex may contribute to cell signaling and cell motility. For example, the CD151 protein serves to link α3β1 to the signaling molecule, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Also, antibodies to CD151 inhibited α3β1-dependent motility of neutrophils (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and antibodies to both CD151 and α3β1 similarly inhibited the motility of endothelial cells (30.Yánez-Mó M. Alfranca A. Cabañas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. De Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Possibly, α3β1−CD151−phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase complexes could serve as a functional unit to support cell migration. Here we have investigated the biochemical basis for α3β1−CD151 complex formation. We provide evidence that the association between CD151 and α3β1 is direct and may involve a site in the extracellular “stalk” region of α3, interacting with a site within the large extracellular loop of CD151. Also, we have provided perhaps the first experimental demonstration that the NH2 and COOH termini of a TM4SF protein (in this case CD151) are indeed located intracellularly. HT1080, A431, and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium EM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. K562 cells transfected with full-length, wild-type α3 (K562-α3WT) and α6(K562-α6WT) subunits were described previously (31.Weitzman J.B. Pasqualini R. Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Biol.

Desaymard C. Scharff M.D. Hybridoma. 1981; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and J2A2 (39.Hemler M.E. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2734-2738PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, mAb 5C11 was used for all CD151 immunoprecipitations, and mAb 11B1 was used for all CD151 immunoblots. Polyclonal antibodies against caveolin (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), the hemagglutinin “HA” tag (Berkelely Antibody Company), and the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α3A (40.Dipersio C.M. Shah S. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2321-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also utilized in this study. Rabbit polyclonal anti-CD151 antisera was raised against a 15-amino acid peptide (MGEFNEKKATSGTVC) very similar to the amino-terminal sequence of mouse and human CD151. The peptide was coupled to carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester (Pierce) as described previously (41.Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A rabbit was immunized four times at 2-week intervals and then serum was collected, purified on a column of peptide conjugated to Thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and concentrated to 1.4 mg/ml. Preimmune serum was purified using protein A-Sepharose. Cell lines were lysed for 1 h in immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100 detergent, unless otherwise indicated. Insoluble material was cleared from lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. To eliminate nonspecific binding material, lysates were then incubated for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or protein A-Sepharose alone, or prebound with 187.1 antibody. For immunoprecipitation lysates were incubated with specific antibodies prebound to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for either 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. In some cases, anti-CD81 or anti-CD151 monoclonal antibodies directly conjugated to CnBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used. Immune complexes were washed four times in the appropriate lysis buffer and solubilized in either nonreducing or reducing (100 mm dithiothreitol) sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. For analysis of surface epitopes by immunoprecipitation, COS7 transfectants were harvested, washed two times in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% sodium azide (assay buffer), and the respective antibodies were added in assay buffer. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times, and cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100. Lysates were clarified as above and immune complexes were captured by addition of protein A-Sepharose (for rabbit polyclonals) or protein G-Sepharose (for monoclonals). Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% dry milk. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBST, and incubated an additional hour with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma). After extensive washing with PBST, proteins were visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent (NEN Life Science Products). In some cases, blots were probed with biotinylated antibodies and subsequently incubated with extravidin-peroxidase (Sigma) in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin before chemiluminescent detection. To increase the signal in Fig. 5 B, blots were developed using enzyme substrates (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium, Sigma) after probing blots with a tertiary antibody (rabbit anti-goat IgG-AP conjugate). Chimeric integrin α chains were produced by the overlapping oligonucleotide PCR technique. Integrin chimera α6/α3-V was produced using the following internal oligonucleotides: sense, CCCATTCCCATCATCATCTCCATGAAC and antisense, ATGATGATGGGAATGGGACGCAG. This swap (α6 … KLRPIPI/IISMN … α3) connects α6 residue 580 with α3 residue 569. Integrin chimera α6/α3-VI was produced using internal oligonucleotides: sense, GACTGTGAGCTGGGGAACCCCTTC and antisense, TTCCCCAGCTCACAGTCAGCTTGC. This swap (α6 … QADCEL/GNPFKR … α3) connects α6 residue 746 with α3 residue 705. Integrin chimera α6/α3-VIII was produced using the following internal oligonucleotides: sense, TTATGGAACAGCACCTTCATCG and antisense, AAGGTGCTGTTCCATAACCTCG. This swap (α6 … ILRSRL/WNSTFI … α3) connects α6 residue 956 with α3 residue 934. Chimeras were extended to include theBstBI restriction site in the wild-type α6sequence and the 3′ end of wild-type α3 sequence and were subcloned into pBluescript KS. The entire PCR regions of the chimeric constructs were sequenced to confirm fidelity. Chimeric cDNA was subsequently cloned into the expression plasmid pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and stably transfected into K562 cells via electroporation at 960 microfarads and 280 V using a gene pulser. Transfectants were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subcloned by limiting dilution. Positive subclones stably expressing chimeric integrin subunits were assessed by Western blotting, using a polyclonal antibody specific for the cytoplasmic domain of α3. For transient transfection, 10 × 106 K562 cells were electroporated with 50 μg of plasmid DNA at 960 microfarads and 320 V as described previously (42.McCaffrey P.G. Newsome D.A. Fibach E. Yoshida M. Su M.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 2075-2083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were analyzed within 36–48 h. 45 to 65% of K562 cells became transfected, as estimated using a green fluorescent protein-containing vector. Wild-type CD151 (43.Hasegawa H.

CD151-HA was amplified using the following primers: sense, GACTAGTCATGGGTGAGTTCAACGAG and antisense, GGAATTCCTCAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGGCGTAGTGCTCCAGCTTGAG. NAG2-HA was amplified using the following primers: sense, GACTAGTCGACCCTGAGCACCGCCTG and antisense, GGAATTCCTCAGGCGTAGTCGGGCACGTCGTAGGGGTAGGCCGCGCAGTAGGTGTCTG. Amplified products were ligated into SpeI and EcoRI restriction sites in the expression plasmid, pZeoSV (Invitrogen), and confirmed by sequencing. Chimeric proteins were produced by recombinant PCR using internal primers as follows: mutant C(104)-N, GATGGTGGCCTCCAGCAGAAAGATGATGAG (antisense to amplify 5′ region on CD151-HA template) and CTCATCATCTTTCTGCTGGAGGCCACCATC (sense to amplify 3′ region on NAG2-HA template); mutant N-C(105), AGCGATGATCTCCAGCAGGAACACCAGCAG (antisense to amplify of 5′ region on NAG2-HA template) and CTGCTGGTGTTCCTGCTGGAGATCATCGCT (sense to amplify 3′ region on CD151-HA); mutant C(185)-N, CTGAACTCCAAGCAGCAGCTGTCTGGGAC (antisense to amplify 5′ region on CD151-HA template) and GTCCCAGACAGCTGCTGCTTGGAGTTCAG (sense to amplify 3′ region on NAG-2-HA template); mutant (217)-N, CAGCCAGCAGGTTCTCCTGGATGAAGGTC (antisense to amplify 5′ region on CD151-HA template) and GACCTTCATCCAGGAGAACCTGCTGGCTG (sense to amplify 3′ region on NAG-2-HA template); mutant C(185)-N-C(218), CCTCAGGTGCTCCTGCTGAAGCCACAC (antisense to amplify 5′ region on C(185)-N template) and GTGTGGCTTCAGGAGCACCTGAGG (sense to amplify 3′ region on CD151-HA template). Recombinant PCR was carried out using purified PCR products with T3 and SP6 external primers (encoded by pZeoSV). Products were ligated into the expression plasmid, pZeoSV, and confirmed by sequencing. The swap sites correspond to regions shared by both CD151 and NAG-2. The “FLLE” site (chimeras C(104)-N and N-C(105)) is within the third transmembrane domain, and “VPDS” (C(185)-N)) and “QE” (C(217)-N) sites are both in the COOH-terminal part of the large extracellular loop. HA-tagged proteins were transiently transfected into HT1080 cells using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and analyzed for association with integrin 24 h after transfection. In addition, COS7 cells were stably transfected with vector alone, CD151-HA or wild-type CD151 without an HA tag using Superfect, and selected with 100–200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies in PBS, 10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide (assay buffer) at 4 °C for approximately 1 h. Cells were then washed and incubated an additional hour with a secondary, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Calbiochem) in assay buffer. After additional washes, cells were analyzed using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. For permeabilization experiments, both primary and secondary antibody incubations were carried out in the presence or absence of 0.5% saponin. COS7 cell transfectants were grown overnight on acid-washed coverslips, washed in warm PBS, and fixed in fresh, 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were either left nonpermeabilized or were permeabilized for 4 min with 0.5% Triton X-100, prior to blocking coverslips for 45 min at 37 °C with PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum. Cells were stained with primary antibodies in 10% goat serum for 1.5 h, washed extensively and stained with secondary, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Calbiochem) or fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) for 1 h. Coverslips were washed and mounted using ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). It was shown previously that association of CD151 with the integrin α3β1 is highly stoichiometric, stable, and specific. To determine whether these proteins might be directly associated, we carried out chemical cross-linking of intact HT1080 cells, using a membrane-impermeable reagent (DTSSP (3′,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate)) with a 12-Å spacer arm. Initially, anti-α3, anti-CD151, or control immunoprecipitations were carried out and then complexes were disrupted by treatment with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, and 0.5% SDS. Finally, from the resolubilized material, CD151 was re-immunoprecipitated. As expected from uncross-linked cells, CD151 was isolated from complexes originally immunoprecipitated using anti-α3 or CD151 antibodies (Fig.1, lanes c and d). However, no integrin α3 subunit remained associated with the CD151. In contrast, from cells treated with DTSSP, re-isolated CD151 remained in association with the integrin α3subunit (lanes g and h). Thus, cross-linking stabilized α3β1 association with CD151 and made it resistant to harsh, dissociating conditions. In negative control experiments (using anti-α2 or no primary antibody), we failed to re-immunoprecipitate CD151 or α3 integrin (Fig. 1, lanes a, b,e, and f) even though α2 is highly expressed on HT1080 cells (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In another control experiment, we immunoprecipitated CD81 from DTSSP-cross-linked cells lysed under stringent detergent conditions (1% Triton X-100), but we failed to co-immunoprecipitate β1 integrin (data not shown). However, under the same conditions, we readily co-immunoprecipitated β1 integrin with CD151 (not shown). Recent evidence has suggested that caveolin-1 could co-immunoprecipitate with integrins, including α3β1, in Triton X-100 cell lysates (46.Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar,47.Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Since the majority of α3β1 is associated with CD151 in 1% Triton X-100 lysates (28.Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we considered that caveolin-1 may also be present in α3β1−CD151 complexes. Caveolin-1 was clearly present in the lysates of A431 cells (lane a). However upon immunoprecipitation of either α3β1 or CD151 from A431 cells, we failed to observe co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 (Fig.2, lower panel, lanes c and h). Under the same conditions, we did readily observe β1 integrin co-immunoprecipitated with CD151 (upper panel, lane h). Also, caveolin-1 was not co-immunoprecipitated with the integrins α2β1 and α6β1(lower panel, lanes c and e) and was not obtained using antibodies to TM4SF proteins, CD9 and CD81 (lanes f and g) or control IgG (lane b). In a separate experiment, we failed to detect caveolin in association with CD151 or integrins in 1% Triton X-100 lysates from HT1080 cells (data not shown). Together these data suggest a direct association between α3β1 and CD151 that is independent of caveolin. To determine which α3 extracellular domains are needed for CD151 association, we produced chimeric proteins in which extracellular regions of α3 were swapped with regions from α6, a structurally similar integrin subunit (Fig.3). Chimeric and wild-type integrins were stably transfected into K562 cells, and multiple subclones of each chimeric integrin transfectant were tested for capability to co-immunoprecipitate with CD151. Under reducing conditions, the precursor form of wild-type and chimeric α3 (not yet cleaved into heavy and light chains) was consistently detected in K562 cell lysates (Fig. 4 A). Also, precursor α3 was detected in CD151 immunoprecipitates from wild-type α3 transfected cells, as well as from each of the three α6/α3-V chimeric integrin subclones tested. However, we failed to detect α3precursor in CD151 immunoprecipitates from any of the α6/α3-VIII subclones, even though precursor α3 was present in the lysates from those subclones. In control experiments, we failed to detect any α3 precursor from K562 cells transfected with vector alone or with wild-type α6 (Fig. 4 A). Likewise, we did not detect α3 in CD81 immunoprecipitates from any K562 transfectant (Fig. 4 A). As indicated in Fig. 4 B, both CD151 (lower panel) and CD81 (upper panel) were expressed strongly and comparably in each K562 transfectant, as detected by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting.Figure 4Association of stably transfected α3 chimeras with CD151. A,K562 cells stably transfected with either vector alone, wild-type α3, wild-type α6, or three separate subclones each of α6/α3-VIII and α6/α3-V chimeras were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies to CD81 or CD151. Immune complexes or whole lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal antibody to the α3A cytoplasmic tail. Chimeric and wild-type α subunits showed variable extents of maturation, but consistently high levels of precursor α3 (∼160,00 kDa). Thus we chose to analyze precursor α3(α3 pre), instead of the mature, cleaved light chain that was analyzed in Figs. 1, 5, and 7 B. B, immune complexes prepared using anti-CD151 (5C11) or anti-CD81 antibodies were blotted with antibody to CD81 (upper panel) and CD151 (11B1, lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In another experiment, we utilized transiently transfected K562 cells and again observed that CD151 immunoprecipitation yielded wild-type α3 and α6/α3-V chimera (Fig.5, middle panel, lanes b and d). In contrast to Fig. 4 A, we now observed that both mature (α3L) and immature (α3pre) forms of the wild-type and chimeric integrin were associated with CD151. Notably, CD151 failed to associate with α6WT or the α6/α3-VI or α6/α3-VIII chimeras (Fig. 5, middle panel, lanes c, e, and f). As also indicated in Fig. 5, α3WT and chimeric proteins were all well represented in total cell lysates (upper panel,lanes b and d–f), al"

However, the ligand specificity and the nature of the ligands on OxLDL that mediate the binding to CD36 remain ill defined. Results from recent studies suggested that some of the macrophage scavenger receptors involved in the uptake of OxLDL recognized both the lipid and the protein moieties of OxLDL, but there was no conclusive direct evidence for this. The present studies were undertaken to test whether a single, well characterized OxLDL receptor, CD36, could bind both the lipid and protein moieties of OxLDL. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with mouse CD36 cDNA bound intact OxLDL with high affinity. This binding was very effectively inhibited (∼50%) both by the reconstituted apoB from OxLDL and by microemulsions prepared from OxLDL lipids. The specific binding of both moieties to CD36 was further confirmed by direct ligand binding analysis and by demonstrating reciprocal inhibition, i.e. apoB from OxLDL inhibited the binding of the OxLDL lipids and vice versa. Furthermore, a monoclonal mouse antibody that recognizes oxidation-specific epitopes in OxLDL inhibited the binding of intact OxLDL and also that of its purified protein and lipid moieties to CD36. This antibody recognizes the phospholipid 1-palmitoyl 2-(5′-oxovaleroyl) phosphatidylcholine. This model of an oxidized phospholipid was also an effective competitor for the CD36 binding of both the resolubilized apoB and the lipid microemulsions from OxLDL. Our results demonstrate that oxidized phospholipids in the lipid phase or covalently attached to apoB serve as ligands for recognition by CD36 and, at least in part, mediate the high affinity binding of OxLDL to macrophages.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). OxLDL interacts with macrophages via scavenger receptors, a family of receptors characterized by broad ligand binding specificity. Macrophages express a number of scavenger receptors that bind OxLDL, including SRA-1, SRA-2, SRA-3, MARCO, CD36, SR-B1, CD68/macrosialin, and LOX-1 (3.Krieger M. Curr. Opin.

Initially, it was assumed that modifications of the protein structure were centrally important because LDL could be converted to a high affinity ligand for macrophage scavenger receptors by conjugating it with acetic anhydride or with malondialdehyde or other reagents known to react with amino groups of proteins (7.Goldstein J.L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2214-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was directly demonstrated that the apoB isolated from OxLDL after exhaustive extraction of the lipids could bind in a specific fashion to macrophages and compete for the binding of intact OxLDL to these macrophages (9.Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Otero D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the possible binding of lipid moieties was not tested in those experiments, and recent studies have demonstrated that indeed both the lipid and the protein moieties of OxLDL can mediate the binding of intact OxLDL to macrophages (10.Bird D.A. Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Products derived by oxidation of pure phospholipids (e.g. 1-palmitoyl 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine) have also been shown to inhibit the binding of intact OxLDL (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and also that of isolated apoB and microemulsions of OxLDL lipids (10.Bird D.A. Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Friedman P.

Finally, a mouse monoclonal antibody (EO6), selected on the basis of its recognition of OxLDL and specifically of the oxidized phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl 2-(5′-oxovaleroyl) phosphatidylcholine (POVPC), reacts with both the isolated apoprotein of OxLDL and with the lipids from OxLDL, but not with native apoB nor with lipids derived from native LDL (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin.

This antibody strongly inhibits the macrophage binding and degradation of intact OxLDL, as well as that of apoB and lipids derived from OxLDL, presumably by masking the epitopes of OxLDL that are recognized by the scavenger receptors.Most of the studies summarized above were done by measuring binding to intact mouse peritoneal macrophages and did not identify which of the several scavenger receptors on the macrophage were involved. For a number of reasons, it seemed possible that at least some of the receptors involved were individually binding both the lipid moiety and the modified protein moiety, but that could not be concluded with any certainty. Therefore, we have undertaken to explore the ligand binding specificity of individual scavenger receptors.Recent studies provided direct evidence that CD36 is an important physiological receptor involved in the uptake of OxLDL by macrophages and may, therefore, play a role in foam cell formation in vivo. Macrophages from subjects with CD36 deficiency are less efficient in binding and uptake of OxLDL compared with macrophages from normal controls (13.Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyama Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J.I. Kameda-Takemura K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Macrophages isolated from CD36-deficient mice show a similar reduction in OxLDL binding and uptake (14.Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role in macrophage function.This report deals with the ligand binding specificity of CD36. It has been established that cells transfected with CD36 show a large increase in binding of intact OxLDL compared with nontransfected control cells (15.Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported below show that CD36, which is transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, exhibits ligand binding characteristics similar to those reported for intact macrophages, i.e. it can directly bind either apoB or the reconstituted lipids derived from OxLDL. Cross-competition experiments suggest that the same oxidation-specific epitope mediating the binding of OxLDL to CD36 is present in both fractions. As in the case of intact macrophages, monoclonal antibody EO6 inhibited the binding of OxLDL to CD36. Moreover, a well characterized synthetic oxidized phospholipid POVPC, the epitope of EO6 found in OxLDL (16.Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and previously shown to prevent the binding of OxLDL to macrophages (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), also inhibited very effectively the binding of OxLDL to CD36-transfected cells.DISCUSSIONThe data presented show conclusively that a single receptor, CD36, can bind both a ligand or ligands associated with the lipid moiety of OxLDL and also a ligand or ligands associated with the delipidated apoprotein B from OxLDL. Other investigators have suggested that CD36 recognition of OxLDL might depend primarily on the lipid moiety because they found no difference, or very little difference, in the binding of the isolated apoprotein to CD36-transfected cells and mock-transfected cells (27.Nicholson A.C. Frieda S. Pearce A. Silverstein R.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, in those studies, the binding of the lipid moiety was not directly tested. The pattern of our results using CD36-transfected cells qualitatively matches that of our previous results using resident mouse peritoneal macrophages, where several different scavenger receptors are undoubtedly involved (10.Bird D.A. Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The concordance of those results with the present results suggests that CD36 is a major contributor to macrophage binding of OxLDL or that other scavenger receptors also can bind the lipid and protein moieties of OxLDL.Several receptor segments of CD36 have been implicated in the binding of intact OxLDL (28.Puente Navazo M.D. Daviet L. Ninio E. McGregor J.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Pearce S.F. Roy P. Nicholson A.C. Hajjar D.P. Febbraio M. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34875-34881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fact that the isolated apoprotein and the reconstituted lipids showed a highly significant degree of reciprocal competition indicates that at least part of the binding is to a common region of the receptor. However, the competition was incomplete, and some portion of the binding may well be to different sites on the receptor. CD36 binds a number of different ligands, and there is reason to believe that it functions differently in respect to these ligands, suggesting that different segments are involved in ligand binding. For example, the binding of thrombospondin depends upon an interaction between CD36 and the vitronectin receptor αvβ3 (30.Savill J. Hogg N. Ren Y. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In platelets, the binding of thrombospondin is further controlled by the phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of a CD36 ectodomain switches the ligand specificity and decreases thrombospondin binding, with a reciprocal increase in platelet binding to collagen (31.Asch A.S. Liu I. Briccetti F.M. Barnwell J.W. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).At first glance, it seems paradoxical that the apoprotein moiety and the lipid moieties would bind to the same site on a receptor. The probable explanation is that some fraction of oxidized phospholipids becomes covalently bonded to the apoprotein during the oxidation of LDL and remains associated with it despite exhaustive extraction of the noncovalently bound lipids. Indirect evidence for this was presented in our previous studies showing that a monoclonal antibody against oxidized phospholipids (EO6) reacted not only with intact OxLDL but also with the separated apoprotein and lipid moieties (11.Hörkkö S.

Moreover, current studies in this laboratory 2K. L. Gillotte, S. Hörkkö, J. L. Witztum, and D. Steinberg, unpublished data. show directly that during oxidation of LDL, there is a progressive increase in the amount of phosphorus covalently linked to apoB, reaching a maximum of about 70 mol per mol of protein.What is the precise nature of the lipid ligand or ligands involved and how many different ligands are there on OxLDL? It seems likely that the heterogeneous mixture of oxidized products formed during LDL oxidation includes several different molecules that can be involved in receptor recognition. However, there is now evidence that oxidized phospholipids play a major role in the binding of OxLDL to CD36. In previous studies, we have shown that the monoclonal antibody EO6 can inhibit the binding of intact OxLDL by as much as 90%, implying that oxidized phospholipids recognized by this antibody account for much of the binding of OxLDL to macrophage scavenger receptors (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the present study, this monoclonal antibody was able to substantially inhibit the CD36 binding of intact OxLDL (70%), of the isolated oxidized lipid fraction (85%), and, to a lesser degree, of apoB from OxLDL (35%). The monoclonal antibody EO6 was cloned from spleens of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (26.Palinski W. Hörkkö S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P. Powell H.C. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 800-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and specifically recognizes oxidized phospholipids, including POVPC, when presented either as pure lipid or as lipid-protein adduct (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). POVPC is an oxidation product of 1-palmitoyl 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine and is thought to be one of the biologically active components of minimally modified LDL (16.Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). POVPC competed for the binding of OxLDL and its isolated fractions to a degree that was similar to that exhibited by EO6. Taken together, these binding data suggest that more than 50% of the binding of OxLDL to CD36 is mediated by oxidized phospholipids, present either in the lipid phase or covalently attached to the apoprotein. It should be stressed that the studies reported here deal exclusively with the binding of ligands to CD36. However, other studies have demonstrated that CD36 fulfills many of the criteria for classification as a scavenger receptor contributing to uptake and degradation of OxLDL (13.Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H.

Although their relative importance in macrophage function is difficult to estimate given the redundancy that is built into an essential biological system, such as host defense, CD36 appears to play a prominent role in OxLDL uptake by macrophages and possibly foam cell formation. Consistent with an important function, CD36 expression was up-regulated in an autocrine or paracrine fashion when macrophages were exposed to OxLDL (37.Yoshida H. Quehenberger O. Kondratenko N.

A common characteristic of apoptotic cells is the cell surface expression of molecules that are not found on normal cells and that are recognized by scavenger receptors. Although the molecular structures of apoptotic cells that mediate the interaction remain ill-defined, recent studies suggested that they might be similar to some of the epitopes found on OxLDL (41.Sambrano G.R. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3265-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), including oxidized phospholipids, such as POVPC (42.Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). CD36 appears to be directly involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells (43.Ren Y. Silverstein R.L. Savill J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and future experiments in this laboratory will be aimed at the analysis of molecular structures that mediate their recognition by CD36. The oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 and the subsequent uptake of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) by macrophages, leading to foam cell formation, is an important pathway in atherogenesis (1.Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). OxLDL interacts with macrophages via scavenger receptors, a family of receptors characterized by broad ligand binding specificity. Macrophages express a number of scavenger receptors that bind OxLDL, including SRA-1, SRA-2, SRA-3, MARCO, CD36, SR-B1, CD68/macrosialin, and LOX-1 (3.Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4.Yamada Y. Doi T. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. Cell Mol.

Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The nature of the ligand(s) on OxLDL recognized by these receptors has not been clearly defined. Initially, it was assumed that modifications of the protein structure were centrally important because LDL could be converted to a high affinity ligand for macrophage scavenger receptors by conjugating it with acetic anhydride or with malondialdehyde or other reagents known to react with amino groups of proteins (7.Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar, 8.Fogelman A.M. Shechter I. Seager J. Hokom M. Child J.S. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2214-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was directly demonstrated that the apoB isolated from OxLDL after exhaustive extraction of the lipids could bind in a specific fashion to macrophages and compete for the binding of intact OxLDL to these macrophages (9.Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Otero D. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the possible binding of lipid moieties was not tested in those experiments, and recent studies have demonstrated that indeed both the lipid and the protein moieties of OxLDL can mediate the binding of intact OxLDL to macrophages (10.Bird D.A. Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Products derived by oxidation of pure phospholipids (e.g. 1-palmitoyl 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine) have also been shown to inhibit the binding of intact OxLDL (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and also that of isolated apoB and microemulsions of OxLDL lipids (10.Bird D.A. Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Friedman P.

Finally, a mouse monoclonal antibody (EO6), selected on the basis of its recognition of OxLDL and specifically of the oxidized phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl 2-(5′-oxovaleroyl) phosphatidylcholine (POVPC), reacts with both the isolated apoprotein of OxLDL and with the lipids from OxLDL, but not with native apoB nor with lipids derived from native LDL (11.Hörkkö S. Bird D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin.

This antibody strongly inhibits the macrophage binding and degradation of intact OxLDL, as well as that of apoB and lipids derived from OxLDL, presumably by masking the epitopes of OxLDL that are recognized by the scavenger receptors. Most of the studies summarized above were done by measuring binding to intact mouse peritoneal macrophages and did not identify which of the several scavenger receptors on the macrophage were involved. For a number of reasons, it seemed possible that at least some of the receptors involved were individually binding both the lipid moiety and the modified protein moiety, but that could not be concluded with any certainty. Therefore, we have undertaken to explore the ligand binding specificity of individual scavenger receptors. Recent studies provided direct evidence that CD36 is an important physiological receptor involved in the uptake of OxLDL by macrophages and may, therefore, play a role in foam cell formation in vivo. Macrophages from subjects with CD36 deficiency are less efficient in binding and uptake of OxLDL compared with macrophages from normal controls (13.Nozaki S. Kashiwagi H. Yamashita S. Nakagawa T. Kostner B. Tomiyama Y. Nakata A. Ishigami M. Miyagawa J.I. Kameda-Takemura K. Kurata Y. Matsuzawa Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Macrophages isolated from CD36-deficient mice show a similar reduction in OxLDL binding and uptake (14.Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol.

This report deals with the ligand binding specificity of CD36. It has been established that cells transfected with CD36 show a large increase in binding of intact OxLDL compared with nontransfected control cells (15.Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S.

In all cell systems studied, GnRH-induced phospholipase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization was pertussis toxin-insensitive, as was GnRH-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Whereas the Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic receptor interacted with a chimeric Gs protein (Gsi5) containing the C-terminal five amino acids of Gαi2, the human GnRH receptor was unable to activate the G protein chimera. GnRH challenge of αT3–1, CHO#3 and of GnRH receptor-expressing COS-7 cells did not result in agonist-dependent cAMP formation. GnRH challenge of CHO#3 cells expressing a cAMP-responsive element-driven firefly luciferase did not result in increased reporter gene expression.

In αT3–1 and CHO#3 cell membranes, addition of [α-32P]GTP azidoanilide resulted in GnRH receptor-dependent labeling of Gαq/11 but not of Gαi, Gαs or Gα12/13proteins. Thus, the murine and human GnRH receptors exclusively couple to G proteins of the Gq/11 family.

GnRH is synthesized in the hypothalamus and released into the hypophyseal portal circulation in a pulsatile fashion to interact with a membranous receptor on gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland (1.Hotchkiss J. Knobil E. Raven Press, New York. 1994; 2: 711-750Google Scholar). In these cells, the synthesis and the secretion of gonadotropins is subject to differential regulation by GnRH (2.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the neuropeptide is additionally involved in the long term maintenance of the gonadotrope phenotype (3.Childs G.V. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 50: 215-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cloning of cDNAs coding for GnRH receptors of various species demonstrated that GnRH interacts with a membrane receptor belonging to the large superfamily of heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (2.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4.Flanagan C.A. Millar R.P. Illing N. Rev. Reprod. 1997; 2: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Apart from the effects of GnRH on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, extrapituitary actions in the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as in several extraneural and also in neoplastic tissues have been described (5.Stojilkovic S.S. Reinhart J. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 462-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Current evidence is consistent with the notion of an autocrine/paracrine regulatory GnRH system exerting a growth regulatory effect on various cell types (6.Emons G. Muller V. Ortmann O. Schulz K.D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 65: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In a number of human malignancies, such as breast, ovary, endometrium, and prostate cancers, the expression of GnRH and its receptor, as well as a direct antiproliferative effect of GnRH analogues, could be demonstrated (7.Pinski J. Reile H. Halmos G. Groot K. Schally A.V. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8.Irmer G. Bürger C. Müller R. Ortmann O. Peter U. Kakar S.S. Neill J.D. Schulz K.D. Emons G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 817-822PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Kakar S.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4558-4560PubMed Google Scholar). Most notably, the nucleotide sequence of the GnRH receptor in breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer cells is identical to that expressed in the pituitary gland (10.Kakar S.S. Grizzle W.E. Neill J.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In vivo studies with nude mice strongly suggest that the antitumor activity of a GnRH receptor antagonist is not only exerted through suppression of the pituitary-gonadal axis but also through a direct effect of the GnRH analogue on tumor cells (11.Yano T. Pinski J. Halmos G. Szepeshazi K. Groot K. Schally A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Considering the plethora of cellular effects elicited by GnRH, one may ask where whithin the neuropeptide-induced signal transduction cascade divergent pathways are engaged. One potential answer would be to postulate an inherent ability of the GnRH receptor to couple to multiple G proteins, which would then enable the receptor to activate multiple signal transduction pathways (2.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This view, however, is not uncontested, and despite the deluge of circumstantial evidence, direct proof of the activation of multiple G proteins by the agonist-bound GnRH receptor is still missing.To better understand the cellular actions of GnRH and its analogues, we set out to study the G protein coupling profile of the murine GnRH receptor, endogenously expressed in αT3–1 cells, and of the human receptor expressed in CHO and COS-7 cells. We provide direct evidence that the GnRH receptor in its native environment exclusively couples to Gq/11 proteins. Therefore, divergent GnRH-induced signal transduction is determined downstream of the receptor/G protein interface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma with the following exceptions: buserelin was purchased from Welding, and the ECL system and myo-[3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Incubations were carried out for 90 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled buserelin (10−6m). Bound and free ligand were separated by filtration on Whatman GF/C filters using an Amicon 10-fold sampling device. Filters were presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine for 30 min in order to reduce nonspecific binding. The filters were washed twice with 5 ml 0.02 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Bound radioactivity was determined with a γ-counter. Binding data were analyzed with the help of the computer program LIGAND (17.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar).Measurement of Intracellular Inositol Phosphate and cAMP AccumulationFor cAMP and inositol phosphate (IP) measurements, cells were seeded into 12-well plates (3 × 105cells/well for αT3–1 and CHO#3 cells; 2 × 105cells/well for COS-7 cells) 3 days prior to functional assays. For cAMP determinations, cells were washed once in serum-free DMEM, followed by a 20-min preincubation with the same medium containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with appropriate concentrations of agonist or antagonist for 1 h. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml 5% trichloroacetic acid. The cAMP content of the cell extracts was determined as described previously (15.Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For IP determinations, cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml ofmyo-[3H]inositol for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM containing 10 mm LiCl. Agonist-induced increases in intracellular IP levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography.Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+MobilizationDetermination of [Ca2+]i was performed after loading of cells with 5 μm fura-2/AM as described previously (18.Herrlich A. Kühn B. Grosse R. Schmid A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16764-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, semiconfluent grown cells were detached and incubated (2 × 107 cells/ml) in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmNaHCO3, 5, 5 mm glucose, 10 mmHEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 5 μm fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted and resuspended at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml in incubation buffer in 2-ml aliquots at room temperature in the dark until used. To obtain R max andR min, Triton X-100 (reduced form, Sigma; final concentration, 0.1%) and EGTA (pH 8.5; final concentration, 20 mm) were added sequentially to the cell suspensions. Autofluorescence was recorded in the presence of 20 mmMnCl2. Concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ was calculated according to Grynkiewicz et al. (19.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).cAMP Response Element-dependent Luciferase AssaysFor luciferase assays CHO cells permanently expressing the human GnRH receptor (CHO#3) or the human V2 receptor (CHO-V2-R) were transiently transfected with the plasmid pADneo2-C6-BGL containing six heterologous cAMP-responsive element sequences. Two days later, cells were stimulated for 5 h with 20 μm forskolin, 1 μm GnRH, or 100 nm arginine-vasopressin (AVP). After removal of the incubation medium, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in assay buffer containing ATP and 1% Triton X-100. After luciferin addition the luciferase activity was measured in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold).ERK Activity AssaysFor ERK mobility shift assays, αT3–1 cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were grown to confluence in six-well dishes, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 16 h in the absence or presence of PTX (0.1 μg/ml). Thereafter, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline again and treated for 10 min with various compounds (see figure legend) dissolved in DMEM. After an additional washing step with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed on ice in SDS sample buffer (pH 6.8). Lysates were sonicated and boiled for 3 min. Forty μl of these lysates were used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamid gels run at 10 mA overnight. ERK2 was detected with anti-ERK2 antibodies by immunoblotting.For immune complex kinase assays, endogenously expressed ERK was immunoprecipitated with ERK2 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose from αT3–1 cells grown to semiconfluence in 100-mm dishes. Immune complexes were washed three times with kinase buffer (40 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA and 200 μmNa3VO4), and reactions were performed with 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma). The kinase assay was started in the presence of 50 μm ATP solution containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 20 min and were terminated by the addition of 88% formic acid. Reaction mixtures were then spotted onto Whatman p81 chromatography paper and washed four times in 150 mm phosphoric acid. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. All assays were performed in duplicate. Basal cpm values in independent experiments ranged between 1500 and 7000 cpm, whereas probes without ERK2 antibody were below 150 cpm.Photolabeling of Receptor-activated G ProteinsPhotolabeling of membrane G proteins and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (20.Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermans S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The following antisera were used: AS 348 (αs), AS 370 (αq/11), AS 233 (α12), AS 343 (α13), AS 266 (αi common), and AS 6 (αo common). Antisera were raised against peptides corresponding to specific regions of G protein α subunits and have been described before (20.Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermans S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21.Allgeier A. Offermanns S. Van Sande J. Spicher K. Schultz G. Dumont J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13733-13735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated G protein α subunits were separated on 13% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography of dried gels with Kodak X-Omat AR-5 films (Eastman Kodak Co.) or with a phosphoimaging screen.DISCUSSIONIn the gonadotrope, GnRH elicits several distinct physiological responses via activation of a single class of membrane receptors (2.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One possibility to explain the engagement of parallel signal transduction pathways at the molecular level is the activation of several G proteins by a single agonist-occupied receptor (33.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Along these lines, the proposal has recently been put forward that apart from interacting with Gq/11 proteins (34.Hsieh K.-P. Martin T.F.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GnRH receptor would also activate Gi and Gs proteins (12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, the propensity of the GnRH receptor to couple to multiple G proteins was inferred not to be gonadotrope-specific but rather to represent an inherent ability of the GnRH receptor itself (12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test this frequently reiterated paradigm of the multiple G protein coupling ability of the GnRH receptor (2.Kaiser U.B. Conn P.M. Chin W.W. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 46-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23.Hawes B.E. Barnes S.M. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2124-2130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Hawes B.E. Marzen J.E. Waters S.B. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36.Ulloa-Aguirre A. Stanislaus D. Arora V. Väänänen J. Brothers S. Jannovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we set out to study the G protein coupling profile of the murine GnRH receptor endogenously expressed in αT3–1 cells as well as of the human receptor (22.Grosse R. Schöneberg T. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in CHO-K1 and COS-7 cells.Functional studies on the GnRH receptor have been greatly facilitated by the development of the αT3–1 cell line isolated from anterior pituitary tumors of transgenic mice (37.Windle J.J. Weiner R.I. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Consistent with their derivation from the gonadotrope lineage, glycoprotein hormone α-subunit is synthesized and secreted by these cells. In our studies, the total number of specific binding sites for GnRH analogues amounted to 1.1 pmol/mg of protein, slightly higher than those for normal mouse (0.33 pmol/mg) and rat (0.31 pmol/mg) pituitary (38.Horn F. Bilezikjian L.M. Perrin M.H. Bosma M.M. Windle J.J. Huber K.S. Bount A.L. Hille B. Vale W. Mellon PL Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas theB max values for CHO#3 cell membranes (0.3 pmol/mg) heterologously expressing the the human GnRH receptor cDNA were identical with those obtained for pituitary membranes.K d values in the subnanomolar to low nanomolar range reflected high affinity binding of the GnRH superagonist125I-buserelin to two cell models examined by us. Whereas these data conform to those reported by McArdle et al. (39.McArdle C.A. Schomerus E. Groner I. Poch A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 87: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), they contrast with a rather low binding affinity of125I-buserelin (K d = 41 nm) to the recombinant rat GnRH receptor stably expressed in GH3 somatotropes (30.Kuphal D. Janovick J.A. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Considering the similarity of binding characteristics between our experimental systems and gonadotropic cells, it is unlikely that receptor/G protein interaction was substantially affected by receptor overexpression.When GnRH-induced phospholipase C-β activation was studied in αT3–1 and CHO#3 cells, we were unable to detect any inhibitory effect of PTX pretreatment on IP formation and Ca2+mobilization. However, in our hands, a similar regimen substantially reduced IP formation via Gi-coupled receptors (18.Herrlich A. Kühn B. Grosse R. Schmid A. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16764-16772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Stimulation of phospholipase C activity by Gi coupling receptors is thought to occur via Gβγ subunits released from activated Gi proteins (40.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The observation that transient expression of a C-terminal β-adrenergic receptor kinase (GRK2) peptide (βARK-ct) serving as a Gβγ sequestrant suppresses GnRH-dependent IP formation in GH3 cells stably transfected with the rat GnRH receptor, appears to be compatible with the latter notion (41.Guo C.H. Janovick J.A. Kuphal D. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, as other presumably Gi-independent signaling pathways, e.g. cAMP release, are similarly suppressed in the latter study (41.Guo C.H. Janovick J.A. Kuphal D. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3031-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the functional sequelae of βARK-ct expression are not necessarily indicative of GnRH-induced Gi activation. A general impairment of G protein mediated signaling processes due to a quantitative sequestration of Gβγ subunits cannot be ruled out under the above-mentioned experimental conditions.GnRH-mediated ERK activation in αT3–1 cells allegedly depends on a dual mechanism involving protein kinase C on the one hand and PTX-sensitive G proteins on the other hand (25.Sim P.J. Wolbers W.B. Mitchell R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations are at odds with our results, which do not at all entertain the notion of an involvement of Gi/o proteins in GnRH-dependent ERK activity but corroborate the finding that protein kinase C activity plays a pivotal role in this signaling pathway (42.Sundaresan S. Colin I.M. Pestell R.G. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 43.Reiss N. Llevi L.N. Shacham S. Harris D. Seger R. Naor Z. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).To further assess a potential Gi coupling ability of the human GnRH receptor, coexression studies with the chimeric G protein Gsi5, in which the C-terminal five amino acids of Gs were replaced by the corresponding amino acids of Gi2, were performed in COS-7 cells. Several previous studies have shown that the C-terminal five amino acids play a key role in dictating the specificity of receptor/G protein coupling (28.Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Whereas coexpression of Gsi5 with the m2 muscarinic receptor resulted in carbachol-induced cAMP accumulation, no functional interaction between the GnRH receptor and the chimeric G protein was observed. The notion of GnRH receptor/Gi interaction has largely been derived from circumstantial evidence, for instance agonist-dependent palmitoylation of G protein α-subunits (12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In dispersed pituitary cell cultures, however, a challenge with phorbol myristic acid, a protein kinase C activator, was able to partially mimic the GnRH effect (44.Stanislaus D. Janovick J.A. Brothers S. Conn P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 738-746PubMed Google Scholar), thus casting doubts on the specificity of the experimental approach chosen. Moreover, when down-regulation of activated G proteins was used as a read-out system, stimulation of αT3–1 cells with a GnRH agonist resulted in enhanced agonist-dependent proteolysis of Gq/11proteins, whereas Gi2 remained unaffected (45.Shah B.H. MacEwan D.J. Milligan G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1886-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In keeping with the latter findings, our data strongly suggest that human and mouse GnRH receptors are unable to couple to Giproteins.Treatment of rat pituitary cell cultures with CTX increases luteinizing hormone release in response to GnRH (46.Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2131-2135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and it was subsequently inferred that the GnRH receptor might be positively linked to adenylyl cyclase. Whereas in gonadotropes GnRH-stimulated cAMP formation has never been detected (12.Stanislaus D. Pinter J.H. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 144: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 47.McArdle C.A. Counis R. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 168-175Scopus (35) Google Scholar), somatotropic GH3 pituitary cells stably transfected with the rat GnRH receptor cDNA respond to prolonged incubation (>24 h) with GnRH agonists in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with a modest increase in cAMP secretion into the culture medium (30.Kuphal D. Janovick J.A. Kaiser U.B. Chin W.W. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, in permeabilized gonadotropes, cAMP synergizes with Ca2+ and phorbol esters in stimulation of exocytotic gonadotropin release (48.Macrae M.B. Davidson J.S. Millar R.P. van der Merwe P.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP and phospholipase C/Ca2+/diacylglycerol pathways may converge at a later stage of the GnRH signal transduction pathway.Therefore, we set out to examine whether GnRH stimulation of αT3–1 and CHO#3 cells would lead to increased cAMP formation. Dual coupling of a single receptor to Gs and Gq/11 proteins has been demonstrated for several G protein-coupled receptors (33.Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), for instance the H2 histamine (49.Kühn B. Schmid A. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1697-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and the cholecystokinin type A receptor (50.Wu V. Yang M. McRoberts J.A. Ren J. Seensalu R. Zeng N. Dagrag M. Birnbaumer M. Walsh J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9037-9042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the two cell lines tested, GnRH was ineffective in raising intracellular cAMP levels, whereas the inhibition of the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gαs and the direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by CTX and forskolin, respectively, resulted in marked cAMP accumulation. To determine whether the activated GnRH receptor could provoke a subtle and prolonged increase in the basal rate of cAMP formation, CHO#3 cells were transfe"

We studied the functional consequences on P/Q-type Ca2+ channel function of three recently identified mutations, R583Q, D715E, and V1457L after introduction into rabbit α1A and expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The potential for half-maximal channel activation of Ba2+ inward currents was shifted by > 9 mV to more negative potentials in all three mutants. The potential for half-maximal channel inactivation was shifted by > 7 mV in the same direction in R583Q and D715E. Biexponential current inactivation during 3-s test pulses was significantly faster in D715E and slower in V1457L than in wild type. Mutations R583Q and V1457L delayed the time course of recovery from channel inactivation. The decrease of peak current through R583Q (30.2%) and D715E (30.1%) but not V1457L (18.7%) was more pronounced during 1-Hz trains of 15 100-ms pulses than in wild type (18.2%). Our data demonstrate that the mutations R583Q, D715E, and V1457L, like the previously reported mutations T666M, V714A, and I1819L, affect P/Q-type Ca2+channel gating. We therefore propose that altered channel gating represents a common pathophysiological mechanism in familial hemiplegic migraine.

P/Q-type Ca2+ channels have received much attention recently because CACNA1A mutations have been described which are responsible for at least three different neurological human diseases: episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2),1 spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) with and without cerebellar ataxia. These mutations may provide important insight into how altered Ca2+ signaling and neuronal excitability can lead to neurodegeneration and episodic neurological diseases such as migraine.

The mechanisms by which these mutations cause these abnormal phenotypes is unclear. Mutations causing EA-2, an autosomal dominant disease, are predicted to give rise to truncated, presumably nonfunctional α1A proteins. 2D. Kullmann, personal communication.This must result in a partial loss of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel function. In contrast, we (16.Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J. Biol.

FHM is a rare autosomal dominant form of migraine with aura, associated with ictal hemiparesis and, in some families, with cerebellar ataxia and atrophy (18.Terwindt G.M. Ophoff R.A. Haan J. Vergouwe M.N. van Eijk R. Frants R.R. Ferrari M.D. Neurology. 1998; 50: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional expression of rabbit α1A subunits containing the FHM mutations T666M, V714A, and I1811L revealed mutation-induced changes in gating kinetics altering the extent to which P/Q-type channels accumulate in inactivation during trains of depolarizing pulses. We therefore proposed that this could alter Ca2+ influx and signaling during episodes of high neuronal activity. This in turn might result in a long term activation of neurons within the proposed “migraine generator” in the brainstem discovered by brain imaging in migraine patients (19.Diener H.C. May A. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1996; 9: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Essentially the same changes in gating kinetics were reported by Hanset al. (17.Hans M. Luvisetto S. Williams M.E. Spagnolo M. Urrutia A. Tottene A. Brust P.L. Johnson E.C. Harpold M.M. Stauderman K.A. Pietrobon D. J.

In addition, they reported mutation-induced changes in single channel kinetics and expression density.

Mutations were introduced into rabbit class A Ca2+ channel α1A cDNA (BI-II, 1) by applying the “gene-SOEing” technique (20.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

Single mutants R583Q and D715E were constructed according to the previously described procedure for generation of single mutants T666M and V714A (16.Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S.

Mutation V1457L (corresponding to V1465L in rabbit α1A, see legend to Fig. 1) as well as a silent mutation (codon for rabbit Asp-1545 GAC to GAT) were introduced simultaneously into rabbit class A cDNA by polymerase chain reaction to yield a ClaI restriction sequence. The mutated polymerase chain reaction fragment was cut SfiI (4290)-ClaI* (4925) and coligated with a NheI (3543)-SfiI (4290) fragment of BI-II into AL20 NheI (3543)-ClaI (homologous position to ClaI*) (22.Hering S.

To exclude effects of endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents on current kinetics, experiments were carried out in oocytes previously injected with 50–100 nl of a 0.1 m BAPTA solution. Inward Ba2+currents (IBa) through expressed channel complexes were measured using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique as described previously (21.Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Similar current amplitudes were obtained with mutant and wild-type α1A subunits. Oocytes expressing peak IBa smaller than 400 nA or larger than 1.8 μA were excluded from analysis. Data analysis and acquisition were performed by using the pClamp software package (version 6.0, Axon Instruments). Recordings were carried out at room temperature in a bath solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mmNaOH, 2 mm CsOH, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid. Voltage recording and current injecting microelectrodes were filled with 2.8 m CsCl, 0.2m CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) and had resistances of 0.3–2 megohm. Recovery of IBa from inactivation was studied using a double-pulse protocol. After a 3-s depolarizing prepulse to +10 mV (holding potential −80 mV) the time course of IBa recovery was determined at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to +10 mV at various time intervals after the prepulse. Peak IBa was normalized to the peak current amplitude measured during the prepulse. IBa was then allowed to recover for 1 min at −100 mV. This double-pulse protocol was repeated individually for each recovery time interval in the same oocyte. The voltage dependence of inactivation (steady-state inactivation) was determined from normalized inward currents elicited during steps to +10 mV after 10-s steps to various holding potentials. The voltage dependence of activation was determined from I-V curves obtained by step depolarizations from a holding potential of −80 mV to various test potentials. The half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5,act), the slope factor of the curve at V0.5,act (k act,), the half-maximal voltage for steady-state inactivation (V0.5,inact), and the slope factor of the curve (k inact) were obtained by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation. Apparent reversal potentials were calculated by extrapolation from I-V relationships. Nonlinear least square fitting and statistical calculations were performed using OriginR 5.0 (Microcal). Data are given as means ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. Mutations R583Q, D715E, and V1457L, illustrated in Fig.1 A, are located in highly conserved and functionally important regions of the human α1A subunit of neuronal P/Q-type Ca2+channels. Mutation R583Q neutralizes a positive charge in transmembrane segment S4 of the channel in domain II (IIS4). S4 segments form part of the voltage sensor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (26.Armstrong C. Hille B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). D715E is located in IIS6 adjacent to mutation V714A analyzed in our previous study and V1457L in the S5-S6 linker of domain III. Segments S5 and S6 and their connecting linkers are assumed to form the pore of the channel (26.Armstrong C. Hille B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We introduced the single mutations into the corresponding positions of the highly homologous rabbit α1A subunit (wild type, Ref. 1.Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E.

The potential for half-maximal activation (V0.5,act) was significantly (p < 0.01) shifted to hyperpolarized potentials for all three mutants without changing the steepness of the steady-state activation curve (Table I). This effect was most pronounced in D715E. The midpoint voltage for steady-state inactivation was not altered in mutant V1457L, but a significant shift to more negative potentials occurred in R583Q and D715E (Table I). Apparent reversal potentials were similar for all constructs (53–59 mV) ruling out major changes in Ba2+permeability.Table IEffects of mutations on activation and inactivation propertiesV0.5,actkactzgV0.5,inactkinactmVmVWT4.1 ± 0.8−4.1 ± 0.26.2−20.2 ± 1.86.7 ± 0.4R583Q−5.5 ± 0.8*−3.9 ± 0.26.5−27.6 ± 0.7*7.6 ± 0.3D715E−12.6 ± 1.3−3.6 ± 0.17−30.4 ± 0.8*6.1 ± 0.2V1457L−8.5 ± 1.1*−3.8 ± 0.26.6−17.1 ± 0.66.0 ± 0.2*The half-maximal voltage for activation (V0.5,act), the steepness of the curve at V0.5,act (kact), the half-maximal voltage for steady-state inactivation (V0.5,inact), and the steepness of the curve at V0.5,inact (kinact) were obtained by fitting the data to the Boltzmann equation.

WT, wild type. To investigate whether the FHM mutations affect the time course of channel inactivation we analyzed the current decay during 3-s test pulses elicited from a holding potential of −80 mV to +10 mV (Fig.1 B). For wild-type and mutant channels the time course of inactivation could be well described by a double-exponential function. D715E significantly (p < 0.01) accelerated both the time constant for the initial fast component (τfast = 0.142 ± 0.004 s, n = 15) and the slow component (τslow = 0.577 ± 0.008 s, n = 15) of current decay compared with wild type (τfast = 0.227 ± 0.013 s; τslow = 0.806 ± 0.076 s,n = 5) (Fig. 1 C). Mutation V1457L increased the time constant for the slow component of the current decay (τslow = 1.2 ± 0.033 s, n = 11). In R583Q τfast was also slightly accelerated, but this did not reach the level of statistical significance. The contribution of the fast component (wild type: 43.8 ± 2.0%, n = 5) was increased significantly in D715E (57.8 ± 1.5%,n = 14; p < 0.01) and decreased in V1457L (27.4 ± 2.3%, n = 10, p< 0.01). Next we tested whether the mutations also change the extent of peak IBa decrease during pulse trains which reflects accumulation of channels in inactivation. Application of 15 100-ms pulses from a holding potential of −60 mV to a test potential of +10 mV at a frequency of 1 Hz caused a significant (p < 0.01) increase of accumulation in inactivation for mutants R583Q and D715E but not V1457L. Current decay after 15 pulses was 1.6-fold larger in R583Q (30.2 ± 0.8%; n = 35) and D715E (30.1 ± 1.5%; n = 18) than in wild type (19.1 ± 1%; n = 19) (Fig.2, A and B). The fraction of channels inactivating during frequent depolarizations not only depends on the inactivation rate during the pulses but also on the rate of recovery from inactivation between pulses. Therefore recovery from inactivation was measured employing a double-pulse protocol (Fig. 3 A). Channels were inactivated by a 3-s conditioning prepulse from −80 to +10 mV. The time course of recovery was then determined at −60 mV by applying 300-ms test pulses to +10 mV after various time intervals after the prepulse (Fig. 3 A). Between single double-pulse experiments the oocytes were held at −100 mV for 60 s to allow full recovery of IBa. Recovery was determined at −60 mV to maximize the difference between wild-type and mutant channels. In wild-type and mutant channels about 90% of IBa recovered after 20 s. In all constructs recovery of IBa followed a biexponential time course (Fig. 3 B). In both R583Q and V1457L the fraction of recovered current at all time intervals measured was significantly smaller (p < 0.01) than in wild type. No change was observed for D715E (Fig. 3 B). In summary, our experiments convincingly show that all newly discovered α1A mutations in patients with FHM cause abnormal gating behavior of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Gating changes therefore seem to represent an elementary mechanism underlying P/Q-type Ca2+ channel dysfunction in FHM. We have studied the functional consequences of three recently identified FHM missense mutations, R583Q, D715E, and V1457L within the α1A subunit of neuronal P/Q-type Ca2+channels. None of the mutations resulted in a nonfunctional channel as proposed for EA-2 mutations in the α1A subunit gene. EA-2 mutations (5.Ophoff R.A. Terwindt G.M. Vergouwe M.N. van Eijk R. Oefner P.J. Hoffmann S.M.G. Lamerdin J.E. Mohrenweiser H.W. Bulman D.E. Ferrari M. Haan J. Lindhout D. van Ommen G.J.B. Hofker M.H. Ferrari M.D. Frants R.R.

Neurology. 1999; 52: 1816-1821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are believed to be incompatible with the expression of a functional protein. In the presence of an unaffected gene, it is therefore likely that the observed neurological phenotype in EA-2 results from a reduced activity of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in the central nervous system. Instead, two independent mechanisms can affect P/Q-type currents in FHM patients: altered expression density and changes in channel gating. Hans et al. (17.Hans M. Luvisetto S. Williams M.E. Spagnolo M. Urrutia A. Tottene A. Brust P.L. Johnson E.C. Harpold M.M. Stauderman K.A. Pietrobon D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently found that FHM mutations decrease or increase the density of functional P/Q-type currents after heterologous expression inXenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. It is difficult to predict if these changes of expression density also occur in vivo where, in addition to the accessory α2-δ and β subunits, α1A interacts with a number of other modulatory proteins such as G-proteins (27.Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), calmodulin (28.Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar), and synaptic vesicle proteins (29.Rettig J. Sheng Z.-H. Kim D.K. Hodson C.D. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7363-7368Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Clearly, this important question can only be addressed in animal models containing the respective mutations. A second mechanism by which FHM mutations can affect P/Q-type Ca2+ currents is by changing channel gating. Our electrophysiological analysis provides convincing evidence that such changes also occur in three recently identified FHM mutations. Together with our previous results (16.Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5586-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) this allows us to conclude that, irrespective of changes in expression density, this represents an elementary functional alteration underlying P/Q-type Ca2+channel dysfunction in FHM. As for T666M, V714A, and I1811L, all three new mutations significantly shifted the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials. In the absence of changes in the slope of the activation curve this must result in a more negative threshold of Ca2+channel activation. This could lead to altered Ca2+signaling by increasing P/Q-type Ca2+ channel activity at weak depolarizations. Two of the mutations also caused a more pronounced decrease of IBa during pulse trains, reflecting altered accumulation of channels in inactivation. This can result from either increased inactivation during the pulse or delayed recovery from inactivation between pulses. Our experiments demonstrate that it is due to slower recovery from inactivation in R583Q and faster inactivation in D715E. In V1457L decrease of IBa during the train was not different from wild type. This can be explained by the slower inactivation kinetics, which are counteracted by the slowed recovery from inactivation. Altered accumulation of channels in inactivation during rapid depolarizations could cause changes in Ca2+influx especially during high but not during low neuronal activity. This may underlie the episodic character of FHM with attacks triggered by sensory or emotional stimuli. In addition to the potential insight into the pathophysiology of migraine, mutations R583Q and D715E also provide us with interesting molecular information about channel function. As in the previously analyzed mutant R192Q (16.Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5586-5590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), R583Q eliminates a conserved positive charge at the extracellular side of transmembrane S4-helix, which forms part of the voltage sensor of the channel. The charge neutralization at position 583 in IIS4 (R583Q) shifted the voltage dependence of activation (and inactivation) to more negative potentials and slowed recovery from inactivation. These findings indicate that not only mutations in the putative pore region (T666M, V714A, I1811L) but also in the S4 segments can alter α1A recovery from inactivation. This illustrates that conformational changes of voltage-sensing portions of α1A are involved in this process. Mutation R583Q caused a negative shift of V0.5,act without a change in the apparent gating charge, z g(Table I). Based on a simplified model describing the gating of a channel with only two states (open and closed) (Equation 2-22 in Ref.30.Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar; 31) a negative shift of V0.5,act suggests that this mutation decreases the conformational energy difference between the closed and open states. By assuming a model in which the voltage sensors in all four repeats move independently it can be predicted that Arg-583 (in IIS4) forms part of a voltage sensor which moves over potentials close to those causing channel opening. This is in contrast to data reported earlier for an α1S (skeletal muscle)/α1C (cardiac muscle) chimera where this was observed for sensors in repeats I and III but not in repeat II. Therefore this naturally occurring mutation clearly demonstrates that voltage sensor movements vary not only between different voltage-dependent cation channels (31.Garcia J. Nakai J. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2515-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but even between different Ca2+ channel α1subunits. Mutation D715E is located adjacent to mutation V714A. Together with I1811L in IVS6 these are believed to be located close to the cytoplasmic mouth of the pore. Unlike V714A and I1811L, D715E did not affect recovery from inactivation and prominently accelerated current inactivation upon depolarization. These data indicate that the cytoplasmic end of S6 helices comprise a functionally relevant region within α1A which tightly controls the channel's inactivation properties. Although our data do not allow us to propose a defined molecular mechanism for this process they clearly show that even minor structural changes such as the introduction of a single side chain methyl group in mutant D715E are sufficient to disturb this functional domain. The present work clearly shows that mutations in the humanCACNA1A gene alter the gating properties of neuronal P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in all seven FHM mutants analyzed so far. This provides a rational basis for the generation of mutant mice containing selected mutations. Introduction of FHM mutations differing with respect to their biophysical properties should enable electrophysiological analysis of the consequences of altered channel gating for neuronal Ca2+ signaling in FHM and more common forms of migraine (15.May A.

There is evidence that these seismic free oscillations resonate with acoustic free oscillations of the atmosphere. The observed amplitudes suggest that the excitation source is at or just above Earth's surface."

These changes are associated with cell acidification in some models of apoptosis. The hierarchical relationship between these events has, however, not been deciphered. We have shown that somatostatin (SST), acting via the Src homology 2 bearing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, exerts cytotoxic action in MCF-7 cells, and triggers cell acidification and apoptosis. We investigated the temporal sequence of apoptotic events linking caspase activation, acidification, and mitochondrial dysfunction in this system and report here that (i) SHP-1-mediated caspase-8 activation is required for SST-induced decrease in pHi. (ii) Effector caspases are induced only when there is concomitant acidification. (iii) Decrease in pHi is necessary to induce reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, cyt c release and caspase-9 activation and (iv) depletion of ATP ablates SST-induced cytc release and caspase-9 activation, but not its ability to induce effector caspases and apoptosis. These data reveal that SHP-1-/caspase-8-mediated acidification occurs at a site other than the mitochondrion and that SST-induced apoptosis is not dependent on disruption of mitochondrial function and caspase-9 activation.

This process drives the cell into self-destruction via a common execution pathway. The cellular machinery utilized for this process creates distinct apoptotic features of cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, chromatin compaction, and fragmentation of chromosomal DNA into 180-base pair multimers. A central event in the process of apoptosis is the activation of cysteine aspartate proteases (caspases) (1.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). Active caspases consist of dimeric complexes of ∼20- and 10-kDa fragments derived from the procaspases that exist as inactive zymogens by internal proteolytic cleavage at cysteine-aspartate sites (2.Walker N.P.

Mammalian caspases can be divided into initiator (e.g.caspases 2, 8, 9, 10) and effector (caspases 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13) enzymes. A feature of apoptosis that impinges on caspases is altered mitochondrial function characterized by a reduction in the electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane (Δψm)1 and release of mitochondrial cyt c into the cytoplasm (3.Vayssiere J.L.

Res. 1997; 230: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For instance, contradictory reports suggest that the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk prevents decrease in pHi, whereas acidification per se was found to activate z-VAD-fmk-sensitive caspases (27.Furlong I. Ascaso R. Rivas A. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 653-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Wolf C.M. Reynolds J.E. Morana S.J. Eastman A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1997; 230: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since z-VAD-fmk inhibits both initiator and effector caspases, its use does not allow differentiation between caspases that may be activated in a pHi-sensitive and -insensitive manner during apoptosis associated with acidification. The temporal relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and acidification has not been definitively established, although it was reported recently that loss of Δψm may trigger a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in hematopoietic cells (27.Furlong I. Ascaso R. Rivas A. Collins M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 653-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Wolf C.M. Reynolds J.E. Morana S.J. Eastman A. Exp. Cell.

Somatostatin (SST) receptor (SSTR)-mediated cytotoxic signaling triggers acidification and apoptosis in MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells: prevention of acidification by pH clamping inhibited its ability to induce apoptosis (33.Sharma K.

Translocation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 from the cytosol to the membrane is an early and essential event in SST-induced cell acidification and apoptosis (34.Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D.

When ectopically expressed, SHP-1 lowered the resting pHi of MCF-7 cells (pHi = 7.07 versus 7.25 in cells transfected with the empty vector), and amplified not only the cytotoxic action of SST, but also acidification-induced apoptosis. Moreover, agonist-induced acidification and acidification-induced apoptosis were both inhibited by the dominant negative suppressive effect SHP-1C455S (35.Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Leber B.

In the present study we undertook to delineate the temporal sequence of activation of different caspases in relation to cellular acidification and mitochondrial dysfunction during SST-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. We present evidence demonstrating that caspase 8 activation is necessary for intracellular acidification to occur during SST-induced apoptosis and that the effector caspases are induced only as a consequence of the decrease in pHi. Moreover, the reduction in Δψm and the release of cyt cinto the cytosol from the mitochondria also occur distal to acidification. Depletion of ATP prevented the activation of caspase-9 but only partially inhibited its ability to activate the terminal caspases and induce apoptosis. These data suggest that SST-induced, acidification-dependent, apoptosis is not dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction. The MCF-7 cell line (clone HTB22) was obtained from ATCC. Special reagents were obtained from the following sources: [d-Trp8]SST-14 (Bachem, Torrance, CA); annexin-V labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Montreal, CA); nigericin (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Carboxy-SNARF-1 acetoxymethyl ester and 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Aminomethylcoumarin derivatives (caspase substrates) and aldehyde derivatives (caspase inhibitors) of tetrapeptide sequences that are recognized by distinct caspases: IETD (caspase-8), LEHD (caspase-9), and DEVD (caspases-3/-7) (BioMol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Antibodies against the different caspases and cyt c were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). All other reagents used were of analytical grade and were obtained from regular commercial sources. Cells were plated in 75-cm2 culture flasks and grown in minimal essential medium containing non-essential amino acids and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm [d-Trp8]SST-14 for different time periods as indicated. To examine the effect of direct acidification, cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 140 mm K+ and 10 nm nigericin. Caspase inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and used at 1:1000 dilution to yield a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. Depletion of intracellular ATP was achieved in glucose-deprived cells by inhibiting F0/F1-ATPase with oligomycin (37.Lee C. Ernster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 10 mm oligomycin in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Canadian Life Technologies, Guelph, Ontario) supplemented with 50 mm malic acid, 2 mm glutamate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES/Na+ (pH 7.4), 0.05 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum as described by Eguchi et al. (38.Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar) prior to peptide treatment. Cellular ATP was measured using a commercial luciferase luminescence assay kit (Sigma). The ATP concentration decreased by >83 ± 6% (n = 4) following oligomycin treatment (data not shown). Apoptosis was determined by annexin-V positivity using the annexin-V-FLUOS kit (Roche Diagnostics, Montreal, Canada) or by the presence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments as described previously (34.Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Liu D. Shen S.-H. Srikant C.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Shen S.-H. Srikant C.B. J. Biol.

Cells labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin-V and propidium iodide were analyzed by flow cytometry in a Becton Dickinson Vantage Plus flow cytometer. A 5-watt argon laser generating light at 351–363 nm was used as the excitation source and fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was detected with a 560-nm short pass dichroic filter while propidium iodide fluorescence was detected using a 610-nm long pass filter. At least 10,000 gated events were recorded for each sample and the data analyzed by Winlist software (Verity Software House, ME). To assess DNA fragmentation, DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform from cells incubated in lysis buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9) containing 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 48 °C for 30 h. DNA extracts were incubated with 300 μg/ml bovine pancreatic RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and 10-μg aliquots of DNA samples containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels using the Hoefer SwitchbackTM pulse controller and visualized under UV light. For measuring intracellular pH, cells were loaded with 10 μm acetoxymethylester derivative of SNARF-1 for the final hour of incubation in the absence or presence of 100 nm[d-Trp8]SST-14 at 37 °C (39.Sharma K. Srikant C.B. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cells were then scraped, washed, and maintained at 37 °C. Intracellular carboxy SNARF-1 was excited at 488 nm and emission was recorded at both 580 and 640 nm with 5-nm band pass filters with linear amplifiers in a Becton-Dickinson FACStar Vantage cytometer. The ratio of the emissions at these wavelengths was electronically calculated and used as a parameter indicative of pHi. The intracellular pH values were estimated by comparison of the mean ratios of the samples to a calibration curve of intracellular pH generated by incubation of carboxy-SNARF-1 loaded cells in buffers ranging in pH from 8.0 to 6.25 and containing the proton ionophore nigericin (33.Sharma K. Srikant C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells with fluorescence of <50 units were excluded in the calculation of the ratio of the emissions at 580 and 640 nm. DiOC6(3) (50 nm final concentration) was added to the cells 15 min prior to the completion of incubation. The cells were then washed to remove excess fluorochrome, scraped, and maintained at 37 °C. DiOC6(3) fluorescence was measured in a EPICS 750 series Flow Cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 488 and 520 nm, respectively. At least 10,000 events were recorded for each sample and the data analyzed by WinList Program (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 ml of a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m M EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Montreal, CA). The cells were homogenized in a Pyrex homogenizer using a type B pestle. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial fraction was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant obtained at this stage was re-centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosolic fraction. Thirty micrograms of cytosolic fractions prepared from cells incubated under different experimental conditions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to immunoblot analysis for cyt c, or caspases-8, -9, -3, and -7. Activities of caspases were measured in the lysates measuring the in vitro hydrolysis of DEVD-AMC (caspases-3 and -7), IETD-AMC (caspase-8), and LEHD-AMC (caspase-9) (40.Thornberry N.A.

The fluorescence of the aminomethylcoumarin released from the substrates was measured in a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorimeter with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Enzyme activity was quantitated against a standard fluorescence curve generated using aminomethylcoumarin over a concentration range of 0–1000 nm. In order to determine the hierarchy of caspase activation during acidification-dependent apoptosis we measured the time course of [d-Trp8]SST-14-induced changes in enzyme activities using substrates that display specificity for initiator and effector caspases in vitro: IETD-AMC (caspase-8) and DEVD-AMC (caspases-3/-7) respectively. In cells incubated with 100 nm[d-Trp8]SST-14 a concentration which induced maximal apoptosis (35.Thangaraju M. Sharma K. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Shen S.-H. Srikant C.B. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1998; 76: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the IETD-AMC hydrolyzing activity was maximal by 3 h (6-fold increase over the basal value of 0.5 nmol/mg protein, Fig. 1), but had fallen to basal levels by 24 h. By contrast, DEVD-specific caspase activity increased by <3-fold during SST treatment but continued to increase and remained elevated even at 24 h (1.21 ± 0.14 and 3.61 ± 0.7, respectively, compared with 0.45 ± 0.05 nmol/mg protein in untreated control cells). When acidification was prevented by pH clamping by the inclusion of nigericin, SST-induced increase in IETDase was unaffected whereas its ability to induce DEVDase activity was completely inhibited (Fig. 2). We next examined the effect of selective inhibitors of these caspases on SST-induced acidification and apoptosis. IETD-CHO (the tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor of caspase-8) prevented the decrease pHi in SST-treated cells whereas DEVD-CHO (the caspase-3/-7 inhibitor) was without effect (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, the ability of SST to induce apoptosis was suppressed by both inhibitors as confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig.3 B) and by annexin-V positivity (not shown). The temporal sequence of activation of the different caspases during [d-Trp8]SST-14-induced apoptosis was confirmed by measuring the effect of each of the caspase inhibitors on the activities of other caspases (Fig.4). IETD-specific caspase activation by SST was unaffected by DEVD-CHO (Fig. 4 A) but the inductive effect of SST on DEVD-specific caspase activity was totally inhibited by IETD-CHO (Fig. 4 B).Figure 2Effect of pH clamping on caspase activation. [d-Trp8]SST-14 induced increase in caspase-8 (IETDase) activity was not affected by the prevention of acidification by nigericin (top panel) whereas pH clamping prevented the increase in caspase-3/-7 (DEVDase) activity (bottom panel).

Cyt creleased from the mitochondria complexes with APAF-1 (the mammalian homolog of the pro-apoptotic protein CED-4 of Caenorhabditis elegans) and procaspase-9. Such activation of caspase-9 has been reported to be necessary for the full expression of nuclear apoptotic events (44.Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol.

To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction precedes or follows acidification, we compared the effects of pH clamping and different caspase inhibitors on Δψm, cyt crelease, and caspase-9 activation in SST-treated cells. SST induced a decrease in Δψm in MCF-7 cells (Fig.5 A). Inhibition of acidification by pH clamping totally abrogated the ability of SST to decrease Δψm. Maximal effect was seen at 6 h when 48 ± 7% of SST-treated cells displayed a significant reduction in Δψm compared with the untreated control (Fig.5 B). Additionally, loss of Δψm during SST treatment was prevented almost completely by IETD-CHO but was decreased only by 23 ± 3% by DEVD-CHO (Fig. 5 B). A marked increase in cytosolic cyt c content was seen in SST-treated cells (Fig. 6). Such an increase did not occur when acidification was prevented by pH clamping. SST-induced increase in cytosolic cyt c was completely suppressed by IETD-CHO but was not inhibited by inhibition of effector caspases by DEVD-CHO. We measured the caspase-9 activity in extracts of cells incubated with SST using the tetrapeptide substrate LEHD-AMC, a substrate with reported caspase-9 selectivity (41.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A.

LEHD-specific caspase activity was induced by SST in MCF-7 cells in an acidification-dependent manner (Fig.7).

APC may contribute to the physiological/pathological mechanism of gelatinase A activation, especially during angiogenesis. matrix metalloproteinase membrane-type MMP activated protein C human umbilical vein endothelial cells tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 Angiogenesis is a prominent feature of cancer and arthritis. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP),1 gelatinase A, plays a vital role during angiogenesis by degrading the collagens present in the basement membrane (1.Basbaum C.B. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and allowing the endothelial cells to invade the stroma. The enzyme is constitutively expressed by human endothelial cells in a latent form and can be activated by membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) on the cell surface (2.Sato H. Seiki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Activation can be induced in endothelial cells by non-physiological agents, such as phorbol myristate acetate, resulting in the generation of the intermediate active 62-kDa and the fully active 59-kDa species (3.Foda H.D. George S. Conner C. Drews M. Tompkins D.C. Zucker S. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 538-545PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, two physiological agents, thrombin and type I collagen, have been shown to activate gelatinase A in human and rat endothelial cells, respectively (4.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Hass T.L. Davis S.J. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3604-3610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Activated protein C (APC) is a serine protease that plays a central role in physiological anticoagulation. The inactive precursor, protein C, is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized by the liver and found in the plasma. Activation of protein C occurs on the endothelial cell surface and is triggered by a complex formed between thrombin and thrombomodulin (6.Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1999; 9: 946-955Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). APC functions as an anticoagulant by binding to the co-factor, protein S, which inactivates the clotting factors Factor VIIIa and Factor Va. The importance of APC as an anticoagulant is reflected by the findings that deficiencies in this molecule result in familial disorders of thrombosis (7.Baker W.F. Bick R.L. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1999; 25: 387-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-coagulant activity, APC has been reported to have an anti-inflammatory effect (8.Cicala C. Cirino G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1817-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the current report we describe a new role for APC, demonstrating that it can activate gelatinase A in human endothelial cells. Human APC and human protein C were obtained from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). TIMP2 was purchased from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY). 1,10-Phenanthroline was obtained from Sigma. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated and maintained as described previously (9.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). HUVEC were grown in Biorich containing 20% fetal calf serum plus 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). Cells were used at passage four. Cells were plated down at 30,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in growth medium for 5 days. They were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and preincubated for 6 h in basal medium (Biorich plus 1% normal pooled human serum, which was stripped of gelatinases by running through a gelatin-Sepharose column) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The culture medium was then replaced with fresh basal medium, and test agents were added for 24 h. The conditioned media were collected for analysis. To ensure that the results were standardized between wells, the cell numbers were quantitated using the CellTiter One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell numbers did not differ between any of the treatments used in the experiments (data not shown). Gelatinase A was detected using gelatin zymography under non-reducing conditions as described previously (10.Herron G.S. Banda M.J. Clark E.J. Gavrilovic J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2814-2818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were scanned into an IBM PC, and the intensity of the bands was semi-quantitated using Scion Image (Meyer Instruments, Houston, TX). Latent and active gelatinase A were detected by Western analysis after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A monoclonal antibody to gelatinase A (Oncogene Science) was used at 2 μg/ml. The extraction of total RNA was performed using the acid guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (11.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA was run on a 1% agarose gel containing 1.25 m formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Sigma) and cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation. Northern analysis for MT1-MMP was performed as described previously (4.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar). The MT1-MMP probe was generously provided by Prof. Paul Basset (Illkirch, France). HUVEC were treated with human APC or no test agent for 24 h, and the conditioned media were analyzed for gelatinase A by zymography. Results are shown in Fig. 1 a. Consistent with our previous report (12.Jackson C.J. Nguyen M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), under basal conditions, HUVEC expressed a prominent latent form, a 62-kDa intermediate form (∼3% total gelatinase A activity, as determined by scanning densitometry) and a barely detectable level of the 59-kDa fully active form of gelatinase A (<1% total protein). Treatment of cells with 100 nm APC substantially enhanced the amount of the 59-kDa fully active form to ∼8% of total gelatinase A activity. Western analysis confirmed the activation of gelatinase A by APC (Fig.1 b). APC was dose-responsive in its activation of gelatinase A (Fig.1 a). When used at 200 nm, APC increased the amount of the 59-kDa fully active enzyme by approximately 2.1-fold, compared with 100 nm. Interestingly, there was a concomitant decrease in the amount of the intermediate species generated as the concentration of APC increased. At 300 nm, APC converted almost all the intermediate form to the fully active form. In contrast, the inactive zymogen, protein C, did not activate gelatinase A when used at similar concentrations to APC (Fig.1 c). Time course experiments revealed that APC induced the fully active form as early as 4 h, the levels of which progressively increased after 12 and 24 h of exposure to APC (Fig.2). Previous workers have shown that plasmin (13.Mazzieri R. Masiero L. Zanetta L. Monea S. Onisto M. Garbisa S. Mignatti P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2319-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14.Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. Lhoir C. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noel A. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) can activate gelatinase A to the fully active form in HT1080 cells. To determine whether contaminating plasmin was contributing toward endothelial gelatinase A activation by APC, we tested whether the serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, was able to inhibit activation. Aprotinin inhibits plasmin, trypsin, and kallikrein but not APC (15.Gebhard N. Tschesche H. Fritz H. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry of Aprotinin and Aprotinin-like Inhibitors in Protease Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 375-388Google Scholar). The inhibitor was added to HUVEC in the presence of 100 nm APC for 16–20 h at concentrations of 10 or 25 μm. Aprotinin did not inhibit APC-induced gelatinase A activation at either concentration (Fig. 3). This suggests that activation of endothelial gelatinase A is attributable to APC and is not due to plasmin. We examined whether the activation by APC was mediated through the well described MT1-MMP pathway. First, we measured the levels of mRNA for MT1-MMP by Northern analysis. HUVEC did not up-regulate MT1-MMP mRNA after stimulation with 100 nmAPC for 24 h (Fig. 4). To confirm that MT1-MMP was not involved, we tested the effects of the MMP inhibitor, 1,10-phenanthroline, at 10 μg/ml. Previous workers have shown that MT1-MMP-mediated activation of gelatinase A is blocked by 1,10-phenanthroline at this concentration (4.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar). HUVEC were stimulated with APC (100 nm) for 24 h in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, and the conditioned medium was analyzed using zymography. Results are shown in Fig. 3. As expected, phenanthroline (shown as Phenan in Fig. 3) inhibited the production of the 62-kDa intermediate form, which has previously been shown to be generated by constitutively expressed MT1-MMP (12.Jackson C.J. Nguyen M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, the generation of the 59-kDa fully active form by APC was not affected by phenanthroline. Together, these results suggested that activation of gelatinase A by APC does not require active MT1-MMP. To determine whether APC was dependent upon MT1-MMP or another endothelial membrane protein(s), we examined its effect on gelatinase A in the absence of cells. HUVEC-conditioned medium, which contains latent gelatinase A, was incubated in the presence or absence of 100 nm APC for 24 h at 37 °C. The samples were then measured for gelatinase A activity using zymography (Fig. 5). In the absence of APC, conditioned medium contained an intermediate band and barely detectable fully active band of gelatinase A. In response to APC, the levels of the fully active band were markedly elevated, indicating that APC directly activated gelatinase A and did not require the presence of cells. TIMP2 has several functions, which are independent of its inhibition of MMPs. For example, TIMP2 binds to the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A and at low concentrations promotes activation via MT1-MMP (16.Zucker S. Drews M. Conner C. Foda H.D. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Bahou W.F. Docherty A.P. Cao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1216-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 17.Cao J. Drews M. Lee H.M. Conner C. Bahou W.F. Zucker S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34745-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of TIMP2 on APC-induced activation of gelatinase A. TIMP2 (10 or 25 nm) was added to HUVEC in the presence of 100 nm APC for 24 h. The results of zymographic analysis of the conditioned medium are shown in Fig. 6. When used at 10 and 25 nm, TIMP2 completely inhibited the generation of the intermediate form. This observation is in agreement with previous workers who reported that excess TIMP2 inhibits the formation of the 62-kDa intermediate species generated by MT1-MMP (18.Kinoshita T. Sato H. Okada A. Ohuchi E. Imai K. Okada Y. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16098-16103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 19.Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Interestingly, at both concentrations, TIMP2 partially prevented the formation of the 59-kDa fully active species generated by APC. At 25 nm, TIMP2 inhibited the fully active form by 83 ± 1.7% as determined by scanning densitometry (mean of 3 cell lines). Since we have shown that MT1-MMP is not involved in this process (Figs.3 and 4), it appears that TIMP2 is playing an independent role during APC-induced gelatinase A activation. It is feasible that excess TIMP2 may interfere with an interaction between APC and gelatinase A (and possibly other molecules) and thus partially reduces activation. The mechanism of TIMP2 inhibition needs to be further explored. Our report is the first to show that the serine protease, APC, activates gelatinase A. Two other serine proteases, plasmin and thrombin, have previously been shown to activate gelatinase A. In contrast to our results for APC, activation by plasmin is fully inhibited by TIMP2 in HT1080 cells (14.Baramova E.N. Bajou K. Remacle A. Lhoir C. Krell H.W. Weidle U.H. Noel A. Foidart J.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, in the absence of cell membranes, APC activates gelatinase A, whereas plasmin does not activate but rapidly generates degradation products that lack catalytic activity. Thus, it appears that APC works via a different mechanism to plasmin. Zucker et al. (20.Zucker S. Conner C. Dimassmo B.I. Ende H. Drews M. Seiki M. Bahou W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23730-23738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) first reported that thrombin can induce gelatinase A activation in human endothelial cells. We have recently shown that activation of gelatinase A by thrombin is rapid, efficient, and independent of MT1-MMP (4.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we have shown here that APC generates the fully active form within 4 h and does not require MT1-MMP. Thrombin, through its interaction with thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface, is a physiological activator of protein C (21.Esmon C.T. Fukudome K. Mather T. Bode W. Regan L.M. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 254-259PubMed Google Scholar). It is feasible that thrombin-induced activation is mediated through APC. This is currently under investigation. MT1-MMP has recently been implicated as the key participant in physiological activation of gelatinase A in most cell types, including human endothelial cells (3.Foda H.D. George S. Conner C. Drews M. Tompkins D.C. Zucker S. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 538-545PubMed Google Scholar). HUVEC express MT1-MMP under basal conditions, which can be up-regulated by the potent tumor-promoting chemical, phorbol myristate acetate (3.Foda H.D. George S. Conner C. Drews M. Tompkins D.C. Zucker S. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 538-545PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there have been no reported physiological agents that activate gelatinase A via MT1-MMP in human endothelial cells. Prior to the current report, thrombin, which acts via a mechanism independent of MT1-MMP (4.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar), was the only known physiological substance that can activate gelatinase A in these cells. The contribution of MT1-MMP, thrombin, or APC in physiological/pathological activation of endothelial gelatinase A is unknown. It is possible that these molecules act synergistically to generate active gelatinase A. Whereas the biological actions of plasmin and thrombin are multifactorial, APC is thought to be a relatively selective enzyme. In the presence of its cofactor, Protein S, it inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa, which leads to anti-coagulation (6.Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1999; 9: 946-955Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The reason(s) that this pivotal molecule involved in physiological anti-coagulation activates gelatinase A is unclear. It is unlikely that the active gelatinase A directly contributes to fibrinolysis, as Bini et al. (22.Bini A. Itoh Y. Kudryk B.J. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13056-13063Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that gelatinase A does not cleave fibrin. However, there is ample evidence to show that gelatinase A plays a vital role during angiogenesis. It induces vascular network formation when added to endothelial cells cultured on Matrigel (23.Schnaper H.W. Grant D.S. Stetlerstevenson W.G. Fridman R. Dorazi G. Murphy A.N. Bird R.E. Hoythya M.

Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 391-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a fragment of the hemopexin-like domain of gelatinase A, termed PEX, significantly disrupted angiogenesis in the CAM system. Itoh et al. (25.Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported a substantial reduction in both angiogenic activity and tumor progression in gelatinase A-deficient mice. Our finding that APC activates gelatinase A suggests that a link exists between anticoagulation and angiogenesis. This is supported by the recent findings of O'Reillyet al. (26.O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that a cleaved conformation of antithrombin III has potent anti-angiogenic activity. They concluded that the clotting and fibrinolytic pathways are directly involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. It is tempting to speculate that APC activates gelatinase A in angiogenic diseases such as cancer and arthritis, where clotting abnormalities are present. The inhibition of APC-induced gelatinase A activation may prove useful as a potential therapeutic target in angiogenic diseases.

We have developed a “retrovirus library-based activity dissection” method to generate mSR-BI mutants in which some, but not all, of the activities of this multifunctional protein have been disrupted. This method employs three techniques: 1) efficient in vitro cDNA mutagenesis (here error-prone PCR was used), 2) efficient retroviral delivery and high expression of single mutant cDNAs into individual cells, and 3) isolation of infected cells expressing the desired mutant phenotype using high sensitivity positive/negative screening by two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

Mutation at either site alone did not generate as strong a mutant phenotype (loss of DiI uptake from DiI-HDL) as did the double mutations. “Activity-dissected” double mutants were as effective as wild-type mSR-BI in functioning as LDL receptors, mediating high affinity LDL binding and uptake of metabolically active cholesterol from LDL, but they lost most of their corresponding HDL receptor activity. Thus, these mutants provide support for the proposal that the interaction of SR-BI with HDL differs from that with LDL.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 4.Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 5.Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For example, scavenger receptor class B, type I, SR-BI1 (1.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Krieger M Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which was the first molecularly well defined native HDL receptor identified (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar), can also bind unmodified LDL, unmodified VLDL, anionic phospholipids, as well as a number of modified proteins including acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, and maleylated-BSA (1.Acton S.L.

In transfected cultured cells expressing high levels of murine (m)SR-BI, HDL is a very effective competitor for mSR-BI-mediated 125I-HDL cell association (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). In contrast, LDL, which binds more tightly to mSR-BI than HDL (1.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar), only poorly competes for HDL association (Ref. 6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar, and see below). These findings suggested distinct modes of binding, and perhaps distinct binding sites, for these lipoproteins on mSR-BI. Unlike the classic LDL receptor, which mediates endocytosis of the intact LDL particle via coated pits and vesicles and its subsequent hydrolysis in lysosomes (9.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of the cholesteryl esters from HDL (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Selective lipid uptake is fundamentally different from LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis. It involves efficient transfer of the lipid, but not the protein (apolipoprotein), components from HDL to cells, and it does not involve the internalization and subsequent degradation of the intact lipoprotein particle (10, 11, reviewed in Ref. 2.Krieger M Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that SR-BI-mediated selective lipid uptake is a two-step process, in which high affinity lipoprotein binding is followed by receptor-mediated transfer of lipid from the lipoprotein particle to the cell membrane (12.Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13.Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). After lipid transfer, the lipid-depleted lipoprotein particle is released from the cells and re-enters the extracellular space. SR-BI can mediate selective uptake of lipid from LDL as well as HDL (14.Stangl H. Cao G. Wyne K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31002-31008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15.Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol.

SR-BI is highly expressed in liver and steroidogenic tissues and plays a central role in controlling plasma HDL levels and cholesterol stores in steroidogenic tissues (2.Krieger M Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M.

A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI in mice can result in decreases in cholesterol in VLDL, LDL/intermediate density lipoprotein, and HDL and reductions in apoB and apoA-I (18.Kozarsky K.F.

Furthermore, SR-BI overexpression has been reported to reduce diet (high fat, high cholesterol) induced increases in VLDL and LDL apoB in transgenic mice (19.Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 20.Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). These data suggest that SR-BI might play a role in LDL as well as HDL metabolism in vivo. An SR-BI null mutation in the chow-diet fed apoE KO mouse model of atherosclerosis dramatically accelerates atherosclerosis (21.Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and overexpression of SR-BI in either fat-fed LDL receptor-deficient or apoE-deficient mice decreases atherosclerosis (22.Arai T.

Biol. 2000; 20: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although these studies show that SR-BI is atheroprotective in mice, and thus a potential therapeutic target in humans, the relative importance of the activities of SR-BI as a receptor for HDLversus LDL for this protection from atherosclerosis remains uncertain (22.Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24.Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Glick J.M. Krieger M. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Structure/function analysis of multifunctional proteins such as SR-BI can be facilitated by the identification of mutant forms of those proteins in which a subset of their activities or properties are disrupted. Here we describe a method to isolate such mutants, called retrovirus library-based activity dissection. This approach is based on three techniques: 1) efficient mutagenesis of all or part of the cDNA encoding the multifunctional protein to generate a large, complex library of mutant cDNAs (here error-prone PCR was used); 2) efficient delivery of single mutant cDNAs from the library into individual cells and high level expression using retroviruses and retrovirus-receptor expressing cells; and 3) isolation of infected cells expressing the desired mutant phenotype (retention of some functions, loss of others) using high sensitivity positive/negative screening by two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Others have previously reported the use of random mutagenesis, retroviral cDNA transduction, and selection to isolate gain of function mutants with a single mutant phenotype (e.g.altered cell morphology or hormone-independent cell growth, see Refs.25.Kimelman D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar and 26.Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L.-F. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Using the retrovirus library-based activity dissection method, we identified two sites in mSR-BI that, when simultaneously mutated to arginines, dramatically reduced native HDL binding to the receptor without substantially altering the levels of high affinity LDL binding or uptake of metabolically active cholesterol from LDL. Such “activity dissected” mutants should help clarify the molecular basis for the complex binding properties of SR-BI and, if expressed in animal models, may help provide insights into the mechanism(s) underlying the atheroprotective effects of SR-BI. Human HDL, LDL, 125I-labeled HDL (125I-HDL), 125I-labeled LDL (125I-LDL), and DiI (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate)-labeled HDL (DiI-HDL) were prepared as described previously (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar, 12.Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). All 125I-HDL preparations were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to ensure that the preparations were free of radiolytic or oxidative damage. Alexa 488 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Alexa 488-labeled HDL (Alexa-HDL) was prepared following the manufacturer's suggestions. In brief, 50 μl of 1 m bicarbonate were added to 0.5 ml of 2 mg of protein/ml HDL in PBS and the mixture was then transferred to a vial of reactive dye (Alexa 488 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester, dilithium salt). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature before the reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of hydroxylamine. The labeled HDL was separated from the free dye by exclusion chromatography using the column supplied by the manufacturer. Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Alexa 488, which was expected to react with primary amines of proteins (Molecular Probes, Alexa 488 Protein Labeling Kit Manual, catalog number A-10235), primarily covalently labeled the two major apolipoproteins on the surface of HDL, apoA-I and apoA-II (27.Assman G. von Eckardstein A.

Zanni E.E. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1993; 21: 145-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, in DiI-HDL the DiI associated with the HDL particles but had not covalently labeled the apolipoproteins (not shown). The human CD36 (hCD36) expression vector (29.Oquendo P. Hundt E. Lawler J. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 58: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) was the generous gift of B. Seed (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston). All of the expression vectors for mSR-BI were based on pCDNA1 (Invitrogen). Wild-type mSR-BI expression vectors used for these studies included pmSR-BI number 77 (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) and minor variants (e.g. ex47 and ex68) 2X. Gu, R. Lawrence, and M. Krieger, unpublished data. involving small differences in the linker region to facilitate cloning and restriction digestion. CHO cells were grown or incubated in medium A (Ham's F-12 containing 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine) supplemented with serum or other additions as indicated. PCR-based random mutagenesis was performed under two different conditions according to the protocols by Leunget al. (30.Leung D. Chen E. Goeddel D. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar) and Cadwell et al. (31.Cadwell C.R. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Under the first condition (30.Leung D. Chen E. Goeddel D. Technique. 1989; 1: 11-15Google Scholar), the reaction mixture contained 1 mm dGTP, 1 mm dCTP, 1 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.5 mmMnCl2, and 5.5 mm MgCl2. pmSR-BI number 77 (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) containing the wild-type mSR-BI was used as the template. Primers XG65 (5′-GGAAGATCTCCGTCTCCTTCAGGTCCTGAGC-3′) and XG66 (5′-TTATCGTCGACGCGTGGGCATCCATGTGCCGT-3′) were used at a concentration of 500 pmol/ml. Under the second condition, 0.2 mm dGTP was used in order to reduce the bias for A/T > G/C change (31.Cadwell C.R. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Amplification was performed on a Perkin-Elmer DNA cycler: initial denaturation (94 °C for 4 min) followed by 40 cycles of annealing (50 °C for 1 min), elongation (72 °C for 2 min), and denaturation (94 °C for 1 min). The PCR products from 25 replicate tubes of each PCR under both conditions were pooled together to generate the collection of mutated 1.7-kb products used to construct the mutant library. Plasmid pMX-mSR-BI was generated by blunt-end ligating the HindIII/XbaI fragment of pmSR-BI′ (12.Gu X. Trigatti B. Xu S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) which contains the coding sequence of the wild-type mSR-BI into theNotI/EcoRI site of the pMX vector (32.Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For generating the Sub4 mutant library, the 1.7-kb fragments generated by error-prone PCR were digested with BlpI/SalI and cloned into the corresponding position in pMX-mSR-BI. Plasmids were isolated from pooled Escherichia coli colonies without further amplification. Retroviruses were generated in the Phoenix packaging cell line (ATCC SD 3444, grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine) provided by G. Nolan (Stanford Medical Center) by transfecting the cells with the pMX-mSR-BI plasmid or the Sub4 plasmid library of the mSR-BI mutants using the calcium phosphate method (33.Chatterton J.E. Hirsch D. Schwartz J.J. Bickel P.E. Rosenberg R.D. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected 24 and 48 h after transfection, and either were used immediately to infect CHO[Eco] cells (see below) or were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C before use. Stable CHO[Eco] cell lines expressing the ecotropic retrovirus receptor (34.Albritton L.M. Tseng L. Scadden D. Cunningham J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 659-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) were generated by transfecting CHO cells with the plasmid pCB7-Eco (gift from H. Lodish, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA, Ref. 33.Chatterton J.E. Hirsch D. Schwartz J.J. Bickel P.E. Rosenberg R.D. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were selected in medium A containing 5% fetal bovine serum (medium B) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. Individual colonies were then tested for the expression of human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) after infection with a PLAP-expressing retrovirus construct (MSCV-PLAP, gift from D. Baltimore, Caltech, Pasadena, CA) and the clone which gave the highest infection rate was isolated. This clone, designated CHO[Eco], was used for subsequent studies to express retrovirally encoded mSR-BI proteins. For transduction, CHO[Eco] cells were set at 500,000 cells/100-mm dish in medium B on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transduced with 6 ml of medium B containing 6 μg/ml of the adjuvent Polybrene and retrovirus supernatants diluted (1:3 or 1:6) in this medium. After incubation for 24 h at 34 °C, the retrovirus containing medium was replaced with fresh medium B. On day 3, cells were harvested with trypsin, reset into two 100-mm dishes, and maintained in medium B without selection. On day 5, cells were processed for labeling with fluorescent lipoproteins and FACS (see below) or were harvested and stored frozen at −80 °C for future FACS screening. Cells transduced with retrovirus (see above) were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with DiI-HDL (5 μg of protein/ml) in medium A containing 0.5% (w/v) fatty acid free BSA (medium C). Cells were harvested with trypsin, the trypsin was quenched with medium B, and the cells were then washed once with medium C. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 10 μg of protein/ml Alexa-HDL in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Immediately before FACS analysis and sorting, the cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5% BSA. FACS analysis was performed with a Becton-Dickson FACStar instrument. ldlA[mSR-BI] cells (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) labeled separately with either DiI-HDL or Alexa-HDL were used to set the compensation of the instrument to correct the fluorescence signal spill-over between optical channels. Doubly labeled CHO[Eco] cell pools transduced with MX-mSR-BI virus at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) were used as a reference to set the region for collecting the DiI−/Alexa+cells. Cells showing low DiI/Alexa signal ratio (DiI−/Alexa+) were isolated, expanded, and subjected to additional rounds of fluorescence labeling, FACS analysis, and sorting. Genomic DNAs from the DiI−/Alexa+ CHO[Eco] cells were isolated (35.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.16-9.22Google Scholar) and the mutant mSR-BI transgenes were cloned using high fidelity Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technology) and primers MX1(5′-CCACCGCCCTCAAAGTAGACG-3′, upstream primer in the 5′-viral long terminal repeat region) and XG66 (downstream primer). The resulting 1.7-kb PCR fragments were digested withBglII/BstXI and cloned into theBamHI/BstXI sites in plasmid ex47. ThePstI/XbaI fragment of plasmid pmSR-BI number 77 (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar) was cloned into the PstI/XbaI site of pUC18 to generate plasmid VM1. To generate point mutations at amino acid position 418 (glutamine in the wild-type sequence), we amplified PCR fragments using wild-type mSR-BI as template and primers: P5 (5′-GTTCCTTCACAAAGATCCTC-3′) and XG-71(Q/K) (5′-CTGTGGTTCGAAAAGAGCGGAGCAATGGGTGGC-3′); P5 and XG-72(Q/E) (5′-CTGTGGTTCGAAGAGAGCGGAGCAATGGGTGGC-3′); P5 and XG-73(Q/A) (5′-CTGTGGTTCGAAGCTAGCGGAGCAATGGGTGGC-3′); P5 and XG-74(Q/L) (5′-CTGTGGTTCGAACTGAGCGGAGCAATGGGTGGC-3′). The amplified fragments were digested with SfuI and XbaI and cloned into theSfuI/XbaI site of plasmid VM1 to generate plasmids VM15, VM16, VM17, and VM18 respectively. TheBlpI/XbaI fragments from these four plasmids were then cloned into the corresponding sites of pmSR-BI number 77 to generate plasmids VM23 (Q418K), VM24 (Q418E), VM25 (Q418A), and VM26 (Q418L), each encodes a mSR-BI mutant with a single amino acid substitution at Gln418. To generate point mutations at amino acid position 402 (glutamine in the wild-type sequence), we amplified PCR fragments using wild-type mSR-BI as template and primers: P5 and XG-67(Q/K) (5′-ATGCAGCTGAGCCTCTACATCAAATCTGTCAAGGGCATCGGGAAGACAGGGAAGATCGAGCCAG-3′); P5 and XG-68(Q/E) (5′-ATGCAGCTGAGCCTCTACATCAAATCTGTCAAGGGCATCGGGGAGACGGGGAAGATCGAGCCAGTAG-3′); P5 and XG-69(Q/A) (5′-ATGCAGCTGAGCCTCTACATCAAATCTGTCAAGGGCATCGGGGCTACCGGGAAGATCGAGCCAGTAG-3′); P5 and XG-70(Q/L) (5′-ATGCAGCTGAGCCTCTACATCAAATCTGTCAAGGGCATCGGGTTAACCGGGAAGATCGAGCCAGTAG-3′). The amplified fragments were digested with BlpI andXbaI and cloned into the corresponding site in pmSR-BI number 77 to generate VM19 (Q402K), VM22 (Q402E), VM20 (Q402A), and VM21 (Q402L), each encodes a mSR-BI mutant with a single amino acid substitution at Gln402. To generate the double mutant with Q402R/Q418R, we cloned theXbaI/FspI fragment from plasmid pmSR-BI number 77 into the corresponding site of plasmid M4-D (see “Results”) to generate plasmid VM12′. The XbaI/BlpI fragment from VM12′ was then cloned into the corresponding site in plasmid ex68 to generate plasmid VM54, which encodes the mSR-BI mutant with the Q402R/Q418R double mutation. All the site-specific mutations mentioned above were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells grown in 6-well dishes were labeled with 1 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5% BSA and rabbit polyclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of mSR-BI (1:1000 dilution, generous gift from K. Kozarsky) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and labeled with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution, Cappel, West Chester, PA) in 1 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 2 mm EDTA. After 20 min, cells were detached from the plastic by gentle pipetting and incubated at room temperature for another 20 min. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 0.5% BSA and subjected to fluorescence flow cytometric analysis. The mean value of the fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of mSR-BI surface expression. Cells were maintained in medium A containing 5% newborn calf lipoprotein-deficient serum (NC-LPDS, medium D) for at least 2 weeks before the ACAT assay to prevent differential buildup of intracellular cholesterol in cells expressing different lipoprotein receptors. Cells were set in 6-well dishes at 80,000 cell/well on day 0 in medium D and refed with the same medium on day 2. On day 3, cells were washed twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and refed with 1 ml of medium C containing the indicated amounts of either HDL or LDL. After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl (100 nmol) of [3H]oleate/BSA mixture (21,804 dpm/nmol, a gift from Dr. L. Liscum, Tufts University, Ref. 36.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar) was added to each well. After incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold Tris wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2 mg/ml BSA, followed by two quick washes with Tris wash buffer without BSA. Two ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2) were then added to each well. After 15 min of shaking at room temperature, 10 μl of recovery standard (2 mg/ml cholesterol oleate, 1 mg/ml triolein, 50 μCi/ml cholesterol [14C]oleate in chloroform/methanol (2:1)) were added to each well. The plates were shaken for another 15 min before the organic extracts were transferred to 12 × 75-mm glass tubes. Cells were extracted with addition of another 1 ml of hexane/isopropyl alcohol and the extracts were pooled and dried under nitrogen gas. Samples were then dissolved in 50 μl of chloroform and separated by silica gel thin layer chromatography (developed with heptane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (90:30:1)). The cholesteryl esters were visualized by staining with iodine vapor and cut away from the silica gel plates (Silica Gel 60, Fisher Scientific). The amounts of cholesteryl [3H]oleate formed were measured using a Tri-carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard).

McKay R.D.G. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several strategies have been devised to isolate neural cell lines, including cloning of tumors, targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice, somatic cell fusion, growth factor-mediated expansion of progenitors of the central nervous system, as well as retroviral immortalization (2.Whittemore S.R. Snyder E.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 13-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Among these cell lines, of outstanding interest are those that retain pluripotent differentiative capacities, such as neuron-glia precursor cells (reviewed in Ref. 2.Whittemore S.R. Snyder E.Y. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 13-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the processes underlying phenotypic choices may be studied with these precursor cells, the initial events of neurogenesis remain largely unknown because it is still impracticable to establish neuroepithelial stem cell lines immediately after gastrulation. Multipotential embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells may be used to overcome this limitation and have already provided in vitro models for neuronal differentiation (3.Liesi P. Rechardt L. Wartiovaara J. Nature. 1983; 306: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4.Bain G. Kitchens D. Yao M. Huettner J.E. Gottlieb D.I. Dev.

Neurol. 1998; 149: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For instance, the embryonal carcinoma-derived P19 cell line yields various types of neurons as well as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia after treatment with retinoic acid (6.McPherson P.A. McBurney M.W. Methods: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 238-252Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Such cell systems can be used to follow the differentiation pathway leading from the multipotential stem cell state to a terminally differentiated neural phenotype. However, molecular studies are hindered by the heterogeneity of differentiation, as no clear-cut switch from one phenotype to another can be triggered in response to extracellular signals.In an attempt to isolate early committed progenitor cells able to homogeneously differentiate toward alternative fates after appropriatein vitro induction, we introduced the PK4 plasmid, which contains the early genes of the simian virus SV40 under the control of the adenovirus E1A promoter, into multipotential cells (7.Kellermann O. Kelly F. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Due to the low level constitutive expression of the SV40 T antigen, this construct promotes immortalization of neuroectodermal, endodermal, or mesodermal precursor cell lines while still allowing differentiation along multiple pathways to occur (8.Buc-Caron M.H.

Kelly F. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), behaves as a neuronal progenitor. It maintains an undifferentiated phenotype and responds to induction by producing a progeny with neuron-associated markers. 1C11 cells convert within 4 days into serotonergic cells able to metabolize, store, and take up serotonin (5-HT)1 (8.Buc-Caron M.H.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 458-466PubMed Google Scholar) and expressing 5-HT1B/D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2B receptors (11.Kellermann O. Loric S. Maroteaux L. Launay J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1161-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Additional experiments shown here establish that the selective induction of these three 5-HT receptors is an essential part of the serotonergic program. Indeed, the cells synthesis, storage, and transport of 5-HT respond to 5-HT concentration in the growth medium. The present study also introduces alternative culture conditions capable of triggering the 1C11 clone toward catecholaminergic differentiation. Similar to the serotonergic program, the catecholaminergic pathway recruits nearly 100% of the cells and follows a well defined schedule. Although the enzymes of catecholaminergic metabolism are fully acquired within 4 days, 12 days of induction are necessary for the cells to display a complete catecholaminergic phenotype, coincident with the induction of a functional norepinephrine (NE) uptake. Screening differentiating catecholaminergic cells to detect bioaminergic receptors revealed the onset of a single adrenergic receptor subtype, α1D, at day 8 of differentiation. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the implementation of the catecholaminergic program, since its inhibition prevents the cells from acquiring a functional NE transport.DISCUSSIONThe 1C11 cell line was already shown to produce serotonergic cells upon differentiation (8.Buc-Caron M.H. Launay J.M. Lamblin D. Kellermann O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the 1C11 cell actually is a bipotential neuroectodermal progenitor able to also convert into fully functional catecholaminergic cells. This report also emphasizes that the receptors selectively induced along either differentiation pathway actively participate to the implementation of the corresponding phenotype.1C11 Behaves as a Committed Neuroectodermal ProgenitorAs expected for a genuine progenitor, the 1C11 clone can give rise to differentiated progenies upon induction. The resulting daughter cells progressively acquire either a complete serotonergic or catecholaminergic phenotype. The sequential steps of the mutually exclusive differentiation programs of the 1C11 cell line are summarized on Fig. 3. The differentiation events concern almost 100% of the cells and are synchronous within the cell population, as monitored by the immunolabeling of neuronal- or neurotransmitter-specific markers.The 1C11 cell line initially resulted from the direct inductionin vitro of F9-PK4 multipotential cells by retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP (7.Kellermann O. Kelly F. Differentiation. 1986; 32: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of a proper embryonal environment, 1C11 cells appear to have been irreversibly committed toward a neural fate. Neuroectodermal cell fate decision is influenced by a variety of signals, either endogenous, such as developmentally expressed bioamines (20.Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and neurotrophins, or exogenous, originating from the somites and the notochord (21.Bronner-Fraser M. Fraser S.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Among the complex network of pathways that dictates the developmental choice of neural progenitors, the Notch signaling pathway is of critical importance (16.Fleming R.J. Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 437-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The combined expression of Notch-1 and Jagged-1 in 1C11 cells and the homogenous immunostaining of the cell nuclei with Notch-1 antibodies suggest that Notch-ligand interactions may take part in determining the fate of 1C11 cells. Finally, the expression of the early neuroectodermal marker nestin together with the lack of expression of neuronal functions indicate that the 1C11 clone may correspond to a neuroepithelial precursor.1C11 Catecholaminergic DifferentiationThe PC12 cell line and the MAH sympathoadrenal progenitor (22.Birren S.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1990; 4: 189-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have already enabled the study of several features of the catecholaminergic differentiation. In particular, PC12 cells express a phenotype of transformed chromaffin cells and respond to nerve growth factor by adopting a neuron-like fate, with a switch from the adrenergic to a cholinergic phenotype (23.Green S.H. Methods: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 222-237Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 1C11 clone provides another, yet different, model for catecholaminergic differentiation. In contrast to the adrenergic cells of the peripheral nervous system or adrenal medulla, 1C11**/NE cells lack phenylethanolamineN-methyltransferase enzymatic activity.The 1C11 catecholaminergic program was triggered by the synergistic effect of Bt2cAMP and Me2SO, whereas the serotonergic program was obtained with Bt2cAMP alone. Me2SO therefore acts as a dominant epigenetic signal. Such an effect of Me2SO can be related to that described in the case of Friend erythroleukemia cells (24.Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) and of NIE-115 neuroblastoma cells (25.Kihmi Y. Palfrey C. Spector I. Barak Y. Littauer U.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), where Me2SO confers a neuronal morphology.The catecholaminergic program is restricted to the induction of (i) the catecholamine metabolism, (ii) an adrenoreceptor, and (iii) NE uptake. Several features of differentiation are reminiscent of the in vivo situation. Similarly to the noradrenergic neurons of the brainstem (26.McQueen J.K. Basic Clin. Aspects Neurosci. 1987; 2: 7-16Crossref Google Scholar), 1C11**/NE cells have more robust but shorter neuritic processes than 1C11*/5HT cells. Asin vivo (18.Jonakait G.M. Markey K.A. Goldstein M. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 6-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the synthesis of catecholamines occurs before NE uptake. Eventually, like noradrenergic neurons, 1C11**/NE cells express the NET but no DA transporter (27.Lorang D. Amara S.G. Simerly R.B. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1C11**/NE noradrenergic cells selectively acquire a functional α1D-adrenoreceptor at day 8 of differentiation. Although it appears not to be implied in the catecholaminergic metabolism, this receptor is involved in the completion of the phenotype. From our various observations, we may draw a link between the induction of a constitutive activity for the receptor at day 10 and the NET regulation. Indeed, inactivation of the receptor at day 8 impairs (i) NE transport and nisoxetine binding at day 12 and (ii) the onset of a constitutive PLC coupling to the receptor at day 10. None of these effects are observed if the antagonist treatment is applied at day 10.Since these observations could be gained in culture medium deprived of exogenous catecholamines, we may propose that the acquisition by the receptor of its constitutive signaling activity is sustained by NE secreted by the cell itself. It is likely that 1C11**/NEcells produce NE as soon as day 4, when NE metabolism is implemented. A possible hypothesis is that small granular pulses of catecholamines, the existence of which we are currently testing by fast scan cyclic voltammetry, may account for NE release. Whatever the origin of the release, endogenous NE and the ensuing autocrine stimulation of the α1D-adrenoreceptor appear sufficient to allow the onset of a functional NE transport. Indeed, the kinetics of induction and the parameters of NE transport at day 12 are not improved by prior addition of NE in the culture medium at day 8 or 10.The role of α1D receptors in vivo is unclear. The present discovery that an adrenoreceptor may act as an autoreceptor interfering with the onset of the NE transporter is unprecedented, yet NE binding to α-adrenoreceptors has already been suggested to be involved in the differentiation of amphibian embryonic neurons (28.Rowe S.J. Messenger N.J. Warner A.E. Development. 1993; 119: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1C11 Cells and Serotonergic DifferentiationThe availability of cellular models exhibiting a complete serotonergic phenotype,i.e. 5-HT metabolism, storage, uptake, and receptors, is of general interest in view of the involvement of serotonergic neurons in many behavioral and homeostatic processes. The few cell lines meeting these criteria include the thyroid parafollicular cell system (29.Russo A.F. Clark M.S. Durham P.L. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 13: 257-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the embryonic raphe-derived RN46A cell line (30.Rudge J.S. Eaton M.J. Mather P. Lindsay R.M. Whittemore S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 604-621Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Despite their ability to undergo differentiation after induction, these systems already display functional serotonergic properties in the undifferentiated state. In contrast, serotonergic-related functions cannot be detected in the 1C11 progenitor.The time schedule enabling the acquisition of serotonergic functions by 1C11*/5HT cells is consistent with in vivoobservations. The phenotype reaches completion within 4 days, and the expression of a functional 5-HT transport takes place only after the induction of tryptophan hydroxylase activity (Table III). In the rat, the ontogeny of central serotonergic neurons, originating in the raphe nuclei, also occurs within a window of 4 days, between day 11 and day 15 of embryogenesis. At day 13, neurotransmitter synthesis becomes measurable and monoamine transporters cannot be detected before day 15 (31.Hyde C.E. Bennett B.A. Brain Res. 1994; 646: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In the present study, the intensities of 5-HT synthesis, storage, and uptake are shown to be down-regulated by 5-HT itself through the 5-HT2B and/or 5-HT1B/D receptors already present on the cells at day 2. The cells become responsive to external 5-HT at day 2 when the onset of 5-HT2B and 5-HT1B/D receptors occurs. This day therefore appears to be a critical commitment step within the 1C11 serotonergic program. The two receptors are still functional at day 4, when 5-HT2Areceptors become expressed. Likely all these receptors can mediate the effect of 5-HT in the coordination of the serotonergic functions underlying a complete phenotype of the cells. In fact, 5-HT1B/D receptors have already been proposed to behave as autoreceptors capable of modulating serotonergic neurotransmission (32.Hoyer D. Clarke D.E. Fozard J.R. Hartig P.R. Martin G.R. Mylecharane E.J. Saxena P.R. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 157-203PubMed Google Scholar). Our unpublished data suggest that the 5-HT2B receptor may also act as an autoreceptor, as it controls the overall 5-HT transport system of 1C11*/5HT cells.Concluding RemarksThe 1C11-inducible cell line provides an example of how the autonomous genetic program of a precursor cell can lead to the progressive acquisition of neuronal- and neurotransmitter-related functions up to a complete and autoregulated phenotype. Although it has never been clearly established that serotonergic and noradrenergic cells may share a common precursor in the course of embryonic development, the dual bioaminergic fate of 1C11 cells is in line with two very recent reports (5.Deacon T. Dinsmore J. Costantini L.C. Ratliff J. Isacson O. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 149: 28-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33.Ye W. Shimamura K. Rubenstein J.L.R. Hynes M.A. Rosenthal A. Cell. 1998; 93: 755-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), which suggest that central dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons indeed arise from a common progenitor. The consistency of the 1C11 differentiation programs lies on (i) the 100% phenotypic conversion, (ii) the implementation of all functions specific to serotonergic or noradrenergic neurons, in a mutually exclusive manner, (iii) the temporal orders of onset of neurotransmitter-related features that are similar to those observedin vivo, (iv) the selective induction of bioaminergic receptors along either pathway, sustaining the autoregulation of the corresponding phenotype. Hopefully the 1C11 system may, in view of these key properties, help gain insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the modulation of neuronal differentiation by neurotransmitters. Immortal cell lines expressing precursor properties and still capable of undergoing neuronal lineage transition may help identify the molecular and cellular events involved in neural differentiation and may help assess the relative contributions of the extrinsic and intrinsic factors involved in the fate of neuronal precursor cells (1.Lendahl U. McKay R.D.G. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 132-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several strategies have been devised to isolate neural cell lines, including cloning of tumors, targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice, somatic cell fusion, growth factor-mediated expansion of progenitors of the central nervous system, as well as retroviral immortalization (2.Whittemore S.R.

Methods: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 7: 222-237Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 1C11 clone provides another, yet different, model for catecholaminergic differentiation. In contrast to the adrenergic cells of the peripheral nervous system or adrenal medulla, 1C11**/NE cells lack phenylethanolamineN-methyltransferase enzymatic activity.The 1C11 catecholaminergic program was triggered by the synergistic effect of Bt2cAMP and Me2SO, whereas the serotonergic program was obtained with Bt2cAMP alone. Me2SO therefore acts as a dominant epigenetic signal. Such an effect of Me2SO can be related to that described in the case of Friend erythroleukemia cells (24.Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T.

Insulin stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene product (1.Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation requires the expression of a novel protein called CAP,1 which recruits c-Cbl to the insulin receptor (2.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CAP is a multifunctional protein with three adjacent SH3 domains in the C terminus and a sorbin homology domain in the N terminus. CAP associates with both c-Cbl and the insulin receptor in the basal state. Insulin stimulation causes the disassociation of CAP from the insulin receptor. However, CAP remains associated with c-Cbl after insulin stimulation. Additionally, overexpression of CAP causes the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers due to its association with p125FAK and actin stress fibers (3.Ribon V. Herrera R. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4073-4080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the role of CAP in insulin action has not been definitively proven, several lines of evidence suggest an important function. It is expressed predominantly in insulin-sensitive tissues. In the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell line, CAP expression correlates well with insulin sensitivity (2.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, stimulation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes or in diabetic rodents leads to increased CAP expression and increased insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation (4.Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14751-14756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The effects of TZDs on CAP expression are a direct result of increased transcription of theCAP gene. This TZD-induced increase in expression of CAP correlates well with increased insulin sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo (4.Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14751-14756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These results provide the first line of evidence linking the anti-diabetic effects of TZDs to improvements in insulin signaling. Furthermore, it is suggested that the CAP promoter may have elements that directly bind PPARγ. We report here the cloning of the promoter of the CAP gene and the identification of a functional PPAR response element (PPRE) within the CAP promoter. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. BRL 49653 (rosiglitazone) was synthesized by the Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division of Warner-Lambert Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The bacterial artificial chromosome library at Research Genetics was screened with the 5′-end of the coding region of the CAPgene. The bacterial artificial chromosome clone was restriction digested with HindIII or SacI and subject to sequential Southern analysis with probes corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region and the putative promoter sequence of theCAP gene. The fragments were subcloned and assembled in both pBluescript (Stratagene) and pGL3 basic (Promega). All sequence analyses of the putative promoter region and putative transcription factor binding sites were done with Signal Scan software (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). Plasmid constructs were generated by digestion using restriction sites within the CAP promoter. pCPH was generated by cloning a 550-base pair HindIII andSmaI fragment of the CAP promoter into pGL3. pCPS was generated by insertion of a 1070-base pair SacI andSmaI fragment into pGL3. pCPE was generated by insertion of the 2.6-kilobase EcoRI/SmaI fragment of the CAP promoter into pGL3. pCPEΔPPRE was generated by digestion of pCPE withSacI and removal of a 435-base pair fragment that contains the PPRE of the CAP promoter and ligation of the pCPE vector. Total RNA (40 μg) isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes or mouse fat tissue was hybridized with a γ-32P-end-labeled 70-mer probe overnight at 42 °C. The antisense 70-mer probe contains a sequence complimentary to the first 40 bases of the 5′-end of the longest CAP cDNA clone, a sequence complimentary to the 20-base genomic sequences immediately upstream of the 5′-end of the longest clone, and a 10-base nonspecific sequence (see Fig. 3 B). The samples were then digested with 250 units of S1 nuclease at 37 °C for 60 min, followed by ethanol precipitation. The reaction products were subjected to polyacrylamide (8%)/urea (7 m) gel elecrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Undigested probe was loaded on lane 1 (see Fig. 2). The size of the protected fragment was estimated by comparison with a DNA sequencing ladder run on the same gel.Figure 2S1 nuclease analysis of the transcription initiation site of the CAP gene.

Transfections of NIH3T3 fibroblasts were done by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 250 ng of pGL3 basic firefly luciferase constructs (Promega) were co-transfected with 50 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase and/or CMV-PPARγ and CMV-RXRα. PPARγ1 and RXRα were cloned into the pSG5 expression plasmid as described previously (5.Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Five h after transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 20 μm rosiglitazone. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown to confluence and differentiated as described previously (6.Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20801-20807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Adipocytes (day 8 after differentiation) were electroporated using a protocol reported previously by Thurmond et al. (7.Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. 107 adipocytes were electroporated with 100 μg of the pGL3-based reporter construct and 25 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase. Adipocytes were electroporated in a Bio-Rad Genepulser at 0.16 kV and 950 microfarad capacitance. 107 electroporated adipocytes were then replated onto collagen-coated 24-well tissue culture plates in complete media. After replating and adherence, adipocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μm rosiglitazone for 30 h. All cells were then lysed, and luciferase activity was measured by dual light luciferase assay (Tropix Inc., New Bedford, MA). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase luminescence. cDNAs for murinePPARγ and murineRXRα were in vitro translated using the TNT Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Translation products were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 5 μl of each TNT reaction were used for the mobility shift assay. In vitro translated murinePPARγ and murineRXRα were co-incubated on ice for 30 min before the addition of radiolabeled (50,000 cpm/sample) double-stranded probe. 10 μg of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte and adipocyte nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (8.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar), except that the extracts were not dialyzed but were added directly to the binding reaction, containing radiolabeled (50,000 cpm/sample) double-stranded probe, for 15 min at room temperature. Complexes were resolved by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were used for shift and competition analysis: (a) wtPPRE, 5′-CTGACACAGGCTAAAGGTCATCTGAAGAAG-3′; (b) mutPPPRE, 5′-CTGACACAGGCTAAGGTCATCTGAGGAGGA3′; and (c) nonspecific CAP promoter DNA, 5′-CTGTATCAGCTTCTTGACTCCTGCCCT-3′. Southern analysis and sequencing of fragments from a bacterial artificial chromosome clone containing the 5′-flanking region of the CAP gene revealed a structure depicted in Fig.1, A and B. To determine the start of transcription of the CAP gene, a 70-nucleotide single-stranded DNA probe was generated that overlapped a region containing the longest known CAP cDNA sequence. The probe was hybridized with 3T3-L1 adipocyte or mouse fat tissue mRNA and digested with S1 nuclease to identify the start of transcription (Figs.1 B and 2). The presence of one predominant transcript was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The start of translation of the CAP gene was found to lie within exon 4 of theCAP gene (data not shown). A putative promoter sequence was identified by analysis of 2.6 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region of the CAP gene using Signal Scan software (University of Minnesota). Although no TATA box was found within the promoter, it does possess the characteristics of a TATA-less promoter (9.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10.Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The basal promoter region is GC rich and contains multiple Sp-1 binding sites. Additionally, a CAAT box was identified as well as several activator protein-2 and C/EBP sites. The putative PPRE was found at −1085 to −1097 in the CAP promoter (Fig. 1 B). The CAP promoter PPRE has a sequence of direct repeats of a hexamer (DR1) type similar to the PPREs from other genes, as shown in TableI (11.Johnson E.F. Palmer C.N. Griffin K.J. Hsu M.H.

Open table in a new tab To determine the functionality of the CAP promoter as well as its putative PPRE, transient reporter assays using various CAP promoter constructs (Fig. 3 A) were performed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Luciferase fusion constructs were prepared by subcloning restriction fragments from the cloned CAP promoter into the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results obtained from reporter assays in NIH3T3 fibroblasts showed that the CAP promoter was functional (Fig.3 B). Fusion of the various CAP promoter constructs to the luciferase reporter produced a greater than 20-fold increase in luciferase activity, compared with the pGL3 basic vector alone, for all CAP promoter constructs tested (Fig. 3 B). Co-transfection of PPARγ and RXRα with the fusion construct pCPE containing the putative CAP PPRE led to an additional fold stimulation of luciferase activity. Addition of rosiglitazone led to an additional 2–3-fold stimulation of luciferase activity from the pCPE fusion construct. In contrast, the addition of PPARγ and RXRα, with or without rosiglitazone, was ineffective in increasing the luciferase activity of the shorter pCPH and pCPS fusion constructs. Additionally, deletion of the region containing the PPRE of the CAP promoter (fusion construct pCPEΔPPRE) abolished the response to rosiglitazone. To further characterize the activity of the CAP promoter and its PPRE, fusion constructs were electroporated into 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes contain high levels of endogenous PPARγ. Moreover, CAP expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is responsive to TZDs (4.Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14751-14756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Electroporated CAP reporter constructs pCPH and pCPS exhibited a 10-fold higher level of luciferase activity compared with pGL3 basic vector (Fig. 4). The pCPE construct containing the CAP PPRE produced an additional 2-fold stimulation of luciferase activity compared with pCPH. The activity of the pCPE fusion construct was 2-fold greater in the presence of 20 μmrosiglitazone. Deletion of the region of the CAP promoter containing the PPRE (pCPEΔPPRE) abolished both the increase in basal luciferase activity and the response to rosiglitazone. To demonstrate direct binding of PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers to the CAP PPRE, gel shift analysis with the CAP PPRE was performed (Fig. 5 A). A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe for wtCAP PPRE was end-labeled with32P and incubated with in vitro translated proteins as well as 3T3-L1 nuclear extracts. As shown in Fig.5 B, neither PPARγ nor RXRα alone bound to the CAP PPRE oligonucleotide. However, PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers bound to the wtCAP PPRE oligonucleotide. This binding is specific because it could be competed with unlabeled wtCAP PPRE oligonucleotide. Incubation with either mutCAP PPRE (an oligonucleotide with a single-base deletion in the DR1 motif) or a nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide did not displace the labeled wtCAP PPRE oligonucleotide. Furthermore, nuclear proteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes were able to form protein-DNA complexes with wtCAP PPRE with a specificity similar to that seen in the experiments done with the in vitro translated PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers (Fig. 5 C). As described above, unlabeled wtCAP PPRE competed for DNA-protein complexes that were formed with nuclear proteins. mutCAP PPRE and nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide probes did not compete with the radiolabeled DNA-protein interaction. Numerous studies in animal models and patients with type 2 diabetes have established a direct link between PPARγ activation by TZDs and insulin sensitivity (13.Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which TZDs improve insulin sensitivity remains uncertain. Most of the genes discovered to date that are PPAR-responsive primarily participate in lipid synthesis and/or clearance. Moreover, despite the profound improvement in insulin sensitivity observed after TZD treatment, few genes that play a role in insulin signaling are PPARγ-responsive. We recently demonstrated that the transcription of CAP is directly increased in response to TZDs in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in Zucker Fatty Rats (4.Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14751-14756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have extended and confirmed this finding with the cloning and characterization of the promoter of the CAP gene and its PPRE. Cloning of the 5′-flanking region of the CAP gene led to the characterization of its promoter. The CAP gene has one start site for transcription, as identified by S1 nuclease protection and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This start of transcription lies 362 nucleotides upstream of the identified start of translation of the CAP protein. Whereas the identified CAP promoter lacks a TATA box, it possesses characteristics of a TATA-less promoter, including a GC-rich proximal sequence, a CAAT box, and several binding sites for the transcription factor Sp-1, which has been shown to activate TATA-less promoters (9.Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10.Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Sp-1 has the ability to recruit cofactors, including TATA binding factors, which interact with transcription factor IID and initiate transcription. The CAP promoter also contains binding sites for the transcription factor activator protein-2 and several potential binding sites for the C/EBP family of transcription factors. C/EBP isoforms are expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, with C/EBPδ and C/EPBβ expressed in preadipocytes, and C/EBPα expressed in adipocytes (14.Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). These data compliment the known differentiation-dependent expression of theCAP gene in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (2.Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the CAP gene identified a PPRE of the DR1 type in the CAP gene. In reporter assays, the region of the CAP promoter containing the putative PPRE was necessary for the stimulation of luciferase activity by PPARγ activation. Additionally, gel shift analysis demonstrated specific and direct binding of the CAP PPRE to PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers. The protein-DNA complexes formed were sequence-specific for the CAP PPRE, as shown by competition analysis. Deletion of the spacing base of the DR1 motif in the CAP PPRE prevented binding competition with the CAP PPRE-PPARγ/RXRα complex. Taken together, these data indicate that TZD-stimulated CAP expression is mediated through direct binding of PPARγ to the CAP PPRE. We have previously reported that TZDs increase the expression of CAP both in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Zucker (fa/fa) diabetic rats. The increase in CAP expression leads to an increase in insulin-stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This observation established the first direct link between TZD-mediated increases in insulin sensitivity and insulin signal transduction. We establish here that one mechanism by which TZD induces CAP expression is through direct binding of activated PPARγ/RXRα heterodimers to a PPRE in the CAP promoter. These observations further support the role of the CAP/c-Cbl interaction in insulin action and the link between PPARγ activation and insulin sensitivity. Future studies on the precise role of the CAP/c-Cbl pathway will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanism by which PPARγ activators improve insulin sensitivity.

We also thank Dr. Todd Leff for helpful discussion during preparation of the manuscript."

These cells responded to RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-2 to mediate phospholipase C activation, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and exocytosis. Upon activation, CCR1 underwent phosphorylation and desensitization as measured by diminished GTPase stimulation and Ca2+mobilization. Alanine substitution of specific serine and threonine residues (S2 and S3) or truncation of the cytoplasmic tail (ΔCCR1) of CCR1 abolished receptor phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein activation but did not abolish desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization. S2, S3, and ΔCCR1 were also resistant to internalization, mediated greater phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and sustained Ca2+ mobilization, and were only partially desensitized by RANTES, relative to S1 and CCR1. To study CCR1 cross-regulation, RBL cells co-expressing CCR1 and receptors for interleukin-8 (CXCR1, CXCR2, or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2, 331T) were produced. Interleukin-8 stimulation of CXCR1 or CXCR2 cross-phosphorylated CCR1 and cross-desensitized its ability to stimulate GTPase activity and Ca2+ mobilization. Interestingly, CCR1 cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized CXCR2, but not CXCR1. Ca2+ mobilization by S3 and ΔCCR1 were also cross-desensitized by CXCR1 and CXCR2 despite lack of receptor phosphorylation. In contrast to wild type CCR1, S3 and ΔCCR1, which produced sustained signals, cross-phosphorylated and cross-desensitized responses to CXCR1 as well as CXCR2. Taken together, these results indicate that CCR1-mediated responses are regulated at several steps in the signaling pathway, by receptor phosphorylation at the level of receptor/G protein coupling and by an unknown mechanism at the level of phospholipase C activation. Moreover selective cross-regulation among chemokine receptors is, in part, a consequence of the strength of signaling (i.e. greater phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and sustained Ca2+ mobilization) which is inversely corrolated with the receptor's susceptibility to phosphorylation. Since many chemokines activate multiple chemokine receptors, selective cross-regulation among such receptors may play a role in their immunomodulation.

Moreover selective cross-regulation among chemokine receptors is, in part, a consequence of the strength of signaling (i.e. greater phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and sustained Ca2+ mobilization) which is inversely corrolated with the receptor's susceptibility to phosphorylation. Since many chemokines activate multiple chemokine receptors, selective cross-regulation among such receptors may play a role in their immunomodulation. regulated upon activation normal T expressed and secreted macrophage inflammatory protein-1α monocyte chemotactic protein-2 formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine complement cleavage product RANTES receptor interleukin-8 IL-8 receptor A IL-8 receptor B phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate GTP-regulatory protein phospholipase C hemagglutinin 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′-cyclic monophosphate RANTES1 is a member of the CC subfamily of chemokines, which participate in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes (1.Schall T.J.

While much has been learned about the signaling pathways of chemokine receptors, little is known about their mechanism(s) of regulation or cross-regulation. Cellular responses to chemoattractants such as formyl peptides (fMLP), a complement cleavage product (C5a), interleukin-8 (IL-8), platelet-activating factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and leukotriene B4, are regulated via three forms of desensitization: 1) desensitization that involves receptor/G protein uncoupling via phosphorylation of the activated receptor by a receptor-specific kinase (GRK) (10.Tardif M.

This present work studied the mechanisms of regulation and cross-regulation of CCR1. For that purpose, an epitope-tagged CCR1 was expressed in a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line and studied for its ability to undergo phosphorylation and desensitization upon agonist stimulation. In addition, CCR1 was co-expressed with the receptors for IL-8 (CXCR1 and CXCR2), and its ability to undergo or mediate cross-desensitization was investigated. The results show that CCR1 is regulated via receptor phosphorylation as well as a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. In addition, the data demonstrated unexpected differences in the ability of CCR1 to cross-regulate cellular responses to CXCR1 and CXCR2. These differences likely reflect the disparate susceptibility of CXCR1 and CXCR2 to time-dependent receptor signals from CCR1. More broadly, these data suggest that cross-regulation among classes of chemoattractant receptors is dependent on the strength of receptor's signaling, which may be inversely correlated with the receptor's susceptibility to phosphorylation by second messenger dependent kinases. [32P]Orthophosphate (8500–9120 Ci/mmol), myo-[2-3H]inositol (24.4 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 125I-RANTES and125I-IL-8 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RANTES, IL-8 (monocyte-derived), MIP-1α, and MCP-2 were purchased from Genzyme. Geneticin (G418) and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal 12CA5 antibody, protein G-agarose and protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-human IL-8RB (CXCR2) antibody was purchased from PharMingen. Polyclonal antibody against PLCβ3 and anti-human IIL-8RA (CXCR1) antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester and pluronic acid were purchased from Molecular Probes. 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GDP, GTP, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents are from commercial sources. The cDNAs encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged CCR1 and the CXCR2 mutant 331T were kindly provided by Dr. Timothy N. C. Wells and Dr. Ann Richmond, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction was used to generate phosphorylation-deficient mutants of CCR1 (S1, S2, and S3) as well as a carboxyl-terminal truncated CCR1 mutant (ΔCCR1). The 5′ oligonucleotide corresponding to the epitope-tagged CCR1 (YPYDVPDYA) was used with a 3′ oligonucleotide complementary to the CCR1 tail replacing serine and threonine residues with alanine (S1, S2, and S3) or to the amino acids 325–331 in CCR1 following by a stop codon (ΔCCR1). The resulting polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, and the entire receptors were sequenced to confirm the intended mutations and lack of secondary mutations. RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (17.Ali H. Richardson M.R. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells (1 × 107 cells) were transfected by electroporation with pcDNA3 containing the receptor cDNAs (20 μg), and Geneticin-resistant cells were cloned into single cell by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis. For double transfectant, RBL cells stably expressing wild type CCR1 or the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant ΔCCR1 were electroporated with pRK5 plasmid containing either CXCR1 or CXCR2. The following day cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for cell surface expression of the receptors, using specific antibodies against the amino terminus of either CXCR1 or CXCR2. The top 3% of the cells expressing the receptors were subjected to two runs of sorting and then cloned into single cell. Cells expressing similar number of both receptors were used in this study. RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 24-well plates (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in growth medium. Cells were then rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated on ice for 2 h in the same medium (200 μl) containing the radiolabeled ligand (0.1 nm). Reactions were stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and washed three times with the same buffer. Cells were then lysed with 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and bound radioactivity was counted (18.Richardson R.M. Ali H. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

For internalization, cells were incubated with different ligands for 0–60 min. Then cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 125I-RANTES or 125I-IL-8 binding was carried out as described above. RBL-2H3 cells were subcultured overnight in 96-well culture plates (50,000 cells/well) in inositol-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 μCi/ml [3H]inositol. The generation of inositol phosphates was determined as reported (17.Ali H. Richardson M.R. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For calcium mobilization, cells (3 × 106) were removed, washed with HEPES-buffered saline, and loaded with 1 μmIndo I-AM in the presence of 1 μm pluronic acid for 30 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed and resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer. Intracellular calcium increase in the presence and absence of ligands was measured as described (17.Ali H. Richardson M.R. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of receptors or PLCβ3 was performed as described previously (17.Ali H.

RBL (5 × 106) expressing the receptors were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi/dish) for 90 min. Then labeled cells were stimulated with the indicated ligands for 5 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against either the NH2 terminus of CXCR1 or CXCR2; the HA epitope tag of CCR1 or the PLCβ3, analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cells were treated with appropriate concentrations of stimulants, and membranes were prepared as described previously (17.Ali H. Richardson M.R. Tomhave E. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPase activity using 10–20 μg of membrane preparations was carried out as described previously (18.Richardson R.M. Ali H.

Competition binding assays using 125I-RANTES (Fig. 1 A) and Scatchard analysis (data not shown) revealed that the CCR1 stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells bound RANTES with a dissociation constant (K d) of 12 ± 2 nm andB max of 7354 ± 462 receptors/cell. TheK d for RANTES binding in RBL-2H3 cells is similar to that of the CCR1 expressed in 293 cells 7.6 ± 1.5 nm(4.Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Activation of CCR1 by RANTES stimulated PI hydrolysis (Fig.1 B) and secretion (Fig. 1 D) in a dose-dependent manner in RBL-2H3 cells. The EC50 values for RANTES were 2.17 ± 0.25 nm and 3.3 ± 0.65 nm for PI hydrolysis and exocytosis, respectively. CCR1 mediated comparable peak intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to both RANTES and MIP-1α (Fig. 1 C). MCP-2-induced Ca2+mobilization was ∼50% less than RANTES and MIP-1α. No response was obtained with IL-8. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin completely inhibited the ability of all three ligands tested to stimulate PI hydrolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and secretion (data not shown). Ca2+mobilization was quantified to study desensitization of CCR1-mediated cellular responses in RBL. As shown in Fig.2, prestimulation of Indo-1-loaded RBL cells expressing CCR1 with an EC100 dose (for Ca2+ mobilization) of RANTES (10 nm), MIP-1α (10 nm), or MCP-2 (10 nm) markedly inhibited response to a second dose of RANTES. Desensitization by RANTES and MIP-1α was >90%, whereas MCP-2 pretreatment caused ∼50% desensitization. PMA (100 nm) and cpt-cAMP (1 mm) pretreatment of the cells completely inhibited RANTES-, MIP-1α-, and MCP-2-induced Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 2, data not shown). Pretreatment of CCR1-expressing RBL cells with either RANTES (100 nm) or PMA (100 nm) produced ∼60% desensitization of RANTES-mediated GTPase activity in membranes compared with control or untreated cells (Fig.3). In contrast to Ca2+mobilization (Fig. 2), pretreatment with cpt-cAMP (1 mm) had no effect on RANTES-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig. 3). RANTES (Fig.4 A, lane 2), MIP-1α (lane 5), and MCP-2 (lane 6) induced homologous phosphorylation of CCR1 (∼50 kDa). MCP-2-mediated phosphorylation was less than that of RANTES and MIP-1α. Heterologous phosphorylation by PMA (lane 3) was also lower (∼50% less) than that of RANTES and MIP-1α. No phosphorylation of CCR1 was detected with cpt-cAMP (lane 4). Homologous phosphorylation of CCR1 by RANTES (Fig. 4 B,lanes 3 and 4) or MCP-2 (lanes 5 and 6) was partially inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm). PMA-induced heterologous phosphorylation of CCR1 was totally blocked by staurosporine (lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that CCR1 is susceptible to phosphorylation by a GRK- and a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. It was determined whether CCR1-mediated cellular responses are regulated by cross-desensitization. Double transfectant RBL cells expressing CCR1 (7354 ± 462 receptors/cell) and the receptors for IL-8, CXCR1 (7009 ± 131 receptors/cell), CXCR1-CCR1, or CXCR2 (7452 ± 387 receptors/cell), CXCR2-CCR1, were constructed. TheK d for CXCR1 (1.19 ± 0.69 nm) and CXCR2 (3 ± 0.73 nm) in RBL co-expressing CCR1 were similar to that of RBL cells expressing single receptor (19.Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RANTES- and MIP-1α-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by CCR1 was cross-desensitized (∼65%) by CXCR1 or CXCR2 upon pretreatment of the cells with IL-8 (Table I). Pretreatment of the cells with a first dose of either RANTES or MIP-1α diminished Ca2+ mobilization by CXCR2 (∼35%). CXCR1 was not desensitized by CCR1. In cells expressing CCR1 and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CXCR2, 331T (331T-CCR1), IL-8-mediated Ca2+ mobilization was still cross-desensitized by RANTES and MIP1-α and vice versa (Table I).Table ICross-desensitization of CCR1-mediated Ca 2+ mobilization by the receptors for IL-8 CXCR1, CXCR2, and the CXCR2 mutant 331TCells/treatmentCa2+mobilizationCross-desensitizationnm%CXCR1-CCR1 IL-8 → RANTES686 ± 63 → 254 ± 1966 RANTES → IL-8768 ± 21 → 718 ± 47−5 IL-8 → MIP1α735 ± 34 → 260 ± 1062 MIP1α → IL-8697 ± 14 → 799 ± 23−8CXCR2-CCR1 IL-8 → RANTES562 ± 18 → 175 ± 767 RANTES → IL-8527 ± 34 → 362 ± 1335 IL-8 → MIP1α625 ± 26 → 178 ± 570 MIP1α → IL-8590 ± 14 → 412 ± 2134331T-CCR1 IL-8 → RANTES550 ± 27 → 128 ± 3675 RANTES → IL-8499 ± 32 → 386 ± 1030 IL-8 → MIP1α571 ± 25 → 174 ± 1967 MIP1α → IL-8530 ± 16 → 416 ± 927RBL-2H3 cells (5 × 106 cells/assay) expressing CXCR1-CCR1, CXCR2-CCR1, or 331T-CCR1 were loaded with Indo-1 and stimulated with RANTES (10 nm), MIP-1α (10 nm), or IL-8 (10 nm).

Cells were rechallenged 3 min later with a second dose of the indicated ligand, and peak intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was determined. Data are the means ± S.E. of three different experiments. Pretreatment of CXCR2-CCR1 cells with RANTES (100 nm) inhibited GTPase activity mediated by both RANTES (∼50%) and IL-8 (∼40%) in membrane (Fig. 5). IL-8 pretreatment also inhibited GTPase activity in response to both IL-8 (∼50%) and RANTES (∼40%). Pretreatment with IL-8 for 5 min caused ∼50% desensitization of IL-8-mediated GTPase activity in membranes, whereas ∼90% of CXCR2 are internalized after 1–2 min of exposure of the cells to IL-8 (Ref. 19.Richardson R.M.

Two factors may account for this difference: loss of phosphates group by part of the receptors during membrane preparation or recovery of internalized (i.e.non-desensitized) receptors from membranes vesicules.Figure 7Internalization of CCR1 in RBL cells.CXCR1-CCR1 or CXCR2-CCR1 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were incubated with either RANTES (100 nm) or IL-8 (100 nm) for 0–60 min.

The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated first with the 12CA5 antibody specific for the HA epitope tag expressed at the NH2terminus of CCR1 and then with specific antibodies directed against the NH2 terminus of CXCR1 or CXCR2 (20.Solari R. Offord R.E. Remy S. Aubry J.P. Wells T.N.C. Whitehorn E. Oung T. Proudfoot A.E.I. J. Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 9617-9620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CCR1 was homologously phosphorylated by RANTES (Fig. 6,A and B, lanes 5) and cross-phosphorylated upon stimulation by IL-8 of either CXCR1 (Fig.6 A, lane 6) or CXCR2 (Fig.6 B, lane 6). CXCR1 and CXCR2 were homologously phosphorylated by IL-8 (Fig. 6, A andB, lanes 3). CXCR2, but not CXCR1, was cross-phosphorylated by RANTES stimulation of CCR1 (Fig. 2, comparelane 2 in panel B withlane 2 in panel A). CCR1 undergo rapid receptor internalization (t ½ ∼7 min) upon exposure of either CXCR1-CCR1- or CXCR2-CCR1-expressing cells to 100 nm RANTES (Fig. 7,panels A and C). Maximum internalization was ∼90% after 60 min. RANTES had no effect on CXCR1 or CXCR2 (Fig. 7, panels B and D). IL-8 caused ∼65% and ∼95% internalization of CXCR1 and CXCR2, respectively (Fig. 7, panels B and D) but showed no significant decrease in 125I-RANTES binding to CCR1 on either CXCR1-CCR1 or CXCR2-CCR1 cells (Fig. 7,panels A and C). Despite inducing CCR1 cross-phosphorylation, treatment of double transfected cells with IL-8 did not cause CCR1 internalization, indicating cross-phosphorylation does not stimulate this process. In order to assess the role of phosphorylation in the desensitization CCR1, four receptor mutants lacking specific serine and threonine residues were constructed (TableII) and stably expressed into RBL-2H3 cells. Competition binding using 125I-RANTES and Scatchard analysis indicated that the pharmacological properties of the mutants are similar to that of the wild type CCR1 (TableIII). The differences inK d observed between the mutants and the wild type CCR1 (Table III) are not statistically significant (p> 0.05), as determined by paired test. Clones expressing similar receptor numbers (Table III) were utilized to determine the functional properties of the mutants CCR1 versus the wild type receptor. S2, S3, and ΔCCR1 were more active than CCR1 and S1 in mediating RANTES-induced PI hydrolysis (Fig. 8 A). Peaks of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to RANTES (10 nm) were similar for wild type and mutants CCR1 (Fig.8 B). However, a more sustained response was obtained with S2, S3, and ΔCCR1 as compared with CCR1 and S1. S2, S3, and ΔCCR1 were resistant to RANTES-induced receptor internalization, relative to CCR1 and S1 (Fig. 8 C).Table IIAmino acid sequences of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the wild type CCR1 and the serine and threonine residues either replaced with alanine or truncated in each mutants308 355 ↓ ↓C-tail CCR1 FRKYLRGLFHRRVAVHLVKWLPFLSVDRLERVSSTSPSTGEHELSAGFS1 FRKYLRGLFHRRVAVHLVKWLPFLSVDRLERVSSTSPSTGEHELAAGFS2 FRKYLRGLFHRRVAVHLVKWLPFLSVDRLERVAAAAPAAGEHELAAGFS3 FRKYLRGLFHRRVAVHLVKWLPFLAVDRLERVAAAAPAAGEHELAAGFΔCCR1 FRKYLRGLFHRRVAVHLVKWLPFLBold serine and threonine residues are potential phosphorylation sites in the wild type CCR1.

Ca2+mobilization in response to RANTES was desensitized by pretreatment of the cells to a first dose of RANTES (Fig. 9 B). However, S2, S3, and ΔCCR1 (∼67%, ∼59%, and 61%, respectively) were more resistant to desensitization than S1 and CCR1 (∼82% and 86%, respectively).

We have analyzed the evolutionary conservation of function(s) of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of these three sigma factors by in vitro transcription studies using heterologous transcription systems and by complementation assays usingEscherichia coli thermosensitive rpoD mutants. Our results indicate differences and similarities of the three plant factors and their prokaryotic ancestors. The functions of the N-terminal parts of the plant sigma factors are considerably different from the function of the N-terminal part of the principal sigma70 factor of E. coli. On the other hand, the C-terminal parts have kept at least two characteristics when compared with their prokaryotic ancestors: 1) they can distinguish between different promoter structures, and 2) one of them is capable of fully complementing E. coli rpoD mutants, i.e.recognizing all essential E. coli promoters that are used by the E. coli principal sigma70 factor. This shows for the first time in vivo a strong evolutionary conservation of cis- and trans-acting elements between the prokaryotic and the plant plastid transcriptional machinery.

However, the corresponding genes have not been cloned. Only recently, six different cDNAs showing strong sequence similarity with genes coding for prokaryotic-like sigma70-type initiation factors have been cloned and sequenced from Arabidopsis thaliana(accession numbers: SIG1, dbj: AB004820 and emb: Y15362; SIG2, dbj:AB004821 and emb: Y14567; SIG3, dbj: AB004822; SIG4, gb: AF101075; SIG5, emb: Y18550; and SIG6, emb: AJ250812). For three of them, it has been shown that the corresponding proteins are transported into the chloroplasts (9.Isono K. Shimizu M. Yoshimoto K. Niwa Y. Satoh K. Yokota A. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl.

In particular, it is not clear why several sigma70-type factors have been conserved during evolution, despite an important reduction of (plastid) genome size.Prokaryotic sigma factors can be classified into two families. Members of the first family are similar to the Escherichia colisigma70 factor, whereas members of the other family are similar to the E. coli sigma54 factor. The sigma70 family of transcription factors can be further subdivided into two or three groups. One primary sigma factor is required to ensure that “housekeeping functions” are performed, and alternative sigma factors direct transcriptional responses to changing environmental conditions (8.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Although both groups of sigma70 factors are similar with respect to their amino acid sequence, they recognize different sequences at the two promoter elements localized –10 and –35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start sites (reviewed in 8 and 15).In the present study, we attempted to obtain information about the evolutionary conservation of components of the transcriptional machinery between prokaryotes and higher plant plastids. With this aim, we analyzed differences of the three plant sigma factors with respect to promoter recognition by in vitro transcription, and we determined the plant analogue to the primary sigma factor ofE. coli by complementation of E. coli rpoD(ts) mutants. For the first time, we show in vivo complementation of a protein of the E. colitranscriptional machinery by a protein of the plastid transcriptional machinery.DISCUSSIONThree different cDNAs coding for potential plastid-localized sigma70-type transcription initiation factors have recently been cloned and sequenced from A. thaliana (9.Isono K.

Shinozaki K. Nagatani A. Wakasa K. Takahashi H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the existence of a multigene family of sigma factors has been suggested forZea mays (24.Tan S. Troxler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5316-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the list of Arabidopsissigma-like factors has been extended to six (SIG1– SIG6; see accession numbers listed above). Considering the small size of the plastid genome compared with that of bacteria or cyanobacteria, the existence of several sigma-like factors in plastids is quite surprising. It suggests that these factors might play different roles in plastid gene expression.The sigma70 transcription factor family is well characterized in prokaryotes such as E. coli and B. subtilis. It is subdivided into two (8.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) or three (25.Gruber T.M. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1734-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) groups including primary and alternative sigma factors. In the present study, we analyzed whether the two-group system has been conserved in higher plant plastids, i.e. whether a functional specialization might explain the existence of several sigma-like factors in photosynthetically active plastids. We have used in vitroand in vivo approaches to study the evolutionary conservation of components of the transcriptional machinery between prokaryotes and higher plant plastids and to characterize the function(s) of three of the six different plant plastid sigma-like factors. Expression and complementation studies (Figs. 1 and 4) of full-length and truncated plant plastid sigma polypeptides in E. coli indicate that the functions of the N-terminal parts of the plant sigma factors differ considerably from those of the corresponding portion of the principal sigma70 factor of E. coli. High level production of the full-length protein in E. coli was only achieved for SIG2. However, SIG2 does not activate transcription in a heterologous system with E. coli core enzyme (Fig. 2). This might explain why it was possible to produce this protein in high amounts in E. coli.To reveal and analyze specificity in promoter recognition of the three plant sigma-like factors, we used truncated polypeptides that harbor only the conserved regions 2–4. In this way, we avoid differences in promoter-RNA polymerase interactions that may arise from different functions of the different N-terminal sequences of these factors. In addition, it has been shown previously that the intact sigma70 factor of E. coli does not bind to DNA but that the cleavage of the N-terminal part of the factor transforms it into a DNA-binding protein (16.Dombroski A., J. Walter W.A. Record M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we supposed that it should be possible to reveal promoter specificity by using truncated sigma factors. We analyzed transcription factor-RNA polymerase-promoter interactions either by reconstitution of the truncated polypeptides with the E. coli core enzyme or by competition of the truncated polypeptides with the E. coli holoenzyme followed by in vitro transcription. These experiments clearly demonstrate differences in the recognition of three selected plastid promoters, rrn-P1, rrn-P2, and rbcL. SIG3 recognizes all three promoters, i.e. it is the least specific of the three regulatory proteins. SIG2 recognizes specifically the rrn-P1 promoter, and SIG1 recognizes only therbcL promoter (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). The analysis of several truncated SIG3 proteins shows that SIG3 might contain an inhibition domain that is similar to the pro sequence of B. subtilissigma K. However, we could not detect proteolytic cleavage of SIG3 inArabidopsis. Nevertheless, our experiments suggest a function of this domain in the regulation of SIG3 activity. Instead of proteolytic cleavage, the activity of SIG3 might be regulated by posttranslational conformational changes that modify the accessibility of this putative inhibition domain.If we compare the three plastid promoter structures with the consensus sequence recognized by the principal sigma70 factor ofE. coli, we find that the rbcL promoter has the highest similarity with the E. coli consensus (Fig.1 C). SIG1 recognizes specifically only the rbcL promoter, as analyzed by in vitro transcription, suggesting that SIG1 is the plant analogue to the primary sigma factor of E. coli. This hypothesis is further supported by the in vivo analysis of the hybrid sigma factors (Fig. 4). For this analysis, the N-terminal part of the E. coli primary ς70 factor (region 1) was fused to the different C-terminal parts of the three plant sigma factors (regions 2–4). Region 1 had been shown to be important for open and ternary complex formation (26.Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to induce conformational changes into the holoenzyme that are important for correct promoter recognition (27.Wilson Bowers C. Dombroski A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Parts of regions 2 and 4 are important for the recognition of consensus –10 and –35 DNA sequences (for review, see Ref. 8.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in promoter recognition and initiation of these hybrid sigma factors ought to be due to differences in the 3′ plant-specific part of the constructs. Results show that of the three tested hybrid sigma factors, only SIG1 fully complements the E. coli thermosensitiverpoD mutants.Our results indicate that the three higher plant plastid sigma70-like proteins have at least three characteristics in common with their prokaryotic ancestors: 1) they are composed of specific functional domains; 2) they distinguish between different promoter structures; and 3) only one of them (SIG1) is capable of recognizing all essential E. coli promoters that are recognized by the E. coli principal sigma70factor in vivo in E. coli. Therefore, we consider SIG1 to be the plant analogue to the primary sigma factor of E. coli. Interestingly, sequence alignment of all sixArabidopsis sigma factors to all five sigma factors localized on the Synechocystis genome (13.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) shows that SIG1 has the strongest sequence similarity and/or identity to all of the cyanobacterial sigma factors (Table I). Thus, SIG1 is the most prokaryotic-like plant sigma factor. The other plant sigma factors might have evolved in coordination with the transformation of a unicellular organism, the cyanobacterial ancestor, into an integrated part of a multicellular organism, the present-day plastid. The in vivo function of the SIG2-specificrrn-P1 promoter is still unclear (4.Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), 2S. Lerbs-Mache, unpublished results. and the activity of SIG3 might be regulated by posttranslational modification(s). Therefore, our results suggest specific functions for SIG2 and SIG3 that are related either to plant development and/or changes of environmental conditions. Experiments are in progress in our laboratory to analyze the function of the three plant sigma factors duringA. thaliana development using an antisense approach.Table IAmino acid sequence similarities and identities between cyanobacterial and plant ς factorsSyn1, orf sll2012; Syn2, ofr sll1689; Syn3, orf sll0306; Syn4, orf sll0184; Syn5, slr0653.

Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and to induce conformational changes into the holoenzyme that are important for correct promoter recognition (27.Wilson Bowers C. Dombroski A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Parts of regions 2 and 4 are important for the recognition of consensus –10 and –35 DNA sequences (for review, see Ref. 8.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Thus, differences in promoter recognition and initiation of these hybrid sigma factors ought to be due to differences in the 3′ plant-specific part of the constructs. Results show that of the three tested hybrid sigma factors, only SIG1 fully complements the E. coli thermosensitiverpoD mutants.Our results indicate that the three higher plant plastid sigma70-like proteins have at least three characteristics in common with their prokaryotic ancestors: 1) they are composed of specific functional domains; 2) they distinguish between different promoter structures; and 3) only one of them (SIG1) is capable of recognizing all essential E. coli promoters that are recognized by the E. coli principal sigma70factor in vivo in E. coli. Therefore, we consider SIG1 to be the plant analogue to the primary sigma factor of E. coli. Interestingly, sequence alignment of all sixArabidopsis sigma factors to all five sigma factors localized on the Synechocystis genome (13.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) shows that SIG1 has the strongest sequence similarity and/or identity to all of the cyanobacterial sigma factors (Table I). Thus, SIG1 is the most prokaryotic-like plant sigma factor. The other plant sigma factors might have evolved in coordination with the transformation of a unicellular organism, the cyanobacterial ancestor, into an integrated part of a multicellular organism, the present-day plastid. The in vivo function of the SIG2-specificrrn-P1 promoter is still unclear (4.Iratni R. Baeza L. Andreeva A. Mache R. Lerbs-Mache S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), 2S. Lerbs-Mache, unpublished results. and the activity of SIG3 might be regulated by posttranslational modification(s). Therefore, our results suggest specific functions for SIG2 and SIG3 that are related either to plant development and/or changes of environmental conditions. Experiments are in progress in our laboratory to analyze the function of the three plant sigma factors duringA. thaliana development using an antisense approach.Table IAmino acid sequence similarities and identities between cyanobacterial and plant ς factorsSyn1, orf sll2012; Syn2, ofr sll1689; Syn3, orf sll0306; Syn4, orf sll0184; Syn5, slr0653. Open table in a new tab Three different cDNAs coding for potential plastid-localized sigma70-type transcription initiation factors have recently been cloned and sequenced from A. thaliana (9.Isono K.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the existence of a multigene family of sigma factors has been suggested forZea mays (24.Tan S. Troxler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5316-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the list of Arabidopsissigma-like factors has been extended to six (SIG1– SIG6; see accession numbers listed above). Considering the small size of the plastid genome compared with that of bacteria or cyanobacteria, the existence of several sigma-like factors in plastids is quite surprising. It suggests that these factors might play different roles in plastid gene expression. The sigma70 transcription factor family is well characterized in prokaryotes such as E. coli and B. subtilis. It is subdivided into two (8.Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) or three (25.Gruber T.M. Bryant D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1734-1747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) groups including primary and alternative sigma factors. In the present study, we analyzed whether the two-group system has been conserved in higher plant plastids, i.e. whether a functional specialization might explain the existence of several sigma-like factors in photosynthetically active plastids. We have used in vitroand in vivo approaches to study the evolutionary conservation of components of the transcriptional machinery between prokaryotes and higher plant plastids and to characterize the function(s) of three of the six different plant plastid sigma-like factors. Expression and complementation studies (Figs. 1 and 4) of full-length and truncated plant plastid sigma polypeptides in E. coli indicate that the functions of the N-terminal parts of the plant sigma factors differ considerably from those of the corresponding portion of the principal sigma70 factor of E. coli. High level production of the full-length protein in E. coli was only achieved for SIG2. However, SIG2 does not activate transcription in a heterologous system with E. coli core enzyme (Fig. 2). This might explain why it was possible to produce this protein in high amounts in E. coli. To reveal and analyze specificity in promoter recognition of the three plant sigma-like factors, we used truncated polypeptides that harbor only the conserved regions 2–4. In this way, we avoid differences in promoter-RNA polymerase interactions that may arise from different functions of the different N-terminal sequences of these factors. In addition, it has been shown previously that the intact sigma70 factor of E. coli does not bind to DNA but that the cleavage of the N-terminal part of the factor transforms it into a DNA-binding protein (16.Dombroski A., J. Walter W.A. Record M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, we supposed that it should be possible to reveal promoter specificity by using truncated sigma factors. We analyzed transcription factor-RNA polymerase-promoter interactions either by reconstitution of the truncated polypeptides with the E. coli core enzyme or by competition of the truncated polypeptides with the E. coli holoenzyme followed by in vitro transcription. These experiments clearly demonstrate differences in the recognition of three selected plastid promoters, rrn-P1, rrn-P2, and rbcL. SIG3 recognizes all three promoters, i.e. it is the least specific of the three regulatory proteins. SIG2 recognizes specifically the rrn-P1 promoter, and SIG1 recognizes only therbcL promoter (Figs. 2, 3, and 6). The analysis of several truncated SIG3 proteins shows that SIG3 might contain an inhibition domain that is similar to the pro sequence of B. subtilissigma K. However, we could not detect proteolytic cleavage of SIG3 inArabidopsis. Nevertheless, our experiments suggest a function of this domain in the regulation of SIG3 activity. Instead of proteolytic cleavage, the activity of SIG3 might be regulated by posttranslational conformational changes that modify the accessibility of this putative inhibition domain. If we compare the three plastid promoter structures with the consensus sequence recognized by the principal sigma70 factor ofE. coli, we find that the rbcL promoter has the highest similarity with the E. coli consensus (Fig.1 C). SIG1 recognizes specifically only the rbcL promoter, as analyzed by in vitro transcription, suggesting that SIG1 is the plant analogue to the primary sigma factor of E. coli. This hypothesis is further supported by the in vivo analysis of the hybrid sigma factors (Fig. 4). For this analysis, the N-terminal part of the E. coli primary ς70 factor (region 1) was fused to the different C-terminal parts of the three plant sigma factors (regions 2–4). Region 1 had been shown to be important for open and ternary complex formation (26.Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol.

In this study, we determined if GM-CSF interacts with syndecans, a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Human primary osteoblasts were found to express syndecan-2 and -4 but few syndecan-1 transcripts and proteins. Recombinant human GM-CSF coupled to biotin was found to bind to syndecan-2. Immunocytochemical transmission electron microscope analysis showed co-localization of syndecan-2 and GM-CSF at the cell membrane surface. Syndecan-2 also co-localized at the cell surface and co-immunoprecipitated with the GM-CSF receptor α chain, suggesting a strong interaction between the cytokine, its receptor, and syndecan-2. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in syndecan-2 associated with the α chain of the GM-CSF receptor was increased after cell stimulation by GM-CSF. Antisense oligonucleotides that reduced specifically the expression of syndecan-2 inhibited the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 induced by the cytokine. Our results indicate functional interactions between syndecan-2 and GM-CSF in osteoblasts, and we propose that syndecan-2 plays a role as a co-receptor for this cytokine.

HSPGs can interact with many different ligands and thereby participate to cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation (1.Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13369-13372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among HSPGs expressed on the surface of most types of cells, syndecans form a family that includes four members, three of them (syndecan-1, -2, and -4) being cloned in human cells (2.Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrel S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 3.Marynen P. Zhang J. Cassiman J-J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Syndecans are expressed in cell-, tissue-, and development-specific patterns. In mineralized tissues, as in other mesenchymal tissues, syndecan-1 is only expressed transiently at particular stages of morphogenesis and cell differentiation (6.Bernfield, M., Hinkes, M. T., and Gallo, R. L. (1993) Development (suppl.) 205–212Google Scholar). For example syndecan-1 is expressed during mesenchymal condensation in the developing tooth (7.Thesleff I. Vaahtokari A. Partanen A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 35-50PubMed Google Scholar). In adult tissues, syndecan-1 is mainly expressed in epithelial cells (8.Hayashi K. Hayashi M. Jalkanen M. Firestone J.H. Trelstad R.I. Bernfield M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast, the major source of syndecan-2 appears to be mesenchymal cells. Notably, syndecan-2 occurs during mouse bone development and osteoblast differentiation and persists in differentiated hard tissues (9.David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van der Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndecan-3 was first identified in neural tissues but also seems to play a role in limb development (10.Kosher R.A. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 43: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 displays a more ubiquitous distribution in different tissues (11.Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar).These transmembrane PGs appear to display two main functions. One is to bind extracellular ligands such as matrix adhesive proteins, cell-cell adhesion molecules, enzymes, and growth factors (11.Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 12.Couchman J.R. Woods A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 578-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13.Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). All known ligand binding sites are localized on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains that syndecans bear on the extracellular domain of their core protein. These GAGs are mostly of the heparan sulfate type, although chondroitin sulfate chains could also be associated with syndecan-1 and -4 (11.Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). The second function of syndecans may be to promote signaling events that are associated with the ligand-dependent activation of high affinity receptors. For example, syndecans were found to stimulate fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1 occupancy and signaling by FGF (14.Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 133: 405-416Google Scholar). This may result from an increased availability of the ligand retained at the cell surface or from a more efficient presentation to the receptor (15.Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 16.Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Moreover, syndecans display a highly conserved intracytoplasmic domain that includes several phosphorylatable residues. This may indicate an important function of the cytoplasmic domain that may be kinase substrates. Indeed, syndecan-4 can be phosphorylated on a serine residue, this phosphorylation being regulated by the protein kinase C and a FGF-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase (17.Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10914-10918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cytoplasmic tail of syndecans was shown to be associated with molecules involved in intracellular signal transduction. Thus, the cytosolic part of syndecan-3 can bind a protein complex including Src family kinases and their substrates (18.Kinnumen T. Kaksonen M. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10702-10708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal FYA sequence of syndecans was reported to interact with syntenin, a PDZ protein (19.Grootjans J.J. Zimmermann P. Reekmans G. Smets A. Degeest G. Dürr J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Another PDZ domain-containing protein, the CASK/LIN-2, was found to bind the COOH-terminal motif of syndecan-2 (20.Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21.Hsueh Y. Yang F. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These proteins may connect syndecans to the cytoskeleton and different signaling pathways and allow them to participate to signaling events induced by PG ligands. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an heparin binding factor (22.Gordon M.Y. Riley G.P. Watt S.M. Greaves M.F. Nature. 1987; 326: 403-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 23.Alvarez-Silva M. Borojevic R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) implicated in the control of hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation (24.Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Baldwin G.C. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 352-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The biological activities of GM-CSF are mediated by a transmembrane high affinity receptor that is a heterodimeric complex composed of an α chain, which binds GM-CSF specifically with low affinity, and a β chain, which does not bind the cytokine but is essential for its signal transduction (24.Gasson J.C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both α and β chains are members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily and lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Signaling by GM-CSF depends on tyrosine kinases associated with the receptor, such as JAK2, which is associated with the β chain of the GM-CSF receptor (26.Gomez-Cambronero J. Veatch C. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Stimulation of GM-CSF-dependent cell lines with the cytokine has been found to induce a variety of immediate cellular responses including rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates, activation of components of the Ras signaling pathway such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and induction of early genes transcription (26.Gomez-Cambronero J. Veatch C. Life Sci. 1996; 59: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27.Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Drucker B.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the skeleton, GM-CSF is a potential regulator of bone cells. This hematological factor was found to be produced by different osteoblastic cell lines in response to stimuli (28.Horowitz M.C. Coleman D.L. Flood P.M. Kupper T.S. Jilka R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29.Felix R. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Guenther H.L. Fleisch H. Endocrinology. 1991; 126: 661-667Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Exogenous GM-CSF stimulates human osteoblast-like cell growth and antagonizes the induction by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D of osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase activity (30.Evans D.B. Bunning R.A.D. Russell R.G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We previously showed that GM-CSF is an autocrine growth factor for normal human osteoblastic cells (31.Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that GM-CSF not only binds to HSPG expressed at the osteoblastic cell surface but that the mitogenic activity of GM-CSF is dependent on the presence of fully sulfated PGs in these cells (32.Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that GM-CSF could be a ligand for syndecans that may be involved in the control of the mitogenic activity of the cytokine. In this study we therefore determined if GM-CSF is able to interact with syndecans in osteoblasts. Our results provide evidence for functional interactions between syndecan-2 and GM-CSF, and we propose that syndecan-2 may play a role as a co-receptor for this cytokine in osteoblastic cells.

Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van der Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9.David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van der Berghe H. Development. 1993; 119: 841-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the human common β chain receptor for interleukin-3, interleukin-5, and GM-CSF, and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-human GM-CSF α chain receptor. The secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG linked to colloidal gold particles (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which were enlarged by precipitation of metallic silver before microscopic visualization using an inverse condenser (Olympus BH-2). For transmission electron microscopy analysis, cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml rhGM-CSF for 5 min at 37 °C, then washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. A double immunostaining using mouse anti-syndecan-2 and polyclonal rabbit anti-GM-CSF or anti-GMRα was then performed. Labeling was revealed using anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies linked to 10-nm and 5-nm beads, respectively. After the immunological reaction, cells were post-fixed with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated in graded ethanol series, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (60–70 nm) were performed, treated with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed in transmission electron microscopy (Jeol 100 CXII) at high magnification. Isolated and coupled gold particles (total >1,000 particles) localized at the outer surface of the cells were counted. A protein fraction enriched in proteoglycans was obtained as described (35.Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). AHTO-7 cells were lysed in 4 m guanidine-HCl extraction solution (pH 6) containing 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m6-aminohexanoic acid, 20 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 2% Triton X-100. Extraction solution was then exchanged on Sephadex G-25 for a chromatography buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 7 murea, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 0.5 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2% Triton X-100). The protein extract was then deposited on a Q-Sepharose column (Hitrap). After washing with chromatography buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, proteoglycans were eluted with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The proteoglycan fraction was desalted, and the protein content was assayed by UV spectrophotometry. Biotin was linked to rhGM-CSF using a previously described method (36.Chiba S. Shibuya K. Miyazono K. Tojo A. Oka Y. Miyagawa K. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19777-19781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To do that, 10 μg of rhGM-CSF were reacted with 1 μg of NS-biotin in PBS at pH 8.3. The reaction was performed in the presence of 100 μg of heparin to protect potential heparin-binding sites on GM-CSF. At the end of the reaction, PBS containing 2 m NaCl was added to dissociate heparin from proteins, and rhGM-CSF linked to biotin (biotin-rhGM-CSF) was separated from free reagents on Sephadex G-25. Proteoglycans (0.2 mg/well) obtained as described above were subjected to 4–15% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was cut in different strips; one part was used for binding assay, and the other part for immunoblotting as described below, except that diaminobenzamidine was used as peroxidase substrate. Precise marks on the membrane allowed its reconstitution at the end of the experiments. Before the binding assay, strips of the membrane were digested at 37 °C with 10 milliunits/ml heparinase III or 33 milliunits /ml chondroitinase ABC diluted in Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (35.Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Digested and nondigested strips of the membrane were blocked for nonspecific binding in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 0.5% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature and then exposed to biotin-rhGM-CSF for 90 min at 37 °C. At the end of this incubation, after rapid washes, strips were reacted with avidin-peroxidase for 30 min. Recombinant hGM-CSF bound to proteoglycans on the membrane was revealed using diaminobenzamidine as peroxidase substrate. Confluent AHTO-7 cells were serum-starved for 24 h. The medium was then changed for Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were treated with rhGM-CSF for 0, 5, 10, or 30 min. The cells were then transferred onto ice, washed with PBS, and lysed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) with 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were clarified by incubation with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein content was then quantified. One mg of each protein extract was incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-GMRα or anti-syndecan-2 (10H4) and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, boiled 10 min in Tris containing 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, then resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed by incubating the membrane with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the secondary antibody. Signals were detected using a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The antisense oligomer (AS) used was complementary to the first 25 bases of the translation start site of rat syndecan-2 mRNA (37.Pierce A. Lyon M. Hampson I.N. Cowling G.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3894-3900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and had the following sequence: CCGGGGACGTGGCTCGTACCC. A random (R) oligonucleotide composed of the 25 randomly arranged bases of the AS was used as control and had the following sequence: AGTGCGGCGCCGCGTCTAGCC. The R sequence was checked on a computed data base not to be complementary to any known sequence. The oligonucleotides were protected from endonucleases by phosphorothioate modification at the 3′ end. Before oligonucleotide treatment, hOB cells were plated at 5,000 cells/cm2 in multiwell chambers and cultured for 2 days in the presence of 10% FCS to allow homogenous cell adhesion and with 30 mm sodium chlorate to reduce the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans at the cell surface (32.Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The medium was then changed for serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μm AS or R oligonucleotides or the diluent. After 2 days of culture in the presence of oligonucleotides, the medium was replaced, and the culture was continued for 3 days in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml rhGM-CSF or 1% FCS and in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml heparin. At the end of the culture, the cells were washed, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stained with hematoxylin, and the number of cells/cm2 was counted using an ocular integrator mounted on a microscope (Olympus, BH2). To ensure that AS affected only syndecan-2, the effect of AS and R oligonucleotides on the expression of syndecans was determined by immunocytochemistry in the same culture conditions as the cell proliferation assay. Cell cultures were cultured for 2 days in the presence of AS or R oligonucleotides and stopped before rhGM-CSF treatment, and immunocytochemistry of syndecan-1, -2, and -4 was performed as described above. The effect of syndecan-2 inhibition on the expression of GM-CSF receptor was also examined by immunochemistry in the same conditions. To assess that AS effectively reduced syndecan-2 levels, we used a quantitative method previously shown to be accurate in determining precise changes in protein levels under AS treatment (31.Modrowski D. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38.Machwate M. Julienne A. Moukhtar M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 187-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The number of cells expressing syndecan-2, GMRα, and GMRβ in the presence of AS or R oligonucleotides was counted in 3–4 wells, and the results were reported as % of total number of cells. The effect of syndecan-2 suppression on GM-CSF signaling was determined by examining the activation of MAPK induced by rhGM-CSF in the presence of oligonucleotides. AHTO-7 cells were treated for 2 days with 2 μm AS or R oligonucleotides in medium containing 1% FCS then stimulated for 10 min with 10 ng/ml rhGM-CSF and lysed onto ice. One-hundred μg of total protein extract were separated on SDS-PAGE, and activation of MAPK was determined by Western blot as described above using an affinity-purified rabbit IgG that recognizes the phosphorylated active form of the MAPK enzymes, ERK1 and ERK2. The expression of syndecans in osteoblastic cells was examined by reverse transcriptase-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and immunoblotting in two types of osteoblastic cells, primary cultures of cells derived from the trabecular bone surface (hOB cells) and clonal immortalized hOB cells (AHTO-7 cells). Except for the proliferation rate, these two cell types display similar characteristics of the mature osteoblast phenotype (33.Marie P.J. Lomri A. Sabbagh A. Baslé M. Cell. Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 373-380Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34.Lomri A. Fromigué O. Hott M. Marie P.J. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 64: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As expected in mature mesenchymal cells, hOB (Fig.1 A) and AHTO-7 cells (not shown) expressed low levels of syndecan-1. In contrast, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed high levels of syndecan-2 and -4 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). These results were confirmed by Northern blot hybridization (not shown). Syndecan-2 and -4 synthesis was found to correlate with the mRNA levels as shown by immunocytochemistry in hOB cells (Fig. 1 B) and Western blot analysis in AHTO-7 cells (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that human osteoblastic cells mainly express syndecan-2 and -4.Figure 2Syndecan-2 binds biotin-GM-CSF. A, 200 μg of a PG fraction obtained from AHTO-7 cells were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a hydrophobic membrane. Intact (lane 1), heparinase III-digested (lane 2), or chondroitinase ABC-digested (lane 3) strip of the membrane was incubated with rhGM-CSF bound to biotin. B, a strip of the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-syndecan-2 (lane 4) or anti-syndecan-4 (lane 5). After incubation with avidin-peroxidase, staining was revealed using diaminobenzamidine. Different PGs bound rhGM-CSF (arrowheads), and one of these is recognized by anti-syndecan-2 (double arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the interactions between GM-CSF and syndecans in human osteoblastic cells, a PG-enriched fraction was obtained from AHTO-7 cells. Separation of these proteins was based on their high negative charge, which makes them bind strongly to an anion exchange column. We initially checked that the fraction eluted by buffer with 1 m NaCl contained most of the proteins that were metabolically labeled with 35S in AHTO-7 culture. PGs isolated from osteoblastic cells were separated on SDS-PAGE in nonreducing conditions and electrotransferred on a membrane to analyze their capacity to bind biotin-conjugated rhGM-CSF. Different species of PGs (20, 45, and 70 kDa) displayed affinity for biotin-rhGM-CSF (Fig.2 A, lane 1). Binding of GM-CSF was strongly decreased when PGs on the membrane were digested by heparinase III before incubation with the cytokine (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), whereas chondroitinase ABC digestion did not modify PG affinity (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), indicating that GM-CSF-PG interaction mostly depends on heparan sulfate side chains. To identify some of the PGs that bind GM-CSF, part of the membrane with blotted PG was incubated with anti-syndecan antibodies instead of the cytokine (Fig. 2 B, lane 4 and 5). This revealed heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-2 bind rhGM-CSF. To determine if the interaction between syndecan-2 and GM-CSF occurred at the surface of hOB cells, a double immunostaining of these proteins was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-GM-CSF and a mouse monoclonal anti-syndecan-2. Clear co-localization of the PG and the cytokine was found by transmission electron microscopy using secondary antibodies linked to 10-nm and 5-nm beads, respectively (Fig.3 A). In these conditions, the cells were post-fixed only after the immunocytochemical reaction was performed, explaining the low contrast of the cell membrane (Fig. 3). Beads present at the cell surface were counted and were considered as associated when the distance in between was less than 15 nm. About 30% of the beads that lab"

Because it has been shown in platelets and other cells that small GTP-binding proteins regulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, whose products, phosphoinositides, play a key role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, we have investigated the role of these lipid kinases in store-mediated Ca2+ entry. Treatment of platelets with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3- and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ entry stimulated by thapsigargin or the physiological agonist, thrombin. In addition, wortmannin, another inhibitor of these kinases, which is structurally unrelated to LY294002, significantly reduced store-mediated Ca2+ entry. The inhibitory effect of LY294002 was not mediated either by blockage of Ca2+channels or by modification of membrane potential. LY294002 inhibited actin polymerization stimulated by thrombin or thapsigargin. These results indicate that both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase are required for activation of store-mediated Ca2+ entry in human platelets and that the mechanism could involve the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Reast R. Rink T.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have considered both direct and indirect coupling mechanisms (2.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Indirect coupling assumes the existence of a diffusible messenger generated by the intracellular Ca2+ stores; in contrast, direct coupling models propose a physical interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM; Ref. 2.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Recently a new model for SMCE has been proposed in several different cell types. This involves a physical but reversible interaction between the ER and the PM that may require translocation of portions of the ER toward the PM and mechanical support provided by the actin cytoskeleton (3.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4.Yao Y. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Montal M. Tsien R.Y.

In support of this hypothesis, small GTP-binding proteins, which modulate vesicular transport through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the actin cytoskeleton itself, have been suggested to be important for SMCE in different cell types (5.Bird G.S.

Both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4-kinase) and their products are present in all eukaryotic organisms and tissues that have been investigated, including platelets (12.Heraud J.M.

PI3-kinase and PI4-kinase have been shown to be regulated upstream by small GTP-binding proteins in platelets and other cells (14.Fox J.E.B.

In the classically defined phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) turnover mechanism, phosphorylation at the C-4 position by PI4-kinase yields PtdIns-4-P, the immediate precursor of PtdIns-4,5-P2, the substrate of receptor-activated phospholipase C (16.Berridge M. Heslop J. Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphoinositides can be phosphorylated at the C-3 position by PI3-kinase to generate different lipid messengers, such as PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which are not substrates for phospholipase C (17.Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11147-11156Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2 have been shown to regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement through association with several actin-binding proteins (10.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PtdIns-3-P, PtdIns-3,4-P2, and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 can induce actin filament uncapping, thereby facilitating actin polymerization (11.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A.

In addition, the possible involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in phosphoinositide-mediated SMCE was investigated in human platelets. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) was from Texas Fluorescence. Apyrase (grade VII), aspirin, bovine serum albumin, paraformaldehyde, Nonidet P-40, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin, valinomycin, wortmannin (WT), thrombin, PtdIns, lanthanum chloride, and thapsigargin (TG) were from Sigma. LY294002 was from Calbiochem. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10), anti-PI4-kinase β polyclonal antibody, anti-PI3-kinase p85 polyclonal antibody, and recombinant-Protein A-agarose were from Upstate Biotechnology. [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]phosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fura-2-loaded platelets were prepared as described previously (19.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and platelet-rich plasma was incubated at 37 °C with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 45 min. For co-loading with dimethyl BAPTA, 10 μm dimethyl BAPTA/AM was added for the final 30 min of the fura-2 loading period. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in HEPES-buffered saline containing (HBS in mm): 145 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, pH 7.45 and supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 40 μg/ml apyrase. Fluorescence was recorded from aliquots of stirred platelet suspensions at 37 °C using a Cairn Research Spectrophotometer (Cairn Research Ltd., Kent, UK) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the fura-2 340/380 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (20.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx in TG-induced store-depleted platelets was estimated using the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i for 2.5 min after addition of CaCl2. Thrombin-evoked Ca2+ influx was measured as the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]iabove basal for 2.5 min after addition of thrombin in the presence of external Ca2+, corrected by subtraction of the integral over the same period for stimulation in the absence of external Ca2+ (with 100 μm EGTA). Thrombin-induced release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores was estimated as the integral of the rise in [Ca2+]i above basal for 2.5 min after addition of the agonist. PI3-kinase activity was carry out essentially as described by Way and Mooney (21.Way B.A. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26409-26415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PI3-kinase activity was measured in immunoprecipitates with anti-PI3-kinase p85 antibody complexed with Protein A-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml sonicated PtdIns, 50 μmATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 6 n HCl and 160 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Following centrifugation, the lower organic phase was taken for thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck) to be developed in CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). Radioactive spots were visualized by autoradiography. The autoradiographs were densitometrically scanned on a Quantimet 500 densitometer (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). PI4-kinase activity was monitored in anti-PI4-kinase β antibody immunoprecipitates of human platelets as described by Meyers and Cantley (22.Meyers R. Cantley L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 188: 155-161Google Scholar). Human platelets were labeled with [γ-32P]phosphate as described previously (12.Heraud J.M. Racaud-Sultan C. Gironcel D. Albiges-Rizo C. Giacomini T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17817-17823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled platelets were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min with vehicle or LY294002 followed by treatment with TG. Lipids were extracted, separated, and quantified as described above. The cellular content of F-actin was analyzed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin as described previously (11.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the different samples was determined in a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Samples were excited at 496 nm, and emission was at 516 nm. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) as described previously (19.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Densitometric measurements were made using a Quantimet 500 densitometer (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK), and the integrated optical density of the entire lane was estimated. Analysis of statistical significance was performed using Student's unpaired t test. For multiple comparison, one-way analysis of variance combined with the Dunnett tests was used. The activity of PI3- and PI4-kinase β was determined by immunocomplex assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of LY294002 on PI3- and PI4-kinase β activity immunocomplexed from human platelets is shown in Fig.1 A. LY294002 inhibited the activity of PI3- and PI4-kinase β in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 1.5 and 34.4 μm for PI3-kinase and PI4-kinase β activity, respectively. These results are similar to those reported by Gratacap et al. (13.Gratacap M.-P. Payrastre B. Viala C. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24314-24321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and Downing et al. (23.Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets with different concentrations of LY294002 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the 32P labeling of PtdIns phosphate (PtdIns-P) induced by treatment with TG (200 nm). The concentration of LY294002 required for 50% inhibition of [32P]PtdIns labeling was 22.7 μm (Fig. 1 B). In a Ca2+-free medium TG evoked a prolonged elevation of [Ca2+]i in platelets due to release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ (final concentration 300 μm) to the external medium resulted in a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i indicative of SMCE (Fig.2 A). Pretreatment of human platelets for 30 min at 37 °C with different concentrations of LY294002 decreased TG-evoked Ca2+ entry in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, Aand B). Treatment of platelets with low concentrations of LY294002 (10 μm), conditions under which PI3-kinase activity is inhibited in vitro (Fig. 1), slightly reduced TG-evoked SMCE by 31 ± 4% (Fig. 2 B; p< 0.05). However, pretreatment of platelets with higher concentrations of LY294002 (100 μm), conditions under which PI4-kinase activity is almost completely inhibited in vitro (Fig. 1), significantly reduced TG-induced SMCE to 17 ± 4% of control (Fig. 2 B; p < 0.001). Consistent with the above, treatment of human platelets for 10 min with 10 nm WT, conditions under which PI3-kinase activity has been shown to be inhibited in several cell types (24.Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25.Sorensen S.D. Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. Mol.

In addition, treatment of platelets for 10 min with 1 μm WT, a concentration reported to inhibit PI4-kinase activity (22.Meyers R. Cantley L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 188: 155-161Google Scholar, 24.Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25.Sorensen S.D. Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Heacock A.M. Fisher S.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 827-836PubMed Google Scholar), significantly reduced TG-evoked SMCE by 81 ± 2% (Fig. 2 C;p < 0.001). LY294002-treated cells retained their ability to respond to Ca2+-mobilizing agents such as TG (Fig. 2 A). A similar effect was observed with WT (not shown). These findings indicate that treatment of platelets with these agents did not affect their ability to store Ca2+ in intracellular compartments. Thrombin is a physiological agonist that stimulates a large number of processes in platelets such as calcium mobilization and activation of PI3- and PI4-kinases (19.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26.Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Treatment of human platelets for 30 min at 37 °C with LY294002 at concentrations of 10 or 100 μm reduced the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in a medium containing 1 mm Ca2+ (Fig.3, A and C). The initial peak [Ca2+]i elevation above basal after agonist stimulation was significantly reduced from 349 ± 23 to 271 ± 8 or 166 ± 9 nm after treatment with 10 or 100 μm LY294002, respectively (p < 0.05). If we consider the entry of Ca2+ stimulated by thrombin (see “Experimental Procedures”), LY294002 significantly reduced thrombin-evoked Ca2+ entry by 30 ± 5 and 75 ± 2% at concentrations 10 and 100 μm, respectively (p < 0.01). In the absence of external Ca2+ (100 μm EGTA added) 10 μm LY294002 was without effect on thrombin-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. The initial peak elevation in [Ca2+]i above basal after agonist stimulation was 129 ± 8 nm in control cells and 136 ± 6 nm in LY294002-treated cells (Fig.3 B). However, interestingly treatment of platelets with 100 μm LY294002 reduced thrombin-induced release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores by 26 ± 5% (Fig.3 D; p < 0.01) indicating that 100 μm but not 10 μm concentration of the inhibitor affects PI4-kinase activity, which is responsible for regulating the synthesis of agonist-sensitive pools of phosphoinositides, thus limiting the amount of PtdIns-4,5-P2 available to phospholipase C for the generation of the Ca2+ releasing messenger, Ins(1,4,5)P3. Although our results suggest that both kinases may be implicated in the activation of SMCE, the small effect observed after treatment of platelets with LY294002 or WT at concentrations that specifically inhibit PI3-kinase suggests that PI4-kinase rather than PI3-kinase is in the main responsible for the activation of SMCE or PI4-kinase activity may impair the inhibition of PI3-kinase by phosphorylating PtdIns-3-P molecules remaining in the cell. To our knowledge this is the first time that PI3- and PI4-kinases have been shown to be involved in SMCE. We have previously reported a general inhibitory effect of WT on tyrosine phosphorylation in human platelets (27.Jenner S. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which has been extensively reported to be required for SMCE (e.g. Ref. 19.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Hence we have now examined the effect of LY294002 on store depletion-evoked tyrosine phosphorylation in these cells. Platelets heavily loaded with the Ca2+ chelator dimethyl-BAPTA were used for this study so as to eliminate Ca2+- but not store depletion- dependent tyrosine phosphorylation (28.Sargeant P. Farndale R.W. Sage S.O. Exp. Physiol. 1994; 79: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Dimethyl BAPTA-loaded platelets were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of LY294002 or the vehicle, and Ca2+ stores were depleted using TG (250 nm) and ionomycin (50 nm). In each experiment we checked that the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by TG and ionomycin was abolished by BAPTA loading (data not shown). Samples for protein phosphorylation analysis were taken from the spectrophotometer cuvette 10 s prior, and 45, 170, and 300 s after the addition of TG and ionomycin. As shown in TableI, LY294002 did not significantly modify phosphotyrosine levels at the highest concentration used in this study. The data presented here demonstrated that, in contrast to the effect reported for WT, preincubation for 30 min with the highest concentration of LY294002 used in this study did not have a general inhibitory effect on tyrosine kinase activity stimulated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores.Table IEffects of LY294002 on the phosphotyrosine content of store-depleted BAPTA-loaded plateletsTimeControl100 μm LY294002s−101.00 ± 0.000.95 ± 0.03451.09 ± 0.091.13 ± 0.151701.41 ± 0.091.43 ± 0.113001.70 ± 0.141.70 ± 0.10Dimethyl-BAPTA-loaded platelets were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with either 100 μm LY294002 or Me2SO4 (control) and then were treated with 250 nm TG and 50 nm ionomycin to deplete the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Samples were taken from the platelet suspension at 10 s before and 45, 170, and 300 s after the addition of TG and ionomycin. Platelet proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Western blot with a specific anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the presence of phosphotyrosine residues was quantified by densitometry in Western blots as described.

The data represent the integrated optical density for entire lanes under each condition. Results are expressed as -fold increase (mean ± S.E.) over the integrated optical density of platelet proteins before Ca2+ store depletion. To assess whether the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on SMCE could be mediated by Ca2+ chelation or Ca2+ channel blockage we examined the effect of LY294002 after initiation of SMCE. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of 100 μm LY294002 2 min after the addition of Ca2+to store-depleted cells did not modify TG-evoked Ca2+ entry for up to 30 min, the preincubation time used in this study. In contrast, addition of 100 μm lanthanum, a nonspecific cation channel blocker, caused a rapid decrease in [Ca2+]i over the same time course, indicating that Ca2+ entry had been inhibited (Fig. 4). The lack of effect of LY294002 after SMCE has been stimulated using TG indicate that the inhibition of Ca2+ entry by LY294002 is not due to nonspecific effects as a chelator of Ca2+ or as a Ca2+ entry channel blocker. In addition, our results indicate that PI3- and PI4-kinase activity is required for the activation of SMCE but not for its maintenance in human platelets. Since depolarization of the membrane potential has been shown to reduce the driving force for Ca2+ entry we also investigated whether the inhibitory effects of LY294002 could be attributed to changes in membrane potential by studying the effect of this inhibitor on SMCE in the presence of the valinomycin, which stabilizes the platelet membrane potential close to the K+equilibrium potential (29.Mahaut-Smith M.P. Rink T.J. Collins S.C. Sage S.O. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 428: 723-735Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Treatment of platelets with 100 μm LY294002 inhibited TG-induced SMCE to the same extent in the presence or absence of valinomycin (3 μm) (not shown). Ca2+ influx was 57278 ± 9742 nm·s under control conditions and 7043 ± 1250 nm·s in LY294002-treated cells in the absence of valinomycin (87% inhibition) and 70372 ± 8058 nm·s in control and 11488 ± 2093 nm·s in LY294002-treated cells in the presence of valinomycin (84% inhibition), respectively (n = 3). These findings indicate that the effects of LY294002 are not due to a reduction in the membrane potential. These results together with others presented in this paper indicate that the effect of LY294002 on SMCE is more likely to be explained by inhibition of PI3- and PI4-kinases. These findings are in agreement with previous studies reporting the high specificity of LY294002 as an inhibitor of PI3- and PI4-kinase activity (22.Meyers R. Cantley L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 188: 155-161Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton has been shown to play a key role in the activation and maintenance of SMCE in platelets (8.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (in press)Google Scholar) and other cells (3.Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 7.Holda J.R. Blatter L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and phosphoinositides are required for actin polymerization (10.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4825-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hence we have now investigated the effect of different concentrations of LY294002 on actin filament formation in platelets to assess whether the involvement of phosphoinositides on SMCE activation could be in the reorganization of the actin filament network. Platelets were incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of LY294002 at concentrations 10 or 100 μm. Cells were then treated either with 200 nm TG before addition of Ca2+ (300 μm) or with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) in a medium containing 1 mm Ca2+, and F-actin content was determined. Treatment of human platelets with LY294002 significantly reduced thrombin or TG-evoked increase in F-actin content by 52 ± 5 and 56 ± 5%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 μmand by 81 ± 2 and 79 ± 5%, respectively, when 100 μm LY294002 was used (Fig.5; p < 0.001). Therefore, LY294002 reduced actin polymerization induced by TG or thrombin at concentrations that inhibit both PI3- and PI4-kinases. Our observations are in agreement with our previous studies reporting that actin polymerization is required for the activation and maintenance of SMCE in human platelets (8.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 9.Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346 (in press)Google Scholar). Treatment of platelets with LY294002 had no effect on basal levels of F-actin (data not shown) indicating that either treadmilling is very slow in human platelets or phosphoinositides are not important for the maintenance of the actin network in resting platelets. Recent studies have demonstrated in several cell types that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 plays a role in regulating Ca2+entry (30.Cullen P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A common structural feature between PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a product of PI3- and PI4-kinases, and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is that chemically PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as its inositol head group, with the distinction that the 1-phosphate is esterified. This could lead us to predict that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is an effector molecule in the activation of SMCE by PI3- and PI4-kinases by binding to the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 receptor. However, esterification of the 1-phosphate results in a decrease in binding affinity to a putative Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 receptor, while increasing the binding affinity to a putative PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 receptor (31.Irvine R.F. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although PI3- and PI4-kinase mediation of SMCE is more likely explained by the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, it is important to note that PI4-kinase plays a key role in the formation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and subsequently Ins(3,4,5)P3, which is the immediate precursor of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate that the synthesis of phosphoinositides is required for the activation of SMCE in human platelets. The activity of PI3-kinase and PI4-kinase may represent one of the factors involved in the regulation of the phosphoinositide pool required for the activation of SMCE in these cells, probably through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These data are thus compatible with a physical coupling model for SMCE, which requires actin polymerization for both translocation of the ER toward the PM for initiation of Ca2+ entry and cytoskeletal support for its maintenance (8.Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar)."

Apoproteins (Lhcb) of these complexes, encoded in the nuclear genome, are imported into chloroplasts after synthesis on ribosomes in the cytosol. Studies with the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed that completion of import of Lhcb by chloroplasts in vivo requires interaction with Chl (1.Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In vitro reconstitution of the complex with purified components Lhcb, Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophylls, such as lutein, violaxanthin, and/or neoxanthin, has been remarkably successful in identifying binding sites for Chl within the protein (2.Pagano A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14088-14093Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies have also shown that binding of Chl induces folding of Lhcb (4.Paulsen H. Finkenzeller B. Kühlein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, with the complete protein, the initial event in assembly of LHCII is shrouded by the myriad interactions that occur during reconstitution. To reduce analysis of the interaction of Chl with the protein to its simplest, most fundamental level, we adopted a minimalist approach with short (16-mer), synthetic peptides, designated maquettes (5.Robertson D.E. Farld R.S. Moser C.C. Urbauer J.L. Mulholland S.E. Pidikiti R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. DeGrado W.F. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 6.Mulholland S.E.

We focused on the amino acid sequence in the first membrane-spanning domain (helix-1) of Lhcb, which contains specific residues identified by mutagenesis as critical for import into the chloroplast (7.Kohorn B.D.

A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In particular, the motif EXXHXR, or less commonly EXXNXR, is conserved in helix-1 of all apoproteins that bind Chl a and Chl b, whether specific for photosystem I (Lhca) or photosystem II (Lhcb) (11.Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The third membrane-spanning domain of these proteins also contains this motif, with EXXNXR as the predominant sequence. Evidence of remarkable conservation of the motif throughout evolution is the occurrence of these motifs in apoproteins of light-harvesting complexes containing Chl a and Chl c in chromophytic algae and dinoflagellates (12.Green B.R. Pichersky E. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and in small Lhcb-like homologs in cyanobacteria (13.Funk C. Lindström V. Vermaas W. Argroudi-Akoyunoglou J.H. Senger H. The Chloroplast: From Molecular Biology to Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 103-106Google Scholar). The critical amino acids correspond to residues Glu65, His68, and Arg70 in the sequence of pea Lhcb1 (14.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). (Other amino acids in this sequence are conserved to a lesser extent and indicated as “X” to highlight the functional residues). His or Asn residues in proteins are common ligands of the magnesium atom in Chl, and Glu in an ion pair with Arg also functions as a ligand in LHCII (14.Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The sequence was designated a “retention” motif in recognition of its proposed role in retaining the protein within the chloroplast during import (1.Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe binding of Chl to the motif, an interaction that is expected to initiate LHCII assembly and thereby determine whether the apoprotein is retained in the chloroplast. Peptides were synthesized in the Protein Chemistry Facility at Arizona State University on a Milligen model 9050 Plus continuous flow peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)-protected amino acids. Each product was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and checked for purity and correct molecular weight by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Chl was extracted with acetone from light-grown C. reinhardtii cw15 cells, and Chl awas purified by HPLC on a semipreparative ODS-C18reverse-phase column eluted at room temperature with 100% methanol as described previously (15.Maloney M.A. Hoober J.K. Marks D.B. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 1100-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and Chl was dissolved in a small volume of ethanol. Concentration of Chl was determined with published extinction coefficients (16.Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar). The assay routinely included 200 nm Chl a and various concentrations of peptide in 50 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, containing 30 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OG) or 1 mm n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM). The mixture was incubated at 36 °C in the dark until a steady-state level of fluorescence was achieved, which was usually 15 min. Fully corrected excitation spectra were obtained from 250 nm to 500 nm by measuring emission at 675 nm with a FluoroMax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). A 600-nm cut-off filter was placed in front of the emission spectrometer to eliminate secondary excitation peaks. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature with a Jasco-710 spectropolarimeter utilizing J-700 software, with a cell path length of 0.1 cm, in the continuous mode by taking points every 0.1 nm. Scan rate was 50 nm/min with 1-nm bandwidth and integration time of 1 s. Model building, energy minimization, and molecular dynamics were conducted using INSIGHT II version 97.2 BUILDER, BIOPOLYMER, and DISCOVER modules (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The consistent valence force field was used in all simulations and dynamics calculations were performed at 300 K. Structural simulations were initiated with the peptide in the fully extended form. Maquettes were synthesized with the simplified structures shown in Fig. 1 to reduce the influence of amino acid residues adjacent to the motif (-EIVHSR-). Molecular modeling predicted formation of an intramolecular loop, by electrostatic pairing of Glu and Arg, from which the side chain of His protruded. Consequently, the peptide should contain two ligands that interact with Chl (Fig. 2). The Trp adjacent to the motif in the primary sequence of Lhcb1 (Fig. 1) was included to provide an assay for the interaction. Orientation of the transition dipole of the Trp side chain should favor fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to any Chl molecules bound to the peptide. The fluorescence emission maximum of Trp overlaps maxima at 338 and 378 nm in the absorption spectrum of Chl a, as required for FRET (17.Gadella Jr., T.W.J. van der Krogt G.N.M. Bisseling T. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 287-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, absorbance of Trp allowed quantitation of the peptide. Our strategy was to mix Chl with maquettes in a buffer containing a detergent at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) to achieve a nonpolar environment analogous to a membrane.Figure 2A model of the proposed complex formed between the maquette and Chl. The model shows the initial secondary structure that formed during molecular dynamics of the extended peptide. The N terminus is toward the top of the figure. The Chl molecules were positioned near the ligands in the loop formed by the Glu/Arg ion pair, shown to the left, and His to theright, of the peptide. Side chain atoms of Glu, Arg, and His residues are highlighted in color: oxygen, red; nitrogen,blue; and carbon, green. The adjacent Trp side chain is shown in yellow. Chl molecules are shown ingreen, with magnesium in magenta.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) OG (CMC, 25 mm) was not sufficiently nonpolar to prevent aggregation of Chl, and thus fluorescence was strongly quenched (Fig.3 A). After addition of the maquette to this mixture, an excitation spectrum emerged that was typical of Chl a between 300 and 450 nm, but which also included a strong maximum at 280 nm, the absorption maximum of Trp. However, a control peptide in which His and Glu were replaced with Ala (see Fig. 1) was also able to produce an excitation spectrum similar to that shown in Fig. 3 A, which indicated that in this system the peptides bound Chl nonspecifically. It is notable that the ratio of emission from excitation at 280 nm relative to that at 434 nm, the Soret maximum of Chl a, remained constant as the concentration of peptide increased, which suggested that each peptide extracted a defined number of Chl molecules from the aggregate. The fluorescence yield of Chl in 1 mm DM (CMC, 0.17 mm) was several orders of magnitude greater than that in OG, which indicated that Chl was dispersed into the larger, more nonpolar micelles of DM. An excitation maximum at 280 nm was not detected when the maquette was added to this mixture, and the fluorescence emission maximum of Trp in the peptide remained near 356 nm, indicating that it was excluded from the nonpolar environment. With the possibility that the peptide assumed a secondary structure that prevented penetration of the micelle, the peptide was dissolved in 6m urea and subsequently diluted into the assay mixture. As shown in Fig. 3 B, excitation spectra for this mixture included a maximum at 280 nm that was not present in the spectrum of Chl alone. The maximum at 280 nm was not detected when the control peptide, in which both ligands were eliminated by replacing Glu and His with Ala, was added in urea. Thus, binding of Chl to the maquette in this mixture was sequence-dependent. Higher concentrations of urea in the assay mixture diminished the maximum in the excitation spectra at 280 nm, which suggested that urea served as a competing ligand and prevented Chl-peptide interaction. Thus we took another approach to study this process. Peptides with inverted sequence often have different physical properties (18.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). To test whether an inverted maquette would bind Chl, the 16-mer peptide was synthesized in reverse order to provide the motif as -RSHIVE- in the N- to C-terminal direction. Molecular modeling predicted a loop structure in the inverted maquette similar to that shown in Fig. 2 for the forward sequence. The inverted peptide was more soluble in water yet incorporated readily into the nonpolar environment of DM micelles, as indicated by a blue shift in the emission maximum of W from 356 nm for the peptide in buffer to about 330 nm in the buffer-DM mixture (not shown). Fluorescence of Chl, from a maximum at 280 nm in the excitation spectrum, increased dramatically as the concentration of peptide increased, reaching a level greater than that with direct excitation of Chl at 434 nm (Fig.4 A). The emission spectrum of Chl did not change as peptide was added, except for the increase in intensity (Fig. 4 B). The excitation difference spectrum between no peptide and 5 μm peptide, from 250 to 300 nm, was characteristic of the absorption spectrum of Trp (Fig.4 C). The lack of significant structure in the difference spectrum from 320 to 450 nm indicated that direct excitation of Chl was not altered by addition of peptide. Two additional peptides were tested, one with the inverted motif modified to a single ligand by replacement of His with Ala (-RSAIVE-) and the control peptide in which His and Glu were replaced with Ala (-RSAIVA-) (see Fig. 1). Graphical analysis of the interaction of Chl with these peptides, expressed as a ratio of peptide-enhanced emission by excitation at 280 nm relative to excitation of Chl at 434 nm, yielded typical binding curves (Fig. 4 D). The increase in fluorescence at 675 nm by energy transfer from the single-ligand peptide was approximately half that with the two-ligand peptide at the same concentration. The slopes as well as the y intercepts of double-reciprocal plots of these data (Fig. 4 E) indicated that the peptide with two ligands bound approximately two times more Chl than that with a single ligand. The lack of energy transfer from Trp to Chl with the peptide that did not contain a ligand (Fig.4 D) confirmed that Chl binding to the maquettes under these conditions was sequence dependent. An experiment with free Trp showed that a concentration 1000-fold greater than that of the peptides was required to detect fortuitous energy transfer between the amino acid and Chl (not shown). Because hydroxyl groups serve as ligands to Chl (19.Renge I. Avarmaa R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1985; 42: 253-260Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we tested whether ethanol, the solvent in which Chl was added to the assay, interfered with binding to the peptide. Increasing the concentration of ethanol to 200 μm, a concentration 5-fold greater than typically in the assay, slightly increased FRET but higher concentrations caused a decrease (not shown). The small effect of such high concentrations of ethanol relative to that of peptide indicated that the alcohol did not significantly affect the binding results. This result also suggests that the hydroxyl group of the serine residue in the retention motif does not have significant ligand activity. These data show that Chl interacts with the motif in either orientation. Concentrations of peptides that enhanced fluorescence were in the range of 5–50-fold greater than that of Chl. Either the affinity of maquettes for Chl was low or the experimental conditions did not favor interaction. In support of the latter possibility, the number of micelles in the assay mixture, estimated assuming 80 detergent molecules per micelle (Anatrace, Inc.), exceeded the number of Chl molecules approximately 50-fold. The number of micelles was nearly equal to that of peptide molecules, although from the characteristics of fluorescence of Trp, incorporation of peptide into micelles was not quantitative. Thus, equilibration into, and interaction between, micelles may have been required to achieve interaction of a peptide with more than one molecule of Chl. Once formed, the complex seemed relatively stable, because no loss of FRET was detected within an hour after a 1000-fold dilution of reactants into the same buffer-detergent mixture. The greater emission of Chl as a result of energy transfer from a peptide (Fig. 4, A andD) suggested that FRET increased fluorescence yield. Fluorescence intensity of Chl at the same concentration in acetone was 10-fold greater than that in the assay mixture (not shown), which indicated that the yield in the latter environment was relatively low. Far-UV CD spectra showed that the secondary structures of the peptides varied substantially. The inverted maquette existed predominantly as a random coil in buffer containing DM (Fig. 4 F, trace a), a conformation that apparently facilitated interaction with Chl. Ion pair formation between the positively and negatively charged Arg and Glu residues spaced i + 5 apart is greater than the helix-stabilizing distance of i + 4 (18.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and is expected to form a loop that prevents helix formation. Also, the Arg-Glu orientation in the inverted sequence should interact less favorably with the helix dipole than the Glu-Arg orientation and thus be a helix-destabilizing factor (18.Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). When Glu in the retention motif was replaced with Ala, thereby eliminating the ion pair, the peptide was largely α-helical (Fig. 4 F, trace b). The spectrum of the forward maquette (Fig. 4 F, trace c) was characteristic of a random coil plus a β-hairpin. Support for the latter assignment was the spectrum of the single-ligand peptide, with His replaced by Ala (Fig. 4 F, trace d), which had a weak signal characteristic of β-sheet structure generated by a β-turn (21.Ramierez-Alvarado M. Blanco F.J. Serrano L. Nature Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22.Muñoz V. Thompson P.A. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1997; 390: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). These spectra support formation of the loop structure as proposed by the model in Fig. 2 for the maquette. These experiments provide direct evidence that such motifs in apoproteins of light-harvesting complexes bind Chl molecules, consistent with the predicted function of these sequences in Lhcb (1.Hoober J.K. Eggink L.L. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 61: 197-215Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The environment within the chloroplast envelope probably influences their secondary structure as Lhcb precursors are transferred through the import apparatus. Removal of the transit sequence from precursors occurs rapidly (20.Park H. Hoober J.K. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 135-142Crossref Google Scholar, 23.White R.A. Wolfe G.R. Komine Y. Hoober J.K. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and when the capacity for Chl synthesis is sufficiently high, interaction with newly synthesized Chl locks the proteins into the surrounding membrane. The fact that mature-sized Lhcb does not accumulate in the chloroplast in vivo when Chl is not available for assembly of LHCII, but instead accumulates in the cytosol or in vacuoles (20.Park H. Hoober J.K. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 135-142Crossref Google Scholar), convincingly demonstrated that interaction with Chl must occur as apoproteins pass into the chloroplast envelope. The reduced level of binding of Chl by peptides containing a single ligand provides an explanation for the low accumulation in chloroplasts of mutant forms of Lhcb1 that lack one of the ligands (7.Kohorn B.D. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8.Kohorn B.D. Tobin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12897-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chl seems to be the limiting factor for LHCII assembly (20.Park H. Hoober J.K. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 135-142Crossref Google Scholar, 23.White R.A. Wolfe G.R. Komine Y. Hoober J.K. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and therefore association of two Chl molecules with the native motif is expected to provide a powerful mechanism that regulates entry of Lhcb into the chloroplast."

High level AZT resistance requires multiple mutations (D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q). In order to characterize the mechanism of PFA resistance-mediated resensitization to AZT, the A114S mutation associated with PFA resistance was introduced into the reverse transcriptase (RT) of both wild type and drug-resistant virus. We previously showed that pyrophosphorolytic removal of chain-terminating AZT is the primary mechanism of the AZT resistance phenotype (Arion, D., Kaushik, N., McCormick, S., Borkow, G., and Parniak, M. A. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15908–15917). Introduction of A114S into the AZT resistance background significantly diminishes both the enhanced pyrophosphorolytic activity and the DNA synthesis processivity associated with the AZT-resistant RT. The A114S mutation also alters the nucleotide-dependent phosphorolysis activity associated with AZT resistance. The presence of the A114S mutation therefore severely impairs the mutant enzyme's ability to excise chain-terminating AZT. The decrease in phosphorolytic activity of RT conferred by the PFA resistance A114S mutation resensitizes AZT-resistant HIV-1 to AZT by allowing the latter to again function as a chain terminator of viral DNA synthesis.

Unfortunately, the long term utility of AZT therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals is limited by the emergence of drug-resistant strains, which exhibit up to 200-fold decreases in sensitivity to AZT compared with wild type (WT) virus. High level viral resistance to AZT correlates with multiple mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), namely D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, and K219Q (1.Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), as well as M41L and L210W in some cases (2.Kellam P. Boucher C.A.B. Larder B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1996; 70: 8010-8018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the genotype for AZT resistance has been well characterized for more than a decade, the phenotypic mechanism of AZT resistance remained unclear. AZT inhibits primarily by acting as a chain terminator of viral DNA synthesis. In the past year, we and others have shown that phosphorolytic excision of chain-terminating AZT is an important feature of the AZT resistance mechanism. We first demonstrated that the mutant RT shows an enhanced rate of pyrophosphorolysis compared with wild-type drug-sensitive enzyme at physiologically relevant concentrations of PPi (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown that nucleotide-dependent phosphorolysis is also enhanced in AZT resistance (7.Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E.

Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). While these two mechanisms use different substrates for the phosphorolytic removal of chain-terminating AZT, the chemistry involved in both mechanisms is identical (6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The net result is the decreased ability of AZT to act as a chain terminator of viral DNA synthesis, resulting in HIV-1 resistance to the drug. It has been known for some time that mutations in RT associated with HIV-1 resistance to foscarnet (phosphonoformic acid; PFA) resensitize AZT-resistant virus to AZT (9.Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J.M.

Since PFA is a pyrophosphate analog, we suspected that mutations conferring PFA resistance might affect the enhanced pyrophosphorolytic activity of AZT-resistant RT. We therefore introduced the PFA resistance A114S mutation into both WT and AZT-resistant mutant RT. In this report, we show that the A114S mutation, introduced into a background of AZT resistance, eliminates the increased phosphorolytic removal of chain-terminating AZT. Both pyrophosphorolysis and nucleotide-dependent phosphorolysis are inhibited by the A114S mutation. The A114S-mediated diminution of RT-catalyzed phosphorolysis allows AZT to again act as a chain terminator of viral DNA synthesis, thereby restoring antiviral activity of the drug against AZT-resistant HIV-1. AZT triphosphate (AZTTP) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Phosphonoformic acid and inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Sigma. [3H]dNTPs, [γ-32P]ATP, and the homopolymeric template-primer (T/P) poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12–18 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Heteropolymeric T/P for the measurement of RT RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity was prepared as described previously (15.Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of the highest quality available and were used without further purification. The cloning of AZT-resistant RT has been described previously (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The A114S mutation was introduced into WT and AZT-resistant RT using the SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The presence of the expected mutations was verified by sequencing of positive clones using the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant heterodimeric p66/p51 WT and mutant RT were expressed and purified as described previously (16.Fletcher R.S. Holleschak G. Nagy E. Arion D. Borkow G. Gu Z. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All enzyme preparations were more than 95% pure as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). HIV-1 RT RDDP activity was determined in a fixed time assay. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8, 37 °C), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 nm poly(rA)-oligo(dT)12–18, and varying concentrations of [3H]TTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10–20 ng of RT. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and then quenched with 250 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 20 mm NaPPi. Quenched samples were left on ice for 20 min and then filtered on Whatman 934-AH glass fiber filters and washed sequentially with 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 20 mm NaPPi and ethanol. The extent of radionucleotide incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Assay conditions were identical to those previously described (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, WT and mutant RT were preincubated with32P-labeled heteropolymeric T/P at 37 °C for 10 min. DNA synthesis was started by the addition of the appropriate combination of dNTP substrates (for continuous polymerization experiments), or dNTPs plus the polymerization trap heparin (0.2 mg/ml) for analysis of the processivity of RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis. After appropriate incubations at 37 °C, reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of sequencing gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and a 1 mg/ml concentration each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). The samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C and then analyzed by denaturing PAGE using 16% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The electrophoretically resolved products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Pyrophosphorolysis was assessed as described previously (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Briefly, RT (25 nm p66/p51 heterodimer) was preincubated with heteropolymeric RDDP T/P possessing 3′-32P-labeled primer in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8, 37 °C) containing 60 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min to allow the formation of the RT·T/P binary complex (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Pyrophosphorolysis was initiated by the addition of 150 μm NaPPi. Aliquots were removed at various time intervals and added to equivalent volumes of sequencing gel loading buffer (see above) in order to stop the reaction. The samples were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min prior to denaturing PAGE resolution of products using 16% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea. The resolved products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. A 24-nt DNA oligonucleotide termed RQ-1 (5′-CTG TTC GGG CGC CAC TGC TAG AGA-3′) was labeled with [32P]ATP at the 5′-end and then annealed to a 72-nt DNA template oligonucleotide corresponding to the HIV-1 genomic sequence comprising the 18-nt primer binding site plus the next 54 downstream nucleotides. AZT was then added to the 3′-end of the RQ-1 primer by incubation at 37 °C for 16 h with WT RT and AZTTP (10:1 ratio, to ensure completion of the reaction, as determined in control reactions). 32P-Labeled, AZT-terminated RQ-1 primer was purified by extraction of the appropriate band after denaturing gel electrophoretic separation. The labeled AZT-terminated RQ-1 primer was then annealed to the 72-nt template for use in rescue experiments. RT-catalyzed phosphorolytic rescue DNA synthesis using AZT-terminated T/P was assessed by incubating 20 nm of RT with 40 nm chain-terminated T/P in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of either 150 μm pyrophosphate or 3 mm ATP (pretreated with inorganic pyrophosphatase to remove any contaminating PPi), 100 μm TTP, and 100 μm ddCTP. Under these conditions, the extended primer rescue DNA polymerization product was 4 nt longer than the starting AZT-terminated primer (excision of AZTTP; the addition of four TMP residues followed by termination with ddCMP). Aliquots were removed after various time intervals, quenched by the addition of an equal volume of sequencing gel loading buffer, and then analyzed by denaturing PAGE on 16% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gels. Products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. All of the recombinant RT preparations used in these experiments (WT, A114S, D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q, and A114S plus D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q) had similar enzyme RDDP specific activities (data not shown). In addition, none of these showed any significant differences in affinity for dNTP substrates under normal RT RDDP assay conditions in the absence of PPi (Table I). As previously noted (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res.

Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) and in RT in vitro assays, when introduced into either WT or AZT-resistant mutant RT (Table I). Interestingly, the presence of the A114S mutation resulted in a 20-fold reduction in RT sensitivity to AZTTP inhibition in vitrowhether in WT RT or in a background of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q AZT resistance mutations (Table I). The AZT resistance mutations T215F/K219Q provide increased DNA synthesis processivity to RT and are directly related to a decrease in T/P dissociation from the enzyme (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As previously found, the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT (Fig.1, lane 3) shows significantly greater DNA synthesis processivity compared with WT RT (Fig. 1, lane 1). Introduction of the A114S mutation into the WT background had no effect on the RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis processivity (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1and 2). In contrast, introduction of the A114S mutation into the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT completely abolished the increased DNA polymerization processivity associated with the AZT-resistant RT (Fig. 1, lane 4). The D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT shows a significant increase in the rate of pyrophosphorolysis compared with WT RT (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This phenotype is critical to the mutant enzyme's ability to remove chain-terminating AZT from the primer 3′ terminus, thereby allowing reinitiation of viral DNA synthesis (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2,A and B, introduction of the A114S mutation into the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT significantly diminishes the pyrophosphorolytic activity of the AZT-resistant mutant enzyme. Removal of AZT-MP from a chain-terminated primer has been identified as a critical event in resistance to AZT (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res.

Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, primer extension reactions were carried out under conditions where the obligatory removal of AZT-MP preceded DNA polymerization. In these experiments, 100 μmof ddCTP was included in the reaction to terminate DNA polymerization after the incorporation of the first four nucleotides, in order to facilitate quantification of rescue DNA polymerization product. As shown in Fig. 3, neither WT nor mutant RT catalyzed the formation of rescue DNA polymerization product in the absence of PPi. However, when physiological concentrations of PPi were present, significant amounts of rescue DNA polymerization product were noted in reactions catalyzed by the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant enzyme (Fig. 3, B andC). Similar results were noted when PPi was replaced with 3 mm ATP (Fig. 3, A andC). Introduction of the A114S mutation into the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q background completely eliminated the ability of RT to carry out rescue DNA synthesis from the AZT-terminated primer in the presence of PPi or of ATP (Fig. 3,A–C). The A114S mutation associated with PFA resistance results in a 20-fold decreased sensitivity to AZTTP in vitro, whether present against a WT background or on a background of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutations in RT associated with high level resistance to AZT (Table I). It might thus be expected that the A114S mutation should actually increase HIV-1 resistance to AZT. In fact, viral clones that contain this mutation are hypersensitive to AZT (9.Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J.M. Powell K.L. Darby G. Nature. 1987; 327: 716-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,10.Larder B.A. Darby G. Richman D.D. Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Moreover, introduction of PFA resistance mutations such as A114S into AZT-resistant virus resensitizes the virus to AZT (9.Larder B.A. Purifoy D.J.M. Powell K.L. Darby G. Nature. 1987; 327: 716-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10.Larder B.A. Darby G. Richman D.D. Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 11.Tachedjian G.

It is now apparent that the primary mechanism of HIV-1 resistance to AZT involves an increased ability of the mutant viral RT to excise chain-terminating AZT from the primer 3′ terminus. The “unblocking” of the AZT-terminated primer is accomplished by phosphorolytic cleavage of the terminal AZT, mediated either by PPi(pyrophosphorolysis) (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6.Arion D. Parniak M.A. Drug Res. Updates. 1999; 2: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or ATP (ribonucleotide-dependent phosphorolysis) (7.Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 8.Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used in our experiments, it appeared that 150 μm PPi was more effective than 3 mm ATP in allowing the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT to carry out rescue DNA synthesis from an AZT-terminated primer (Fig. 3), suggesting a preference for pyrophosphorolysis. Nonetheless, both pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-dependent phosphorolysis are able to restore DNA synthesis, and we cannot predict which mechanism would be preferentially utilized in vivo. What is unequivocal however, is that the presence of the A114S mutation completely eliminates the ability of the AZT-resistant enzyme to carry out rescue DNA synthesis from an AZT-terminated primer. The A114S mutation is equally effective at preventing both pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated phosphorolysis. This is not surprising given that the chemistry of these phosphorolysis reactions is identical. Nucleophilic attack of a polyphosphate oxygen on the phosphodiester bond between the last two nucleotides of the primer results in the excision of the 3′-terminal nucleotide, either as nucleotide triphosphate (due to pyrophosphorolysis) or as a dinucleoside tetraphosphate (from ATP-mediated phosphorolysis). The A114S mutation also eliminates the increased DNA synthesis processivity of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q enzyme, in addition to diminishing the rate of phosphorolysis carried out by the AZT-resistant mutant enzyme. We have previously shown that increased RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis processivity directly correlates with decreased RT·T/P dissociation (5.Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18.Arion D. Borkow G. Gu Z. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19860-19864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, T/P possessing 3′-terminal AZT dissociate more slowly from the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant enzyme than do T/P lacking the chain-terminating AZT (19.Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We suggest that the A114S mutation counteracts the effect of the AZT resistance, thereby restoring WT T/P dissociation rates. The resulting decreased RT resident times of the 3′-AZT chain-terminated T/P would then provide less opportunity for phosphorolytic removal of the 3′-chain-terminating AZT. The net result of the diminished rate of phosphorolysis and the increased rate of AZT-terminated T/P dissociation from RT containing the A114S mutation is a restoration of the chain-terminating activity of AZT, despite the continued presence of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutations in the enzyme. The precise structural basis by which A114S acts to decrease both the phosphorolytic activity and DNA synthesis processivity of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutant RT is unclear. Ala114 is one of four highly conserved amino acids (Asp113, Ala114, Tyr115, and Gln151) that form a “3′-pocket,” which accommodates the 3′-OH of the incoming dNTP (20.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). The A114S mutation may alter the structural dynamics of this pocket such that the binding of AZTTP and incorporation of AZTMP into nascent viral DNA is selectively impaired. This is consistent with the 20-fold decreased sensitivity to AZTTP shown by RT with the A114S mutation (Table I). In contrast, ddTTP inhibition of the A114S RT is only slightly reduced (2-fold), and affinities for dNTP substrates are unaffected. However, it is difficult to understand how a selective decrease in AZTTP binding could contribute to resensitization of AZT-resistant HIV-1 to AZT. Residue Ala114 also interacts with the dNTP β-phosphate in the RT·T/P·dNTP ternary complex (20.Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Some studies have suggested that mutagenesis of RT residues interacting with the dNTP phosphates may directly affect RT pyrophosphorolytic activity (21.Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19729-19735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,22.Harris D. Kaushik N. Pandey P.K. Yadav P.N.S. Pandey V.N. J. Biol.

In addition to the A114S mutation, a number of other resistance mutations appear to resensitize AZT-resistant HIV-1 to AZT. For example, the L74V mutation that appears under 2′,3′-dideoxyinosine (ddI) drug pressure has been reported to restore phenotypic sensitivity to AZT in AZT-resistant virus strains (23.St. Clair M.H. Martin J.L. Tudor-Williams G. Bach M.C. Vavro C.L. King D.M. Kellam P. Kemp S.D. Larder B.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1557-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). PFA appears to select for a variety of resistance mutations in RT in addition to A114S, including substitutions at amino acids 88, 89, 90, 92, and 113. All of these suppress HIV-1 resistance to AZT when introduced into the background of the D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q mutations (13.Tachedjian G. Mellors J. Bazmi H. Birch C. Mills J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7171-7181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that all of these mutations diminish the increased phosphorolytic activity of the AZT-resistant RT and that such diminution may be a general mechanism for the resensitization of AZT-resistant HIV-1 to AZT. In this respect, our recent findings with the M184V mutation, which confers HIV-1 resistance to 2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine (3TC), are of interest. The appearance of the M184V mutation in AZT-resistant HIV restores viral sensitivity to AZT (24.Boucher C.A.B. Cammack N. Schipper P. Schuurman R. Rouse P. Wainberg M.A. Cameron J.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2231-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We have recently found that the M184V mutation dramatically reduces the ability of RT to carry out PPi- or ATP-mediated phosphorolytic removal of chain-terminating AZT. 3Gotte, M., Arion, D., Parniak, M. A., and Wainberg, M. A. (2000) J. Virol. 74, in press. This further underscores the importance of phosphorolysis in the AZT resistance mechanism and may account for the prolonged therapeutic benefit associated with AZT plus 3TC combination therapy."

There are three functional domains in NFAT family proteins: the Rel similarity domain, which is responsible for the DNA binding activity and interaction with AP-1; the NFAT homology region, which regulates the intracellular localization; and the transcriptional activation domain (21.Masuda E.S. Imamura R. Amasaki Y. Arai K. Arai N. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 599-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).

The JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line Cl 41 and its transfectant, Cl 41 NFAT mass1, were cultured in monolayers at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg of gentamicin/ml (26.Huang C.

JB6 Cl 41 cells were cultured in a six-well plate until they reached 85–90% confluence. One μg of cytomegalovirus-neo vector, with or without 12 μg of NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent, was used to transfect each well in the absence of serum. After 10–12 h, the medium was replaced with 5% FBS MEM. Approximately 30–36 h after the beginning of the transfection, the cells were digested with 0.033% trypsin, and cell suspensions were plated into 75-ml culture flasks and cultured for 24–28 days with G418 selection (400 μg/ml). Stable transfectants were identified by measuring basal level of luciferase activity. Stable transfectant Cl 41 NFAT mass1 was established and cultured in G418-free MEM for at least two passages before each experiment. Confluent monolayers of Cl 41 NFAT mass1 were trypsinized, and 8 × 103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS MEM were added into each well of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% gaseous air. Twelve to 24 h later, cells were starved by replacing medium with 0.1% FBS MEM for 12–24 h prior to exposure of UV radiation. The cells were then exposed to UV radiation for the indicated times and dosages. The cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously (28.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 3× NFAT-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were originally established by Rincon and Flavell (4.Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These transgenic mice carry the 3× NFAT-luciferase reporter. The offspring mice were screened by testing both the basal level and A23187-induced level of luciferase activity for the presence of the NFAT luciferase reporter gene. Males and females were housed separately in solid-bottomed polycarbonate cages on ventilated animal racks (∼4–5 mice/cage, individualized by incisions in the ears) in temperature-, humidity-, and yellow light-controlled conditions. Food and water were available ad libitum, and the dorsal skin of the mice was shaved every week during the experiment period. The intracellular free calcium was measured using calcium-sensitive Fluo-3 dye according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Molecular Probes Inc.). JB6 P+ cells cultured on coverslips were loaded 45 min prior to the experiment with the tetracarboxylate Fluo-3 AM ester dye to a final concentration of 4 μm dissolved in Me2SO containing 20% of the nonionic detergent Pluronic® F-127 to increase cellular dye uptake. The coverslips were washed three times with Ca2+-free PBS and then were placed in a quartz cuvette containing Ca2+-free PBS, temperature controlled to 37 °C ± 0.1 °C (Neslab, RTE-111, Neslab Instruments, Portsmouth, NH). The changes in the fluorescence intensity at 530 nm (excitation at 500 nm) as a result of intracellular free calcium changes were recorded with a SPEX Fluoromax instrument (Instruments S.A., Inc., Edina, NJ). For all experiments, a basal level of free intracellular Ca2+ was recorded prior to all treatments for each coverslip. The ionophore A23187 in Me2SO was directly added to the cuvette, and for the UVC stimulation, the coverslip was removed from the cuvette, treated with UVC radiation, and placed back in the same cuvette. The data recording during the UVC stimulation was halted. The coverslip was removed from the cuvette for 2 min (equal to the UVC stimulation) and then placed back in the cuvette for control experiments. Cells were grown on coverslips to 40–60% confluency and were fixed with precooled 100% methanol for 15 min at –20 °C. The cells were incubated with the rabbit anti-NFATc1 (K-18) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h in 37 °C. The coverslips were then washed for three periods of 10 min with PBS and counter-stained for 30 min with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and washed for another three periods of 10 min with PBS. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes Inc.) and examined with a Leica microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). The NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice were identified, grouped, and housed as described above. Two weeks after grouping, both basal level and A23187-induced level of luciferase activity were measured by punch skin biopsy. Two weeks after the last punch biopsy, the mice were exposed to UVB (10 KJ/m2), A23187 (0.5 μm/mouse), or UVB (10 KJ/m2) plus A23187 (0.5 μm/mouse). The mice were punch-biopsied to measure luciferase activity at the times indicated. For investigation of inhibitory effects by nifedipine on NFAT activation, 40 μm nifedipine dissolved in 300 μl of acetone/day was applied to the mice topically for 5 days. The last of the five topical doses of nifedipine was given 3 h prior to exposure to UVB (10 KJ/m2) or A23187 (0.5 μm/mouse). Eighteen hours after treatment, the mice were punch-biopsied to determine the effect of nifedipine on induced NFAT transactivation in the epidermis. The luciferase activity of punch-biopsied epidermis was measured as described previously (4.Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Hanenberger D. Cleary M.P. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26325-26331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The relative NFAT activity was presented relative to basal level of luciferase activity of each mouse. The significance of the difference in the NFAT activity was determined with Student's t test. To study the regulation of NFAT transcription activity in skin cells, we generated a NFAT-luciferase reporter stable transfectant by co-transfecting the NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmid and cytomegalovirus-neo plasmid into the mouse epidermal JB6 cell line, Cl 41. The results observed from the stable transfectant showed that either UVB or UVC radiation could induce marked activation of NFAT in JB6 cells (Fig. 1). The activation of NFAT by UV radiation appears to occur in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The maximum induction of NFAT activity by UV radiation occurred between 18 and 24 h after cells were exposed to UV radiation (Fig. 2 b). Because previous studies reported that EGF and TNF-α receptors, PCho and sphingomyelinase may be involved in UV-induced signal transduction pathways leading to activation of AP-1 or NFκB (30.Sachsenmaier C.

However, no induction of NFAT activity was observed in cells stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (25 units/ml), PCho (5 mm), or C2-ceramide (20 μm) (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that UV radiation is a specific stimulus for NFAT transactivation in mouse epidermal JB6 cells, suggesting that signal transduction pathways leading to transactivation of NFAT in the “UV response” may not involve EGF receptors, TNF-α receptors, phosphocholine, or C2-ceramide.Figure 2Synergistic effect of A23187 on UV-induced NFAT activity JB6 cells. 8 × 103 Cl 41 NFAT mass1 cells suspended in 5% FBS MEM were added to each well of 96-well plates. After being cultured at 37 °C overnight, the cells were starved by replacing the medium with 0.1% FBS MEM for 12 h. The cells were treated with UVB, UVC, A23187, UVB + A23187, or UVC + A23187 at the doses indicated. The cells were harvested after being cultured for 18 h (a) or for the time indicated (b). The NFAT activity was measured by luciferase activity assay. The results are presented as relative NFAT-dependent transcription activity.

Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test the effect of Ca2+ionophore on UV-induced NFAT activation in mouse epidermal cells, we incubated Cl 41 NFAT mass1 cells with either A23187 alone or UV radiation plus A23187. The results showed that A23187 (1 μm) has a high synergistic effect on UV-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 2), whereas administration of A23187 alone results in minimal induction of NFAT activity (Fig. 2 a). These data suggest that calcium mobilization in JB6 cells is not the only pathway leading to NFAT activation in response to UV radiation. To assess the alteration of intracellular free calcium after cells were exposed to UVC radiation, the calcium-sensitive Fluo-3 dye was used. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Treatment of cells with either ionophore A23187 or UVC leads to a rapid increase of intracellular free calcium (Fig. 3). UVC radiation also has a strong synergistic effect on A23187-induced calcium release (Fig. 3 d). These data support the notion that calcium mobilization is involved in UV-induced NFAT transactivation. To determine the role of calcium-dependent pathways in UV-induced NFAT activation, we investigated the effect of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, on UV-induced NFAT activation. Blocking calcium channel activity by pretreatment of JB6 cells with nifedipine resulted in inhibition of UV-induced or UV plus A23187-induced calcium release (Fig. 4) and NFAT activation (Fig. 5). These data suggested that activation of NFAT by UV radiation and the synergistic effect of A23187 on UV-induced activation of NFAT are both through calcium mobilization-dependent pathways.Figure 5Inhibition of UV-induced NFAT activity by pretreatment of cells with nifedipine. 8 × 103JB6 Cl 41 NFAT mass1 cells suspended in 5% FBS MEM were added to each well of 96-well plates. After being cultured at 37 °C overnight, the cells were starved by replacing the medium with 0.1% FBS MEM for 12 h. Then, the cells were first treated with 40 μm nifedipine for 1 h and were then exposed to A23187 (1 μm), UVB (4 KJ/m2), UVB (4 KJ/m2) + A23187 (1 μm), UVC (60 J/m2), or UVC (60 J/m2) + A23187 (1 μm). After being cultured for 18 h, the cells were harvested, and the NFAT activity was measured by luciferase activity assay. The results are presented as relative NFAT-dependent transcription activity. Each bar indicates the mean and S.D. of assays from triplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies demonstrated that in T cells the major NFAT activation pathway appears through calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 6.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). To test the role of calcineurin in UV-induced NFAT-dependent transcription activity in mouse epidermal JB6 cells, CsA, a pharmacological inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, was used. Pretreatment of cells with CsA resulted in a dramatic inhibition of NFAT transactivation induced by either UV radiation or UV + A23187 (Fig. 6). These data revealed that activation of calcineurin is required for UV-induced NFAT activation, suggesting that UV radiation activates the NFAT transcription activity through the pathway that is similar to that in T cells. To investigate whether the activation of NFAT by UV radiation involved the nuclear translocation of NFAT protein, we used the indirect immunofluorescence staining for the analysis of the NFAT protein localization. As shown in Fig. 7, exposure of cells to UVC radiation triggered the translocation of NFAT protein from cytosol to the nucleus. These data suggest that UV radiation induced NFAT transactivation through NFAT protein translocation. To investigate the regulation of NFAT induction activity by UV radiation in mouse skin, we exposed NFAT-luciferase reporter transgenic mice to either A23187 (0.5 μm/mouse), UVB radiation (10 KJ/m2), or A23187 plus UVB radiation. In agreement with findings in JB6 cells, UVB radiation resulted in more than a 10-fold increase of NFAT-dependent transcription in mouse skin (Fig. 8). Administration of both UVB and A23187 resulted in a large synergistic effect on NFAT induction (∼140-fold). Furthermore, application of A23187 alone to skin also caused marked activation of NFAT (Fig. 8), which was further confirmed by time course studies (data not shown). Interestingly, similar levels of augmented UV-induced NFAT activity were observed in mouse skin treated with either A23187 and UV simultaneously or A23187 at 96 h prior to UV radiation (data not shown), whereas skin samples from mice at 96 h after exposure to A23187 did not show any induction of NFAT activity (data not shown). Considering data from the JB6 cell study, our results not only demonstrate that UV radiation is a strong activator for NFAT activation, in vitro andin vivo, but also suggested that there are some differences for NFAT activation between the epidermal cell culture model and the mouse skin in vivo model. To determine whether calcium-dependent pathways are required for UV-induced NFAT activation in vivo, we also investigated the influence of nifedipine on UV-induced NFAT activity in NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice (Fig. 9). Topical application of nifedipine (40 μm/mouse) on mouse skin resulted in dramatic inhibition of A23187- and UVB-induced NFAT-dependent transactivation (Fig. 9) (p< 0.05). These results strongly demonstrate that UV-induced activation of NFAT is mediated by a calcium-dependent pathway. Expression of the antigen-regulated, cyclosporin A-sensitive NFAT is not restricted to lymphoid cells as once thought but is now known to be expressed in other cells and organs such as skin (22.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The function and regulation of NFAT in skin, however, remain unknown. In this report, we investigated the possible involvement of NFAT in the UV response by using JB6 cells and NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice. Exposure of JB6 cells or skin of transgenic mice to UV radiation caused marked increases of NFAT-dependent transcription in a dose-dependent manner, whereas other stimuli, such as EGF, TNF-α, PCho, and ceramide, did not induce NFAT activation. Co-stimulation studies showed that A23187 augments the NFAT-mediated transcription synergistically in response to UV radiation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with nifedipine or cyclosporin A results in impairment of NFAT transactivation induced by either UV radiation or UV plus A23187. These results strongly suggest that UV radiation is a specific inducer for skin NFAT transactivation and that induction of NFAT in skin by UV radiation occurs through a calcium- and CsA-dependent pathway. Collectively, these results suggest that NFAT may be a new transcription factor involved in the UV response. NFAT isoforms are expressed in different tissues, as it has been reported that NFAT1 and NFAT2 mRNAs have been detected in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, placenta, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, and colon, as well as in skin tumors (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 22.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). NFAT expression or NFAT-derived transactivation has also been described in several types of nonlymphoid cells, including mast cells (34.Weiss D.L. Hural J. Tara D. Timmerman L.A. Henkel G. Brown M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), endothetial cells (35.Cockerill G.W. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and liver-derived Chang (CHL) cells (38.Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redono J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that exposure of epidermal cells or mouse skin to UV radiation resulted in marked activation of NFAT-dependent transcription. These results are consistent with previous findings that NFAT mRNA is detectable in skin (22.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In T cells, transactivation of NFAT is regulated tightly in response to elevations of both intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) and diacylglycerol following activation of phospholipase C (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular calcium stimulates the production of calmodulin (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). It is believed that binding of calmodulin to a region near the C terminus of calcineurin displaces the autoinhibiting domain and exposes the calcineurin active site (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic NFAT proteins, leading to NFAT nuclear translocation (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 6.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

NFAT forms a heteromeric transcriptional co-activator complex with AP-1 that co-induces NFAT-dependent transactivation (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar). It is also reported that phosphorylation of NFAT is regulated by several protein kinases, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase2 (5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar, 40.Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F.

With the exception of antigen receptor on lymphocytes, there are only a few reports regarding NFAT activation induced by PDGF and hepatitis B virus x protein in vascular smooth muscle cells and liver-derived CHL cells, respectively (37.Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.-F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 38.Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redono J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Also, little is known about regulation and signaling of NFAT activation in skin. This report showed that UV radiation resulted in marked activation of NFAT-mediated transcription through CsA-sensitive and calcium-dependent pathway in both epidermal culture cells and transgenic mouse skin. The observation that A23187 is a stronger inducer of NFAT in mouse skin but a weaker inducer in cultured cells suggests that additional signaling systems in vivo are responsible for NFAT activation induced by A23187. Differential basal levels of AP-1 activity between in vitroculture cells and in vivo transgenic mouse skin, which may be caused by responsiveness of the mouse to its environment, may be one of the additional signals. UV in solar light elicits a number of biological effects in skin, including pigmentation, erythema, skin cell death, and inflammation (43.Matsui M.S. DeLeo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of particular concern is the role of UV radiation as a major etiologic factor in the development of human cancer (43.Matsui M.S. DeLeo V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to UV radiation leads to a large number of physiological changes in cells, such as activation of transcription factors AP-1, NFκB, and p53 (44.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y.

Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), referred to as the UV response. Generally, this UV response serves to protect the cells (44.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The initial signal triggering the UV response is in large part independent of DNA damage, but rather appears to be mediated by a membrane-associated component of the Ras pathway with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (45.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmed M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar, 46.Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C.

This idea is supported by our findings that atypical protein kinase C is a mediator of UV-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and AP-1 activity (48.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that sphingomyelinase is required for UV-induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation (33.Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, others argue that UV-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases may also have a DNA damage signal component (50.Adler V. Fuchs S.Y. Kim J. Kraft A. King M.P. Pelling J. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1437-1446PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Bender et al. (51.Bender K. Gottlicher M. Whiteside S. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5170-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) reported that UV-induced activation of NFκB occurs through both DNA damage-dependent and -independent pathways. In the case of p53, activating signals clearly involve both DNA damage signals and other nongenotoxic stress pathways (52.Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). It is known that p53 function is regulated at the levels of transcription, translocation, stabilization, association with other proteins, and phosphorylation (44.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Regulation of p53 at transcription level may be due to DNA damage signal, whereas phosphorylation, translocation and association with other proteins are mainly through nongenotoxic signal transduction pathways. p53 phosphorylation has been found to be mediated by several cellular kinases, including CKI, CKII, protein kinase A, cyclin-dependent kinase7, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (44.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that P38 kinase is a key mediator for mouse p53 protein phosphorylation at serine 389 in cell response to UV radiation (44.Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Maxiner A. Sun Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12229-12235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that UV radiation resulted in strong activation of NFAT through a calcium-dependent mechanism in mouse skin. It is known that NFAT is a transcription factor playing an essential role in IL-2 gene expression (4.Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1522-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and that binding sites for NFAT have also been found within the promoter regions of cytokines, including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-8 (38.Lara-Pezzi E. Armesilla A.L. Majano P.L. Redono J.M. Lopez-Cabrera M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7066-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 41.Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that expression of IL-8, TNF-α and other cytokines is associated with initiating and controlling effective immune and inflammatory responses and may be related to cancer development (38.Lara-Pezzi E.

Therefore, we suggest that NFAT is a new important transcription factor involved in UV response and that NFAT may be involved in UV-induced skin cancer promotion. This idea is supported by previous findings that NFAT expression in skin tumor is much higher than in normal skin tissue (22.Northrop J.P. Ho S.N. Chen L. Thomas D.J. Timmerman L.A. Nolan G.P. Admon A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and that CsA and FK506, the two most commonly used inhibitors for NFAT activation, by specific targeting and blocking the activation of Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, have strong antitumor promotion activity (53.Singh R.K. Gutman M. Reich R. Bar-Eli M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3669-3674PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Jiang H. Yamamoto S. Nishikawa K. Kato R. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we also found that CsA has strong inhibitory effects on UV-induced NFAT transactivation. In conclusion, UV radiation is a strong inducer of NFAT activation in mouse epidermal cells and skin. Transactivation of NFAT in mouse skin by UV radiation may play an important part in the UV response, which may be associated with UV radiation-induced inflammatory and tumor promotion through NFAT-mediated expression of inflammation cytokines, such as IL-2 and TNF-α. Furthermore, these results provide a possible mechanism of antitumor promotion activity of CsA and FK506.

https://openalex.org/W2067938166,"Effects of vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitors on catecholamine release from bovine chromaffin cells have been examined at the level of individual exocytotic events. As expected for a depletion of vesicular stores, release evoked by depolarizing agents was decreased following 15-min incubations with reserpine and tetrabenazine, as evidenced by a decrease in exocytotic frequency and amount released per event. In contrast, two reserpine derivatives, methyl reserpate and reserpic acid, were much less effective. Surprisingly, the incubations also decreased the accompanying rise in intracellular Ca2+ evoked by depolarizing agents. Subcellular studies revealed that reserpine and tetrabenazine at concentrations near their K i values not only could increase cytoplasmic catecholamines but also could displace Ca2+ from vesicles. Furthermore, transient exposure to tetrabenazine and reserpine, but not methyl reserpate and reserpic acid, induced exocytotic release of catecholamines. Reserpine induced a rise in intracellular Ca2+, as detected by whole-cell measurements with Fura-2. It could induce exocytosis, albeit at a lower frequency, in Ca2+-free solutions, supporting an internal Ca2+ source. Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial Ca2+ pools did not eliminate the reserpine-activated release. These results indicate that vesicular Ca2+ can play an important role in exocytosis and under some conditions may be involved in initiating this process.

For example, the vesicles of chromaffin cells isolated from the adrenal medulla contain nearly 60% of the total Ca2+ contained within the cell (5.Haigh J.R. Parris R. Phillips J.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Vesicular Ca2+ is incorporated during vesicle biogenesis at the Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum apparatus (6.Orci L. Ravazzola M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, vesicles can take up Ca2+ via a Na+/Ca2+exchanger. Calcium is strongly retained in chromaffin vesicles (8.Fitzpatrick S. Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 155: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) because it is associated with the chromogranins, a group of acidic, soluble proteins. Chromogranins also associate with catecholamines, and this composite association allows maintenance of vesicular stores within the small volume of the vesicle. The high concentration of vesicular Ca2+ is of interest since Ca2+ plays a central role in initiating the fusion between the vesicle and plasma membrane during exocytosis. Vesicular Ca2+ is located at the precise location where exocytosis is occurring. If it can be mobilized, it would clearly play a major role in modulating release. Lowering of vesicular Ca2+ decreases exocytotic rates in both pancreatic cells (1.Scheenen W.J. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Fasolato C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19002-19008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and acetylcholine-containing neurons (2.Fossier P. Diebler M.F. Mothet J.P. Israel M. Tauc L. Baux G. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results suggest that vesicular Ca2+ may frequently play a role in triggering exocytosis. In a prior work, we have shown that vesicular Ca2+ in bovine chromaffin cells can be mobilized by exposure to agents that cause an alkalinization of the vesicle interior (9.Mundorf M.L. Hochstetler S. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Normally, the intravesicular pH is 5.5, a value that promotes the association of the intravesicular contents (7.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1558-1565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkalinization of isolated vesicles with methylamine caused Ca2+ efflux. Similar results were found with amphetamine exposure, a phenethylamine that can alkalize vesicles (10.Sulzer D. Rayport S. Neuron. 1990; 5: 797-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In intact cells, these agents increased both Ca2+ and catecholamine in the cytoplasm. With amphetamine, the amount of Ca2+ displaced from the vesicles was sufficient to trigger exocytosis. In this work, we have taken a different approach to disrupting association vesicular contents. We have examined the effects of inhibitors of the vesicular monoamine transporter on Ca2+mobilization from vesicles and its effects upon release. Reserpine, tetrabenazine, and two reserpine derivatives were employed, all of which are specific inhibitors of catecholamine transport (11.Scherman D. Henry J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12.Parti R. Ozkan E.D. Harnadek G.J. Njus D. J.

Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results indicate that VMAT1inhibitors are capable of mobilizing vesicular Ca2+ in addition to catecholamine, that the effects of this mobilization are reflected in altered characteristics of stimulated secretion, and that inhibitors with high affinity for VMAT can trigger exocytosis in the absence of any other secretagogue. Primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were prepared as described previously (15.Leszczyszyn D.J. Jankowski J.A. Viveros O.H. Diliberto Jr., E.J. Near J.A. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromaffin cells were isolated from several bovine adrenal glands by digestion with collagenase and density gradient centrifugation through Renografin to obtain the epinephrine-enriched fraction. Cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105cells/35-mm diameter plate and maintained in a controlled atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Experiments were performed during days 3 through 7 of culture. Microelectrodes were fabricated by sealing 6-μm diameter carbon fibers (Thornel T-650, Amoco Corp., Greenville, SC) in glass as described previously (16.Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The electrodes were polished at a 45° angle on a diamond dust-embedded micropipette-beveling wheel (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and soaked in isopropyl alcohol before use. Electrodes were calibrated using a flow-injection apparatus. Amperometry employed an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the voltage clamp mode with the whole cell configuration (β = 1). The low pass filter was set to 10 kHz, and the gain was 10 mV/pA for Ca2+-containing buffers and 20 mV/pA for all others. The applied potential was +650 mV with respect to a sodium-saturated calomel electrode. The amperometric signal was digitized (PCM-2, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) and stored on video cassette recorder tape. Amperometric data recorded at cells were played back into a PC with commercially available hardware and software (Cyberamp 320 and Axotape, Axon Instruments). Normally, current records were digitally filtered at 400 Hz before analysis. Individual spikes (S/N = 5) were located by locally written software. However, after 15-min incubations with VMAT inhibitors, spikes were sufficiently smaller so that 10-Hz filtering was required to detect the spikes. This over-filtering does not affect the area of each spike (Q), a measure of the quantal size. Data sets were analyzed by single factor ANOVA for statistical significance. Before the experiments, the cells were washed three times and then maintained in a pH 7.4 buffer on the culture plate. The primary buffer contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 11.2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2·6 H20. Chemical stimulations and incubations of the cells were performed with the desired agents dissolved in this solution for the Ca2+-containing experiments. Ca2+-free experiments were performed in the primary buffer that was made without the addition of CaCl2. In every case, the application of buffers alone via pressure ejecting did not elicit release of catecholamine from the cells nor did it cause changes in [Ca2+]i. The culture plate was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Axiovert 35, Zeiss, Eastern Microscope, Raleigh, NC). A pressure ejection device (Picospritzer, General Value Corp., Fairfield, NJ) connected to a micropipette with a 10-μm diameter tip was used to apply secretagogues onto individual cells. The carbon-fiber microelectrode and micropipette were mounted on micromanipulators (Patch Clamp Driver PCS-250, Burleigh, Instruments Inc., Fishers, NY). The micropipette was positioned 25–35 μm from the cell, and the microelectrode was positioned firmly against the cell surface. In experiments that involved incubation of the cells, cells were first tested by pressure ejection of nicotine (typically 4 times for 4–5 s with 2 min between each ejection) followed by the addition of drug and incubation for 15 min. For experiments involving the transient exposure of cells to drugs, the drug of interest was applied via pressure ejection for 4 to 5 s. Cytoplasmic catecholamine levels were determined by incubating the cells with the indicated drug for 15 min and then permeabilizing it via the pressure ejection of 10 μm digitonin (17.Jankowski J.A. Schroeder T.J. Ciolkowski E.L. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14694-14700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Ca2+-free buffer, pressure ejection of 10 mmcaffeine was used to test the exocytotic viability of the cells (18.Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Stauderman K.A. Murawsky M.M. Bootman M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27076-27083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To chelate intracellular Ca2+, the cells were incubated in a Ca2+-containing buffer containing 50 μmBAPTA-AM for 10 min (procedure from Ref. 19.Powis D.A. Clark C.L. O'Brien K.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 204: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were then rinsed with a Ca2+-free buffer and maintained in that solution while agents were pressure-ejected onto the cells. To investigate thapsigargin-sensitive stores, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 1 μm digitonin in Ca2+-free buffer for 2 to 5 min followed by a 5-min incubation with 100 nmthapsigargin in the Ca2+-free buffer. The cells were then rinsed, and release was tested in Ca2+-free buffer (the procedure was modified from Ref. 20.Poulsen J.C. Caspersen C. Mathiasen D. East J.M. Tunwell R.E. Lai F.A. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Treiman M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate Ca2+stores in mitochondria, cells were permeabilized by incubation with 1 μm digitonin for 4 min to allow entry of 50 μm ruthenium red. After 5 min, the cells were stimulated via pressure ejection (procedure modified from Ref. 3.Troadec J.D. Thirion S. Laugier J.P. Nicaise G. Biol. Cell. 1998; 90: 339-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fura-2 AM was dissolved in a 10 μl of 10% Pluronic® F-127 and 40 μl of dry Me2SO mixture. Chromaffin cells were incubated in a buffer solution containing 1 μm Fura-2 AM and 0.1% bovine albumin for 20 min at 22 °C. The cells were then rinsed with fresh buffer, and the Fura-2 AM was allowed to de-esterify for 20 min followed by two additional washes with buffer. Whole-cell fluorescence measurements were made with a pinhole that allowed light from a 27-μm diameter spot on the plate to be detected by a photomultiplier tube (EMPIX Photometer System, Mississaugua, Canada). Cells were alternately excited at 340 ± 7.5 and 380 ± 7.5 nm, whereas emission at 510 ± 10 nm was measured. Light was collected through a 40× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss Fluar 40×, Thornwood, NY). To reduce photobleaching, excitation light from the Xenon arc lamp passed through a 0.5 neutral density filter (30% transmission) positioned between the arc lamp and the 40× objective. Ratios of F 340/F 380 were determined at 750-ms intervals. Vesicles from epinephrine-containing cells were isolated and purified as described previously (9.Mundorf M.L. Hochstetler S. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21.Gratzl M. Krieger-Brauer H. Ekerdt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The vesicle pellet was resuspended in 70 ml of Ca2+-free isotonic buffer without a chelating agent. The vesicles were incubated with the desired compound for 10 min and centrifuged for 5 min, and pelleted vesicles were resuspended in the Ca2+-free isotonic buffer. Calcium levels were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Instrumental Laboratory S-12 AA/AE Spectrophotometer, λ = 422.7 nm; the gas mixture was approximately 5:1 air to acetylene). LaCl3 was added to obtain a final concentration of 1% (w/v) to minimize interference by anions such as phosphates. Standard additions of Ca2+ were utilized to determine the mol of Ca2+/mg of protein. Nicotine and BAPTA-AM were obtained from RBI (Natick, MA). Fura-2 AM and Pluronic® F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Tetrabenazine was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Methyl reserpate and reserpic acid were prepared as described (22.Dorfman L. Furlenmeier A. Huebner C.F. Lucas R. MacPhillamy H.B. Mueller J.M. Schlittler E. Schwyzer R. St. Andre A.F. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1954; 37: 59-75Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from the Lineberger Cancer Research Center (Chapel Hill, NC). The chromaffin cell culture medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium from Life Technologies, Inc. Collagenase was acquired from Worthington Chemicals (Freehold, NJ). Renografin-60 was from Squibb Diagnostics (New Brunswick, NJ). Dimethyl sulfoxide was purchased from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All solutions were prepared in distilled, deionized water (Mega Pure System MP-3A, Corning Glass). To evaluate the effects of incubation with VMAT inhibitors on subsequent release, nicotine was employed as the secretagogue. Individual cells were stimulated 4 times with 50 μm nicotine (with 2-min intervals between each 5-s stimulation), and catecholamine release was monitored. The drug of interest was then added to the buffer. After 15 min, another round of nicotine stimulations was performed as described above. In the absence of drug, no spikes were observed in the 15-min interval between nicotine stimulation (Fig.1 a), and the second series of nicotine stimulations evoked a similar spike frequency and average quantal size to that obtained before the 15-min interval (Fig.2). In contrast, incubation with 90 nm reserpine evoked spikes during the first 8 to 10 min of incubation, and the frequency of spikes was lower (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the spikes revealed that this incubation significantly lowered the average quantal size as well as the spike frequency evoked by the second nicotine exposure (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effects of VMAT inhibitors on quantal size, spike frequency, and Δ[Ca2+]i. Cells were stimulated with nicotine before and after a 15-min incubation period as described in Fig. 1. During the incubation period, the drug indicated was present in the buffer. Amperometric spikes were characterized with respect to quantal size (Q) and spike frequency in the minute immediately after nicotine application (spikes/minute). The data shown in A are the average quantal size after the 15-min interval normalized by the values obtained initially. In this way, each cell serves as its own control. In B, the data is the average spike frequency normalized in the same way. A minimum of 450 spikes after drug application were used in this analysis. Measurements of internal Ca2+ were made with Fura-2 during exposures to K+ before and after a 15-min interval in which the drug indicated was placed in the buffer are shown in C. All results are the average ratios from at least four cells, and theerror bars represent the S.E. All ratios with added drug are statistically significant from the control as analyzed by ANOVA (p < 0.04, degrees of freedom >10). The mean spike characteristics evoked by 50 μm nicotine were typical of previous reports (20 ms, 1.42 pC (corresponding to 4.4 × 106 molecules), and 80 pA, for t 12, quantal size, and amplitude, respectively, when filtered at 400 Hz).RES, reserpine; TBZ, tetrabenazine;AMPH, amphetamine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar experiments were conducted with a lower dose of reserpine, with tetrabenazine, another VMAT2 inhibitor at two different doses, and with structural analogues of reserpine, methyl reserpate and reserpic acid. The latter two compounds did not evoke spikes or alter subsequent depolarization-induced release at doses up to 500 nm. Even at 1 μm they only had slight effects. However, at both concentrations tested, reserpine and tetrabenazine elicited release during the first few minutes of the incubation period (see below). Additionally, the frequency of nicotine-evoked spikes and mean quantal size (Fig. 2) were significantly reduced following incubation with all VMAT inhibitors. Incubation effects with amphetamine were also examined. As with the VMAT inhibitors, it induced release during the incubation interval, diminished quantal size, and decreased the frequency of subsequent nicotine-evoked release (Fig. 2). The effect of incubation with VMAT inhibitors and amphetamine on [Ca2+]i was examined by monitoring the fluorescence ratio of intracellular Fura-2, alternately excited at two wavelengths (340 and 380 nm). In this case, 60 mmK+ was used as a secretagogue, an agent that causes robust changes in the fluorescence ratio, indicating elevated intracellular Ca2+ (23.Finnegan J.M. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5353-5359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For cells that were not exposed to VMAT inhibitors, the rise in [Ca2+]i evoked by 60 mm K+ was unchanged compared with that seen before the 15-min incubation (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the rise in [Ca2+]i was diminished on the second K+ exposure following incubation with reserpine and tetrabenazine at the doses shown (Fig. 2 C). The decreased frequency of evoked spikes after incubation correlates very well with the decreased [Ca2+]i evoked by a depolarizing stimulus. Identical results were obtained with amphetamine (Fig.2 C). To explore the effects of reserpine, tetrabenazine, reserpic acid, and methyl reserpate on [Ca2+]vesicle, the Ca2+ content of isolated vesicles was examined by atomic absorption spectroscopy after exposure to these inhibitors. Isolated vesicles were maintained in Ca2+-free buffer with or without VMAT inhibitors for a total of 15 min. Ca2+-free buffer was utilized to replicate the extremely low amounts of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of the cell. The vesicular content found, 124.9 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein, is quite similar to those found previously for untreated vesicles: 125 ± 15 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein (24.Serck-Hanssen G. Christiansen E.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 307: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and 112 ± 6.3 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein (25.Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reserpine (9 and 90 nm) as well as tetrabenazine (50 nm and 10 μm) caused a decrease in [Ca2+]vesicle (Fig.3 A). These results indicate that reserpine and tetrabenazine, like amphetamine (9.Mundorf M.L. Hochstetler S. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are capable of causing Ca2+ displacement during extended exposure. Methyl reserpate and reserpic acid, both at 1 μm, did not cause significant changes in the Ca2+ content of isolated vesicles. Cells were incubated with the drug of interest in Ca2+-containing buffer for 15 min. To evaluate the effects of VMAT inhibitors on cytoplasmic catecholamine levels, the cells were then transferred to Ca2+-free buffer and permeabilized with 10 μm digitonin delivered from a pressure ejection pipette for 5 s. In some cases, multiple exposures to digitonin were required to induce membrane permeabilization. Under these conditions, the cytoplasmic contents of the cell can leak out, and the electroactive species can be detected with an adjacent carbon-fiber electrode (26.Cahill P.S. Wightman R.M. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The digitonin-induced efflux of cytoplasmic catecholamine is prolonged over several seconds, quite different from the sharp concentration spikes observed during exocytosis. When untreated cells were permeabilized with digitonin, no cytoplasmic catecholamines were detected (9.Mundorf M.L. Hochstetler S. Wightman R.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, measurable cytoplasmic catecholamines were present in cells incubated with both doses of tetrabenazine and reserpine (Fig. 3 B). For reserpine and tetrabenazine, the detected amount of cytoplasmic catecholamine was concentration-dependent. For reserpine, a 9 nm concentration (n = 5) resulted in (5.52 ± 1.65) × 107 molecules being detected, and a 90 nm concentration (n = 4) released (8.03 ± 0.21) × 107 molecules. For tetrabenazine, a 50 nm concentration (n = 4) resulted in (5.46 ± 1.09) × 106 molecules being detected, and a 10 μm concentration (n = 4) released (2.47 ± 0.43) × 107 molecules. Note the strong correlation between amounts of Ca2+ and catecholamine displaced. Reserpine pressure ejected onto intact cells for 5 s evoked exocytosis with a frequency that was concentration-dependent (Fig.4). Concentrations of tetrabenazine lower than 10 μm did not elicit release (Fig. 4). To determine if the lipophilicity of reserpine was a factor in inducing the release of vesicles from chromaffin cells, two derivatives were employed: 1 μm methyl reserpate and 1 μm reserpic acid. These drugs are less effective than reserpine in inhibiting transport of catecholamines by VMAT. Neither is a substrate for transport by VMAT, and both are relatively impermeant when compared with reserpine (12.Parti R. Ozkan E.D. Harnadek G.J. Njus D. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 949-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27.Chaplin L. Cohen A.H. Huett l.P. Kennedy M. Njus D. Temperley S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10981-10985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reserpine derivatives (1 μm) generated only one or two spikes when pressure-ejected onto the cells. Most cells did not respond to this transient exposure to the reserpine derivatives. The effect of pressure ejection of the VMAT inhibitors on [Ca2+]i was examined by monitoring the fluorescence of intracellular Fura-2 alternately at two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm). Transient exposure to 90 nm reserpine caused a brief increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig.5 A), although the change was lower than that evoked by the pressure ejection of 60 mmK+ in Ca2+-containing medium. Ca2+effects induced by tetrabenazine (Fig. 5 B), methyl reserpate, and reserpic acid were not detectable. Additionally, reserpine-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i were not observed in Ca2+-free medium. To test whether external calcium was required for the release response to transient reserpine exposure, this Ca2+source was eliminated by chelation with 0.5 mm EGTA for 5 min, and either reserpine or caffeine was applied onto the cell via pressure ejection for 5 s. Caffeine evokes release of Ca2+ from internal thapsigargin-sensitive stores, serving as a positive control (Table I). Reserpine also induced exocytosis under these conditions, implying that external Ca2+ facilitates more frequent release, but is not required for reserpine-induced release.

However, in the presence of Mn2+, I1PP2A and I2PP2A stimulated PP1Cactivity by 15–20-fold with myelin basic protein and histone H1 but not phosphorylase. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at 2 and 4 nm I1PP2A and I2PP2A, respectively. Moreover, I1PP2A and I2PP2A reduced the Mn2+requirement by about 30-fold to 10 μm. In contrast, PP1C activity was unaffected by I1PP2A and I2PP2A in the presence of Co3+ (0.1 mm), Mg2+ (2 mm), Ca2+ (0.5 mm), and Zn2+ (0.1 mm).

However, when I1PP2A and I2PP2A or Mn2+ were omitted, PP1C emerged with aV e/V 0 of ∼1.6. The results demonstrate that I1PP2A and I2PP2A associate with and modify the substrate specificity of PP1C in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mn2+.

Type 1 protein phosphatases (PP1)1 were characterized by their inhibition by inhibitor-1 (I1PP1) and inhibitor-2 (I2PP1), two thermostable proteins isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Since then, numerous other PP1-binding proteins have been identified (6.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem.

These proteins show remarkable specificity in binding to the catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1C) and may direct the subcellular localization as well as dictate the substrate specificity of the phosphatase. The type-2 protein phosphatases were all insensitive to I1PP1 and I2PP1 (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

Subsequent studies showed that the type-2 phosphatases were a complex group of enzymes, with many different genes encoding their catalytic and regulatory subunits (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv.

The enzyme is composed of the C or catalytic subunit bound to two regulatory subunits, termed A and B (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

Along with the A-subunit, the B-subunits dictate the substrate specificity and probably the subcellular localization of the PP2A heterotrimeric complex (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv.

Thus, PP1 and PP2A appear to have evolved common regulatory paradigms by which cellular proteins dictate the unique functions of these two major cellular serine/threonine phosphatases.Recently, we identified two potent PP2A inhibitor proteins that were tentatively designated I1PP2A and I2PP2A (9.Li M.

These proteins were shown to inhibit PP2A1 (the ABC complex), PP2A2(the AC dimer), and PP2AC (the C subunit) in a noncompetitive manner and with K i values in the low nanomolar range (9.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z.

Molecular cloning studies (10.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) revealed that I1PP2A was equivalent to PHAP-I (12.Vaesen M.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), I1PP2A and I2PP2A may regulate cellular growth and differentiation. Consistent with these possibilities, expression of I2PP2A in HEK293 cells increased the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of the c-junproto-oncogene as well as the activity of the AP-1 transcription complex (23.Al-Murrani S.W.K. Woodget J. Damuni Z. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because they did not affect the activities of purified preparations of PP1C, protein phosphatase 2B, and protein phosphatase 2C, I1PP2A and I2PP2A were considered PP2A-specific (9.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). However, in these studies, the effects of the inhibitor proteins on PP2A and PP1C activity were determined in the absence of divalent cations, which can stimulate, inhibit, or have no effect on the activities of these phosphatases depending on the substrate employed (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Hemmings B.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 287-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3.Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol.

Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether divalent cations affected the activities of I1PP2A and I2PP2A with PP1 and PP2A.In this paper, we report on the surprising finding that, in the presence of nearly physiological concentrations of Mn2+, I1PP2A and I2PP2A markedly stimulate the activity of PP1C with some substrates, including32P-labeled MBP and histone H1 but not phosphorylase. In contrast, Mn2+ does not affect the inhibition of PP2A by I1PP2A and I2PP2A. The possible physiological significance of these novel effects of I1PP2A and I2PP2A is discussed.DISCUSSIONTo date, studies of the two major cellular serine/threonine phosphatases have established a common pattern by which regulatory subunits that interact with PP1 and PP2A catalytic subunits determine their cellular functions (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Most PP1 or PP2A regulatory subunits show remarkable specificity in their association with the target phosphatase and control cellular functions of these enzymes by dictating substrate recognition and/or subcellular localization. However, recent studies have hinted at the existence of cellular proteins that bind more than one phosphatase and may represent a new paradigm for coordinating phosphatase functions. For example, HOX11, a protein implicated in human T-cell leukemia, was recently shown to bind both PP1 and PP2A (34.Kawabe T. Muslin A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HOX11 reduced the phosphorylase phosphatase activity measured in oocyte extracts and blocked cell division at the G2/M transition (34.Kawabe T. Muslin A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the biological effects of HOX11 were not clearly assigned to the inhibition of PP1 or PP2A. Similarly, α4, a potential target of the immunosuppressant, rapamycin, inhibited PP2A and the structurally related phosphatases, PP4 and PP6 in vitro(35.Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of this finding remains unclear. The present studies introduce yet another potential regulatory paradigm for serine/threonine phosphatases by which two recently identified PP2A inhibitors, I1PP2A and I2PP2A, implicated in human cancers, associated with another major cellular phosphatase, PP1, and enhanced its activity in vitro against selected phosphoprotein substrates in the presence of nearly physiological concentrations of Mn2+. In this regard, it is noteworthy that PP2A and the structurally related enzymes PP4 and PP6 not only share the property of associating with α4 (35.Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but also associate with a recently identified novel PP4 subunit with structural similarity to the A-subunit (36.Kloeker S. Wadzinski B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5339-5347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether PP4 and other related enzymes include domains required for I1PP2A and I2PP2A binding and whether these two proteins regulate PP4 and other PP2A-related phosphatases remains to be investigated.Most of the PP1 regulators identified thus far show a remarkable specificity in their interaction with PP1C. Many of these proteins share a canonical tetrapeptide motif, RVXF, which represents an important PP1-binding domain (37.Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), which may approximate to the RVXF motif. However, no such sequence was found in I1PP2A (10.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which functioned in essentially the same manner as I2PP2A to stimulate the histone H1 and MBP phosphatase activity of PP1C (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). PP1C and PP2ACshare nearly 48% primary sequence identity (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv.

Direct examination of a synthetic poly-Glu peptide, analogous to these acidic C-terminal sequences, failed to stimulate PP1C and instead inhibited MBP dephosphorylation (Fig.3 C). Similarly, a proteolyzed form of I2PP2A purified from bovine kidney and predicted to lack these C-terminal sequences stimulated PP1C activity in a manner essentially indistinguishable from the full-length recombinant protein (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, known PP1 regulators containing the RVXF motif do not display a Mn2+-dependent PP1C binding, and many inhibited phosphorylase phosphatase activity (6.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In contrast, I1PP2A and I2PP2A showed an absolute requirement for Mn2+ for PP1C binding (Fig. 2) and had no discernible effect on dephosphorylation of phosphorylase aby PP1 (not shown).PP1, PP2A, and other members of this family of protein serine/threonine phosphatases contain a bimetallic catalytic center that in the native enzyme most likely contains Fe2+ and Zn2+ (39.Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar,40.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). However, the tissue-purified enzymes are normally active in the absence of added divalent cations but can be readily converted into Mn2+-dependent activities by a variety of treatments including inhibition by ATP, pyrophosphate, and NaF (1.Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mayer-Jaekel R.E.

J. 1988; 256: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This conversion to a Mn2+-dependent state can also occur spontaneously during the purification or storage of these enzymes. For example, Chu et al. (24.Chu Y. Lee E.Y.C. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) recently purified to homogeneity a Mn2+-dependent form of PP1C from cardiac myofibrils. X-ray crystallography of recombinant PP1C indicates that Mn2+ replaces the site 2 metal, Zn2+, which is not incorporated when this enzyme is expressed in bacteria (39.Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 40.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This may in part be caused by the oxidation of Cys127, which coordinates the site 2 metal and thus facilitates the positioning of the phosphate group in the catalytic site (39.Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 40.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Our findings argue against the oxidation state of Cys127 as a mechanism for promoting PP1Cassociation with I1PP2A and I2PP2A. First, both the recombinant PP1Cα and PP1C freshly purified from skeletal muscle exhibit similar Mn2+-dependent association with I1PP2A and I2PP2A (Figs. 1 and 2) Second, I1PP2A and I2PP2A display specificity in that they promote Mn2+-stimulated dephosphorylation of MBP and histone H1 but not phosphorylase (Fig. 2). Finally, the ability of I1PP2A and I2PP2A to associate with PP1 (Fig. 5) and PP2A (9.Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 10.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 11.Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) also discounts this possibility.Based on the location of Mn2+ in the crystal structure of PP1C (39.Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T.W. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 40.Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), one might interpret Mn2+-stimulated protein dephosphorylation by PP1 simply as indicating conformational changes in the metal-binding site that in turn modulate substrate recognition. This is indicated by the observation that Mn2+ stimulates the PP1C- and PP2AC-catalyzed dephosphorylation of some substrates but not all (Table I). Moreover, the presence of PP2A regulatory subunits alters the cation dependence of this enzyme for the dephosphorylation of phosphorylase as noted in earlier reconstitution studies with PP2A subunits (42.Nishito Y. Usui H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Inoue R. Tanabe O. Nagase T. Murakami T. Takeda M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, association of the PP1-specific inhibitor, I2PP1, with recombinant PP1C and the subsequent cycle of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of I2PP1 converted this Mn2+-dependent enzyme into an apparently Mn2+-independent phosphatase with properties similar to those of PP1C isolated from tissues (33.Zhang A.J. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This led to speculation that I2PP1 functioned as a chaperone to refold newly synthesized PP1C rather than as an endogenous inhibitor of PP1C activity (43.MacKintosh C. Garton A.J. McDonnell A. Barford D. Cohen P.T. Tonks N.K. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44.Alessi D.R. Street A.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is worth noting that both I1PP2A and I2PP2A reduced the Mn2+requirement for maximal PP1C activity against MBP and histone H1 by about 30-fold (Fig. 4), perhaps implying that these proteins induced similar conformational changes in the PP1 catalytic site. Whether this defines I1PP2A and I2PP2A as potential PP1Cchaperones is unclear. The association of I1PP2A and I2PP2A and the accompanying conformational changes may maximize cellular PP1C activity with certain substrates at nearly physiological concentrations of the divalent cation.In cells, PP1 activity appears to be stimulated in response to insulin and other mitogens (45.Scrimgeour A.G.

Reddy S.A.G. Damuni Z. Biochem J. 1992; 287: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Our finding that the two cellular proteins, I1PP2A and I2PP2A, modulate the activities of PP1 and PP2A against certain substrates in opposite directions provides a potential mechanism for coordinating the activity of these and perhaps other members of this family of phosphatases. In this regard, it is interesting to note that I1PP2A and I2PP2A have been linked to the development of human cancers (13.Chen T-H. Brody J.R. Romantsev F.E., Yu, J.-G. Kayler A.E. Voneiff E.

In brain, PASK associated with protein complexes that contained actin and tubulin, confirming the association of PASK with the cytoskeletonin vivo. Glutathione S-transferase-PASK fusion protein cosedimented with F-actin, indicating that PASK binds to F-actin. In contrast to rat tissues, PASK was detected only in the Triton X-100-soluble cytosolic fraction in cultured PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells. Cytosolic PASK translocated to the cytoskeleton when these cells were stimulated with severe cellular stresses such as hypertonic sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and heat shock at 45 °C. Our results suggest that PASK may be involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton in response to cellular stresses such as hyperosmotic shock.

Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15984-15992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2.Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Ste20-related protein kinases, which have a catalytic domain highly homologous to that of Ste20, have been identified in various eukaryotes, and their family is expanding. Members of this family can be divided into two groups based on their structure and regulation. The kinases of the first group, including PAKs1 and Ste20, have a catalytic domain at the carboxyl terminus and a regulatory domain at the amino terminus, which contains a binding site for Rac1 and Cdc42 (3.Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). The kinases of the second group have a catalytic domain at the amino terminus and a putative regulatory domain at the carboxyl terminus and are structurally related to yeast Sps1. Some of the Sps1 subfamily members, including germinal center kinase, hematopoietic progenitor kinase, Nck-interacting kinase, and kinase homologous to SPS1/STE20, have been shown to activate the stress-activated protein kinase/JNK pathway in transfection experiments (4–8; for review, see Ref. 9.Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition to their roles as upstream activators of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, members of the Ste20 family have been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization. The small GTPase Rac1 and Cdc42, upstream activators of PAK/Ste20 subfamily members, are considered key regulatory molecules that link surface receptors to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (10.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). ADrosophila homolog of PAK, DPAK, has been reported to colocalize with focal adhesion and focal complexes (11.Harden N. Lee J. Loh H.Y. Ong Y.M. Tan I. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1896-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PAK1 in fibroblast cell lines has been shown to translocate from the cytosol to Rac- and Cdc42-dependent actin structures when cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (12.Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It has been reported that expression of activated mutants of PAK1 in mammalian cells induces actin reorganization (13.Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H. Chen X.Q. Dong J.M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). For Sps1/germinal center kinase subfamily members, there are no reports concerning their roles in the regulation of cytoskeletal proteins except thatDictyostelium Severin kinase has been shown to phosphorylate actin binding protein severin (15.Eichinger L. Bahler M. Dietz M. Eckerskorn C. Schleicher M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12952-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have recently cloned a rat Ste20-related protein kinase of the Sps1/germinal center kinase subfamily and named it PASK (proline- and alanine-richSte20-related kinase; Ref. 16.Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). PASK was present in both the cytosol and particulate fraction in the rat brain. The particulate PASK was not solubilized by extraction with Triton X-100, suggesting that it was associated with complexes of high density such as cytoskeleton. In this report, we identified actin and tubulin as the major constituents of PASK-associated proteins in the brain, confirming the association of PASK with the cytoskeleton in vivo. In addition, we examined changes in the subcellular distribution of PASK in cultured PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells in response to extracellular stimuli. We demonstrated that PASK translocates from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton upon stimulation of the cells with severe cellular stresses. PASK is the first example of Sps1/germinal center kinase subfamily kinase that is shown to associate with the cytoskeleton. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee for Animal Research of Mie University. Tissues from adult Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (13 weeks old) were homogenized with a Polytron in 10 volumes of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm p-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). To the homogenates, we added 1 volume of buffer A containing 4% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) were saved, and the pellets were washed with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 to obtain the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fractions. Antibody against the carboxyl-terminal region of PASK (amino acid residues 424–553) was prepared as described previously (16.Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This antibody recognized a protein of 66 kDa on Western blot in COS-7 cells transfected with a full-length PASK cDNA but not in cells transfected with an empty vector. The antibody also detected a single protein of 66 kDa in many rat tissues, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes PASK. In addition, the antibody immunoprecipitated PASK from the lysate of the transfected cells. Anti-PASK antibody (0.3 mg) was covalently bound to 1 ml ofN-hydroxysuccimide-activated Sepharose (HiTrap affinity column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to prepare an anti-PASK immunoaffinity column. Frozen rat brains (4 g) were homogenized with Polytron in 20 ml of extraction buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm p-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant (210 mg of protein) was applied to the anti-PASK antibody column. After washing the column with phosphate-buffered saline and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Rat brain extract (14 mg of protein) prepared as described above was incubated with 10 μg of anti-PASK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, and the immune complex was precipitated with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the gel with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. After electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Immobilon; Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry electroblot apparatus. PVDF membranes were probed for 1 h with anti-PASK antibody (1 μg/ml). Anti-JNK1 antibody (catalog no. sc-571; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at 0.5 μg/ml to detect JNK1 and JNK2. Bound antibodies were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. Actin and tubulin in the immune complex were detected with anti-actin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and anti-α-tubulin (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada) antibodies, respectively: bound antibodies were visualized by the use of peroxidase-anti-peroxidase complex and diaminobenzidine. Recombinant GST-PASK and -truncated PASK fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (16.Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GST-JNK2 protein was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. pGEX-4T-xynCΔC, which encodes GST-tagged Clostridium thermocellum xylanase XynC (amino acids 33–547), was a generous gift from Dr. T. Kimura and Dr. K. Ohmiya (Mie University; Ref. 17.Hayashi H. Takagi K.I. Fukumura M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-xylanase (33–547) was expressed from this plasmid inEscherichia coli strain BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Actin sedimentation assay was performed according to den Hartigh et al. (18.den Hartigh J.C. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 10 μg of rabbit muscle G-actin (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) for 10 min in 200 μl of buffer containing 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm ATP. Actin polymerization was induced by adding 75 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2, and after 1 h at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 25 °C. Proteins in the supernatant and the pellet were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by silver staining. To determine whether PASK could bind to unpolymerized G-actin, 2 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-PASK fusion protein were incubated with 10 μg of G-actin under the same conditions as for the cosedimentation assay, except that KCl and MgCl2 were omitted. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with gentle agitation, the Sepharose beads were washed three times with the incubation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. PC12 cells were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Life Technologies), 5% fetal calf serum (Cansera International Inc., Rexdale, Ontario, Canada), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). PC12 cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm dishes (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and NIH 3T3 cells grown on normal tissue culture dishes were treated with various stimuli as described. After stimulation, dishes were immediately placed on ice. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 250 μl of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm p-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 120 mmNaCl using a rubber policeman. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants (Triton X-100-soluble fraction) were saved, and the pellets were washed with 0.25 ml of extraction buffer to obtain Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. These fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PASK antibody as described above. The amount of PASK protein in these fractions was determined by densitometric scanning (Sharp JX-330M scanner) of the blot, using NIH Image software (version 1.61). PC12 cells grown on poly-d-lysine-coated 60-mm dishes were washed three times with serum- and phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) and incubated in this medium (1.35 ml) containing 0.75 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 2 h. Then the cells were stimulated for 1 h with hypertonic NaCl by the addition of 0.15 ml of 5 m NaCl. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-free medium and harvested in 250 μl of extraction buffer. Triton X-100-soluble supernatants and -insoluble pellets were prepared as described above. PASK immunoprecipitation was performed according to the method of Moore and Sefton (19.Moore D.D. Sefton B.M. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 17.1-17.14Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were suspended in 50 μl of SDS lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled for 3 min. To the suspensions, 200 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay correction buffer (1.25% Nonidet P-40, 1.25% sodium deoxycholate, 12.5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 62.5 mm NaF, 62.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 12.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1.25 mm Na3VO4) were added, and the supernatants were obtained by centrifugation. These supernatants were incubated for 3 h with non-immune rabbit IgG preadsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads to remove proteins that bind to the resin and IgG nonspecifically and clarified by centrifugation. PASK was immunoprecipitated by incubation with 2.5 μg of anti-PASK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by protein A-Sepharose precipitation. Sepharose beads were washed five times with immunoprecipitate wash buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm p-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Phosphorylation of blotted proteins was quantified by scanning on a Fuji BAS1000 bioimaging analyzer. The same membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PASK antibody. We performed fractionation studies to determine whether PASK associates with the cytoskeleton in rat tissues and cultured PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells. Homogenates of rat brain, adrenal gland, heart, stomach, testis, epididymis, PC12 cells, and NIH 3T3 cells prepared in 2% Triton X-100 were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. The amount of PASK protein in each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PASK (424–553) antibody. Consistent with the results of a previous study (16.Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), ∼50% of PASK in rat brain was recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. As shown in Fig. 1, PASK was detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of other tissues, although the ratios of PASK protein in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction to that in the soluble fraction varied considerably among these tissues and were generally smaller than that of brain. In contrast to these tissues, PASK was not detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of PC12 or NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggested that at least a component of PASK associates with the cytoskeleton in rat tissues but not in PC12 or NIH 3T3 cells. To confirm that PASK associates with the cytoskeleton, proteins associated with PASK in rat brain were analyzed by immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation with anti-PASK antibody. Brain extracts were applied to the anti-PASK immunoaffinity column. After washing and elution of bound proteins, the adsorbed proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2 A, lane 2, shows silver staining of the proteins eluted from the anti-PASK antibody affinity column. A band at 45 kDa and a doublet at 50 kDa were the major proteins copurified with PASK. As shown in Fig. 2 B, left panel, these proteins were identified as actin and tubulin by immunoblotting with anti-actin and anti-α-tubulin antibodies, respectively. Actin and tubulin were also coprecipitated with PASK by anti-PASK antibody and protein A-Sepharose, whereas none of these proteins was precipitated by nonimmune IgG (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These results indicate that PASK forms molecular complexes with actin and tubulin. To assess the actin-binding properties of PASK and to determine which region of PASK binds actin, the behavior of various GST-PASK and truncated PASK fusion proteins (Fig. 3 A) in an actin sedimentation assay was tested. Rabbit muscle actin was incubated with GST-PASK fusion proteins for 1 h in the presence or absence of KCl and MgCl2. Subsequently, the actin filaments were sedimented by centrifugation. Both pellet and supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 B, when actin was polymerized by the addition of KCl and MgCl2, GST-PASK (full-length), GST-PASK (66–553), and GST-PASK (245–424) cosedimented with F-actin and were found almost entirely in the pellet. GST-PASK (1–360) also cosedimented with F-actin, although a portion of it remained in the supernatant. GST-PASK (1–72) and GST-PASK (424–553) did not cosediment with F-actin and were found entirely in the supernatant. When actin was left unpolymerized (Fig. 3 B, −(KCl, MgCl 2 )), all the fusion proteins remained in the supernatant. To determine the specificity of the association between PASK and F-actin, control experiments were performed with GST-JNK2 and GST-xylanase (33–547), which are similar in size to GST-PASK. These proteins did not cosediment with F-actin under the assay conditions (Fig. 3 B). These results indicated that PASK associates with F-actin in vitro and that PASK interaction with F-actin is mediated by the region within amino acid residues 245–424. To determine whether PASK could bind to unpolymerized G-actin, GST-PASK and GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with G-actin. Sepharose beads were then washed with incubation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Sepharose-bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 C, no actin was detected in association with GST-PASK or GST, indicating that PASK did not bind to G-actin under the assay conditions. It is known that certain protein kinases, including PKCs and p160ROCK, interact with cytoskeletal proteins and translocate from the cytosol to cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli (20.Blobe G.C. Stribling D.S. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15823-15830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21.Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J.

J. 1997; 328: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether translocation of PASK from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton was induced upon stimulation of PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells. For this purpose, PASK distribution was analyzed by cell fractionation after treatment of these cells with various stimuli. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, upper two panels, PASK was detected in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction when PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells were osmotically stressed with NaCl or sorbitol, oxidatively stressed with H2O2, or heat-shocked at 45 °C. In these cells, the amount of PASK in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, Cand D). To quantitate the changes in the distribution of PASK, dilution series of the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions were resolved in the same gel and subjected to densitometric analysis. In cells stimulated with +0.5 m NaCl for 1 h and in cells treated at 45 °C for 1 h, ∼30 and 80% of total PASK for PC12 cells and 20 and 80% of it for NIH 3T3 cells, respectively, were found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. There was a concomitant stoichiometric decrease in the amount of soluble PASK. In Fig. 4, the reduction of soluble PASK is less obvious than the increase of insoluble PASK, because 5-fold excess amounts of the insoluble fractions were subjected to the immunoblot analysis. These results indicated that PASK translocated from the cytosol to the cytoskeleton in response to cellular stresses. The translocation was unique to PASK and not attributable to an artifact of cell fractionation, because the distribution of JNK1 and JNK2 in these stimulated cells was considerably different from that of PASK (Fig. 4,A and B, lower two panels): there was no significant increase in JNK2 in the insoluble fraction by any of these stresses; JNK1 did not translocate by hypertonic stress in NIH 3T3 cells, although its amount in the insoluble fraction increased by the other stresses. In contrast to the translocation by these stresses, PASK in PC12 cells did not translocate by hypotonic stress, stimulation of acetylcholine receptor with 1 mm carbachol, inhibition of protein synthesis with 50 μg/ml anisomycin, or exposure of the cells to 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 1 h (Fig. 4 E and data not shown). Relatively mild stresses such as +0.2 m NaCl, 0.5 mm H2O2, and heat shock at 42 °C also failed to induce PASK translocation (Fig. 4 F and data not shown). These results suggested that PASK translocation was specifically induced by severe cellular stresses. As shown in Fig.4 G, hypertonic NaCl-induced PASK translocation was reversible: the amount of PASK in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction returned to a control level when cells were incubated in an isotonic medium for 4 h after hypertonic stress. To investigate the mechanism of hypertonic NaCl-induced PASK translocation, we examined whether such a process involved phosphorylation of PASK. PC12 cells were labeled with [32P]Pi and stimulated with a hypertonic medium (+0.5 m NaCl) for 1 h. The cells were extracted to obtain Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. PASK was immunoprecipitated with anti-PASK antibody directly from the Triton X-100-soluble fraction and after extraction in 0.5% SDS from the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. The same membrane was probed with anti-PASK antibody to determine the amount of PASK protein in each lane. As shown in Fig.5, phosphorylated PASK was immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction of control cells. This indicated that PASK is probably constitutively phosphorylated in PC12 cells. The level of PASK phosphorylation in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the stimulated cells was reduced to ∼20 and 40% of that in the soluble fraction of the control and the stimulated cells, respectively. In cells stimulated with the hypertonic medium, a labeled band that migrated slightly faster than PASK was detected in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. This band was not counted, because it was undetectable by immunoblot with anti-PASK antibody. These results indicate that PASK translocation to the cytoskeleton correlates with PASK dephosphorylation. We examined the effect of two cytoskeletal poisons on hypertonic NaCl-induced PASK translocation. PC12 cells were first treated with 20 μm cytochalasin B or 100 μm colchicine for 1 h to block the polymerization of actin or tubulin, respectively. This was followed by stimulation of cells with the hypertonic medium (+0.5 m NaCl) for 1 h. As shown in Fig.6, these inhibitors had no effect on PASK distribution in both the control cells and NaCl-stimulated cells. These results suggest that rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is not involved in PASK translocation. Hydropathy plots of the primary structure of PASK suggest that it is a soluble protein present in the cytosol. However, cell fractionation studies showed that PASK existed not only in the cytosol but also as protein complexes of high density such as the cytoskeleton. Immunoaffinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation using anti-PASK antibody revealed that actin and tubulin were the major constituents of PASK-associated protein complexes. These results indicate that PASK actually associates with the cytoskeleton. In cosedimentation experiments, PASK was shown to bind F-actin in vitro. However, it is not clear whether PASK binds directly to actin, because it is possible that the actin preparation used in our experiments was contaminated by an adapter protein that binds PASK to actin. In addition, PASK has no known actin binding motifs. Ste20 has been reported to associate through Bem1 protein with actin cytoskeleton (23.Leeuw T. Fourest L.A. Wu C. Chenevert J. Clark K. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Science. 1995; 270: 1210-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It is possible that PASK associates with the cytoskeleton through such an adapter molecule, although further investigation is necessary to identify the cytoskeletal component to which PASK directly binds. Cell fractionation of rat tissues showed that the distribution of PASK between soluble and cytoskeletal fractions varied considerably depending on the tissue type: ∼50% of total PASK was present in the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction of brain and testis, whereas only 10% of total PASK was found in this fraction of adrenal gland and epididymis. PASK was undetectable in the cytoskeletal fraction of PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells. Although the molecular mechanisms that regulate the association of PASK with the cytoskeleton remain to be elucidated, these differences in the distribution of PASK suggest that the interaction between PASK and the cytoskeleton may be regulated by some factor and may reflect different amounts and/or activities of such factors in different tissues. Our results showed that translocation of PASK from the cytosol to cytoskeleton occurred in PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells when these cells were stimulated with severe cellular stresses. The observation that hypertonic stress-induced PASK translocation was unaffected by cytochalasin B or colchicine treatment suggests that PASK translocation is not induced by rearrangement of the cytoskeleton. Cytosolic PASK probably does not associate with actin or tubulin monomers, because none of these proteins was coimmunoprecipitated with PASK from a 100,000 × g supernatant of brain extract by anti-PASK antibody (data not shown). This is also supported by the observation that GST-PASK did not bind to unpolymerized G-actin in vitro. Therefore, we do not believe that cytosolic PASK associated with actin or tubulin monomers translocates to the cytoskeleton by polymerization of these cytoskeletal proteins. PASK translocation was also not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or anisomycin (data not shown), suggesting that PASK translocation is not induced by de novo synthesis of adapter proteins, which bind PASK to the cytoskeleton. In vivo 32P labeling of PC12 cells showed that the phosphorylation level of PASK translocated to the cytoskeleton decreased to ∼40% of that in the cytosol. Thus, it is conceivable that the level of PASK phosphorylation may modulate the affinity of PASK for the target molecule of the cytoskeleton. At this point, it is unclear whether PASK translocation is induced by PASK dephosphorylation. Further experiments using mutants lacking the phosphorylation site(s) will be needed to establish a causal relationship. It has been reported that Ste20-like oxidant stress response kinase-1 and mammalian sterile twenty-like/kinase regulated by stress, Ste20 family members to which PASK is most closely related, are activated by cellular stresses (24.Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25.Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PASK is similarly activated by cellular stresses, PASK was immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-soluble extracts of hypertonic or oxidant stress-stimulated PC12 cells, and its activity was determined in vitro with myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate. However, we could not detect any significant changes in PASK activity, because it was very weak under the assay conditions used (data not shown). Taken together with the observation that cytosolic PASK was constitutively phosphorylated, these results suggest that the phosphorylated PASK in the cytosol may be inactive. Mammalian sterile twenty-like-1 has been reported to be activated by its dephosphorylation (26.Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although PASK activity in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was not determined because of difficulties in immunoprecipitation under nondenaturing conditions, it is possible that only translocated PASK is activated at the cytoskeleton. PASK is localized to a distinct set of cells, including neurons and transporting epithelia such as epithelial cells of brain choroid plexus, distal tubules, and collecting ducts of the kidney, ducts of salivary gland, and parietal cells of the stomach (16.Ushiro H. Tsutsumi T. Suzuki K. Kayahara T. Nakano K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These PASK-containing cells actively transport electrolytes and water to regulate the osmolarity and ionic composition of body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and saliva. As shown here, cytosolic PASK translocates to the cytoskeleton upon stimulation with hypertonic sodium chloride. It is thus conceivable that PASK may be involved in the regulation of cytoskeleton when these cells respond to changes in osmolarity of body fluids. We thank Dr. T. Yoshida and Dr. T. Hayashi for helpful discussions."

To explore the molecular basis for this, a series of mutants were prepared and characterized, in which the possible candidate, Glu-432, was replaced in the rat M1isozyme and its allosteric mutant with the replacement of Ala-398 by Arg. Although these single mutants of Glu-432 remained nearly fully active, similar to the wild type, only the mutants with replacements by Lys and Ala were more efficiently activated by FBP when the enzymes were inhibited by l-phenylalanine. Kinetic analyses and ligand-induced fluorescence quenching studies using the allosteric double mutants indicated that the loss of a negative charge at residue 432 led to a dramatic decrease in the apparent activation constant and apparent K d for FBP. Furthermore, this enhancement was found to be associated with the modification of the FBP-binding site rather than the alteration of the subunit assembly. These findings suggest that Glu-432 hinders the heterotropic allosteric effect by preventing the binding of FBP through a repulsive electrostatic interaction and thereby contributes to its unique unregulated properties, independent of the shifted allosteric transition.

Four different isozymes are known to occur in mammalian tissues, namely the L, R, M1, and M2 isozymes (1.Imamura K. Tanaka T.

The PK-L gene locus encodes for the L and R isozymes, whereas the M1 and M2 isozymes arise from a common gene, the PK-M gene locus (5.Noguchi T. Yamada K. Inoue H. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14366-14371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Noguchi T Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

With the exception of the M1 isozyme, these enzymes are allosteric enzymes and show positive homotropic cooperativity with respect to the substrate, PEP. The allosteric PKs undergo efficient activation in a heterotropic manner by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an intermediate metabolite in the glycolytic pathway, whereas the M1 isozyme is devoid of allosteric properties (1.Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2.Imamura K. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Staal G.E. van Veelen C.W.M. Markers of Human Neuroectodermal Tumors.

For the case of the allosteric PKs, the conformation of the enzyme is converted from the inactive T-state to the active R-state on the binding of ligands such as PEP and FBP. On the other hand, it is known that in the nonallosteric M1 isozyme the equilibrium for the distribution between the T- and R-states is in favor of the R-state even in the absence of the ligands (1.Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 4.Gardenas J.M. Dyson R.D. Strandholm J.J. Markert C.L. Isozymes. 1. Academic Press, New York1975: 523-541Google Scholar). Although allosteric M2 and nonallosteric M1arise from a common gene, mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the transcript produces the structurally different enzymes (6.Noguchi T Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2363-2367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structures of these two isozymes differ in the regions encoded by single exons (exon 9 for M1 and exon 10 for M2). Each exon encodes a stretch of 56 amino acids, which comprises approximately 10% of the total polypeptide sequences of these PKs. Because only 23 amino acids are different in this region, the distinct kinetic properties of the M1 and M2 isozymes must be because of this structural difference (6.Noguchi T Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the region forms the intersubunit contact, it has been suggested that it is involved in cooperative interactions between the subunits (10.Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15.Ikeda Y. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12227-12233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region in the M1 isozyme stabilizes the inactive conformation and thereby shifts the allosteric transition toward the T-state, leading to the development of homotropic cooperativity with respect to PEP. This indicates that the allosteric transition is greatly shifted toward the R-state for the case of the M1isozyme. The unregulated kinetic behavior of the M1 isozymes is due, not only to the consequence of the shifted allosteric transition, but also to insensitivity to FBP-induced activation. Because the allosteric transition of the M1 isozyme is intrinsically shifted toward the active conformation, the isozyme no longer undergoes activation by FBP. However, even under conditions where the transition is shifted to the T-state by either mutations orl-phenylalanine inhibition, the isozyme is not activated by FBP as efficiently as the M2 isozyme. It has been found that an apparent activation constant (Kact (app)) for FBP, which is the concentration of FBP required for one-half activation under defined conditions, is less than 1 μm in the M2 isozyme whereas the Kact (app) value for the M1 isozyme is more than a thousand times higher, as shown by the activation of an allosteric mutant of the rat M1 isozyme and the l-phenylalanine-inhibited rabbit M1 isozyme by FBP (9.Consler T.G. Woodard S.H. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 15.Ikeda Y. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12227-12233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the amino acid sequence of the M1 isozyme, which differs from that of M2, also includes a structural factor that causes a lowering in affinity for FBP. The M1isozyme is believed to be the result of the evolution of a prototypic allosteric PK for energy metabolism in specialized energy-consuming tissues, such as brain and heart. Therefore, the unregulated kinetic behavior, which is based on the shifted allosteric transition, and an insensitivity to FBP would have been acquired during the molecular evolution of the allosteric PK. Although the exact binding site of FBP remained unidentified for a long time, it was recently localized by solving the crystal structure of yeast PK complexed with FBP (16.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The structural analysis revealed that the FBP-binding site involves a loop between the Cβ1 strand and the Cα3 helix and by the Cα5 helix (Fig. 1, A andB). It was also shown that the loop constitutes the binding pocket for the 6′-phosphate group of FBP. Furthermore, it was found that a portion of the loop is encoded by the alternative spliced exon in mammalian M1 and M2 isozymes. A comparison of the primary structures of mammalian and yeast PKs shows that only residue 432 in the aforementioned loop is different between the rat M1 and M2 isozymes (Fig.1 B). Residue 432 and its equivalent is, unequivocally, glutamic acid in the nonallosteric M1 isozymes and lysine or threonine for the allosteric PKs. This evidence suggests that the residue 432 is critical for the insensitivity to FBP in the M1 isozyme. This study was initiated to explore the issue of whether this specific glutamic acid residue contributes to the unique unregulated properties of the M1 isozyme by means of hindering the binding of FBP and to elucidate the molecular basis involving the residue, in terms of its insensitivity to activation by FBP in the M1 isozyme. In the present study, we introduced amino acid replacements into the candidate residue in the M1 mutant, which had been converted into an allosteric enzyme by the substitution of Ala-398 by Arg (14.Ikeda Y.

This strategy enabled us to evaluate the effect of Glu-432 in terms of changes in the heterotropic allosteric effect, which involves FBP in the M1 isozyme. Restriction endonuclease and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara and New England Biolabs. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate tri-sodium salt was obtained from Sigma, and phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP were from Wako Pure Chemicals and Oriental Yeast, respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase and NADH were products of Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Greiner Japan. Other common chemicals were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals or Nacalai Tesque. The transfer plasmids for the wild-type and mutants of the rat M1 isozyme were constructed by inserting their cDNAs into a transfer vector, pVL1393 (Invitrogen), as described previously (14.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel (17.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), as described previously (18.Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12471-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prior to mutagenesis, the SphI-KpnI 0.2-kilobase fragments of the cDNAs of wild-type rat PK-M1 and the A398R mutant, in which Ala 398 had been replaced with Arg (14.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), were subcloned into a pTV119N vector (Takara). Subsequently,HindIII-KpnI fragments, excised from the resultant plasmids were then ligated to pBluescript SK+. The uracil-substituted single-stranded templates were prepared fromEscherichia coli CJ236, which had been transformed by the plasmids. The uracil templates were used with synthetic oligonucleotide primers to replace Glu-432. The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are as follows: 5′-GATAGTTCTGACGAAGTCCGGAAGGAGTGC-3′ for replacement by Lys (designated E432K or A398R/E432K), 5′-GATAGTTCTGACGGCTAGCGGCAGGAGTGC-3′ for replacement by Ala (E432A or A398R/E432A), and 5′-ATAGTTCTGACGGACTCCGGAAGGAGTGCTCACCAAGTG-3′ for replacement by Asp (E432D or A398R/E432D). The resulting mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing using a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373A), as were the entire sequences, which were subjected to mutagenesis. After replacing the corresponding sequence of the wild-type M1 with the mutated sequences, the transfer plasmids for the mutant enzymes were constructed in a manner similar to that of the wild-type enzyme and were used for transfection. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf) 21 cells were maintained at 27 °C in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 3.33 g/l yeastolate, 3.33 g/l lactalbumin hydrolysate, and 100 mg/l kanamycine. Recombinant viruses were manipulated as described (19.Piwnica-Worms H. Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

The purified transfer plasmids containing the mutant PK-M1 cDNAs (1 μg) were co-transfected into 5 × 105 Sf21 cells with 10 ng of BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) using the Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) method (20.Felgner P.L.

Media containing the recombinant viruses generated by homologous recombinations were collected 6 days after transfection. The recombinant viruses were further amplified to more than 5 × 107 plaque forming units/ml prior to use. 2 × 108 Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant viruses carrying either the wild-type or mutant PK-M1 at a multiplicity of infection in excess of eight. The infected cells were harvested about 90 h postinfection for purification of the expressed proteins. Recombinant PK-M1 mutant enzymes were purified from the baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells as described previously (14.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,15.Ikeda Y. Noguchi T. J. Biol.

The purified enzymes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis on 10% gels, according to Laemmli (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A standard assay for PK activity was performed at 37 °C using 2 mm of both PEP and ADP in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, and 0.5 mm FBP (pH 7.5) as described previously (1.Imamura K. Tanaka T. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 150-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This substrate mixture also contained 17 units/ml of lactate dehydrogenase and 0.17 mm NADH to monitor the release of pyruvate by the change in absorbance at 340 nm. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of pyruvate/min. Enzymatic activity was assayed at 37 °C using various concentrations of PEP and ADP. The condition used for kinetics was the same as above except for the substrates and effector. In the assessment of parameters for one substrate, the concentration of the other was fixed at 2 mm. Twelve different concentrations of PEP between 5 μm and 2.0 mmwere used to obtain kinetic parameters for the substrate. Parameters for ADP were determined with seven concentrations of the substrate from 31.3 μm to 2.0 mm. The release of pyruvate was monitored using a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer by coupling with the lactate dehydrogenase-NADH system. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the data for varying concentrations of PEP to the Hill equation. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to determine parameters for ADP. These calculations were carried out using nonlinear regression analysis based on the Marquardt algorithm. When the value for Kact (app) for FBP was estimated, the activity was determined using various concentrations of FBP with 100 μm PEP and 2 mm ADP in the absence of l-phenylalanine for the A398R and the double mutants or in the presence of 2 mml-phenylalanine for the wild type, E432A, E432K, and E432D. On the other hand, 1 mm PEP and 2 mm ADP were used with various concentrations of l-phenylalanine for the inhibition. Other assay conditions were the same as the standard assay of PK. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching induced by FBP was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Shimazu RF5000). The wavelengths used were 280 nm for excitation and 350 nm for emission. Fluorescence was measured at 37 °C in 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 5 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.5), and various concentrations of FBP. Protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml. Fluorescence quenching (Q) was calculated according to Equation 1,Q=(F0−F)/F0Equation 1 where F 0 and F are fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of FBP, respectively. In the increasing phase of fluorescence quenching, the data were fitted to Equation 2 to determine K d for FBP,Q=Qmax×[FBP] n/(Kdn+[FBP] n)Equation 2 where Q max represents the maximal quenching, K d the dissociation constant, andn the Hill coefficient. Subunit assembly of the PK-M1 mutants was examined by size exclusion chromatography using an HPLC system equipped with a TSKgel G3000SWXL (7.8 × 300, TOSOH). The solvent used was 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m KCl and 5 mmMgSO4, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. Twenty μl of a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml enzymes were injected into the column. The eluted proteins were monitored by absorbance at 210 nm. Protein contents were determined according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (24.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The recombinant baculoviruses that carried the cDNAs for the PK-M1 mutants in which replacement of Glu-432 by Ala, Lys, and Asp had been made in the wild type and the A398R mutant were prepared and used for expression of the recombinant proteins. The mutant enzymes were successfully expressed in yields of 10–20% of the total soluble proteins, as described previously for the wild-type and other mutants of the rat M1 isozyme (14.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were purified from the baculovirus-infected cells, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified proteins indicated single bands of 57 kDa corresponding to the single subunits in all mutants (data not shown). The single mutants in which Glu-432 was replaced by Ala, Lys, and Asp were subjected to kinetic analysis to examine the effects of these replacements on the kinetic properties of the protein. As shown in Fig.2 and TableI, these replacements did not significantly alter the kinetic properties of the PK-M1, either in the presence or absence of 1 mm FBP, suggesting that these mutations at Glu-432 have little effect on the intrinsically shifted equilibrium of the allosteric transition. In addition, these amino acid replacements appeared to lead to no alteration of catalysis or the binding of substrates, PEP and ADP, as shown by theV max and K m values, which were similar to those of the wild type. When the wild type and these single mutants were inhibited by various concentrations ofl-phenylalanine, which is known to inhibit PK via shifting the equilibrium toward the inactive T-state (9.Consler T.G.

As shown in Fig. 3, however, it was found that the E432A and E432K mutants are activated by FBP much more efficiently than the wild type and the E432D mutant, when the susceptibility of the wild type and the single mutants to FBP was examined by evaluating the activation of the enzymes inhibited by 2 mml-phenylalanine. This suggests that the existence of a negatively charged side chain of the residue 432 specifically prevents the activation of the enzyme by FBP but that it has no other effects on the kinetic properties.Table IKinetic parameters for the wild-type and mutants of rat PK-M1PEPaAssayed with 2.0 mm ADP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, and 5.0 mmMgSO4 (pH 7.5).,bStandard errors were within 5% in all parameters.EnzymeFBP(−)dIn the absence of FBP.1 mm FBPADPbStandard errors were within 5% in all parameters.,cAssayed with 2.0 mm PEP in 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, and 5.0 mm MgSO4(pH 7.5).Vmax (app)S 0.5Hill coefficientVmax (app)S 0.5Hill coefficientVmax (app)Km (app)μmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgμmμmol/min/mgmmWild type530581.2540551.26600.56E432A520661.3490531.06800.70E432K550701.2530541.16900.62E432D470471.0510511.06700.66A398R5603902.75902202.06500.50A398R/E432A5605301.9540841.36000.52A398R/E432K5505102.5570771.36700.57A398R/E432D5203702.15002802.76000.45a Assayed with 2.0 mm ADP in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, and 5.0 mmMgSO4 (pH 7.5).b Standard errors were within 5% in all parameters.c Assayed with 2.0 mm PEP in 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 m KCl, and 5.0 mm MgSO4(pH 7.5).d In the absence of FBP.

These double mutants would be useful in investigating the function of Glu-432 in the heterotropic allosteric effect by FBP, because the A398R single mutant has been found to behave as a typical allosteric PK, such as PK-M2 with exception of activation by FBP (14.Ikeda Y. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20495-20501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of A398R/E432A, A398R/E432K, and A398R/E432D showed that these double mutants exhibited typical sigmoidal responses to PEP in the absence of FBP (Fig. 2), and thus it was found that these double mutants retain cooperative properties with respect to PEP in a manner similar to the single mutant, A398R. The Km (app) for ADP in the double mutants and Vmax (app) were essentially the same as those for the wild type and the A398R mutant (Table I). The additional mutations introduced into Glu-432 appeared to lead to a slight modification in the homotropic allosteric effect, as compared with the A398R. However, the S 0.5values and the Hill coefficients of the double mutants were still much higher than those of their corresponding single mutants, which lacked the Ala-398 mutation. These suggest that the replacements of Glu-432 have only modest effects on the equilibrium of the allosteric transition. The presence of 1 mm FBP in the assay resulted in left-shifted plots, as shown in Fig. 2, thus indicating that all the double mutants and the A398R could be activated by FBP. However, whereas the A398R/E432A and A398R/E432K mutants displayed nearly hyperbolic responses to varying concentrations of PEP in the presence of 1 mm FBP, the A398R and A398R/E432D mutants continued to show significant sigmoidal curvatures under the same conditions. TheirS 0.5 values and Hill coefficients were still higher (Table I). Thus, it was found that the A398R and A398R/E432D mutants were not fully activated, even in the presence of 1 mm FBP. On the other hand, the S 0.5values and Hill coefficients of the A398R/E432A and A398R/E432K were very similar to those of the wild type. To compare the susceptibility of the A398R and the double mutants to FBP by estimating the Kact (app) for FBP, the enzyme activities were determined in the presence of various concentrations of FBP with the fixed concentrations of 100 μm PEP and 2 mm ADP (Fig. 4). TheKact (app) values for the A398R and A398R/E432D mutants were as high as 900 and 1700 μm, respectively, whereas Kact (app) for A398R/E432A and for A398R/E432K was much lower, 77 and 33 μm, respectively. It was found that the FBP-induced activation of the A398R and A398R/E432D mutants, both of which have negatively charged side chains at position 432, is much less efficient than the other double mutants which lack a negative charge at position 432. Furthermore, because both replacements by a nonpolar amino acid and one which contained a positively charged side chain decreased theKact (app) to a similar extent, it seems unlikely that a positive-charged side chain plays an important role in the efficiency of activation by FBP. Slight decreases in the activities observed at extremely high concentration of FBP could be because of the interaction of the effector with the active site for ADP and/or PEP because the effector has two phosphoryl groups common to both the substrates. These findings strongly indicate that the mutations leading to a loss of the negative charge at the residue 432 cause a dramatic enhancement in activation by FBP. These results suggest that the negatively charged γ-carboxyl group of Glu-432 serves to hinder the heterotropic allosteric effect involving FBP in the M1isozyme and are consistent with the results obtained from the analysis of the single mutants. It is well known that allosteric PKs undergo conformational changes, which reflect the allosteric transition from the inactive T-state to the active R-state, on the binding of FBP, and this conformational change can be detected as a change of the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan (25.Murcott T.H.L. Gutfreund H. Muirhead H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3811-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26.Oberfelder R.W. Lee L.L.-Y. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3813-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the enzyme conformation in the FBP-bound state displays a fluorescent intensity that is different from that without the effector, the binding of FBP can be titrated by monitoring the change of fluorescence intensity (25.Murcott T.H.L. Gutfreund H. Muirhead H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3811-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of the replacements of Glu-432 by various amino acids on the binding of FBP, the apparent dissociation constant (Kd (app)) for the effector was estimated by monitoring the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching that results from the binding of FBP for a series of the allosteric PK-M1 mutants. As shown in Fig.5, the increase in fluorescence quenching was observed in the concentration range of FBP where each enzyme was activated. When Kd (app) for FBP was calculated from the fluorescence quenching data, the values for A398R/E432A and A398R/E432K were 79 and 48 μm, respectively, whereas the values for the A398R single mutant and A398R/E432D were 490 and 1400 μm, respectively. These Kd (app) values are in good agreement with the Kact (app) values determined on the basis of the activation. However, it has been reported for an allosteric PK, the M2isozyme, that this isozyme undergoes reversible subunit assembly, the equilibrium of which is affected by the binding of FBP (34.Friesen R.H.E. Chin A.J. Ledman D.W. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2949-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35.Friesen R.H.E. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14772-14779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the allosteric M2 isozyme, the absence of FBP appears to induce the dissociation of the subunits, and the binding of the effector may possibly depend on the state of the subunit assembly. If the replacement of Ala-398 by Arg in PK-M1 shifts the equilibrium of the subunit assembly and then the second replacements of Glu-432 by Ala and Lys reverse this altered equilibrium, it is possible that the decreased Kact (app) orKd (app) in the A398R/E432A and A398R/E432K mutants might reflect the modulated equilibrium of the subunit assembly, rather than the modification of the FBP-binding pocket. To test this possibility, the subunit assembly of the allosteric mutants was explored by analytical size exclusion chromatography at the same enzyme concentrations as were used for fluorescence quenching study. As shown in Fig. 6, all the allosteric mutants, the A398R single mutant and the double mutants, form tetrameric structures even in the absence of FBP in a manner similar to the wild type and an authentic rabbit muscle PK. The results indicate that the amino acid replacements of Ala-398 and Glu-432 do not affect the equilibrium of the subunit assembly, and thus suggests that the decreased Kact (app) and Kd (app) in the A398R/E432A and A398R/E432K mutants are because of the modulation of the FBP-binding pocket rather than the alteration of the subunit assembly. Therefore, as revealed by the fluorescence quenching study, it may be concluded that the negatively charged side chains of the residue-432 serve to directly prevent the binding of FBP and thereby impair the heterotropic allosteric effect involving FBP. As reported previously, whereas the mutant M1 isozyme (A398R) in which Ala-398 has been replaced by Arg, the corresponding residue in the allosteric M2 isozyme, exhibits a homotropic allosteric effect with respect to PEP, this mutant is still not efficiently activated by FBP. The aim of the present study was to identify a residue that hinders the activation by FBP in the M1 isozyme of PK, and to elucidate the molecular basis for the lack of the efficient heterotropic allosteric effect involving FBP in this isozyme. It would be difficult to examine the involvement of the residue in terms of its insensitivity to FBP without this useful mutant, because the M1 isozyme is fully active even in the absence of FBP. The findings reported herein suggest that Glu-432, the conserved glutamic acid residue among the M1 isozymes from various species, serves to impair the heterotropic allosteric effect by preventing the binding of the allosteric effector, FBP. However, this inhibitory effect of the residue on the binding of FBP does not appear to be because of a loss of the FBP-binding residue, resulting from the replacement of a certain amino acid of importance in the binding by glutamic acid, but rather it is more likely that the conserved Glu-432 plays a dominant negative role in the binding of FBP. Furthermore, it also appears that a negative charge on this residue is required for inhibiting the binding of FBP. Our results are, in part, consistent with suggestions made on the basis of crystallographic analysis (16.Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, although the replacement of Glu-432 in the rat M1 isozyme by the corresponding residue in the rat M2 isozyme, Lys, substantially decreased theKact (app) for FBP, the value is still about 100 times higher than that of the M2 isozyme (15.Ikeda Y. Noguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12227-12233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We thus conclude that, not only a difference at residue 432 accounts for the extremely high affinity for FBP in M2 isozymes, but other residues or structural factors may also be involved. Nevertheless, the present study clearly indicates that a negatively charged side chain of the residue 432, the γ-carboxyl group in glutamic acid, is of critical importance for the M1 isozyme to lose its susceptibility to FBP. The loop between the Cβ1 strand and the Cα3 helix and a portion of the Cα5 helix, all of which participate in the FBP-binding site, of the M1 isozyme from rabbit muscle were compared with the corresponding structures of FBP-complexed yeast PK (Fig.7). The structures of the mammalian M1isozyme were aligned to those of the yeast enzyme by fitting the coordinate data for the α-carbons using the computer program, MolView. Superimposition of these structures indicates that the side chain of the arginine residue (Arg-488 in the M1 isozyme), which is involved in an interaction with the 1′-phosphate of FBP, is positioned analogous to that of the yeast PK, even though the γ-carboxylate of Glu-432 in mammalian may possibly interact with the guanidino group of an arginine residue, which is situated 4.7 Å from the carboxylate group. In addition, the Glu-432 causes no disorder in the loop involved in the interaction with the 6′-phosphate group of FBP, and it is also unlikely that the γ-carboxyl group occupies the binding pocket by mimicking the phosphate, as shown in this modeling. Glu-432 does not appear to prevent the binding of FBP via impairing the interactions between Arg-488 and the 1′-phosphate of FBP because the mutant in which Glu-432 was replaced by Asp also exhibited the similar effect on the interaction with the effector, despite its shorter side chain. This replacement would be expected to lead to a longer distance between the carboxyl group and Arg-488, therefore weakening their interaction, if the carboxyl group at the residue-432 significantly interacted with the guanidino group of the arginine residue. On the other hand, the γ-carboxylate of Glu-432 appears to be about 4.1 Å away from the 1′-phosphate of FBP and more than 6.7 Å from the other phosphate, as estimated in the superimposition of FBP into the M1 isozyme structure by alignment. This suggests that Glu-432 serves to hinder the binding of FBP through its repulsive electrostatic interaction with the 1′-phosphate, rather than the 6′-phosphate. The higher Kact (app) andKd (app) values found in the case of the replacement of Glu-432 by Asp in the A398R mutant suggest more enhanced repulsive interactions with FBP, and this could be because of an interaction with 6′-phosphate, in addition to that with the 1′-phosphate group. The M1 isozymes have lost the regulatory properties in which glycolytic metabolites, such as PEP and FBP control the enzyme activity, and the substitution of glutamate for the residue 432 is one of the most critical substitutions to have accumulated during the molecular evolution of the PKs, because the substitution led to a loss of regulation by FBP. However, sole replacement of Glu-432 by any amino acid examined did not appear to significantly affect the persistent active conformation of the M1 isozyme, suggesting that the allosteric transition is intrinsically shifted toward the R-state in the M1 isozyme independently of the Glu-432 residue. This shifted allosteric transition toward the R-state would be sufficient for the loss of regulations by both PEP and FBP, and it is entirely possible that Glu-432 is not necessarily required for such unregulated properties. In this respect, it may be possible that the replacement by Glu at position 432, which had occurred in the allosteric prototype of the PK-M1, might be an excess step in the evolutional process for the acquisition of the unregulated properties. However, the absolute conservation of the glutamic acid residue in the M1 isozymes suggests that the residue may be required for the isozyme to avoid any unknown and/or more complicated regulating mechanism involving FBP. Therefore, the elucidation of the significance of the glutamic acid residue leads us to understand the regulating mechanism(s) of PKs in more detail and thereby to provide new insights into the regulation of the glycolytic pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1979965299,"Notch, a cell surface receptor, is required for producing different types of cells during development ofDrosophila melanogaster. Notch activates expression of one set of genes in response to ligand Delta and another set of genes in response to ligand Wingless. The means by which Notch initiates these different intracellular activities was examined in this study. Cultured cells expressing Notch were treated with Delta or Wingless, and the effect on Notch was examined by Western blotting. Treatment of cells with Delta resulted in accumulation of ∼120-kDa Notch intracellular domain molecules in the cytoplasmic fraction. This form of Notch did not accumulate in cells treated with Wingless, but the ∼350-kDa full-length Notch molecules accumulated. These results indicate that N responds differently to binding by Delta and Wingless, and suggest that although the Delta signal is transduced by the Notch intracellular domain released from the plasma membrane, the Wingless signal is transduced by the Notch intracellular domain associated with the plasma membrane."

Fluorescence measurements of this reaction revealed a −22-nm blue shift in the emission peak of NADH and a ∼15-fold increase in peak intensity, characteristics of tightly bound NADH that were not seen by simply mixing NADH and enzyme. The fluorescent properties of the bound NADH can be ascribed to a hydrophobic environment and a rigidly held, open conformation of NADH, features in accord with the known crystal structure of the enzyme. Considerable fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan 327 in the active site to the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH was seen. Upon addition of the eIF5A precursor, utilization of the enzyme-bound NADH for reduction of the eIF5A-imine intermediate to deoxyhypusine was reflected by a rapid decrease in the NADH fluorescence, indicating a transient hydride transfer mechanism as an integral part of the reaction. The number of NADH molecules bound approached four/enzyme tetramer; not all of the bound NADH was available for reduction of the eIF5A-imine intermediate. Deoxyhypusine is a modified lysine residue.

In this complex reaction, the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine is transferred to a specific lysine in the eIF5A1 precursor to form a deoxyhypusine (N ε-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) residue. The final reaction of hypusine synthesis is carried out by a specific deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. The fully modified eIF5A in its mature, hypusine-containing form is required for eukaryotic cell proliferation, although its mode of action is not yet clear (1.Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E.

The overall reaction has been postulated to occur in four steps (Scheme FSI), including two imine intermediates in the transfer of the aminobutyl group from spermidine, as follows: 1) spermidine + NAD → dehydrospermidine + NADH; 2) dehydrospermidine + enzyme → enzyme(Lys)-imine intermediate + diaminopropane; 3) enzyme-imine intermediate + eIF5A precursor → eIF5A(Lys)-imine intermediate + enzyme; 4) eIF5A-imine intermediate + [H] → deoxyhypusine in the eIF5A intermediate.Direct evidence has been presented for the first two steps (8.Wolff E.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the details of the final two steps have remained elusive. Steps 1 and 2 occur in the absence of eIF5A precursor and can be measured by following the release of 1,3-diaminopropane and the formation of the enzyme-imine intermediate, which can be trapped with cyanoborohydride (9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the presence of the eIF5A precursor the final two steps are rapidly completed. NADH generated in the initial dehydrogenation (step 1) has been presumed to be used in the final reduction step (step 4) because the purified enzyme does not seem to require addition of a reducing agent. However, there has been no direct evidence for the role of NADH in the final step, and it was not known whether NADH remains bound to the enzyme or first dissociates and reassociates with the enzyme at step 4.The crystal structure of human deoxyhypusine synthase with bound NAD has been obtained at a resolution of 2.2 Å (10.Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homotetramer of two pairs of identical, tightly associated dimers of the 41-kDa subunits. There are two active sites in each dimer interface running anti-parallel to each other for a total of four potential active sites, each capable of binding NAD in a specific orientation with respect to a presumed spermidine-binding cavity. Under the conditions of crystallization with excess NAD, the tetramer contains four molecules of NAD that are completely buried in the subunit interfaces. The arrangement of the NAD in a partly extended configuration is similar to that of many dehydrogenases (11.Eklund, H., and Brändén, C.-I. (1987) in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects(Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part A, Vol. I, 1st Ed., pp. 51–98, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 12.Bell C.E. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2084-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) The NAD-binding site of each subunit is a fairly typical “Rossman fold” (13.Rossman M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Oxidation-Reduction, Part A: Dehydrogenases (I), Electron transfer (I). 3rd Ed. XI. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar), which places the NAD adjacent to the spermidine-binding site. The nicotinamide ring would be in close juxtaposition to the N–C bond of spermidine that is dehydrogenated. The access of solvent to the active site region, and the dissociation of bound nucleotide, although possible, would appear to be severely limited without conformational change.The characteristic absorption of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH, and the fluorescence emission of this reduced nucleotide, have been useful in studies of dehydrogenases. NADH in water or buffer emits a strong fluorescence with a peak at 457–465 nm when excited in the region of 340 nm. However, if NADH is bound to one of several dehydrogenases or in the presence of nonpolar solvents, the fluorescence emission peak is blue-shifted (−20 ± 5 nm), and its intensity is markedly enhanced (11.Eklund, H., and Brändén, C.-I. (1987) in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects(Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part A, Vol. I, 1st Ed., pp. 51–98, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). These facts, plus the increased sensitivity of fluorescence methods, prompted us to follow the formation and characteristics of NADH during the steps of the deoxyhypusine synthase-catalyzed reaction. In this communication we present evidence to show: 1) that the NADH remains enzyme-associated during the reaction and 2) that the hydride ion generated by the oxidation of spermidine is preserved for reduction of the eIF5A-imine intermediate in step 4.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we have addressed the role of NAD and NADH in the reaction catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase. Specifically, we have described the dehydrogenation of spermidine with reduction of NAD to NADH and the use of NADH for reduction of the eIF5A-imine intermediate in the final step. The proposed overall reaction is shown in Scheme FSI; the shaded ovals indicate enzyme forms to which NADH is bound. By utilizing the known fluorescent properties of NADH, we found that: 1) NADH is generated by in situ reduction of enzyme-bound NAD and remains associated with the enzyme; 2) a hydride ion that has been abstracted from spermidine and is present on the enzyme as tightly bound NADH (I, II, and III) is subsequently donated (in step 4) to the eIF5A-imine intermediate (III) on the enzyme, thus constituting an “internal hydride transfer”; and 3) the proximity of Trp327 supports fluorescence resonance energy transfer from this tryptophan to NADH in the active site.This study presents the first experimental evidence for direct reutilization of the hydride ion of NADH in deoxyhypusine synthesis. This type of internal transfer mechanism involving NAD and NADH in a single protein is rare but not unprecedented, as shown for enzymes that have tightly bound NAD/NADH such as E. coliUDP-glucose-4-epimerase (26.Maxwell E.S. deRobichon-Szulmeister H.

Frey first used the term “transient hydride transfer,” which we have adopted here, for the mechanism in which a critical hydride ion is transferred from one intermediate to another via NAD/NADH (27.Frey, P. A. (1987) in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects (Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part B, Vol. II, 1st Ed., pp. 461–511, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 32.Liu Y.

The mechanism employed by deoxyhypusine synthase appears to be similar in that there is an NAD-NADH cycle in which hydride transfer from the first substrate to the last intermediate takes place via bound nucleotides. It differs in that NAD does not stay tightly associated with the enzyme, because NAD addition is required for activity (33.Chen K.Y. Dou Q.P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 34.Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fluorescence offers a unique opportunity to study NADH binding in the protein, without requiring separation techniques and to gain information on its environment in terms of hydrophobicity, immobilization, and interaction with nearby residues. The region around the nicotinamide ring of NAD in the crystal structure of the complex with deoxyhypusine synthase (10.Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has substantial nonpolar characteristics. The closest hydrophobic amino acid residues and the distance of closest contact with the nicotinamide ring of NAD are Ile166 (3.70 Å), Ala132 (5.12 and 5.31 Å), Trp327 (5.49 Å), Tyr 176 (5.49 Å), Phe54 (6.52Å), and Val 285 (7.8 Å). In addition, the β carbons of Asp 316 and Ser105 and the α carbons of Gly133 and Gly239 are also in close contact (∼4 Å). The residues above in italics are on the monomer that has the spermidine binding pocket, which is otherwise largely hydrophilic; this arrangement is in accord with the generalization of Rossman that the nicotinamide ring is usually buried with one face toward hydrophobic residues and the other toward hydrophilic ones (13.Rossman M.G. Liljas A. Brändén C.-I. Banaszak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Oxidation-Reduction, Part A: Dehydrogenases (I), Electron transfer (I). 3rd Ed. XI. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar). The blue shift of the bound NADH or of NADH in tetrahydrofuran is consistent with such an environment. Compared with the ∼15-fold increase in fluorescence of NADH bound to deoxyhypusine synthase, the increase in peak intensity in 90% tetrahydrofuran was only 3-fold that of the same concentration of NADH in buffer, suggesting that there may be additional factors affecting the enhancement of fluorescence emission. One is the relief of both static and collisional quenching between the adenine and dihydronicotinamide moieties that occurs in the “closed” conformation of NADH in aqueous solution, which has been cited by Weber and others (20.Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21.Velick S.F. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When bound to an enzyme, the NADH generally assumes a more “open” conformation, increasing the distance between the two ring systems and thus increasing the fluorescence emission (20.Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of NAD bound to deoxyhypusine synthase, the NAD exhibits a moderately extended conformation, with approximately 12 Å between the adenine and nicotinamide rings (10.Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further stabilizing the open configuration is the fact that the NAD is deeply buried in the dimer interface between two identical monomers, in a binding site where the adenine and ribose moieties have hydrogen bond contacts with at least 9 residues, mostly on one monomer. This fixation also implies that the whole NADH molecule will be immobilized, which also contributes to enhanced fluorescence, as has been observed with other ligands (37.Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11836-11843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with NADH by increasing the viscosity (22.Gafni A. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3165-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and with NAD(H) in enzyme-bound forms (20.Scott T.G. Spencer R.D. Leonard N.J. Weber G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 687-695Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21.Velick S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 1455-1467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A combination of these factors may explain the relatively high fluorescence intensity seen with NADH bound to deoxyhypusine synthase.A further insight into the interactions in the active site derives from nonradiative energy transfer from the excited state of tryptophan(s) to the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH, assuming that the position of NADH in the protein is similar to that of NAD in the crystal structure (10.Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four tryptophan residues in each monomer, three on the same monomer as the NAD binding site (Trp182, Trp201, and Trp223) are close enough for fluorescence resonance energy transfer, because the indole rings are 14.81, 20.19, and 20.75 Å, respectively, from the nicotinamide ring of NAD. However, the fourth tryptophan, Trp327, is part of the active site, and the indole ring of Trp327 is only 5.42 Å from the nicotinamide ring of NAD in the crystal structure, although it is across the dimer interface. Despite the relatively unfavorable 70° angle between the two ring systems, Trp327 appears to contribute the bulk of the substantial fluorescence resonance energy transfer observed with deoxyhypusine synthase. This conclusion is confirmed by use of the W327A mutant, in which the energy transfer was largely abolished. The small residual energy transfer (∼8%) may come from the more distal tryptophan residues.A four-step pathway of the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction was proposed on the basis of earlier results (8.Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Reduction of NAD to NADH in step 1 was demonstrated in experiments in which 3H from [5-3H]spermidine was transferred stereospecifically to NAD in the pro-R position to generate [4R-NADH] (8.Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus deoxyhypusine synthase is an R (or A)-specific dehydrogenase. The successive transiminations of steps 2 and 3 were postulated on the basis of the identification of a specific enzyme-imine intermediate (9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The current NADH fluorescence data complement the earlier studies and provide further insights into the mechanism and dynamics of the deoxyhypusine synthesis reaction (SchemeFSI). The steady state level of enzyme-bound NADH achieved either in the presence or absence of eIF5A precursor represents a balanced state of all the intermediate reactions. At present, the relative rates of the individual steps and the rate-limiting steps are not known for the complete reaction. In the case of the partial reaction in the absence of eIF5A precursor (steps 1 and 2), the rapid initial increase in NADH fluorescence (Fig. 2) corresponds to the kinetics of rapid spermidine cleavage, as measured by appearance of 1,3-diaminopropane, and accumulation of enzyme-imine intermediate in the complex II, detected by reduction with NaBH3CN (9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The NADH presumably exists primarily in the complex with enzyme-imine intermediate (II), with very little as complex I, even at the early time points, as the maximal enzyme intermediate was found at 2 min (9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The enzyme-imine intermediate undergoes a slow, abortive reaction to generate Δ1-pyrroline (8.Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The maintenance of a steady NADH fluorescence after the initial burst indicates that the total amount of NADH bound to the enzyme does not change during the slow degradation of the enzyme-imine intermediate in II. This finding suggests that after cleavage of Δ1-pyrroline from the imine intermediate, the enzyme still retains NADH as the complex E-NH. However, the continuing slow release of 1,3-diaminopropane must require an equally slow dissociation of NADH from E-NH to regenerate free enzyme and therefore to initiate a new cycle.When eIF5A precursor is added to allow completion of the reaction, the pool of available complex II is rapidly depleted (Fig. 4), although it is clear that not all of the NADH fluorescence disappears. Whereas NADH in the complex II is available for the complete reaction, upon addition of eIF5A, the NADH from E-NH is not. The fact that not all of the NADH was reoxidized could be due to nonutilizable NADH in this E-NH pool, due to lack of access of eIF5A precursor to all the usable NADH (in intermediate form II), or due to steric hindrance, for example. In this regard, it is intriguing to note that the predominant species of the deoxyhypusine synthase-eIF5A precursor complex was identified as the complex of one enzyme tetramer and one eIF5A monomer (38.Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Dimitriadis E.K. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Note that the extent of the rapid decrease in NADH fluorescence upon eIF5A precursor addition was dependent on the amount of eIF5A and was less pronounced at a later time point (Fig. 4, compare curves 1and 2). 5E. C. Wolff, unpublished data. This observation suggests that the relative amount of E-NH versuscomplex II increased with longer incubation, i.e. that the pool of unavailable NADH was increasing with time, in the absence of the eIF5A precursor. Even under conditions where the enzyme is turning over rapidly, a significant fraction of NADH could be sequestered in E-NH, as well as in complexes I, II, and III, because NADH fluorescence was still observed in the complete reaction mixture containing eIF5A precursor.In conclusion, fluorescence analysis has permitted the partial characterization of individual steps in the complex sequence catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase. The findings reported here are in agreement with, and extend, earlier enzymatic data obtained by different methods (8.Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14.Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence parameters such as the blue shift, hydrophobicity around the NADH, fluorescent resonance energy transfer and the role of Trp327 are consistent with the location of the amino acid residues in the active site and with the observed open conformation of NAD. They provide evidence for the tightly bound nature of the NADH and reutilization of its hydride ion. This analysis also suggests an interrelationship between the NADH-enzyme complex forms that depends on the relative rate constants of the individual steps and on the availability of the eIF5A precursor. Deoxyhypusine synthase (EC 1.1.1.249) is responsible for the first reaction in the posttranslational synthesis of hypusine (N ε-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) in a single eukaryotic protein, the eIF5A1 precursor. In this complex reaction, the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine is transferred to a specific lysine in the eIF5A1 precursor to form a deoxyhypusine (N ε-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) residue. The final reaction of hypusine synthesis is carried out by a specific deoxyhypusine hydroxylase. The fully modified eIF5A in its mature, hypusine-containing form is required for eukaryotic cell proliferation, although its mode of action is not yet clear (1.Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E.

NADH generated in the initial dehydrogenation (step 1) has been presumed to be used in the final reduction step (step 4) because the purified enzyme does not seem to require addition of a reducing agent. However, there has been no direct evidence for the role of NADH in the final step, and it was not known whether NADH remains bound to the enzyme or first dissociates and reassociates with the enzyme at step 4. The crystal structure of human deoxyhypusine synthase with bound NAD has been obtained at a resolution of 2.2 Å (10.Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homotetramer of two pairs of identical, tightly associated dimers of the 41-kDa subunits. There are two active sites in each dimer interface running anti-parallel to each other for a total of four potential active sites, each capable of binding NAD in a specific orientation with respect to a presumed spermidine-binding cavity. Under the conditions of crystallization with excess NAD, the tetramer contains four molecules of NAD that are completely buried in the subunit interfaces. The arrangement of the NAD in a partly extended configuration is similar to that of many dehydrogenases (11.Eklund, H., and Brändén, C.-I. (1987) in Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes, Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects(Dolphin, D., Poulson, R., and Avramovic, O., eds) Part A, Vol. I, 1st Ed., pp. 51–98, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 12.Bell C.E.

The nicotinamide ring would be in close juxtaposition to the N–C bond of spermidine that is dehydrogenated. The access of solvent to the active site region, and the dissociation of bound nucleotide, although possible, would appear to be severely limited without conformational change. The characteristic absorption of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH, and the fluorescence emission of this reduced nucleotide, have been useful in studies of dehydrogenases. NADH"

Analysis of 2.6 megabases of sequence from the tip of the X chromosome of Drosophila identifies 273 genes. Cloned DNAs from the characteristic bulbous structure at the tip of the X chromosome in the region of the broad complex display an unusual pattern of in situ hybridization. Sequence analysis revealed that this region comprises 154 kilobases of DNA flanked by 1.2-kilobases of inverted repeats, each composed of a 350-base pair satellite related element. Thus, some aspects of chromosome structure appear to be revealed directly within the DNA sequence itself."
https://openalex.org/W2040754829,"In inflammatory conditions of the gut, cytokines are released into the mucosa and submucosa propagating and sustaining the inflammatory response. In CaCo-2 cells, we have shown that various inflammatory cytokines interfere with the secretion of lipids, an effect that is likely caused by the release of a ligand to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. In the present study, the role of the EGF receptor signaling pathway and the effects of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) on triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion were investigated. CaCo-2 cells were incubated with oleic acid to enhance triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion. TNF-α and IL-1β significantly decreased the basolateral secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mass, with IL-1β being more potent. Tyrphostin, an inhibitor of the EGF receptor intrinsic tryosine kinase, prevented or markedly attenuated the decrease in apoB secretion by TNF-α or IL-1β. Both cytokines increased the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by 30 min. Moreover, phosphotyrosine immunoblots of the EGF receptor demonstrated an increase in tyrosine residues phosphorylated by 0.5 and 6.5 h. At both these time points, TNF-α and IL-1β also decreased the binding of EGF to its cell surface receptor. At 6.5 h, activation of the EGF receptor was sustained. In contrast, the early activation of the receptor was only transient as receptor phosphorylation and binding of EGF to its receptor returned to basal levels by 2 h. Preventing ligand binding to the EGF receptor by a receptor-blocking antibody attenuated receptor activation observed after 6.5 h. This did not occur at 0.5 h, suggesting that early activation of the EGF receptor was non-ligand-mediated. Similarly, apoB secretion was inhibited by an early non-ligand-mediated process; whereas at the later time, inhibition of apoB secretion was ligand-mediated. Thus, the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β interfere with the secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins by both early and delayed signaling events mediated by the EGF receptor signaling pathway.

Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1992; 21: 405-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The localized release of inflammatory cytokines into the mucosa and submucosa likely mediates and perpetuates the inflammatory response (2.Fiocchi C. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes, monocyte/macrophages, and mast cells that infiltrate the mucosa are the major source of these inflammatory peptides (3.Brynskov J. Nielsen O.H. Ahnfelt-Ronne I. Bendtzen K. Scand. J.

Recent evidence, however, demonstrates that intestinal epithelial cells also synthesize and secrete a number of inflammatory cytokines (5.Eckmann L. Jung H.C. Schurer-Maly C. Panja A.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that enterocytes, by interacting directly with inflammatory cytokines, participate in and contribute to the various pathophysiological derangements observed in inflammatory conditions of the gut. Evidence in support of such a notion was demonstrated by the ability of inflammatory cytokines to up-regulate the synthesis of acute phase proteins (13.Molmenti E.P. Ziambaras T. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14116-14124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and complement factors (12.Andoh A. Fujiyama Y. Bamba T. Hosoda S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4239-4247PubMed Google Scholar) in cultured human intestinal cells. Cytokines, however, are not the only mediators of inflammation which are released into the mucosa under conditions of inflammation. Several other bioactive molecules such as growth factors, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells (14.Sartor R.B. Gastroenterology. 1994; 106: 533-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with cytokines, these factors act coordinately to regulate the extent of mucosal injury as well as mediate tissue repair. Growth factors EGF1 and TGF-α, ligands to the transmembrane EGF receptor present on intestinal epithelial cells, have been shown to play a significant role in the restitution of mucosal damage in the gut (15.Tarnawski A.S. Jones M.K. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1998; 27: S12-S20Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16.Schultz G. Rotatori D.S. Clark W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Ligand-mediated activation of the EGF receptor triggers a cascade of events resulting in enhanced cell migration and proliferation that serve to repair the denuded surface of the mucosa. Moreover, by mediating the increased production of mucopolysaccharides, prostaglandins, and extracellular matrix components, the EGF receptor likely plays an important role in protecting mucosal surfaces from further injury (17.Konturek J.W. Brzozowski T. Konturek S.J. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1991; 13: S88-S97Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By modulating transport processes such as ion exchange (18.Donowitz M.

The role of the EGF receptor in decreasing the absorptive function of enterocytes in inflammation, however, has not been investigated. Cytokines that are considered proinflammatory, under certain conditions, may also suppress inflammation and promote wound healing and repair (22.Sartor R.B. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23.Wahl S.M. McCartney-Francis N. Mergenhagen S.E. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 258-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Similar to the EGF receptor, they have been shown to mediate cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, deposition of extracellular matrix, and cell motility. Thus, together with the EGF receptor signaling pathway, cytokines likely modulate intestinal epithelial cell function during inflammation. In a previous study, we demonstrated that certain inflammatory cytokines interfered with normal intestinal lipoprotein synthesis and secretion (24.Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed whether cytokines inhibit the secretion of lipoproteins by activating the EGF receptor signaling pathway. The effects of two inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, on EGF receptor activation and triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion were studied in a cultured human intestinal cell line, CaCo-2. The results demonstrate that TNF-α and IL-1β inhibit the secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins by both a rapid and delayed activation of the EGF receptor. This occurs by non-ligand- and ligand-mediated mechanisms, respectively. Recombinant human TNF-α and IL-1β were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis). Carrier-free EGF was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Horseradish peroxidase substrate, SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate kit, and IODO-GEN were purchased from Pierce. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human EGF receptor was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-EGF receptor-blocking antibody (mAb 528), goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and protein A+G-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody and tyrphostin AG1478 were obtained from Calbiochem. Mouse monoclonal antibody to human apoB and rabbit anti-human apoB polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were bought from Biodesign (Kennebunkeport, ME). Recombinant protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Repligen (Cambridge, MA). Oleic acid, BSA, and Glycerol Phosphate Oxidase Trinder Kit were purchased from Sigma. A TMB microwell peroxidase substrate system containing 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and hydrogen peroxide was purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry (Gaithersburg, MD). Nunc 96-well immunoplates were obtained from PGC Scientific (Gaithersburg, MD). CellTiter 96 was from Promega (Madison, WI). 32Pi (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Carrier-free 125I (100 mCi/ml) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). CaCo-2 cells were cultured on T-75 flasks (Corning Glassworks, Corning, NY) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. Once the flasks reached 80% confluence, the cells were split and seeded at a density of 0.2 × 105 cells/well onto polycarbonate micropore membranes (0.4-μm pore size, 6.5-mm diameter) inserted into transwells (Costar, Cambridge, MA). For experiments in which triacylglycerol mass, EGF receptor phosphorylation, and cell surface125I-EGF binding were estimated, cells were subcultured in 24-mm diameter transwells. Cells were fed every other day and were used 14 days after seeding. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed with media, and cytokines were added to the lower chambers in serum-free Hanks' balanced saline solution and 1 m HEPES (HBSS) or M199 and 1m HEPES (M199) containing 0.1% BSA. Control cells received medium containing 0.1% BSA alone. All cells received 250 μm oleic acid and 62.5 μm BSA in the apical chamber. Incubations were carried out for 18 h or less at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% compressed air and 5% CO2. Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by measuring the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase using the CellTiter 96 assay kit as described previously (24.Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This assay is based on the mitochondrial conversion of a tetrazolium salt into a blue formazan product that is released into the medium. After an overnight incubation with the treatments, the release of the colored formazan dye into the medium was measured spectrophotometrically. Compared with control cells, the relative absorbance of the dye released from cells incubated with TNF-α or IL-1β was 0.97 ± 0.09 or 0.96 ± 0.13, respectively. ApoB mass in cells and basal media was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (24.Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the treatments in the media did not interfere with the estimation of apoB mass by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cells were incubated for 18 h with 500 μCi of 32Pi/well in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Treatments were added to the basal wells in the continued presence of labeled inorganic phosphate. After incubation, cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 21 μm leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μm sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 μm sodium fluoride. The cell lysates were precleared by shaking for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose followed by a quick high speed centrifugation. EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from the precleared supernatants by incubating for 18 h with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-human EGF receptor antibody. The antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by incubating with protein A+G-agarose for 1 h at room temperature followed by a brief high speed centrifugation. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and the EGF receptor protein dissociated from the antibody-antigen complex with 30 μl of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer and 15 μl of 0.2 m glycine buffer (pH 2). The protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% porous gels as described previously (25.Doucet J.P. Murphy B.J. Tuana B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed with 7% acetic acid and 5% methanol, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 8 h. The incorporation of labeled inorganic phosphate into the EGF receptor was estimated by scanning the gels on Ambis 4000 biological image analyzer (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA). EGF was iodinated using IODO-GEN reagent as prescribed by Pierce. After treatment with TNF-α or IL-1β, binding of 125I-EGF to cell surface EGF receptors was estimated as described previously (26.Bishop W.P. Wen J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G892-G900PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with M199 and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 0–1000 ng/ml iodinated EGF (0.0003 μCi/ng). From previous experiments it was found that the binding of 100 ng/ml radiolabeled EGF to cell surface EGF receptors plateaus after 2 h of incubation. EGF was diluted in M199 containing 0.1% BSA and added to the lower wells. M199 was added to the upper chambers. After extensive washing with ice-cold M199 containing 0.1% BSA followed by several rinses with M199 alone, cells were scraped in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer and counted in a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was estimated by incubating cells with 5 μg/ml cold EGF in the presence of 50 ng/ml 125I-EGF and did not exceed 5% of the total binding of labeled EGF. The specificity of the binding of EGF to its cell surface receptor in CaCo-2 cells was determined by Bishop and Wen (26.Bishop W.P. Wen J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G892-G900PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the binding of iodinated EGF to cell surfaces is abolished in the presence of the EGF receptor-blocking antibody, mAb 528. Furthermore, when cells were incubated at 4 °C with labeled EGF and then exposed to bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) to cross-link the ligand to its receptor, more than 80% of the EGF bound to cell surfaces was recovered in a band corresponding to the EGF receptor (data not shown). In experiments in which cells were incubated with the cytokines in the presence of mAb 528, the blocking antibody bound to cell surfaces was removed prior to estimation of cell surface binding of labeled EGF. This was accomplished by extensively washing the cells with 100 mm sodium chloride and 500 mm glycine, pH 3, followed by several rinses with M199. Subsequent binding of labeled EGF to control cells incubated with or without mAb 528 was similar, indicating therefore that the stringent wash protocol effectively removed the bound monoclonal antibody from cell surfaces. After incubation with the treatments, EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from precleared cell lysates as described above. The receptor protein was dissociated from the antigen-antibody complex, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 15 V for 18 h. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody diluted 20,000-fold in the blocking buffer. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase diluted 50,000-fold in blocking buffer. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent substrates, wrapped in Saran Wrap, and then exposed to x-ray film. Band densities were scanned on Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx/T scanner, Hewlett Packard (Greely, CO) and quantitated with the computer-assisted program, Sigma Gel, Jandel Scientific (San Rafael, CA). Total protein content in cells was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (27.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triacylglycerol mass in cells was measured using the Glycerol Phosphate Oxidase Trinder Kit as described previously (28.Murthy S. Albright E. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses of data were performed by analysis of variance, Tukey's t test, Student's t test, the least squares method of determining the best fitting straight line, and small sample t tests for parallelism and common intercepts (29.Kleinbaum D.G. Kupper L.L. Applied Regression Analysis and Other Multivariate Methods. Duxbury Press, Wadsworth Publishing Company, Belmont, CA1978: 15-112Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that TNF-α and IL-1β decreased the basolateral secretion of apoB by CaCo-2 cells in the absence of fatty acids, experimental conditions that do not promote the secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (24.Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-G102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the regulation of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion by TNF-α and IL-1β, CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 18 h with increasing concentrations of TNF-α or IL-1β and 250 μm oleic acid. Oleic acid, at this concentration, has been demonstrated in CaCo-2 cells to stimulate the secretion of lipoproteins enriched in triacylglycerols (30.Field F.J. Albright E. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the incubation, the mass of apoB within cells and that secreted into the basolateral medium was estimated. Both TNF-α and IL-1β decreased the secretion of apoB with IL-1β being the more potent cytokine (Table I). Compared with control cells, IL-1β, at concentrations of 0.001 and 0.1 ng/ml, decreased apoB secretion by 30 and 60%, respectively. Higher concentrations of IL-1β did not decrease apoB secretion further. In contrast, compared with the effects of IL-1β, TNF-α decreased apoB secretion to a similar degree but required much higher concentrations, 10 and 100 ng/ml, respectively. Neither TNF-α nor IL-1β altered the amount of apoB mass within cells.Table IEffect of TNF-α and IL-1β on the basolateral secretion of apoB in CaCo-2 cellsBasal mediaCellsapoB ng/wellControl221 ± 420 ± 1TNF-α (ng/ml) 5184 ± 5*19 ± 4 10147 ± 6*22 ± 3 50118 ± 8*21 ± 2 100107 ± 5*25 ± 3IL-1β (ng/ml) 0.001158 ± 5*17 ± 1 0.01138 ± 3*16 ± 2 0.191 ± 7*16 ± 1 193 ± 7*16 ± 3 1098 ± 8*18 ± 2 10095 ± 8*17 ± 2CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 18 h with increasing concentrations of TNF-α or IL-1β dissolved in HBSS containing 0.1% BSA.

A decrease in apoB secretion by cells incubated with either cytokine suggested that TNF-α and IL-1β caused a decrease in the number of lipoprotein particles being secreted. To address the effect of the cytokines on the amount of triacylglycerols carried per lipoprotein particle, cells were incubated for 18 h with oleic acid and 100 ng/ml TNF-α or 10 ng/ml IL-1β. The amount of triacylglycerols within cells and that secreted into the basolateral medium was then estimated. Compared with control cells, the secretion of triacylglycerols by cells incubated with TNF-α was decreased modestly (23.61 ± 2.39 versus 19.48 ± 1.09 μg/mg protein, n = 6, p < 0.05). In cells incubated with IL-1β, less triacylglycerol was secreted compared with control cells or cells incubated with TNF-α (23.61 ± 2.39versus 16.04 ± 0.03 μg/mg protein, p< 0.01, versus TNF-α p < 0.05). Neither TNF-α nor IL-1β altered the amount of triacylglycerols within cells (control cells, 58.71 ± 1.7; TNF-α cells, 61.53 ± 2.37; IL-1β cells, 62.48 ± 2.98 μg/mg; n = 6). Thus TNF-α and IL-1β decrease the secretion of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. We have demonstrated previously that ligand-mediated activation of the EGF receptor decreases the secretion of lipids and apoB in CaCo-2 cells (31.Murthy S. Mathur S. Bishop W.P. Field E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 206-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because TNF-α and IL-1β have been observed to modulate the function of the EGF receptor in human fibroblasts (32.Bird T.A. Saklatvala J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed the possibility that TNF-α and IL-1β interfered with triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion in CaCo-2 cells by activating the EGF receptor. Intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is essential for EGF receptor-mediated signaling events (33.Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the EGF receptor signaling pathway in apoB secretion, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by tyrphostin AG1478 (34.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 18 h with oleic acid and increasing concentrations of TNF-α or IL-1β in the presence or absence of tyrphostin AG1478. The amount of apoB secreted was then estimated. As shown in Fig.1 A, tyrphostin completely prevented the decrease in apoB secretion observed in cells incubated with TNF-α alone. In cells incubated with IL-1β, tyrphostin significantly attenuated the decrease in apoB secretion. Moreover, tyrphostin completely blocked the decrease in apoB secretion observed in cells incubated with EGF, a ligand of the EGF receptor which activates receptor tyrosine kinase. Tyrphostin itself had no effect on the secretion of apoB. These results suggest that the cytokines decreased apoB secretion by activating the EGF receptor signaling pathway. This was addressed further by incubating cells for 18 h with 100 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 ng/ml IL-1β, or both. In addition, some cells were also incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF alone or together with either TNF-α or IL-1β. This concentration of EGF causes saturation of cell surface binding (see Fig. 3 A) and likely maximal stimulation of the EGF receptor signaling pathway. At the end of the incubation, the amount of apoB secreted was estimated. The results are shown in Fig. 1 B. ApoB secretion by cells incubated with EGF was decreased dramatically and was 2-fold less than the amount secreted by cells incubated with either cytokine alone. When cells were incubated with both cytokines together, the decrease in apoB secretion was additive and was similar to the inhibition induced by EGF alone. It is likely, therefore, that together TNF-α and IL-1β act additively to activate the EGF receptor signaling pathway leading to an inhibition in apoB secretion. Moreover, compared with the effects of EGF alone, addition of either TNF-α or IL-1β to cells incubated with EGF did not decrease the secretion of apoB further, suggesting that the cytokines were acting through the same pathway as EGF in inhibiting apoB secretion.Figure 3Effect of TNF -α or IL-1β on cell surface binding of EGF.Panel A, cells were incubated for 30 min with either 100 ng/ml TNF-α (▪) or 10 ng/ml IL-1β (▴). The cytokines were added to the lower wells in HBSS containing 0.1% BSA. Control cells (○) received medium containing BSA alone. 250 μm oleic acid complexed to 62.5 μm BSA was added to the upper wells. At the end of the incubation, cells were washed thoroughly with ice-cold M199, and the basolateral medium was replaced with M199 containing 0.1% BSA and increasing concentrations of 125I-EGF (0.1–1000 ng/ml, 0.0003 μCi/ng EGF). M199 was added to the upper wells. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed thoroughly to remove unbound labeled EGF, lysed, and counted by gamma counting to estimate cell-associated labeled EGF. Nonspecific binding of labeled EGF to cell surfaces was estimated by incubating cells with 5 μg/ml cold EGF in the presence of 50 ng/ml labeled EGF. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of bound EGF detected/mg of protein.Panel B, Scatchard plot analysis of the results presented inpanel A. Symbols are the same as in panel A.
