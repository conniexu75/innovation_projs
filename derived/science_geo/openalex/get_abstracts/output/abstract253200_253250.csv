https://openalex.org/W1984817386,"Synchrotron X-ray radiation, produced by electron accelerators at central facilities, can now be produced in extremely narrow coherent beams. When these X-rays illuminate a crystal of nanometre dimensions a diffraction pattern emerges that is highly resolved. This provides a powerful new tool for structural analysis, as the fine features of the diffraction pattern can be interpreted in terms of sub-atomic distortions within the crystal attributable to its contact with an external support. Coherent X-ray diffraction patterns derived from third-generation synchrotron radiation sources can lead to quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale. Coherent X-ray diffraction imaging is a rapidly advancing form of microscopy: diffraction patterns, measured using the latest third-generation synchrotron radiation sources, can be inverted to obtain full three-dimensional images of the interior density within nanocrystals1,2,3. Diffraction from an ideal crystal lattice results in an identical copy of this continuous diffraction pattern at every Bragg peak. This symmetry is broken by the presence of strain fields, which arise from the epitaxial contact forces that are inevitable whenever nanocrystals are prepared on a substrate4. When strain is present, the diffraction copies at different Bragg peaks are no longer identical and contain additional information, appearing as broken local inversion symmetry about each Bragg point. Here we show that one such pattern can nevertheless be inverted to obtain a ‘complex’ crystal density, whose phase encodes a projection of the lattice deformation. A lead nanocrystal was crystallized in ultrahigh vacuum from a droplet on a silica substrate and equilibrated close to its melting point. A three-dimensional image of the density, obtained by inversion of the coherent X-ray diffraction, shows the expected facetted morphology, but in addition reveals a real-space phase that is consistent with the three-dimensional evolution of a deformation field arising from interfacial contact forces. Quantitative three-dimensional imaging of lattice strain on the nanometre scale will have profound consequences for our fundamental understanding of grain interactions and defects in crystalline materials4. Our method of measuring and inverting diffraction patterns from nanocrystals represents a vital step towards the ultimate goal of atomic resolution single-molecule imaging that is a prominent justification for development of X-ray free-electron lasers5,6,7."

https://openalex.org/W2029349036,"Water freezes into ice, atomic spins spontaneously align in a magnet, liquid helium becomes superfluid: Phase transitions are dramatic phenomena. However, despite the drastic change in the system's behaviour, observing the transition can sometimes be subtle. The hallmark of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and superfluidity in trapped, weakly interacting Bose gases is the sudden appearance of a dense central core inside a thermal cloud. In strongly interacting gases, such as the recently observed fermionic superfluids, this clear separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud is no longer given. Condensates of fermion pairs could be detected only using magnetic field sweeps into the weakly interacting regime. The quantitative description of these sweeps presents a major theoretical challenge. Here we demonstrate that the superfluid phase transition can be directly observed by sudden changes in the shape of the clouds, in complete analogy to the case of weakly interacting Bose gases. By preparing unequal mixtures of the two spin components involved in the pairing, we greatly enhance the contrast between the superfluid core and the normal component. Furthermore, the non-interacting wings of excess atoms serve as a direct and reliable thermometer. Even in the normal state, strong interactions significantly deform the density profile of the majority spin component. We show that it is these interactions which drive the normal-to-superfluid transition at the critical population imbalance of 70(5)%."

To evaluate this treatment in primates, 12 monkeys were subjected to cervical lesion. Recovery of manual dexterity and sprouting of corticospinal axons were enhanced in monkeys treated with Nogo-A-specific antibody as compared to monkeys treated with control antibody."

Here, we show that intravascular administration of recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors carrying a microdystrophin gene restores expression of dystrophin in the respiratory, cardiac and limb musculature of these mice, considerably reducing skeletal muscle pathology and extending lifespan. These findings suggest rAAV vector-mediated systemic gene transfer may be useful for treatment of serious neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2104784252,"Febrile seizures are frequent during early childhood, and prolonged (complex) febrile seizures are associated with an increased susceptibility to temporal lobe epilepsy. The pathophysiological consequences of febrile seizures have been extensively studied in rat pups exposed to hyperthermia. The mechanisms that trigger these seizures are unknown, however. A rise in brain pH is known to enhance neuronal excitability. Here we show that hyperthermia causes respiratory alkalosis in the immature brain, with a threshold of 0.2-0.3 pH units for seizure induction. Suppressing alkalosis with 5% ambient CO2 abolished seizures within 20 s. CO2 also prevented two long-term effects of hyperthermic seizures in the hippocampus: the upregulation of the I(h) current and the upregulation of CB1 receptor expression. The effects of hyperthermia were closely mimicked by intraperitoneal injection of bicarbonate. Our work indicates a mechanism for triggering hyperthermic seizures and suggests new strategies in the research and therapy of fever-related epileptic syndromes."

Here we report that visual deprivation produces opposite changes in synaptic function in primary visual and somatosensory cortices in rats, which are rapidly reversed by visual experience. This type of bidirectional cross-modal plasticity is associated with changes in synaptic AMPA receptor subunit composition."

https://openalex.org/W1965847019,"Bright objects capture our attention by virtue of 'popping out' from their surroundings. This correlates with strong responses in cortical areas thought to be important in attentional allocation. Previous studies have suggested that with the right mindset or training, humans can ignore popout stimuli. We studied the activity of neurons in monkey lateral intraparietal area while monkeys performed a visual search task. The monkeys were free to move their eyes, and a distractor, but never the search target, popped out. On trials in which the monkeys made a saccade directly to the search target, the popout distractor evoked a smaller response than the non-popout distractors. The intensity of the response to the popout correlated inversely with the monkeys' ability to ignore it. We suggest that this modulation corresponds to a top-down mechanism that the brain uses to adjust the parietal representation of salience."

https://openalex.org/W2016230599,"The discovery of the resonance in electron-doped superconducting Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4-δd (Tc = 24 K) demonstrates that the resonance is a fundamental property of the superconducting copper oxides and therefore must play an essential role in the mechanism of superconductivity. In conventional superconductors, the interaction that pairs the electrons to form the superconducting state is mediated by lattice vibrations1 (phonons). In high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxides, it is generally believed that magnetic excitations might play a fundamental role in the superconducting mechanism because superconductivity occurs when mobile ‘electrons’ or ‘holes’ are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds2. Indeed, a sharp magnetic excitation termed ‘resonance’ has been observed by neutron scattering in a number of hole-doped materials3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. The resonance is intimately related to superconductivity12, and its interaction with charged quasi-particles observed by photoemission13,14, optical conductivity15, and tunnelling16 suggests that it might play a part similar to that of phonons in conventional superconductors. The relevance of the resonance to high-Tc superconductivity, however, has been in doubt because so far it has been found only in hole-doped materials17. Here we report the discovery of the resonance in electron-doped superconducting Pr0.88LaCe0.12CuO4-δ (Tc = 24 K). We find that the resonance energy (Er) is proportional to Tc via Er ≈ 5.8kBTc for all high-Tc superconductors irrespective of electron- or hole-doping. Our results demonstrate that the resonance is a fundamental property of the superconducting copper oxides and therefore must be essential in the mechanism of superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W2032555893,"Calcium-dependent facilitation of L-type calcium channels has been reported to depend on the function of calmodulin kinase II. In contrast, the mechanism for voltage-dependent facilitation is not clear. In HEK 293 cells expressing Cav1.2, Cavβ2a, and calmodulin kinase II, the calcium current measured at +30 mV was facilitated up to 1.5-fold by a 200-ms-long prepulse to +160 mV. This voltage-dependent facilitation was prevented by the calmodulin kinase II inhibitors KN93 and the autocamtide-2-related peptide. In cells expressing the Cav1.2 mutation I1649E, a residue critical for the binding of Ca2+-bound calmodulin, facilitation was also abolished. Calmodulin kinase II was coimmunoprecipitated with the Cav1.2 channel from murine heart and HEK 293 cells expressing Cav1.2 and calmodulinkinase II. The precipitated Cav1.2 channel was phosphorylated in the presence of calmodulin and Ca2+. Fifteen putative calmodulin kinase II phosphorylation sites were identified mostly in the carboxyl-terminal tail of Cav1.2. Neither truncation at amino acid 1728 nor changing the II-III loop serines 808 and 888 to alanines affected facilitation of the calcium current. In contrast, facilitation was decreased by the single mutations S1512A and S1570A and abolished by the double mutation S1512A/S1570A. These serines flank the carboxyl-terminal EF-hand motif. Immunoprecipitation of calmodulin kinase II with the Cav1.2 channel was not affected by the mutation S1512A/S1570A. The phosphorylation of the Cav1.2 protein was strongly decreased in the S1512A/S1570A double mutant. These results suggest that voltage-dependent facilitation of the Cav1.2 channel depends on the phosphorylation of Ser1512/Ser1570 by calmodulin kinase II.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). In the heart, the size of the intracellular Ca2+ transient is determined by the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and by the size of the L-type current (2Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3295) Google Scholar). The availability of L-type channels to open is regulated by the membrane potential and other factors that include protein kinases, phosphatases, and Ca2+-binding proteins (3Catterall W.A. Striessnig J. Snutch T.P. Perez-Reyes E. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 4Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Physiol. 1981; 310: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or a strong depolarizing prepulse (6Noble S. Shimoni Y. J. Physiol. 1981; 310: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) drives the L-type calcium channels from their normal gating pattern into a mode of gating characterized by long opening and high open probability (7Pietrobon D. Hess P. Nature. 1990; 346: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Kleppisch T. Pedersen K. Strubing C. Bosse-Doenecke E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Hescheler J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2502-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a process that has been termed “facilitation.” The structural mechanism underlying facilitation is still not clear. Initially, it was suggested that facilitation required cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (9Artalejo C.R. Ariano M.A. Perlman R.L. Fox A.P. Nature. 1990; 348: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These findings were not confirmed by others (8Kleppisch T. Pedersen K. Strubing C. Bosse-Doenecke E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, it was shown that facilitation required elevated [Ca2+]inthe vicinity of the channel (“Ca2+-dependent facilitation”) (13Anderson M.E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Excessive calcium influx is toxic to cells. As a consequence, calcium channels have evolved voltage- and Ca2+-dependent inactivation mechanisms. Both Ca2+-dependent facilitation and inactivation require high affinity binding of calmodulin (CaM) to the IQ motif located in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the Cav1.2 channel (14Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 15Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol.

In contrast, the mutation of the same isoleucine to glutamate eliminated both forms of autoregulation. Several additional peptide sequences may be involved in the complex formation of CaM with the channel (17Tang W. Halling D.B. Black D.J. Pate P. Zhang J.Z. Pedersen S. Altschuld R.A. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1538-1547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanisms behind this Ca2+/CaM-dependent regulation are reviewed in Ref. 18Halling D.B. Aracena-Parks P. Hamilton S.L. Sci. STKE 2005. 2005; : RE15Google Scholar. Ca2+-dependent facilitation has been attributed to the action of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) (19McCarron J.G. McGeown J.G. Reardon S. Ikebe M. Fay F.S. Walsh Jr., J.V.

Premack B.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Constitutively active CaM-KII facilitated L-type current in excised patches (23Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). CaM-KII was reported to phosphorylate the main subunit of an isolated L-type calcium channel (24Jahn H. Nastainczyk W. Rohrkasten A. Schneider T. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation site was not identified in that study. So far, the mechanism of facilitation caused by a strong depolarizing prepulse (“voltage-dependent facilitation”) is unclear. The functional significance of CaM-KII depends on its subcellular localization (13Anderson M.E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). CaM-KII has been shown to be localized closely to the Cav1.2 channel in cardiac muscle (25Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Corbin J.D. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26O-Uchi J. Komukai K. Kusakari Y. Obata T. Hongo K. Sasaki H. Kurihara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9400-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Despite this localization, activation of the enzyme apparently required release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (27Bartel S. Vetter D. Schlegel W.P. Wallukat G. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2173-2185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Wu Y. Dzhura I. Colbran R.J. Anderson M.E. J. Physiol. 2001; 535: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), thereby allowing integration of spatially and temporally separated [Ca2+]i spikes. These and other studies showed that CaM-KII is an important regulator of neuronal and muscular function (29Soderling T.R. Chang B. Brickey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3719-3722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), because its activity reflects the frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations. The kinase might, therefore, be able to integrate variable Ca2+ signals over time. Here we show that the Cav1.2 protein immunoprecipitated in a complex with CaM-KII and was phosphorylated in a Ca2+/CaM-dependent manner. Transient expression of Cav1.2 and the cardiac Cavβ2a subunit in a cell line stably expressing CaM-KII allowed us to identify for the first time the two CaM-KII phosphorylated serines that are necessary for voltage-dependent facilitation. Interestingly, these two serines flank the EF-hand of Cav1.2. All substances used were of the highest purity available. The Cav1.2-specific antibody used in this study has been described previously (30Moosmang S. Schulla V. Welling A. Feil R. Feil S. Wegener J.W. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N.

The primers are given in Table 1. PCR amplification was performed using pcDNA3Cav1.2b, pcDNA3Tr1728, or pcDNA3Cavβ2a as template. For construction of the mutants S1512A, S1570A, S1512A/S1570A, and S1695A, the PCR products were digested with SacII/XbaI. For construction of the mutants S808A, S888A, and S808A/S888A, the PCR products were digested with SgrAI/PmII. The resulting PCR fragments were ligated into the corresponding sites of the digested vectors. The Cav1.2b subunit was truncated carboxy-terminally at amino acid 1728 (for details, see Ref. 32Seisenberger C. Welling A. Schuster A. Hofmann F. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

The GST fusion proteins of the truncated COOH terminus were cloned in the pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) vector and mutated using overlap PCR. Each construct was sequenced to verify the correctness of the sequence around the mutation and the ligation (SEQLAB, Göttingen, Germany).TABLE 1Sequences of forward and reverse primers for the design of Cav1.2 and Cavβ mutants Shaded triplets correspond to intended mutations. Underlined boldface letters correspond to mutated amino acids. Transfection of HEK 293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) stably expressing Cav1.2b and the cardiac Cavβ2a subunit were transiently transfected with the expression vector for CaM-KII (total cDNA 0.3 μg) by a lipofection method using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's guide (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells stably expressing CaM-KII were transiently transfected with the expression vectors for wild type and the various Cav1.2b chimeras and the cardiac Cavβ2a subunit (0.15 μg of each). After transfection, the cells were grown for 40-48 h before beginning the electrophysiological experiments. Electrophysiological Recordings—Whole-cell ICa was measured at room temperature. Stimulation and data acquisition were performed through EPC 9 and HEKA PULSE (version 8.54; HEKA Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). Data were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1.67 kHz. The pipette had a resistance of 2-3.5 megaohms when filled with intracellular solution. Series resistance and capacitive components were compensated by circuitry equipped in EPC 9. Extracellular solution was composed of 82 mm NaCl, 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl, 30 mm CaCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. Equimolar BaCl2 was used instead of CaCl2 in the case of barium current (IBa) measurement. Intracellular solution was composed of 102 mm CsCl, 10 mm triethanolamine-Cl, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. To measure current-voltage (I-V) relations, the cell was stimulated with 300-ms square pulses of -50 to 80 mV in increments of 10 mV from a holding potential of -80 mV. Facilitation of ICa was measured during a triple pulse protocol with a 100-ms control pulse to +30 mV (TP1) followed by a 200-ms prepulse to +160 mV followed by a 100-ms test pulse to +30 mV (TP2) (Fig. 1a). The extent of voltage-dependent facilitation was calculated as the ratio of the peak current during TP2 and TP1. The extent of inactivation was evaluated by the residual current fraction at the end of a 300-ms square pulse at +30 mV (R300). 0.5 μm KN-93 (Calbiochem) was applied in extracellular solution, or 10 μm autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (Calbiochem) was added to intracellular solution to inhibit CaM-KII. KN-92 (1 μm; Calbiochem) was used as control of KN-93. Data plotting and statistical analysis was carried out using ORIGIN software (version 6.1052; Microcal, Northampton, MA). Pooled data are given as mean ± S.E. Generation of Cell Lines—The cDNA for CaM-KIIα (AK083245) was cloned from a murine embryonal cDNA library using a PCR strategy and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The 5′-PCR primer contains an additional consensus sequence for initiation of translation (GCC ACC). HEK 293 cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser™; Bio-Rad) with the expression vectors pcDNA3Cav1.2b plus pcDNA3Cavβ2a or pcDNA3CaM-KII using linearized DNA. The HEK 293 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5-10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). After electroporation, the cells were grown for 48 h without selection medium. Thereafter, the medium was supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 to select for CaM-KII or with 400 μg/ml G418 plus 200 μg/ml hygromycin B to select for Cav1.2b plus Cavβ2a. The medium was changed every third day. Three weeks after the electroporation, individual cell clones were isolated with the aid of a cloning ring. Stable expression of the calcium channel subunits was confirmed by patch-clamp experiments; stable expression of CaM-KII was confirmed by Western blotting with a monoclonal CaM-KII antibody (MA1-048; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and a goat secondary antibody (IgG (H + L) 112-055-062; Dianova). Untransfected HEK 293 cells expressed neither L-type calcium channels nor CaM-KII. Preparation and Solubilization of Membranes and GST Fusion Proteins—All preparative steps were performed at 4 °C using precooled solutions containing the protease inhibitor mixture P8340 (2 μl/ml; Sigma), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (200 nm), calpain inhibitor I (8 μg/ml), and calpain inhibitor II (8 μg/ml). Hearts from 6-12-week-old male mice or HEK 293 cells were frozen and pulverized under liquid N2 in a porcelain mortar and then resuspended in membrane preparation buffer containing 300 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (1 ml/100 mg of tissue or 3 × 106 cells, respectively). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove larger cell fragments, including nuclei. Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation (50,000 rpm at 4 °C) for 30 min, and channels were solubilized for 20 min on ice with 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm, Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. The following buffer was used for solubilization in the presence of calcium: 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture. Nonsoluble material was removed by a second ultracentrifugation step (50,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min). GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 E. coli according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting of Cav1.2 and CaM-KII—The solubilized membranes from heart and HEK 293 cells were preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to remove proteins that bind to the resin nonspecifically. After removal of the Sepharose beads by centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated on ice with antibodies. After 2.5 h, protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose was added, samples were tilted for 1 h, and the resins were washed and extracted with 1:6 (v/v) SDS sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel. The separated proteins were immunoblotted as described in Ref. 30Moosmang S. Schulla V. Welling A. Feil R. Feil S. Wegener J.W. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6027-6034Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar. All experiments were repeated three times with comparable results. Phosphorylation with CaM-KII—For CaM-KII kinase reactions, full-length Cav1.2 was immunoprecipitated with the Cav1.2-specific antibody, and immune complexes were captured on protein A-Sepharose. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Precipitated complexes were resuspended in phosphorylation buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA). Samples were incubated with 250 units of CaM-KII (New England Biolabs) (preincubated in the presence or absence of Ca2+/CaM), and phosphorylation was initiated at 30 °C with 33 μm Mg-[γ-32P]ATP (54 μCi/μmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and terminated after 10 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel, and incorporated 32Pi was detected by autoradiography. Numerous experiments have shown that the cardiac L-type ICa can be facilitated by a strong prepulse to positive membrane potentials or by Ca2+ released from intracellular stores (for a review, see Ref. 13Anderson M.E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Initial experiments with an HEK 293 cell line stably expressing the Cav1.2 and the cardiac Cavβ2a subunits of the L-type calcium channel in the presence or absence of the α2δ subunit did not result in voltage-dependent facilitation of ICa (Fig. 1b). Similar findings have been reported by other groups (13Anderson M.E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2004; 14: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The failure to induce facilitation in HEK 293 cells was not caused by a lack of CaM, which is expressed in sufficient amounts, but was rather due to a deficiency of CaM-KII, which we were unable to detect in these cells with the antibodies used. In line with this view, facilitation was readily observed following coexpression of the Cav1.2 and the Cavβ2a subunit with CaM-KII (Fig. 1b). Moreover, superfusion of the cells with the CaM-KII inhibitor KN-93 (0.5 μm) abolished ICa facilitation (Fig. 1b), whereas it was not affected by the inactive analogue KN-92 (1 μm). The CaM-KII specificity of the reaction was substantiated further by the finding that inclusion of the CaM-KII inhibitor peptide, autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (10 μm), in the pipette solution suppressed ICa facilitation. As reported by Zühlke et al. for calcium-dependent facilitation (14Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 15Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21121-21129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), voltage-dependent facilitation was abolished by mutation of the IQ motif to EQ in the Cav1.2 subunit (Fig. 1b). The relative small current was not unexpected (see also Ref. 36Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), because mutations in this region of Cav1.2 affect trafficking of the channel (37Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The importance of an intact IQ motif for calcium-dependent inactivation of the channel has also been reported by several other groups (38Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 39Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Adelman J.P. Yue D.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The depolarizing prepulse significantly inhibited ICa through the mutated channel (Fig. 1, b and c), supporting the notion that voltage-dependent inactivation is intact in the I1649E mutant. Similar results have been reported by others (16DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 38Erickson M.G. Liang H. Mori M.X. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The lack of facilitation of the I1649E channel was not caused by an impairment of the interaction between the channel and the CaM-KII, because CaM-KII immunoprecipitated with the mutated channel (see Fig. 4d). Complex formation of CaM-KII with the channel outside of the IQ motif has been reported also by Hudmon et al. (42Hudmon A. Schulman H. Kim J. Maltez J.M. Tsien R.W. Pitt G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) during the processing of this manuscript. The results above strongly support the hypothesis that CaM-KII is activated during the prepulse and that activated CaM-KII phosphorylates either the Cav1.2 or the Cavβ2a subunit. To substantiate this hypothesis, we analyzed the sequence of both proteins for potential CaM-KII phosphorylation sites using the prediction algorithm of Refs. 43Soderling T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 44White R.R. Kwon Y.G. Taing M. Lawrence D.S. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3166-3172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar. Fifteen putative phosphorylation sites were identified in the Cav1.2 sequence (Fig. 2). Ser249, Thr713, and Thr1439 were not considered further, because it is rather unlikely that these residues are accessible from the intracellular space. The remaining sites were analyzed in a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing CaM-KII. Six of the sites were located carboxyl-terminally from amino acid 1728 (Fig. 2). Truncation of the Cav1.2 subunit at amino acid 1728 did not affect facilitation (Table 2), ruling out that these putative phosphorylation sites were involved in the facilitation process. In agreement with previous findings (12Dai S. Klugbauer N. Zong X. Seisenberger C. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Seisenberger C. Welling A.

https://openalex.org/W2047903321,"RNA interference was used to simultaneously suppress the expression of the two genes that encode the PsbQ proteins of Photosystem II (PS II) in Arabidopsis thaliana, psbQ-1 (At4g21280) and psbQ-2 (At4g05180). Two independent PsbQ-deficient plant lines were examined. These plant lines produced little detectable PsbQ protein. Under normal growth light conditions, the wild type and mutant plants were visually indistinguishable. Additionally, analysis of steady state oxygen evolution rates and chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics indicated little alteration of photosynthetic capacity in the mutant plants. No loss of other PS II proteins was evident. Interestingly, flash oxygen yield analysis performed on thylakoid membranes isolated from the mutant and wild type plants indicated that the oxygen-evolving complex was quite unstable in the mutants. Furthermore, the lifetime of the S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex appeared to be increased in these plants. Incubation of the wild type and mutant plants under low light growth conditions led to a significantly stronger observed phenotype in the mutants. The mutant plants progressively yellowed (after 2 weeks) and eventually died (after 3-4 weeks). The wild type plants exhibited only slight yellowing after 4 weeks under low light conditions. The mutant plants exhibited a large loss of a number of PS II components, including CP47 and the D2 protein, under low light conditions. Additionally, significant alterations of their fluorescence characteristics were observed, including an increased FO and decreased FV, yielding a large loss in PS II quantum efficiency (FV/FM). Analysis of QA decay kinetics in the absence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea indicated a defect in electron transfer from QA- to QB, whereas experiments performed in the presence of this herbicide indicated that the recombination rate between QA- and the S2 state was strongly retarded. These results indicate that the loss of the PsbQ protein induces significant changes in Photosystem II function, particularly in low light-grown plants, and that the PsbQ protein is required for photoautotrophic growth under low light conditions.

In higher plants and cyanobacteria, at least six intrinsic proteins appear to be required for oxygen evolution by Photosystem II (PS II) 2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: PS II, photosystem II; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; RNAi, RNA interference; DCBQ, 2,6-dichloro p-benzoquinone.2The abbreviations and trivial names used are: PS II, photosystem II; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; RNAi, RNA interference; DCBQ, 2,6-dichloro p-benzoquinone.

These are CP47, CP43, the D1 and D2 proteins, and the α and β subunits of cytochrome b559. Insertional inactivation or deletion of the genes for these components results in the complete loss of oxygen evolution activity. Additionally, a number of low molecular mass, intrinsic membrane protein components are associated with PS II (4Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Bricker T.M. Ghanotakis D. Yocum C.F. Ort D.R. Oxygenic Photosynthesis, The Light Reactions.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2821) Google Scholar); however, the functions of many of these proteins remain obscure. Although PS II complexes containing only these intrinsic components can evolve oxygen, they do so at low rates (∼25-40% of control), are extremely susceptible to photoinactivation, and require high, non-physiological levels of calcium and chloride for maximal activity (1Murata N. Miyao M. Omata T. Matsunami H. Kuwabara T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 363-369Crossref Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Bricker T.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4623-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).In higher plants, three extrinsic proteins, with apparent molecular masses of 33, 24, and 17 kDa, are required for high rates of oxygen evolution at physiological inorganic cofactor concentrations (for review, see Ref. 7Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T. Satoh K. Photosystem II, The Water/Plastoquinone Oxido-Reductase of Photosynthesis. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005: 95-120Google Scholar). The 33-kDa component, PsbO protein, is required for stabilization of the manganese cluster during exposure to low chloride concentrations or to exogenous reductants. The 24- and the 17-kDa proteins (termed the PsbP and PsbQ proteins, respectively) appear to modulate the calcium and chloride requirements for efficient oxygen evolution. These three extrinsic components interact with intrinsic membrane proteins and possibly with each other to yield fully functional oxygen-evolving complexes. It is unclear, however, whether the PsbP and PsbQ proteins act in concert in modulating the cofactor requirement or whether each has individual, discrete functions within the photosystem. Miyao and Murata (8Miyao M. Murata N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 303-308Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the PsbQ protein enhances oxygen evolution at chloride concentrations of <3 mm. Additionally, they show that the PsbQ protein, in concert with the PsbP component, slow the inactivation of oxygen evolution during chloride depletion and the activation of oxygen evolution during chloride reconstitution. As these authors point out, however, these experiments were performed under non-physiological conditions. It had been demonstrated earlier that the thylakoid membrane is highly permeable to chloride (9Schuldiner S. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and that the stromal chloride concentration is 30-60 mm (10Demmig B. Gilmmler H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 169-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is unclear what role the PsbQ component plays under physiological conditions. It should be noted that homologues of the PsbP and PsbQ proteins also exist in cyanobacteria. Deletion of these components in the cyanobacterial system leads to significant alterations in PS II activity (11Thornton L.E. Ohkawa H. Roose J.L. Kashino Y. Keren N. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2164-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis contains two expressed PsbQ proteins (12Peltier J.-B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F.

The mature proteins are highly conserved among all higher plant species (7Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Wydrzynski T. Satoh K. Photosystem II, The Water/Plastoquinone Oxido-Reductase of Photosynthesis. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005: 95-120Google Scholar).RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-transcriptional gene-silencing process in which double-stranded RNA induces the degradation of homologous mRNA sequences (14Hailton A.J. Baulcombe D.C. Science. 1999; 286: 950-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). RNAi has been successfully applied as a powerful gene-silencing tool in a variety of organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and in mouse oocytes. It has also become a popular research methodology for investigating the physiological functions of target genes in plants (15Waterhouse P.M. Helliwell C.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). With respect to PS II proteins, RNAi has been used to investigate the in vivo function of the PsbO proteins in Arabidopsis (16Yi X.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The studies performed in tobacco indicate that RNAi suppression of the PsbQ protein leads to no observable phenotype (17Ifuku K. Yamamoto J. Ono T.-A. Ishihara S. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In this study, we have reported the use of RNAi technology to simultaneously suppress the expression of both psbQ genes in Arabidopsis. Our results indicate that the PsbQ protein is required for the stabilization of oxygen-evolving PS II complexes under normal illumination conditions and for PS II function/stability and photoautotrophic growth under low light conditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSRNA Interference Construct and Transformation—The pHANNIBAL vector (18Wesley S.V.

Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the psbQ-1 and the psbQ-2 genes allowed the identification of one region of relatively high nucleotide identity (+183 to +563 in psbQ-1), which was chosen to silence both the psbQ-1 and psbQ-2 genes simultaneously. This construct will be referred to as psbQ-RNAi. The primers for RNAi-Q were 5′-GCGATCGATGCTGGTTTAGCTGGTGGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCGGTATCGAAGAGCTTGGT-3′ for the sense fragment and 5′-GCGGGTACCTGGTTTAGCTGGTGGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGCTCGAGGTATCGAAGAGCTTGT-3′ for the antisense fragment of psbQ-1.PCR was performed on a Rapidcycler (Idaho Technology, Inc.) in thin-walled microcentrifuge tubes in 50-μl reactions containing 5 μl of 10× PCR reaction buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP mixture, 3 μl of 10 pm/μl primer mixture, 0.25 μl of 5 units/μl Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 25 ng of Arabidopsis genomic DNA in purified water. Cycling parameters were a predenaturation step at 96 °C for 2 min followed by 30 amplification cycles (denatured at 95 °C for 20 s, annealed at 53 °C for 20 s, and extended at 72 °C for 40 s) and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified sequence was cloned into both forward and reverse orientations flanking the Pdk intron of the pHANNIBAL vector (18Wesley S.V. Helliwell C.A. Smith N.A. Wang M.-B. Rouse D.T. Liu Q. Gooding P.S. Singh S.P. Abbott D. Sytoutjesdijk P.A. Robinson S.P. Gleave A.P. Green A.G. Waterhouse P.M. Plant J. 2001; 27: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). After construction and verification by sequencing, the expression region was excised from pHANNIBAL with NotI and then subcloned into pART27 for transformation of the Agrobacterium strain GV3101 by the freeze-thaw method (19Holsters M. de Waele D. Messens E. Van Montagu M. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1978; 163: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Four-week-old Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) were transformed by the floral dip method as described previously (20Clough S.J. Bent A. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Harvested seeds were surface-sterilized with 50% ethanol and 0.5% Tween 20 for 3 min, washed briefly with 95% ethanol, and then soaked in 70% ethanol for 3 min followed by washing three times with sterile water. The seeds were spread on solid Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.7% agar, 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin and then incubated for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark. Germination and the first 10 days of growth occurred under lighted conditions at 28 °C in Petri dishes, and then the plants were transplanted to culture boxes containing solid Murashige and Skoog medium with 2% sucrose, 50 mg/liter kanamycin, and 400 mg/liter carbenicillin. To test for photoautotrophic growth, the plants were transplanted onto medium from which the sucrose was omitted and then transplanted onto soil to obtain seeds. The plants were grown under continuous light at an intensity of 25-40-μmol photons/m2/s.Screening—The presence of the RNAi construct in the kanamycin-resistant plant lines was confirmed by PCR with primers designed to amplify the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and target gene region of the introduced DNA. All of the plants that exhibited the kanamycin-resistant phenotype also exhibited the presence of the 1-kbp cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and its conjugated gene region, which was absent in the wild type plants (data not shown). Individual kanamycin-resistant plants were screened for the presence of the PsbQ protein by Western blotting. One leaf was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and ground to a powder in the presence of liquid nitrogen. After evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, a protein isolation buffer (20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4, 10 mm EDTA, 450 mm sorbitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was added followed by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE solubilization buffer, and the samples were incubated on ice for at least 15 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min before running on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting and antibody probing were performed as previously described (16Yi X. McChargue M. Laborde S.M. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16170-16174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) followed by visualization with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Super-Signal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). X-ray film was exposed by the blot and developed photographically. The monoclonal antibody FCC4 directed against the mature spinach PsbQ protein (21Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. Batcheffsky M. Current Research in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1990: 639-642Crossref Google Scholar) was found to cross-react with both the PsbQ-1 and the PsbQ-2 proteins from Arabidopsis and was used in these studies.To characterize the RNAi-Q plants in which expression of the PsbQ protein was much lower than in the non-transgenic plants, second generation plants were grown under continuous illumination at a light intensity of 25-40-μmol photons/m2/sec, and a subset of these plants was transferred to low light growth conditions (4-5-μmol photons/m2/s) for varying lengths of time.Immunological Characterization of Thylakoid Proteins—For a more in-depth analysis of the protein complement of the thylakoid membranes, chloroplasts were isolated from wild type and two mutant plant lines that expressed low levels of the PsbQ protein. These lines were designated RNAi-Q7 and RNAi-Q30, and these plant lines are collectively referred to as PsbQ-deficient plants. Leaves were ground in a glass homogenizer with a chloroplast isolation buffer (300 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 8.0, and 10 mm NaHCO3), the homogenate was then passed through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochemcal Co.), and the chloroplasts pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min. The chloroplasts were then resuspended in a small amount of isolation buffer, and the chlorophyll concentration was determined by the method of Arnon (22Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lithium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE was performed on a 12.5-20% gradient gel with 3 μg of chlorophyll loaded/lane. Western blotting, blocking, probing with antibodies, and x-ray film exposure were as described above. After development, the x-ray films were scanned with a UMax PowerLook III scanner at 300 dots/inch resolution and an 8-bit color depth.Fluorescence Measurements on Leaves—The fluorescence characteristics of wild type and PsbQ-deficient plants were examined on either a Walz 101/103 pulsed amplitude fluorometer or a Photon Systems Instruments FL3000 dual modulation kinetic fluorometer. It should be noted that, for these and other functional studies, the data from the RNAi-Q7 and RNAi-Q30 plants were combined. Essentially no functional differences were observed between these two mutant plant lines. Single leaves were excised from the plants and dark-incubated for 5 min before illumination with the weak measuring beam. In some experiments, the leaves were treated with 40 μm DCMU and 0.1% Tween 20 in water for 30 min prior to performing the fluorescence experiments. QA- reoxidation was measured after a single saturating flash, either in the absence or presence of 40 μm DCMU. Single leaves were excised from the plants and dark-incubated for 5 min before illumination with a 4-μs saturating flash. Data were analyzed using Origin 6.1 software.Steady State and Flash Oxygen Yield Analysis—Oxygen evolution studies were performed on thylakoid membrane fragments isolated from wild type and PsbQ-deficient plants. Thylakoid fragments were isolated by grinding 2-5 leaves in a glass homogenizer with 1 ml of a buffer containing 0.45 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 20 mm tricine-NaOH, pH 8.4. The homogenate was filtered through 1 layer of Miracloth, and the thylakoid fragments were pelletted by centrifugation at 4 °C at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. Steady state measurements were performed in a Hansatech oxygen polarograph. The chlorophyll concentration for these experiments was between 4 and 13 μg of chlorophyll/ml assayed in 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.6, with 200 μm DCBQ added as an electron acceptor. The light intensity for these experiments was 2000-μmol photons/m2/s.Flash oxygen yield measurements were performed on a bare platinum electrode (Artesian Scientific Co., Urbana IL). Flashes were supplied by an integrated, computer-controlled Xenon flash lamp (20 μs at one-half height). For the measurements of S-state distributions and S-state parameters, thylakoid fragments were pelleted and applied to the electrode as a thin paste. The thylakoids were then incubated for 5 min in the dark, the electrode was polarized at 0.73 V for 10 s, and a series of saturating flashes was applied. Data points were collected at 500-μs intervals during the duration of the flash train. The data were analyzed using a four-step, homogeneous model (23Meunier P.C. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 36: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Five- and six-state models that incorporated either an S-1 state or S-1 and S-2 states, respectively, uniformly failed to fit the data acquired either from the wild type or mutant thylakoids. For experiments that examined the stability of the oxygen-evolving complex, the thylakoid fragments were applied to the electrode as described above and incubated on the electrode (in the absence of polarizing voltage) at room temperature (24 °C) for various lengths of time prior to initiation of the flash yield experiment, either in the dark or under low light conditions (5-μmol photons/m2/sec).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSeeds from wild type and from plants transformed with the RNAi-Q construct were distributed on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The presence of the RNAi-Q construct in 10 kanamycin-resistant plants was confirmed by PCR amplification of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter region. All of the plants that exhibited kanamycin resistance also exhibited the 1-kbp PCR amplification product, indicating the presence of the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter region of the RNAi construct (data not shown).To screen individual transgenic plants for the presence of the PsbQ proteins, Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both the PsbQ-1 and PsbQ-2 proteins was performed. The results from a typical screening experiment are shown in Fig. 1. In the wild type plants, two major protein bands reacted strongly with the monoclonal reagent and represent the putative PsbQ-1 and PsbQ-2 proteins. These two bands migrated with apparent molecular masses of 15.4 and 14.2 kDa, which are comparable to the masses previously observed for these proteins (13Schubert M. Petersson U.-A. Hass B.J. Funk C. Schroder W.P. Kieselbach T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8354-8365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Additionally, plants transformed with RNAi constructs designed to suppress the psbQ-1 gene lost the upper band, and plants transformed with constructs designed to suppress the psbQ-2 gene lost the lower band (data not shown). In the current study, individual transgenic plants exhibited different degrees of suppression of the expression of the two PsbQ proteins. In total, 56 plants were screened for the presence of the PsbQ proteins. The results showed that 42% of the plants had expression levels similar to wild type for the PsbQ-1 and PsbQ-2 proteins, 39% exhibited an intermediate level of expression, and ∼19% of the transgenic plants exhibited almost complete loss of the PsbQ proteins. These results are consistent with the results obtained in other RNAi studies targeting other proteins. In almost all instances, different RNAi-containing plant lines exhibit different degrees of suppression of the protein targets (16Yi X. McChargue M. Laborde S.M. Frankel L.K. Bricker T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16170-16174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Chuang C.-F. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar).Photosynthetic Competence of Plants Grown under Normal and Low Light Conditions—When grown under normal light intensities, the PsbQ-deficient plants exhibited growth rates, leaf color, and overall morphology visually indistinguishable from that of wild type. To assess the effect of the loss of the expression of PsbQ proteins on the functional competence of PS II, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics were examined in wild type and transgenic plant leaves. Under normal light growth conditions, fluorescence analysis indicated that the PsbQ-deficient plants were very similar to wild type. Few differences were observed during the initial fluorescence rise following a single saturating flash (Fig. 2A), during a fluorescence induction experiment (Fig. 2C and Table 1), or in the fluorescence decay following a single saturating flash either in the absence (Fig. 3A) or presence (Fig. 3C) of 40 μm DCMU. The latter two experiments probed the efficiency of the electron transfer from QA- to QB or the charge recombination between QA- and the S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex, respectively. The results indicated that, with respect to a number of fluorescence parameters, wild type and the PsbQ-deficient plants were very similar. Additionally, steady state oxygen evolution measurements (Table 1) indicated that the wild type and PsbQ-deficient plants exhibited similar oxygen evolution capabilities. These results verify and extend the observations by Ifuku et al. (17Ifuku K. Yamamoto J. Ono T.-A. Ishihara S. Sato F. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1175-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) on transgenic RNAi-containing tobacco plants that were deficient in PsbQ. These authors concluded that, under normal conditions, the absence of the PsbQ protein yielded no observable phenotype.FIGURE 2Chlorophyll fluorescence induction of wild type and PsbQ-deficient plants grown under normal and low light conditions.

This phenotype was observed for the PsbQ-deficient plants either in the presence or absence of the selective antibiotic. Wild type plants, on the other hand, exhibited little visible color change after 2-3 weeks and only slight yellowing after 4 weeks under low light growth conditions. The visible changes observed in the PsbQ-deficient plants after 2-3 weeks under low light growth conditions were mirrored in changes in their fluorescence and oxygen evolution characteristics. In Fig. 2B, marked changes were observed in the fluorescence rise after a single saturating flash. Although the wild type plants exhibited the typical sigmoidal rise from FO to FM observed in Fig. 2A, the mutant plants exhibited a very rapid rise (<1 μs) to a near maximal fluorescence level. This rapid rise is indicative of the fluorescence emission from disconnected light-harvesting chlorophyll proteins. Large changes were also observed in the fluorescence induction experiment (Fig. 2D and Table 1). Again, although the wild type plants exhibited little alterations in the development of variable fluorescence compared with plants grown under normal light conditions, the PsbQ-deficient plants exhibited markedly increased FO and decreased FM. This result indicates that the PS II quantum yield (FV/"

Elucidating Cdc48p-mediated apoptosis in yeast is of particular interest, because Cdc48p is the highly conserved yeast orthologue of human valosin-containing protein (VCP), a pathological effector for polyglutamine disorders and myopathies.

Mutations in VCP have been associated with “inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia” (IBMPFD), a dominant human disorder (5Watts G.D. Wymer J.

A genetic screening of a Drosophila model for human polyglutamine diseases, a class of inherited neurodegenerative disorders, identified the Drosophila homologue of Cdc48p/VCP as a modulator of apoptotic cell death (7Higashiyama H. Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Inoue Y.H. Fujikake N. Matsukage A. Kakizuka A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), leading these authors to propose VCP as a pathological effector for polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying VCP-mediated cell death in these human disorders remain largely unknown.Apoptotic phenotypes in cells expressing mutated Cdc48p/VCP have originally been described in budding yeast (8Madeo F.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Notably, Cdc48p was the first apoptotic mediator found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The expression of a point-mutated CDC48 gene (cdc48S565G) leads to a characteristic apoptotic phenotype: phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and vacuolization (8Madeo F.

These results obtained in the cdc48S565G strain initiated the establishment of yeast as a model to study evolutionary conserved mechanisms of apoptotic regulation (14Ludovico P. Madeo F. Silva M.

In the present study, we therefore tested for mitochondrial impairment and contribution in Cdc48p-mediated apoptosis. We observed mitochondrial enlargement, distinct alterations in the mitochondrial proteome, release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, impairment in the ability of cdc48S565G cells to adapt to respiratory conditions, as well as mitochondrial ROS production paralleled to the emergence of caspase-like enzymatic activity. These data show mitochondrial impairment at morphological, molecular, and functional levels. These alterations are associated with apoptotic cell death indicating the activation of a mitochondrial pathway for Cdc48p-mediated apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Culture Conditions, and Assay for Respiratory Deficiency—S. cerevisiae wild-type KFY417 (CDC48) and mutant strain KFY437 (cdc48S565G) (20Madeo F. Schlauer J. Frohlich K.U. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 204: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) were used in this study. For all experiments (except ρ0/ρ+ experiments, see below) induction of apoptosis was done as follows (8Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J.

Cells were then grown in baffled flasks at 28 °C until early stationary and stationary phases, respectively, and then subjected to heat shock at 37 °C.For analysis of respiratory deficiency, glucose cultures of both wild-type and cdc48S565G strains were plated on YP plates (YP medium supplemented with 1.5% agar) containing (i) 4% glucose (YPGlc, fermentative selective medium) or (ii) 2% lactate (YPLac, respiratory selective medium). Cultures were spotted on agar plates in dilution series (from 5 × 106 cells to 5 × 101 cells in 10-fold dilution steps) clockwise on six distinct sections. After 5 days of incubation at room temperature, the sections were evaluated for growth.ρ0 strains (yeast strains lacking functional mitochondria) were generated from the respective ρ+ strains (KFY417 and KFY437) by growing cells in media containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 days. The resulting respiratory deficiency was confirmed by complete lack of growth on obligatory respiratory media (glycerol). In ρ0/ρ+ experiments, cells were grown and treated as described for KFY417 and KFY437 (see above) with the modification that pre-cultures were grown in YPGal/Glc (3% galactose/1% glucose), because the generated ρ0 strains were unable to grow in YPGal.Electron Microscopy—EM analysis of mitochondrial samples was carried out as previously described (21Zischka H.

Removal of cell wall was done with 30 units of lyticase (Sigma) and 0.6 unit of arylsulfatase (Roche Applied Science) for 90 min at 30 °C in digestion buffer (35 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.2 m sorbitol). Cells were washed in cacodylate buffer (0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 5 mm CaCl2), postfixed (0.5% osmium tetroxide, 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide), washed in distilled water, stained en bloc (1% aqueous uranyl acetate), dehydrated in ascending alcohol series, and embedded in Araldite. The preparations were sectioned at 50 nm on an ultramicrotome (Ultrotom III, LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and EM micrographs were obtained on a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) EM 10 electron microscope.Cell Fractionation—Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described in Zischka et al. (21Zischka H. Weber G. Weber P.J. Posch A. Braun R.J. Buhringer D. Schneider U. Nissum M. Meitinger T. Ueffing M. Eckerskorn C. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 906-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cytosol was obtained by ultracentrifugation (177,000 × g, 90 min, 4 °C) from the supernatant of the first mitochondrial sedimentation.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Image Analysis— 2-DE was performed according to Zischka et al. (21Zischka H. Weber G. Weber P.J. Posch A. Braun R.J. Buhringer D. Schneider U. Nissum M. Meitinger T. Ueffing M. Eckerskorn C.

Isoelectric focusing was done using immobilized pH-gradient strips (pH 3-10 non-linear) and gradient gels (8-16% T) for SDS-PAGE. Resultant protein patterns were detected by standard staining procedures, either silver (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar) for analytical purposes (150 μg of protein per gel) or “ruthenium II Tris bathophenanthroline disulfonate fluorescent dye” (24Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Luche S. van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) for preparative purposes (400 μg of protein per gel). Gels treated with the latter were further stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue for protein analysis (25Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). Image analysis of the gels was done with the ProteomWeaver™ image analysis software V.2.2 (Definiens AG, Munich, Germany). For the analysis of mitochondrial extracts data were determined by taking into account three independent experiments.Protein Identification via MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry— Proteins were subjected to a sequence-dependent protease treatment (100 ng of trypsin per gel plug, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) as described by Shevchenko et al. (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Resulting peptides were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting with the thin layer method (26Kussmann M. Roepstorff P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 405-424PubMed Google Scholar) using a MALDI-TOF Reflectron (Waters, Eschborn, Germany). Data base searches for protein identification were done in SwissProt using the ProteinLynx Globalserver 1.1 software (PLGS 1.1, Waters).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting Analysis—SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were carried out according to standard procedures. Immunoblots were incubated with anti-55 kDa cytosolic protein (kind gift of G. Blobel) and anti-cytochrome c (kind gift of F. Sherman), respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL plus (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and quantified using QuantityOne® V.4.2 software (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).Staining for Reactive Oxygen Species—ROS were detected with dihydrorhodamine 123 (Sigma) according to Madeo et al. (13Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) with 30-min staining at 30 °C. Cells were embedded in 0.5% agarose in PBS and evaluated for staining by fluorescence microscopy using a rhodamine optical filter (room temperature, 40×/0.75, Axioskop 2, AxioCam HRc, AxioVision 4, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). In ρ0/ρ+ experiments, ROS were detected with the mitochondrial membrane potential-independent stain dihydroethidium (Sigma). 5 × 106 cells were pelleted in 96-well microtiter plates (Microlon Fluorotrac 600, Greiner, Austria), washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 250 μl of 2.5 μg/ml dihydroethidium in PBS, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Relative fluorescence units were determined using a fluorescence reader (GENios Pro™, Tecan, Grödig, Austria, excitation 515 nm, emission 595 nm, room temperature). Dihydroethidium was used as the blank in PBS. Additionally, cells were evaluated for staining by fluorescence microscopy using a rhodamine optical filter.Survival Plating Assay—Survival plating assays were done as previously described (27Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 911-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the culture was counted with a CASY1 (Schärfe Systems, Reutlingen, Germany), diluted 1:10,000 in water, and 500 cells were plated on YPGlc plates (4% glucose). The number of colonies (colony forming units) was determined after incubating the plates for 2-3 days at 28 °C. For each experiment three plates per strain and condition were evaluated for growth of colonies.Tests for Apoptotic Markers—In vivo measurement of caspase-like enzymatic activity by flow cytometric analysis was done as previously described (27Madeo F. Herker E. Maldener C. Wissing S. Lachelt S. Herlan M. Fehr M. Lauber K. Sigrist S.J. Wesselborg S. Frohlich K.U. Mol.

Briefly, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in staining solution containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-VAD-FMK (CaspACE™, Promega). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, cells were washed and resuspended in PBS. Stained cells were counted using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and Cell Quest analysis software. CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK in situ marker is an FITC conjugate of the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor VAD-FMK. This structure allows delivery of the inhibitor into the cell where it binds to activated caspase, serving as an in situ marker for apoptosis. The bound marker is localized by fluorescence detection.The T4 terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to visualize DNA fragmentation, a late marker of apoptosis. Cell wall digestion and cell fixation were done as described by Madeo et al. (8Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). TUNEL reaction was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) and Chromatide Bodipy™ (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) as fluorescence-labeled dUTP. Cells were evaluated for stained nuclei by fluorescence microscopy using a FITC optical filter (room temperature, 40×/0.75, Axioskop 2, AxioCam HRc, AxioVision 4).RESULTSMitochondria in cdc48S565G Cells Are Enlarged Compared with Wild-type—To check for mitochondrial impairment in the apoptotic cdc48S565G yeast strain we performed ultrastructural analysis (EM) of yeast cells. In cdc48S565G cells we observed a significant enlargement of mitochondria compared with wild type (Fig. 1A, for quantification see Fig. 1B). In the cdc48S565G strain 10% of the cellular area was composed of mitochondria compared with 7% in the wild-type strain. Because the average number of mitochondria per cell was highly similar between the cdc48S565G and wild-type strains (1.1 for wild-type and 1.2 for cdc48S565G cells), these data hint toward a swelling of mitochondria in the cdc48S565G strain, which is a known feature in pathophysiological processes (28Bernardi P.

Therefore, we analyzed the mitochondrial proteome applying differential 2-DE analysis of wild-type and cdc48S565G strains. Additionally, we compared their total cell extracts and their cytosolic proteomes.Differential 2-DE analysis of mitochondria resulted in 32 significant protein spot variations between wild-type and cdc48S565G strains (Fig. 2A, compare gels 3 and 4, and Table 1). In contrast, only minimal differences were observed in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2A, compare gels 1 and 2), and the overall cellular proteome remained unchanged (data not shown).FIGURE 2Differential 2-DE analysis of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from wild-type and cdc48S565G cells. A, 2-DE comparison of cytosolic extracts (wild-type versus cdc48S565G, gels 1 and 2, respectively): 6 reproducible differences (arrows) out of 1600 protein spots per gel were found (Proteom Weaver™) (n = 6). Comparison of mitochondrial extracts (gels 3 and 4): 32 reproducible differences (arrows) out of 1400 protein spots per gel were found; identified proteins and results of quantification (ProteomWeaver™) are listed in Table 1 (n = 7). B, representative differences between wild-type and cdc48S565G strains in mitochondrial extracts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Identified proteins differentially found in mitochondrial extracts For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, protein spots were subjected to trypsin treatment. Resulting peptides were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting using a MALDI-TOF Reflection (Waters). Spectra were annotated applying MassLynx software (Waters). Subsequent data base searches in SwissProt were done using the ProteinLynx Globalserver 1.1 software (PLGS 1.1, Waters) with the following search parameters: organisms, unrestricted; fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications, oxidations (M); mass values, monoisotopic; protein mass, unrestricted; peptide mass tolerance, ±150 ppm; peptide charge state, 1+; maximum missed cleavages, 1. For 2-DE analysis of mitochondria, image analysis of the gels was performed by using ProteomWeaver™ image analysis software V.2.2 (Definiens). For the analysis of mitochondrial extracts data were determined by taking into account three independent experiments. In total seven two-dimensional gels for wild-type and seven two-dimensional gels for cdc48S565G were considered for quantification and statistics.Spot no.

https://openalex.org/W1977054117,"Pulmonary adenoma susceptibility 1 (Pas1) is the major mouse lung cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 6 (ref. 1). Kras2 is a common target of somatic mutation in chemically induced mouse lung tumors2,3 and is a candidate Pas1 gene4. M. spretus mice (SPRET/Ei) carry a Pas1 resistance haplotype for chemically induced lung tumors5. We demonstrate that the SPRET/Ei Pas1 allele is switched from resistance to susceptibility by fixation of the parental origin of the mutant Kras2 allele. This switch correlates with low expression of endogenous Kras2 in SPRET/Ei. We propose that the Pas1 modifier effect is due to Kras2, and that a sensitive balance between the expression levels of wild-type and mutant alleles determines lung tumor susceptibility. These data demonstrate that cancer predisposition should also be considered in the context of somatic events and could have major implications for the design of human association studies to identify cancer susceptibility genes."

PilE, the major pilin subunit protein of the type IV pilus (Tfp) colonization factor of Neisseria gonorrhoeae undergoes unique, post-translational modifications with these moieties. These phospho-form modifications have been shown to be O-linked alternately to a specific, conserved serine residue of PilE. However, the enzymes and precursors involved in their addition are unknown, and the full spectrum of PilE post-translational modifications has yet to be defined. Here, an intact protein-based mass spectrometric approach was integrated with bioinformatics and reverse genetics to address these matters. Specifically we show that a protein limited in its distribution to pathogenic Neisseria species and structurally related to enzymes implicated in phosphoethanolamine modification of lipopolysaccharide is necessary for PilE covalent modification with phosphoethanolamine and phosphocholine. These findings strongly suggest that protein phospho-form modification is mechanistically similar to processes underlying analogous modifications of prokaryotic saccharolipid glycans. We also show that PilE undergoes multisite and hierarchical phospho-form modifications and that the stoichiometries of site occupancy can be influenced by PilE primary structure and the abundance of the pilin-like protein PilV.

Together, these findings have important implications for the structure and antigenicity of PilE. Covalent post-translational modifications of surface proteins in microbial pathogens are now a well established phenomenon. By modifying structure and potentially function, such post-translational modifications are likely to play an important role in the parasite-host interaction. Moreover, post-translational modifications provide effective means to augment the information content of compact genomes, to generate diversity, and to influence antigenicity. By way of example, covalent protein modifications with N- and O-linked carbohydrate appear more and more as common features of proteins of bacterial pathogens (1Szymanski C.M. Wren B.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Studies have revealed a surprisingly high degree of conservation and relatedness in a number of these systems, and in some instances glycosylation-defective mutants have been shown to be attenuated in virulence-associated properties (2Benz I.

Type IV pili (Tfp) 4The abbreviations used are: Tfp, type IV pilus; PE, phosphoethanolamine; PC, phosphocholine; DATDH, Gal(β1–4)Gal(α1–3)2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-tri-deoxyhexose; Q-Tof, quadrupole time-of-flight; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; MS3, MS/MS/MS or multiple stage MS; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography. are proteinaceous polymeric filaments that serve critical roles in disease pathogenesis and prokaryotic cell biology in many Gram-negative species. Important human pathogens expressing Tfp include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli (8Craig L. Pique M.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Tfp contribute to colonization by virtue of promoting binding to epithelial cells, motility-generating capacity, and the ability to aggregate organisms into multicellular infectious units. Tfp are also implicated in horizontal gene transfer by acting as phage receptors and being involved in many instances in competence for natural genetic transformation processes. Full comprehension of the functional relationships underlying these processes can only be achieved in the context of a thorough understanding of the structures and chemistry of Tfp, their subunit proteins, and associated molecules. For N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis Tfp, such concerns are complicated by the extensive antigenic variability of the PilE pilin subunit that arises due to gene conversion-like events between a single expression locus and multiple, variable partial gene copies (9Zhang Q.Y. DeRyckere D. Lauer P. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5366-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The high degree of PilE antigenic variation likely contributes to both the failure of gonococcal infection to engender protective immunity (10Schmidt K.A. Schneider H. Lindstrom J.A. Boslego J.W. Warren R.A. Van de Verg L. Deal C.D. McClain J.B. Griffiss J.M. Sex. Transm. Dis. 2001; 28: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the lack of efficacy associated with N. gonorrhoeae Tfp-based vaccines (11Boslego J.W. Tramont E.C. Chung R.C. McChesney D.G. Ciak J. Sadoff J.C. Piziak M.V. Brown J.D. Brinton Jr., C.C. Wood S.W. Bryan J.R. Vaccine. 1991; 9: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications also provide potential sources for PilE structural and functional diversification. The PilE subunit of the N. gonorrhoeae Tfp colonization factor undergoes differential post-translational modifications with phosphoethanolamine (PE) and phosphocholine (PC) at serine 68 (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W. Panico M. Leong W.Y. Bull V. Virji M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10798-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This finding is remarkable because these moieties had not previously been observed to be directly O-linked to polypeptide. The presence of PC on pilin was particularly compelling because this moiety is a surface constituent of many microbial pathogens, although in all the other systems it is linked through a carbohydrate moiety. The PC moiety in other bacterial pathogens has been shown to promote epithelial and endothelial cell adherence through binding to the platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor (13Cundell D.R.

In the case of parasitic nematodes, down-modulation of the immune response is attributed to PC-containing glycoproteins (18Deehan M.R. Frame M.J. Parkhouse R.M. Seatter S.D. Reid S.D. Harnett M.M. Harnett W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2692-2699PubMed Google Scholar, 19Harnett M.M. Deehan M.R. Williams D.M. Harnett W. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1998; 20: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of N. gonorrhoeae, the documentation of PC provided a structural basis for the ability of N. gonorrhoeae pilins to react with the TEPC-15 monoclonal antibody recognizing a PC epitope (20Weiser J.N. Goldberg J.B. Pan N. Wilson L. Virji M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4263-4267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A serine-linked phosphoglycerol has also been documented as being localized at residue 93 on N. meningitidis pilin (21Stimson E. Virji M. Barker S. Panico M. Blench I. Saunders J. Payne G. Moxon E.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this work we use the general term phospho-forms to encompass PE and PC pilin modifications. N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis PilE have also been shown to be glycosylated with N. gonorrhoeae strain N400 subunits bearing a disaccharide composed of a hexose residue linked to a proximal 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose sugar (HexDATDH) at Ser63 (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W. Panico M. Leong W.Y. Bull V. Virji M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10798-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and N. meningitidis strain C311 pilin bearing the trisaccharide Gal(β1–4)Gal(α1–3)2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose (DATDH) at a serine or threonine between residues 50 and 73 (22Stimson E. Virji M. Makepeace K. Dell A. Morris H.R. Payne G. Saunders J.R. Jennings M.P. Barker S. Panico M. Blench I. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). N. gonorrhoeae PilE glycosylation requires at least three gene products highly related to those implicated in the biosynthesis of the proximal bacillosamine component of N-linked glycans in Campylobacter jejuni glycoproteins (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W. Panico M. Leong W.Y. Bull V. Virji M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10798-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The mass data for N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis pilin DATDH are consistent with bacillosamine, although its stereochemistry has not been resolved. An important aspect of PilE phospho-form modifications relates to the enzymatic pathways responsible, and given their novelty, there are no direct precedents for a biosynthetic pathway. In addition, the lic gene family members implicated in PC decoration of LPS and glycoconjugates in other species are absent in both the N. gonorrhoeae or N. meningitidis genomes (23Serino L. Virji M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1550-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together with the previous demonstration that phosphoglycerol is a substituent of N. meningitidis pilin, it is noteworthy that all three substituents can be found as the polar head group of eubacterial phospholipids. It is also known that in E. coli, the inner core of LPS is decorated with PE derived from phosphatidylethanolamine in a reaction requiring EptB (24Reynolds C.M. Kalb S.R. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21202-21211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that the genomes of most Gram-negative species contain multiple genes whose products are structurally related to EptB. Such gene products directly implicated in PE modification of LPS include Salmonella enterica CptA (25Tamayo R. Choudhury B. Septer A. Merighi M. Carlson R. Gunn J.S. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3391-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and PmrC (26Lee H. Hsu F.F. Turk J. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4124-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) as well as N. meningitidis LptA (27Cox A.D. Wright J.C. Li J. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3270-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Lpt3 (28Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M. Makepeace K. Coull P.A. Wright J.C. Chalmers R. Hood D.W.

Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6970-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because high frequency frame shifting events within dca (an additional N. meningitidis gene encoding an EptB homologue (30Snyder L.A. Saunders N.J. Shafer W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) was correlated with phase (on-off) variation of the PilE PC epitope, it was renamed pptA as pilin phosphorylcholine transferase A (31Warren M.J. Jennings M.P. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 6892-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The structural basis for the PC epitope on N. meningitidis pilin remains unknown, although we presume it likely to be the same as described in N. gonorrhoeae pilin. Whatever the case, it remains unclear as to whether the mechanisms for PC and PE modification in N. gonorrhoeae are related to one another. The structural data for all PilE covalent modifications have been generated by a bottom up approach in which proteolytically derived peptides were examined by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem MS (MS/MS). Although MS and MS/MS of tryptic peptides are powerful tools for identifying post-translational modifications, they do have limitations. For example, some peptides and post-translational modifications may escape detection due to intrinsic properties relating to ionization efficiency or low stoichiometric abundance, and certain post-translational modifications may exhibit selective instability during digestion and sample preparation (at the level of small peptides). Quantitation using these techniques can also be problematic. As such, the stoichiometries of various modified forms of PilE in Tfp remain unknown, and the full extent of PilE post-translational modifications may have yet to be realized. The latter concern is made more plausible in light of data showing that at least one residue of PilE other than Ser68 is capable of being modified with PC, although the proportion of molecules with the second site modification(s) is low (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W. Panico M. Leong W.Y. Bull V. Virji M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10798-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Top-down MS approaches, in which post-translational modifications can be detected directly from intact proteins, have the potential to alleviate many of the concerns noted above. For example, tandem MS analysis of intact bacterial flagellin proteins has recently been used in the identification of unusual oligosaccharide structures (32Schirm M. Schoenhofen I.C. Logan S.M. Waldron K.C. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 7774-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we empirically developed both pilus/pilin preparation schemes and ESI MS methodologies such that intact PilE protein species could be analyzed. Using these technologies together with defined N. gonorrhoeae mutants, we present conclusive genetic evidence documenting an essential role for a previously characterized gene in the modification of PilE with both PE and PC. We also show data directly demonstrating multisite modification of PilE with PE and PC and address the relative stoichiometries of these modifications as well as identify other factors controlling phosphoform site occupancy. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Mutants—The bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1. E. coli and gonococcal strains were grown as described (33Freitag N.E. Seifert H.S. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). E. coli HB101 was used for plasmid propagation and cloning experiments. To introduce an alanine substitution at residue 68 of PilE, the Bsu36I-StuI fragment from the plasmid pIga::pilES68A (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W.

The S68A substitution creates a new restriction enzyme site (Fnu4HI) that was used to verify the mutation when transformed into gonococcal strains.TABLE 1N. gonorrhoeae strains used in this studyStrainParent strainRelevant genotypeReferenceVD300aVD300 is an Opa- derivative of MS11.MS11Koomey and Falkow (43Koomey J.M.

Open table in a new tab The plasmid pLS1 (dca::kan) (30Snyder L.A. Saunders N.J. Shafer W.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was introduced into the wild type strain N400 and into GV1 (pilVfs) by transformation and selection for kanamycin-resistant transformants (50 μg ml–1) to generate the dca null mutants designated GD2 (dca::kan) and GD3 (pilVfs, dca::kan). Introduction of the kan cassette (aphA-3) into these two strains was confirmed by PCR reactions using genomic DNA from representative transformants and the dca-specific primers dca_5′ (5′-GCATTGGAAAAAGCACTCTCCAC-3′) and dca_3′ (5′-CATCGCCTTCCCGAATATCG-3′). Construction of a Gonococcal Strain Carrying an Alanine Substitution at Residue 63—To generate an alanine substitution at residue 63 of PilE, a PCR reaction using the primers pilE5′ (5′-AAATTCCGACCCAATCAACACAC-3′) and S63A-3′ (5′-GGGATGCCACGCCGGCAGCAGTGTTGTTTTCCGG-3′) (the altered codon is in bold) was used to amplify the N-terminal part of pilE from the plasmid pPilE (34Wolfgang M. van Putten J.P. Hayes S.F. Dorward D. Koomey M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The Bsu36I-BglI fragment of this PCR product was cloned into pPilE (34Wolfgang M. van Putten J.P. Hayes S.F. Dorward D. Koomey M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) digested with Bsu36I-BglI to give the resulting plasmid pPilES63A. Direct sequencing of PCR products derived from transformants was done using custom primers at GATC-Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany) to ensure the correct introduction of the pilES63A allele and the absence of any other alterations. Construction of a dca Null Allele—Based on DNA sequence derived from the FA1090 genome project, a 1225-bp fragment of the dca open reading frame was amplified by the primers dca_5′-EcoRI (5′-CGGAATTCTTGGAAAGCAATCCTGCCGAGG-3′) and dca_3′-BamHI (5′-GCGGGATCCTCCCCCAAAAATCATAGCCG-3′) (EcoRI and BamHI sites are underlined). The PCR product digested with EcoRI and BamHI was cloned into pUP6 (35Wolfgang M. van Putten J.P. Hayes S.F. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1345-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The HindIII fragment of plasmid pCM7 (36Close T.J. Rodriguez R.L. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 20: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene cassette, was treated with Klenow fragment to create blunt ends and then cloned into a blunted BstEII site of the dca clone in pUP6. This BstEII site encompasses the codons for residues 270–273 of Dca. The resulting plasmid, pdca::cat, was introduced into gonococcal strains by transformation and selection on Gc agar plates containing 10 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol. Introduction of the cat cassette into dca was verified by PCR reactions using genomic DNA from representative transformants and the dca specific primers dca_5′ and dca_3′. Construction of Gonococcal Strains Ectopically Expressing dca—Based on DNA sequence derived from the FA1090 genome project, the complete dca open reading frame plus 422 bp of upstream sequence was amplified by the primers dca_5′SacI (5′-ACTAGAGCTCGCATTGGAAAAAGCACTCTCCAC-3′) and dca_3′SacI (5′-ACTAGAGCTCCATCGCCTTCCCGAATATCG-3′) (SacI sites are underlined). The SacI-digested PCR product was cloned into the plasmid p2/16/1 (34Wolfgang M. van Putten J.P. Hayes S.F. Dorward D. Koomey M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) digested with SacI. The resulting derivative p2/16/1_dca was used to reintroduce dca into the iga locus of strains GD2 (dca::kan) and GD3 (pilVfs, dca::kan) by transformation and selection for the linked ermC marker (8 μgml–1), generating the strains GD4 (dca::kan, iga::dca) and GD5 (pilVfs, dca::kan, iga::dca), respectively. The ectopic localization of dca was confirmed by a PCR reaction using genomic DNA from representative transformants and the primers p2/16/1_5′ (5′-GCTAACACACACGCCATTCCAAC-3′) and p2/16/1_3′ (5′-CCTTTTCCTGAGCCGATTTCAAAG-3′), which are specific for the iga locus (data not shown). Tfp Purification, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Pilus purification was carried out as described (37Wolfgang M. Lauer P. Park H.S. Brossay L. Hebert J. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Procedures for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting have been described previously (33Freitag N.E. Seifert H.S. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PilE was detected by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates using rabbit polyclonal antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Tago, Inc.). PilE-specific sera have been described previously (38Drake S.L. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PC-decorated proteins were detected by using a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal antibody TEPC-15 (Sigma) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgA (Sigma) (12Hegge F.T. Hitchen P.G. Aas F.E. Kristiansen H. Lovold C. Egge-Jacobsen W. Panico M. Leong W.Y. Bull V. Virji M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10798-10803Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CNBr Cleavage of PilE—Isolated PilE proteins were dissolved in 70% formic acid (2 mg/ml) and subjected to CNBr cleavage by adding equal volumes of CNBr solution (50 mg in 100 μl of 70% formic acid). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, CNBr was removed and trapped in NaOH pellets by repeatedly vacuum-drying the samples. CNBr-free samples were dissolved in 5% formic acid and were subject to mass spectrometric analyses or frozen at –80 °C. In-gel PilE Digestion—Coomassie-stained protein bands corresponding to PilE were serially rehydrated and washed with 150 μl of HPLC grade water, 150 μl of acetonitrile/water 1:1 (v/v), and 100% acetonitrile at room temperature. Protein reduction was carried out by the addition of 75 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 m NH4HCO3 (60 min, 56 °C) to the dehydrated gel pieces. Then excess reduction buffer was removed, and thiol groups were alkylated by adding 50 mm iodacetamide, 0.05 m NH4HCO3 (45 min at room temperature in the dark). The gel pieces were washed again with 2 × 150 μl of acetonitrile/water 1:1 (v/v) and 100% acetonitrile at room temperature. Digestion buffer (5–10 μl) containing either 25 ng/μl trypsin (pig, modified, sequencing grade) or 125 ng/μl endoproteinase Glu-C (from Staphylococcus aureus V8, sequencing grade, both from Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05 m NH4HCO3 was added, and samples were kept on ice for 30 min to allow rehydration of the gel pieces. To limit autoproteolysis of trypsin, the remaining buffer was removed and replaced with 35–50 μl of 0.05 m NH4HCO3, and digestions were carried out overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted successively with 5% formic acid and 5% formic acid, acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) and acetonitrile. The combined supernatants were dried by SpeedVac and then re-dissolved in 5% formic acid. Samples were subjected immediately to mass spectrometric analyses or frozen at –80 °C. Sample Preparation for Intact Protein MS—Isolated PilE proteins were cleaned with a methanol/chloroform precipitation procedure, as described by Wessel and Flügge (39Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of the aqueous PilE solution at 2–3 mg/ml protein was diluted 1:3 (v/v) with methanol and mixed briefly. Both 100 μl of CHCl3 and 200 μl of water were added consecutively and were followed each time by a mixing step. Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation (4000 × g for 8 min), yielding precipitated PilE at the interface. The upper methanol/water phase was removed, and 400 μl methanol was added. After mixing, the pellet was recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 8 min). The pellet was dried for 5 min in the inverted tube before dissolving the sample in 50 μl of water, 70% formic acid, acetonitrile 3:1:3 (v/v/v). Samples were subjected immediately to mass spectrometric analyses or frozen at –80 °C. Infusion MS Analysis of Intact PilE—All data were acquired on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-Tof micro, Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with the standard Z-spray ESI source. Sample solutions were infused into the ESI source at a flow rate of 5 μl/min using a syringe pump (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Model SP 100i, Vernon Hills, IL). The source block temperature was maintained at 80 °C. Nitrogen was used as both desolvation and nebulizing gas with flow rates of 300 and 20 liters/h, respectively. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed in the electrospray positive mode with the following parameter settings (parameter names as used in the MassLynx NT software, Version 3.5): capillary voltage, 3000 V; sample cone voltage, 25 V; extraction cone voltage, 4.3 V; ion energy, 3 V; collision energy, 10 eV. Mass spectral resolution was typically 4000. The MS Survey was obtained in a mass range from 150 m/z to 1700 m/z. Mass calibration in a mass range of 100–2200 m/z was performed using the ES tune mix solution from Agilent (Palo Alto, CA). The MS spectra were analyzed using the MassLynx software (Version 3.5). For deconvolution, spectra were processed with the MaxEnt1 program of the MassLynx software.

We have utilized a glycan array consisting of ∼180 different carbohydrate structures to identify the specific sialosides recognized by the prototype (MVMp) and immunosuppressive (MVMi) strains of MVM plus three virulent mutants of MVMp, MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R. All of the MVM capsids specifically bound to three structures with a terminal sialic acid-linked α2-3 to a common Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif: Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAc (3′SiaLN-LN), Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (3′SiaLN-LN-LN), and Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)-GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc (sLex-Lex-Lex). In addition, MVMi also recognized four multisialylated glycans with terminal α2-8 linkages: Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα ((Sia)3), Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GD3), Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GT3), and Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3(GalNAcβ1-4)Galβ1-4Glc (GD2). Interestingly, the virulent MVMp-K368R mutant also recognized GT3. Analysis of the relative binding affinities using a surface plasmon resonance biospecific interaction (BIAcore) assay showed the wild-type MVMp and MVMi capsids binding with higher affinity to selected glycans compared with the virulent MVMp mutants. The reduced affinity of the virulent MVMp mutants are consistent with previous in vitro cell binding assays that had shown weaker binding to permissive cells compared with wild-type MVMp. This study identifies the sialic acid structures recognized by MVM. It also provides rationale for the tropism of MVM for malignant transformed cells that contain sLex motifs and the neurotropism of MVMi, which is likely mediated via interactions with multisialylated glycans known to be tumor cell markers. Finally, the observations further implicate a decreased binding affinity for sialic acid in the in vivo adaptation of MVMp to a virulent phenotype. Sialic acid binding is required for infectious cell surface receptor recognition by parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM). We have utilized a glycan array consisting of ∼180 different carbohydrate structures to identify the specific sialosides recognized by the prototype (MVMp) and immunosuppressive (MVMi) strains of MVM plus three virulent mutants of MVMp, MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R.

In addition, MVMi also recognized four multisialylated glycans with terminal α2-8 linkages: Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα ((Sia)3), Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GD3), Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GT3), and Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3(GalNAcβ1-4)Galβ1-4Glc (GD2). Interestingly, the virulent MVMp-K368R mutant also recognized GT3. Analysis of the relative binding affinities using a surface plasmon resonance biospecific interaction (BIAcore) assay showed the wild-type MVMp and MVMi capsids binding with higher affinity to selected glycans compared with the virulent MVMp mutants. The reduced affinity of the virulent MVMp mutants are consistent with previous in vitro cell binding assays that had shown weaker binding to permissive cells compared with wild-type MVMp. This study identifies the sialic acid structures recognized by MVM. It also provides rationale for the tropism of MVM for malignant transformed cells that contain sLex motifs and the neurotropism of MVMi, which is likely mediated via interactions with multisialylated glycans known to be tumor cell markers. Finally, the observations further implicate a decreased binding affinity for sialic acid in the in vivo adaptation of MVMp to a virulent phenotype. Attachment to a cell surface receptor is an essential first step in the life cycle of many viruses. The initial viral attachment frequently determines the tissue tropism, and subsequent interactions determine the pathogenic outcome. In many virus-host interactions, glycan chains often function as initial recognition molecules, with or without a protein component. Glycans are a major element of living systems, with >50% of all proteins being glycosylated. They are abundantly present in the outer cell surface and thus serve as convenient targets for viral attachment. The recognition of specific glycan motifs by viruses can be mediated by a specific viral surface protein component, such as the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (1Gottschalk A. Chemistry of Virus Receptors. Academic Press, New York1959: 51-61Google Scholar), or specific regions of the viral capsid itself, as is proposed for members of the single-stranded DNA Parvoviridae family (2Govindasamy L.

The initial attachment of viruses to host cells is followed by an internalization process that often involves concerted actions of many factors, such as co-receptors and/or the endocytotic machinery. Two strains of minute virus of mice (MVM), 2The abbreviations used are: MVM, minute virus of mice; MVMp, prototype strain of MVM; MVMi, immunosuppressive strain of MVM; SCID, severe combined immunodeficient; VP, viral protein; wt, wild-type; VLP, virus-like particle; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; S/N, signal-to-noise.2The abbreviations used are: MVM, minute virus of mice; MVMp, prototype strain of MVM; MVMi, immunosuppressive strain of MVM; SCID, severe combined immunodeficient; VP, viral protein; wt, wild-type; VLP, virus-like particle; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; S/N, signal-to-noise. an autonomous member of the Parvoviridae family, have served as models for studies aimed at identifying parvovirus capsid regions involved in cellular host range (tropism) and pathogenicity determination (9Ball-Goodrich L.J.

The prototype strain of MVM (MVMp) possesses a fibrotropic host cell preference, and infection is asymptomatic, whereas the immunosuppressive strain (MVMi) infects hematopoietic and lymphotropic cells and can cause a lethal infection in certain genetically inbred newborn mice and adult mice with the severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) phenotype (12Segovia J.C.

Investig. 1991; 65: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies show that pretreatment of susceptible cells with neuraminidase or proteinase K inhibits MVM infection indicating that sialic acid attachment, in the context of a glycoprotein, is an essential step in its cellular recognition and tropism (11Lopez-Bueno A.

Virol. 1989; 63: 3902-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein component of the infectious receptor is unknown. MVM has a single-stranded DNA genome of ∼5 kb packaged within capsids that are ∼260 Å in diameter. The genomic DNA encodes non-structural and structural (capsid) proteins, and the MVM capsid is composed of 60 copies (total) of overlapping capsid viral proteins (VPs), VP1, VP2, and VP3 (in DNA containing full capsids only), arranged with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry (18Agbandje-McKenna M. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Wang F. Tattersall P. Rossmann M.G. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1369-1381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The three proteins are coded from the same mRNA and generated through alternative splicing (VP1 and VP2) or post-translational cleavage (VP3) after DNA packaging (19Tattersall P. Shatkin A.J. Ward D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 375-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The major VP component in wild-type (wt) full capsids is VP3 (∼90%), with varying ratios of VP1 and VP2, whereas wt empty capsids (devoid of DNA) contain only VP1 and VP2, with the latter protein as the major component at ∼95%. The entire sequence of VP3 is contained within VP2, which is, in turn, contained within VP1, which has a unique N-terminal region of 154 amino acids (20Tattersall P. Cawte P.J. Shatkin A.J. Ward D.C. J. Virol. 1976; 20: 273-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus-like particles (VLPs) that are antigenically and structurally equivalent to wt empty capsids can be produced by baculovirus expression of VP2 in Sf9 insect cells (10Kontou M. Govindasamy L.

Virology. 2000; 267: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The MVMi and MVMp strains differ by only 14 amino acid positions (of 587) in their VP2 sequence (22Astell C.R. Gardiner E.M. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 656-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These amino acids are spread throughout the primary sequence but are clustered in the three-dimensional structure at and around the icosahedral 2-fold axes and on the shoulder of protrusions at the icosahedral 3-fold axes (10Kontou M. Govindasamy L. Nam H.J. Bryant N. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Foces-Foces C. Hernando E. Rubio M.P. McKenna R. Almendral J.M. Agbandje-McKenna M. J.

In studies to identify MVMi/MVMp tropism and pathogenicity determinants, two of the differing amino acids, 317 and 321, have been mapped as allotropic determinants (9Ball-Goodrich L.J. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3415-3423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, forward second-site mutations at amino acid positions 399, 460, 553, and 558 arising from single site-directed mutations at 317 and 321 confer fibrotropism to MVMi (18Agbandje-McKenna M.

Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. Virology. 2005; 340: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, virulent forms of MVMp naturally selected in SCID mice were isolated that contain single amino acid mutations in VP2 at positions 325 (V325M), 362 (I362S), and 368 (K368R) (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Rubio M.P. Lopez-Bueno A. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11280-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Residues 362 and 368 also differ between MVMi and MVMp, with the K→R mutation changing the MVMp residue to that found in MVMi at amino acid position 368. The virulent MVMp mutants retain the in vitro cellular tropism for fibroblasts; however, they cause a lethal infection in SCID mice (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Rubio M.P. Lopez-Bueno A. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11280-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the number of days post-infection before death is prolonged, occurring ∼20-60 days post-infection compared with ∼7-13 days post-infection for MVMi, and there is no hematopoiesis, suggesting that their mode of pathogenicity is different (24Rubio M.P. Lopez-Bueno A. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11280-11290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro cell binding assays with virulent MVMp viruses in which two of the mutant residues were re-engineered into the original wt virus, either alone (MVMp-I362S or MVMp-K368R) or in combination (MVMp-I362S/K368R), showed reduced binding to a naturally abundant receptor on fibroblast cells compared with wt MVMp (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the same study, pretreatment of the fibroblast cells with neuraminidase inhibited binding by the wt MVMp and mutant viruses (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), confirming previous reports identifying sialic acid as the carbohydrate component required for cellular recognition (17Cotmore S.F. Tattersall P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3902-3911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 362 and 368 are immediately proximal to the pocket recently identified as a sialic acid binding region (Fig. 1) at the icosahedral 2-fold axis of the wt MVMp capsid (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the altered cell binding properties of the mutants suggested that the acquired virulence phenotype was mediated through a modified interaction with a sialylated cell surface receptor and that avidity or affinity for the receptor is likely a determinant of virulence (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, our goal was to identify the specific sialic acid motifs recognized by MVMi and MVMp and three virulent MVMp mutants, MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R, using a glycan array containing ∼180 carbohydrate motifs. The sugars in the array, developed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, represent the major glycan structures found in glycoproteins and glycolipids. 3The compound library was produced by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, functionalglycomics.org.3The compound library was produced by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, functionalglycomics.org. This report represents the first use of the array to study the specific interaction between whole intact virus particles and the immobilized glycans. All of the MVM viruses recognized the same α2-3 sialylated glycans linked to a Gal-GlcNAc motif, with MVMi and the MVMp-K368R mutant showing expanded recognition to α2-8 multisialylated glycans. The specificity of the interaction(s) between the glycans was identified and the MVM viruses were confirmed by secondary analysis using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biospecific interaction (BIAcore) assay. This technique also measured the relative binding affinity of MVMi, MVMp, and the virulent MVMp mutants. Our observations point to an infectious mechanism facilitated by recognition of specific sialic acid structures on the cell surface by MVM and further implicate a mechanism involving differential receptor affinity as a determinant of in vivo parvovirus virulence. Virus Production—Baculovirus constructs expressing the VP2 of wt MVMi and MVMp and the virulent MVMp mutants (MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R) that self-assemble into VLPs were generated as previously described (11Lopez-Bueno A. Rubio M.P. Bryant N. McKenna R. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, VLPs (devoid of genome) were produced in Sf9 insect cells, released by freezing and thawing, and then purified through a series of centrifugal sedimentation and density equilibrium gradients as previously reported (21Hernando E. Llamas-Saiz A.L. Foces-Foces C. McKenna R. Portman I. Agbandje-McKenna M. Almendral J.M. Virology. 2000; 267: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the viruses were adjusted to 1-3 mg/ml for SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy to check the purity and capsid integrity. For electron microscopy experiments, 4 μl of purified virus was spotted onto a 400-mesh carbon-coated copper grid (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) for 1 min before blotting with filter paper (Whatman glycan 5). The samples were then negatively stained with 4 μl of 2% uranyl acetate for 15 s, blotted dry, and viewed on a Joel JEM-100CX II electron microscope. Glycan Array Screening of MVM Viruses—Two cores of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (a National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences initiative), cores D and H, have developed a high throughput glycan screening assay for identifying specific carbohydrate binding partners for proteins using a streptavidin/biotin glycan array. The screening system utilized for the current study contained ∼180 different glycans immobilized as biotinylated glycosides on a 384-well streptavidin-coated plate. The glycoside probes are listed on the Consortium for Functional Glycomics web site as Glycan Array Version 3 at functionalglycomics.org/static/consortium/resources/resourcecoreh5.shtml. The MVM virus samples MVMi, MVMp, MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R were screened in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin) as previously described (25Bochner B.S.

Briefly, biotinylated glycosides (26Korchagina E.Y. Pochechueva T.V. Obukhova P.S. Formanovsky A.A. Imberty A. Rieben R. Bovin N.V. Glycoconj. J. 2005; 22: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were bound to streptavidin-coated microtiter plates in replicates of n = 4. Precoated plates were washed three times with 100 μl of wash buffer (binding buffer minus bovine serum albumin) prior to incubation. A stock solution of each virus preparation (30 μg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed and incubated with a rabbit anti-MVM capsid antibody (diluted 1:5,700-15,000). The plates were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes) at 5 μg/ml. All incubations were for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed and read in 25 μl of wash buffer on a Victor-2™ 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation 485 nm/emission 535 nm. To analyze the results, all glycans were ranked according to their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio by dividing their mean relative fluorescence units (from the four replicates) by the mean background generated in the control wells lacking glycosides. This value was compared with the average S/N for all wells in the array, and the results were then ranked as high affinity (>3 times the average S/N), medium affinity (>2 times the average S/N), and low affinity (>1 times the average S/N). SPR BIAcore Assay to Measure Binding Specificity and Relative Affinity of MVM-sialylated Glycan Interactions—Secondary analysis with SPR BIAcore has been used to confirm the specificity of protein interaction with glycans bound in glycan arrays (see Ref. 25Bochner B.S. Alvarez R.A. Mehta P. Bovin N.V. Blixt O. White J.R. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4307-4312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We used a similar strategy to analyze the binding of the MVM viruses to the glycans identified in the array. Three different representative glycans, Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAc (3′SiaLN-LN, glycan 106), Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (3′SiaLN-LN-LN, glycan 194), and Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GT3, glycan 111), recognized by the MVM viruses were used for these assays. All SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C on a BIAcore 3000 (B3000) instrument. The running buffer used was 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 containing 0.005% p20. Biotinylated oligosaccharides were captured on a research grade streptavidin-coated sensor chip. The chip was pretreated with three injections of 1 m NaCl/50 mm NaOH at 5 μl/min for 1 min/injection. A 10-fmol/μl solution of each biotinylated oligosaccharide was then injected at 2 μl/min for varying lengths of time until optimal amounts of the glycan were captured on each independent surface. The selected glycans 106, 194, and 111 were studied using one streptavidin sensor chip. A control (non-binding, non-sialylated) glycan, Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc (LN-LN-LN, glycan 35), was also captured on the sensor chip. The specific binding of the MVM viruses to the test glycans were measured using the in-line reference subtraction feature of the B3000. Increasing concentrations of the MVM viruses MVMi, MVMp, MVMp-I362S, MVMp-K368R, and MVMp-I362S/K368R were injected at a flow rate of 40 μl/min over all four surfaces of the sensor chip. Bound capsids were removed by injecting a 10 mm solution of glycine at pH 2.0. Binding curves for the interaction of the MVM viruses with the three different glycans were compared by overlaying the sensorgrams obtained on each surface. To identify the specific sialic acid structures recognized by MVM and biophysically evaluate the individual role of the two virulent MVMp VP mutations I362S and K368R on receptor affinity, recombinant baculoviruses expressing the VP2 of MVMi, MVMp, and the three virulent MVMp mutants were used to produce VLPs for glycan array screening and SPR BIA-core assays. The VLP samples produced were purified to high homogeneity and observed to be intact prior to use (Fig. 2). Of the ∼40 sialylated glycans in the array, all of the MVM viruses specifically bound to only three structures with terminal α2-3-linked sialic acid, 3′SiaLN-LN, 3′SiaLN-LN-LN, and Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4(Fucα1-3)GlcNAc (sLex-Lex-Lex) (Fig. 3). However, MVMi binding was extended to four additional multisialylated glycans with α2-8 linkages, Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα ((Sia)3), Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc (GD3), GT3, and Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3(GalNAcβ1-4)Galβ1-4Glc (GD2) (Fig. 3). These four glycans comprise all of the multisialylated glycans with α2-8 linkage in the array. The GT3 glycan was also recognized by the virulent MVMp-K368R mutant that contains the MVMi amino acid type at position 368 (Fig. 3). All of these glycans were ranked as having high affinity. For the three glycans recognized by all of the MVM viruses, the glycan bound the tightest, as ranked by relative fluorescence, was 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (glycan 194), followed by sLex-Lex-Lex (glycan 195), and then 3′SiaLN-LN (glycan 106) (Fig. 3). For the additional glycans recognized by MVMi, the binding ranking order was GT3 (glycan 111) > GD2 (glycan 110) > GD3 (glycan 43) > (Sia)3 (glycan 156). The affinity of MVMi for GT3 and GD2 was comparable with its affinity for 3′SiaLN-LN-LN and sLex-Lex-Lex, and that for GD3 is ∼10% less (Fig. 3). The recognition of GT3 by the MVMp-K368R mutant was at ∼10% of its binding to 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (Fig. 3). Significantly, the MVMp, MVMp-I362, and MVMp-I362S/K368R viruses only recognized sialosides with NeuAcα2-3 linked to Gal-GlcNAc (LN), with glycan 195 containing branched fucose residues. A motif that was similar to glycan 106 but with NeuAcα2-6-linked sialic acid (glycan 109) was not recognized. This motif is also very common in glycoproteins and glycolipids. In addition, the length of the oligosaccharide linked to the terminal NeuAcα2-3 also appeared to be critical for recognition by these viruses, with a pentasaccharide being the minimal length of the glycans bound (Fig. 3). There was no specificity for the shorter NeuAcα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ (3′SiaLN, glycan 38), and the affinity for the longer chain glycan heptasaccharide glycan 194 was higher than for the pentasaccharide glycan 106 (Fig. 3). Three glycans, 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (glycan 194), 3′SiaLN-LN (glycan 106), and GT3 (glycan 111), were used in SPR BIAcore experiments to validate the results of the glycan array and to determine the relative binding affinity of the MVM viruses for these sialylated molecules. A non-sialylated glycan containing the LN motif that was not recognized by the MVM viruses, LN-LN-LN (glycan 35), was captured on the fourth surface of a sensor chip and used as a negative control. Although it is assumed that there could be 60 receptor binding sites on the T = 1 MVM capsid, the exact stoichiometry of the MVM-sialic acid interaction is not known, thus the binding data were not analyzed for quantitative kinetic information. Instead, a relative binding affinity was assessed from the data based on visual examination of the binding curves. The binding curves for MVMp with different concentrations of 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (glycan 194) and 3′SiaLN-LN (glycan 106) are shown in Fig. 4. A concentration-dependent increase in SPR response was observed consistent with specific recognition of the captured glycans. Similar concentration-dependent binding was observed for the other viruses, but only MVMi and MVMp-K368R bound GT3 (data not shown). The binding of each MVM virus to the three glycans tested (glycans 194, 106, and 111) is shown in Fig. 5, and their relative binding curves are shown in Fig. 6. Consistent with the glycan array data, all MVM viruses bound to glycan 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (glycan 194) with the highest affinity (Fig. 5). Upon visual inspection, the comparative plot for glycan 194 (Fig. 6A) showed that the affinity ranking of the viruses was in the order of MVMi = MVMp >> MVMp-K368R > MVMp-I362S = MVMp-I362S/K368R. The affinities of the virulent MVMp viruses were reduced to ∼60% of the MVMp levels. The dissociation rate for MVMp was slower compared with that of the virulent MVMp mutant viruses MVMp-I362S and MVMp-I362S/K368R. On the other hand, the virulent MVMp-K368R mutant had a dissociation rate close to that of MVMp (Fig. 6B). This property, combined with the slightly higher affinity to the glycan, would most likely result in a higher equilibrium affinity compared with the other MVMp mutants. The relative binding affinity to and dissociation from 3′SiaLN-LN (glycan 106) followed the same trend as observed for 3′SiaLN-LN-LN (glycan 194) for all of the MVM viruses (Fig. 6B). For GT3 (glycan 111), only MVMi and MVMp-K368R were shown to bind, with MVMi displaying approximately four times the affinity of the virulent mutant (Fig. 6C). Their dissociation rates were comparable (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 5Relative affinity of glycan binding by the MVM viruses. The relative binding affinity for three representative glycans recognized in the array, 3′Sial-LN-LN-LN (glycan 194), 3′Sial-LN-LN (glycan 106), and GT3 (glycan 111), were measured using a SPR BIAcore assay.

https://openalex.org/W2040941372,"Subversion of the plasminogen activation system is implicated in the virulence of group A streptococci (GAS). GAS displays receptors for the human zymogen plasminogen on the cell surface, one of which is the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM). The plasminogen binding domain of PAM is highly variable, and this variation has been linked to host selective immune pressure. Site-directed mutagenesis of full-length PAM protein from an invasive GAS isolate was undertaken to assess the contribution of residues in the a1 and a2 repeat domains to plasminogen binding function. Mutagenesis to alanine of key plasminogen binding lysine residues in the a1 and a2 repeats (Lys98 and Lys111) did not abrogate plasminogen binding by PAM nor did additional mutagenesis of Arg101 and His102 and Glu104, which have previously been implicated in plasminogen binding. Plasminogen binding was only abolished with the additional mutagenesis of Arg114 and His115 to alanine. Furthermore, mutagenesis of both arginine (Arg101 and Arg114) and histidine (His102 and His115) residues abolished interaction with plasminogen despite the presence of Lys98 and Lys111 in the binding repeats. This study shows for the first time that residues Arg101, Arg114, His102, and His115 in both the a1 and a2 repeat domains of PAM can mediate high affinity plasminogen binding. These data suggest that highly conserved arginine and histidine residues may compensate for variation elsewhere in the a1 and a2 plasminogen binding repeats, and may explain the maintenance of high affinity plasminogen binding by naturally occurring variants of PAM.

The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus, GAS) 3The abbreviations used are: GAS, group A streptococcus; PAM, plasminogen binding group A streptococcal M-like protein.3The abbreviations used are: GAS, group A streptococcus; PAM, plasminogen binding group A streptococcal M-like protein. is responsible for a wide variety of skin and mucosal infections in humans. Current estimates indicate that ∼1.78 million new cases of severe streptococcal infection occur each year (1Carapetis J.R. Steer A.C. Mulholland E.K. Weber M. Lancet. Infect. Dis. 2005; 5: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). A key feature of invasive GAS infections is the ability of the organism to migrate from cutaneous and mucosal surfaces to deep tissue sites, resulting in severe invasive disease. The binding and activation of plasminogen by GAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this organism (2Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Plasminogen is a single chain glycoprotein found in plasma and extracellular fluids at concentrations of ∼2 μm (3Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Cleavage of plasminogen at a single site (Arg560-Val561) by specific plasminogen activators results in the formation of the two-chain plasmin molecule, which contains a serine protease active site in the C-terminal region (4Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Human plasminogen can also be activated to plasmin by the GAS protein streptokinase, as part of a highly species-specific plasminogen/streptokinase activator complex (2Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Plasmin has the ability to degrade fibrin clots, connective tissue, and the extracellular matrix (3Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar, 4Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus activation of this proteolytic system by GAS may have significant pathological consequences in the host (5Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Isolated initially from M53 serotype GAS, the plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein (PAM) is a 42-kDa molecule that binds both plasmin and plasminogen directly and with high affinity (Kd ∼ 1 nm) (6Berge A. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A newly developed model of GAS infection using mice expressing a human plasminogen transgene indicates that plasminogen plays a critical role in GAS infection, with a significant increase in mortality observed in transgenic mice when compared with wild-type littermate control mice (5Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Additionally, the PAM-positive GAS isolate AP53 exhibited a 60% increase in mortality in transgenic mice when compared with wild-type littermates, and a PAM-negative isogenic mutant of this strain showed only minimal virulence in both wild-type and human plasminogen transgenic murine backgrounds (5Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that for a subset of GAS isolates, the ability of PAM to focus plasminogen at the GAS cell surface is crucial for virulence. The major plasmin(ogen)-binding site of PAM is located in the N-terminal variable region of the protein and is composed of two characteristic tandem repeats designated a1 and a2. Similar binding motifs have been identified in M-like proteins of other GAS isolates associated with skin infection (6Berge A. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Svensson M.D. Sjobring U. Bessen D.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAM has been implicated in the establishment of GAS skin infections such as impetigo, and the PAM genotype is almost exclusively associated with the chromosomal emm pattern D, which is considered a genetic marker for skin tropic GAS (7Svensson M.D. Sjobring U. Bessen D.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Svensson M.D. Sjobring U. Luo F. Bessen D.E.

Infect Dis. 1996; 173: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, in the Northern Territory of Australia, where streptococcal skin infection is endemic and high rates of invasive infection such as bacteremia have been reported (10Carapetis J.R. Walker A.M. Hibble M. Sriprakash K.S. Currie B.J. Epidemiol. Infect. 1999; 122: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), PAM-positive GAS are associated with a variety of disease states (11McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The plasminogen binding domain of PAM has been shown to be highly variable; however, this diversity does not abrogate plasminogen binding by naturally occurring PAM variants (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This finding may, in part, be due to the conservation of key amino acid residues within the plasminogen binding domain (11McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M.

Plasmin-(ogen) is known to interact with its ligands via pre-formed lysine-binding sites within the N-terminally located triple-disulfide-bonded kringle domains (4Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Kringles 1, 4, and 5 display the highest affinity for lysine-based ligands, with kringle 2 displaying the weakest affinity (13Marti D.N. Hu C.K. An S.S. von Haller P. Schaller J. Llinas M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11591-11604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PAM lacks the typical C-terminal lysine residues characteristic of many plasminogen receptors. Rather, internal lysine residues in the a1 and a2 repeat regions of PAM (Lys98 and Lys111) are thought to mediate binding to kringle 2 of plasminogen (14Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Muller-Esterl W. Sjobring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Early reports suggested that Lys98 of the a1 repeat contributed the majority of the plasminogen binding ability of PAM (14Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Muller-Esterl W. Sjobring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, studies involving a polypeptide designated VEK-30 and a recombinant kringle 2 modified to contain a high affinity lysine binding site, highlighted a potential role for internal His102, Arg101, and Glu104 residues within the a1 repeat in this interaction (15Schenone M.M. Warder S.E. Martin J.A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). VEK-30 is composed of the six residues preceding the a1 repeat, the entire a1 repeat, together with the first ten residues of the a2 repeat of PAM (17Wistedt A.C. Kotarsky H. Marti D. Ringdahl U. Castellino F.J. Schaller J. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24420-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The relative contribution to binding by residues within the a1 and a2 repeat of the full-length PAM protein to plasminogen has not been characterized. Here, we have undertaken site-directed mutagenesis studies on the PAM molecule and defined residues involved in the interaction with plasminogen. These studies highlight the important contribution of multiple arginine and histidine residues within both the a1 and a2 plasminogen binding domains and may explain the capacity of naturally occurring PAM variants to maintain high affinity plasminogen binding despite considerable variation observed in the plasminogen binding repeats. Bacterial Strains and Culture Methods—Escherichia coli TOP10 containing pGEX2T-PAMNS13 expression plasmids were grown on Luria Bertani (LB) agar plates or cultured in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as described previously (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was extracted for PCR and DNA sequence analysis using the Wizard® Plus SV DNA purification kit (Promega). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The PAM gene from streptococcal strain NS13 (PAMNS13 GenBank™ AY351851), which is identical to the prototype PAM sequence in the a1 and a2 repeat domain, had previously been cloned into the expression vector pGEX2T (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To assess the role of specific-binding site residues in the interaction of PAM with plasminogen, site-specific mutations were introduced into the PAMNS13-binding site. The wild-type construct (100 ng) was used as template DNA to create site-directed mutants with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR reactions consisted of 1× Pfu reaction buffer (Stratagene), 0.25 mm dNTPs (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 units of Pfu Ultra polymerase (Stratagene), and 125 ng of each primer, made up to a volume of 50 μl with dH2O. Oligonucleotide primers (Sigma-Aldrich) were designed as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). In general, primers consisted of sequence encoding the desired mutation, flanked on either side by fifteen nucleotides of wild-type sequence. The specific primer sequences are given in Table 1, with the introduced mutations underlined. For site-directed mutants containing more than two mutations not encoded by a single primer, alanine residues were sequentially introduced using previously mutated DNA as a template. Following an initial denaturation step (95 °C for 30 s), PCR cycling parameters consisted of 16 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min. An additional 7-min extension at 55 °C was then performed. PCR was conducted with a Cooled Palm 96 thermocycler (Corbett Research). Non-amplified template DNA was removed by incubation of reactions for 1 h at 37 °C following the addition of DpnI (10 units/50-μl reaction). E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) were transformed with 150 ng of DpnI-digested PCR product using standard procedures (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

DNA sequence analysis was performed using the primers listed in Table 1, and sequence reactions were undertaken using terminator ready reaction mix (PE Applied Biosystems). DNA sequencing gels were prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions and electrophoresed using an Applied Biosystems 3130 X genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence data were analyzed using ABI Prism™ DNA sequencing analysis software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described previously (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol.

Prior to elution from the glutathione-agarose column, the glutathione S-transferase tag was removed from the N terminus of recombinant fusion proteins by the addition of one column volume of thrombin solution (1 unit of thrombin/μl, phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0). The column was incubated for 5 h at room temperature, and the cleaved recombinant protein was eluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0). Each step of the protein purification process was monitored by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), with protein visualized using Coomassie R-250 staining. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—To examine potential variation in protein secondary structure as a result of site-directed mutagenesis, far-UV CD spectra were obtained for both wild-type and mutant recombinant PAM proteins. CD spectra were acquired using a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) at room temperature. CD spectra data were recorded from 190 to 250 nm in a 1-cm path length cell containing 1.5 ml of protein solution at a concentration of 0.04 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Recorded data represent the average of six scans, corrected for buffer baseline. Molar residue ellipticity ([θ]) was calculated using the following formula: [θ] = θ × 100 × molecular weight/concentration (mg/ml) × distance × number of amino acids (21Schmid F.X. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1989: 251-284Google Scholar). The percentage of α-helix was estimated from the ellipticity at 222 nm using the following formula: % α-helix = –(θ222 nm – 4,800)/45,400 (22Phillips Jr., G.N. Flicker P.F. Cohen C. Manjula B.N.

Plasminogen Purification and Labeling—Glu-plasminogen was purified from human plasma using lysine Sepharose-4B affinity chromatography as described previously (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M.

Purified plasminogen was biotinylated by the addition of 10% (v/v) 1 m NaHCO3 (pH 9), and a 40 m excess of biotin-X-N-hydroxy-succinimide in Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was incubated at 4 °C overnight with mixing. Free biotin was separated from biotinylated plasminogen by PD-10 gel-filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (12Sanderson-Smith M.

Plasminogen Binding Analysis—Solid-phase plasminogen binding assays were performed to assess the impact of introduced mutations on protein function essentially as previously described (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ninety-six well microtiter plates (Greiner Bioone, Germany) were coated with 150 nm recombinant protein (50 μl in 0.1 m NaHCO3) at 4 °C overnight. Following three washes with PiNT (50 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80, pH 7.5), plates were blocked with 50 μl of blocking solution (1% skim milk powder, PiNT) for 1 h at 37°C. Wells were washed as above, and 500 nm biotinylated Glu-plasminogen was diluted in a 3-fold titration across the plate with blocking buffer, in the presence or absence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled Glu-plasminogen. Plasminogen was allowed to bind to immobilized proteins for 2 h at room temperature. For competition assays, decreasing concentrations of unlabeled fluid-phase wild-type PAMNS13 (25 μm to 0.14 nm) were allowed to compete with immobilized proteins for binding to biotinylated Glu-plasminogen. Competitor was titrated 3-fold across the microtiter plate prior to the addition of biotinylated Glu-plasminogen to all wells, at a final concentration of 500 nm. The assay was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following the plasminogen incubation step, microtiter plates were washed three times, 50 μl of NeutrAvidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Progen, Australia) diluted 1:5000 with blocking solution was added to all wells, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After five washes with PiNT, the reactions were developed by the addition of 50 μl of o-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) substrate (8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 5.0, 2.2 mm o-phenylenediamine, 3% H2O2). Color development was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 10 m hydrochloric acid, and the plates were read at 490 nm using a Spectramax 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Data were normalized against the highest and lowest absorbance value for each assay, and non-linear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad® Prism (version 4.00, GraphPad software, San Diego, CA). For the calculation of equilibrium binding dissociation constants (Kd), a one- versus two-site binding analysis was conducted, and the best-fit curve was fitted to the data. For competition experiments, a one-site competition curve was fitted to the data from which the effective concentration of competitor required to inhibit binding by 50% (EC50) was calculated. Statistical Analysis—For plasminogen binding experiments, a one-way analysis of variance was initially used on all data, followed by an unpaired t test with Welsch's correction to determine if there was any significant difference in the Kd values for plasminogen binding by PAM mutants and PAMNS13. The gene encoding wild-type PAMNS13 shares 100% identity with the prototype PAM sequence in the a1 and a2 repeat domain responsible for the interaction with plasminogen (11McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To assess the role of specific binding site residues in the interaction of PAMNS13 with plasminogen, a number of site-directed mutants were constructed in which the residues of interest were replaced with alanine. The binding site sequences of the five constructed mutants are shown in Fig. 1A. The presence of introduced mutations was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Following expression in E. coli, recombinant proteins of ∼40 kDa in size were purified using glutathione-agarose and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1B). The impact of mutations in the a1 and a2 repeat domains of PAMNS13 on protein structure were analyzed using far-UV CD spectroscopy. All proteins used in this study were found to have a CD emission spectrum characteristic of α-helical coiled proteins (24Freifelder D.M. Physical Biochemistry. Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Second. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York1982Google Scholar), displaying two characteristic minima at ∼210 and 220 nm and a maximum peak at 190 nm (Fig. 2). This is similar to the CD spectra of other streptococcal M proteins, which are coiled-coil α-helical proteins (22Phillips Jr., G.N. Flicker P.F. Cohen C. Manjula B.N. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, even after mutagenesis these proteins appear to maintain an α-helical secondary structure. Additionally, for all proteins the two minima are of a similar magnitude, which is indicative of coiled-coil proteins (25Graddis T.J. Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12664-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Percent α-helicity ranged from 27% to 44% (Table 2). CD analysis of other streptococcal M proteins has found them to contain between 23% and 70% α-helix (22Phillips Jr., G.N. Flicker P.F. Cohen C. Manjula B.N. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Open table in a new tab PAMNS13 has previously been shown to interact with Glu-plasminogen with high affinity (Kd ∼ 1 nm) (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine the impact of the introduced mutations in the PAMNS13 binding site on plasminogen binding, solid-phase binding assays were performed utilizing biotinylated Glu-plasminogen. The recombinant PAM mutants bound plasminogen in a dose-dependant fashion, and saturable binding was achieved with 500 nm plasminogen for three of the five mutant proteins after 2 h (Fig. 3). Non-linear regression analysis was used to determine the affinity of each recombinant protein for Gluplasminogen (Table 2). Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated using a best-fit non-linear regression curve. The following site-directed mutants where residues were replaced with alanine, PAMNS13[Lys98–Lys111] and PAMNS13[Lys98–Arg101–His102–Glu104–Lys111], bound plasminogen with Kd values of 10.34 and 50.24 nm, respectively. Although this represents a significant decrease in affinity for Glu-plasminogen when compared with wild-type PAMNS13 (Kd = 1.58 nm; p < 0.05), binding by these mutants was still specific and saturable. PAMNS13[Arg101–His102] bound plasminogen with a Kd value of 1.69 nm, which is not significantly different fromthat of wild-type PAMNS13 (p > 0.05). Only nonspecific plasminogen binding was seen for mutants PAMNS13[Lys98–Arg101–His102–Glu104–Lys111–Arg114–His115] and PAMNS13[Arg101–His102–Arg114–His115], indicating that the arginine and histidine residues in both repeat domains are critical residues in the interaction of PAM with plasminogen. To further explore the contribution of these residues to the interaction with plasminogen, competition binding experiments were performed. The effective concentration of competitor required to inhibit plasminogen binding by 50% (EC50) was determined by fitting a one-site competition curve (Fig. 4). EC50 values ranged from 0.25 to 22.06 μm. This represents a >90% decrease in EC50 values for mutant proteins PAMNS13[Lys98–Lys111], PAMNS13[Lys98–Arg101–His102–Glu104–Lys111], and PAMNS13[Arg101–His102], when compared with wild-type PAMNS13. As expected, there was an inverse correlation between Kd and EC50 (Table 2). These data indicate that, although mutation of residues Lys98, Arg101, His102, Glu104, and Lys111 within the plasminogen binding repeats of PAMNS13 decreases the avidity of the interaction with plasminogen, the simultaneous mutation of residues Arg101, His102, Arg114, and His115 is required to fully abolish binding. A key feature of certain strains of S. pyogenes is the ability to migrate from cutaneous and mucosal surfaces to deep tissue sites, resulting in serious invasive infections such as bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. The exact mechanisms of GAS-invasive infection have yet to be fully explained, however one hypothesis involves the interaction of GAS with the host plasminogen activation system. Four GAS plasminogen-binding proteins have been described in the literature, as well as the secreted plasminogen activator streptokinase (2Walker M.J. McArthur J.D. McKay F. Ranson M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 308-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Lahteenmaki K. Kuusela P. Korhonen T.K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 531-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Sanderson-Smith M.L. McKay F.C. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Curr. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 1: 75-85Google Scholar, 29Cunningham M.W. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 470-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of potential virulence factors associated with S. pyogenes that interact with the plasminogen activation system necessitates a deeper understanding of the relationship of GAS with plasminogen. PAM is a cell surface-exposed, high affinity plasminogen receptor expressed by GAS associated with a variety of disease states, and it appears to play an integral role in the plasminogen-dependent virulence of PAM-positive GAS. In a recent study, it was shown that elimination of PAM-dependent plasminogen binding by GAS significantly reduced mortality in mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene (5Sun H. Ringdahl U. Homeister J.W. Fay W.P. Engleberg N.C. Yang A.Y. Rozek L.S. Wang X. Sjobring U. Ginsburg D. Science. 2004; 305: 1283-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the plasminogen binding domain of PAM is highly variable, this variation does not appear to significantly impact on the high affinity interaction of PAM with plasminogen. The conservation of binding function despite sequence diversity is indicative of the physiological significance of this interaction, and the ability of GAS to subvert the host plasminogen activation system (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The a1 and a2 repeat domains in the N terminus of PAM mediate binding to kringle 2 of plasminogen, with the a1 repeat residue Lys98 generally considered to make the greatest contribution to this interaction (6Berge A. Sjobring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wistedt A.C. Ringdahl U. Muller-Esterl W. Sjobring U. Mol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24420-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, this study indicates that residues Arg101 and His102 within the a1 repeat, together with residues Arg114 and His115 within the a2 repeat, are critical for the interaction of full-length PAM with plasminogen. The interaction with plasminogen of site-directed mutant PAMNS13 [Lys98–Lys111] in which residues Lys98 and Lys111 were mutated to alanines was dose-dependant and specific. Additionally, the Kd value for this interaction was within a physiologically relevant concentration of plasminogen, which circulates in the bloodstream at a concentration of ∼2 μm (3Dano K. Andreasen P.A. Grondahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of binding site residues Arg101, His102, Arg114, and His115 abolished plasminogen binding by PAMNS13 despite the presence of residues Lys98 and Lys111. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a non-lysine-dependent, high affinity interaction between plasminogen and a full-length naturally occurring receptor. Previous studies involving the interaction of a polypeptide sequence designated VEK-30 with modified kringle 2 of plasminogen highlighted the importance of PAM a1/a2 residues Lys98, Arg101, His102, Glu104, and Lys111 in the peptide-plasminogen interaction (15Schenone M.M. Warder S.E. Martin J.A. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 56: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 16Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Notably, VEK-30 lacks the final three residues of the a2 repeat (Arg114, His115, and Glu116). Mutation of residues Lys98, Arg101, His102, Glu104, and Lys111 in the full-length protein PAMNS13 in this study did not eliminate plasminogen binding. However, the avidity of this interaction was significantly reduced, as evidenced by a >90% decrease in EC50 values recorded for mutant proteins when compared with wild-type PAMNS13. This supports the previous finding that these residues are important in the interaction of PAM with plasminogen. However, the finding that mutation of arginine (Arg101 and Arg114) and histidine (His102 and His115) residues in both the a1 and a2 repeat was required to fully abrogate plasminogen binding suggests that both repeats are able to mediate high affinity interactions with plasminogen. Residues Arg101 and His102 of the a1 repeat of PAM have been shown to make numerous salt bridge and hydrophobic electrostatic interactions with recombinant kringle 2, forming a pseudo-ligand similar to the lysine analogue ϵ-aminocaproic acid (16Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the corresponding residues Arg114 and His115 in the a2 repeat interact with plasminogen in a similar fashion. The decrease in plasminogen binding by site-directed mutants reported here does not appear to be due to loss of secondary structure, because all site-directed mutants displayed CD spectra characteristic of coiled-coil α-helical proteins, similar to that of the wild-type PAMNS13. The percent α-helicity for mutants reported here was between 27% and 44%. CD analysis of other streptococcal M proteins has found them to contain between 23% and 70% α-helix (22Phillips Jr., G.N. Flicker P.F. Cohen C. Manjula B.N. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4689-4693Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Khandke K.M. Fairwell T. Acharya A.S. Trus B.L. Manjula B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5075-5082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the spectra for all α-helical proteins are not identical due to the small effect of non-aromatic side chains on the rotary strength of the peptide bond and occasional helix distortions (24Freifelder D.M. Physical Biochemistry. Applications to Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Second. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York1982Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the α-helical structure of the peptide VEK-30, representative of the a1 repeat of PAM, increases from 25% to 75% upon binding to kringle 2 of plasminogen (16Rios-Steiner J.L. Schenone M. Mochalkin I. Tulinsky A. Castellino F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that a similar structural shift could occur in the full-length PAM protein. No correlation was seen between percent α-helicity and plasminogen binding function, suggesting that any secondary structure changes have had only a minor influence on the differences in plasminogen binding described here. We have recently shown that, although the plasminogen binding domain of PAM is highly variable, this diversity does not abrogate plasminogen binding by naturally occurring PAM variants (12Sanderson-Smith M. Batzloff M. Sriprakash K.S. Dowton M. Ranson M. Walker M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3217-3226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these naturally occurring PAM variants, the Arg and His residues in both a1 and a2 repeat domains are highly conserved (11McKay F.C. McArthur J.D. Sanderson-Smith M.L. Gardam S. Currie B.J. Sriprakash K.S. Fagan P.K. Towers R.J. Batzloff M.R. Chhatwal G.S. Ranson M. Walker M.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in this study, a loss of plasminogen binding was only observed following simultaneous mutation of both the Arg101 and His102 residues in the a1 repeat, and the Arg114 and His115 residues in the a2 repeat. Therefore, conservation of Arg and His residues in either repeat domain may compensate for variation elsewhere in the binding repeats and explain the maintenance of high affinity plasminogen binding by naturally occurring variants of PAM. Recent findings that the acquisition of plasminogen by S. pyogenes may be crucial for the virulence of certain strains of GAS, and the ability of multiple GAS proteins to facilitate this process, necessitates a deeper understanding of the mechanisms via which certain GAS proteins interact with plasminogen. This study highlights for the first time the importance of highly conserved arginine (Arg101 and Arg114) and histidine (His102 and His115) residues within the binding site of the plasminogen-binding protein PAM, in mediating the interaction of this molecule with plasminogen. Such a finding may have implications for the identification of novel plasminogen-binding proteins in the future. We thank Dr. Teresa Treweek for her assistance with the CD analysis."

With the cell-attached configuration oleyl-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) induced single channel activity (75 pS) that was not observed in TRPC7–/– cells but was rescued by expression of TRPC7 under conditions expected to produce relatively low levels of expression (LowT7TRPC7–/–).

Single channel properties in LowT7TRPC7–/– or IP3RIP3R–/– DT40 cells were indistinguishable from one another and from wild-type cells. Thus, TRPC7 forms, or is part of, the channel underlying endogenous diacylglycerol-activated currents in DT40 B lymphocytes, and this activity of native TRPC7 requires IP3R.

Physiol. 2006; 68: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Physiologically, TRPC channels function as multifunctional calcium-permeable cation channels that can be activated through the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. However, whether individual TRPC members function as store-operated Ca2+ channels (whose activation is initiated by depletion of Ca2+ stores) and/or non-store-operated Ca2+ channels following PLC activation is still a matter of debate. Some of the confusion stems from the fact that, when heterologously expressed, their mode of regulation seems to be strongly dependent on cell type, expression level, or expression environment (discussed in Ref. 3Putney Jr., J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TRPC7 for instance, a member of the TRPC3/6/7 subfamily, was originally shown to function as a PLC-regulated channel (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A. Kurosaki T. Yamakuni T. Tanaka I. Shimizu S. Ikenaka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27359-27370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), presumably through PLC-derived diacylglycerol (DAG), but subsequent evidence indicated that it could also function as a store-operated Ca2+ channel (5Riccio A. Mattei C. Kelsell R.E. Medhurst A.D. Calver A.R. Randall A.D. Davis J.B. Benham C.D. Pangalos M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12302-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that these apparently contradictory findings likely resulted from differences in expression conditions (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine which of these two behaviors may correspond to the physiological function of native, endogenously expressed TRPC7, we recently utilized targeted homologous recombination to knock out TRPC7 in DT40 B lymphocytes. We found that knock out of TRPC7 did not significantly affect the store-operated calcium-selective current Icrac known to be expressed in these cells (7Lievremont J.P. Numaga T. Vazquez G. Lemonnier L. Hara Y. Mori E. Trebak M. Moss S.E. Bird G.S. Mori Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35346-35351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Rather, in the avian B-cell line, TRPC7 appears to function as a PLC-regulated, DAG-activated non-selective cation channel. However, previous studies from this laboratory (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and others (9Morita T. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Kurosaki T. Tojyo Y. Biochem.

Because aCa2+-impermeable mutant of the IP3R failed to rescue Ca2+ entry in IP3R knock-out cells, we speculated that this entry might involve plasma membrane IP3R (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present work, we further explored the role of native TRPC7 and IP3R in DT40 cells by characterizing the single channel properties of the channels underlying non-store-operated, DAG-activated currents and evaluating its dependence on IP3R expression.

When indicated, cells were transfected with either rat type 3 IP3 receptor (10 μg/ml) or the human isoform of TRPC7 (10 or 100 μg/ml; see “Results”) in pcDNA3 vector or vector alone (pcDNA3, mock-transfected cells), along with EYFP (5 μg) as marker for transfection. Cells were used for single channel measurements 20–25 h post-transfection. Fluorimetric evaluation of the rate of Ba2+ entry in IP3R–/– and IP3RIP3R–/– cells was performed as in Ref. 8Vazquez G.

Single channel currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique in the cell-attached configuration (12Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflüg. Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, Fl) and heat polished to form high resistance pipettes (∼7–10 MΩ) when filled with pipette solution. Unless otherwise stated, bath and pipette solution was (mm): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, adjusted with KOH. Signals were recorded at room temperature (20–22 °C) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), low pass filtered at 2 kHz, sampled at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1200 series interface using pClamp8 software (Axon), and then analyzed using Clampfit 9.2 program (Axon). Single channel amplitude at each holding potential was estimated as the averaged mean of the Gaussian fits to amplitude histograms of open events from individual patches obtained using the 50% threshold method with Clampfit 9.2. A correction was made for the rise time of the filter (13Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Google Scholar), so that events shorter than 250 μs (∼1.5 × filter rise time) were ignored. Distributions of apparent open and closed dwell times were constructed by plotting the logarithm of duration (in ms, 10 bins/decade) versus the square root of the number of events/bin (14Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and time constants were estimated by maximum likelihood fitting with sums of exponential functions using Clampfit 9 (Axon). Only patches in which one channel was apparent were included in this analysis, with the absence of simultaneous, superimposed openings used as an indicator of channel activity likely derived from the activity of one single channel. This assumption is in line with the observation that single channel activity and closed time constants were virtually identical between separate patches subject to similar experimental conditions. Additionally, the probability of runs of single openings if there were actually two channels present was estimated according to the equation: P (r ≥ no) = πno–1 (15Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-Channel Recording. Plenum Press, New York1995Google Scholar), where π = (1 – Po)/(1 – Po/2), and no is the number of single openings. For the patches analyzed here, the maximum probability of more than one channel present was of the order of ≤10–8. However, although unlikely, the possibility that more than one channel, each opening sporadically, generated single channel activity in these patches cannot be unequivocally ruled out; thus our estimation of apparent closed time constants should be taken as a lower limit for true values. Channel activity is expressed as NPo, the product of the number of channels in the patch (N) and the channel open probability, and was estimated as the ratio between the areas for closed and open points as derived from the all-points histogram. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of differences between means was established using Student's t test for unpaired samples. In a recent study (7Lievremont J.P. Numaga T. Vazquez G. Lemonnier L. Hara Y. Mori E. Trebak M. Moss S.E. Bird G.S. Mori Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35346-35351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) we reported responses to the synthetic DAG analog oleyl-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) in wild-type DT40 B lymphocytes by using conditions that provide strong inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). OAG-induced whole cell currents exhibited characteristics similar to those obtained upon PLC stimulation and, of significance, both PLC- and OAG-dependent whole cell currents were absent in TRPC7 knock-out (TRPC7–/–) DT40 cells, suggesting that the DAG-sensitive activity is mediated by channels containing native, endogenously expressed TRPC7. A more thorough evaluation of this interpretation requires electrophysiological characterization of the endogenous channels responsible for DAG-sensitive currents. In the present work, we carried out current measurements in the cell-attached configuration to obtain information on OAG-induced currents at the single channel level. After establishing the cell-attached configuration, current measurements were obtained for several minutes at membrane potentials between –60 and +60 mV. Under these conditions, i.e. in the absence of stimulation, there was no detectable single channel activity (0 of 8 cells). Similarly, application of 100 μm OAG to the bath resulted in no channel activity (0 of 7 cells; Fig. 1A, top trace). However, following inhibition of PKC (3-min preincubation with 1 μm Gö6976 and 0.5 μm calphostin C), challenging the cells with 100 μm OAG resulted in appearance of single channel activity (8 of 12; Fig. 1A, bottom trace). The mean amplitude of open events was 4.5 ± 0.13 pA at +60 mV (all-points histogram is shown in Fig. 1B), giving a single channel conductance of 75 ± 2.1 pS. This value is very similar to that reported for ectopically expressed human TRPC7 (71 pS) by Lemonnier et al. (16Lemonnier L. Trebak M. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and somewhat larger than the value reported for the murine channel (49 pS) by Shi et al. (17Shi J. Mori E. Mori Y. Mori M. Li J. Ito Y. Inoue R. J. Physiol. 2004; 561: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The single channel currents were linear with a reversal potential close to 0 mV and were not significantly affected by replacing K+ in the pipette solution by either Cs+ or Na+ (140 mm Cs+ or Na+/10 mm Cl–), consistent with a nonselective cation channel (not shown). Channel activity (NPo) was 0.09 ± 0.01. Single channel activity was not observed in the absence of PKC inhibitors (0 of 7) or following addition of PKC inhibitors alone (0 of 7), indicating that channel activity was dependent on OAG and sensitive to inhibition by PKC. To obtain information on the kinetics of single channel behavior, we analyzed the dwell time distributions for apparent open and closed times. These were well fitted by the sum of two and three exponential components, for open and closed states, respectively, indicating the existence of at least two open (O1 and O2) and three closed (C1-C3) channel states (Fig. 1C). Table 1 summarizes the time constants and corresponding relative areas for these states. Open time distributions showed a major, highly populated component with a time constant of 1.34 ± 0.18 ms (∼81% of events) and a longer component with a time constant of 7.44 ± 0.79 ms (∼19% of events). Closed time distributions showed three components, of which the shortest (C1, mean duration ∼0.88 ms) and the longest (C3, mean duration ∼170 ms) were relatively equally populated. These estimated parameters will be used to compare single channel properties under the conditions described below.TABLE 1Time constants for distributions of apparent open and closed timesStateWild-typeaValues correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells pretreated with PKC inhibitors.LowT7TRPC7-/-aValues correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells pretreated with PKC inhibitors.IP3RIP3R-/-aValues correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells pretreated with PKC inhibitors.HighT7IP3R-/-bValues correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells not treated with PKC inhibitors.O11.33 ± 0.181.34 ± 0.21.26 ± 0.210.58 ± 0.16*(0.81 ± 0.04)(0.81 ± 0.05)(0.80 ± 0.05)(0.94 ± 0.02)O27.44 ± 0.798.27 ± 0.778.47 ± 0.836.42 ± 1.14(0.19 ± 0.03)(0.19 ± 0.06)(0.20 ± 0.04)(0.06 ± 0.02)C10.88 ± 0.120.72 ± 0.110.72 ± 0.190.88 ± 0.22(0.46 ± 0.04)(0.42 ± 0.04)(0.43 ± 0.06)(0.35 ± 0.02)C214.37 ± 2.7213.07 ± 2.0014.45 ± 2.858.99 ± 1.27(0.14 ± 0.02)(0.18 ± 0.02)(0.17 ± 0.06)(0.46 ± 0.02)C3171.34 ± 23.43179.91 ± 17.88146.33 ± 20.5554.01 ± 9.14**(0.39 ± 0.03)(0.40 ± 0.04)(0.39 ± 0.02)(0.19 ± 0.03)a Values correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells pretreated with PKC inhibitors.b Values correspond to OAG-induced single channel activity in cells not treated with PKC inhibitors.

Consistent with this, OAG-induced single channel events were not observed in TRPC7–/– cells (0 of 12 cells) despite the presence of PKC inhibitors, supporting the view that native TRPC7 mediates DAG-sensitive channel activity. We next sought to rescue the effects of TRPC7 deletion by transiently transfecting TRPC7–/– cells with a plasmid encoding for human TRPC7, together with EYFP as transfection marker. In DT40 cells, TRPC3 and TRPC7 expression levels are influenced by simple manipulation of the plasmid concentration used in the transfection reaction. In previous studies (7Lievremont J.P. Numaga T.

Of importance, for TRPC7 the resulting Ca2+ entry and membrane currents displayed pharmacological and regulatory properties that closely resembled those from wild-type cells (7Lievremont J.P.

Transfection of TRPC7–/– cells with TRPC7-encoding plasmid under conditions of presumably low level of expression (LowT7TRPC7–/– cells) did not rescue OAG-induced single channel activity in the absence of PKC inhibitors (0 of 7 EYFP+ cells; Fig. 2A, top trace). However, when cells were pretreated with PKC inhibitors, OAG-dependent single channel activity was observed (7 of 12 EYFP+ cells; Fig. 2A, bottom trace). Notably, single channel characteristics closely resembled those from wild-type cells, with a major peak amplitude at + 60 mV of 4.5 ± 0.1 pA (all-points histogram is shown in Fig. 2A), a conductance of 75 ± 1.4 pS, reversal potential near 0 mV, and an NPo value of 0.11 ± 0.02 (see also Fig. 4). Distributions of apparent open and closed times were again well fitted by the sum of two and three exponential components, respectively, with open and closed time constants and corresponding frequency probabilities that were not statistically different from those obtained for the wild-type channel (Table 1). TRPC7–/– cells transfected with empty vector did not show OAG-induced channel activity (0 of 6 EYFP+ cells) despite the presence of PKC inhibitors.FIGURE 4Summarized properties of OAG-induced single channel activity.

Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We found that a mutant DT40 cell line lacking all three IP3 receptor isoforms (IP3R–/– cells) also lacked this PLC-dependent non-store-operated cation entry, a finding more recently confirmed by others (9Morita T. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Kurosaki T. Tojyo Y. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 10van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Kiselyov K. Boehning D. Barrow R.K. Gill D.L. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If DT40 cells express only a single non-store-operated entry involving TRPC7, one would expect that the lack of non-store-operated cation entry in IP3R–/– cells would be accompanied by absence of the OAG-regulated cation entry pathway. As predicted, neither OAG-induced Ba2+ entry, whole cell currents, nor single channel events were observed in IP3R–/– cells (not shown) regardless of the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors. The simplest interpretation for these findings is that IP3 receptor expression is in some manner required for proper function of native DAG-sensitive TRPC7 channels. To examine this possibility more directly, we attempted to restore OAG-sensitive channel activity in IP3R–/– cells by transient expression of the type 3 isoform of the rat IP3 receptor (designated IP3RIP3R–/– cells). Expression of the type 3 isoform of the rat IP3 receptor in the IP3R–/– cells restores BCR-dependent, IP3-mediated release of stored Ca2+, an indication not only of appropriate localization and functional expression of this IP3 receptor but also of proper coupling to the endogenous cell's signaling machinery (Ref. 8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar and data not shown). As predicted, in the presence of PKC inhibitors (6 of 10 EYFP+ cells), but not in their absence (0 of 7 EYFP+ cells), IP3RIP3R–/– cells showed single channel activity in response to OAG (Fig. 2B), with single channel characteristics indistinguishable from those found in LowT7TRPC7–/– cells as well as in wild-type cells (peak amplitude at +60 mV of 4.26 ± 0.1 pA, 75 ± 1.4 pS, Erev ∼ 0 mV, and an NPo value of 0.12 ± 0.03; see also Fig. 4). Time constants derived from distributions of apparent open and closed times, and corresponding frequency probabilities, were comparable with those derived for single channel activity in wild-type and LowT7TRPC7–/– cells (Table 1). Additionally, in IP3RIP3R–/– cells OAG-induced Ba2+ entry was also restored (initial rate of Ba2+ entry: 0.015 ± 0.005 and 0.047 ± 0.007 ratio units/min, for mock- and IP3R-transfected IP3R–/– cells, respectively; n = 6–7 EYFP+ cells, p < 0.04). Importantly, expression of the rat IP3 receptor in TRPC7–/– cells did not rescue OAG-dependent channel activity nor did transient transfection of TRPC7 into IP3R–/– cells (not shown). We have previously shown that in its non-store-operated mode, TRPC3, a closely related subfamily member of TRPC7, is able to function independently of IP3R (20Trebak M. Bird G.St. J. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16244-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, we have also shown that for both TRPC3 and TRPC7 channel expression level dramatically influences channel regulation (6Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1709-C1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Trebak M. Bird G.St. J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Thus, we next examined whether or not the strict requirement on IP3 receptor expression seen here for TRPC7 was related to channel expression conditions. IP3R–/– cells were transfected with TRPC7 but this time using a 10-fold larger quantity (100 μg/ml) of TRPC7-encoding, cytomegalovirus-driven pcDNA3.1 plasmid, a condition known to result in higher levels of channel expression (7Lievremont J.P.

Under these conditions, HighT7IP3R–/– cells exhibited a high level of single channel activity in response to OAG (6 of 10 EYFP+ cells; Fig. 3A) but now without the necessity of PKC inhibitors. Although single channel conductance (72 ± 1.7 pS) and reversal potential (near 0 mV) were comparable with that estimated for the channel in either wild-type, LowT7TRPC7–/–, or IP3RIP3R–/– cells, channel activity was higher (NPo = 0.21 ± 0.02; p < 0.04), as was whole cell current density (Fig. 4). Channel activity was clearly independent of the IP3R in these cells because activity was no greater when similar transfections were carried out with wild-type cells (NPo = 0.24 + 0.03, n = 3). Distributions of apparent open and closed times (Fig. 3C and Table 1) showed that the channel in HighT7IP3R–/– cells was characterized by a significant reduction in the duration of the shortest open state, with a time constant of 0.58 ± 0.16 ms, less than half that of wild-type channels (1.33 ± 0.18 ms, p < 0.01; Fig. 4). Notably, this short-lived open state was highly populated (0.94 ± 0.02, p < 0.02 compared with the equivalent fractional area in wild-type) and had a relative probability more than twice that of the wild-type channel (p < 0.002). Additionally, there was a clear reduction in both duration (–67%, p < 0.006) and population (–31%, p < 0.03, Table 1) of the long closed state, in keeping with a higher channel activity characterized by short and more frequent openings. Fig. 4 summarizes the main properties of OAG-induced single channel activity in the three DT40 cell lines tested and under different expression conditions for TRPC7. Several novel conclusions can be drawn from the present findings. For the first time, endogenous OAG-sensitive channels in DT40 B lymphocytes have been characterized at the single channel level. There was no evidence of spontaneous channel activity in the absence of stimulation or after challenging the cells with OAG; however, OAG-induced single channel activity was observed following inhibition of PKC, suggesting that native channels are negatively regulated through a PKC-dependent mechanism, as was shown for ectopically expressed TRPC3 (Ref. 21Trebak M. Hempel N. Wedel B.J. Smyth J.T. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and see below). Single channel activity was low and exhibited characteristics consistent with a nonselective cation channel, whose dwell time distributions revealed the existence of, at least, two open and three closed states. This channel activity completely disappears after knock out of the endogenous TRPC7 gene. Importantly, not only is OAG-dependent channel activity fully restored by transfection of TRPC7 into TRPC7–/– cells but also the biophysical properties of the rescued channel are indistinguishable from those of the wild-type channel. These findings strongly support our hypothesis that TRPC7 forms, or is part of, native DAG-regulated channels in DT40 B lymphocytes. This is the first demonstration that the activity of native TRPC7 channels has a strict requirement for IP3 receptors. Previous work in DT40 cells described a dependence of the non-store-operated, PLC-regulated cation entry on IP3 receptors (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Morita T. Tanimura A. Nezu A. Kurosaki T. Tojyo Y. Biochem.

A. 2004; 101: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Those studies showed that in a mutant DT40 cell line lacking all three IP3 receptor isoforms (IP3R–/– cells) the PLC-dependent non-store-operated cation entry was deficient, whereas it could be rescued by re-expression of the IP3 receptor. Although the precise role of IP3 receptors in that process was not clear, the simplest interpretation of our findings (8Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Bird G.St. J. Joseph S.K. Putney Jr., J.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4531-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was that plasma membrane resident IP3 receptors were the channels mediating that process. Here, however, we have shown that the channel rescued by IP3 receptor re-expression in the IP3R–/– cells is indistinguishable from either the channel detected in wild-type cells or the channel rescued by TRPC7 expression in TRPC7–/– cells, suggesting that, rather than plasma membrane IP3 receptors, it is TRPC7 that forms, or is part of, the channel mediating the DAG-sensitive component of the non-store-operated cation entry in DT40 B lymphocytes. Why then is DAG-dependent channel activity deficient in IP3R–/– cells, and what is the basis for its dependence on IP3 receptor expression? Regardless of the controversy derived from functional studies aimed at addressing the role of IP3 receptors in modulation of TRPC channels (reviewed in Refs. 1Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O. Trebak M. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and 22Trebak M. Vazquez G. Bird G.St. J. Putney Jr., J.W.

In our previous study (7Lievremont J.P. Numaga T. Vazquez G. Lemonnier L. Hara Y. Mori E. Trebak M. Moss S.E. Bird G.S. Mori Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35346-35351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), introduction of IP3 into DT40 cells via a patch pipette activated only Icrac, and this current did not depend upon the presence of TRPC7. Therefore, it remains the simplest interpretation of the current findings and data from preceding studies that DAG, and not IP3, is the signal for activation of members of the TRPC3/6/7 subfamily. The requirement for IP3R expression shown here for native TRPC7 channels may therefore reflect a role of the IP3R either in correct targeting of TRPC7 channels or in correct assembly of TRPC7 channels as part of a signaling complex. It is important to note, however, that the present experimental conditions would not likely reveal IP3-induced, IP3 receptor-mediated cationic currents. Thus, we do not rule out the possibility that plasma membrane resident IP3 receptors may also exist as a contributing component of the non-store-operated pathway in DT40 cells. If this is the case, a tight reciprocal regulation must exist between TRPC7 and IP3 receptors so that down-regulation of one path strongly affects the function of the other. Clearly, further studies are required to define not only the exact function and location of the IP3 receptor in the signaling mechanism for TRPC7 but also to define the degree, if any, to which IP3 receptor channels contribute to non-store-operated currents in DT40 cells. In IP3R–/– cells low levels of TRPC7 expression did not rescue OAG-sensitive single channel currents, but expression of TRPC7 at higher levels (HighT7IP3R–/–) resulted in appearance of OAG-induced channel activity, i.e. independently of IP3 receptor expression. At this higher expression level, channel activation by OAG did not depend on PKC inhibition. Thus, the situation with high expression of TRPC7 recapitulates earlier findings with expression of TRPC3 and TRPC7 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (4Okada T. Inoue R. Yamazaki K. Maeda A.

Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21649-21654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). How can we interpret these differences in channel behavior and regulation within the context of differences in channel expression level? In the simplest view, one can envision that under low expression conditions channel protein levels more closely correspond to native protein levels, thus allowing TRPC7 to combine with endogenous proteins, limited in number, that either form part of, or act as accessory/regulatory subunits (e.g. IP3 receptor) at the channel complex; the result is a channel complex that more closely matches the native stoichiometry. On the other hand, when higher levels of channel expression are attained, by virtue of the sheer number of TRPC7 molecules a limited proportion, but significant number, of functional channels may be formed. In line with this interpretation, the relationship between OAG-induced whole cell and single channel currents gives an estimated number of channels of ∼80/cell for wild-type, LowT7TRPC7–/–, and IP3RIP3R–/– cells and ∼220/cell for HighT7IP3R–/– cells. As a consequence, high levels of expression of TRPC7 may result in channels whose activity is either uncoupled from or no longer limited by endogenous factors. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that channel activity in HighT7IP3R–/– cells is significantly higher and characterized by short and more frequent openings than channel activity in wild-type, LowT7TRPC7–/–, or IP3RIP3R–/– cells; this may indicate a role for IP3R in regulating channel gating properties of TRPC7 channels. Also in line with this reasoning is the observation that OAG regulation of single channel activity in HighT7IP3R–/– cells is not affected by PKC, whereas when TRPC7 is expressed at native, low levels (e.g. wild-type, LowT7TRPC7–/–, and IP3RIP3R–/– cells) responses to OAG are evident only if PKC is inhibited, suggesting that native channels are negatively regulated by PKC. This may also explain why many cell types are unresponsive to OAG treatment despite endogenous expression of one or more members of the TRPC3/6/7 group (see Refs. 1Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O.

Previous studies on the role of IP3 receptors in modulation of TRPC channels have yielded conflicting results, TRPC3 being an inveterate example (reviewed in Refs. 1Vazquez G. Wedel B.J. Aziz O.

However, Trebak et al. (20Trebak M. Bird G.St. J. McKay R.R. Birnbaumer L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

These apparently disparate findings can now be at least somewhat reconciled. Although it appears that when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells TRPC3 functions independently of IP3R, it may, like TRPC7, require IP3R for proper function when natively expressed. Thus, it would not be surprising to find that application of an IP3R to these uncoupled channels would result in an increase in channel activity. In summary, in the current study we have shown that endogenously expressed TRPC7 channels in DT40 B lymphocytes are activated by DAG in an IP3R-dependent manner. Increasing the expression of TRPC7 produces a channel with altered kinetic properties and that becomes independent of the IP3 receptor. This underscores the emerging principle that important properties of ion channel function can be lost when the channels are overexpressed at high levels. In addition, these results serve to at least partially reconcile previous disparate findings regarding the relative roles of DAG and IP3R-mediated regulation of TRPC cation channels.

In mice, production of mature Paneth cell α-defensins, termed cryptdins (Crps), requires proteolytic activation of inactive precursors (pro-Crps) by the convertase matrix metalloproteinase-7. Proteolysis of mouse (pro-Crp4)20-92 produces the specific cleavage intermediates pro-Crp444-92, pro-Crp454-92, and pro-Crp459-92. To identify which cleavage event enables bactericidal activity, recombinant pro-Crp4-processing intermediates were purified to homogeneity and assayed for bactericidal peptide activity. The in vitro bactericidal activities of pro-Crp4-processing intermediates were very similar to fully processed Crp4, contrasting the lack of bactericidal and membrane-disruptive activity shown by pro-Crp420-92. Thus, cleavage of pro-Crp420-92 at Ser43↓Ile44 is sufficient to activate bactericidal activity, and amino acids in the pro-Crp420-43 of the proregion maintain the precursor in an inactive state. Because cationic Arg residues are determinants of Crp4 bactericidal peptide activity, we hypothesized that Asp and Glu residues in pro-Crp420-43 neutralize Crp4 Arg side chains in pro-Crp420-92. Therefore, a pro-Crp420-92 variant with Gly substitutions at all pro-Crp420-43 Asp and Glu positions ((DE/G)-pro-Crp4) was prepared, and it was bactericidal and lysed phospholipid vesicles under conditions where native pro-Crp420-92 lacks activity. These findings show that MMP-7 proteolysis of pro-Crp420-92 at Ser43↓Ile44 converts inactive precursors to bactericidal forms by removal of covalently associated, inhibitory acidic amino acids from proximity with the Crp4 component of the molecule.

Further evidence implicating α-defensins in Paneth cell secretions as mediators of innate enteric immunity derives from studies of mice transgenic for the human Paneth cell α-defensin HD-5. The transgenic mice are immune to oral infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), a highly virulent pathogen for wild-type mice (8Salzman N.H. Ghosh D. Huttner K.M.

These considerations provide rationale for determining the mechanisms regulating the production and functional maturation of these peptide effectors. Biosynthesis of α-defensins requires post-translational activation of inactive proforms by lineage-specific proteinases (6Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S.

Whether myeloid or Paneth cell in origin, α-defensins are expressed as pre-propeptides consisting of co-translationally cleaved signal sequences, acidic prosegments, and an α-defensin peptide localized in the C-terminal region of the precursor (10Daher K.A.

In contrast, human Paneth cells store and secrete unprocessed pro-α-defensins, which are activated by anionic and meso trypsin isoforms that co-localize with HD-5 in secretory granules (9Ghosh D.

Trypsin cleaves pro-HD-5 at Arg55↓Ala56 and Arg62↓Thr63 to produce mature HD-5, with Arg55↓Ala56 proteolysis inducing activation. In mice, all Paneth cell pro-Crps investigated are processed by MMP-7 cleavage at three conserved sites: Ser43↓Ile/Val44, Ala53↓Leu54, and Ser58↓Leu59, which activates bactericidal activity and enables membrane disruptive activity (14Shirafuji Y.

The bactericidal activity of mouse Paneth cell α-defensins, termed cryptdins (Crps), correlates directly with the ability to interact with and disrupt membranes.

To identify which cleavage event activates pro-Crp4, recombinant pro-Crp4-processing intermediates were prepared and tested for bactericidal and membrane-disruptive capabilities. Here, we report that the Ser43↓Ile44 cleavage event is sufficient to convert inactive pro-Crp4 to a fully functional state, despite the presence of a 17-amino acid N-terminal extension. Furthermore, 9 acidic amino acid residue positions in pro-Crp420-43 of the proregion are shown to maintain pro-Crp4 in an inactive state prior to MMP-7 proteolysis at Ser43↓Ile44.

Vesicles consisting of dimyristoylphosphatidycholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidyglycerol (DMPG), and polydiacetylene (PDA) (1:1:3 molar ratio) were prepared as described previously (18Satchell D.P.

Phospholipids (Sigma) and 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid monomer (GFS Chemicals, Powell, OH) were dissolved in chloroform/ethanol (1:1) and dried together in vacuo to constant weight. The lipid film was suspended in deionized water, probe-sonicated for 3 min at 70 °C, and incubated overnight at 4 °C. PDA was polymerized by irradiation at 254 nm for 30 s, producing suspensions with an intense blue appearance. Peptides at concentrations varying from 0.2 to 3 μm were added to 60 μl of vesicle solutions (0.5 mm total lipid) in 25 mm Tris-base (pH 8.0), diluted to 1 ml by deionized water, and spectra were acquired at 28 °C between 400 and 700 nm on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-cm optical path cell. Blue-red color transitions within the vesicle solutions, defined as the percent colorimetric response (%CR), were calculated as described previously (18Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Shirafuji Y.

Peptide Interactions with Large Unilamellar Vesicles—Recombinant pro-Crp4 and peptide variants were investigated for the ability to induce leakage from large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles (LUV) of defined composition. LUV of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL) were loaded with a fluorophore/quencher system (22Smolarsky M. Teitelbaum D. Sela M. Gitler C. J. Immunol.

Aqueous lipid solutions consisting of 17 mm 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (ANTS, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 60.5 mm p-xylenebispyridinium bromide (DPX, Molecular Probes), 10 mm HEPES, 31 mm NaCl, and 19.5 mm NaOH (260 mosm/liter, pH 7.4) were vortexed, frozen, and thawed for 5 cycles and then extruded through polycarbonate filters with 100 nm pores. Vesicles were separated from unencapsulated ANTS/DPX by gel-permeation chromatography with 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 4.5 mm NaOH (260 mosm/liter, pH 7.4) as column eluant. Vesicular suspensions diluted with eluant buffer to ∼74 μm of total lipid were incubated with peptides at ambient temperature. Time-dependent fluorescence produced by ANTS release was monitored at 520 nm (excitation at 353 nm) as described previously (19Satchell D.P. Sheynis T. Kolusheva S. Cummings J. Vanderlick T.K.

Thus, 4-h values were expressed relative to fluorescence obtained by vesicular solubilization with Triton X-100. E. coli ML35 Permeabilization Measured by ONPG Conversion—Exponentially growing E. coli ML35 cells were washed and resuspended in 10 mm PIPES-TSB. Bacteria were exposed in triplicate to Crp4, pro-Crp4, pro-Crp444-92, pro-Crp454-92, and (DE/G)-pro-Crp4 in the presence of 2.5 mm ONPG for 2 h at 37 °C. E. coli ML35, which express β-galactosidase constitutively and are permease-negative, does not take up ONPG unless permeabilized by external factors, such as defensins. β-Galactosidase hydrolysis of ONPG was measured at 405 nm on a 96-well Spectra-Max plate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). NMR Assay of Defensin Structure—Pro-Crp420-92, pro-Crp444-92, pro-Crp454-92, and (DE/G)-pro-Crp4-92) were lyophilized and dissolved in 90% H2O/10% D2O or D2O at final protein concentrations between 300 μm and 1 mm. NMR data were collected on a Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY, τm 200 and 300 ms), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY, τm 45 ms), and double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) experiments were performed. The water signal was eliminated using WATERGATE (24Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3526) Google Scholar). In each case, 1024 × 256 complex points were collected and shifted, sine-squared apodization and zero-filling to twice the data size were applied prior to Fourier transform. Data were processed using NMRPipe (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11561) Google Scholar) and were analyzed using Sparky (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/). Assignments for Crp4 from a previous study (26Jing W. Hunter H.N. Tanabe H. Ouellette A.J. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15759-15766Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were confirmed and compared with those of pro-Crp420-92, pro-Crp444-92, pro-Crp454-92, and (DE/G)-pro-Crp4. Disulfide Arrays of Recombinant Peptides—Pro-Crp444-92 and pro-Crp454-92 are pro-Crp4 variants with N termini that correspond to the canonical MMP-7-catalyzed cleavage events at Ser43↓Ile44 and Ala53↓Leu54 (14Shirafuji Y.

The pro-Crp4-processing intermediates were purified to homogeneity by C18 reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, which was verified by AU-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B), and peptide masses were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (not shown). Pro-Crp420-92, pro-Crp444-92, and pro-Crp454-92 molecules were shown to have correct CI-CVI,CII-CIV, and CIII-CV disulfide connectivities by NMR spectrometry (Fig. 2), ruling out the possibility that peptide bactericidal activities could result from disrupted α-defensin cysteine pairings. Sequential assignments were made through each strand of the beta sheet using NOESY and TOCSY CHα-NH connectivities. DQF-COSY and TOCSY data were used to determine the identity of each spin system and confirm backbone assignments. Sections of NOESY spectra that include the cysteine side chain α and β protons for pro-Crp420-92, pro-Crp444-92, pro-Crp454-92, and (DE/G)-pro-Crp4 (Fig. 2) confirmed that the disulfide connectivities correspond to those of native α-defensins. In addition, analysis of backbone NOEs demonstrates existence of a β-strand conformation with a register identical to that of Crp4. Therefore, all recombinant peptides investigated in these experiments were confirmed by NMR to contain tridisulfide arrays characteristic of α-defensins. MMP-7 Proteolysis of Pro-Crp4 at Ser43↓Ile44 Confers Bactericidal Activity—The activating cleavage event in pro-Crp4 processing was determined by analysis of recombinant pro-Crp4-processing intermediates. At 3 μm final peptide concentration, pro-Crp444-92 and pro-Crp454-92 and Crp4 had equivalent bactericidal activities in in vitro bactericidal assays against E. coli ML35, V. cholerae, S. aureus 502a, L. monocytogenes, and S. Typhimurium ΔphoP. The biological variability evident in bactericidal assays at low peptide concentrations may be due to steric effects of the N-terminal extensions in the pro-Crp444-92 and pro-Crp454-92 molecules.

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 1518–1524). In the present report, we analyze functional consequences of mutating each of the three acidic amino acids in this loop into cysteines. Among the mutants, only the E142C substitution impairs selectively Na+-sugar translocation. Because R141C has a similar defect, we investigated these two mutants in more detail. Liposomes containing purified mutated melibiose permease were adsorbed onto a solid supported lipid membrane, and transient electrical currents resulting from different substrate concentration jumps were recorded. The currents evoked by a melibiose concentration jump in the presence of Na+, previously assigned to an electrogenic conformational transition (Meyer-Lipp, K., Ganea, C., Pourcher, T., Leblanc, G., and Fendler, K. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 12606–12613), were much smaller for the two mutants than the corresponding signals in cysteineless MelB. Furthermore, in R141C the stimulating effect of melibiose on Na+ affinity was lost. Finally, whereas tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy revealed impaired conformational changes upon melibiose binding in the mutants, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements indicated that the mutants still show cooperative modification of their sugar binding sites by Na+. These data suggest that: 1) loop 4–5 contributes to the coordinated interactions between the ion and sugar binding sites; 2) it participates in an electrogenic conformational transition after melibiose binding that is essential for the subsequent obligatory coupled translocation of substrates.

A two-step mechanism for substrate translocation in the melibiose permease is suggested. Co-transporters catalyzing specifically the transfer of organic substrates and ions across membranes are of primary importance for the life of cells. One of these co-transporters belonging to the galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides transport family (1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J. Liang W.J. Leblanc G. Pourcher T. Mus-Veteau I.

MelB functions as a secondary active co-transporter that links uphill solute transport (α-galactosides, such as 6-O-α-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose (melibiose), or β-galactosides, such as methyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside) to a downhill electrochemical ion gradient. It is most unusual in its ability to use either H+, Na+, or Li+ as coupling ion depending on which sugar is being transported (reviews in Refs. 1Poolman B. Knol J. van der Does C. Henderson P.J.

Consisting of 473 amino acids, this highly hydrophobic protein (70% apolar) has 12 transmembrane-spanning α-helices, organized as two asymmetric domains, each containing 6 helices, with its N and C termini facing the cytoplasm of the bacterium (6Hacksell I.

While awaiting improved resolution of the MelB structure, other techniques are being used to understand better the functioning of this transporter and identify amino acids involved in substrate binding and/or translocation. For example, for MelB, Asp-19 (helix I), Asp-55 (helix II), Asp-59 (helix II), and Asp-124 (helix IV) have been shown to be essential for cation binding and Asn-58 (helix II) for cation recognition (10Pourcher T.

Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis is now a widely used strategy to study systematically the structure and structure-function relationship of membrane proteins. It is currently applied to MelB using a fully functional active permease devoid of its four native cysteines (Cys-less permease) (15Weissborn A.C. Botfield M.C. Kuroda M. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) as genetic background. Extensive cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies concentrated thus far mainly on membrane domains of MelB. However, three observations led us to focus on the role of the highly charged cytoplasmic loop 4–5 for MelB symport activity. First, MelB substrates protect the protein cooperatively against proteolysis of loop 4–5 (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Second, active-site-directed labeling of the protein showed that the arginyl residue 141 of this same loop is a melibiose-protected target of labeling with a photoactivatable azidophenyl sugar analog (16Ambroise Y. Leblanc G. Rousseau B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From the latter study, it was concluded that loop 4–5 is either directly involved in Na+ and/or sugar binding or contributes indirectly to the coupling interaction between the two binding sites. Third, among the positively charged amino acids of loop 4–5 that were individually replaced by a cysteine, only R141C, although able to bind the substrates, showed defects in the translocation process (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggesting that loop 4–5 is close to the sugar binding site and may participate directly in co-substrate translocation. In the present study, we bring additional evidence for an important role of loop 4–5 for the functioning and cooperative behavior of MelB. We analyzed the effects of individual cysteine replacement of the three negatively charged residues; i.e. D137C, E140C, and E142C. Because among the mutants only E142C showed substrate translocation defects, this mutant, together with the previously characterized R141C mutant (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was investigated in detail by combining kinetic, electrophysiological, and fluorescence spectroscopy approaches. In particular, we analyzed transient electrical currents recorded from R141C and E142C by using the solid supported membrane (SSM) technique. The SSM has already been used to monitor electrogenic events associated to partial steps of the Na+ melibiose symport reaction (5Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13744-13752Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18Meyer-Lipp K. Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12606-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In combination with spectroscopic evidence, the results suggest that loop 4–5 contributes to the coordinated interactions between the ion and sugar binding sites and participates in conformational changes after melibiose binding. Materials—Synthesis and labeling of p-nitrophenyl α-d-6-[3H]galactopyranoside (α-[3H]NPG) or 6-O-α-d-[3H]galactopyranosyl-d-glucose ([3H]melibiose), and synthesis of 2′-(N-dansyl)-aminoethyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Dns2-S-Gal) were carried out by Dr. B. Rousseau and Y. Ambroise (Département de Biologie Joliot Curie/CEA-Saclay, France). Highest purity grade reagents (KH2PO4, Sigma, 0.005% Na+ and KOH Merck, suprapur, 0.002% Na+) were used to prepare nominally Na+-free media (contaminating Na+ level of <20 μm as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy). 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide, MPB), 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (stilbene disulfonate), and the streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The methanethiosulfonate derivatives (MTS reagents) were from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada).

Freshly transformed cells were grown at 30 °C in M9 medium supplemented with glycerol (5 g/liter), casamino acids (0.2%), thiamine (0.5 mg/liter), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until an A600 of 1–1.2 was reached.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were submitted to repeated freeze/thaw/sonication wash cycles in nominally Na+-free, 0.1 m KPi (pH 7) to eliminate Na+ (contaminating level <10 μm as determined by flame photometry). Purity of the reconstituted MelB was assessed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE. Protein content was measured in the presence of SDS by a Lowry assay. Identification of Second Site Revertants—E. coli expressing E142C grew initially as pale rose colonies on 1% melibiose MacConkey agar plates. After 3–5 days of incubation at 37 °C, small red areas appeared that were picked and re-streaked for colony purification. After isolation of the plasmid DNA, mutations responsible for fermentation recovery were identified by sequencing. Sugar Transport in Cells—Freshly grown cells were concentrated to 2 mg of protein/ml in 0.1 m KPi (pH 7). The time course of transport of [3H]melibiose (0.4 mm, 20 mCi/mmol) in the presence or absence of NaCl or LiCl at a concentration of 10 mm was monitored at 22 °C by a rapid filtration procedure (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Variation of transport rate and extent never exceeded 15% from batch to batch. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was applied to samples containing protein solubilized from RSO membrane vesicles (∼20 μg) and probed with a mouse anti-C-terminal MelB and an anti-mouse secondary antibody (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as the percentage of the signal recorded from membranes carrying the Cys-less permease. Binding Assays—α-[3H]NPG binding to RSO membrane vesicles (20 mg/ml) and determination of binding constants were assessed at room temperature by a flow dialysis procedure as described previously (4Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6893-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Entrance Counterflow Activity—Counterflow activity was assessed in RSO membrane vesicles (20 mg/ml) at room temperature as described (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Solid Supported Membrane Set-up and Measuring Procedure—Proteoliposomes containing Cys-less, R141C, or E142C MelB were adsorbed to the SSM (5Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13744-13752Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Pintschovius J. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 827-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activating and non-activating solutions for SSM measurements contained 0.1 m KPi (pH 7) plus NaCl/KCl and melibiose/glucose at concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Transient currents upon addition of one or both of the co-substrates were recorded. The solution exchange protocols were as described (5Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13744-13752Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22 °C). Fluorescence Assays—An LS 50 fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to measure the Na+-dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signals (λex = 297 nm, bandpass 5 nm, λem = 410–540 nm) arising from proteoliposomes (20 μg/ml) incubated in the presence of 10 μm of the sugar fluorescent analog Dns2-S-Gal (25Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The specific FRET signals were normalized for variation (<20%) in the amount of permeases in the different proteoliposome preparations according to a previous study (26Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33198-33202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 297 nm, bandpass 5 nm, λem = 310–380 nm) arising from proteoliposomes (20 μg/ml) was recorded as described (27Mus-Veteau I. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6775-6783Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Orientation of the Protein in the Liposome—Liposome suspensions containing purified Cys-less or single cysteine R139C (∼0.25 mg of protein/ml, in 0.1 m KPi, pH 7) were supplemented with 10 μm MPB and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. MPB was added from a stock prepared in Me2SO. The concentration of Me2SO in the labeling medium did not exceed 1% (v/v). Some samples were afterward subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw sonication in the presence of MPB. Where indicated, samples were pretreated with 200 μm of the membrane-impermeable thiolstilbene disulfonate for 10 min at room temperature. Stilbene disulfonate was washed away by three cycles of centrifugation with 0.1 m KPi, pH 7. As negative control, the Cys-less transporter was incubated with varying concentrations of MPB (0–1000 μm) and subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw sonication. The biotin maleimide-labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μm dithiothreitol to the samples. All samples were solubilized in 1% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and Western Blot analysis. A streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used for the specific reaction with biotin maleimide and a MelB-specific monoclonal antibody (21E4, Biocytex, Marseille, France), coupled directly to an alkaline phosphatase (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany), for the determination of the amount of protein. Both antibodies were used in a 1:1000 dilution. The alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate Kit (Bio-Rad) was used to visualize the bands on the membrane. The three acidic residues of loop 4–5 of MelB (Asp-137, Glu-140, and Glu-142) and the positively charged residues Arg-139 or Arg-141 (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were individually replaced by a cysteine using the Cys-less MelB sequence as genetic background. The Cys-less MelB served also as control throughout this study as its functional properties are similar to those reported for the wild-type MelB (15Weissborn A.C. Botfield M.C. Kuroda M. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Functional Properties of D137C, E140C, and E142—Initial characterization of D137C, E140C, and E142C MelB mutants included: 1) the measurement of the time course of melibiose accumulation in bacteria in the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of activating Na+ or Li+ (10 mm) and 2) the estimation of the expression level of the mutated transporter. Although initial rate and sugar accumulation at equilibrium in the presence of Na+ (10 min) by D137C or E140C cells were 0.9 or 0.45 times the values measured in Cys-less MelB, the level of E142C sugar accumulation was reduced by a factor of 10 (Fig. 1A). Similar to the wild-type, melibiose transport activity was stimulated by Na+ and Li+ both in the Cys-less mutant and in D137C, E140C, and E142C (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, the residual transport observed in E142C was completely abolished in the presence of 0.2 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), whereas that of D137C or E140C was not sensitive to the sulfhydryl reagent (data not shown). Comparison of the expression levels of Cys-less MelB and the mutants suggests that the reduced transport activity of D137C and E140C MelB can be satisfactorily accounted for by the reduction of the expression level of the two mutants (∼70 and ∼60% of Cys-less, respectively, not shown). In contrast, the permease content of E142C in membranes was proportionally too high (∼40%) to explain the large drop in cell transport activity. In view of these results, the E142C mutant was further characterized, and its properties were compared with those of the Cys-less and the R141C mutants. Measurement of sugar binding affinity in RSO membrane vesicles using the high affinity radiolabeled sugar analog α-[3H]NPG (4Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6893-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a ligand revealed that E142C retained the ability to bind the sugar in a Na+-dependent manner. However, the affinity for the sugar analog of E142C was lowered by a factor of 3–4 as compared with that of Cys-less MelB (apparent KD (Cys-less) = 0.6 μm, apparent KD (E142C) = 3.4 μm, data not shown). This drop in sugar affinity was similar to that observed in R141C (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Na+ activation constants for α-NPG binding (KNa) of E142C and Cys-less were comparable (both had a KNa of 0.32 mm, data not shown). Although NEM inhibited the residual transport in E142C, the sulfhydryl reagent added before or after addition of any substrate to the vesicles had no detectable effect on its sugar-binding properties (data not shown). On the other hand, NEM had no effect on the substrate binding or translocation properties of the Cys-less mutant (data not shown). The sugar translocation properties of MelB can be assessed by measuring entrance counterflow in de-energized RSO membrane vesicles (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The early transient influx of labeled substrate (overshoot) is tightly coupled to the downhill efflux of internal unlabeled sugar occurring when RSO membrane vesicles, pre-loaded with a sugar at high concentration, are diluted in a medium containing a lower sugar concentration (2Pourcher T. Bassilana M. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled sugar influx is primarily associated to shuttling of the loaded ternary complex (MelB-ion-sugar) across the membrane and does not include a contribution of the empty carrier. The peak of the transient uptake of [3H]melibiose observed after 1 min in Cys-less MelB was absent in E142C (Fig. 1B). Instead, the intravesicular level of radioactive melibiose in E142C steadily increased until a plateau value was reached. This influx of labeled sugar was significantly inhibited by NEM (data not shown). Summarizing, the defect of melibiose transport function of E142C included both a small reduction of sugar affinity and an impaired sugar translocation process. As will be further emphasized in the discussion, it is striking that mutagenesis of the neighboring E142C and R141C residues (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) gave rise to similar defects of the MelB translocation mechanism. It is finally worth mentioning that we isolated a second-site revertant of E142C with an additional mutation on I22S that is positioned on the inner half of helix I (E142C/I22S). Despite a permease expression level only slightly higher than that of E142C (∼50% versus ∼40%, respectively, data not shown), the revertant exhibited a Na+-stimulated melibiose transport activity five times higher than that of E142C (Fig. 1C) and a higher α-NPG affinity (apparent KD = 2.1 μm versus 3.4 μm, data not shown). The fact that a substitution of an apolar residue (isoleucine) by a polar residue (serine) located on helix I was able to compensate the loss of the negative charge at position 142 suggests first that helix I and loop 4–5 might be close to each other. Secondly, while this negative charge is not absolutely required, the need for a local polar environment at its level is important for the transport function and is party satisfied by introduction of the Ile to Ser mutation at position 22. Charge Translocation of R141C and E142C—Further insights into the R141C (17Abdel-Dayem M. Basquin C. Pourcher T. Cordat E. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1518-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and E142C defects were gained by comparing transient electrical currents recorded from liposomes containing purified mutated MelB, which were adsorbed onto the SSM and submitted to MelB co-substrate concentration jumps (5Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13744-13752Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the transient signals recorded from wild-type MelB containing proteoliposomes include either a single fast decaying component (in the range of 10 ms) or a combination of a fast and a slow decaying component (range of 100 ms) depending on the composition of the imposed substrate concentration jump (5Ganea C. Pourcher T. Leblanc G. Fendler K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13744-13752Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas the fast component was assigned to intraprotein charge transfers associated to or triggered by the binding of either co-substrate, th"

Recently we have shown that LIMK2 shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus in endothelial cells and that nuclear import is inhibited by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-283. Here we aimed to identify the structural features of LIMK2 responsible for nuclear import. We found that the kinase domain of LIMK2 is localized exclusively in the nucleus and, in contrast to the kinase domain of LIMK1, it accumulated in the nucleolus. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the basic amino acid-rich motif KKRTLRKNDRKKR (amino acids 491–503) as the functional nuclear and nucleolar localization signal of LIMK2. After fusing this motif to enhanced green fluorescent protein, the fusion protein localized exclusively in the nucleus and nucleolus. Mutagenesis studies showed that phosphorylation of Thr-494, a putative protein kinase C phosphorylation site identified within the nuclear localization signal, inhibits nuclear import of the enhanced green fluorescent protein-PDZ kinase domain of LIMK2. After inhibiting nuclear export with leptomycin B, phosphorylation of either Ser-283 or Thr-494 reduced the nuclear import of LIMK2. Phosphorylation of both Ser-283 and Thr-494 sites inhibited nuclear import completely. Our findings identify a unique basic amino acid-rich motif (amino acids 491–503) in LIMK2 which is not present in LIMK1 that serves to target the protein not only to the nucleus but also to the nucleolus.

Endothelial cell structure and functional integrity are important in the maintenance of the vessel wall and circulatory function. Contraction, migration, and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells control vascular permeability, endothelial repair after injury, and angiogenesis (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol.

The LIM kinases (LIMKs), 2The abbreviations used are: LIMK, LIM kinase; aa, amino acids; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PDZK, EGFP-PDZ kinase domain construct of LIMK2; NES, nuclear export signal; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NoLS, nucleolar localization signal; LIM domain, acronyms for lim, isl, mec domain; LMB, leptomycin B; PDZ, PSD-95, disc large, ZO-1; PKC, protein kinase C; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. consisting of LIMK1 and LIMK2, are serine/threonine protein kinases that regulate the actin dynamics via phosphorylating the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin (3Arber S.

Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Besides this, various studies showed that LIMKs may have a function in the nucleus (5Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22093-22102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1315-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The phenotype of LIMK2 knock-out mouse showed a defect in spermatogenesis, suggesting a nuclear function of tLIMK2, a testis-specific LIMK2 splice form lacking both LIM domains and being preferentially localized in the nucleus (7Takahashi H. Koshimizu U. Miyazaki J. Nakamura T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the nuclear localization of LIMKs can mediate suppression of Rac/Cdc42-mediated cyclin D1 expression. This effect of LIMKs was independent of cofilin phosphorylation and the regulation of actin dynamics (8Roovers K. Klein E.A. Castagnino P. Assoian R.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 273-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). LIMK1 and LIMK2 are localized predominantly in the cytoplasm but accumulate in the nucleus when the cells are treated with the chromosomal region maintenance 1-dependent export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB), suggesting that these kinases contain nuclear localization signals (NLS) (9Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NLSs are often characterized by clusters of basic amino acids. The main types of NLS known are monopartite and bipartite NLSs (11Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). The classical monopartite NLS is composed of a single cluster of basic amino acids such as SV40 large T-antigen NLS (PKKKRKV). The bipartite NLS comprises two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10–12-amino acid spacer such as the NLS of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKKLDK) (11Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar, 12Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of LIMKs has a unique basic amino acid-rich motif between subdomains VII and VIII (13Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1605-1612PubMed Google Scholar). The basic nature of this motif suggests that it may function as a NLS (9Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, LIMK1 has two nuclear export signal (NES) sequences within the PDZ domain (14Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These structural features suggest that LIMKs can actively shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, the NLS and NES of LIMK2 have not been characterized. We have recently shown that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of LIMK2 in endothelial cells is regulated by PKC activation. We could demonstrate that Ser-283 phosphorylation of LIMK2 by PKC inhibits its nuclear import (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified a unique basic amino acid-rich motif (491–503) in LIMK2 that is not present in LIMK1. Interestingly this motif of LIMK2 served to target the EGFP protein not only to the nucleus but also to the nucleolus. Phosphorylation of Thr-494 within this motif reduced the nuclear import of LIMK2, and phosphorylation of both Ser-283 and Thr-494 inhibited the nuclear import of LIMK2 completely. Materials—LMB was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Construction of the Expression Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pUC-SRα-LIMK2 vector containing full-length cDNA of LIMK2 was kindly provided by Prof. K. Mizuno (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). The full-length coding sequence of LIMK2 was amplified by PCR using pUC-SRα-LIMK2 as a template. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (B D Biosciences Clontech) to obtain LIMK2 fused with EGFP. The full-length cDNA of LIMK1 was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool of human umbilical vein endothelial cell total RNA. The following constructs of LIMK2 and LIMK1 were cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector: EGFP-NLS (aa 475–510) EGFP-PDZ kinase (aa 142–638, PDZK) and kinase domain (aa 315–638) of LIMK2, and kinase domain (aa 302–647) of LIMK1. The mutants of pEGFP-PDZ kinase and pEGFP kinase were generated by QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Agowa GmbH Berlin, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained and cultured as described previously (15Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6029) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harvested from umbilical cords were plated onto collagen-coated (room temperature, 75 μg/ml collagen G; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) plastic culture flasks and were cultured in complete endothelial growth medium (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. In all experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells up to the third passage were used. Transient transfection of endothelial cells was performed by electroporation as previously described (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown up to 90% confluency, harvested by trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) treatment, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (1.4 × 106 cells/400 μl) were resuspended in electroporation buffer (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.0). Plasmids (20 μg in 30–60 μl of electroporation buffer) were mixed with the cell suspension, and cells were incubated for 10 min (room temperature) then transferred into a 4-mm-gap electroporation cuvette for electroporation at 1000 microfarads and 210 V (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser). Thereafter, 400 μl of complete endothelial growth medium (without antibiotics) was added in the cuvette. Cells were then transferred to collagen-coated glass-bottom Petri dishes that are designed for confocal microscopy (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and grown in fresh complete endothelial growth medium for 24 h (washing and replenishment after 1 and 12 h). The transfection efficiency was 30–60%. Confocal Microscopy—After 24 h of transfection, cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. In some experiments cells were treated with LMB (10 ng/ml) for 60 min to inhibit chromosomal region maintenance 1-mediated nuclear export. Cells were kept under the microscope at 37 °C. An argon laser (488 nm) was used as a light source for EGFP excitation. The microscope function was controlled by a light manager through the software LSM 510 META. For Z-stacking, the top and the bottom position were selected, and 8–15 slices were determined according to the pinhole size and scanning time. The area and the mean intensity of the EGFP were measured using the LSM 510 META software. The measurements were carried out in three independent experiments with 20 cells randomly selected in each experiment. The mean ± S.E. was calculated for each experiment. Prediction of Nuclear Localization Signals in LIMK2—Our previous study showed that the deletion of both LIM domains of LIMK2 but not LIMK1 enhanced the nuclear accumulation of the truncated protein (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data indicate that LIMK2 localized more efficiently to the nucleus perhaps due to the differences in the NLS compared with LIMK1. Both LIMK1 and LIMK2 have a unique basic amino acid-rich region in the kinase domain. LIMK2 has a second basic amino acid-rich motif between the PDZ and the kinase domains (Fig. 1A). To predict the functional NLS in LIMK2, the basic amino acid-rich motifs of LIMK2 were analyzed by searching the Prosite data base and by manual comparison with the known NLSs of different proteins (Fig. 1, B and C, and Ref. 16Hulo N. Sigrist C.J.A. Le Saux V. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Bordoli L. Gattiker A. De Castro E. Bucher P. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 134-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four unique potential NLSs were predicted in LIMK2, which were designated as NLS1, NLS2, NLS3, and NLS4 (Fig. 1D), whereas only one monopartite NLS was found in LIMK1 (Fig. 1B). The monopartite NLS1 in LIMK2 and the NLS of LIMK1 were predicted by comparing these motifs with well characterized monopartite NLSs of different proteins (see Fig. 1B and Ref. 17Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). NLS3 of LIMK2, a classical bipartite NLS, was predicted by searching the Prosite data base (Fig. 1D). The bipartite NLS2 was unraveled by aligning the Polo-like kinases with the basic amino acid motifs of LIMK2 (18Taniguchi E. Toyoshima-Morimoto F. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48884-48888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to NLS3, NLS2 has a short spacer sequence of only 6-amino acids between two clusters of basic amino acids (Fig. 1C). Of interest, within the 6-amino acid spacer of NLS2, two further basic amino acids (RK) are present. NLS4 was predicted as a NLS due to a cluster of five basic amino acids. Beside four NLSs, two NESs were predicted in LIMK2 based on alignment with LIMK1 and the consensus sequence of NES (ψX2–3ψX2–3LX(L/I)), where ψ represents any hydrophobic amino acid). LIMK1 has two leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES1and NES2) in the PDZ domain (9Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The putative NES1 of the LIMK2 is present at the C terminus of PDZ domain, and NES2 is localized immediately after the PDZ domain (supplemental Table 1). The Kinase Domain of LIMK2 Localizes to the Nucleus and the Nucleolus—EGFP-PDZ kinase of LIMK2 (EGFP-PDZK) contains all the predicted NESs and NLSs. Indeed, we have previously shown that PDZ kinase of LIMK2 (amino acids 142–638) was localized both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of LIMK2 containing three predicted NLSs but no NES should localize mainly in the nucleus. To verify this prediction, the kinase domain (amino acids 315–638) fused with EGFP was transfected into endothelial cells. It was found that more than 95% of EGFP kinase accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). EGFP alone accumulated only to 42% in the nucleus (data not shown). Notably, EGFP kinase was also concentrated as dense bodies in the nucleus (white arrow, Fig. 2A), indicating that EGFP kinase might associate with specific nuclear subcompartments, such as the nucleolus, the cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles. Of these subcompartments, the nucleolus is a highly dense nuclear compartment that can be easily detected by phase contrast microscopy. Phase contrast images of EGFP kinase-transfected endothelial cells showed an exact overlap of nucleoli with intensely stained EGFP kinase dense bodies (Fig. 2A, arrowhead), indicating that the EGFP kinase of LIMK2 not only accumulates in the nucleus but also in the nucleolus. In contrast, EGFP kinase of LIMK1 did not localize to the nucleolus (Fig. 2A, arrows and arrowheads). These results suggest that the kinase domain of LIMK2, but not LIMK1, has a specific nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). Identification of Nucleolar and Nuclear Localization Signals of LIMK2 by Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Kinase Domain—NoLS are sequences mostly rich in arginine and lysine. They often overlap with NLSs. No specific consensus sequences for nucleolar localization have been determined (19Rowland R.R.R. Yoo D. Virus Res. 2003; 95: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Timmers A.C.J. Stuger R. Schaap P.J. van't Riet J. Raue H.A.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of various basic amino acid-rich stretches in the kinase domain of LIMK2 (aa 480–503) for nucleolar and nuclear localization, different mutants of EGFP kinase were generated in which the basic amino acids were mutated to alanines. The subcellular localization of the EGFP kinase mutants was then studied in endothelial cells. The mutants generated are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Positions of mutation in EGFP-kinase and EGFP-PDZK constructs of LIMK2 Mutant 1 (NLS1, RKKR, aa 500–503), mutant 2 (RK, aa 496–497), mutant 3 (KKR, aa 491–493), and mutant 4 (RKR, amino acids 480–482) were mainly localized in the nucleus similar to the wild type kinase domain of LIMK2. However, the nucleolus staining was drastically reduced (Fig. 2B, Table 2). These results indicate that NLS1 (RKKR) and the basic amino acid clusters RK and KKR are important parts of the NoLS. In contrast, the nucleolar localization of mutant 4 was only slightly reduced (Fig. 2B, g and h). These results indicate that each of the basic amino acid-rich clusters within the motif 491–503 (KKRTL-RKNDRKKR) is required for nucleolar localization but not for nuclear localization. The basic amino acids 480–482 play only a minor role in nucleolar localization.TABLE 2Summary of the mutation data of EGFP-kinaseName of the mutantSub-cellular localizationNucleusN versus CNucleolus% of totalWild type EGFP-kinase95 ± 2N>>>>CYesMutant 185 ± 4N>>>>CNoMutant 280 ± 6N>>>>CNoMutant 380 ± 6N>>>>CNoMutant 490 ± 1N>>>>CYesMutant 575 ± 2N>>>CNoMutant 675 ± 1N>>>CNoMutant 775 ± 5N>>>CNoMutant 820 ± 4N<<<CNo Open table in a new tab The nuclear localization of the double mutants, mutant 5 (RK and RKKR), mutant 6 (NLS2, KKR, and RKKR), and mutant 7 (NLS 3, RKR, and KKR) was decreased by only 25%. These mutants were also absent in the nucleolus (Fig. 2B, Table 2). When all the basic amino acids within the motif (aa 491–503) were mutated to alanines (mutant 8), the nuclear localization of EGFP kinase was drastically reduced (Table 2; 20 ± 4%), and its nucleolar localization was absent. These results indicate that NLS2 containing the basic amino acids RK within the spacer region (amino acids 491–503) is the NLS of LIMK2. NLS4 Is Not a Functional Nuclear Localization Signal—To explore whether NLS4 between the PDZ and the kinase domains can function as a nuclear localization signal, the kinase domain-deleted LIMK2 construct (EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2; aa 1–314) was prepared. The EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2 protein was localized in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. The two putative chromosomal region maintenance 1-dependent NESs of LIMK2 present in the EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2 (supplemental Table 1) may be responsible for its localization in the cytoplasm. To inhibit the NES functions, cells were treated with LMB. After 1 h of treatment, EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2 protein was distributed equally in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting a partial role of NLS4 for nuclear localization (Fig. 3A). To analyze further, the basic amino acids 280–282 (RRR) were mutated to alanine in EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2. The subcellular distribution of the mutant protein was, however, similar to that of the wild type construct in cells after LMB treatment (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that NLS4 is not functional. After LMB treatment, the presence of the EGFP-Δkinase-LIMK2 protein in the nucleus might be explained by the passive diffusion of this low molecular weight protein (60 kDa) into the nucleus. Analysis of the NLS by Site-directed Mutagenesis of the PDZK Domain of LIMK2—In comparison with the lower molecular mass EGFP kinase (∼62 kDa) protein, the EGFP-PDZK (∼84 kDa) is expected to be less in the nucleus, since it is unlikely to be transported into the nucleus by passive diffusion and contains two putative NESs. To analyze whether the NLS motif identified in the kinase domain (aa 491–503) is also sufficient for nuclear localization of EGFP-PDZK of LIMK2, selected mutants were studied (Table 1). EGFP-PDZK was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In 25% of the cells, nucleolar staining was observed. All the mutants of EGFP-PDZK were mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Table 3 and Fig. 3B). After LMB treatment, nuclear localization of mutant 9 (affecting NLS1) and mutant 11 (affecting NLS2) was only 20% (Fig. 3B, Table 3) indicating that amino acids 491–493 (KKR) and 500–503 (RKKR) are the major parts of the functional NLS. Nuclear localization of mutant 10 (affecting RK, 496–497) was higher (40%) than of mutants 9 and 11 (Fig. 3B, Table 3), indicating that these two basic amino acids are also a part of the NLS of LIMK2. When all the basic amino acids of the identified NLS (Mutant 12) were mutated to alanine, the mutant protein was exclusively in the cytoplasm (98%; Fig. 3B, Table 3), further supporting that the identified NLS motif (aa 491–503) is the nuclear localization signal of LIMK2. None of the mutants was observed in the nucleolus, indicating that all the basic amino acids of the motif (491–503) are required for the nucleolar localization of LIMK2.TABLE 3Summary of the mutation data of EGFP-PDZKName of the mutantSub-cellular localizationNucleusNucleolusControl+LMB% of totalWild type EGFP-PDZK40 ± 5100YesMutant 92 ± 220 ± 5NoMutant 102 ± 240 ± 6NoMutant 112 ± 220 ± 5NoMutant 122 ± 27 ± 3No Open table in a new tab The NLS of LIMK2 Is Sufficient to Translocate EGFP into the Nucleus and Nucleolus—To determine whether the identified NLS motif could transport EGFP in the nucleus and nucleolus, the amino acid sequence 475–510 of LIMK2 was fused to the C terminus of EGFP. The new fusion protein (EGFP-NLS) was completely localized to the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 3C), proving that the identified motif is the functional NLS and NoLS of LIMK2. Phosphorylation of Thr-494 Reduces Nuclear Import of LIMK—One putative PKC phosphorylation site (Thr-494) is present within the identified NLS, and it might affect the nuclear import after phosphorylation. When we studied the phospho-mimicking mutant of PDZK-LIMK2 (T494EE) in endothelial cells, we found that this mutant was exclusively present in the cytoplasm of resting endothelial cells (Fig. 4A). After LMB treatment, the mutant protein was partially enriched in the nucleus but was still less as compared with the wild type PDZK of LIMK2 (compare Fig. 4A with Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Thr-494 phosphorylation inhibits the NLS function of LIMK2; however, it is insufficient to block nuclear import completely. Phosphorylation of Ser-283 Together with Thr-494 Phosphorylation Inhibits Nuclear Import Completely—Previously we have shown that the PKC-dependent phosphorylation of LIMK2 at Ser-283 inhibited nuclear import, but the S283EE mutant protein still could enter the nucleus after LMB treatment (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We asked whether the phosphorylation of the two PKC sites can block the nuclear import completely. To answer this question, we prepared several double mutants of EGFP-PDZK of LIMK2. After LMB treatment, S283EE/T494A (active/inactive) mutant and S283A/T494EE (inactive/active) mutant behaved similar to the single active mutants S283EE and T494EE, respectively; they were partially enriched in the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B) (10Goyal P. Pandey D. Behring A. Siess W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27569-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The double active mutant (S283EE/T494EE) of EGFP-PDZK and EGFP-LIMK2 were localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and were unable to localize in the nucleus of endothelial cells after LMB treatment (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that phosphorylation of either one of the two PKC sites is not sufficient to inhibit the nuclear import completely and that phosphorylation of both sites is required to block the nuclear import of LIMK2 completely. In this study we describe two important structural features of LIMK2 that regulate its nuclear import; we identified the motif 491KKRTLRKNDRKKR503 as NLS as well as NoLS, and we found a putative PKC phosphorylation site within this motif (Thr-494) that partially inhibits nuclear import of LIMK2 in endothelial cells. We showed that the function of this motif was to target proteins not only to the nucleus but also to the nucleolus; fusion of a short stretch of amino acids containing this motif with EGFP lead to the localization of EGFP into the nucleus and nucleolus. Of note, our mutagenesis studies showed that the 4th basic amino acid cluster (aa 480–482) was not important in targeting the kinase and PDZ kinase domain of LIMK2 to the nucleus and nucleolus. Also, another possible NLS (NLS4) between the PDZ and kinase domains of LIMK2 was not functional. We have identified a putative PKC phosphorylation site (Thr-494) within the NLS of LIMK2 that inhibits nuclear import. Many nucleocytoplasmic erol shuttling proteins such as diacylglyc-kinase ζ, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and cyclin B1 are phosphorylated near their NLS, thereby affecting their affinity to the importin protein complex (17Jans D.A.

Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that PKC activation inhibits nuclear import of LIMK2 by phosphorylating the kinase at Ser-283. Our present data indicate that Ser-283 and Thr-494 phosphorylation cooperate in inhibiting the nuclear import of LIMK2. The identified functional NLS is not a classical monopartite and bipartite NLS. Unlike the classical bipartite NLS consisting of a defined spacer of 8–10 non-basic amino acids between two clusters of basic amino acids, the NLS and NoLS of LIMK2 is made of three clusters of basic amino acids. In contrast to LIMK2, LIMK1 has only an 8-amino acid (499–506) motif with two clusters of basic amino acids, suggesting different functions of the NLS of LIMK1 and LIMK2. Indeed, the kinase domain of LIMK2 but not LIMK1 was present in the nucleolus. Unlike the nucleus, there is no evidence for the existence of a barrier separating the nucleolus from the surrounding nucleoplasm. As a consequence, any soluble molecule should in principle diffuse in and out of the nucleolar compartment. Sequence analysis of nucleolar proteins did not lead to the identification of a general NoLS (25Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K.L. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr.

J. 2003; 376: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nucleolar localizing properties of proteins were apparently due to cooperation of several domains, suggesting a complex regulation of nucleolar localization (28Russo G. Ricciardelli G. Pietropaolo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5229-5235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Schmidt-Zachmann M. Nigg E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, small NoLS sequence motifs have been identified mainly in retroviral RNA binding trans-regulator proteins. Aligning the LIMK2 NoLS with the published NoLS sequences (generally 20–40 amino acids long) (30Kubota S. Copeland T.D. Pomerantz R.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1503-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Guo Y.X. Dallmann K. Kwang J. Virology. 2003; 306: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Horke S. Reumann K. Schweizer M. Will H. Heise T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26563-26570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that all these sequences retain continuous stretches of basic residues; either one continuous stretch of three to four basic residues or one to three stretches of three to four basic residues interrupted by one non-basic residue (Table 4). However, each of these basic amino acids clusters was shown to be important but not sufficient for nucleolar localization of the protein (30Kubota S. Copeland T.D. Pomerantz R.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1503-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Guo Y.X. Dallmann K. Kwang J. Virology. 2003; 306: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We also found by site-directed mutagenesis that each of the basic amino acid clusters (aa 491–503) was important for nucleolar localization of the kinase domain of LIMK2. Moreover, we could demonstrate that the sequence containing all three clusters of basic amino acids was sufficient to target EGFP to the nucleolus. Thus, this sequence functions as a NoLS.TABLE 4Alignment of NoLS sequencesProteinSequenceWerner, 1027-1058FLVEVSRYNKFMKICALTKKGRNWLHKANTESNucleolin, 691-714FRGGRGGGGGGGDFKPQGKKTKFRLa, 323-354QESLNKWKSKGRRFKGKGKGNKAAQPGSGKGKL5, 240-271YKKAHAAIRENPVYEKKPKKEVKKKRWNRPKMIGF-I, 161-195GTEASLQIRGKKKEQRREIGSRNAECRNAECRGKKGKHIV-1 Rev, 35-50RQARRNRRRRWRERQRHTLV-I Rex; 2-19PKRTRRRPRRSQRKRPPTPLIMK2, 491-503KKRTLRKNDRKKR Open table in a new tab Targeting of the LIMK2 to the nucleolus might be accomplished by one of three different types of interactions; (a) with nucleolar or nucleolar-associated proteins and (b) with rDNA and (c) nucleolar RNA consisting mainly of rRNA (33Shaw P.J.

These proteins have a similar pattern of basic amino acid distribution as in LIMK2, suggesting that LIMK2 may bind to rRNA (Table 5). The binding of proteins to rRNA in the nucleolus is known to regulate ribosome biogenesis necessary for cell division and gene transcription (27Leung A.K. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Biochem.

Whether the nuclear and nucleolar function of LIMK2 involves its interaction with actin and cofilin remains to be explored. Recent studies showed that actin and associated proteins are found in various sub-compartments of the nucleus such as the nucleolus and speckles (40Pederson T. Aebi U. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2022213109,"In Arabidopsis, oxidation of the large (46-kDa) isoform activase to form a disulfide bond in the C-terminal extension (C-extension) significantly increases its ADP sensitivity for both ATP hydrolysis and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activation, thereby decreasing both activities at physiological ratios of ADP/ATP. In this study, we demonstrate that the C-extension of the oxidized large activase isoform can be cross-linked with regions containing residues that contribute to the nucleotide-binding pocket, with a higher efficiency in the presence of ADP or the absence of nucleotides than with ATP. Coupled with measurements demonstrating a redox-dependent protease sensitivity of the C-extension and a lower ATP or adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) affinity of the oxidized large isoform than either the reduced form or the smaller isoform, the results suggest that the C-extension plays an inhibitory role in ATP hydrolysis, regulated by redox changes. In contrast, the ADP affinities of the small isoform and the reduced or oxidized large isoform were similar, which indicates that the C-extension selectively interferes with the proper binding of ATP, possibly by interfering with the coordination of the γ-phosphate. Furthermore, replacement of conserved, negatively charged residues (Asp390, Glu394, and Asp401) in the C-extension with alanine significantly reduced the sensitivities of the mutants to ADP inhibition, which suggests the involvement of electrostatic interactions between them and positively charged residues in or near the nucleotide-binding pocket.

Several residues in Box VII, which is part of the linkage between the Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 motifs, are essential for maintaining a functional enzyme. Two conserved arginine residues in this region (Arg237 and Arg240 in Arabidopsis) may act as “arginine fingers” to interact with (or sense the presence of) the γ-phosphate group of ATP bound to an adjacent subunit and induce a conformational change necessary for subsequent ATP hydrolysis (9Li C.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by the involvement of a nearby tryptophan (Trp246 in Arabidopsis) in an ATP-induced increase in the intrinsic fluorescence of activase (12Wang D. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 88: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although Rubisco activation requires ATP hydrolysis activity by activase, ATP hydrolysis does not require the presence of Rubisco, and the rate of hydrolysis is not tightly coupled to Rubisco activation (1Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2003; 75: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To avoid unregulated ATP hydrolysis by the activase, most plants (like Arabidopsis) have two isoforms of activase, and the large isoform appears to tightly regulate ATP hydrolysis of both isoforms at physiological ADP/ATP ratios via thioredoxin-mediated redox changes (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 14Zhang N. Kallis R.P. Ewy R.G. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The two isoforms in Arabidopsis and other plants (e.g. spinach, barley, rice, and cotton) differ only at the C terminus (15Werneke J.M. Chatfield J.M. Ogren W.L. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Rundle S.J. Zielinski R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4677-4685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17To K.Y.

The activities of the oxidized large isoform are more sensitive to ADP inhibition than those of the small isoform, and this sensitivity is decreased when the large isoform is reduced. Two cysteines (Cys392 and Cys411) in the C-terminal extension (C-extension) are required for redox regulation of activase at physiological ADP/ATP ratios in vitro (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and the capacity for down-regulation of Rubisco under the limiting light in vivo (14Zhang N. Kallis R.P. Ewy R.G. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Increased self-association of activase increases its activity (20Salvucci M.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Wang Z.Y. Ramage R.T. Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Lilley R.M. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is typical of many AAA+ proteins that typically function in an oligomeric ring structure. A connection between redox regulation of activase and monomer-oligomer exchange was proposed, based on the fact that the altered sensitivity to the ADP/ATP ratio of the large isoform via redox treatments is sufficient to regulate the activities of both isoforms when mixed at a 1:1 ratio, although the activity of the smaller isoform itself is not altered by redox treatments (23Zhang N. Schürmann P. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, an effort to better understand the subunit interactions of activase was made by using mutants containing an introduced cysteine(s) near the N and/or C terminus of the small isoform of cotton activase and homobifunctional sulfhydryl-reactive cross-linkers (24Salvucci M.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The N and C termini of the small isoform, which is 40 amino acids shorter than the large isoform in cotton, were shown to be in close proximity. Moreover, cross-linking of the mutants enhanced their activity. However, no cross-linking was observed between the mutants and the wild type large isoform (24Salvucci M.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several key photosynthetic enzymes in the chloroplast stroma besides activase are regulated by thioredoxin (25Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Google Scholar), and the molecular basis for regulation is provided by their structures. However, due to the lack of structural information for activase, the molecular details of how the C-extension confers redox regulation of its activity remain unclear. A hypothetical model (23Zhang N. Schürmann P. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) proposes that oxidation of a disulfide bond between Cys392 and Cys411 causes a conformational change in the C-extension that allows docking near or into the ATP-binding site(s) and thus hinders the proper binding of ATP. Here we provide support for this hypothesis by studies of the effects of site-directed mutagenesis of several negatively charged residues in the C-extension, redox-dependent changes in proteolytic sensitivity of this region, and cross-linking/peptide mapping. Materials—1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid and N-((2-pyridyldithio)-ethyl)-4-azido salicylamide (PEAS) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Biotinyl-iodoacetamidyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamine (biotin_PEO) and immobilized, monomeric avidin-agarose were obtained from Pierce. ATPγS was obtained from Roche Applied Science. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinamic acid and biotin were purchased from Sigma. Sequencing-grade trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Thrombin was obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). C18 Zip-tips and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid insertion were performed using a cDNA clone of the large (46-kDa) isoform of Arabidopsis Rubisco activase and the QuikChange® kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Six single mutations and two double mutations at negatively charged residues were made: E390A, D394A, E398A, D401A, D407A, D408A, E390A/D401A, and D394A/E398A. A new cysteine residue was inserted at position 402 (C402INS). Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant activases and thioredoxin-f were expressed and purified as reported previously (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Salvucci M.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Isolation of native Rubisco was performed as reported previously (26Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activities—ATP hydrolysis activity of activase at different ADP/ATP ratios was determined by measuring the formation of inorganic phosphate from ATP as reported previously (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis in the absence of ADP was measured by coupling ADP production to NADH oxidation (26Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1348-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the presence of ADP, the single step Rubisco activation assay was performed as reported previously (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the absence of ADP, activation of the inactive Rubisco-RuBP complex by activase was measured by following 3-phosphoglyceric acid production in a coupled spectrophotometric assay (27Kallis R.P. Ewy R.G. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Total Rubisco activity was assayed after preincubation of the inactive Rubisco-RuBP complex with 15 mm NaHCO3 and 15 mm MgCl2 at room temperature for 15 min. Nucleotide Binding Assay—Estimations of nucleotide binding using measurements of fluorescence quenching with 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid were performed as reported previously (28Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Assays of binding using intrinsic fluorescence were performed as reported previously (21Wang Z.Y. Ramage R.T. Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Km for ATP hydrolysis of activase was estimated as described (27Kallis R.P. Ewy R.G. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 1077-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Limited Proteolysis—Redox treatments of the recombinant large (46-kDa) Arabidopsis activase were performed as reported previously (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Reduced or oxidized activase was incubated with thrombin (29Keil B. Specificity of Proteolysis. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1992: 335Google Scholar) at a ratio of 1/100 (w/w) in 50 mmHEPES and 20 mm KCl, pH 7.8. At each indicated time point, an aliquot of the hydrolysate was mixed with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled immediately, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. A 48-kDa control protein (Novagen) was used to examine the effect of reduction and oxidation conditions on the performance of thrombin. Chemical Cross-linking of the C402INS Mutant—The derivatization of activase with PEAS was performed as reported previously with some minor modifications (30Cai K. Itoh Y. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Pioszak A.A. Jiang P. Ninfa A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13450-13461Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The C402INS activase (2 mg/ml) was first incubated with 1 mm PEAS in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6) and 20 mmKCl at 4 °C in the dark for at least 2 h. For cross-linking in the presence of wild type small (43-kDa) isoform activase, the derivatized C402INS was first passed through a Sephadex G-50 spin column into reaction buffer to remove excess PEAS before mixing with an equal amount of the small isoform activase. The samples were then mixed with 4 mm MgCl2 only or 4 mm MgCl2 plus 0.2 mm nucleotides (ADP or ATP) for 15 min before being transferred onto a prechilled 96-well plate. Cross-linking was initiated with long wave UV light by placing a hand-held UV source (model UVL-21 Blak-Ray® lamp, Ultraviolet Products, San Gabriel, CA) directly onto the 96-well plate. UV exposure times were indicated. Peptide Derivatization and Purification—The steps for identification of peptides cross-linked with the C-extension were modified from previous reports (30Cai K. Itoh Y. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and are outlined in Fig. 5D. PEAS-derivatized and cross-linked C402INS activase (Steps 1 and 2) was desalted to remove excess cross-linker and denatured by incubation at 65 °C for 15 min. The newly exposed sulfhydryl (-SH) groups on activase were then derivatized with 4 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark (Step 3). To allow enrichment and facilitate the identification of SH-containing peptides from the large pool of tryptic peptides (see below), a further derivatization with biotin_PEO before trypsin digestion, followed by avidin-agarose affinity purification, was performed (Steps 4–7). First, the iodoacetamide-derivatized activase was incubated with 8 mm DTT to reduce the native disulfide bonds in activase and the disulfide bond formed by PEAS derivatization followed by desalting to remove excess DTT (Step 4). Then, the newly released -SH groups were immediately derivatized by incubation with 10 mm biotin_PEO in the dark at room temperature for 2 h (Step 5). After removing excess biotin_PEO by desalting into 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5), the samples were incubated with a sequencing grade trypsin modified by reductive methylation (Promega) at a 1:50 (w/w) ratio of protease/activase at 37 °C overnight (Step 6). To purify the biotin_PEO-derivatized peptides by avidin-agarose (Step 7), the beads (40 μl) were prepared first by incubating with biotin (1 mg/ml) to block the non-exchangeable biotin-binding sites. Then the agarose beads were washed with 20 bed volumes of 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.0) followed by an equilibration with 20 bed volumes of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The biotin_PEO-derivatized peptides were incubated with the equilibrated avidin-agarose at room temperature for 2 h. The beads were washed with 100 bed volumes of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the bound peptides on avidin-agarose were eluted with biotin (1 mg/ml). Four fractions (100 μl) were collected. To increase the elution efficiency, the agarose beads were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in between each fraction. Mass Spectrometry—Avidin-agarose purified tryptic fragments of Rubisco activase were first desalted on a high pressure liquid chromatography C18 reverse phase column (Vydac 218TP™) with H2O/ACN to remove biotin and salts. Mass analysis was performed by using MALDI-TOF (Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR) (see Fig. 5D, Step 8). Before the mass analysis, the peptide samples were further desalted using C18 Zip-Tips (Millipore). Purified peptides were then mixed with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinamic acid matrix solution (in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and subjected to mass spectrometry (Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Illinois). Mass spectra were taken by using the linear mode (30Cai K. Itoh Y. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Assay—Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against either spinach activase at dilution of 1:8000 or a synthesized 36-amino acid length of the C-terminal peptide (380–415; Fig. 1) of 46-kDa Arabidopsis activase at dilution of 1:4000. IRDye 700-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LICOR, Lincoln, NE) were used at dilution of 1:10,000 or 1:20,000 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Visualization was accomplished by scanning the membranes with a LICOR Odyssey infrared image system (LICOR, Lincoln, NE), and bands were quantified with the Odyssey V1.2 application software. Effects of Mutation of Negatively Charged Residues on the C-extension—Six negatively charged residues (Glu390, Asp394, Glu398, Asp401, Asp407, and Asp408) are highly conserved (except Glu398) and located near the two critical Cys residues (Cys392 and Cys411) on the C-extension of Arabidopsis 46-kDa isoform activase (Fig. 1). Alanine replacement of these negative residues was performed to examine their potential roles. Among the six single mutants, only E390A, D394A, and D401A exhibited ATP hydrolysis and Rubisco activation activities significantly higher than the recombinant wild type at an ADP/ATP ratio of 0.33 (data not shown). Two double mutants were then made to examine combined effects (Fig. 2, A and B). In the absence of ADP, the double mutants E390A/D401A and D394A/E398A had higher (2.3- and 1.8-fold, respectively) ATP hydrolysis and higher (2.2- and 1.7-fold, respectively) Rubisco activation activities than the wild type. At an ADP/ATP ratio of 0.33, a typical condition for the chloroplast stroma in the light, E390A/D401A was much less sensitive to ADP inhibition with 4.6-fold higher ATP hydrolysis and 6.6-fold higher Rubisco activation activities than the wild type. Replacement of D394A/E398A was less effective than E390A/D401A, resulting in 2.3-fold higher ATPase and 3.6-fold higher Rubisco activation activities than wild type at an ADP/ATP ratio of 0.33. It is possible that the lower ADP sensitivity of the mutants is mainly due to an altered redox potential of the nearby cysteines. Therefore, the equilibrium redox midpoint potentials (Em) for the ATP hydrolysis activity of the mutants E390A, D401A, and E390A/D401A were compared with the recombinant wild type enzyme at pH 7.9 as described previously (23Zhang N. Schürmann P. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The redox titrations were all fitted by the Nernst equation for a single, two-electron component, with midpoint potentials very close to that of wild type (data not shown). Nucleotide Binding by Rubisco Activase—Nucleotide binding by the recombinant wild type and mutant activase isoforms was compared by determining the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for ADP and ATPγS with 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid fluorescence quenching (11van de Loo F.J. Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8143-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Wang D. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2006; 88: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Wang Z.Y. Portis Jr., A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Binding of ATPγS was also determined by intrinsic fluorescence enhancement as a function of nucleotide concentration (22Lilley R.M. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Binding of ATP was estimated from the concentration dependence (Km) of ATP hydrolysis (22Lilley R.M. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After reduction by thioredoxin and DTT, the apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for ATPγS and Km of ATP hydrolysis of the large (46-kDa) isoform decreased to 60 and 40% of those of the oxidized form, respectively, and thus became more similar to those of the small (43-kDa) isoform (Table 1). The observed effects of redox on ATP binding were somewhat less but otherwise consistent with a previous report (23Zhang N. Schürmann P. Portis Jr., A.R. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Kd values for ADP of the small isoform and the reduced or oxidized large isoforms were all similar. These results indicate that redox modulation of the C-extension on the large isoform changes the affinity for ATP or its analog ATPγS but not ADP. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that a C-terminal Cys-to-Ala mutant (C411A), which cannot be redox-modulated (13Zhang N. Portis Jr., A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9438-9443Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), also has a higher affinity for ATP (or ATPγS) than the oxidized 46-kDa isoform. In addition, the double mutant (E390A/D401A) with decreased sensitivity to ADP inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B) also exhibited higher affinities for ATP and ATPγS than the oxidized wild type 46-kDa isoform, with values more similar to the reduced 46-kDa isoform (Table 1). These results clearly indicate that the proper binding of ATP, but not ADP, in the nucleotide-binding pocket is selectively impaired only when the C-extension is oxidized and has negatively charged residues that might allow specific interactions with other residues near the nucleotide-binding domain.TABLE 1The effects of redox changes and mutation on nucleotide binding capacities of wild type Rubisco activaseRubisco activaseANS fluorescenceIntrinsic fluorescence (Kd-ATPγS)ATP hydrolysis (Km)Kd-ADPKd-ATPγSμmμmμmμmRCA46ox3.2 ± 0.215 ± 0.611 ± 0.4135 ± 5RCA46red2.9 ± 0.19.3 ± 0.46.8 ± 0.354 ± 2C411A3.0 ± 0.29.1 ± 0.46.9 ± 0.358 ± 2E390A/D401A3.1 ± 0.29.4 ± 0.37.5 ± 0.379 ± 3RCA432.8 ± 0.17.4 ± 0.35.3 ± 0.228 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Sensitivity of C-extension to Proteolysis—To demonstrate that conformational changes of the C-extension occur after redox treatments, sensitivity to a site-specific protease, thrombin, was compared between the reduced and oxidized forms of wild type 46-kDa activase (Fig. 3, A and B). Thrombin has only one cleavage site at 372GRG374 (29Keil B. Specificity of Proteolysis. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1992: 335Google Scholar) (Fig. 1) in the C-extension of the large isoform. The C-extension of the oxidized 46-kDa isoform remained almost intact after incubation with thrombin for 2 min, whereas 30% of the reduced isoform was cleaved to a 43-kDa band. A similar difference in sensitivity was observed at longer times of exposure. Immunoblots using antibody specific for the C-extension peptide (Fig. 3A) or whole enzyme (Fig. 3B) confirmed that the 43-kDa bands correspond to a C terminus-truncated form of 46-kDa activase. The redox treatments had no effect on the proteolytic activity of thrombin as measured by using a 48-kDa control protein (data not shown). Cysteine Insertion Mutation—A new cysteine residue was inserted at position 402 (named C402INS) in the C-extension of the 46-kDa isoform to examine the proximity of this domain to other regions of activase by chemical cross-linking. This approach has some similarities to previous studies that used the smaller isoform and exploits the observation that the endogenous cysteine residues (outside of the C-extension) are not very reactive (7van de Loo F.J. Salvucci M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4621-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Salvucci M.E. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the absence of ADP, the C402INS mutant had ATP hydrolysis and Rubisco activation activities comparable with those of wild type 46-kDa activase (Table 2). The C402INS mutant exhibited a similar redox-dependent sensitivity to ADP as the wild type (Fig. 4). To examine whether the insertion mutation disturbs the formation of the disulfide bond between Cys392 and Cys411, the redox midpoint potential of"

Here we show that externalized calpains increase epithelial cell mobility and thus are critical for tubule repair. In vitro, exposure of human tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) to μ-calpain limited their adhesion to extracellular matrix and increased their mobility. Calpains acted primarily by promoting the cleavage of fibronectin, thus preventing fibronectin binding to the integrin αvβ3. Analyzing downstream integrin effects, we found that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway was activated in response to αvβ3 disengagement and was essential for calpain-mediated increase in HK-2 cell mobility. In a murine model of ischemic acute renal failure, injection of a fragment of calpastatin, which specifically blocked calpain activity in extracellular milieu, markedly delayed tubule repair, increasing functional and histological lesions after 24 and 48 h of reperfusion. These findings suggest that externalized calpains are critical for tubule repair process in acute renal failure.

Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). The major isozymes, calpain 1 or μ-calpain and calpain 2 or m-calpain, are distributed ubiquitously and activated in vitro by micromolar and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+, respectively. They are heterodimers composed of a ∼80-kDa catalytic subunit (encoded by CAPN1 and CAPN2 for μ- and m-calpain, respectively) and a common ∼30-kDa regulatory subunit (encoded by CAPN4). Binding of Ca2+ to μ- or m-calpain induces the release of constraints imposed by domain interactions and results in a two-stage activation process: first, the release of ∼30-kDa regulatory subunit; and second, the rearrangement of the active site cleft in ∼80-kDa catalytic subunit (2Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Calpain activity is tightly controlled by calpastatin, a specific endogenous inhibitor, which contains four equivalent inhibitory domains (1Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar). By conducting limited proteolysis of intracellular substrates, calpain activity has been shown to be critical for a great diversity of cellular responses. They include rearrangement of cytoskeletal linkages to the plasma membrane during cell adhesion and mobility, modification of molecules in signal transduction pathways, degradation of enzymes controlling the cell cycle, and activation of proteolytic cascades leading to cell apoptosis or necrosis (1Goll D.E.

Recently, several groups showed that calpains may be released from cells into the extracellular environment and thus may have an extracellular role. Like other intracellular enzymes, calpains may indeed leak out from injured and dying cells such as hepatocytes exposed to toxic chemicals (5Mehendale H.M. Limaye P.B. Trends Pharmacol.

In an extracellular Ca2+-rich environment, activated calpains trigger plasma membrane proteins of the neighboring cells and extracellular matrix proteins. The proximal straight tubule in the outer medulla of the kidney is particularly susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion injury, which remains the leading cause of acute renal failure (ARF) 3The abbreviations used are: ARF, acute renal failure; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; PKA, protein kinase A; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Damages to this segment are characterized initially by the disruption of tight junctions that control cell polarity (12Bush K.T. Keller S.H. Nigam S.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Sheridan A.M. Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The loss of cell polarity is responsible for the redistribution of integrin subunits from the basolateral to the apical membrane, contributing to the shedding of cells into the tubule lumen. With more sustained ischemia/reperfusion, epithelial cells of the proximal tubule undergo necrosis or apoptosis (14Padanilam B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F608-F627Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Calpains are considered as a key mediator of this death. Their activation results from both a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ through endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release (15Harriman J.F. Liu X.L. Aleo M.D. Machaca K. Schnellmann R.G. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and a caspase-dependent decrease in calpastatin activity (16Shi Y. Melnikov V.Y. Schrier R.W. Edelstein C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F509-F517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, calpains hydrolyze the cytoskeleton-associated paxillin, talin, and vinculin, thus contributing to increased plasma membrane permeability and cell death (17Liu X. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells that do not die participate in the regeneration of tubular epithelium and the restoration of renal function (11Bonventre J.V. Weinberg J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2199-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). They migrate into areas denuded by exfoliation, where they dedifferentiate, proliferate, and differentiate again (18Zuk A. Bonventre J.V. Brown D. Matlin K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C711-C731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because calpains leak out from dead tubular epithelial cells (19Liu X. Rainey J.J. Harriman J.F. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F728-F738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the question arises as to whether externalized calpains play a role in this repair process. Thus, our study has focused on exploring the effects of extracellular calpains on tubular epithelial cells. By using an in vitro approach, we demonstrated that extracellular calpains increased the mobility of tubular epithelial cells by promoting the cleavage of fibronectin, the disengagement of αvβ3 integrin, and thereby the activation of cyclic AMP signaling pathway. By using a model of ischemic ARF, we showed that extracellular calpains are indeed critical for tubule repair process. Materials—Human erythrocyte μ-calpain, human calpastatin peptide, calpastatin recombinant domain I, human placenta collagen IV, human fibroblast fibronectin, protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C, Akt inhibitor, and adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine were obtained from Calbiochem. Human plasma thrombin was from Roche Diagnostics. Human placenta laminin, human fibroblast metalloproteinase-9, and PKA inhibitor H-89 were obtained from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human laminin β-1 (D-9), fibronectin (EP5), integrins β1 (4B7R) or β3 (SAP), polyclonal antibodies against calnexin (H-70), collagen type IV (H-234), fibronectin (H-300), αV (P2W7), α3 (C-18), β1 (M-106) integrins, goat anti-rabbit IgG TRITC conjugate, and anti-mouse FITC conjugate antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human αvβ3 (LM609) and β1 (PAC10) integrins were obtained from Chemicon International. Cell Cultures—Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cell line; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere in a serum-free keratinocyte medium supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor and pituitary bovine extract (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with KRH medium (KCl 5 mm, NaCl 115 mm, KH2PO4 1 mm, MgSO4 1.2 mm, Hepes 25 mm, pH 7.4) supplemented with CaCl2 2mm, and HK-2 cells were exposed to μ-calpain or vehicle alone. Cell viability and cell proliferation were assessed by measuring the exclusion of trypan blue and the uptake of [3H]thymidine, respectively (20Leonard M.O. Cottell D.C. Godson C. Brady H.R. Taylor C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40296-40304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To assess the role of extracellular matrix proteins, multiwell slides were coated with human fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin (50 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were allowed to spread on coated wells, with or without blocking anti-αvβ3 antibody (15 μg/ml), for 24 h before exposure to calpain. Video Microscopy and Migration Assay—For video microscopy experiments, HK-2 cells were grown on chambered coverglass system (Lab-Tek®, Nunc) for 24 h before exposure to calpain. Sequential phase contrast images were taken by confocal microscopy at 10-s interval over 30-90 min using a Leica TCS laser scanning confocal microscope (Lasertechnik). Migration assays were performed using 8-μm pore Transwell inserts (Costar). HK-2 cells (100,000) were added to the upper chamber of inserts in a serum-free keratinocyte medium supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor and pituitary bovine extract. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with KRH medium supplemented with CaCl2 2 mm before HK-2 cells were exposed to μ-calpain and allowed to migrate from the upper to the lower chamber for 6 h at 37 °C. Then, cells remaining on the upper surface of the Transwell inserts were removed with an absorbent tip, and cells that had migrated on the lower side of the inserts were fixed with ethanol, stained using hematoxylin/eosin, and counted. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HK-2 cells were allowed to spread on chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nunc) for 24 h before exposure to μ-calpain. Immunofluorescence staining of actin cytoskeleton,β1,β3,αvβ3 integrins, and fibronectin was performed on cells fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min. Slides were incubated with appropriate dilutions of specific primary (1/200) and secondary (1/400) FITC- or TRITC-labeled antibodies. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS laser scanning confocal microscope (Lasertechnik). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation of αvβ3-fibronectin complexes, cell lysates were prepared by scraping HK-2 cells into an ice-cold protease inhibitory buffer. The lysate was centrifuged (4000 × g, 4 °C for 30 min). A portion of the supernatants was reserved for protein determination, and protein concentration in supernatant samples was adjusted with the protease inhibitory buffer. These samples (100 μl) were incubated for 20 h with A/G agarose coupled to anti-αvβ3 integrin antibody before the complexes were washed extensively and solubilized in SDS sample buffer with reduction. For Western blot analysis, proteins that had been immunoprecipitated or extracted from HK-2 cells, extracellular milieu of HK-2 cells, and mouse urine samples were separated by electro-phoresis on Novex BisTris 7.5% gels using XCell SureLock™ Mini-Cell (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) prior to detection of integrin or extracellular matrix protein with a specific primary antibody (dilution 1/200) and a peroxidase-labeled anti-IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1/4000). Thereafter, the membrane was developed with the ECL plus detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Image J software was used to analyze the density of the bands in arbitrary densitometry units. Calpain Assay—The calpain-like activity was determined in intact cells as described previously (21Bellocq A. Doublier S. Suberville S. Perez J. Escoubet B. Fouqueray B. Rodriguez Puyol D. Baud L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36891-36896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Determination of Intracellular Cyclic AMP Concentrations—HK-2 cells were exposed to μ-calpain in KRH medium supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. After 10 min, cyclic AMP was extracted with an ice-cold ethanol/formic acid mixture (85:5, v/v) and quantified using a radioimmunoassay ([125I]cAMP assay, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Values were normalized to the protein concentration using a Bradford procedure and expressed as fmol/μg protein. Induction of Ischemic Acute Renal Failure—The studies were conducted by following established guidelines for animal care, and all protocols were approved by the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale. C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of avertin (Sigma) and subjected to bilateral flank incisions as described previously (22Letavernier E. Perez J. Joye E. Bellocq A. Fouqueray B. Haymann J.-P. Heudes D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Baud L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Both renal pedicles were cross-clamped for 25 min. This time was chosen to obtain a reproducible acute renal failure, while minimizing animal mortality. After clamp removal, the kidneys were inspected for restoration of blood flow, the surgical wounds were sutured, and animals were allowed to recover. Finally, to maintain fluid balance and volume status, mice were given 0.5 ml of warm saline intraperitoneally. After 24, 48, or 72 h of reperfusion, they were reanesthetized, blood and urine samples were collected, and kidneys were removed for morphological analyses. Assessment of Renal Function and Histology—Samples of serum were collected from all the mice to measure both creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) using an autoanalyzer. For light microscopy, kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for paraffin embedding. Sections of 3-μm thickness were made and stained with Masson trichromic solution. Tubular injury was scored by estimating the percentage of tubules in the cortex or the outer medulla that showed epithelial necrosis or had luminal necrotic debris and tubular dilatation as follows: 0, none; 1, <10%; 2, 10-25%; 3, 25-50%; 4, 50-75%, and 5, >75%) (22Letavernier E. Perez J. Joye E. Bellocq A. Fouqueray B. Haymann J.-P. Heudes D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Baud L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All evaluations were made on 10 fields/section and 10 sections/kidney by two different blinded observers. For fluorescence microscopy, cryostat sections of frozen kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were stained with primary anti-fibronectin (1/100) and secondary TRITC-labeled (1/400) antibodies and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, a nuclear stain. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between groups of values were made with the Student's t test for unrelated groups. A difference between groups of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Extracellular μ-Calpain Modulates the Behavior of Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells—To assess initially the impact of extracellular calpains on tubular epithelial cell viability, proliferation, and morphology, we exposed HK-2 cells to purified μ-calpain. Concentrations of μ-calpain ranged between 0.1 and 2 μg/ml, as such concentrations are reached in the extracellular medium of activated cells (6Deshpande R.V. Goust J.-M. Chakrabarti A.K. Barbosa E. Hogan E.L. Banik N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, μ-calpain did not affect HK-2 cell viability and growth, as judged by trypan blue exclusion and [3H]thymidine uptake, respectively (Fig. 1A). By contrast, exposure of HK-2 cells to μ-calpain resulted in a marked alteration of their morphology. Within 30 min, they adopted a more rounded morphology and migrated before aggregating into heaps scattered over the monolayer (Fig. 1B and Video 1). An assay using chemotaxis chambers demonstrated further that extracellular μ-calpain promoted HK-2 cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The response to μ-calpain was specific because 1) the addition of a serine protease (thrombin up to 10 units/ml) or a matrix metalloprotease-9 up to 2 μg/ml had no effect on HK-2 cell morphology and migration; and 2) the addition of cell-impermeable calpastatin (5 μg/ml) completely prevented the response to μ-calpain (data not shown). Because cell migration requires a redistribution of integrin-cytoskeleton linkages, we analyzed both the organization of actin cytoskeleton and the expression of integrins (Fig. 1D). The most important integrins in the proximal tubule are α3β1, α6β1, and αvβ3 (23Paller M.S. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: S52-S55PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells, the actin cytoskeleton was characterized by randomly oriented cytoplasmic stress fibers, and the β1 integrin was expressed at basolateral membrane and in a large intracellular pool, where it colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin (Fig. 1E). After μ-calpain addition to the culture medium, actin bundles were reinforced at the cell periphery, and β1 integrin molecules were redistributed from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Similar results were shown by analyzing β3 integrin (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that extracellular μ-calpain induces cell migration and that this effect is associated with a redistribution of integrin-cytoskeleton linkages. Extracellular μ-Calpain Targets Fibronectin in Extracellular Matrix of Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells—Intracellular calpain activity is involved in the redistribution of integrin-cytoskeleton linkages during cell migration (24Huttenlocher A. Palecek S.P. Lu Q. Zhang W. Mellgren R.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Ginsberg M.H. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32719-32722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thus, we considered initially the possibility that extracellular μ-calpain enters the cells and/or affects intracellular calpain activity. In fact, measurements of calpain activity showed that μ-calpain, being added to the extracellular medium either continuously or transiently, did not affect calpain activity of HK-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Further, pre-exposure of HK-2 cells to cell-permeable calpastatin peptide (5 μg/ml) did not affect their response to extracellular calpain (data not shown), excluding again a role for intracellular calpain activity. Because integrins are a known substrate for calpains (3Glading A. Lauffenburger D.A. Wells A. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 46-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we next examined whether extracellular μ-calpain would affect HK-2 cell spreading and mobility by cleaving the extracellular domain of integrins. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts established that HK-2 cells express α3, αv, β1, and β3 integrin subunits (Fig. 2B). Exposure of these cells to μ-calpain did not result in any detectable integrin cleavage. Thus, we finally examined whether integrin ligands in the extracellular matrix would be a preferential target for extracellular μ-calpain. To this aim, HK-2 cells were cultured on surfaces coated with or without definite extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin, laminin, and collagen type IV (Fig. 2C). After 24 h of culture, HK-2 cells attached equally to either surface. Interestingly, cells attached to fibronectin adopted a more rounded morphology and migrated in response to μ-calpain exposure, whereas cells attached to laminin or collagen type IV did not. These data suggested that in our experimental conditions, fibronectin was a major substrate for μ-calpain. Western blot analysis confirmed this hypothesis. In the extracellular milieu of HK-2 cells exposed to μ-calpain both the monoclonal and the polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibodies reacted mainly with a fibronectin fragment of ∼140 kDa (Fig. 2D). This breakdown product of 250-kDa fibronectin was undetectable in the extracellular milieu of control HK-2 cells. By comparison, collagen type IV was not released, and laminin β-1 was released without cleavage in the extracellular milieu of both control and μ-calpain-treated HK-2 cells (data not shown). Thus, fibronectin would be the main target of μ-calpain in extracellular matrix in vivo, other targets such as proteoglycans (8Fushimi K. Nakashima S. Banno Y. Akaike A. Takigawa M. Shimizu K. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: 895-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) not being excluded. Fibronectin Cleavage by Extracellular μ-Calpain Is Responsible for the Disengagement of αvβ3 Integrin—The αvβ3 integrin is the main fibronectin receptor in proximal tubular epithelial cells (25Goligorsky M.S. Lieberthal W. Racusen L. Simon E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1-F8PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether fibronectin cleavage interfered with fibronectin binding to αvβ3, fibronectin-αvβ3 complexes were analyzed by both immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the presence of fibronectin-αvβ3 complexes in HK-2 cells, which was limited significantly upon cell exposure to μ-calpain (Fig. 3A). Double immunolabeling of HK-2 cells showed that αvβ3 localized mainly to basolateral membrane, in close contact with fibronectin fibrils in extracellular matrix (Fig. 3B). Exposure of HK-2 cells to μ-calpain resulted initially in a marked fragmentation of fibronectin fibrils and later on in a notable accumulation of fibronectin in the cytoplasm, whereas αvβ3 was still expressed at the basolateral membrane (Fig. 3B). Thus, these results suggest the disappearance of fibronectin-αvβ3 complexes in HK-2 cells exposed to μ-calpain. To determine further the involvement of αvβ3 integrin in response to μ-calpain, HK-2 cells were cultured in the presence of anti-αvβ3 blocking antibody. Anti-αvβ3-treated cells attached less to extracellular matrix and showed no morphology change upon exposure to μ-calpain, i.e. no migration and aggregation into heaps (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that fibronectin cleavage by μ-calpain is responsible for αvβ3 disengagement, which is essential to modify HK-2 cell spreading and mobility. Unligated αvβ3 Integrin Induces PKA-dependent Mobility of Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells—Integrin ligation is a potent regulator of PKA, and in turn, PKA pathway regulates actin-based migration of cells (26DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 27Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), including tubular epithelial cells (28Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Li X. Li H.-P. Amsler K. Hyink D. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9260-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the cyclic AMP/PKA pathway would become activated following calpain-dependent disengagement of αvβ3 and was involved in HK-2 cell migration. Fig. 4A shows that exposure of HK-2 cells to μ-calpain for 10 min produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. Blocking cyclic AMP accumulation and PKA activity by using the cell-permeable adenylyl cyclase inhibitor 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (data not shown) and the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 4B and Video 2), respectively, completely prevented μ-calpain-induced HK-2 cell migration. By contrast, H-89 did not prevent μ-calpain-dependent fibronectin cleavage (Fig. 4C). This response was specific, as blocking PKB/Akt and protein kinase C activities by using 1-L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate and calphostin C, respectively, was ineffective in preventing μ-calpain-induced HK-2 cell migration (data not shown). Our results indicate that αvβ3 binding to fibronectin would suppress PKA activity in HK-2 cells, and conversely, αvβ3 disengagement would restore this activity, thereby inducing cell migration. Externalized Calpains Play a Role in Tubular Repair after Renal Ischemia—Tubular epithelial cell migration is an essential feature of tubular repair. Indeed, epithelial cells surviving ischemia migrate over denuded areas of basement membrane before proliferating to replace lost cells (30Nony P.A. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because we demonstrated in vitro the role of extracellular calpains in tubular epithelial cell migration, we investigated in vivo their involvement in tubular repair after renal ischemia. To this aim, calpastatin domain I, a very specific non-cell-permeable calpain inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally to mice, just after induction of ischemic ARF. This small macromolecule (14-kDa molecular mass) would cross the glomerular capillary wall readily and thus reach the tubular lumen. In vehicle-treated mice subjected to bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 25 min, serum creatinine levels increased after 24 h of reperfusion, stabilized at 48 h, and decreased progressively thereafter (Fig. 5A). BUN demonstrated a similar pattern. In mice given calpastatin, the ischemia/reperfusion-dependent rise in serum creatinine and BUN was more severe and markedly prolonged (Fig. 5A). Remarkably, this worsening of renal dysfunction was associated with a significant increase in tubular injury (including necrosis, tubular dilation, and sloughing of epithelial cells) in the cortex and the outer medulla as assessed by semiquantitative analysis (Fig. 5B). Extracellular μ-calpain degraded fibronectin in extracellular matrix of HK-2 cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, we next examined whether calpastatin administration would prevent fibronectin degradation by externalized calpains in postischemic kidney. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated a faint fibronectin staining at the basal surface of tubular epithelial cells after 24 and 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 6A). There was a marked increase in this staining in mice given calpastatin. Fibronectin was not detectable by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis in urine of control mice (Fig. 6B). After 24 h of reperfusion, a ∼30-kDa fibronectin fragment became detectable, suggesting a release of the ∼140-kDa fibronectin fragment from tubule extracellular matrix and its subsequent degradation by proteases in the urinary tract. Densitometric analysis showed that this expression decreased significantly in mice given calpastatin (8.2 ± 1.5 versus 19.5 ± 3.7 densitometry units, p < 0.05, n = 7). Therefore, externalized calpains seem to play a key role in kidney repair after an ischemic insult. This protective effect is accompanied by a degradation of extracellular matrix fibronectin. Here, we have provided evidence that μ-calpain released from necrotic epithelial cells in ARF would play an essential role in tubule repair. Specifically, in vitro exposure of tubular epithelial cells to extracellular μ-calpain reduced their adhesion to fibronectin in extracellular matrix and thereby increased their mobility, which was critical to repair. Effective concentrations of calpain (∼1 μm) were presumably reached in the fluid of proximal tubules 24 h after induction of ischemic ARF, as estimated by measuring calpain activity in urine and taking tubule fluid concentration process along the nephron into account (∼4 μm). One of the hallmarks of ischemic ARF is tubular cell necrosis, a damage leading to calpain externalization. Previous studies have demonstrated that externalized calpains cleave extracellular proteins, including the latent form of transforming growth factor-β (31Abe M. Oda N. Sato Y. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 174: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the extracellular matrix components, vitronectin and fibronectin (32Seiffert D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11170-11176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33Dourdin N. Brustis J.-J. Balcerzak D. Elamrani N. Poussard S. Cottin P. Ducastaing A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Consistent with this latter report, we found that extracellular μ-calpain hydrolyzes fibronectin. In the kidney, fibronectin is localized in interstitial matrix, being secreted in particular by proximal tubular epithelial cells. As a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury, interstitial matrix proteins such as fibronectin are exposed (18Zuk A. Bonventre J.V. Brown D. Matlin K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C711-C731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus become a new substrate for externalized calpains. Our data indicate that fibronectin hydrolysis by μ-calpain results in the appearance of fibronectin breakdown products in the extracellular milieu both in vitro and in vivo. This process could help explain the observation that immunoreactive fibronectin is abundantly expressed in tubular lumen 3-24 h postischemia (18Zuk A. Bonventre J.V. Brown D. Matlin K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C711-C731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the size of fibronectin break-down products by Western blot analysis. Both the monoclonal and the polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibodies reacted mainly with a fragment of ∼140 kDa (Fig. 2D). Because the polyclonal antibody is directed against the COOH terminus of fibronectin molecule, the ∼140-kDa fragment contains this domain and thus results from the cleavage of fibronectin molecule at a site located between type III domains 7 and 10. This region is involved in interaction with several integrins (e.g. αvβ3) (34Adair B.D. Xiong J.-P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) so that its proteolytic cleavage would impede fibronectin binding to such integrins. In the kidney, fibronectin interacts with αvβ3 and weakly or not with α3β1 at the surface of proximal tubular epithelial cells (25Goligorsky M.S. Lieberthal W. Racusen L. Simon E.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F1-F8PubMed Google Scholar, 35Glynne P.A. Picot J. Evans T.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2370-2383PubMed Google Scholar). We indeed found a direct interaction of fibronectin with αvβ3 integrin by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization experiments. This binding was markedly reduced in HK-2 cells exposed to μ-calpain, providing strong evidence for the hypothesis that fibronectin degradation by extracellular calpains causes αvβ3 disengagement. A recent work by Akimov et al. (36Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) reported that tissue transglutaminase interacts directly with fibronectin in extracellular matrix and αvβ3 integrin on the cell surface, thereby potentiating integrin-mediated cell adhesion and outside-in signal transduction. As calpains are known to cleave tissue transglutaminase (37Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), they could regulate αvβ3 downstream signaling by hydrolyzing tissue transglutaminase in addition to fibronectin. Integrin ligation activates downstream signaling pathways that are involved in the control of cell migration. We found that αvβ3 disengagement in response to fibronectin hydrolysis activates cyclic AMP signaling pathway. Similarly, recent studies in endothelial cells have demonstrated that impeding α5β1 binding to extracellular matrix ligand activates PKA (38Kim S. Bakre M. Yin H. Varner J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby integrin αvβ3 disengagement activates cyclic AMP signaling pathway are unknown. The increase in cyclic AMP resulted probably from the activation of adenylyl cyclase, given that our measurements were performed in the presence of the phospho-diesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Furthermore, there have been reports that αvβ3 integrin and integrin-associated protein (CD47) may combine to form a functional seven-transmembrane complex, which associates with Gi protein and, once activated, decreases cyclic AMP (39McDonald J.F. Zheleznyak A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17301-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, αvβ3-CD47-Gi complexes could be involved in the control of adenylyl cyclase activity by αvβ3 engagement/disengagement. However, further work is needed to assess the precise role of these complexes in the cell response to extracellular calpain. Cyclic AMP signaling pathway is known to exert both negative and positive effects on cell migration (27Howe A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The current observation that αvβ3 disengagement is associated with the accumulation of cyclic AMP in HK-2 cells and that inhibiting cyclic AMP signaling pathway impedes HK-2 cell migration provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that cyclic AMP signaling pathway plays a role in stimulating cell mobility in response to extracellular μ-calpain. Previous studies have also demonstrated that cyclic AMP signaling pathway stimulates tubular epithelial cell migration in vitro (28Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Li X. Li H.-P. Amsler K. Hyink D. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9260-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclic AMP signaling pathway has been implicated in the protection of these cells against the cytotoxic effect of ischemia and intracellular ATP depletion (40Lee H.T. Emala C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F844-F852Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because adenosine is released from injured or dying cells and induces both cyclic AMP-dependent survival and migration of tubular epithelial cells (28Kartha S. Toback F.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Li X. Li H.-P. Amsler K. Hyink D. Wilson P.D. Burrow C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9260-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there are at least two potential mechanisms (i.e. calpain externalization and adenosine release) whereby necrosis of epithelial cells could speed up repair of tubules in ARF. In the present study, the concept that externalized calpains may accelerate tubule repair in ischemic ARF is supported by the demonstration of persistent lesions of tubules after administration of calpastatin domain I. The decreased level of fibronectin breakdown product in urine of mice given calpastatin indicates clearly that calpastatin reached tubule lumens and effectively targeted externalized calpains. By contrast, a recent report shows that two cell-permeable calpain inhibitors, PD 150606 and E-64, reduce the renal dysfunction and injury caused by ischemia reperfusion (41Chatterjee P.K. Todorovic Z. Sivarajah A. Mota-Filipe H. Brown P.A. Stewart K.N. Mazzon E. Cuzzocrea S. Thiemermann C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Altogether, this is good evidence that extracellular calpains triggered by calpastatin domain I contribute to tubule repair, partly by inducing epithelial cell migration, whereas intracellular calpains triggered by PD 150606 and E-64 participate in tubule injury, partly by increasing oxidative stress. To our knowledge, only one other study has examined the role of externalized calpains in repair process. Mehendale and Limaye (5Mehendale H.M. Limaye P.B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that calpains released from necrotic hepatocytes hydrolyze proteins in the plasma membrane of neighboring cells, leading to progression of injury rather than to repair. One hypothesis to explain the differences between this result and the present study is that calpain concentrations reached in the extracellular milieu would be markedly higher in liver exposed to acute toxic insult than in ischemic kidney. The major conclusion of our work is that calpains released from necrotic cells in ischemic ARF trigger repair process. This effect is likely secondary to fibronectin cleavage, αvβ3 integrin disengagement, and cyclic AMP signaling pathway activation. Thus, our study highlights the importance of extracellular calpains and intracellular cyclic AMP as targets for therapeutic intervention in ARF. It also proposes a novel evidence that necrotic cells may directly trigger the tissue repair response. We thank Philippe Fontanges for help with the confocal microscopy."

Here we have characterized the domain structure of β protein in the presence and absence of DNA using limited proteolysis. Residues 1–130 form an N-terminal “core” domain that is resistant to proteases in the absence of DNA, residues 131–177 form a central region with enhanced resistance to proteases upon DNA complex formation, and the C-terminal residues 178–261 of β protein are sensitive to proteases in both the presence and absence of DNA. We probed the DNA binding regions of β protein further using biotinylation of lysine residues and mass spectrometry. Several lysine residues within the first 177 residues of β protein are protected from biotinylation in the DNA complex, whereas none of the lysine residues in the C-terminal portion are protected. The results lead to a model for the domain structure and DNA binding of β protein in which a stable N-terminal core and a more flexible central domain come together to bind DNA, whereas a C-terminal tail remains disordered. A fragment consisting of residues 1–177 of β protein maintains normal binding to sequentially added complementary oligonucleotides and has significantly enhanced binding to single-strand DNA. β protein from bacteriophage λ promotes a single-strand annealing reaction that is central to Red-mediated recombination at double-strand DNA breaks and chromosomal ends. β protein binds most tightly to an intermediate of annealing formed by the sequential addition of two complementary oligonucleotides.

The Red system of bacteriophage λ consists of three proteins that promote DNA recombination initiated at dsDNA 4The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy.4The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy. breaks or at the overlapping ends of the linear λ chromosome (1Poteete A.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 201: 9-14PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuzminov A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 28: 49-70Google Scholar). The exo gene (redα) encodes λ exonuclease, a 24-kDa protein with 5′-3′ exonuclease activity (3Little J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 679-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Carter D.M. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2502-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bet gene (redβ) encodes the 29-kDa β protein, which binds ssDNA and promotes annealing of complementary strands (5Kmiec E. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12636-12639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Muniyappa K. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7472-7478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gam gene encodes the 16-kDa γ protein, which binds and inhibits host nuclease enzymes (7Marsic N. Roje S. Stojiljkovic I. Salaj-Smic E. Trgovcevic Z. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4738-4743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kulkarni S.K. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1989; 123: 249-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the three proteins promote recombination events that enhance the replication and repair of phage λ DNA within the Escherichia coli host. Certain strains of E. coli contain an analogous recombination system, RecET, encoded on a cryptic rac prophage, that is turned on to promote recombination in certain genetic backgrounds (9Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-Deluca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). RecE and RecT are functionally analogous and related in sequence to λ exonuclease and β protein, respectively (10Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3417-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the RecET and Redαβ systems have in recent years been employed in novel and powerful methods for genetic engineering (12Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Court D.L. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 13Muyrers J.P.P. Zhang Y. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1986; 261: 7472-7478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and annealing of shorter oligonucleotides (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The protein binds weakly to ssDNA of minimal length of about 36 nucleotides with a site size of approximately one monomer per five nucleotides (15Mythili E. Kumar K.A. Muniyappa K. Gene. 1996; 182: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). β protein does not bind directly to dsDNA but remains tightly associated with the duplex product of annealing formed by the sequential addition of two complementary oligonucleotides to β protein (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although β protein is not an ATPase, it will promote some RecA-like strand exchange and invasion reactions in vitro but only when certain restrictive criteria are met, such as high A/T composition (16Li Z. Karakousis G. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 733-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Rybalchenko N. Golub E.I. Baoyuan B. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17056-17060Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The structure of β protein has been studied by electron microscopy (18Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4279-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the presence of Mg2+, the protein alone forms rings of ∼12 subunits, slightly larger rings (15–18 subunits) in the presence of ssDNA, and left-handed helical filaments in the presence of dsDNA or two complementary strands of ssDNA. A model was proposed in which ssDNA binds to the outer surface of the rings formed by β protein in such a way that the bases are exposed and available for interactions with a second strand of ssDNA, which may be bound by a separate ring of β protein. Initiation of annealing likely nucleates formation of a β protein filament, which coats the duplex product of annealing. Presumably the strongly favorable interaction of β protein with the newly formed dsDNA drives the reaction in favor of annealing.β belongs to a family of proteins (10Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) including RecT, for which there is no representative crystal structure. β protein and RecT, the best-studied members of this family, share only about 15% sequence identity with one another. Secondary structure prediction based on a multiple sequence alignment suggests four α-helices and five β-strands for a conserved region corresponding to residues 19–205 of β protein (10Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Notable features in the sequences include several conserved aromatic and apolar residues and two consecutive highly conserved acidic residues near the end of the conserved region. Beyond the low resolution electron microscopy studies and what can be gleaned from sequence analyses, very little is known about the structure of β protein.Here we have used limited proteolysis, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry to probe the domain structure of β protein in the presence and absence of DNA. The results reveal a protease-resistant N-terminal core domain, a central region that is stabilized by DNA complex formation, and a flexible C-terminal tail. In addition, application of a recently developed technique for mapping out protein-DNA interactions, which involves biotinylation of lysine residues and mass spectrometry (19Shell S.M. Hess S. Kvaratskhelia M. Zou Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Kvaratskhelia M. Miller J.T. Budihas S.R. Pannell L.K Le Grice S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15988-15993Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), suggests that both the N-terminal and central regions of β protein, but not the C-terminal tail, are involved in binding to DNA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of β Protein—The bet gene encoding β protein was PCR-amplified from phage λ genomic DNA (New England Biolabs) and cloned into pET-14b (Novagen) between the NdeI and BamH1 sites. The primers for PCR amplification were 5′-G GAA TTC CAT ATG AGT ACT GCA CTC GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA TGC TGC CAC CTT CTG C-3′ (reverse). The resulting plasmid expresses β protein with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. The integrity of the insert was verified by DNA sequencing, and the plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli cells. Cell cultures (6 × 1 liter) were grown in Luria broth at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and shaken at 18 °C for an additional 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the pellets were stored at –80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed and re-suspended in 50 ml of buffer A (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 100 μg/ml α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. After sonication the lysate was centrifuged at 39,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 10-ml column of Ni2+-loaded chelating Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer A containing 30 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient from 30–500 mm imidazole in buffer A. Pooled fractions containing β protein were dialyzed into thrombin cleavage buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with 50 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) at 22 °C for ∼24 h. The protein was then loaded onto the Ni2+ column and the flow-through was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, loaded onto a 25-ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, concentrated to 47 mg/ml, and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. The concentration of β protein was determined by absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.02 m NaH2PO4, pH 6.5, using an extinction coefficient of 34,850 m–1 cm–1, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar). The final protein contains the extra N-terminal sequence Gly-Ser-His. The K253A mutant of β protein was generating using the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene), and the protein was purified as described above for wild type.Expression and Purification of β Protein Fragments—Regions of DNA encoding amino acids 1–177 and 1–188 of β protein were PCR-amplified from phage λ genomic DNA and cloned into pET-9a between the NdeI and BamH1 sites. PCR used the forward primer listed above and the reverse primers 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA ACG TTC TGC AGT GTA TGC-3′ (β1–188) and CGC GGA TCC TCA GCG CTC GGC TTC ATC CTT GTC (β1–177). The K11A, K36A, K69A, and K172A mutants of the β1–188 fragment were generated by the QuikChange procedure. Plasmids were transformed into BL21-AI E. coli cells (Invitrogen), grown in 1-liter cultures of Luria broth at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5, induced with 0.2% arabinose, and shaken at 15 °C for an additional 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at –80 °C.For purification of β1–188 protein, cells were thawed and resuspended in 35 ml of buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) supplemented with lysozyme and protease inhibitors as described above. After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 39,000 × g, and the supernatant was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, loaded onto a 25-ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column, and eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, loaded onto a 25-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.5 m NaCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, concentrated to 66 mg/ml, and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots.For purification of β1–177, thawed cells were re-suspended in buffer B. After sonication and centrifugation of the cell lysate, polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the resulting suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the protein from the supernatant was further purified by anion exchange and heparin chromatography as described above for β1–188 except that 100 mm NaCl was included in the buffer before the heparin column. Purification of β1–188 proteins with the K11A, K36A, K69A, and K172A mutations followed this same procedure, except the heparin chromatography step was omitted, and the final buffer included 100 mm NaCl.Oligonucleotides—Two complementary 33-mer oligonucleotides, 33+ (ACA GCA CCA GAT TCA GCA ATT AAG CTC TAA GCC) and 33– (GGC TTA GAG CTT AAT TGC TGA ATC TGG TGC TGT), which are derived from a sequence present in M13 phage DNA (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by ion exchange HPLC. Oligonucleotide concentrations were determined from absorbance at 260 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from their sequences and are expressed in nucleotides. 33+ oligonucleotide was 32P-5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and free nucleotides were removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences).DNA Binding Assays—The gel shift assay to measure binding of β protein to sequentially added oligonucleotides is based on a published protocol (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Each 20-μl reaction contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 32P-end-labeled 33+ and β protein of the indicated concentrations were incubated at 37 °C, and after 10 min the complementary oligonucleotide (33–) of the indicated concentration was added, and the reaction was incubated an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (20% glycerol, 0.12% bromphenol blue, 0.12% xylene cyanol), each sample was loaded onto a 15% native polyacrylamide gel (5% stacking gel) and electrophoresed in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) buffer at room temperature. Dried gels were autoradiographed.Binding of full-length β protein and the β1–177 fragment to a 33-mer oligonucleotide (33+) was measured using a double-filter method (22Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Binding reactions (50 μl) were in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and contained ∼100 nm 32P-end-labeled 33+ oligonucleotide and 0–1 mm protein. The reactions were equilibrated at 37 °C for 30 min and then loaded onto a Minifold I 48-well slot-blot apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) containing nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and DEAE (Whatman) filters. Samples were pulled through the filters under vacuum and washed with 1 ml of buffer C. The radioactivity on the filters was measured using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage of protein-bound DNA was calculated from the intensities on the nitrocellulose (protein-bound) and DEAE (unbound) filters.Limited Proteolysis—Limited trypsin digestions were performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm CaCl2, and 60 mm KCl at 25 °C. The reactions contained 2.5 mg/ml (86 μm) β protein in the absence or presence of 250 μm each of sequentially added 33+ and 33– oligonucleotides, as described above. Trypsin was added to a final concentration of 5 ng/μl, and 10 μl of the reaction was removed at the indicated times. Reactions were quenched with 10 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed on a 13.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. Digestions using the same procedure were also done with 50 ng/μl chymotrypsin, 10 ng/μl subtilisin, and 25 ng/μl thermolysin. For mass spectrometric analysis of limited proteolysis products, reactions were incubated for 30 min, quenched by adding 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and injected directly onto the LC-MS instrument.For N-terminal sequencing, unstained SDS-PAGE gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. Individual bands were cut out of the gel and sequenced by automated Edman degradation (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) using an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise HT sequencer. Data analysis was performed with Applied Biosystems model 610A software. Standard reagents and conditions were employed.Biotinylation Reactions—12 μl of 2.5 μg/μl β protein or β protein-DNA complex was prepared as described above. 38 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) and 2.5 μl of 40 mm NHS-biotin (Pierce) dissolved in Me2SO were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 40 min, and the reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 100 mm lysine (8.7 mm final concentration). The biotinylated protein was subjected to complete trypsin digestion as has been described (23Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 511-521Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was precipitated from the reaction mixture by adding acetone, and the pellet was washed with acetone and dried. The pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of 8 m urea, 0.4 m NH4HCO3, reduced with 5 μl 45 mm DTT, and alkylated with 5 μl of 100 mm iodoacetic acid. 50 μl of double-distilled H2O was then added to dilute the digestion buffer to 2 m urea, 0.1 m NH4HCO3. 5 μl of 0.2 μg/μl trypsin in 1% acetic acid was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The trypsin digestion was stopped by adding 10 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid. A 10-μl aliquot of the mixture was then subjected to LC-MS analysis.Mass Spectrometry—All mass spectrometric analyses used a ThermoFinnigan LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer coupled with a Surveyor HPLC system (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA). For mass spectrometry of limited proteolysis reactions, HPLC separations were performed with a PLRP-S column (8 μm, 1000 Å, 1.0 × 150 mm, Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) and a Vydas C4 guard column using H O/acetonitrile gradients at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. 0.1% formic 2acid and 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid were included in both water and acetonitrile. The data were collected in positive ion mode with full scan ranging from 400–2000.For mass spectrometry of trypsin digests of biotinylation reactions, collection of all MS and MS/MS data used a C18 column (Vydas, 1.0-mm inner diameter × 250 mm long, 5-μm particles, and 300 Å pore size; Hesperia, CA) with Vydas C18 guard column. In the survey run the mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode and cycled through a single MS and five MS/MS experiments. MS/MS experiments (collision energy 35%) were performed on the five most abundant ions (3-Da window; precursor m/z ± 1.5 Da) in each full scan mass spectrum. MS/MS spectra were matched to amino acid sequences from β protein using SEQUEST with differential modification of 226.3 Da to lysine and a static modification of 57 Da to cysteine. Once the unbiotinylated and biotinylated peaks were assigned to individual peptides, the retention time and best response charge states were recorded. The mass spectrometer was then switched to full scan ion mode with the scan range of 400–1500. When signal responses of analytes were compared, chromatographic peak area was used. The doubly charged peak of “VGMDSVDPQELITTLR” (16–31)2+ was selected as internal loading control, since this peptide fragment is not affected by biotinylation and is always formed by tryptic digestion. All other peptide responses were normalized to the response of this peptide.RESULTSLimited Proteolysis of β Protein Alone and in Complex with DNA—We first verified that our preparation of β protein, which has the extra N-terminal residues GSH, has the expected DNA binding properties. In the assay (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), β protein is first incubated with a 32P-end-labeled 33-mer (33+) oligonucleotide, and as the complementary oligonucleotide (33-) is titrated in, the resulting β protein-DNA complex is shifted to the top of a 15% polyacrylamide gel (supplemental Fig. S1). Binding of β protein to only one oligonucleotide (lane 3) or to pre-annealed duplex 33-mer (not shown) is not observed. Thus, as has been concluded previously (14Karakousis G. Ye N. Li Z. Chiu S.K. Reddy G. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a tight complex is formed only when the two complementary oligonucleotides are added sequentially to β protein. As seen by electron microscopy, this preparation of β protein also forms rings and filaments in the presence of heat-denatured dsDNA (data not shown) that appear very similar to those reported for native β protein (18Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4279-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The domain structure of β protein both alone and in complex with DNA was investigated using limited proteolysis with trypsin. In the absence of DNA, β protein is rapidly digested into a distinct fragment that appears as a ∼15-kDa band on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1). N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometric analysis of this cleavage product unambiguously identified it to be residues 1–134 of β protein. In complex with annealed duplex DNA (as prepared in Fig. S1, panel A, lane 8), parts of β protein are significantly protected from trypsin digestion. In particular, three new distinct cleavage products are observed as ∼19-, 21-, and 27-kDa bands, which correspond to residues 16–177, 1–177, and 1–230 of β protein, respectively. The fragment of residues 1–177 is the most stable and persists for greater than 2 h.In addition to stabilizing larger fragments of β protein, DNA complex formation also stabilizes the N-terminal domain (residues 1–134) since it persists for 120 min in the presence of DNA but is completely digested within 120 min in the absence of DNA. DNA does not stabilize full-length β protein, since the upper band disappears at the same rate in both the presence and absence of DNA. Mass spectrometric analysis reveals that the upper band from the samples digested in the presence of DNA does not actually correspond to full-length β protein but rather to residues 1–253 that result from removal of residues 254–261 by trypsin cleavage at Lys-253.The single-strand annealing activity and oligomeric properties of β protein have previously been shown to be sensitive to Mg2+ ions (5Kmiec E. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12636-12639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mythili E. Kumar K.A. Muniyappa K. Gene. 1996; 182: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4279-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the limited trypsin digestion patterns in both the presence and absence of DNA are not affected at all by the omission of Mg2+ from the reaction (data not shown). In addition, essentially the same results seen in Fig. 1 are observed when the buffer is the same as that used for the gel-shift assay of Fig. S1, which does not contain Mg2+ or other divalent cations.Limited proteolysis of β protein was also investigated using chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and thermolysin (Figs. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). Although in general chymotrypsin cleaves at sites very different from trypsin (after aromatic or aliphatic residues instead of basic residues), the two give very similar cleavage patterns for β protein; that is, a stable N-terminal domain (residues 1–131) in the absence of DNA and a larger series of fragments (residues 1–184, 9–184, 13–184, and 36–184) in the presence of DNA. With subtilisin, a non-sequence-specific protease, β protein alone is digested into two similar fragments, an N-terminal domain (residues 1–134) and a longer fragment (residues 1–184), which in this case persists even in the absence of DNA. DNA does, however, change the cleavage pattern such that several new fragments (residues 1–177, 13–182, 20–182) are observed. Similarly with thermolysin, which cleaves before apolar residues, N-terminal (residues 1–138) and longer (1–177) fragments are observed for the protein alone, whereas DNA shifts the pattern to a series of intermediate fragments (residues 1–177, 8–177, and 12–177). Interestingly, with thermolysin a fragment consisting of nearly full-length β-protein (residues 1–258) is significantly more stable in the absence of DNA than in its presence, indicating that some sites within β protein are more accessible in the DNA complex than in the free protein.We have also investigated the trypsin digestion of β protein preparations that give distinct oligomeric forms (rings and filaments) as seen by electron microscopy (18Passy S.I. Yu X. Li Z. Radding C.M. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4279-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the small ring preparation with Mg2+ in the absence of DNA, only the N-terminal core domain (residues 1–134) is observed. For the large ring preparation in the presence of a 33-mer oligonucleotide, a small amount of the fragment corresponding to residues 1–177 is also observed. For the filament preparation formed in the presence of a heat-denatured fragment of ΦX174 dsDNA, increased amounts of full-length and fragments corresponding to residues 1–177 and 1–230 are observed, and the pattern is similar to that of the DNA complex with sequentially added 33-mer oligonucleotides described above. This analysis is consistent with the notion that in the DNA complex formed with sequentially added complementary oligonucleotides, β protein likely exists as short filaments. Using size-exclusion chromatography on Superdex S-200, our preparation of β protein in the absence of DNA elutes as a distinct peak corresponding to a large oligomer (566 kDa or ∼19 subunits), consistent with a ring (data not shown). The complex with sequentially added oligonucleotides elutes as a distinct peak with a larger apparent size. Similarly, with native acrylamide gel electrophoresis the complex of β protein with sequentially added oligonucleotides forms a distinct band that is of lower mobility (presumably larger size) than several bands formed by β protein alone (data not shown).Probing the DNA Binding Regions of β Protein by Biotin Modification and Mass Spectrometry—To further probe the structure of β protein and its interactions with DNA, we used a method involving mass spectrometric analysis of protein modified by biotinylation at lysine residues. NHS-biotin reacts efficiently and specifically with the primary ϵ-amino group of lysine side chains to become covalently attached via a stable amide linkage. The modification alters the pattern of pep"

With the recently proposed global allostery model, this question acquires crucial significance, because it relates tertiary conformational changes to effector binding in both the R- and T-states. In this context, an important question is how far the induced conformational changes propagate from the binding site(s) of the allosteric effectors. We present a study in which we monitored the interdimeric interface when the effectors such as Cl–, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, inositol hexaphosphate, and bezafibrate were bound. We studied oxy-Hb and a hybrid form (αFeO2)2-(βZn)2 as the T-state analogue by monitoring heme absorption and Trp intrinsic fluorescence under hydrostatic pressure. We observed a pressure-dependent change in the intrinsic fluorescence, which we attribute to a pressure-induced tetramer to dimer transition with characteristic pressures in the 70–200-megapascal range. The transition is sensitive to the binding of allosteric effectors. We fitted the data with a simple model for the tetramer-dimer transition and determined the dissociation constants at atmospheric pressure. In the R-state, we observed a stabilizing effect by the allosteric effectors, although in the T-analogue a stronger destabilizing effect was seen. The order of efficiency was the same in both states, but with the opposite trend as inositol hexaphosphate > 2,3-diphosphoglycerate > Cl–. We detected intrinsic fluorescence from bound bezafibrate that introduced uncertainty in the comparison with other effectors. The results support the global allostery model by showing that conformational changes propagate from the effector binding site to the interdimeric interfaces in both quaternary states.

Hemoglobin (1Perutz M.F. Bolton W. Diamond R. Murihead H. Nature. 1964; 203: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) is a tetrameric protein, which plays a vital role in the transport of oxygen. It consists of two dimers of α and β subunits that reversibly bind and release oxygen (1Perutz M.F. Bolton W. Diamond R. Murihead H. Nature. 1964; 203: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The description of this cooperative phenomenon has been most frequently derived from the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) 2The abbreviations used are: MWC, the two-state allosteric model of Monod; Wynan, and Changeaux; HbA, human adult hemoglobin; oxy-Hb, native human adult hemoglobin A linked to oxygen; α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb, zinc-substituted α(FeO2)2-β(Zn)2 human hemoglobin; Zn-PP-IX, zinc-protoporphyrin-IX; IHP, inositol hexaphosphate; BZF, bezafibrate; DPG, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; MPa, megapascal; GPa, gigapascal; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.2The abbreviations used are: MWC, the two-state allosteric model of Monod; Wynan, and Changeaux; HbA, human adult hemoglobin; oxy-Hb, native human adult hemoglobin A linked to oxygen; α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb, zinc-substituted α(FeO2)2-β(Zn)2 human hemoglobin; Zn-PP-IX, zinc-protoporphyrin-IX; IHP, inositol hexaphosphate; BZF, bezafibrate; DPG, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate; MPa, megapascal; GPa, gigapascal; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. two-state allosteric model (2Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6130) Google Scholar) that attributes cooperativity to a rapid equilibrium between two conformations of distinct oxygen affinity of the whole tetramer. These distinct states are the fully unliganded T-state and the fully ligated R-state. Szabo and Karplus (3Szabo A. Karplus M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 163-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) modified the two-state model incorporating the stereochemical mechanism suggested by Perutz (4Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar) for the T to R switch, and introduced ligation-induced tertiary changes within the T-state. In this extended model (MWC-SK), it was proposed that cooperativity still works through a ligation-induced shift in the equilibrium of states T and R, but the model attributed importance in the conformational switch to certain changes at the inter- and intrasubunit interfaces. Upon ligation in the T-state, the network of intersubunit interactions become perturbed, some (e.g. salt bridges) become broken up to release the characteristic strain of the T-state. The mechanism involves a rotation of one dimer with respect to the other, thus reaching the more relaxed R-state (5Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It has been widely reported that some molecules, referred to as heterotropic allosteric effectors, considerably lower the oxygen affinity of the T-state upon binding to HbA but not to the heme (6Lalezari I.

Structural studies in the T-state showed that these allosteric effectors primarily bind to the central cavity of HbA (10Arnone A. Nature. 1972; 237: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 11Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK1982: 106-158Google Scholar, 12Poyart C. Marden M.C. Kister J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 496-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The modulation of the oxygen dissociation curves by allosteric effectors is addressed in the extended MWC model by the assumption that allosteric effectors bind specifically to the somewhat larger central cavity of the T-state and stabilize this conformation. This shifts the R/T equilibrium in favor of the T-state and consequently lowers the overall affinity to oxygen (8Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Luisi B. Shaanan B. Liddington R.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 1987; 20: 309-321Crossref Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 13Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A. Paoli M. Dodson G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The well known Bohr effect and results reported for Cl–, also influencing the oxygen affinity of the T-state (14Haire R.N. Hedlund B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4135-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Seixas F.A. de Azevedo Jr., W.F. Colombo M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1914-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), show that, in a broader sense, H+ and Cl– can also be considered as being members of the family of allosteric effectors. Extended studies on the effect of allosteric effectors, however, indicated that they not only bind to the T-state but also to the R-state (16Gray R.D. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 249: 4770-4775Google Scholar, 17Van Beek G.G.M. De Bruin S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The modulation of the oxygen association constants was shown to occur at a much broader scale (65-fold change in KT and 2000-fold change in KR; see Ref. 18Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34508-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for details) in each state than previously known. These data initiated the reformulation of the earlier models for the allosteric action of heterotropic effectors. The recently proposed “global allostery model” (18Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34508-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) supposes that the effectors can bind to both the T- and R-states and that effectors induce direct tertiary conformational changes. These tertiary effects then lead to the detected changes in oxygen association (18Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Until now, no structural data have been published for the complex of R-state human HbA with allosteric effectors; the only available structure is that of horse HbA complexed to CO (20Shibayama N. Miura S. Tame J.R.H. Yonetani T. Park S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38791-38796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a docking and molecular dynamics simulation study in our laboratory (21Laberge M. Kövesi I. Yonetani T. Fidy J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) proposed models for the structure of HbA bound with the allosteric effectors DPG, IHP, and 2-{4-{(3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamoyl)-{methyl}-phenoxy}-2-methylpropionoc acid. These results supported the model allowing for binding of effectors also in the R-state and proposed primary binding sites in the central cavity of the R-state tetramer. In this paper we report the results of high pressure studies. We show that pressure perturbation of the structure is a valuable tool providing the means to measure the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant. This parameter reports structural changes at the interdimeric interface. High pressure is known to have distinct effects on proteins (22Heremans K. Smeller L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 353-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) depending on the applied pressure range. Typically, 0.5–1 GPa is needed to denature a protein, by squeezing water into the interior (23Smeller L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1595: 11-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Lower pressure causes elastic deformations, the extent of which are characteristic of the compressibility (24Köhler M. Friedrich J. Fidy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 255-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Fidy J. Balog E. Köhler M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) of the protein. Because pressure is a thermodynamic parameter, pressure can shift thermodynamic equilibria of various kinds, including conformational transitions of proteins (26Balny C. Masson P. Heremans K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1595: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One such equilibrium that is typically perturbed by pressure is oligomer dissociation. Pressures in the range of 100–200 MPa have been shown to be able to affect the quaternary structure of the proteins without affecting their secondary and tertiary structure (27Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. A. 1993; 44: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Previous pressure experiments performed on HbA (28Pin S. Royer C.A. Gratton E. Alpert A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9194-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 29Ogunmola G.B. Zipp A. Chen F. Kauzmann W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 1933-1940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that pressure tuning affects various optical properties (e.g. light scattering, absorption, fluorescence emission, and CD spectra) of the sample. In a detailed study, Pin et al. (28Pin S. Royer C.A. Gratton E. Alpert A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9194-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that applying pressure at pH 7 and 10–6– 10–4 m protein concentration will shift the tetramer-dimer equilibrium in favor of the dimers, and at pH 9, the observed dimer-monomer equilibrium will be shifted in favor of the monomers. Although Pin et al. (28Pin S. Royer C.A. Gratton E. Alpert A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9194-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) included IHP in their study, no systematic study applying pressure perturbation was conducted to observe the effect of various allosteric effectors on the subunit interfaces in HbA. In this study our goal was to compare the effect of allosteric effectors on the tetramer-dimer equilibrium in the T- and R-states by applying high hydrostatic pressure and steady-state fluorescence techniques. Based on literature data (31Hirsh R.E. Nagel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1080-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hirsh R.E. Zukin R.S. Nagel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we have used the intrinsic fluorescence of the tryptophan residues as a marker of changes at the interface region. Measurements under high hydrostatic pressure were, however, not feasible on deoxyhemoglobin, because the sample holder inside the pressure cell cannot be isolated in a gas-tight manner from the pressure transmitter fluid (water) in the device. To overcome this difficulty, we used a hybrid hemoglobin, α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb to mimic the structure of the T-state. In this hybrid the hemes of the β subunit are replaced with Zn-protoporphyrin-IX, and the α-subunit hemes are oxygen-ligated. Oxygen equilibrium studies and x-ray crystallography have shown that this derivative, as a five-coordinated metal hybrid of HbA, can be considered analogous to T-state HbA (33Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Kitagawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Stefano Br. Stefano Bu. Manfredini M. Mozzarelli A. Bolognesi M. Deriu D. Rosano C. Tsuneshige A. Yonetani T.

The selection of zinc substitution is supported by results that show a low energetic cost compared with other (for e.g. cobalt) metal substitutions (36Huang Y. Doyle M.L. Ackers G.K. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2094-2105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This indicates that the conformation is close to the native form. It can be considered questionable, however, for which of the T-state subpopulations the analogy holds. The conformation within being “T” was shown to be slightly tunable by environmental conditions, for example by sol-gel encapsulation (37Samuni U. Dantsker D. Juszczak L.J. Bettati S. Ronda L. Mozzarelli A. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13674-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Samuni U. Roche C.J. Dantsker D. Juszczak L.J. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2820-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This tunability was also found within zinc hybrids rendering the CO-ligated form the least tense among a variety of ligated forms and external conditions (39Samuni U. Juszczak L. Dantsker D. Khan I. Friedman A.J. Pérez-González-de-Apodaca J. Bruno S. Hui L.H. Colby J.E. Karasik E. Kwiatkowski L.D. Mozzarelli A. Noble R. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8272-8288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Literature data, however, show that the zinc hybrids in general have lower oxygen affinity than deoxy-HbA (40Miyazaki G. Morimoto H. Yun K.M. Park S.Y. Nagakawa A. Minagawa H. Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 1121-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on this we considered the (αFeO2)2-(βZn)2 form, which may be the least tense among the zinc hybrids, a sufficiently good model for the native T-state under physiological conditions. We used the oxy-form of HbA to study the R-state. The effect of the allosteric effectors Cl–, IHP, DPG, and BZF was investigated at pH 7.4 by pressure stability measurements based on the sensitivity of tryptophan fluorescence to structural changes of HbA. We observe a structural transition of the protein in the range of 100–200 MPa, and we argue for this being a tetramer-dimer transition. We show that the characteristic pressure of this transition, and thus the equilibrium constant (Kd0) of the reaction, is sensitive to the presence of allosteric effectors both in the R- and in the T-analogue state of HbA. These data characterize the dimer interface of the tetramer that was shown to play a decisive role in the cooperativity of oxygen binding. The reliability of the methodology was confirmed by parallel experiments with horse heart oxy-myoglobin. Materials—Myoglobin (horse heart), sodium chloride, HEPES, IHP, DPG, and BZF, the highest purity available, were purchased from Sigma. All samples (both myoglobin and HbA) were prepared in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with deionized water. IHP and DPG was used in a final concentration of 2 mm, BZF at 10 mm, and the sodium chloride concentration was 100 mm. The IHP, DPG, and BZF concentrations were selected as described previously (19Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and these concentrations are well in excess of the 0.06 mm HbA concentration used in the comparative experiments thus ensuring the saturation of the binding sites. Myoglobin was used only in the oxygen-saturated form. Hemoglobin Preparation—HbA was prepared from human blood as described previously (19Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) according to the method of Drabkin (41Drabkin D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 703-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HbA was promptly converted to the CO form and stripped of organic phosphates by the method of Berman et al. (42Berman M. Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 145: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and further purified by ion exchange chromatography. The final HbA solution was eluted in 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The native oxygenated HbA samples are referred to as oxy-Hb, and these were obtained from the CO form by strong illumination and a flow of pure oxygen above the sample, which was kept on ice. Zinc-substituted HbA was prepared from human HbA as described previously (43Tsuneshige A. Yonetani T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits were isolated from CO HbA, and the β subunit was converted to apoprotein by the acid-acetone method and then incubated with Zn-PP-IX to create β-zinc subunits. Finally, the α-Fe and β-zinc subunits were mixed and incubated in the cold for 2 days. The (αFe-CO)2-(β-Zn)2 form was then converted to the oxy form as described above. The (αFeO2)2-(βZn)2-hemoglobin hybrid is referred to as α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb in this paper. All samples were adjusted to 60 μm final heme concentration before measurement, unless stated otherwise (for concentration dependence measurements). The stripped forms (containing no organic phosphates or Cl–) were used as reference in all measurements. Possible denaturation or deoxygenation during experiments was controlled by recording the absorption spectrum. No significant changes were detected in the 270–700 nm wavelength range upon the addition of various effectors or upon increasing the pressure. Fluorescence Emission Spectra under High Pressure—A high pressure cell with sapphire windows (Unipress, Warsaw, Poland) was mounted in a Fluorolog-3 (Yobin Ivon Inc. Lonjumeau, France) spectrofluorometer. High pressure was created by a manually driven pump (Nova Swiss, Effretikon, Switzerland), and pressure was monitored with a pressure transducer (DMS-580.4018 Nova Swiss, Effretikon, Switzerland) equipped with a digital meter, with an accuracy of 10 bar. The sample was allowed to equilibrate at each pressure for 3 min. Spectra were acquired by integrating for 1 s at each wavelength, with slits adjusted at 5 nm excitation and 2 nm emission bandpass. The spectrofluorometer was equipped with a 450-watt xenon lamp (Osram, München, Germany) as light source. The temperature was maintained by a thermostat at 20 °C and was directly controlled in the sample. The HbA sample was injected into a quartz tube (UV-fused silica) with a 2.4-mm inner diameter with 1.3-mm wall thickness and 19-mm height. The sample volume was 110 μl. This tube was covered with a rubber stopper and placed into the pressure cell. The pressure transmitter fluid was water. Spectral shift under pressurization was determined based on either the maximum position of the emission band determined by a Savitzky-Golay algorithm or the center of gravity of the band in the 300–400-nm range. Both kinds of evaluation lead to the same information. We report data based on the maximum positions. Absorption Spectra at High Pressure—The high pressure cell was mounted in a Cary 4E UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc, Palo Alto, CA) and kept at 20 °C. Spectra were acquired at a scan rate of 1 nm/s, using the full height slit mode, allowing for 1 nm bandpass. Control spectra before pressurization were acquired in the quartz tube, covered with a rubber stopper, and placed centered in the light beam. FTIR Spectroscopy Under Pressure—The infrared spectra were obtained with a Bruker IFS66 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a broad band MCT solid-state detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. During data acquisition, 256 interferograms were co-added at a resolution of 2 cm–1. High pressure was generated in a diamond anvil cell (Diacell Products, Leicester, UK), where the pressure was built up by means of a screw mechanism. Barium sulfate was used as an internal pressure standard in all cases (44Wong P.T.T. Moffat D.J. Appl. Spectrosc. 1989; 43: 1279-1281Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 25 °C. The broad band of water around 3350 cm–1 was used to control that the solvent is still in the fluid phase even at the highest pressure used in the experiments. No crystallization was observed in the experiments reported here. The overlapping components of the amide I/I′ band were resolved by Fourier self-deconvolution (45Kauppinen J.K. Moffat D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar), which decreases the width of the component lines of the amide band. The optimal parameters were determined from the analysis of the power spectrum (46Smeller L. Goossens K. Heremans K. Appl. Spectrosc. 1995; 49: 1538-1542Crossref Google Scholar). A resolution enhancement factor (45Kauppinen J.K. Moffat D.J. Mantsch H.H. Cameron D.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1981; 35: 271-276Crossref Google Scholar) of 1.5 was reached by using a Lorentzian band shape of 20 cm–1 bandwidth. The deconvoluted spectra were then fitted with gaussian functions, and the peak position of the band characteristic for α-helical structure was determined. Oxy-Hb and α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb samples corresponding to the R- and T-analogue state HbA, respectively, were studied in stripped condition as reference and then bound to various allosteric effectors. The effect of allosteric effectors was monitored by registering the conformational perturbation effect of high pressure using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Effects Shown by Tryptophan Fluorescence—In Fig. 1, the solid lines show the fluorescence emission spectra of stripped oxy-Hb (a) and α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb (b) at ambient pressure; the dashed lines are spectra at a pressure of 350 MPa. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm for both samples to directly excite the Trp residues. It is seen that the intrinsic Trp fluorescence is easily measured under the experimental conditions, and a pressure effect can be observed. In the case of oxy-Hb, the emission peak characteristic for the Trp fluorescence can be observed around 330–340 nm, as seen in Fig. 1a. For α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb (Fig. 1b), characteristic Zn-PP-IX emission peaks also appear at 594 and 645 nm, indicative of energy transfer from Trp to the Zn-PP-IX. This is also seen in Fig. 1b, inset, where it is directly shown that Zn-PP-IX fluorescence can be excited by Trp absorption. Energy transfer from Trps to the hemes can also be considered in the case of oxy-Hb. A proof for this is a slight dip in the emission spectrum (Fig. 1a) around the wavelength of the Soret maximum (∼420 nm). It can be seen that increased pressure induces a red shift (cf. Fig. 1a, inset), broadening of the Trp fluorescence emission band, and a significant increase of emission intensity. The red shift of the Trp emission versus pressure has a sigmoidal character in all kinds of Hb samples. Fig. 2 shows the maximum positions of the emission peaks versus pressure in both quaternary states in the presence of 100 mm chloride. The fluorescence intensity showed the same feature when plotted as a function of increasing pressure (Fig. 3). Both kinds of evaluations lead to a feature that is indicative of a pressure-induced conformational transition. The pressure at 50% transition of a specific sample is very similar when determined from the maximum position or from the increase of quantum yield of Trp emission. In the comparative analysis of the effect of allosteric effectors, we used the data obtained from the red shift of the maximum position. Table 1 shows that the characteristic pressures were sensitive to the presence of bound allosteric effectors in both quaternary states. For comparison we used the data obtained at 60 μm concentration.FIGURE 3Tryptophan fluorescence intensity at the tryptophan emission maximum versus hydrostatic pressure.

Inset shows data for myoglobin; solid line is a linear fit to the data. b, α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb with 100 mm chloride; p½ is 151 MPa.

The results are shown in the insets of the figures reporting data for HbA. Fig. 2a and Fig. 3a, insets, show the maximum position and the intensity of the Trp emission maximum of myoglobin in the function of pressure, respectively. In contrast to HbA, myoglobin shows a different behavior. The shift of the maximum position is relatively small (few nm/100 MPa) and is strictly linear. The intensity linearly decreases with increasing pressure, in contrast to the sigmoidal intensity increase observed in HbA (Fig. 2a). Pressure Effect on the Porphyrin Spectra—The electronic transition energy of the porphyrin, monitored either by fluorescence of α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb or by the absorption spectra of oxy-Hb, did not show a structural transition upon applying high pressure, unlike that of the Trps. A linear dependence of the maximum position could be measured in the function of increasing pressure up to 350 MPa as shown in Fig. 4. Both the Soret band position in the absorption spectrum of oxy-Hb seen in Fig. 4a and the Q-band position in the fluorescence spectrum of α-oxy-Fe-βZn-Hb seen in Fig. 4b show a linear dependence. Similarly, linear shifting effects of pressure were observed in all sam"

Here we report profound effects of the Kv4.2 C terminus on the surface expression and activation gating properties of Kv4.2 that are modulated by the direct interaction between KChIP2, an auxiliary regulatory subunit, and the C terminus of Kv4.2. We show that increasingly large truncations of the C terminus of rat Kv4.2 (wild type) cause a progressive decrease of Kv4.2 current along with a shift in voltage-dependent activation that is closely correlated with negative charge deletion. Co-expression of more limited Kv4.2 C-terminal truncation mutants (T588 and T528) with KChIP2 results in a doubling of Kv4.2 protein expression and up to an 8-fold increase in Kv4.2 current amplitude. Pulsechase experiments show that co-expression with KChIP2 slows Kv4.2 wild type degradation 8-fold. Co-expression of KChIP2 with an intermediate-length C-terminal truncation mutant (T474) shifts Kv4.2 activation voltage dependence and enhances expression of Kv4.2 current. The largest truncation mutants (T417 and ΔC) show an intracellular localization with no measurable currents and no response to KChIP2 co-expression. Co-immunoprecipitation and competitive glutathione S-transferase-binding assays indicate a direct interaction between KChIP2 and the Kv4.2 C terminus with a relative binding affinity comparable with that of the N terminus.

Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recent work has demonstrated that Kv4 channel subunits form molecular complexes consisting of pore-forming α-subunits along with auxiliary subunits and associated scaffolding proteins (7Birnbaum S.G.

The Kv channel-interacting proteins bind to the N terminus of Kv4 α-subunits and produce isoform-dependent effects on Kv4 channel trafficking and gating properties (8An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M.

In the heart, the KChIP2 isoforms predominate and have a transmural expression profile in dogs and humans that parallels, and probably explains, a well recognized gradient in Ito (10Patel S.P.

The C terminus of Kv4 channel subunits has also been implicated in the localization and gating of the Kv4.2 channel. An interaction between a proline-rich C terminus domain and the actin-binding protein, filamin, contributes to the localization of Kv4.2 at synaptic densities (14Petrecca K. Miller D.M. Shrier A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8736-8744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 16-amino acid dileucine-containing motif has also been identified in the C terminus of Shal family K+ channels that is necessary for dendritic targeting of Kv4.2 channels (15Rivera J.F. Ahmad S. Quick M.W. Liman E.R. Arnold D.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Two arginines (Arg426 and Arg429) in the C-terminal domain of Kv4.3 channel subunits are involved in voltage-dependent gating of Kv4.3 currents; replacement of these two arginines with alanines voltage-shifts both activation and inactivation gating (16Hatano N. Ohya S. Muraki K. Clark R.B. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5450-5459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, the Kv4 C-terminal domain interacts with Kv β-subunits (17Yang E.K. Alvira M.R. Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and scaffold proteins like PSD95 (18Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the ability of Kv4.2 to immunoprecipitate KChIP2 is heavily compromised when there are major deletions in the C terminus of Kv4.2 (19Callsen B. Isbrandt D. Sauter K. Hartmann L.S. Pongs O. Bahring R. J. Physiol. 2005; 568: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent negative stain electron microscopy studies of Kv4.2 channels co-expressed with KChIP2 also suggest that KChIP2 may associate with the C terminus of Kv4.2 (32Kim L.A. Furst J. Gutierrez D. Butler M.H. Xu S. Goldstein S.A. Grigorieff N. Neuron. 2004; 41: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigate in detail the role of the Kv4 C terminus by examining the consequences of a series of Kv4.2 C-terminal truncation mutants. We study the contribution of the C terminus to the expression and gating of Kv4.2. We also characterize the biochemical and functional properties of these mutant constructs with and without KChIP2 co-expression. The results indicate a direct binding between the C terminus of Kv4.2 and KChIP2 that is critical for normal Kv4.2 channel stability, functional expression, and gating. Preparation of cDNA Constructs—Full-length rat Kv4.2 WT 3The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; CASK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NT, N terminus; CT, C terminus; pF, picofarads; KChIP2, Kv channel-interacting protein 2. was generated by PCR amplification using 5′ and 3′ primers with BglII and NotI recognition sequences, respectively. The amplified product was digested with BglII and NotI restriction enzymes and subcloned in-frame into HA-tagged pHA-CMV vector (Clontech). Full-length rat KChIP2 was PCR-amplified using 5′ and 3′ primers that introduced XhoI and NotI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends and subcloned in-frame into pHA-CMV and p-c-myc-CMV (Clontech), respectively. Truncation mutant constructs were made by amplifying Kv4.2 WT plasmid with the same forward primer as for Kv4.2 WT and a series of reverse primers containing a NotI recognition site and in-frame stop codon with a partial Kv4.2 WT sequence that extends from the distal N terminus to each selected position in the post-transmembrane region on the C terminus (positions 406, 417, 474, 528, and 588), thereby truncating the more distal portion of the C terminus, as shown in Fig. 1 (top). These were correspondingly named ΔC (the T406 truncation of the entire Kv4.2 C terminus), T417, T474, T528, and T588. Deletion and negative charge neutralization mutants were constructed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) and Kv4.2 WT as the PCR template. Kv4 N-terminal deletions were named according to the numbers of the residues deleted (e.g. Kv4.2Δ2–31 means that the residues between 2 and 31 were removed). All PCR amplifications were conducted with a proofreading enzyme (Vent DNA Polymerase; New England Biolabs), and PCR products were purified with QIAquick gel extraction kits (Qiagen). Ligation reagents, restriction enzymes, and primers were purchased from New England Biolabs and Invitrogen, respectively. The fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by capillary electrophoresis-based sequencing (Sheldon Biotechnology Center, McGill University). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293, COS7, and M2 cells were used and maintained as previously described (20Akhavan A. Atanasiu R. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40105-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The interaction between Kv4.2 and KChIP2 was preserved in all cell lines. Cell cultures at 60–80% confluence were used for transfection. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Since the molecular mass of Kv4.2 is approximately double that of KChIP2, we transfected twice the amount of cDNA by weight of Kv4.2 over that of KChIP2 in an attempt to obtain a similar number of transcripts of Kv4.2 and KChIP2. Cells 24 h post-transfection were subjected to Western blot, pulse-chase analysis, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, or electrophysiological analysis. No cells were used beyond 30 passages. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transfected HEK293 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors, pH 8.0). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 45 min to pellet insoluble material. The resulting supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined with a detergent-compatible assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, samples with equal amounts of protein and volume incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA; Covance) or anti-c-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies (1:100) were immobilized on Protein G-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer and eluted by incubation with 2× SDS sample buffer for 40 min at room temperature. For Western blot, samples were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk and incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-HA or anti-c-myc and/or anti-calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK; Babco) antibodies, respectively. Immunoreactivity was detected by incubating membranes with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) after extensive washes and visualized on Eastman Kodak Co. BMS film with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were quantified with an FC8000 densitometer, and the results are presented as arbitrary units normalized either to endogenous CASK or to relative controls. GST Fusion Protein Pulldown Assays—For GST fusion proteins, the N (residues 1–183, ending at Met183) and C (residues 406–630) termini of Kv4.2 as well as four fragments of the C terminus (residues 406–474, 417–474, 474–630, and 417–630) were PCR-amplified and inserted in frame into bacterial PGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). After sequence verification, plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Clonal BL21 cells were grown to a density of ∼0.8–1.0 A600 at 37 °C, and then protein expression was induced by adding 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (3-h incubation, 30 °C). After cell lysis, GST fusion proteins were purified following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified GST alone and GST fusion proteins were quantified by Coomassie Blue staining followed by analysis with an FC8000 imaging densitometer. Equal amounts of protein were added to 50 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B bead slurry (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors in PBS, pH 8.0) and incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 4 h. After three washes with lysis buffer, 100 μg of c-myc-KChIP2 lysate was added, rocked overnight at 4 °C, and washed four times. Competitive GST pulldown assays were performed by incubating various concentrations of purified N terminus (NT) and C terminus (CT) of Kv4.2 with fixed concentrations of GST-fused Kv4.2 N terminus (GST.Kv4.2NT) and C terminus (GST.Kv4.2CT), respectively, overnight at 4 °C with 100 μg of whole cell lysate from HEK293 cells transfected with c-myc-KChIP2. The purified N and C termini were obtained by cutting the GST.Kv4.2NT and GST.Kv4.2CT with thrombin and subsequently using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads to remove the cleaved GST. Co-precipitates were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot. Pulse-Chase Metabolic Labeling—Transfected HEK293 cells were washed once with warmed PBS and starved for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine in the presence of 0.25% bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen). Cells were then metabolically labeled in the same medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at 37 °C. The medium was then removed, and cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm unlabeled methionine and cysteine and chased in the same medium for different time intervals. Cells were lysed as described above, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-c-myc antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography followed by quantification with an FC8000 densitometer. Immunolocalization—COS7 cells transfected with Kv4.2 constructs singly or co-transfected with c-myc-KChIP2 were fixed on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was suppressed in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Staining was performed with monoclonal rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and/or mouse anti-c-myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, followed by Cy5 goat polyclonal anti-rat IgG (Abcam) and/or Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min, with extensive washing with PBS before and after the addition of the secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Immuno-Fluore Mounting Media (ICN Biomedicals). Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100-M microscope coupled to a Zeiss LSM-510 laser-scanning confocal system. Electrophysiology—M2 cells (a melanoma cell line) were used for all electrophysiological studies, because they are amenable to patch clamping. The plasmids (0.5 μg) indicated in Fig. 1 (top) and CD8 plasmid (0.1 μg) were co-transfected with KChIP2 (0.25 μg) into M2 cells. Immunomagnetic Dynabeads (Dynal) precoated with a monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody were used to select transfected cells for patch-clamp recording. To estimate selection efficiency, sister cells transfected with Kv4.2 WT were always recorded prior to mutant variants. Selection efficiency varied between 70 and 90%. The whole cell patchclamp technique was performed on the stage of an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM35) with an Alembic VE-2 amplifier at room temperature as previously described (20Akhavan A. Atanasiu R. Shrier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40105-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Micropipettes were filled with a solution containing 130 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). The external solution contained 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Voltage pulses (2 s) were imposed from a holding potential of –80 mV to voltages between –40 and +70 mV in increments of 10 mV. To assess voltage-dependent inactivation, 2-s test pulses to +50 mV were preceded by 1.5-s conditioning pulses to voltages between –140 and –10 mV. Current amplitude was measured from the peak current level to the steady-state end pulse level. Mean cell capacitance averaged 7.4 ± 0.3 pF (n = 206). Current densities are normalized to cell capacitance. Data were collected and analyzed with Clampex 8 and Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t test was used to compare means. A two-tailed p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Kv4.2 C Terminus Truncation Modifies Kv4.2 Current Density and Voltage-dependent Activation—Kv4.2 mutants were constructed by truncating from the distal end of the C terminus to residues 588 (T588), 528 (T528), 474 (T474), 417 (T417), and 406 (ΔC), respectively, as shown schematically in Fig. 1 (top). Fig. 1A shows representative families of outward currents in M2 cells expressing Kv4.2 WT and the various truncation mutants. With increasing C terminus truncation, the transient outward current amplitude decreased progressively, as summarized in Fig. 1B. Expression of truncation channels extending to T417 or beyond (ΔC) failed to produce any Kv4.2 transient outward current but instead showed currents similar to the endogenous (Endo.) currents obtained in control transfections with CD8 alone. C terminus truncations produced progressive depolarizing shifts in transient current activation voltage dependence (Fig. 2A). The half-maximal activation voltage (V½), estimated from the Boltzmann equation best fit to these activation curves, shifted by ∼30 mV from –17 ± 4 mV (n = 7) for Kv4.2 WT to 12 ± 3 mV (n = 8, p < 0.001) for T474, with no significant change in slope factor. The voltage sensitivity of a channel is reflected by the equivalent charge movement associated with the activation curves (21Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The numbers of equivalent charges (z) determined from the slope = RT/zF of the activation curves were not significantly different in Kv4.2 WT and the truncation mutants (data not shown). The change in the net charge of the C terminus truncation mutants is not correlated with the shift in voltage-dependent activation (R2 = 0.3213). In contrast, there is a strong linear correlation between the depolarizing shift of voltage-dependent activation of the truncation mutants and the number of negatively charged residues deleted from the C terminus (R2 = 0.9717), as shown in Fig. 2B; the correlation between positively charged residues and activation shift was slightly less robust (R2 = 0.8567). We evaluated the effect of neutralizing the six negative charge residues present in Kv4.2 WT that had been truncated in T588 (Glu589/Glu609/Asp611/Asp612/Glu615/Glu618). We found that neutralizing these six charges by site-directed mutagenesis to noncharged residues caused a positive shift in the activation V½ from –17 ± 4 mV (n = 7) for Kv4.2 WT to –8 ± 4 mV (n = 6, p = 0.02 versus WT), not significantly different from the V½ of –4 ± 4 mV found with T588 (n = 7, p < 0.01 versus WT). This result suggests that these distal C-terminal negative charges influence voltage gating and probably account for the activation voltage shift in T588. We also created constructs with 10 and 18 negatively charged residues neutralized, corresponding to T528 and T474 truncations; however, these constructs failed to express measurable currents. Fig. 2C shows normalized inactivation curves for the Kv4.2 truncation mutants. For less extensive truncations (T588 and T528), the V½ and slope factor were not significantly different from Kv4.2 WT (see supplemental Fig. 1A). However, the largest truncation construct we studied that generated a measurable transient outward current, T474, had a V½ of –58 ± 4 mV (n = 6), significantly depolarized (p < 0.05) compared with the value (–69 ± 2 mV, n = 6) for Kv4.2 WT. T474 was associated with a small but significant increase (p < 0.05) in the slope factor of the Boltzmann function from –11 ± 1 in Kv4.2 WT to –14 ± 1 in T474 (see supplemental Fig. 1A). The inactivation kinetics of Kv4.2 WT and truncation mutants were well fit by the sum of two exponentials (see supplemental Fig. 1B). The fast inactivation time constants for T588 and T528, evaluated at +50 mV, were unchanged from WT. On the other hand, both fast and slow time constants were significantly longer in T474 than Kv4.2 WT. The kinetics of the recovery from inactivation of Kv4.2 were unaffected by truncation of the Kv4.2 C terminus (Fig. 2D). Kv4.2 C Terminus Truncation Does Not Alter Total Kv4.2 Protein Levels—The expression level of Kv4.2 protein was examined 24 h post-transfection using Western blot analysis. Kv4.2 WT protein appeared as a 65-kDa form (Fig. 3A). With increasing Kv4.2 C-terminal truncation, there was a progressive decrease in molecular mass and accordingly a downward shift of the mutant bands. The transfection efficiencies of Kv4.2 WT and mutants, as determined by Western blot analysis of co-transfected green fluorescent protein, were similar (data not shown). Loading was assessed by examining the expression of endogenous CASK by stripping each membrane and reblotting with anti-CASK antibody (Fig. 3A, bottom). We corrected for any differences in loading by normalizing target band intensities to those of CASK. Kv4.2 C terminus truncation did not significantly alter total channel protein expression relative to Kv4.2 WT, based on seven transfection and immunoblot experiments with each construct (Fig. 3B). C Terminus Truncation Reduces the Modulation of Kv4.2 Function and Expression by KChIP2—We co-transfected KChIP2 with Kv4.2 WT and a series of C terminus truncation mutants into M2 cells at a 1:2 weight ratio (the molecular mass of Kv4.2 is approximately double that of KChIP2). A comparison of currents in the absence (gray recordings in Fig. 4A) and presence of KChIP2 indicate an approximately 3-fold increase in Kv4.2 WT current upon co-transfection with KChIP2 (black recordings). Similar current enhancement by KChIP2 was found for the smaller truncation mutants (T588 and T528; Fig. 4B), for which KChIP2 co-expression restored the current density toward that of Kv4.2 WT. For the T474 mutant, current density increased ∼3.3-fold but remained well below the level of Kv4.2 WT. No current enhancement resulted from KChIP2 co-expression for the larger truncation mutants, T417 and ΔC. For comparison, we examined the effect of deleting the N-terminal fragment between residues 2 and 31 (Δ2–31), previously identified as an N terminus KChIP2 binding site (23Bahring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23888-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We found that Δ2–31 in the absence of KChIP2 had a current density (121 ± 20 pA/pF, n = 7) that was smaller than, but not significantly different (p = 0.44) from, Kv4.2 WT (172 ± 25 pA/pF, n = 8). When co-expressed with KChIP2, there was a significant increase in the density of Δ2–31 current (to 204 ± 41 pA/pF, n = 5) that was significantly less than the density of Kv4.2 WT when co-expressed with KChIP2 (461 ± 38 pA/pF, n = 8). We then sought to determine the effects of KChIP2 on channel gating and kinetics of C terminus truncation mutants. Co-expression of Kv4.2 with KChIP2 shifted Kv4.2 WT activation voltage dependence in the negative direction (Fig. 4, C and D), positively shifted voltage-dependent inactivation (Fig. 4E and supplemental Fig. 1C), accelerated recovery from inactivation (Fig. 4F), and slowed inactivation (see supplemental Fig. 1D). Similar responses to KChIP2 co-expression were seen for the less severe truncation mutants T588 and T528. For the T474 mutant, the only significant effect noted was an acceleration in the recovery from inactivation, which nonetheless remained significantly slower than that of WT or the less extensive truncation mutants. KChIP2 is known to increase the expression levels of Kv4 (9Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I. Sweatt J.D. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36445-36454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 demonstrates that the increase in protein expression level induced by KChIP2 in Kv4.2 WT is severely compromised in the C terminus truncation mutants. As shown in Fig. 5A, KChIP2 significantly increased band intensities for Kv4.2 WT, T588, and T528. KChIP2 slightly shifted Kv4.2 WT and T588 band densities to increased Mr values. The expression levels of Kv4.2 WT and the smaller truncation mutants T588 and T528 were approximately doubled by co-expression with KChIP2 (Fig. 5B), whereas the expression of larger truncation mutants was not significantly affected. Of note was the absence of any change in protein level for T474 (Fig. 5B), despite the fact that KChIP2 significantly enhanced functional expression (Fig. 4B). With truncation beyond T417, there was no rescue of transient outward current upon co-expression with KChIP2. Evidence for a Direct Interaction between KChIP2 and the C Terminus of Kv4.2—The decrease in the modulation of Kv4.2 by KChIP2 resulting from C-terminal truncations suggests that KChIP2 could be physically associated with the C terminus of Kv4.2. The N terminus of Kv4.2 contains a region from amino acid residue 2 to 31 that is believed to be necessary for KChIP2 binding (9Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A.

The marked and delayed impairment of cAMP signaling and episodic GnRH release in GT1–7 cells is prevented by pertussis toxin (PTX). This, and the LH-induced release of membrane-bound Gαs and Gαi3 subunits, are indicative of differential G protein coupling to the LHR. Action potential (AP) firing in identified GnRH neurons also initially increased and then progressively decreased during LH treatment. The inhibitory action of LH on AP firing was also prevented by PTX. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of GT1–7 neurons revealed the expression of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels in these cells. The LH-induced currents were inhibited by PTX and were identified as GIRK currents. These responses indicate that agonist stimulation of endogenous LHR expressed in GnRH neurons activates GIRK channels, leading to suppression of membrane excitability and inhibition of AP firing. These findings demonstrate that regulation of GIRK channel function is a dominant factor in gonadotropin-induced abolition of pulsatile GnRH release.

The pulsatile mode of hypothalamic GnRH secretion and receptor activation in pituitary gonadotrophs is essential for the maintenance of episodic gonadotropin synthesis and secretion, and ultimately for normal reproductive function. Pioneering studies on Rhesus monkeys by Knobil et al. (1Knobil E. Hum. Reprod. 1988; 3: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) defined the importance of episodic pituitary stimulation for optimal gonadotropin secretion in Rhesus as well as the relationship of GnRH release to electrical activity in the hypothalamus. Marked inhibition of multiunit electrical activity was observed during initiation of the preovulatory lutenizing hormone (LH) 3The abbreviations used are: LH, luteinizing hormone; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; PAPP, 4-[2-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-piperazinyl] ethyl]benzeneamine p-aminophenethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine; AP, action potentials; GIRK, G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium; RT, reverse transcriptase; nt, nucleotide(s); PKA, protein kinase A; PTX, pertussis toxin. surge, coincident with the late follicular rise in serum estradiol concentration (2Ordog T. Knobil E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5813-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, the operation of a short feedback loop between the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus has been indicated by the ability of LH to modulate its own secretion in vivo (3Martini L. Fraschini F. Motta M. Michael P.R. Endocrinology and Human Behavior. Oxford University Press, London1968: 175-185Google Scholar, 4Turgeon J.L. Barraclough C.A. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and to decrease single cell firing rates in the medial preoptic area and basal hypothalamus (5Wuttke W. Exp. Brain Res. 1974; 19: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured hypothalamic neurons, as well as immortalized pituitary gonadotrophs and GnRH-producing neurons, have provided insights into the complex actions of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and pituitary hormones in the control of episodic GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus (6Terasawa E. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1998; 112: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Kalra S.P. Horvath T. Naftolin F. Xu B. Pu S. Kalra P.S. J.

A. 1994; 91: 1244-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The functional properties of the GT1–7 cell line, which expresses receptors for GnRH, LH/hCG, and prolactin, as well as a variety of other hormones and transmitters, are closely similar to those of the native GnRH neuron (8Milenkovic L.

GT1–7 cells treated with LH or hCG exhibit a dose-dependent and rapid increase in cAMP production during the first 15 min, followed by a marked decrease that is prevented by pre-treatment with pertussis toxin. These data suggest that the LH/hCG receptors expressed in GT1–7 cells are sequentially coupled to adenylyl cyclase stimulatory Gs and inhibitory Gi proteins. The similarity of hCG action on pulsatile GnRH release to that of extracellular Ca2+ depletion and calcium channel antagonists, and its partial resistance to potassium-induced depolarization, have suggested that it results from inhibition of plasma-membrane ion channel activity (11Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present studies were performed to further clarify the signaling pathways, electrical activity, and secretory responses that are initiated by agonist activation of the endogenous LH/hCG receptors expressed in GT1–7 cells and native GnRH neurons. Tissue and Cell Culture—Hypothalamic tissue was removed from fetuses of 18-day pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (12Krsmanovic L.Z. Stojilkovic S.S. Balla T. al-Damluji S. Weiner R.I. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11124-11128Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The borders of the excised hypothalami were delineated by the anterior margin of the optic chiasm, the posterior margin of the mammillary bodies, and laterally by the hypothalamic sulci. The neuronal tissue was dispersed in 0.2% collagenase containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% glucose, and 0.05% DNase I. After incubation for 60 min, the tissue was gently triturated by repeated aspiration into a smooth-tipped Pasteur pipette, incubated for another 30 min, and again dispersed. The cell suspension was passed through sterile mesh and sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 200 × g, then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and once in culture medium consisting of 500 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.584 g/liter l-glutamate and 4.5 g/liter glucose, mixed with 500 ml of F-12 medium containing 0.146 g/liter l-glutamine, 1.8 g/liter glucose, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 2.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Each dispersed hypothalamus yielded about 1.5 × 106 cells. Immortalized GnRH neurons (GT1–7 cells) were provided by Dr. Richard Weiner (University of California, San Francisco) (13Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) and were cultured under the same conditions as primary hypothalamic cells. Cell Perifusion Procedure and Hormone Measurement—Bead-attached GT1–7 cells were perifused at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min at 37 °C. Fractions were collected at 5-min intervals and stored at –20 °C prior to radioimmunoassay. GnRH was measured using 125I-GnRH (Amersham Biosciences), GnRH standards (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) and primary antibody were donated by Dr. V. D. Ramirez (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL). The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation at 50% binding in standard samples (15 pg/ml) were 5 and 7%, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay, defined as twice the standard deviation at zero doses, was 0.2 pg/tube. Cyclic AMP Production—For studies on cAMP release, GT1–7 cells and hypothalamic neurons were stimulated in serum-free medium (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 30 mg/liter bacitracin, and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine. Radioimmunoassay of cAMP was performed as previously described, using a specific cAMP antiserum at a titer of 1:5000 (14Fujita K. Aguilera G. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8567-8574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intra-assay coefficient of variation of the assay was 4% at 50% displacement. Whole Cell Recording of GnRH Neurons—Whole cell recording was performed on identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons cultured on collagen-coated coverslips and continuously perifused with artificial extracellular solution at a rate of 0.6 ml/min. The extracellular solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 d-glucose, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2. pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. 30 μm Bicuculline and 5 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium salt were used to block excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. For GIRK current recording, extracellular KCl was increased to 30 mm and Na+ was substituted with 115 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine. Also, calcium current was blocked by 1.8 mm CoCl2, chloride current was blocked by 20 μm 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, and sodium current was blocked by 0.5 μm tetrodotoxin. GnRH neurons were viewed under an inverted microscope Olympus IX70 with a ×40 long working distance objective. All recordings were done at room temperature (23–25 °C) using patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) pulled from thick wall borosilicate capillary glass (1.5-mm outer diameter and 0.86-mm inner diameter, WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL) on a Flaming/Brown puller model P-87 (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA). The pipette solution contains (in mm): 20 KCl, 110 potassium gluconate, 10 Na2 creatine phosphate, 0.1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 K2ATP (ATP potassium salt), 0.2 Na2 GTP, 1 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. 50 μm ZD7288 (4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyridinium chloride) was added in the pipette solution to block Ih current. An Ag/AgCl pellet was used as the reference electrode. Spontaneous activities were recorded under the I-clamp mode with a Multi-Clamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 KHz, and digitized at 10 KHz with Digidata 1320A (Axon Instruments). In voltage-clamp mode, the serial resistance was compensated by 70%, and leak current was automatically subtracted during recording by Multiclamp 700A. Data acquisition and subsequent analysis were performed using Clampex 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). Voltage and current traces and current-voltage curves were exported into Origin 7.5 software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, MA) for further plotting. Individual hypothalamic neurons were selected by differential interference contrast microscopy, which permits their morphological identification in cultured hypothalamic cells with an accuracy of more than 95%. Under differential interference contrast illumination, two types of bipolar GnRH neurons were identified based on nuclear size and localization. One of these has a large and centrally placed nucleus that contains an apparent nucleolus with subpolar localization. The nucleus is surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm, which extends throughout the processes. The other type of GnRH neuron was characterized by the presence of a relatively large nucleus that occupied 50% of the cross-sectional area of the cell body. In these cells, the cytoplasm contained numerous granules. Both categories of cells showed well developed thick and quite long processes. After recording, the cytoplasmic contents of each neuron were harvested under visual control and subjected to single-cell RT-PCR to confirm the presence of GnRH transcripts as reported previously (15Martinez-Fuentes A.J. Hu L. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1808-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Skynner M.J. Sim J.A. Herbison A.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5195-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As controls, the contents of hypothalamic cells that did not show typical GnRH neuronal morphology were also analyzed by RT-PCR. RT-PCR Analysis of G Protein-gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium (GIRK) Channels—Total RNA extracted from GT1–7 cells using Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was digested with DNase in a low-salt buffer to remove any remaining DNA. RT was performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Using 5 μg of total RNA as template, first-strand cDNA was made using 500 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 and 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP Mix (Invitrogen) in a 130-μl reaction volume. After heat denaturing at 65 °C for 5 min and addition of 4 μl of 5 times First Strand Buffer, 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of RNase OUT Recombinant RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 200 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase, RT was performed at 55 °C for 50 min. RNA complementary to the cDNA was removed by addition of 1 μl of Escherichia coli RNase H and incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. An 0.5-μl aliquot of cDNA was used as template. Primers used were 5′-GCTATGGCTACCGCTACATCACAG-3′ (nt 479–502) (sense) and 5′-CCAGTTCAAGTTGGTCAAGGGG-3′ (nt 778–799) (antisense) for GIRK1 (accession number D45022); 5′-TCACCAGCCAAAGTTGCCTAAG-3′ (nt 574–595) (sense) and 5′-AAGCAGAGACAAACCCGTTGAG-3′ (nt 899–920) (antisense) for GIRK2 (accession number U11859); 5′-TTTCTCGTCTCACCTCTCGTCATC-3′ (nt 939–962) (sense) and 5′-CAGCCATTGTGCTCCTTGTCAG-3′ (nt 1348–1369) (antisense) for GIRK3 (accession number AF130860); 5′-GATTACATCCCCATTGCCACAG-3′ (nt 91–112) (sense) and 5′-GCCGCTAAGGTTTTCAACACAAG-3′ (nt 383–405) (antisense) for GIRK4 (accession number U33631); and 5′-AACGACCCCTTCATTGAC-3′ (nt 152–169) (sense) and 5′-TCCACGACATACTCAGCAC-3′ (nt 324–342) (antisense) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The expected sizes of GIRK1, GIRK2, GIRK3, GIRK4, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were, respectively, 321, 347, 431, 315, and 191 bp. PCR conditions were: denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. Immunoblot Analysis of Membrane-associated and Cytosolic Gαs and Gαi3 Subunits—GT1–7 cells were washed twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), then scraped from the plates and lysed by freeze-thawing. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and stored at –70 °C. For immunoblot analysis of cytosolic Gαs and Gαi3, GT1–7 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the culture dishes in buffer A (50 mm triethanolamine HCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm each aprotinin and leupeptin, pH 7.5) in the presence of sterile 0.25 m sucrose, and kept at –70 °C. Cells were subsequently lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 p.s.i. for 3 min, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove tissue debris (first pellet). The first supernatant was then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The second pellet was saved, and its supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C.The third supernatant was taken as cytosol. Protein contents were measured by the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. SDS-gel electrophoresis was performed on 8% acrylamide gels, followed by blotting with polyvinylidene difluoride membrane of 0.45-μm pore size. G proteins were detected by incubation of blots with first antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or first antibody preadsorbed with the corresponding peptide antigen (1:1000 + 10 μg of peptide), followed by peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Invitrogen). The immunoreactive bands were analyzed as three-dimensional digitized images using a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). The optical density (OD) of images is expressed as volume (OD × area) adjusted for the background, which gives arbitrary units of adjusted volume. Chemicals—Oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Probe Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD. Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit was purchased form Stratagene, La Jolla, CA. SuperScript III RNase H Reverse Transcriptase, Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, pCR2.1 vector, and TOPO TA cloning kit were purchased from Invitrogen. The Wizard Plus Minipreps DNA purification system was purchased from Promega, Madison, WI. Isoproterenol and the selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist analog PAPP were purchased from Sigma. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) peptide inhibitor was from Promega. Highly purified rat LH and hCG were obtained from Dr. A. F. Parlow (National Hormone and Peptide Program, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA). Data Analysis—GnRH pulses were identified and their parameters determined by computerized cluster analysis (17Urban R.J. Johnson M.L. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Individual point standard deviations were calculated using a power function variance model from the experimental duplicates. A 2 × 2 cluster configuration and a t-statistic of 2 for the up stroke and down stroke were used to maintain false-positive and false-negative error rates below 10%. The pulse parameters were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and results expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney U test. LH/hCG-induced Modulation of Pulsatile GnRH Release, cAMP Production, and Electrical Activity in Native and Immortalized GnRH Neurons—Perifused hypothalamic cells exhibited pulsatile GnRH release with clearly defined peaks and inter-peak intervals as determined by cluster pulse analysis (11Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Urban R.J. Johnson M.L. Veldhuis J.D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Treatment with 2 nm hCG had an initial stimulatory effect followed by marked inhibition of pulsatile GnRH release, which returned after the cessation of hCG treatment (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory action of hCG was prevented by prior treatment with PTX (200 ng/ml, 4 h), indicating that the gonadotropin-induced suppression of pulsatile GnRH release is mediated by activation of Gi/Go proteins (Fig. 1B). Signaling studies revealed that hCG-induced cAMP production in GT1–7 cells also exhibited an early stimulatory response and a delayed inhibitory phase. The decrease in cAMP production was prevented by treatment with pertussis toxin, consistent with the coupling of LH/hCG receptors to both Gs and Gi/o proteins (Fig. 1C). Treatment with the cAMP-dependent PKA peptide inhibitor (1 μm), prevented the time-dependent inhibition of cAMP production, indicating that activation of PKA promotes coupling of the LH/hCG receptor to Gi/Go (Fig. 1D). Whole cell recordings from identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons consistently revealed spontaneous AP firing, with most of the cells (75%) showing irregular spiking activity (Fig. 1E). Firing of spontaneous action potentials (AP) was also evident in GT1–7 neurons, with properties similar to those of hypothalamic GnRH neurons (Fig. 1I). Treatment with 2 nm LH caused time-dependent biphasic changes in the frequency of AP firing in both identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons and GT1–7 cells. In hypothalamic GnRH neurons, the frequency of AP firing increased from the control of 0.3 ± 0.04 Hz to 1.3 ± 0.2 (p < 0.01; n = 20) during LH treatment (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively). In GT1–7 neurons, LH treatment also initially increased AP firing from 2.0 ± 0.3 Hz basal to 3.7 ± 0.4 Hz (p < 0.01; n = 20; Fig. 1, I and J, respectively). In contrast, prolonged LH treatment for up to 10 min significantly reduced AP firing frequency in both native GnRH neurons (0.3 ± 0.04 Hz basal versus 0.14 ± 0.02 Hz LH treatment; p < 0.01; n = 20; Fig. 1G) and GT1–7 neurons (2.0 ± 0.3 Hz basal versus 0.5 ± 0.03 Hz LH treatment; p < 0.01; n = 20; Fig. 1K). These LH-induced changes in AP firing were reversible, and basal firing resumed in both cell types during the washout period (Fig. 1, H, L, and M). Consistent with Gi/o coupling of the LH/hCG receptors expressed in native hypothalamic GnRH neurons, pretreatment with 200 ng/ml PTX for 4 h prevented the time-dependent inhibition of AP firing and instead caused a sustained increase in AP firing and GnRH secretion. The rate of AP firing increased from 0.3 ± 0.05 Hz, PTX alone to 0.7 ± 0.06 Hz PTX + LH (1.5 min; p < 0.01, n = 12, Fig. 1O) and fell to 1.4 ± 0.12 Hz during prolonged treatment (p < 0.01, n = 10, Fig. 1P). During the washout period, AP firing frequency returned to the basal level (Fig. 1R). The roles of increased cAMP production in neurosecretion and electrical activity were also examined in cultured hypothalamic cells during treatment with forskolin in the absence and presence of hCG. In static cultures, direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin caused a monotonic and time-dependent increase in GnRH release. In contrast, treatment with hCG caused an initial increase, followed by a marked decrease during sustained treatment (Fig. 2A). Production of cAMP also showed a monotonic increase during treatment with forskolin (Fig. 2B). In contrast to GnRH release, cAMP production remained continuously elevated during combined treatment with hCG and forskolin, indicating that inhibition of GnRH release is mediated by mechanisms that are not primarily dependent on cAMP production (Fig. 2B). Patch-clamp recordings from identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons showed that treatment with 10 μm forskolin caused a time-dependent and sustained increase in AP firing. The frequency of AP firing increased from the control of 0.3 ± 0.02 to 0.9 ± 0.04 Hz during initial stimulation (Fig. 2, C and D, respectively, p < 0.01; n = 20). This persisted during prolonged treatment (Fig. 2E, p < 0.01; n = 10), and the AP firing rate returned to the control level during washout (Fig. 2F). The forskolin-induced increase in AP firing (Fig. 2, G and H) was markedly inhibited during concomitant treatment with LH, with a decrease from 2.1 ± 0.3 Hz forskolin treated to 0.4 ± 0.06 Hz (p < 0.01, n = 8) (Fig. 2, H and I). The increased rate of AP firing was restored during further treatment with forskolin (Fig. 2J). The Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, also caused a sustained increase in AP firing in identified GnRH neurons (Fig. 2, K–N). In contrast, selective activation of the Gi-coupled 5HT1 receptor by PAPP inhibited the rate of AP firing in hypothalamic GnRH neurons (Fig. 2, O–S). Identification of G Proteins Coupled to LH Receptors in GT1–7 Neurons—Western blot analysis of membrane preparations and cytosolic fractions from GT1–7 cells with specific antibodies to Gαs and Gαi3 revealed significant changes in the cellular distribution of activated G protein α-subunits during hCG treatment. Membrane-bound Gαs immunoreactivity was significantly reduced after treatment with hCG for 30 min (5.2 ± 0.6 in control versus 2.76 ± 0.2 in hCG treated, n = 3, p < 0.05, Fig. 3A). In contrast, cytosolic Gαs increased during hCG treatment, consistent with the agonist-induced redistribution of activated G protein subunits (0.7 ± 0.08 in control versus 1.76 ± 0.2 in hCG treated, n = 3, p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). After prolonged exposure (4 h) to 2 nm hCG, membrane-bound Gαi3 immunoreactivity decreased (3.9 ± 0.4 in control versus 2.2 ± 0.3 in hCG treated, n = 3, p < 0.05, Fig. 3C) and cytosolic immunoreactivity increased, consistent with the time-dependent reduction in cAMP production (0.54 ± 0.06 in control versus 1.46 ± 0.2 in hCG treated, n = 3, p < 0.05, Fig. 3D). The specificity of G protein α subunit antibodies was validated by blotting recombinant G protein α subunit standards with the corresponding antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3E, the immunoreactive Gαs signal increased in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, dose-dependent increases in Gαs immunoreactivity were observed during incubation of Gαs antibody with increasing amounts of cell membrane proteins derived from GT1–7 cells (Fig. 3F). For further validation of the Gαs and Gαi3 antibodies, GT1–7 cells were treated with toxins that selectively stimulate Gαs and inhibit Gαi3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3G, membrane-bound Gαs immunoreactivity probed with Gαs antibody was significantly reduced during treatment with cholera toxin (1 ng/ml, 4 h) to stimulate Gs, but was unchanged during treatment with PTX (Fig. 3G). In contrast, membrane-bound Gαi3 immunoreactivity probed with Gαi3 antibody was significantly increased during treatment PTX (200 ng/ml, 4 h). However, treatment with CTX had no effect on Gαi3 immunoreactivity (Fig. 3H). Expression of GIRK mRNAs in GT1–7 Neurons—RT-PCR analysis of total RNA derived from cultured GT1–7 neurons using gene-specific primers based on sequences of GIRK channels subunits gave the expected fragment sizes of 321 for GIRK1 (Fig. 4A), 347 for GIRK2 (Fig. 4B), 431 for GIRK3 (Fig. 4C), and 315 for GIRK4 (Fig. 4D) base pairs. No such products were obtained in the absence of reverse-transcribed mRNA, indicating that the RNA preparation was free of genomic DNA contamination. Voltage-step commands (–160 to –20 mV; 200 ms) delivered to identified hypothalamic GnRH neurons were used to elicit GIRK currents. The magnitude of the basal GIRK current was hyperpolarization-dependent, and was maximal at a test potential of –160 mV (Fig. 4, E and F, n = 5). The GIRK currents decreased in a hyperpolarization-dependent manner and were close to zero at –40 mV (Fig. 4, E and F). Treatment of identified GnRH neurons with 2 nm LH during the voltage ramp caused a substantial rise in GIRK current, which increased by 102.6 ± 12.6% (p < 0.01; n = 5) for all voltage steps negative to potassium equilibrium (Fig. 4, E and F). During the washout period the GIRK current fell almost to the basal level (Fig. 4, E and F). In all cells, the hyperpolarizing component of the K+ current was significantly reduced (p < 0.03; n = 5) when Ba2+ (200 μm) was added to the perfusion medium, consistent with its identity as a GIRK current (Fig. 4, E and F). Pretreatment of identified GnRH neurons with PTX (200 ng/ml) for 4 h had no significant effect on the basal GIRK current elicited by voltage-step potentials (Fig. 4, G and H, n = 5). In contrast, the LH-induced increase in GIRK current was prevented by prior treatment with PTX, indicating that βγ subunits Gi/o proteins mediate the significant increase in GIRK current of identified GnRH neurons (Fig. 4, G and H). The G protein-coupled LHR is highly expressed in the testis and ovary, and has been extensively studied in several mammalian species including rodents, ungulates, primates, and humans. LHRs have also been identified in several tissues that are not recognized as primary gonadotropin target sites, such as uterus, placenta, fallopian tubes, uterine vessels, umbilical cord, brain, and lymphocytes (18Lukacs H. Hiatt E.S. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Horm. Behav. 1995; 29: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Dufau M.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 461-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The LHR is primarily coupled to Gs and on activation stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity and cAMP production. In addition to Gs coupling, in some tissues the agonist-activated LHR also couples to Gi/o leading to inhibition of cAMP production (11Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and/or activation of phospholipase C (20Gudermann T. Birnbaumer M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

The hypothalamic expression of LHR, as well as the presence of measurable quantities of bioactive LH, indicate that LH originating by local production (22Emanuele N. Anderson J. Baker G. McDonald D.

https://openalex.org/W1969143419,"Abstract Disulfide bond catalysis is an essential component of protein biogenesis in the secretory pathway, from yeast through to man. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) catalyzes the oxidation and isomerization of disulfide bonds and is re-oxidized by an endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase (ERO). The elucidation of ERO function was greatly aided by the genetic analysis of two ero mutants, whose impairment results from point mutations in the FAD binding domain of the Ero protein. The ero1-1 and ero1-2 yeast strains have conditional and dithiothreitol-sensitive phenotypes, but the effects of the mutations on the behavior of Ero proteins has not been reported. Here, we show that these Gly to Ser and His to Tyr mutations do not prevent the dimerization of Ero1β or the non-covalent interaction of Ero1β with PDI. However, the Gly to Ser mutation abolishes disulfide-dependent PDI-Ero1β heterodimers. Both the Gly to Ser and His to Tyr mutations make Ero1β susceptible to misoxidation and aggregation, particularly during a temperature or redox stress. We conclude that the Ero FAD binding domain is critical for conformational stability, allowing Ero proteins to withstand stress conditions that cause client proteins to misfold."
