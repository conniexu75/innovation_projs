https://openalex.org/W2010118966,"Previous high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) observations of the carbon nanotubes have led to a ""Russian doll"" structural model that is based on hollow concentric cylinders capped at both ends. The structures of the carbon nanotubes and particles were characterized here by bulk physical and chemical property measurements. The individual nanostructure is as compressible as graphite in the c axis, and such nanostructures can be intercalated with potassium and rubidium, leading to a saturation composition of ""MC(8)."" These results are counter to expectations that are based on a Russian doll structure. HREM after intercalation with potassium and deintercalation indicates that individual nanoparticles are a ""paper-mache"" of smaller graphite layers. Direct current magnetization and electron spin resonance measurements indicate that the electronic properties of the nanostructures are distinctly different from those of graphite. Although the nanostructures have distinct morphologies and electronic properties, they are highly defective and have a local structure similar to turbostratic graphite."

These chemical series reveal a record of change in the relative size and intensity of the circulation system that transported air masses to Greenland [defined here as the polar circulation index (PCI)] and in the extent of ocean ice cover. Massive iceberg discharge events previously defined from the marine record are correlated with notable expansions of ocean ice cover and increases in PCI. During stadials without discharge events, ocean ice cover appears to reach some common maximum level. The massive aerosol loadings and dramatic variations in ocean ice cover documented in ice cores should be included in climate modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2065295334,"There is a difference between adhesion at the molecular level and adhesion in engineering. There is no doubt that molecules of solid materials stick together and can be separated mechanically. The problem is explaining the connection between molecular attractions and mechanical measurements. False ideas such as keying and gluing require critical assessment because they confuse molecules and mechanics. Mechanisms such as adhesive hysteresis, stringing, and clustering deserve evaluation. A rational theory of these phenomena should be based on the theoretical concept of reversible work of adhesion and on the measured quantity of adhesive energy, which includes the extra energy required to restructure the interface as surfaces move."
https://openalex.org/W2023705221,"Systems that use light as a carrier of information
offer the possibility of extremely
high speed processing, transmission, and
storage of data. Many such photonic systems
require high-performance nonlinear
optical (NLO) materials (1, 2), particularly
those exhibiting second-order NLO effects,
which occur only in molecules and materials
lacking a center of symmetry (1). Certain
conjugated organic molecules have
been known to exhibit substantial second order
optical nonlinearities, and recently,
successful approaches to optimization of
these properties by rational modification of
molecular structure have been demonstrated.
However, achieving the required
noncentrosymmetric order has in the past
been a major obstacle to the synthesis of
materials with large nonlinearities because
the large majority of nonchiral organic
compounds crystallize in centrosymmetric
space groups."
https://openalex.org/W2040780526,"The transition from rest to sliding contact of atomically smooth solids separated by molecularly thin liquid films was studied. The films could be deformed nearly reversibly to a large fraction of the film thickness. The modulus of elasticity and yield stress were low, considerably less than for a molecular crystal or glass in the bulk. The transition to dissipative sliding was typically (but not always) discontinuous. The dissipative stress was then nearly velocity-independent. The similar response of monolayers strongly attached to the solid surfaces, presenting a well-defined interface for sliding, suggests that the physical mechanism of sliding may involve wall slip."

Scientific and technological opportunities exist for the development of diamond-coated metal alloys and for a better understanding of adhesion mechanisms of hard, brittle coatings. An indentation method of wide applicability for measuring the adhesion of such coatings is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2091250935,"A GaAs-based transistor, analogous to commercial silicon devices, has been fabricated with vapor-deposited cubic GaS as the insulator material. The n-channel, depletion mode, GaAs field-effect transistor shows, in addition to classical transistor characteristics, a channel mobility of 4665.6 square centimeters per volt per second, an interfacial trap density of 10(11) per electron volt per square centimeter, and a transconductance of 7 millisiemens for a 5-micrometer gate length at a gate voltage of 8 volts. Furthermore, the GaAs transistor shows an on-to-off resistance ratio comparable to that of commercial devices."
https://openalex.org/W1973440662,"The short-term, seasonal input of ground water to a small, precipitation-dominated oligotrophic lake in northern Wisconsin amounts to less than 10 percent of the annual water budget of the lake but accounts for nearly all the external silica loading. Silica is a necessary nutrient for diatoms. A large spring diatom bloom occurs coincident with high silica inputs from ground water when other possible silica sources are low. The mass budgets of ground water and silica in the lake system demonstrate the importance of ground-water solute inputs to the lake."
https://openalex.org/W2164402178,"Useful compounds, whether produced by chemical synthesis or biological synthesis, often need to be purified from complex mixtures. Biochemists and chemists thus recognize the need for efficient new preparative purification techniques for product recovery. Such fractionation techniques must have high capacity and high resolution. In a novel group of separation methods suited to the preparative fractionation of proteins, antibiotics, and other classes of compounds, the chromatographic flow of a solute down the column is opposed by solute electrophoresis in the opposite direction. Useful separation is achieved when these two counteracting forces drive the solute to a unique equilibrium position within the separation chamber. The properties of chromatographic matrices, for example, gel-permeation matrices of various porosities, provide a means of establishing the unique equilibrium points. Extraordinary resolution and capacity are attainable by these methods."

https://openalex.org/W1993377534,"Six distinctive types of fossiliferous marine deposits occur on the Gal√°dpagos Islands that provide evidence for the age of emergence of the islands above sea level and hence a maximum age for the islands' terrestrial biota. These subtidal to supratidal deposits include (i) volcanic tuffs with fossils, (ii) limestones and sandstones interbedded with basalt, (iii) terrace deposits, (iv) beach rock, (v) supratidal talus deposits, and (vi) recently uplifted tidal and subtidal rocks and sand. With the exception of (vi), the deposits were previously assigned ages varying from Miocene to Pleistocene, but all are less than about 2 million years old. This age, together with independently determined geologic ages, indicate that the islands emerged from the sea relatively recently and that all evolution of the islands' unique terrestrial biota occurred within the past 3 to 4 million years."

https://openalex.org/W2061743785,"Diploid and diploid-triploid mosaic individuals of Platemys platycephala were found in natural populations. In mosaic specimens, the blood, spleen, liver, and testis contained both diploid and triploid cells. The ratio of triploid to diploid cells was more variable among individuals than among somatic tissues within an individual. Only diploid cells underwent meiosis in males; haploid gametes were produced. There appears to be geographic variation for mosaicism in that only diploids were found in Bolivia, whereas diploids and diploid-triploid mosaics occured in Surinam."

https://openalex.org/W1972152900,"An x-ray projection microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device camera allows direct observation of zinc (Zn(2+)) ions diffusing in aqueous hydrochloric acid solution during the corrosion of zinc foil and pellets. Time series of microradiographic images with a lateral resolution on the order of 10 micrometers allow observation of the time and spatial evolution of the colorless Zn(2+) ions in solution without any previous treatment. The concentration distribution of the ions can be quantified from these images. This technique should find applications in the biology, chemistry, and electrochemistry of aqueous solutions, allowing direct observation of the behavior and concentration fluctuations of medium or heavy ions moving in a weakly absorbing medium."
