https://openalex.org/W2027994431,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have emerged as a serious threat to human and animal health. Bdellovibrio spp. and Micavibrio spp. are Gram-negative bacteria that prey on other Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the ability of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and Micavibrio aeruginosavorus to prey on MDR Gram-negative clinical strains was examined. Although the potential use of predatory bacteria to attack MDR pathogens has been suggested, the data supporting these claims is lacking. By conducting predation experiments we have established that predatory bacteria have the capacity to attack clinical strains of a variety of ß-lactamase-producing, MDR Gram-negative bacteria. Our observations indicate that predatory bacteria maintained their ability to prey on MDR bacteria regardless of their antimicrobial resistance, hence, might be used as therapeutic agents where other antimicrobial drugs fail."
https://openalex.org/W2044317336,"We previously established that overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is sufficient to induce tumor formation by otherwise nontransformed mammary epithelial cells, and that the initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is capable of increasing the invasion and metastasis of these cells. Using this breast cancer (BC) model, we find that in addition to EGF, adhesion to fibronectin (FN) activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) through EGFR-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Importantly, EMT facilitated a signaling switch from SRC-dependent EGFR:STAT3 signaling in pre-EMT cells to EGFR-independent FN:JAK2:STAT3 signaling in their post-EMT counterparts, thereby sensitizing these cells to JAK2 inhibition. Accordingly, human metastatic BC cells that failed to activate STAT3 downstream of EGFR did display robust STAT3 activity upon adhesion to FN. Furthermore, FN enhanced outgrowth in three-dimensional organotypic cultures via a mechanism that is dependent upon β1 integrin, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and STAT3 but not EGFR. Collectively, our data demonstrate that matrix-initiated signaling is sufficient to drive STAT3 activation, a reaction that is facilitated by EMT during BC metastatic progression."

Current views on its pathophysiology, such as faulty sensorimotor integration and impaired motor planning, are largely based on studies of focal hand dystonia. Using resting state fMRI, we explored whether cervical dystonia patients have altered functional brain connectivity compared to healthy controls, by investigating 10 resting state networks. Scans were repeated immediately before and some weeks after botulinum toxin injections to see whether connectivity abnormalities were restored. We here show that cervical dystonia patients have reduced connectivity in selected regions of the prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex and superior parietal lobule within a distributed network that comprises the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, primary sensorimotor cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex (sensorimotor network). With regard to a network originating from the occipital cortex (primary visual network), selected regions in the prefrontal and premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, and middle temporal gyrus areas have reduced connectivity. In selected regions of the prefrontal, premotor, primary motor and early visual cortex increased connectivity was found within a network that comprises the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate cortex and parietal cortex (executive control network). Botulinum toxin treatment resulted in a partial restoration of connectivity abnormalities in the sensorimotor and primary visual network. These findings demonstrate the involvement of multiple neural networks in cervical dystonia. The reduced connectivity within the sensorimotor and primary visual networks may provide the neural substrate to expect defective motor planning and disturbed spatial cognition. Increased connectivity within the executive control network suggests excessive attentional control and while this may be a primary trait, perhaps contributing to abnormal motor control, this may alternatively serve a compensatory function in order to reduce the consequences of the motor planning defect inflicted by the other network abnormalities."

Histone modifications, such as reversible acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination, which collectively contribute to the establishment of distinct chromatin states, play important roles in the recruitment of repair factors to the sites of double-strand breaks. Here we report that histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1), a classical B type histone acetyltransferase responsible for acetylating the N-terminal tail of newly synthesized histone H4 in the cytoplasm, is a key regulator of DNA repair by homologous recombination in the nucleus. We found that HAT1 is required for the incorporation of H4K5/K12-acetylated H3.3 at sites of double-strand breaks through its HIRA-dependent histone turnover activity. Incorporated histones with specific chemical modifications facilitate subsequent recruitment of RAD51, a key repair factor in mammalian cells, to promote efficient homologous recombination. Significantly, depletion of HAT1 sensitized cells to DNA damage compromised the global chromatin structure, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W2007643437,"The western Amazon continues to be an active and controversial zone of hydrocarbon exploration and production. We argue for the urgent need to implement best practices to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts associated with the sector. Here, we present a three-part study aimed at resolving the major obstacles impeding the advancement of best practice in the region. Our focus is on Loreto, Peru, one of the largest and most dynamic hydrocarbon zones in the Amazon. First, we develop a set of specific best practice guidelines to address the lack of clarity surrounding the issue. These guidelines incorporate both engineering-based criteria and key ecological and social factors. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of existing and planned hydrocarbon activities and infrastructure, overcoming the lack of information that typically hampers large-scale impact analysis. Third, we evaluate the planned activities and infrastructure with respect to the best practice guidelines. We show that Loreto is an extremely active hydrocarbon front, highlighted by a number of recent oil and gas discoveries and a sustained government push for increased exploration. Our analyses reveal that the use of technical best practice could minimize future impacts by greatly reducing the amount of required infrastructure such as drilling platforms and access roads. We also document a critical need to consider more fully the ecological and social factors, as the vast majority of planned infrastructure overlaps sensitive areas such as protected areas, indigenous territories, and key ecosystems and watersheds. Lastly, our cost analysis indicates that following best practice does not impose substantially greater costs than conventional practice, and may in fact reduce overall costs. Barriers to the widespread implementation of best practice in the Amazon clearly exist, but our findings show that there can be great benefits to its implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2092530852,"After cardiac ischemia and reperfusion or reoxygenation (I/R), damaged mitochondria propagate tissue injury by promoting cell death. One possible mechanism to protect from I/R-induced injury is the elimination of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. Here we identify new molecular events that lead to mitophagy using a cell culture model and whole hearts subjected to I/R. We found that I/R induces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) association with mitochondria and promotes direct uptake of damaged mitochondria into multiorganellar lysosomal-like (LL) structures for elimination independently of the macroautophagy pathway. We also found that protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) inhibits GAPDH-driven mitophagy by phosphorylating the mitochondrially associated GAPDH at threonine 246 following I/R. Phosphorylated GAPDH promotes the accumulation of mitochondria at the periphery of LL structures, which coincides with increased mitochondrial permeability. Either inhibition of PKCδ or expression of a phosphorylation-defective GAPDH mutant during I/R promotes a reduction in mitochondrial mass and apoptosis, thus indicating rescued mitophagy. Taken together, we identified a GAPDH/PKCδ signaling switch, which is activated during oxidative stress to regulate the balance between cell survival by mitophagy and cell death due to accumulation of damaged mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1975500320,"The gut microbiota is important in maintaining human health, but numerous factors have the potential to alter its composition. Our aim was to examine the impact of a standard bowel preparation on the intestinal microbiota using two different techniques. Fifteen subjects undergoing colonoscopy consumed a bowel preparation comprised of 10 mg bisacodyl and 2 L polyethylene glycol. The microbiota of stool samples, collected one month before, one week before (pre-colonoscopy), and one week, one month, and three to six months after colonoscopy (post-colonoscopy) was evaluated. Two samples were taken three to six months apart from five healthy subjects who did not undergo colonoscopy. Universal primers targeting the V2–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene were used to PCR amplify all samples for denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Pre- and post-colonoscopy samples were compared using Dice’s similarity coefficients. Three samples from ten subjects who underwent colonoscopy, and both samples from the five subjects who didn’t, were used for high-throughput sequencing of the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Samples were curated and analysed in Mothur. Results of the DGGE analyses show that the fecal microbiota of a small number of subjects had short-term changes. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that the variation between the samples of subjects who underwent colonoscopy was no greater than the variation observed between samples from subjects who did not. We conclude that bowel preparation does not have a lasting effect on the composition of the intestinal microbiota for the majority of subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1991307332,"Accumulation of misfolded proteins in cellular compartments can result in stress-induced cell death. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ER-associated degradation clears aberrant proteins from the secretory pathway. In the cytoplasm and nucleus, this job is left to the cytoplasmic quality control (CytoQC) machinery. Both processes utilize chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome system to aid in protein elimination. Previous studies in yeast have drawn comparisons between these processes using data from structurally and topologically different substrates. We sought to draw a direct comparison between ERAD and CytoQC by studying the elimination of a single misfolded domain that, depending on its residence, is disposed by either of these pathways. The truncated, second nucleotide binding domain (NBD2*) from a yeast ERAD substrate, Ste6p*, resides at the cytoplasmic face of the ER. We show that a soluble form of NBD2* is cytoplasmic and unlike wild-type NBD2 is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. In contrast to Ste6p*, which employs the ER-localized Doa10p ubiquitin ligase, NBD2* is ubiquitinated by a nuclear E3 ligase San1p, a factor that is also required for its degradation. Although the yeast cytoplasmic Hsp70 chaperone, Ssa1p, has been thought to facilitate the nuclear import or to maintain the solubility of most CytoQC substrates, we discovered that Ssa1p facilitates the interaction between San1p and NBD2*, demonstrating that chaperones can aid in substrate recognition and San1p-dependent protein degradation.

https://openalex.org/W1997110756,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have strong effects on hibernation and daily torpor. Increased dietary uptake of PUFA of the n-6 class, particularly of Linoleic acid (LA, C18:2 n-6) lengthens torpor bout duration and enables animals to reach lower body temperatures (Tb) and metabolic rates. As previously hypothesized, this well-known influence of PUFA may be mediated via effects of the membrane fatty acid composition on sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+−ATPase 2a (SERCA) in the heart of hibernators. We tested the hypotheses that high proportions of n-6 PUFA in general, or specifically high proportions of LA (C18:2 n-6) in SR phospholipids (PL) should be associated with increased cardiac SERCA activity, and should allow animals to reach lower minimum Tb in torpor. We measured activity of SERCA from hearts of hibernating and non-hibernating Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) in vitro at 35°C. Further, we determined the PL fatty acid composition of the SR membrane of these hearts. We found that SERCA activity strongly increased as the proportion of LA in SR PL increased but was negatively affected by the content of Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6 n-3). SR PL from hibernating hamsters were characterized by high proportions of LA and low proportions of DHA. As a result, SERCA activity was significantly higher during entrance into torpor and in torpor compared to inter-bout arousal. Also, animals with increased SERCA activity reached lower Tb during torpor. Interestingly, a subgroup of hamsters which never entered torpor but remained euthermic throughout winter displayed a phenotype similar to animals in summer. This was characterized by lower proportions of LA and increased proportions of DHA in SR membranes, which is apparently incompatible with torpor. We conclude that the PUFA composition of SR membranes affects cardiac function via modulating SERCA activity, and hence determines the minimum Tb tolerated by hibernators."
https://openalex.org/W2000320283,"Induction of type-I interferons (IFNs), IFN-α/β, is crucial to innate immunity against RNA virus infection. Cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), are critical pathogen sensors for activation of type-I IFN expression in response to RNA virus infection. MDA5 is required for type-I IFN expression in mouse models in response to infection by picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and coxsackievirus B3. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) belongs to picornaviridae and contains positive-stranded RNA genome that is linked with VPg protein at the 5′ end. Although a recent study showed that EV71 3C protease could suppress RIG-I-mediated IFN-β response, the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptor that is directly involved in the recognition of EV71 RNA remains unclear. Using EV71-derived RNA as an agonist, we demonstrate that MDA5 is involved in EV71 RNA-mediated IRF3 activation and IFN-β transcription. Our data also show that overexpression of the MDA5 protein reverses the suppression of IRF3 activation caused by EV71 infection. These results indicate that MDA5 is an important factor for EV71 RNA-activated type-I IFN expression. Furthermore, we also show that EV71 infection enhances MDA5 degradation and that the degradation could be inhibited by a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2029040255,"How we compute time is not fully understood. Questions include whether an automatic brain mechanism is engaged in temporally regular environmental structure in order to anticipate events, and whether this can be dissociated from task-related processes, including response preparation, selection and execution. To investigate these issues, a passive temporal oddball task requiring neither time-based motor response nor explicit decision was specifically designed and delivered to participants during high-density, event-related potentials recording. Participants were presented with pairs of audiovisual stimuli (S1 and S2) interspersed with an Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) that was manipulated according to an oddball probabilistic distribution. In the standard condition (70% of trials), the ISI lasted 1,500 ms, while in the two alternative, deviant conditions (15% each), it lasted 2,500 and 3,000 ms. The passive over-exposition to the standard ISI drove participants to automatically and progressively create an implicit temporal expectation of S2 onset, reflected by the time course of the Contingent Negative Variation response, which always peaked in correspondence to the point of S2 maximum expectation and afterwards inverted in polarity towards the baseline. Brain source analysis of S1- and ISI-related ERP activity revealed activation of sensorial cortical areas and the supplementary motor area (SMA), respectively. In particular, since the SMA time course synchronised with standard ISI, we suggest that this area is the major cortical generator of the temporal CNV reflecting an automatic, action-independent mechanism underlying temporal expectancy."
https://openalex.org/W2145151839,"Selenoprotein P (Sepp1) is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis for its selenium. The other extracellular selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase-3 (Gpx3), has not been shown to transport selenium. Mice with genetic alterations of Sepp1, the Sepp1 receptors apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2) and megalin, and Gpx3 were used to investigate maternalfetal selenium transfer. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) showed receptor-independent uptake of Sepp1 and Gpx3 in the same vesicles of d-13 visceral yolk sac cells, suggesting uptake by pinocytosis. ICC also showed apoER2-mediated uptake of maternal Sepp1 in the d-18 placenta. Thus, two selenoprotein-dependent maternalfetal selenium transfer mechanisms were identified. Selenium was quantified in d-18 fetuses with the mechanisms disrupted. Maternal Sepp1 deletion, which lowers maternal whole-body selenium, decreased fetal selenium under selenium-adequate conditions but deletion of fetal apoER2 did not. Fetal apoER2 deletion did decrease fetal selenium, by 51%, under selenium-deficient conditions, verifying function of the placental Sepp1-apoER2 mechanism. Maternal Gpx3 deletion decreased fetal selenium, by 13%, but only under selenium-deficient conditions. These findings indicate that the selenoprotein uptake mechanisms ensure selenium transfer to the fetus under selenium-deficient conditions. The failure of their disruptions (apoER2 deletion, Gpx3 deletion) to affect fetal selenium under selenium-adequate conditions indicates the existence of an additional maternal-fetal selenium transfer mechanism.—Burk, R. F., Olson, G. E., Hill, K. E., Winfrey, V. P., Motley, A. K., and Kurokawa, S., Maternal-fetal transfer of selenium in the mouse. FASEB J. 27, 3249–3256 (2013). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2095571122,"Following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, a large tsunami developed and struck the Pacific coast of eastern Japan. To assess the immediate impacts of the tsunami on coastal communities, changes in taxon composition and richness of macrobenthic animals before and after the tsunami were examined at nine intertidal flats in Sendai Bay and the Sanriku Ria coast. The results showed that 30–80% of taxa indigenously inhabiting intertidal flats disappeared after the tsunami. Among animal types, endobenthic and sessile epibenthic animals were more vulnerable to the tsunami than mobile epibenthic animals like shore crabs and snails. For all the intertidal flats examined, animals that were originally dwellers in lower tidal zones and not recorded before the tsunami were also found right after the tsunami, indicating that the tsunami not only took away many benthic taxa from the intertidal flats but also brought in some taxa from elsewhere. However, overall changes in taxon community composition were greater for intertidal flats that experienced larger inundation heights. These results showed that the ecological impacts of the tsunami were proportional to the physical impacts as gauged by wave height and that mobile epibenthic animals were less vulnerable to the tsunami."

The developmental role of this gene remains unexplored. To understand the biological function(s) of zebrafish dyx1c1 during embryonic development, we cloned the zebrafish dyx1c1 and used morpholino-based knockdown strategy. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the presence of dyx1c1 transcripts in embryos, early larval stages and in a wide range of adult tissues. Using mRNA in situ hybridization, we show here that dyx1c1 is expressed in many ciliated tissues in zebrafish. Inhibition of dyx1c1 produced pleiotropic phenotypes characteristically associated with cilia defects such as body curvature, hydrocephalus, situs inversus and kidney cysts. We also demonstrate that in dyx1c1 morphants, cilia length is reduced in several organs including Kupffer’s vesicle, pronephros, spinal canal and olfactory placode. Furthermore, electron microscopic analysis of cilia in dyx1c1 morphants revealed loss of both outer (ODA) and inner dynein arms (IDA) that have been shown to be required for cilia motility.

The FN-collagen interaction is well documented (14Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar), but its molecular details have remained elusive until recently. It has long been known that FN is crucial for fibroblast attachment to collagen matrices (15Kleinman H.K. McGoodwin E.B.

Collagen fibrillogenesis: fibronectin, integrins, and minor collagens as organizers and nucleators.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In vitro, however, 6FnI1–2FnII7–9FnI binds strongly to gelatin, the denatured form of collagen (18Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Binding of soluble form of fibroblast surface protein, fibronectin, to collagen.Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar, 19Dessau W. Adelmann B.C. Timpl R.

J. 1978; 169: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but not to triple-helical collagen fibrils; 6FnI1–2FnII7–9FnI was thus named the “gelatin-binding domain” (GBD). To reconcile the in vitro and cellular findings, it was suggested that the physiological function of the FN-collagen interaction is related to clearance of denatured collagenous material during wound repair (20Blumenstock F.A.

New functions for the matrix metalloproteinases in cancer progression.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5113) Google Scholar). However, recent work suggested that the collagen triple helix unfolds locally at physiological temperatures (23Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Type I collagen is thermally unstable at body temperature.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 24Fiori S. Saccà B. Moroder L.

Biol. 2002; 319: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which suggested the possibility that FN could also interact with unwound collagen in intact fibers. Previous work from our laboratory revealed that FN binds tightly to a consensus sequence on D-period 4 of the collagen type I α1 and α2 chains (26Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Identification and structural analysis of type I collagen sites in complex with fibronectin fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), just C-terminal of the MMP-1 cleavage site (27Iyer S. Visse R. Nagase H. Acharya K.R. Crystal structure of an active form of human MMP-1.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of the complex between an α1 peptide from this site and 8–9FnI revealed that the collagen peptide extends the 8FnI antiparallel β-sheet by one strand (26Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Identification and structural analysis of type I collagen sites in complex with fibronectin fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Campbell I.D. Potts J.R. Pathogenic bacteria attach to human fibronectin through a tandem β-zipper.Nature. 2003; 423: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that 8–9FnI can unwind triple-helical peptides from the same site in a concentration dependent manner (26Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Identification and structural analysis of type I collagen sites in complex with fibronectin fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). What is the role of the remaining GBD modules? We recently proposed a composite GBD model from the isolated crystallographic structures of 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI and 8–9FnI (7Erat M.C. Schwarz-Linek U. Pickford A.R. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Implications for collagen binding from the crystallographic structure of fibronectin 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and suggested that a suitably long collagen peptide could bind cooperatively to these two GBD subfragments, thereby offering better affinity compared with isolated 8–9FnI binding (26Erat M.C. Slatter D.A. Lowe E.D. Millard C.J. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Identification and structural analysis of type I collagen sites in complex with fibronectin fragments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This model was markedly different from a crystal structure of the GBD in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Zn2+, which showed a dimeric conformation that impaired collagen binding (30Graille M. Pagano M. Rose T. Ravaux M.R. van Tilbeurgh H. Zinc induces structural reorganization of gelatin binding domain from human fibronectin and affects collagen binding.Structure. 2010; 18: 710-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we show that four collagen type I sites bind the GBD with broadly similar affinities, although only one displays a cooperative interaction involving all GBD modules. Ensemble analysis of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data showed that the GBD adopts a monomeric conformation in solution, which is further stabilized by collagen peptide binding. Our findings demonstrate how FN fragments form unique functionally competent multidomain units, allowing FN to act as a versatile protein interaction hub in the extracellular matrix (31Vakonakis I. Campbell I.D. Extracellular matrix: from atomic resolution to ultrastructure.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FN fragments corresponding to residues 305–608 (GBD), 305–515 (6FnI1–2FnII7FnI), and 516–608 (8–9FnI) and bearing single amino acid substitutions to improve solubility and protein yields (H307D, N528Q, and R534K) were produced as described previously (7Erat M.C.

Open table in a new tab NMR spectrometers used superconducting magnets (Oxford Instruments) at 950- and 500-MHz proton resonance frequencies (home-built or Bruker AVANCE II consoles and room temperature or cryogenic probe heads, respectively). Spectra were recorded in PBS (20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) and 150 mm NaCl) with 1% 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid as a calibration standard. Experiment temperatures were optimized to avoid resonance broadening due to intermediate exchange phenomena and corresponded to 25 °C (8–9FnI) or 37 °C (6FnI1–2FnII7FnI). Sequential chemical shift assignments were performed earlier (7Erat M.C. Schwarz-Linek U. Pickford A.R. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I.

Analysis of spectral perturbations upon protein interactions and determination of equilibrium parameters were performed as described (33Vakonakis I. Langenhan T. Prömel S. Russ A. Campbell I.D.

Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed at 25 °C in PBS using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) and PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) fluorometers. Samples of 75 nm labeled peptide and increasing concentrations of protein in 96-well plates were excited at 485 nm with a 515-nm cutoff, and fluorescence was observed at 538 nm. Differences in fluorescence polarization were fit using a single binding model in the program Origin (OriginLab) (33Vakonakis I. Langenhan T. Prömel S. Russ A. Campbell I.D.

Crystals of the 8–9FnI-AN collagen peptide complex were formed using the vapor diffusion method from sitting drops dispensed by a mosquito® Crystal robot (TPP Labtech). The drops consisted of 100 nl of an equimolar mixture of protein (15 mg/ml) and peptide AN in 10 mm HEPES and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) and 100 nl of reservoir solution containing 4.3 m NaCl and 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5). Crystals formed after 3 weeks at 20 °C. They were cryoprotected by transfer to reservoir solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol and flash-cooled. Data were collected at a resolution of 2.6 Å at beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Data were integrated with MOSFLM (34Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Processing diffraction data with MOSFLM.in: Read R.J. Sussman J.L. Evolving Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography.

Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (36Zwart P.H. Afonine P.V. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W.

Manual model building was performed in Coot (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). Water positions were manually identified from the electron density map in Coot. Interactions between 8–9FnI and the collagen peptide were analyzed using PDBePISA service from the European Bioinformatics Institute (39Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar). SAXS data were collected at BioSAXS beamline X33 of the Doris storage ring at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) at 20 °C and 0.15-nm wavelength. Samples in PBS were checked for monodispersity using dynamic light scattering prior to data collection. The GBD was measured at 3, 2, and 1 mg/ml concentrations. The complex of the GBD with collagen peptide C was measured at a 1:1 molar ratio using 42 μm (1.5 mg/ml) GBD. The collagen peptide C concentration was verified using an on-site refractometer. All samples were supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol just prior to data collection to avoid radiation damage. A fresh sample of BSA was measured as a standard. Buffer subtraction, intensity normalization, and data merging for the different sample concentrations were performed using PRIMUS (40Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: a Windows PC-based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Cryst. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2342) Google Scholar). The radii of gyration (Rg) were calculated with the AutoRg subroutine in PRIMUS, whereas Dmax values were calculated using autoGNOM (41Svergun D.I. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Cryst. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Determination of molecular model ensembles that best fit the SAXS data was performed using the ensemble optimization method (42Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I.

Quaternary structure modeling was done with SASREF (43Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. Global rigid body modeling of macromolecular complexes against small-angle scattering data.Biophys.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4195-4200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Back-calculation of scattering curves from known crystal structures was performed using CRYSOL (44Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL–a program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Cryst. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar). Collagen type I α1 and α2 numbering is taken to begin at the estimated start of the triple-helical region. This is equivalent to numbering in the UniProt database minus 178 residues for α1 and 90 residues for α2. “O” in peptide sequences denotes 4-hydroxyproline. FN residues correspond to UniProt entry B7ZLF0. The 8–9FnI-BN crystallographic model and data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 3GXE). Previously, NMR solution data indicated that FN modules do not undergo radical structural rearrangement in the complete GBD compared with its subfragments 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI and 8–9FnI (7Erat M.C. Schwarz-Linek U. Pickford A.R. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Implications for collagen binding from the crystallographic structure of fibronectin 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI.J. Biol.

We therefore proposed a GBD model composed of the two subfragment crystal structures, with an elongated linear arrangement of 7–9FnI protruding from the globular 6FnI1–2FnII (Fig. 1A) (7Erat M.C. Schwarz-Linek U. Pickford A.R. Farndale R.W. Campbell I.D. Vakonakis I. Implications for collagen binding from the crystallographic structure of fibronectin 6FnI1–2FnII7FnI.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33764-33770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test this model, we performed solution SAXS measurements. Three different concentrations of GBD at 3, 2, and 1 mg/ml yielded consistent scattering curves without any signs of aggregation (data not shown). Because of the higher signal/noise ratio, all further analysis was carried out with the data from the most concentrated sample using the ATSAS software package (45Petroukhov M.V. Konarev P.V. Kikhney A.G. Svergun D.I. ATSAS 2.1–towards automated and web-supported small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40: s223-s228Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Guinier analysis suggested a Rg of 3.45 nm and a zero angle intensity (I0) of 48.77 (Fig. 1B). Using BSA as a standard, we calculated a particle molecular mass of 43 kDa, which is within the method error range for a monomeric 35.2-kDa GBD. We then used CRYSOL (44Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL–a program to evaluate x-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Cryst. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2766) Google Scholar) to back-calculate the scattering curve from the composite GBD model, as well as monomeric and dimeric variants of the published GBD crystal structure (30Graille M. Pagano M. Rose T. Ravaux M.R. van Tilbeurgh H. Zinc induces structural reorganization of gelatin binding domain from human fibronectin and affects collagen binding.Structure. 2010; 18: 710-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). Comparison of the predicted scattering with the experimental data strongly favors the composite model, especially in the low angle part of the curve (χ = 2.2 versus χ = 6.7 for the crystallographic dimer and χ = 4.2 for the equivalent monomer). However, even our previous composite model does not adequately describe the GBD solution state as judged from the divergence of predicted and experimental scattering at high angles. Ensemble optimization analysis (42Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. Structural characterization of flexible proteins using small-angle x-ray scattering.J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2086596600,"Successful conservation plans are conditioned by our ability to detect anthropogenic change in space and time and various statistical analyses have been developed to handle this critical issue. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate a new approach for spatial analysis in conservation biology. Here, we propose a two-step protocol. First, we introduce a new disturbance metric which provides a continuous measure of disturbance for any focal communities on the basis of the surrounding landscape matrix. Second, we use this new gradient to estimate species and community disturbance thresholds by implementing a recently developed method called Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN). TITAN detects changes in species distributions along environmental gradients using indicators species analysis and assesses synchrony among species change points as evidence for community thresholds. We demonstrate our method with soil arthropod assemblages along a disturbance gradient in Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal). We show that our new disturbance metric realistically reflects disturbance patterns, especially in buffer zones (ecotones) between land use categories. By estimating species disturbance thresholds with TITAN along the disturbance gradient in Terceira, we show that species significantly associated with low disturbance differ from those associated with high disturbance in their biogeographical origin (endemics, non-endemic natives and exotics) and taxonomy (order). Finally, we suggest that mapping the disturbance community thresholds may reveal areas of primary interest for conservation, since these may host indigenous species sensitive to high disturbance levels. This new framework may be useful when: (1) both local and regional processes are to be reflected on single disturbance measures; (2) these are better quantified in a continuous gradient; (3) mapping disturbance of large regions using fine scales is necessary; (4) indicator species for disturbance are searched for and; (5) community thresholds are useful to understand the global dynamics of habitats."

HAMLET exerts a rather specific bactericidal activity against some respiratory pathogens, with highest activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but lacks activity against most other bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococci. Still, ion transport associated with death in S. pneumoniae is also detected to a lower degree in insensitive organisms. In this study we demonstrate that HAMLET acts as an antimicrobial adjuvant that can increase the activity of a broad spectrum of antibiotics (methicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin and erythromycin) against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, to a degree where they become sensitive to those same antibiotics, both in antimicrobial assays against planktonic and biofilm bacteria and in an in vivo model of nasopharyngeal colonization. We show that HAMLET exerts these effects specifically by dissipating the proton gradient and inducing a sodium-dependent calcium influx that partially depolarizes the plasma membrane, the same mechanism induced during pneumococcal death. These effects results in an increased cell associated binding and/or uptake of penicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, especially in resistant stains. Finally, HAMLET inhibits the increased resistance of methicillin seen under antibiotic pressure and the bacteria do not become resistant to the adjuvant, which is a major advantageous feature of the molecule. These results highlight HAMLET as a novel antimicrobial adjuvant with the potential to increase the clinical usefulness of antibiotics against drug resistant strains of S. aureus."
https://openalex.org/W1998337767,"Long-palate, lung and nasal epithelium clone 1 (LPLUNC1) gene expression is relatively tissue specific. It is highly expressed in nontumor nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues, but its expression is reduced in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), indicating that LPLUNC1 may be associated with the tumorigenesis of NPC. To study the effects of LPLUNC1 on NPC tumorigenesis, a full-length LPLUNC1 expression plasmid was stably transfected into the NPC cell line, 5-8F. Our data indicated that LPLUNC1 inhibited NPC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. LPLUNC1 also delayed cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and phosphorylated Rb. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of LPLUNC1 on NPC tumorigenesis, cDNA microarray was performed. These studies revealed that LPLUNC1 inhibited the expression of certain mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPK) kinases and cell cycle-related molecules. Western blotting confirmed that the expression of MEK1, phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated JNK1/2, c-Myc and c-Jun were inhibited by LPLUNC1. Furthermore, the transcriptional activity of AP-1 was down-regulated by LPLUNC1, suggesting that the MAPK signaling pathway is regulated by LPLUNC1. Taken together, the present study indicates that LPLUNC1 delays NPC cell growth by inhibiting the MAPK and cyclin D1/E2F pathways and suggests that LPLUNC1 may represent a promising candidate tumor suppressor gene associated with NPC."
https://openalex.org/W2150187417,"Background To investigate the WM microstructure deficits in heroin dependent individuals (HDIs) with different length of heroin dependence, and to investigate whether these WM deficits can be related to the duration of heroin use and to decision-making deficits in HDIs. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-six HDIs [including eighteen sHDIs (duration of heroin dependent is less than 10 years) and eighteen lHDIs (duration of dependent is between 10∼20 years)] and sixteen healthy controls participated in this study. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (Da) and radial diffusivity (Dr) were performed by tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to localize abnormal WM regions among groups. TBSS demonstrated that sHDIs had significantly lower FA than controls in right orbito-frontal WM, bilateral temporal WM and right parietal WM. The lHDIs had significantly lower FA throughout the brain compared with the controls and sHDIs. The lHDIs had significantly lower Da than controls in bilateral inferior frontaloccipital fasciculus, bilateral splenium of corpus callosum, left inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and had significantly higher Dr than controls in bilateral uncinatus fasciculus, bilateral inferior frontaloccipital fasciculus and bilateral cortical spinal fasciculus. Volume-of-interest (VOI) analyses detect the changes of diffusivity indices in the regions with FA abnormalities revealed by control vs sHDIs. In most VOIs, FA reductions were caused by the increase in Dr as well as the decrease in Da. Correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between FA and behavioral measures in HDIs and controls available. Significantly positively correlations were found between the FA values in the right orbital-frontal WM, right parietal WM and IGT performance. Conclusions The extent and severity of WM integrity deficits in HDIs was associated with the length of heroin dependent. Furthermore, abnormal WM microstructure may correlate with decision-making impairments in HDIs."
https://openalex.org/W1989142099,"Pathogens express ligands for several TLRs that may play a role in the induction or control of the inflammatory response during infection. Concerning Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, we have previously characterized glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored mucin-like glycoproteins (tGPI-mucin) and unmethylated CpG DNA sequences as TLR2 and TLR9 agonists, respectively. Here we sought to determine how these TLRs may modulate the inflammatory response in the following cell populations: F4/80(+)CD11b(+) (macrophages), F4/80(low)CD11b(+) (monocytes) and MHCII(+)CD11c(high) (dendritic cells). For this purpose, TLR2(-/-) and TLR9(-/-) mice were infected with Y strain of T. cruzi and different immunological parameters were evaluated. According to our previous data, a crucial role of TLR9 was evidenced in the establishment of Th1 response, whereas TLR2 appeared to act as immunoregulator in the early stage of infection. More precisely, we demonstrated here that TLR2 was mainly used by F4/80(+)CD11b(+) cells for the production of TNF-α. In the absence of TLR2, an increased production of IL-12/IL-23p40 and IFN-γ was noted suggesting that TLR2 negatively controls the Th1 response. In contrast, TLR9 was committed to IL-12/IL-23p40 production by MHCII(+)CD11c(high) cells that constitute the main source of IL-12/IL-23p40 during infection. Importantly, a down-regulation of TLR9 response was observed in F4/80(+)CD11b(+) and F4/80(low)CD11b(+) populations that correlated with the decreased TLR9 expression level in these cells. Interestingly, these cells recovered their capacity to respond to TLR9 agonist when MHCII(+)CD11c(high) cells were impeded from producing IL-12/IL-23p40, thereby indicating possible cross-talk between these populations. The differential use of TLR2 and TLR9 by the immune cells during the acute phase of the infection explains why TLR9- but not TLR2-deficient mice are susceptible to T. cruzi infection."
https://openalex.org/W2074008763,"Hepatitis C virus infection is closely related to lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), including mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) and some lymphomas. Modification of the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with different autoimmune diseases and/or LPDs. No data exist about the modifications in miRNA expression in HCV-associated LPDs. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression levels of a panel of miRNAs previously associated with autoimmune/LPDs in a large population of HCV patients with and without MC or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), to identify potential markers of evolution of HCV infection. PBMC expression of miR-Let-7d, miR-16, miR-21, miR-26b, miR-146a and miR-155 was evaluated by real-time PCR in 167 HCV patients (75 with MC [MC-HCV], 11 with HCV-associated NHL [NHL-HCV], 81 without LPD [HCV]) and in 35 healthy subjects (HS). A significant increase in miR-21 (p<0.001), miR-16 (p<0.01) and miR-155 (p<0.01) expression was detected in PBMCs from only NHL patients whereas a significant decrease in miR-26b was detected in both MC and NHL subjects (p<0.01) when compared to HS and HCV groups. A restoration of miR-26b levels was observed in the post-treatment PBMCs of 35 HCV-MC patients experiencing complete virological and clinical response following antiviral therapy. This study, for the first time, shows that specific microRNAs in PBMC from HCV patients who developed MC and/or NHL are modulated differently. The specific, reversible downregulation of miR-26b strongly suggests the key role it plays in the pathogenesis of HCV-related LPDs and its usefulness as a biomarker of the evolution of HCV infection to these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2013437078,"The microtubule-dependent molecular motor KIF23 (Kinesin family member 23) is one of two components of the centralspindlin complex assembled during late stages of mitosis. Formation of this complex is known as an essential step for cytokinesis. Here, we identified KIF23 as a new transcriptional target gene of the tumor suppressor protein p53. We showed that p53 reduces expression of KIF23 on the mRNA as well as the protein level in different cell types. Promoter reporter assays revealed that this repression results from downregulation of KIF23 promoter activity. CDK inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 was shown to be necessary to mediate p53-dependent repression. Furthermore, we identified the highly conserved cell cycle genes homology region (CHR) in the KIF23 promoter to be strictly required for p53-dependent repression as well as for cell cycle-dependent expression of KIF23. Cell cycle- and p53-dependent regulation of KIF23 appeared to be controlled by differential binding of DREAM and MMB complexes to the CHR element. With this study, we describe a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation of KIF23. Considering the strongly supporting function of KIF23 in cytokinesis, its p53-dependent repression may contribute to the prevention of uncontrolled cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2054451932,"Social experiences can organize physiological, neural, and reproductive function, but there are few experimental preparations that allow one to study the effect individuals have in structuring their social environment. We examined the connections between mechanisms underlying individual behavior and social dynamics in flocks of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater). We conducted targeted inactivations of the neural song control system in female subjects. Playback tests revealed that the lesions affected females' song preferences: lesioned females were no longer selective for high quality conspecific song. Instead, they reacted to all cowbird songs vigorously. When lesioned females were introduced into mixed-sex captive flocks, they were less likely to form strong pair-bonds, and they no longer showed preferences for dominant males. This in turn created a cascade of effects through the groups. Social network analyses showed that the introduction of the lesioned females created instabilities in the social structure: males in the groups changed their dominance status and their courtship patterns, and even the competitive behavior of other female group-mates was affected. These results reveal that inactivation of the song control system in female cowbirds not only affects individual behavior, but also exerts widespread effects on the stability of the entire social system."
https://openalex.org/W2029254212,"LAMTOR3 (MP1) and LAMTOR2 (p14) form a heterodimer as part of the larger Ragulator complex that is required for MAPK and mTOR1 signaling from late endosomes/lysosomes. Here, we show that loss of LAMTOR2 (p14) results in an unstable cytosolic monomeric pool of LAMTOR3 (MP1). Monomeric cytoplasmic LAMTOR3 is rapidly degraded in a proteasome-dependent but lysosome-independent manner. Mutational analyses indicated that the turnover of the protein is dependent on ubiquitination of several lysine residues. Similarly, other Ragulator subunits, LAMTOR1 (p18), LAMTOR4 (c7orf59), and LAMTOR5 (HBXIP), are degraded as well upon the loss of LAMTOR2. Thus the assembly of the Ragulator complex is monitored by cellular quality control systems, most likely to prevent aberrant signaling at the convergence of mTOR and MAPK caused by a defective Ragulator complex."
https://openalex.org/W2063550784,"The paired-box homeodomain transcription factor Pax3 is a key regulator of the nervous system, neural crest and skeletal muscle development. Despite the important role of this transcription factor, very few direct target genes have been characterized. We show that Itm2a, which encodes a type 2 transmembrane protein, is a direct Pax3 target in vivo, by combining genetic approaches and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We have generated a conditional mutant allele for Itm2a, which is an imprinted gene, by flanking exons 2–4 with loxP sites and inserting an IRESnLacZ reporter in the 3′ UTR of the gene. The LacZ reporter reproduces the expression profile of Itm2a, and allowed us to further characterize its expression at sites of myogenesis, in the dermomyotome and myotome of somites, and in limb buds, in the mouse embryo. We further show that Itm2a is not only expressed in adult muscle fibres but also in the satellite cells responsible for regeneration. Itm2a mutant mice are viable and fertile with no overt phenotype during skeletal muscle formation or regeneration. Potential compensatory mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2073537229,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, central to neural metabolism and function, is diminished in aging whereas enhanced after acute/sub-acute traumatic brain injury. To develop relevant translational models for these neuropathologies, we determined the impact of perturbed mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacities on intrinsic brain activity using clinically relevant markers. From a multi-compartment estimate of probable baseline Ca2+ ranges in the brain, we hypothesized that reduced or enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity would decrease or increase spontaneous neuronal activity respectively. As resting state fMRI-BOLD fluctuations and stimulus-evoked BOLD responses have similar physiological origins [1] and stimulus-evoked neuronal and hemodynamic responses are modulated by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity [2], [3] respectively, we tested our hypothesis by measuring hemodynamic fluctuations and spontaneous neuronal activities during normal and altered mitochondrial functional states. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacity was perturbed by pharmacologically inhibiting or enhancing the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (mCU) activity. Neuronal electrical activity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) fluctuations were measured simultaneously and integrated with fMRI-BOLD fluctuations at 11.7T. mCU inhibition reduced spontaneous neuronal activity and the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), whereas mCU enhancement increased spontaneous neuronal activity but reduced RSFC. We conclude that increased or decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake capacities lead to diminished resting state modes of brain functional connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1989031499,"The proprotein convertase furin requires the pH gradient of the secretory pathway to regulate its multistep, compartment-specific autocatalytic activation. Although His-69 within the furin prodomain serves as the pH sensor that detects transport of the propeptide-enzyme complex to the trans-Golgi network, where it promotes cleavage and release of the inhibitory propeptide, a mechanistic understanding of how His-69 protonation mediates furin activation remains unclear. Here we employ biophysical, biochemical, and computational approaches to elucidate the mechanism underlying the pH-dependent activation of furin. Structural analyses and binding experiments comparing the wild-type furin propeptide with a nonprotonatable His-69 → Leu mutant that blocks furin activation in vivo revealed protonation of His-69 reduces both the thermodynamic stability of the propeptide as well as its affinity for furin at pH 6.0. Structural modeling combined with mathematical modeling and molecular dynamic simulations suggested that His-69 does not directly contribute to the propeptide-enzyme interface but, rather, triggers movement of a loop region in the propeptide that modulates access to the cleavage site and, thus, allows for the tight pH regulation of furin activation. Our work establishes a mechanism by which His-69 functions as a pH sensor that regulates compartment-specific furin activation and provides insights into how other convertases and proteases may regulate their precise spatiotemporal activation."

Delta cortisol, the amount of rise in the 1 ug ACTH-test, was calculated. Primary endpoint was poor functional outcome defined as modified Rankin scale 3-6 after 1 year. Secondary endpoint was nonsurvival after 1 year.Logistic regression analysis showed that DHEAS (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.49), but not DHEA (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.04), was predictive for adverse functional outcome. Neither DHEA (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96-1.03) nor DHEAS (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.82-1.44) were associated with mortality. Baseline and stimulated cortisol were predictive for mortality (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.71; 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.60), but only basal cortisol for functional outcome (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.38).

https://openalex.org/W2068118555,"Carnivoran-dominated fossil sites provide precious insights into the diversity and ecology of species rarely recovered in the fossil record. The lower level assemblage of Batallones-1 fossil site (Late Miocene; Madrid Basin, Spain) has yielded one of the most abundant and diversified carnivoran assemblage ever known from the Cenozoic record of mammals. A comprehensive taphonomic study is carried out here in order to constrain the concentration mode of this remarkable assemblage. Another distinctive feature of Batallones-1 is that the accumulation of carnivoran remains took place in the context of a geomorphological landform (cavity formation through a piping process) practically unknown in the generation of fossil sites. Two characteristics of the assemblage highly restrict the probable causes for the accumulation of the remains: (1) the overwhelming number of carnivorans individuals; and (2) the mortality profiles estimated for the four most abundant taxa do not correspond to the classic mortality types but rather were the consequence of the behavior of the taxa. This evidence together with other taphonomic data supports the hypothesis that carnivoran individuals actively entered the cavity searching for resources (food or water) and were unable to exit. The scarcity of herbivores implies that the shaft was well visible and avoided by these taxa. Fossil bones exhibit a very good preservation state as a consequence of their deposition in the restricted and protective environment of the chamber. Batallones-1 had another assemblage (upper level assemblage) that was dominated by herbivore remains and that potentially corresponded to the final stages of the cavity filling."
https://openalex.org/W1989643947,"Transcription factors that can convert adult cells of one type to another are usually discovered empirically by testing factors with a known developmental role in the target cell. Here we show that standard genomic methods (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) can help identify these factors, as most are more strongly Polycomb repressed in the source cell and more highly expressed in the target cell. This criterion is an effective genome-wide screen that significantly enriches for factors that can transdifferentiate several mammalian cell types including neural stem cells, neurons, pancreatic islets, and hepatocytes. These results suggest that barriers between adult cell types, as depicted in Waddington's “epigenetic landscape”, consist in part of differentially Polycomb-repressed transcription factors. This genomic model of cell identity helps rationalize a growing number of transdifferentiation protocols and may help facilitate the engineering of cell identity for regenerative medicine."

https://openalex.org/W1996143253,"The neuronal transporter GlyT2 is a polytopic, 12-transmembrane domain, plasma membrane glycoprotein involved in the removal and recycling of synaptic glycine from inhibitory synapses. Mutations in the human GlyT2 gene (SLC6A5) that cause deficient glycine transport or defective GlyT2 trafficking are the second most common cause of hyperekplexia or startle disease. In this study we examined several aspects of GlyT2 biogenesis that involve the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin (CNX). CNX binds transiently to an intermediate under-glycosylated transporter precursor and facilitates GlyT2 processing. In cells expressing GlyT2, transporter accumulation and transport activity were attenuated by siRNA-mediated CNX knockdown and enhanced by CNX overexpression. GlyT2 binding to CNX was mediated by glycan and polypeptide-based interactions as revealed by pharmacological approaches and the behavior of GlyT2 N-glycan-deficient mutants. Moreover, transporter folding appeared to be stabilized by N-glycans. Co-expression of CNX and a fully non-glycosylated mutant rescues glycine transport but not mutant surface expression. Hence, CNX discriminates between different conformational states of GlyT2 displaying a lectin-independent chaperone activity. GlyT2 wild-type and mutant transporters were finally degraded in the lysosome. Our findings provide further insight into GlyT2 biogenesis, and a useful framework for the study of newly synthesized GlyT2 transporters bearing hyperekplexia mutations."

https://openalex.org/W1973783962,"Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown a number of advantages that make this multimodal technique superior to fMRI alone. The feasibility of recording EEG at ultra-high static magnetic field up to 9.4T was recently demonstrated and promises to be implemented soon in fMRI studies at ultra high magnetic fields. Recording visual evoked potentials are expected to be amongst the most simple for simultaneous EEG/fMRI at ultra-high magnetic field due to the easy assessment of the visual cortex. Auditory evoked P300 measurements are of interest since it is believed that they represent the earliest stage of cognitive processing. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of recording visual evoked potentials and auditory evoked P300 in a 9.4T static magnetic field. For this purpose, EEG data were recorded from 26 healthy volunteers inside a 9.4T MR scanner using a 32-channel MR compatible EEG system. Visual stimulation and auditory oddball paradigm were presented in order to elicit evoked related potentials (ERP). Recordings made outside the scanner were performed using the same stimuli and EEG system for comparison purposes. We were able to retrieve visual P100 and auditory P300 evoked potentials at 9.4T static magnetic field after correction of the ballistocardiogram artefact using independent component analysis. The latencies of the ERPs recorded at 9.4T were not different from those recorded at 0T. The amplitudes of ERPs were higher at 9.4T when compared to recordings at 0T. Nevertheless, it seems that the increased amplitudes of the ERPs are due to the effect of the ultra-high field on the EEG recording system rather than alteration in the intrinsic processes that generate the electrophysiological responses."

Methodology MRI was used to evaluate the effects of overexpressing VEGF-A (VEGF165) on tumor angiogenesis and ECM remodeling in vivo, for two differentially metastatic human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Principal Findings Overexpression of VEGF elevated vascular volume in both MCF-7-VEGF and MDA-MB-231-VEGF tumors relative to their wild-type counterparts, but vascular permeability was elevated only in MCF-7-VEGF tumors. A significant increase in the volume of extravascular fluid drained as well as the number of ECM drainage voxels was detected in MCF-7-VEGF tumors relative to MCF-7 tumors, but not in MDA-MB-231-VEGF versus MDA-MB-231 tumors. The angiogenic effects of VEGF overexpression in both MCF-7-VEGF and MDA-MB-231-VEGF tumors were validated histologically. MCF-7-VEGF tumors exhibited enhanced invasion and a greater fraction of cancer positive lungs and lymph nodes relative to MCF-7 tumors. Conclusions and Significance In vivo MRI and histological data demonstrate that VEGF overexpression results in the progression of noninvasive MCF-7 and invasive MDA-MB-321 tumors to a more angiogenic phenotype. However, VEGF overexpression significantly altered ECM integrity only in MCF-7 tumors, causing them to progress to an invasive and metastatic phenotype. This study for the first time demonstrates the concurrent effects of VEGF overexpression and ECM remodeling on metastasis in vivo. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vivo MRI can non-invasively monitor changes in the tumor microenvironment that can potentially predict a cancer’s ability to metastasize."
https://openalex.org/W2064302529,"Ecologists have historically used species-area relationships (SARs) as a tool to understand the spatial distribution of species. Recent work has extended SARs to focus on individual-level distributions to generate individual species area relationships (ISARs). The ISAR approach quantifies whether individuals of a species tend have more or less species richness surrounding them than expected by chance. By identifying richness 'accumulators' and 'repellers', respectively, the ISAR approach has been used to infer the relative importance of abiotic and biotic interactions and neutrality. A clear limitation of the SAR and ISAR approaches is that all species are treated as evolutionarily independent and that a large amount of work has now shown that local tree neighborhoods exhibit non-random phylogenetic structure given the species richness. Here, we use nine tropical and temperate forest dynamics plots to ask: (i) do ISARs change predictably across latitude?; (ii) is the phylogenetic diversity in the neighborhood of species accumulators and repellers higher or lower than that expected given the observed species richness?; and (iii) do species accumulators, repellers distributed non-randomly on the community phylogenetic tree? The results indicate no clear trend in ISARs from the temperate zone to the tropics and that the phylogenetic diversity surrounding the individuals of species is generally only non-random on very local scales. Interestingly the distribution of species accumulators and repellers was non-random on the community phylogenies suggesting the presence of phylogenetic signal in the ISAR across latitude."
https://openalex.org/W2049633454,"Repair in multiple sclerosis involves remyelination, a process in which axons are provided with a new myelin sheath by new oligodendrocytes. Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are a family of growth factors that have been shown to influence the response of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vivo during demyelination and remyelination in the adult brain. We have previously shown that BMP4 infusion increases numbers of OPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination, while infusion of Noggin, an endogenous antagonist of BMP4 increases numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and remyelinated axons following recovery. Additional studies have shown that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes the survival of OPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination. Based on these data, we investigated whether myelin repair could be further enhanced by sequential infusion of these agents firstly, BMP4 to increase OPC numbers, followed by either Noggin or IGF-1 to increase the differentiation and survival of the newly generated OPCs. We identified that sequential delivery of BMP4 and IGF-1 during cuprizone challenge increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and decreased astrocyte numbers following recovery compared with vehicle infused mice, but did not alter remyelination. However, sequential delivery of BMP4 and Noggin during cuprizone challenge did not alter numbers of oligodendrocytes or astrocytes in the corpus callosum compared with vehicle infused mice. Furthermore, electron microscopy analysis revealed no change in average myelin thickness in the corpus callosum between vehicle infused and BMP4-Noggin infused mice. Our results suggest that while single delivery of Noggin or IGF-1 increased the production of mature oligodendrocytes in vivo in the context of demyelination, only Noggin infusion promoted remyelination. Thus, sequential delivery of BMP4 and Noggin or IGF-1 does not further enhance myelin repair above what occurs with delivery of Noggin alone."
https://openalex.org/W2011337933,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) are important regulators of signal transduction processes. Essential for the functional characterization of PTPs is the identification of their physiological substrates, and an important step towards this goal is the demonstration of a physical interaction. The association of PTPs with their cellular substrates is, however, often transient and difficult to detect with unmodified proteins at endogenous levels. Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1/PTPRJ) is a regulator of hematopoietic cell functions, and a candidate tumor suppressor. However, association of DEP-1 with any of its proposed substrates at endogenous levels has not yet been shown. We have previously obtained functional and biochemical evidence for a direct interaction of DEP-1 with the hematopoietic receptor-tyrosine kinase Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). In the current study we have used the method of in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA) to validate this interaction at endogenous levels, and to further characterize it. In situ PLA readily detected association of endogenous DEP-1 and FLT3 in the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1, which was enhanced by FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation in a time-dependent manner. Association peaked between 10 and 20 min of stimulation and returned to basal levels at 30 min. This time course was similar to the time course of FLT3 autophosphorylation. FLT3 kinase inhibition and DEP-1 oxidation abrogated association. Consistent with a functional role of DEP-1-FLT3 interaction, stable knockdown of DEP-1 in THP-1 cells enhanced FL-induced ERK1/2 activation. These findings support that FLT3 is a bona fide substrate of DEP-1 and that interaction occurs mainly via an enzyme-substrate complex formation triggered by FLT3 ligand stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2047354326,"Colorectal cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The disease is curable when detected at an early stage. However, the compliance rate with current screening recommendations remains poor. An accurate, minimally invasive blood test that has the potential for greater patient compliance would be a welcome addition to the current methods. Recent data have shown that gene expression profile of peripheral blood cells can reflect disease states and thus have diagnostic value. In this study, genome-wide gene expression profiling of peripheral blood cells from 20 healthy controls and 20 colorectal cancer patients were performed using PAXgene™ technology and Affymetrix GeneChip® microarrays. We identified a list of 1,469 genes that were differentially expressed between the healthy controls and cancer patients. Gene annotation and functional enrichment analysis revealed that those genes are mainly related to immune functions. Particularly, a set of genes belonging to the Toll-Like Receptor pathways were up-regulated in the colorectal cancer patients. These findings provide a new understanding of blood gene expression profile in colorectal cancer. Our result may serve as the basis for further development of blood biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2076744371,"In unsupervised contention-based networks such as EDCA mode of IEEE 802.11(e)(s), upon winning the channel, each node gets a transmission opportunity (TXOP) in which the node can transmit multiple frames consequently without releasing the channel. Adjusting TXOP can lead to better bandwidth utilization and QoS provisioning. To improve WLAN throughput performance, EDCA packet bursting can be used in 802.11e, meaning that once a station has gained an EDCA-TXOP, it can be allowed to transmit more than one frame without re-contending for the channel. Following the access to the channel, the station can send multiple frames as long as the total access time does not exceed the TXOP Limit. This mechanism can reduce the network overhead and increase the channel utilization instead. However, packet bursting may cause unfairness in addition to increasing jitter, delay and loss. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, although TXOP tuning has been investigated through different methods, it has not been considered within a game theory framework. In this study, based on the analytical models of EDCA, a game theoretic approach called GTXOP is proposed to determine TXOP dynamically (i.e. according to the dynamisms of WLAN networks and the number of nodes in the network). Using GTXOP, each node can choose its TXOP autonomously, such that in addition to QoS improvement, the overall network performance is also improved."

Methods A pair of post-mortem donor corneas, from a 55-year old patient who underwent uncomplicated LASIK surgery five years previously, were bisected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The right cornea and one half of the left cornea were processed for light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. One half of the right cornea was also examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results The flap-bed interface could be easily detected several years after LASIK and, although the flap appeared to be in close association with the stromal bed, there was a noticeable absence of reconnection between adjacent severed lamellae. Tissue gaps were evident at the flap margin, which once free of cellular components revealed the presence of a few bridging fibres. Conclusion Examination of corneas five years after LASIK revealed evidence of primitive reparative scar development at the wound interface, but no reconnection of severed collagen lamellae. Such findings may explain the occurrence of flap dislocation following trauma in some patients months or years after surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2166857011,"RLIM acts as a negative regulator of LIM-Homeodomain proteins either by recruiting Sin3A/Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) co-repressor complex or through degradation of CLIM coactivator, thus playing an important role in embryonic development. Recent studies by different research groups have shown that RLIM acts as an X-encoded, dose-dependent inducer of X chromosome inactivation in mouse embryonic stem cells. However, until now, very little is known about the expression regulation of RLIM gene, and we tried to study the transcriptional regulation of RLIM gene. In the present study, we identified RLIM as a novel target of p53 and demonstrated that p53 repressed both mRNA and protein levels of RLIM. Expression of wild type p53, but not p53 mutants, led to repression of the RLIM promoter activity. We further identified four putative Sp1 elements (S1 to S4) on the RLIM promoter that are essential for p53-mediated repression of RLIM. Although p53 does not directly bind to the RLIM promoter, it physically interacts with and prevents the binding of Sp1 to the RLIM promoter. Thus, RLIM is a novel target of p53, and p53 exerts its inhibitory effect on RLIM expression by interfering with Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation on RLIM. Our results provided data to enlarge the knowledge of transcriptional regulation of RLIM and suggested a new pathway by which physiological and pathological activators of p53 may affect development."

However, the lack of standardization in genomic diagnostics translates into a major risk of error introduction. To ensure the integrity of such data—and their application—we suggest the development of 'good genomic practice' standards to guide the field."
https://openalex.org/W2159314003,"Species with widespread distributions that grow in varied habitats may consist of ecotypes adapted to a particular habitat, or may exhibit cross-tolerance that enables them to exploit a variety of habitats. Populations of Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata (L.) O'Kane & Al-Shehbaz grow in a wide variety of edaphic settings including serpentine soil, limestone sand, and alluvial flood plains. While all three of these environments share some stressors, a crucial difference among these environments is soil calcium to magnesium ratio, which ranges from 25:1 in the limestone sand to 0.2:1 in serpentine soil. The three populations found on these substrates were subjected to three different Ca to Mg ratios under controlled environmental conditions during germination and rosette growth. Response to Ca to Mg ratio was evaluated through germination success and radicle growth rate, rosette growth rate, and the content of Ca and Mg in the rosette. All three populations were particularly efficient in fueling growth under nutrient deficiency, with the highest nutrient efficiency ratio for Ca under Ca deficiency and for Mg under Mg deficiency. Although the serpentine population had significantly higher leaf Ca to Mg ratio than the limestone or flood plain populations under all three Ca to Mg ratios, this increase did not result in any advantage in growth or appearance of the serpentine plants, during early life stages before the onset of flowering, even in the high Mg substrate. The three populations showed no population by substrate interaction for any of the parameters measured indicating that these populations may have cross-tolerance to substrate Ca to Mg ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2092537160,"The mechanistic study of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases requires the generation of mouse models that reproduce the alterations in immune responses observed in patients. Methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA) has been widely used to induce antigen-specific inflammation in targeted organs or in combination with single stranded DNA (ssDNA) to generate anti-nucleic acids antibodies in vivo. However, the mechanism by which this modified protein triggers inflammation is poorly understood. By analyzing the biochemical properties of mBSA, we found that mBSA exhibits features of an intermediate of protein misfolding pathway. mBSA readily interact with a list of dyes that have binding specificity towards amyloid fibrils. Intriguingly, mBSA displayed cytotoxic activity and its binding to ssDNA further enhanced formation of beta-sheet rich amyloid fibrils. Moreover, mBSA is recognized by the serum amyloid P, a protein unanimously associated with amyloid plaques in vivo. In macrophages, we observed that mBSA disrupted the lysosomal compartment, signaled along the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, and activated caspase 1, which led to the production of IL-1β. In vivo, mBSA triggered rapid and prominent immune cell infiltration that is dependent on IL-1β induction. Taken together, these data demonstrate that by mimicking amyloidogenic proteins mBSA exhibits strong innate immune functions and serves as a potent adjuvant. These findings advance our understanding on the underlying mechanism of how aberrant immune responses lead to autoimmune reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2061142153,"Mammaglobin A (MGBA) is a novel breast cancer-associated antigen almost exclusively over-expressed in primary and metastatic human breast cancers, making it a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. The development of dendritic cell (DC)-induced tumor antigen specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) may hold promise in cancer immunotherapy. In this study we constructed recombinant replication-defective adenoviral (Ad) vectors encoding MGBA and evaluated their ability to trigger anti-tumor immunity in vitro. DCs were isolated from the human peripheral blood monocyte cells (PBMCs) of two HLA-A33+ healthy female volunteers, and infected with adenovirus carrying MGBA cDNA (Ad-MGBA). After that, the Ad-MGBA-infected DCs were used to stimulate CD8+ CTLs in vitro and the latter was used for co-culture with breast cancer cell lines. The data revealed that infection with Ad-MGBA improved DC maturation and up-regulated the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12), but down-regulated interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion from DCs. Ad-MGBA-infected DC-stimulated CD8+CTLs displayed the highest cytotoxicity towards HLA-A33+/MGBA+ breast cancer MDA-MB-415 cells compared with other CD8+CTL populations, and compared with the cytotoxicity towards HLA-A33−/MGBA+ breast cancer HBL-100 cells and HLA-A33−/MGBA− breast cancer MDA-MB 231 cells. In addition, Ad-MGBA-infected DC-stimulated CD8+ CTLs showed a high level of IFNγ secretion when stimulated with HLA-A33+/MGBA+ breast cancer MDA-MB-415 cells, but not when stimulated with HLA-A33−/MGBA+ HBL-100 and HLA-A33−/MGBA−MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, killing of CD8+CTLs against breast cancer was in a major histocompability complex (MHC)-limited pattern. Finally, the data also determined the importance of TNF-α in activating DCs and T cells. These data together suggest that MGBA recombinant adenovirus-infected DCs could induce specific anti-tumor immunity against MGBA+ breast cancers, which could provide a novel strategy in the immunotherapy of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054679998,"The nuclear receptor NR2E3 promotes expression of rod photoreceptor genes while repressing cone genes. Mice lacking NR2E3 (Nr2e3(rd7/rd7) referred to here as rd7) are a model for enhanced S-cone syndrome, a disease associated with increased sensitivity to blue light and night blindness. Rd7 retinas have reduced levels of the outer segment (OS) structural protein retinal degeneration slow (RDS). We test the hypothesis that increasing RDS levels would improve the Rd7 phenotype. Transgenic mice over-expressing normal mouse peripherin/RDS (NMP) in rods and cones were crossed onto the rd7 background. Disease phenotypes were assessed in NMP/rd7 eyes and compared to wild-type (WT) and rd7 eyes at postnatal day 30. NMP/rd7 retinas expressed total RDS (transgenic and endogenous) message at WT levels, and NMP protein was correctly localized to the OS. NMP/rd7 retinas have shorter OSs compared to rd7 and WT and significantly reduced number of rosettes. NMP/rd7 mice also exhibited significant deficits in scotopic ERG amplitudes compared to rd7 while photopic amplitudes remained unaffected. Protein levels of rhodopsin, RDS, and the RDS homologue ROM-1 were significantly reduced in the NMP/rd7 retinas compared to rd7. We show that correcting the levels of RDS gene expression does not improve the phenotype of the rd7 suggesting that RDS deficiency is not responsible for the defect in this model. We suggest that the specific rod defect in the NMP/rd7 is likely associated with ongoing problems in the rd7 that are related to the expression of cone genes in rod cells, a characteristic of the model."
