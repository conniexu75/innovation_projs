https://openalex.org/W2888416545,"Cannabis use is a heritable trait that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. In the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for lifetime cannabis use to date (N = 184,765), we identified eight genome-wide significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms in six regions. All measured genetic variants combined explained 11% of the variance. Gene-based tests revealed 35 significant genes in 16 regions, and S-PrediXcan analyses showed that 21 genes had different expression levels for cannabis users versus nonusers. The strongest finding across the different analyses was CADM2, which has been associated with substance use and risk-taking. Significant genetic correlations were found with 14 of 25 tested substance use and mental health-related traits, including smoking, alcohol use, schizophrenia and risk-taking. Mendelian randomization analysis showed evidence for a causal positive influence of schizophrenia risk on cannabis use. Overall, our study provides new insights into the etiology of cannabis use and its relation with mental health."

Here we uniformly analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 249 tumors and matched normal tissue from patients with clinically annotated outcomes to immune checkpoint therapy, including radiographic response, across multiple cancer types to examine additional tumor genomic features that contribute to selective response. Our analyses identified genomic correlates of response beyond mutational burden, including somatic events in individual driver genes, certain global mutational signatures, and specific HLA-restricted neoantigens. However, these features were often interrelated, highlighting the complexity of identifying genetic driver events that generate an immunoresponsive tumor environment. This study lays a path forward in analyzing large clinical cohorts in an integrated and multifaceted manner to enhance the ability to discover clinically meaningful predictive features of response to immune checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2886557383,"Trillions of microorganisms inhabit the human gut and are regarded as potential key factors for health1,2. Characteristics such as diet, lifestyle, or genetics can shape the composition of the gut microbiota2-6 and are usually shared by individuals from comparable ethnic origin. So far, most studies assessing how ethnicity relates to the intestinal microbiota compared small groups living at separate geographical locations7-10. Using fecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in 2,084 participants of the Healthy Life in an Urban Setting (HELIUS) study11,12, we show that individuals living in the same city tend to share similar gut microbiota characteristics with others of their ethnic background. Ethnicity contributed to explain the interindividual dissimilarities in gut microbiota composition, with three main poles primarily characterized by operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Prevotella (Moroccans, Turks, Ghanaians), Bacteroides (African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese), and Clostridiales (Dutch). The Dutch exhibited the greatest gut microbiota α-diversity and the South-Asian Surinamese the smallest, with corresponding enrichment or depletion in numerous OTUs. Ethnic differences in α-diversity and interindividual dissimilarities were independent of metabolic health and only partly explained by ethnic-related characteristics including sociodemographic, lifestyle, or diet factors. Hence, the ethnic origin of individuals may be an important factor to consider in microbiome research and its potential future applications in ethnic-diverse societies."
https://openalex.org/W2888500336,"The human genome contains thousands of long non-coding RNAs1, but specific biological functions and biochemical mechanisms have been discovered for only about a dozen2-7. A specific long non-coding RNA-non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD)-has recently been shown to be required for maintaining genomic stability8, but its molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we combine RNA antisense purification and quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteins that directly interact with NORAD in living cells. We show that NORAD interacts with proteins involved in DNA replication and repair in steady-state cells and localizes to the nucleus upon stimulation with replication stress or DNA damage. In particular, NORAD interacts with RBMX, a component of the DNA-damage response, and contains the strongest RBMX-binding site in the transcriptome. We demonstrate that NORAD controls the ability of RBMX to assemble a ribonucleoprotein complex-which we term NORAD-activated ribonucleoprotein complex 1 (NARC1)-that contains the known suppressors of genomic instability topoisomerase I (TOP1), ALYREF and the PRPF19-CDC5L complex. Cells depleted for NORAD or RBMX display an increased frequency of chromosome segregation defects, reduced replication-fork velocity and altered cell-cycle progression-which represent phenotypes that are mechanistically linked to TOP1 and PRPF19-CDC5L function. Expression of NORAD in trans can rescue defects caused by NORAD depletion, but rescue is significantly impaired when the RBMX-binding site in NORAD is deleted. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between NORAD and RBMX is important for NORAD function, and that NORAD is required for the assembly of the previously unknown topoisomerase complex NARC1, which contributes to maintaining genomic stability. In addition, we uncover a previously unknown function for long non-coding RNAs in modulating the ability of an RNA-binding protein to assemble a higher-order ribonucleoprotein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2888160268,"Innate immune cells recruited to inflammatory sites have short life spans and originate from the marrow, which is distributed throughout the long and flat bones. While bone marrow production and release of leukocyte increases after stroke, it is currently unknown whether its activity rises homogeneously throughout the entire hematopoietic system. To address this question, we employed spectrally resolved in vivo cell labeling in the murine skull and tibia. We show that in murine models of stroke and aseptic meningitis, skull bone marrow-derived neutrophils are more likely to migrate to the adjacent brain tissue than cells that reside in the tibia. Confocal microscopy of the skull-dura interface revealed myeloid cell migration through microscopic vascular channels crossing the inner skull cortex. These observations point to a direct local interaction between the brain and the skull bone marrow through the meninges."
https://openalex.org/W2767443671,"We describe convergent evidence from transcriptomics, morphology, and physiology for a specialized GABAergic neuron subtype in human cortex. Using unbiased single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we identify ten GABAergic interneuron subtypes with combinatorial gene signatures in human cortical layer 1 and characterize a group of human interneurons with anatomical features never described in rodents, having large 'rosehip'-like axonal boutons and compact arborization. These rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (GAD1+CCK+, CNR1-SST-CALB2-PVALB-) matching a single transcriptomically defined cell type whose specific molecular marker signature is not seen in mouse cortex. Rosehip cells in layer 1 make homotypic gap junctions, predominantly target apical dendritic shafts of layer 3 pyramidal neurons, and inhibit backpropagating pyramidal action potentials in microdomains of the dendritic tuft. These cells are therefore positioned for potent local control of distal dendritic computation in cortical pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2888330909,"Metformin is a first-line drug for the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes, yet its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Metformin exerts its antihyperglycemic action primarily through lowering hepatic glucose production (HGP). This suppression is thought to be mediated through inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, and thus elevation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels and the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), though this proposition has been challenged given results in mice lacking hepatic AMPK. Here we report that the AMP-inhibited enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-1 (FBP1), a rate-controlling enzyme in gluconeogenesis, functions as a major contributor to the therapeutic action of metformin. We identified a point mutation in FBP1 that renders it insensitive to AMP while sparing regulation by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), and knock-in (KI) of this mutant in mice significantly reduces their response to metformin treatment. We observe this during a metformin tolerance test and in a metformin-euglycemic clamp that we have developed. The antihyperglycemic effect of metformin in high-fat diet-fed diabetic FBP1-KI mice was also significantly blunted compared to wild-type controls. Collectively, we show a new mechanism of action for metformin and provide further evidence that molecular targeting of FBP1 can have antihyperglycemic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2949476985,"Glioblastoma is characterized by widespread genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity, yet little is known about the role of the epigenome in glioblastoma disease progression. Here, we present genome-scale maps of DNA methylation in matched primary and recurring glioblastoma tumors, using data from a highly annotated clinical cohort that was selected through a national patient registry. We demonstrate the feasibility of DNA methylation mapping in a large set of routinely collected FFPE samples, and we validate bisulfite sequencing as a multipurpose assay that allowed us to infer a range of different genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional characteristics of the profiled tumor samples. On the basis of these data, we identified subtle differences between primary and recurring tumors, links between DNA methylation and the tumor microenvironment, and an association of epigenetic tumor heterogeneity with patient survival. In summary, this study establishes an open resource for dissecting DNA methylation heterogeneity in a genetically diverse and heterogeneous cancer, and it demonstrates the feasibility of integrating epigenomics, radiology, and digital pathology for a national cohort, thereby leveraging existing samples and data collected as part of routine clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2888423279,"DNA mutations are known cancer drivers. Here we investigated whether mRNA events that are upregulated in cancer can functionally mimic the outcome of genetic alterations. RNA sequencing or 3′-end sequencing techniques were applied to normal and malignant B cells from 59 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)1–3. We discovered widespread upregulation of truncated mRNAs and proteins in primary CLL cells that were not generated by genetic alterations but instead occurred by intronic polyadenylation. Truncated mRNAs caused by intronic polyadenylation were recurrent (n = 330) and predominantly affected genes with tumour-suppressive functions. The truncated proteins generated by intronic polyadenylation often lack the tumour-suppressive functions of the corresponding full-length proteins (such as DICER and FOXN3), and several even acted in an oncogenic manner (such as CARD11, MGA and CHST11). In CLL, the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by aberrant mRNA processing is substantially more prevalent than the functional loss of such genes through genetic events. We further identified new candidate tumour-suppressor genes that are inactivated by intronic polyadenylation in leukaemia and by truncating DNA mutations in solid tumours4,5. These genes are understudied in cancer, as their overall mutation rates are lower than those of well-known tumour-suppressor genes. Our findings show the need to go beyond genomic analyses in cancer diagnostics, as mRNA events that are silent at the DNA level are widespread contributors to cancer pathogenesis through the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes. The inactivation of tumour suppressor genes at the level of mRNA occurs by the generation of truncated proteins in leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2888208011,"The putative Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) is essential for transport of malarial effector proteins across a parasite-encasing vacuolar membrane into host erythrocytes, but the mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here we show that PTEX is a bona fide translocon by determining structures of the PTEX core complex at near-atomic resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. We isolated the endogenous PTEX core complex containing EXP2, PTEX150 and HSP101 from Plasmodium falciparum in the 'engaged' and 'resetting' states of endogenous cargo translocation using epitope tags inserted using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. In the structures, EXP2 and PTEX150 interdigitate to form a static, funnel-shaped pseudo-seven-fold-symmetric protein-conducting channel spanning the vacuolar membrane. The spiral-shaped AAA+ HSP101 hexamer is tethered above this funnel, and undergoes pronounced compaction that allows three of six tyrosine-bearing pore loops lining the HSP101 channel to dissociate from the cargo, resetting the translocon for the next threading cycle. Our work reveals the mechanism of P. falciparum effector export, and will inform structure-based design of drugs targeting this unique translocon."
https://openalex.org/W2889377815,"Bioenergy crops are an attractive option for use in energy production. A good plant candidate for bioenergy applications should produce a high amount of biomass and resist harsh environmental conditions. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CBNs) have been described as promising seed germination and plant growth regulators. In this paper, we tested the impact of two CBNs: graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on germination and biomass production of two major bioenergy crops (sorghum and switchgrass). The application of graphene and CNTs increased the germination rate of switchgrass seeds and led to an early germination of sorghum seeds. The exposure of switchgrass to graphene (200 mg/l) resulted in a 28% increase of total biomass produced compared to untreated plants. We tested the impact of CBNs on bioenergy crops under salt stress conditions and discovered that CBNs can significantly reduce symptoms of salt stress imposed by the addition of NaCl into the growth medium. Using an ion selective electrode, we demonstrated that the concentration of Na+ ions in NaCl solution can be significantly decreased by the addition of CNTs to the salt solution. Our data confirmed the potential of CBNs as plant growth regulators for non-food crops and demonstrated the role of CBNs in the protection of plants against salt stress by desalination of saline growth medium."
https://openalex.org/W2889380083,"Bone marrow stromal (a.k.a. mesenchymal stem) cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into osteoblasts (OBs), adipocytes, or chondrocytes. As BMSCs undergo OB differentiation, they up-regulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Here, we investigated the mechanism(s) connecting mitochondrial OxPhos to OB differentiation. First, we found that treating BMSC-like C3H10T1/2 cells with an OxPhos inhibitor reduces their osteogenic potential. Interestingly, ATP levels were not reduced, as glycolysis compensated for the decreased OxPhos. Thus, mitochondria support OB differentiation not only by supplying ATP, but also by other mechanisms. To uncover these mechanisms, we stimulated OxPhos in C3H10T1/2 cells by replacing media glucose with galactose and observed that this substitution increases both OxPhos and osteogenesis even in the absence of osteoinducers. β-Catenin, an important signaling pathway in osteogenesis, was found to be responsive to OxPhos stimulation. β-Catenin activity is maintained by acetylation, and mitochondria generate the acetyl donor acetyl-CoA, which upon entering the Krebs cycle is converted to citrate capable of exiting mitochondria. Cytosolic citrate is converted back to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). We found that inhibiting ACLY with SB204990 (SB) reverses the galactose-induced β-catenin activity and OB differentiation. This suggested that acetylation is involved in β-catenin activation after forced OxPhos stimulation, and using immunoprecipitation, we indeed detected SB-sensitive β-catenin acetylation. Both β-catenin acetylation and activity increased during osteoinduction coincident with OxPhos activation. These findings suggest that active mitochondria support OB differentiation by promoting β-catenin acetylation and thus activity.

https://openalex.org/W2952856780,"Predicting preterm birth is uncertain, and numerous scientists are searching for non-invasive methods to improve its predictability. Current researches are based on the analysis of ElectroHysteroGram (EHG) records, which contain information about the electrophysiological properties of the uterine muscle and uterine contractions. Since pregnancy is a long process, we decided to also characterize, for the first time, non-contraction intervals (dummy intervals) of the uterine records, i.e., EHG signals accompanied by a simultaneously recorded external tocogram measuring mechanical uterine activity (TOCO signal). For this purpose, we developed a new set of uterine records, TPEHGT DS, containing preterm and term uterine records of pregnant women, and uterine records of non-pregnant women. We quantitatively characterized contraction intervals (contractions) and dummy intervals of the uterine records of the TPEHGT DS in terms of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals, and developed a new method for predicting preterm birth. The results on the characterization revealed that the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals of the contraction and dummy intervals in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz, describing the electrical and mechanical activity of the uterus due to the maternal heart (maternal heart rate), are high only during term pregnancies, when the delivery is still far away; and they are low when the delivery is close. However, these peak amplitudes are also low during preterm pregnancies, when the delivery is still supposed to be far away (thus suggesting the danger of preterm birth); and they are also low or barely present for non-pregnant women. We propose the values of the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra due to the influence of the maternal heart, in an electro-mechanical sense, in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz as a new biophysical marker for the preliminary, or early, assessment of the danger of preterm birth. The classification of preterm and term, contraction and dummy intervals of the TPEHGT DS, for the task of the automatic prediction of preterm birth, using sample entropy, the median frequency of the power spectra, and the peak amplitude of the normalized power spectra, revealed that the dummy intervals provide quite comparable and slightly higher classification performances than these features obtained from the contraction intervals. This result suggests a novel and simple clinical technique, not necessarily to seek contraction intervals but using the dummy intervals, for the early assessment of the danger of preterm birth. Using the publicly available TPEHG DB database to predict preterm birth in terms of classifying between preterm and term EHG records, the proposed method outperformed all currently existing methods. The achieved classification accuracy was 100% for early records, recorded around the 23rd week of pregnancy; and 96.33%, the area under the curve of 99.44%, for all records of the database. Since the proposed method is capable of using the dummy intervals with high classification accuracy, it is also suitable for clinical use very early during pregnancy, around the 23rd week of pregnancy, when contractions may or may not be present."

https://openalex.org/W2889247700,"This study explores the relationship between the perceived physical literacy (PL) and physical activity (PA) levels of Hong Kong adolescents by using a cross-sectional study design. A total of 1,945 adolescents aged between 12 and 18, (1,028 male and 917 female) with a mean age of 14.98 (±1.65 years), took part in this study. A Perceived Physical Literacy Instrument (PPLI) and an International Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (IPAQ-A) were distributed to the participants within the first 15 minutes of PE lessons at their schools. The correlation between perceived PL and PA levels was low but significant (r = 0.227, p < 0.01), as was the correlation between the attributes of PL and PA intensity and the domains of PA (r = 0.067-0.292, p < 0.01). A significant linear equation was computed (F (3, 1941) = 35.679, p < 0.01), with an R2 of 0.052. The metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes representing participants' predicted PA levels were -5490 + 366.1 (sense of self and self-confidence) + 221.866 (self-expression and communication with others) + 287.748 (knowledge and understanding). Looking at individual factors, the correlation between perceived PL and PA levels showed no significant difference across gender (r male = 0.234; r female = 0.198) but showed a significant difference across grade level (r junior = 0.302; r senior = 0.197), school bands (r band 1 = 0.31; r band 2 = 0.263; r band 3 = 0.191) and socio-economic status (SES) (rlow = 0.225; rmedium = 0.35; rhigh = 0.191). The relationship between perceived PL and PA levels was significantly low but was closely related to the recreational PA, including individual factors such as gender, grade levels, school band and SES. Future studies could focus on school-based PA intervention programmes for perceived PL and the relationship between perceived PL and objective PA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2889501145,"Despite its recommendation by the current guidelines, the role of long-term oral beta-blocker therapy has never been evaluated by randomized trials in uncomplicated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction or ventricular arrhythmia who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).In a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, STEMI patients with successful primary PCI within 24 hours from the onset and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥40% were randomly assigned in a 1-to-1 fashion either to the carvedilol group or to the no beta-blocker group within 7 days after primary PCI. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome. Between August 2010 and May 2014, 801 patients were randomly assigned to the carvedilol group (N = 399) or the no beta-blocker group (N = 402) at 67 centers in Japan. The carvedilol dose was up-titrated from 3.4±2.1 mg at baseline to 6.3±4.3 mg at 1-year. During median follow-up of 3.9 years with 96.4% follow-up, the cumulative 3-year incidences of both the primary endpoint and any coronary revascularization were not significantly different between the carvedilol and no beta-blocker groups (6.8% and 7.9%, P = 0.20, and 20.3% and 17.7%, P = 0.65, respectively). There also was no significant difference in LVEF at 1-year between the 2 groups (60.9±8.4% and 59.6±8.8%, P = 0.06).Long-term carvedilol therapy added on the contemporary evidence-based medications did not seem beneficial in selected STEMI patients treated with primary PCI.CAPITAL-RCT (Carvedilol Post-Intervention Long-Term Administration in Large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial) ClinicalTrials.gov.number, NCT 01155635."
https://openalex.org/W2888056996,"Differences between female and male brains exist across the animal kingdom and extend from molecular to anatomical features. Here we show that sexually dimorphic anatomy, gene expression and function in the nervous system can be modulated by past experiences. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sexual differentiation entails the sex-specific pruning of synaptic connections between neurons that are shared by both sexes, giving rise to sexually dimorphic circuits in adult animals1. We discovered that starvation during juvenile stages is memorized in males to suppress the emergence of sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity. These circuit changes result in increased chemosensory responsiveness in adult males following juvenile starvation. We find that an octopamine-mediated starvation signal dampens the production of serotonin (5-HT) to convey the memory of starvation. Serotonin production is monitored by a 5-HT1A serotonin receptor homologue that acts cell-autonomously to promote the pruning of sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity under well-fed conditions. Our studies demonstrate how life history shapes neurotransmitter production, synaptic connectivity and behavioural output in a sexually dimorphic circuit. In Caenorhabditis elegans, starvation early in life suppresses later sex-specific pruning of synapses through lasting changes in monoaminergic signalling."

Here, we employ the large-scale subway smartcard data of Shenzhen, a major city of China, to predict dynamical passenger flows in the subway network. Four classical predictive models: historical average model, multilayer perceptron neural network model, support vector regression model, and gradient boosted regression trees model, were analyzed. Ordinary and anomalous traffic conditions were identified for each subway station by using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The prediction accuracy of each predictive model was analyzed under ordinary and anomalous traffic conditions to explore the high-performance condition (ordinary traffic condition or anomalous traffic condition) of different predictive models. In addition, we studied how long in advance that passenger flows can be accurately predicted by each predictive model. Our finding highlights the importance of selecting proper models to improve the accuracy of passenger flow prediction, and that inherent patterns of passenger flows are more prominently influencing the accuracy of prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2889266241,"Researchers interested in the effect of health on various life outcomes (such as employment, earnings and life satisfaction) often use self-reported health and disease status as an indicator of true, underlying health status. Self-reports appear to be reasonable measures of overall health. For example, self-assessed overall health has been found to be a reliable predictor of mortality. However, the validity of self-reports is questionable when investigating specific diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. A small and nascent body of research comparing self-reported status on certain diseases with the true status based on clinical diagnoses has found significant gaps. These validation exercises predominantly use data from high-income countries. In this paper, we use survey data from India to compare self-reports of disease prevalence to diagnostic tests conducted on the same individuals. We focus on hypertension and lung disease, two of the primary causes of death in India. We find that self-reported measures substantially understate the true disease burden for both conditions. The attenuation bias from using self-reports is over 80 percent for both diseases, and bigger than estimates from high-income countries. We test and reject the hypothesis that self-reports of the disease status are identical to the true disease status in expectation. We identify characteristics associated with false negative reporting (reporting not having the disease but testing positive for it) for both diseases. The large awareness gap between self-reports and true disease burden indicates multiple deficiencies in India's public health policy. The survey data depicts limited access to medical facilities, high levels of health illiteracy, low rates of health insurance, and other barriers related to poverty and lack of equity in the delivery of health services. These factors prevent timely intervention for managing health and controlling disease, invariably leading to morbidity and often to premature death."
https://openalex.org/W2889425390,"Previous studies have shown that folate levels were decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and further lowered in T2D patients with cognitive impairment. However, whether folate deficiency could cause T2D and subsequent cognitive dysfunction is still unknown. The present study aimed to explore the effects of chronic folate deficiency (CFD) on glucose and lipid metabolism and cognitive function in mice. Seven-week-old mice were fed with either a CFD or control diet for 25 weeks. Serum folate was significantly reduced, whereas serum total homocysteine was significantly increased in the CFD group. Moreover, CFD induced obesity after a 6-week diet treatment, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance after a 16-week-diet treatment. In addition, CFD reduced the hepatic p-Akt/Akt ratio in response to acute insulin administration. Moreover, CFD increased serum triglyceride levels, upregulated hepatic Acc1 and Fasn mRNA expression, and downregulated hepatic Cd36 and ApoB mRNA expression. After a 24-week diet treatment, CFD induced anxiety-related activities and impairment of spatial learning and memory performance. This study demonstrates that folate deficiency could induce obesity, glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and subsequent cognitive dysfunction."

No studies have yet been carried out on parent´s perception of their child’s vulnerability, when the child has not suffered a severe illness. This study tries to analyze the relationship between parent´s perception of their children´s vulnerability and parental competence, and analyzes the mediating role of postnatal depression and parental stress. Method The study was carried out on mothers and fathers of full-term infants who did not have any serious illnesses. A total of 965 people (385 fathers and 580 mothers) participated in the study. Results The results revealed an association between parental perception of their child’s vulnerability and parent’s perception of parental competence through depression and parental stress. However, this association was different for fathers and mothers. Conclusion The variable of perception of child’s vulnerability was a relevant factor to understand parental competence."
https://openalex.org/W2889324834,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) exerts beneficial effects, including angiogenesis and energy metabolism via the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and peroxisome-proliferator-activating receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)/estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) pathways, respectively, in astrocytes. However, evidence of cross-talk between both pathways in HO metabolite-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis has not been well elucidated. Here, we found that HIF-1α was upregulated in astrocytes after ischemic brain injury following exposure to the carbon monoxide (CO)-releasing compound CORM-2. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors and target-specific siRNAs revealed that HIF-1α levels were highly correlated with increased PGC-1α and ERRα levels, which were linked to the HO metabolites CO- and bilirubin-induced activation of apical L-type Ca2+ channel and sequential Ca2+-dependent signal transduction. Moreover, HIF-1α was stabilized in a proline hydroxylase-dependent manner by transient induction of intracellular hypoxia via the PGC-1α/ERRα-induced increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption. HIF-1α knockdown blocked HO-1 system-mediated transcriptional expression of ERRα, but not of PGC-1α, suggesting a possible involvement of HIF-1α in ERRα-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. These data suggest that the HO-1-derived metabolites, CO and bilirubin, elevate astrocytic mitochondrial function via a HIF-1α/ERRα circuit coupled with L-type Ca2+ channel activation and PGC-1α-mediated oxygen consumption. This circuit may play an important role in repairing neurovascular function after focal ischemic brain injury by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2888439550,"Since the origins of DNA-based life, the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) has spurred proliferation because of its rate-limiting role in de novo deoxynucleoside-triphosphate (dNTP) biosynthesis. Paradoxically, the large subunit, RNR-α, of this obligatory two-component complex in mammals plays a context-specific antiproliferative role. There is little explanation for this dichotomy. Here, we show that RNR-α has a previously unrecognized DNA-replication inhibition function, leading to growth retardation. This underappreciated biological activity functions in the nucleus, where RNR-α interacts with ZRANB3. This process suppresses ZRANB3's function in unstressed cells, which we show to promote DNA synthesis. This nonreductase function of RNR-α is promoted by RNR-α hexamerization-induced by a natural and synthetic nucleotide of dA/ClF/CLA/FLU-which elicits rapid RNR-α nuclear import. The newly discovered nuclear signaling axis is a primary defense against elevated or imbalanced dNTP pools that can exert mutagenic effects irrespective of the cell cycle."

GAS emm28 is the third most prevalent genotype in invasive infections in France and is associated with gyneco-obstetrical infections. emm28 strains harbor R28, a cell wall–anchored surface protein that has previously been reported to promote adhesion to cervical epithelial cells. Here, using cellular and biochemical approaches, we sought to determine whether R28 supports adhesion also to other cells and to characterize its cognate receptor. We show that through its N-terminal domain, R28Nt, R28 promotes bacterial adhesion to both endometrial–epithelial and endometrial–stromal cells. R28Nt was further subdivided into two domains, and we found that both are involved in cell binding. R28Nt and both subdomains interacted directly with the laminin-binding α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4 integrins; interestingly, these bindings events did not require divalent cations. R28 is the first GAS adhesin reported to bind directly to integrins that are expressed in most epithelial cells. Finally, R28Nt also promoted binding to keratinocytes and pulmonary epithelial cells, suggesting that it may be involved in supporting the prevalence in invasive infections of the emm28 genotype. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a human-specific pathogen responsible for a wide range of diseases, ranging from superficial to life-threatening invasive infections, including endometritis, and autoimmune sequelae. GAS strains express a vast repertoire of virulence factors that varies depending on the strain genotype, and many adhesin proteins that enable GAS to adhere to host cells are restricted to some genotypes.

This remarkable tissue association together with the high prevalence of emm28 strain invasive infections prompted us to study the role of R28, an RD2 encoded surface protein, in GAS emm28 infections. Adhesion to host tissues is the initial step for all GAS infections. It is mediated by different factors, mainly surface proteins, that bind either extracellular matrix components, indirectly to the cell surface through plasmatic or extracellular matrix components bridging or directly to eukaryotic receptors (reviewed in Refs. 16.Nobbs A.H.

RD2 encodes four surface proteins including R28, and a R28-deficient emm28 strain is nonadherent to the cervical cell line ME180 (18.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T. Larsson C. Lindahl G.

These chimeric proteins are composed of a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain, repeats, and an LPXTG anchoring motif. The repeat number varies among clinical isolates, and their structure is related to the Ig-like fold (22.Callebaut I. Gilgès D. Vigon I. Mornon J.P.

The repeats are identical within one protein and the identity percentage between Alp members varies between 35 and 94, the latter being between Rib and R28 repeats. Repeats are considered to properly expose the N-terminal domain at the bacterial surface, potentially the functional domain (21.Lindahl G. Stålhammer-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T.

This domain is composed of one module for ACP and Rib, two modules for R28, and three modules for Alp2. The first modules of R28 and Alp2 share 99% identity and are 70 and 56% identical to the module of ACP and Rib, respectively.

In this study, we analyzed the capacity of R28 to promote adhesion to host cells and characterized the adhesion domain. We demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of R28 (R28Nt) is sufficient to promote direct adhesion to different gyneco-obstetrical cell lines and further identified two subdomains within R28Nt that are both involved in this adhesion process. We then characterized the chemical nature of the R28Nt receptor and isolated different ligands. We show that R28Nt interacts with the laminin-binding integrins α3β1, α6β1, and α6β4. Finally, we show that R28Nt increases adhesion also to skin and pulmonary cells, further extending the role of R28 as a GAS adhesin involved in GAS emm28 prevalence. Association of GAS emm28 strains with gyneco-obstetrical infections could be a consequence of its capacity to colonize the vaginal tract (10.Plainvert C. Doloy A. Loubinoux J. Lepoutre A.

A GAS R28-deleted mutant adheres less than the parental strain to cells from the cervical ME180 lineage (18.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T. Larsson C. Lindahl G. The R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is related to several group B streptococcal surface proteins, confers protective immunity and promotes binding to human epithelial cells.Mol.

To assay the role of R28 in a more physiological situation, we tested whether the phenotype could also be observed on human decidual stromal cells (hDSCs) isolated from decidual biopsy of specimens obtained after caesarian delivery (Fig. 2A). The decidua is the lining of the uterine during pregnancy and consists of differentiated endometrial stromal fibroblasts and recruited leukocytes. It may be a direct target of GAS infection, a major cause of severe puerperal sepsis. The R28-deleted strain adhered significantly less (18%) to hDSCs than the WT strain (Fig. 2A), confirming the role of R28 as an adhesin on physiologically relevant cells. We then sought to characterize the adhesion domain of the R28 protein using different cells from the female genital tract, hDSCs as well as two cell lineages, cervical cells (ME180), often used to study female genital tract infections, and endometrial epithelial cells (HEC-1-A). The 6–17 highly conserved 79-residue-long repeats of R28 are considered to expose the 368-residue-long N-terminal domain at the bacterial surface, potentially the functional domain (Fig. 1A) (18.Stålhammar-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T. Larsson C. Lindahl G. The R28 protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is related to several group B streptococcal surface proteins, confers protective immunity and promotes binding to human epithelial cells.Mol.

Consequently, to analyze the ability of R28 to promote adhesion to various cells, we focused on the N-terminal domain of R28, R28Nt, using biotinylated R28Nt (Fig. 2, B–D). R28Nt displays higher binding capacity to hDSC, ME180, and HEC-1-A cells than soluble BSA (200, 10, and 10 times more binding at 10 μm, respectively). To confirm the capacity of R28Nt to promote adhesion, we tested whether R28Nt-coated beads or a heterologous bacterium expressing R28Nt could bind more to HEC-1-A cells than the controls (Fig. 2, E–I). R28Nt-coated beads adhered three times more than the BSA-coated control beads (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, E–G), and this binding was blocked by the addition of purified R28Nt antibodies (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2H). Also, the Lactococcus lactis strain expressing R28Nt (Fig. S1A) adhered significantly more than the control strain harboring the empty vector (+35%, p = 0.0066) (Fig. 2H). The increased adherence may seem weak. However, in the absence of the repeats, R28Nt may be poorly exposed at the L. lactis cell surface or hidden by the protective polysaccharide pellicle (30.Chapot-Chartier M.P. Vinogradov E.

Thus, the N-terminal domain of R28 is sufficient to increase the adherence of a Gram-positive bacterium to endometrial cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that R28Nt promotes bacterial adhesion to female genital tract cells. The R28Nt domain is composed of two halves: amino acid residues 56–229 and residues 230–424, which we termed R28-N1 and R28-N2, respectively (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B (21.Lindahl G. Stålhammer-Carlemalm M. Areschoug T. Surface proteins of Streptococcus agalactiae and related proteins in other bacterial pathogens.Clin. Microbiol.

To test which subdomain mediates adhesion, we produced and purified the corresponding peptides (Fig. S1, B and C) and incubated them after biotinylation with ME180 and HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Both the R28-N1 and R28-N2 subdomains showed significant binding with both cell types compared with BSA (p < 0.001 for both cell types), with R28-N2 displaying an affinity 2–3-fold higher than that of R28-N1 (Fig. 3C). The R28-N1 and R28-N2 binding values indicate an additive contribution of R28-N1 and R28-N2 to the R28Nt binding on HEC-1-A cells and a synergetic one on ME180 cells (Fig. 3C). To assess the binding of these subdomains in more physiological conditions, we tested whether R28-N1– and R28-N2–coated beads bound HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 3D). Twenty-seven % and 19% of R28-N1– and R28-N2–coated beads bound to HEC-1-A cells, respectively, a percentage significantly higher than BSA-coated beads (6.3%, p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 for R28-N1 and R28-N2 with HEC-1-A cells, respectively). We checked the binding specificity of the coated beads by incubating cells with an excess amount of soluble peptides (20 μm) and assessing the percentage of beads still bound to cells (Fig. 3D). Purified R28-N1 and R28-N2 peptides competed with their respective coated beads (6.3 and 4.5% versus 27 and 19%, for R28-N1 and R28-N2, respectively), confirming the binding specificity. Altogether, these data clearly indicate that both the R28-N1 and R28-N2 subdomains are sufficient to promote adhesion to HEC-1-A cells. We then sought to determine whether R28-N1 and R28-N2 have independent receptors. We performed competition assays in which we assessed the percentages of R28-N1– and R28-N2–coated beads bound to cells preincubated with excess amounts (20 μm) of soluble R28-N2 and R28-N1, respectively (Fig. 3D). These subdomains compete with one another (p < 0.005), suggesting that these subdomains share common receptor(s). Moreover, both displaced R28Nt-coated beads, lowering its binding level to unspecific binding level (BSA-coated beads, 6%), further supporting that R28-N1 and R28-N2 share a common receptor.

We focused on the shared N-terminal domains of these proteins, leaving out from ACPNt the region binding glycosaminoglycans. A BLAST alignment indicated that R28-N1 is 70 and 56% identical to the N-terminal domains of ACP and Rib, respectively (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a Phyre analysis predicted, with a confidence of 100%, that R28-N1 has the same structure as ACP, that is two domains, an N-terminal β-sandwich, sharing structural elements with the type III fibronectin fold and a C-terminal three-helix bundle (Fig. 1B) (24.Aupérin T.C.

https://openalex.org/W2889026486,"Primary cilia are solitary organelles that emanate from the plasma membrane during growth arrest in almost all mammalian cells. The canonical Hedgehog (HH) pathway requires trafficking of the G protein-coupled receptor SMOOTHENED (SMO) and the GLI transcription factors to the primary cilium upon binding of a HH ligand to PATCHED1. However, it is unknown if activation of the small GTPase RHOA by SMO coupling to heterotrimeric Gi proteins, a form of non-canonical HH signaling, requires localization of SMO in the primary cilium. In this study, we compared RHOA and Gi protein stimulation by activation of SMO or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) receptors in WT and KIF3A-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack primary cilia. We found that activation of SMO in response to Sonic HH (SHH) or purmorphamine (PUR), a small molecule agonist of SMO, stimulates Gi proteins and RHOA independently of the presence of primary cilia, similar to the effects of S1P. However, while S1P induced a fast activation of AKT that is sensitive to the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin, HH pathway activators did not significantly activate AKT, suggesting that RHOA activation is not downstream of AKT. Our findings demonstrate that early events in some forms of non-canonical HH signaling occur in extraciliary membranes, which might be particularly relevant for actively-cycling cells, for some cancers characterized by loss of primary cilia, and in ciliopathies."

The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction among occupational psychosocial hazards and the impact of metabolic syndrome (MetS) on the risk of CVD among bus drivers. The Taiwan Bus Driver Cohort Study involving 1014 professional drivers was established in 2005 and comprehensively studied. The interactions among occupational psychosocial hazards and the impact of MetS on the risk of CVD were measured. A working pattern questionnaire, job stress questionnaires, the Swedish occupational fatigue inventory, the stress satisfaction offset score, biochemical measurements, and physical examinations were used to assess psychosocial hazards and the presence of metabolic syndrome. There were 707 eligible bus drivers with a mean age of 43.5years old. During the 8-years of follow-up, 77 drivers were diagnosed with CVD. Long working hours, high job stress, and high fatigue were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease incidence in the multivariate analysis. There were synergistic effects among long working hours, high job stress, and high fatigue only in drivers with MetS. A combination of long working hours, high job stress, and high fatigue increased the risk of developing CVD in bus drivers with MetS."

As the biosynthesis of such compounds may be influenced by growth conditions, the current research assesses wheatgrass composition in soil based and hydroponic systems, using water with different elemental composition. FTIR spectroscopy did not reveal significant variations between juice and extracts cultivated in different setups. Surface elemental composition indicated higher Na, P, Si concentrations in hydroponic plants, while AAS analyses showed increased Ca and Mn in soil presence. HPLC-MS of extracts showed that soil and spring water increased chlorophyll and hydroxychlorophyll a concentrations. Phenolic contents were higher in hydroponic plants, while maximum values were recorded for spring water. Radical scavenging activity was stimulated by the use of spring water. Results indicate that wheatgrass with improved mineral and macromolecular composition may be obtained using accessible cultivation setups."
https://openalex.org/W2889029389,"Linear description (LD) of conformation traits was introduced in horse breeding to minimise subjectivity in scoring. However, recent studies have shown that LD traits show essentially the same problems as traditionally scored traits, such as data converging around the mean value with very small standard deviations. To improve the assessment of conformation traits of horses, we investigated the application of the recently described horse shape space model based upon 403 digitised photographs of 243 Franches-Montagnes (FM) stallions and extracted joint angles based on specific landmark triplets. Repeatability, reproducibility and consistency of the resulting shape data and joint angles were assessed with Procrustes ANOVA (Rep) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Furthermore, we developed a subjective score to classify the posture of the horses on each photograph. We derived relative warp scores (PCs) based upon the digitised photos conducting a principal component analysis (PCA). The PCs of the shapes and joint angles were compared to the posture scores and to the linear description data using linear mixed effect models including significant posture scores as random factors. The digitisation process was highly repeatable and reproducible for the shape (Rep = 0.72–0.99, ICC = 0.99). The consistency of the shape was limited by the age and posture (p < 0.05). The angle measurements were highly repeatable within one digitiser. Between digitisers, we found a higher variability of ICC values (ICC = 0.054–0.92), indicating digitising error in specific landmarks (e.g. shoulder point). The posture scores were highly repeatable (Fleiss’ kappa = 0.713–0.857). We identified significant associations (p(X2) < 0.05) with traits describing the withers height, shoulder length and incline, overall leg conformation, walk and trot step length. The horse shape data and angles provide additional information to explore the morphology of horses and therefore can be applied to improve the knowledge of the genetic architecture of LD traits."
https://openalex.org/W2889150495,"Objective A mortality sample of white American male and female skeletons was examined to illustrate a simple means of identifying skeletal conditions associated with an increased risk of dying relatively early in adulthood and to determine if males and females with Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis (DISH) displayed the same general age-specific pattern of mortality. Methods Age-specific probability distributions for DISH were generated from 416 white Americans who died from the 1980s to the present, and whose remains were donated to the University of Tennessee Forensic Anthropology Center. The age-specific frequency of DISH is analyzed using an empirical smoothing algorithm. Doing so allows for the identification of deviations (i.e., local maxima) from monotonically increasing age-specific probabilities. Results In females (N = 199), there is a peak in the frequency of individuals with DISH around 60 years of age where 37.0% of the individuals have DISH. It is matched only by the frequency (38.7%) in the oldest females, those over 85 years old. In contrast, DISH frequencies for males (N = 217) increase monotonically with advancing age, reaching 62.5% in the ≥86 years age group. There was an association between DISH and high body weight in women, particularly those who died before they reached the age of 75. Conclusions Early-onset DISH in white American women is associated with an increased risk of dying indicated by a local maximum in the probability curve. Should this finding be replicated in additional mortality samples and the reason DISH is associated with early death is established, beyond being heavy, this radiologically visible ossification of the spine could be a potential component of health-monitoring programs for middle-aged women."
https://openalex.org/W2889397613,"Macrophages play important roles in linking alterations of cholesterol metabolism and inflammation to the development of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have identified several positive and negative crosstalk mechanisms that connect cholesterol efflux and inflammation at the transcriptional level. Of particular relevance is that the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), a main regulator of cholesterol efflux, can be induced by oxysterol receptor LXR agonists but also by bacterial endotoxins, such as LPS, that activate TLR4 signaling. However, the extent to which these pathways influence each other has remained incompletely understood. We investigated the possible role of the transcriptional coregulator G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) in LPS-induced Abca1 expression and cholesterol efflux in mouse and human macrophages. To activate Abca1, GPS2 cooperates with the LPS-inducible NF-κB subunit p65, but not with LXRs nor with corepressor complex subunits that otherwise cooperate with GPS2 to repress proinflammatory gene expression. Overall, our work identifies a regulatory chromatin component of crosstalk mechanisms between cholesterol efflux and inflammation that specifically affects ABCA1. Because GPS2 expression is down-regulated in some humans with obese and type 2 diabetes, the macrophage GPS-2/ABC-A1 pathway could be altered and contribute to atherogenesis.—Huang, Z., Liang, N., Damdimopoulos, A., Fan, R., Treuter, E.

In this study, we used ISSR and SRAP molecular markers to analyze the genetic diversity of 72 samples of L. nuda from eight populations in Northeast China. In total, six ISSR primers and five pairs of SRAP primers that produced clear and polymorphic banding profiles were selected for assessing L. nuda genetic diversity. The results revealed a high level of genetic variation among the 72 samples (94.4% polymorphism) but a low degree of gene flow among the populations. Among L. nuda populations, genetic distance was not correlated significantly with geographic distance. The antioxidant activity of the samples from each population was also tested and the result showed that all the selected samples had more than 60% DPPH scavenging activities. Nonetheless, the antioxidant activity diversity is not coincident with both the genetic diversity and the geographic distribution. The results indicate that ISSR and SRAP molecular markers are useful for studying the genetic diversity of L. nuda. The results also suggest that L. nuda populations in Northeast China require protection."
https://openalex.org/W2889370448,"It is suggested that most cases of low back pain are related to degeneration of intervertebral discs. Disc degeneration is a chronic and progressive disease and the search for effective medical treatments continues. Neurotropin is widely used in Japan and China to treat low back pain and neck–shoulder–arm syndrome. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of Neurotropin on glycosaminoglycan synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. Cultured human nucleus pulposus cells were treated with Neurotropin every second day for two weeks. Production of glycosaminoglycan was assessed using a dimethyl-methylene blue assay and PicoGreen was used to measure DNA content. Microarray analysis, real-time PCR, and western blotting were performed to assess the biological processes related to Neurotropin-stimulated glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The results showed that the level of glycosaminoglycan normalized to DNA content was significantly upregulated by the addition of Neurotropin. Gene expression profiling showed over two-fold upregulation of 697 genes in response to Neurotropin treatment. Among these genes, ontological analysis suggested significant implication of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, and analysis focused on this pathway demonstrated marked upregulation of angiopoietin 1 and insulin-like growth factor 1. Activation of phosphorylation of the signal transducer protein AKT was detected by western blotting. Of the genes related to sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis, the greatest increase in mRNA levels was observed for chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, an enzyme initiating synthesis of chondroitin sulfate side chains attached to a core protein of aggrecan, which is a predominant disc matrix component. These findings suggest that Neurotropin may activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT pathway and stimulate glycosaminoglycan synthesis through upregulation of expression of mRNA for chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1. Because there was no cytotoxic cellular growth inhibition, Neurotropin treatment might offer an accessible therapeutic strategy for intervertebral disc degeneration."

Nevertheless, to date no extensive reports exist about the effectiveness of different available PPE on farms. Thus, our aim was to estimate the degree of protection of PPE from viral contamination during farm visits. Two farms, infected with Aleutian mink disease virus and porcine circovirus-2 respectively, were visited by six visitors wearing different combinations of PPE: coveralls with hood and bootcovers, both with a certified barrier to infective agents (certified PPE group) and non-certified bootcover and coverall without hood (non-certified PPE group). Seventy-two swab samples from PPE and both hair and street clothes under PPE were taken after the visit and analysed by qPCR. Our results reveal viral exposure during visits, and the external protections of body and shoes were contaminated in all cases (24/24). In addition, protection from viral contamination varied noticeably according to the biosecurity elements used. A higher number of positives were detected in the non-certified PPE group than in the certified PPE group, both in elements under external protections (14/18 vs 3/18) and also in hair (4/6 vs 0/6). In fact, non-certified bootcovers broke during visits, resulting in viral contamination of the internal elements under them; these are consequently not suitable for using with wrinkled surfaces usually found in farm facilities. Thus, certified coveralls should be used in order to prevent contaminations, and workers and personnel of farms should be trained in their proper use. qPCR is a useful tool in the risk management of biosecurity programmes, and our results may serve as a model to evaluate different biosecurity measures."
https://openalex.org/W2889225202,"Recent findings have indicated that secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) have anti-inflammatory functions, including relief of symptoms in a mouse model of mastitis. This prompted us to investigate the therapeutic application of sPLA2, PLA2G1B, for bovine mastitis. Initial testing of PLA2G1B's effect on bovine mammary epithelial cell (bMEC) line PS revealed no changes in cell viability or cytokine-secretion pattern. However, when cells were first treated with lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) or live bacteria (Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus), incubation with PLA2G1B significantly improved cell viability, suggesting involvement of sPLA2s in protecting membranes from lipid-peroxidation damage, rather than a bactericidal action. When PLA2G1B was applied simultaneously with LPS, a significant short-term reduction in interleukin-8 secretion was observed compared with bMECs treated only with LPS, supporting previous reports that PLA2G1B affects interleukin-8 signaling in similar cells. Following the favorable outcome of the in vitro experiments, we tested PLA2G1B in vivo by mammary infusion into infected glands. In one of a small sample (n = 4) of lactating cows chronically infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a single PLA2G1B treatment completely cleared inflammation and bacteria, demonstrating its potential to cure subclinical mastitis. PLA2G1B treatment did not affect coagulase-negative staphylococci infection. These types of mastitis may involve formation of a resistant biofilm, and its elimination may relate to sPLA2s' characteristic ability to aggregate with cellular debris, facilitating their internalization by macrophages. In a bovine model of clinical mastitis based on introduction of E. coli via the streak canal, a single mammary infusion of PLA2G1B led to faster recovery to pre-infection milk-yield levels and decrease of somatic cell counts. In this case, all of sPLA2s' modes of resolving inflammation may apply, including competitive binding of the sPLA2s' receptor, the inactivation of which confers resistance to endotoxic shock. Hence, this study strongly supports further research into PLA2G1B as a cure for bovine mastitis."
https://openalex.org/W2888833687,"One way to understand the ecology of bird migration is to analyze how birds use their ecological niche during their annual cycle. Ammodramus bairdii is a grassland specialist sparrow that breeds in southern Canada and the northern U.S.A. and winters in the Chihuahuan Desert. A continuous and alarming decrease of its populations has been observed over the last 50 years, and studying its seasonal distribution and associated climatic niches could help improve strategies for its conservation. We analyzed the temporal use of its Grinnellian niche (GN) -set of environmental conditions under which a species can establish and persist; in this case the climatic attributes-. We modeled the GN for the reproductive and winter seasons and projected them onto each other (inter-prediction), and also onto transient migratory periods. To measure niche breadth and their overlap, minimum convex polygons (MCP) were calculated for the climatic space. The niches of each of the two seasons were tested for similarity using the PCA axes of climatic variables. The geographic areas with optimal, suboptimal and marginal conditions were identified, based on the distance to the centroid of the GN. The models for each season revealed no geographic inter-prediction among them, with the exception of winter to migratory seasons. The niche breadth of the winter was greater than that of the reproductive season, with an overlap of 22.47% and 45.18%, respectively. The similarity analyses showed a value of zero between seasons. The climate conditions for the records during the migratory months corresponded with suboptimal and marginal conditions of the sparrow’s winter niche. These results suggest that A. bairdii uses different climate conditions within ecological niches of each season during its migratory cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2889219968,"Background Glassware design may affect drinking behaviour for alcoholic beverages, with glass shape and size influencing drinking speed and amount consumed. Uncertainty remains both about the extent to which these effects are restricted to alcohol and the underlying mechanisms. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the effect of differently shaped glasses on time taken to drink a soft drink. The secondary aim was to develop hypotheses about mechanisms concerning micro-drinking behaviours and perceptual effects. Method In a single-session experiment, 162 participants were randomised to receive 330ml of carbonated apple juice in a glass that was either inward-sloped, straight-sided, or outward-sloped. The primary outcome measure was total drinking time. Secondary outcome measures included micro-drinking behaviours (sip size, sip duration, interval duration), and perceptual measures (midpoint bias, drink enjoyment). Results Participants drank 21.4% faster from the outward-sloped glass than from the straight-sided glass [95%CI: 0.2%,38.0%] in adjusted models. They were also 18.2% faster from the inward-sloped glass than the straight-sided glass, but this did not reach statistical significance with wide confidence intervals also consistent with slower drinking [95%CI: -3.8%,35.6%]. Larger sips were associated with faster drinking times (Pearson’s r(162) = -.45, p < .001). The direction of effects suggested sips were larger from the outward-sloped and inward-sloped glasses, compared to the straight-sided glass (15.1%, 95%CI: -4.3%,38.0%; 19.4%, 95%CI: -0.5%,43.6%, respectively). There were no significant differences between glasses in mean sip or interval duration. Bias in midpoint estimation was greater for the outward-sloped glass (12.9ml, 95%CI: 6.6ml,19.2ml) than for the straight-sided glass, although the degree of bias was not associated with total drinking time (Pearson’s r(162) = 0.01, p = .87). Discussion Individuals drank a soft drink more quickly from an outward-sloped glass, relative to a straight-sided glass. Micro-drinking behaviours, such as sip size, are promising candidates for underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2888971290,"We present a method to efficiently separate signal in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into a base signal S0, representing the mainly T1-weighted component without T2*-relaxation, and its T2*-weighted counterpart by the rapid acquisition of multiple contrasts for advanced pharmacokinetic modelling. This is achieved by incorporating simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging into a multi-contrast, segmented echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence to allow extended spatial coverage, which covers larger body regions without time penalty. Simultaneous acquisition of four slices was combined with segmented EPI for fast imaging with three gradient echo times in a preclinical perfusion study. Six female domestic pigs, German-landrace or hybrid-form, were scanned for 11 minutes respectively during administration of gadolinium-based contrast agent. Influences of reconstruction methods and training data were investigated. The separation into T1- and T2*-dependent signal contributions was achieved by fitting a standard analytical model to the acquired multi-echo data. The application of SMS yielded sufficient temporal resolution for the detection of the arterial input function in major vessels, while anatomical coverage allowed perfusion analysis of muscle tissue. The separation of the MR signal into T1- and T2*-dependent components allowed the correction of susceptibility related changes. We demonstrate a novel sequence for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI that meets the requirements of temporal resolution (Δt < 1.5 s) and image quality. The incorporation of SMS into multi-contrast, segmented EPI can overcome existing limitations of dynamic contrast enhancement and dynamic susceptibility contrast methods, when applied separately. The new approach allows both techniques to be combined in a single acquisition with a large spatial coverage."

https://openalex.org/W2889228463,"Purpose To evaluate B-mode ultrasound as a novel method for objective and quantitative assessment of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in a prospective case-control study. Methods Seventeen patients with unilateral optic neuropathy and a clinically detectable RAPD and 17 age and sex matched healthy controls were examined with B-mode ultrasound using an Esaote-Mylab25 system according to current guidelines for orbital insonation. The swinging flashlight test was performed during ultrasound assessment with a standardized light stimulus using a penlight. Results B-mode ultrasound RAPD examination was doable in approximately 5 minutes only and was well tolerated by all participants. Compared to the unaffected contralateral eyes, eyes with RAPD showed lower absolute constriction amplitude of the pupillary diameter (mean [SD] 0.8 [0.4] vs. 2.1 [0.4] mm; p = 0.009) and a longer pupillary constriction time after ipsilateral light stimulus (mean [SD] 1240 [180] vs. 710 [200] ms; p = 0.008). In eyes affected by RAPD, visual acuity correlated with the absolute constriction amplitude (r = 0.75, p = 0.001). Conclusions B-mode ultrasound enables fast, easy and objective quantification of a RAPD and can thus be applied in clinical practice to document a RAPD."
https://openalex.org/W2889461540,"Introduction Parents have a major impact on the outcome of health care of preterm infants. Parents’ engagement in meaningful activities could have an impact on their own health and wellbeing and therefore be relevant in neonatal intensive care. The aim of this study was to explore meaningful activities of parents of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants with the purpose to further the understanding of their clinical relevance and to foster their consideration in clinical practice and research of neonatal intensive care. Methods A total of 36 parents of preterm infants born prior to complete 37 weeks of gestation with VLBW (≤1.500 grams) were asked to participate in a focus group interview. Interview transcripts were used to analyse the content of the focus group interviews using meaning condensation method by Steinar Kvale. Results Thirty-six parents participated in a total of twelve focus groups. Parents reported that the meaning of certain activities changed due to preterm birth. Meaningful activities, like bathing the baby and gardening, could foster a transition from a feeling of parental immaturity to a feeling of maturity, following health care instructions to possessing health care skills, and a functioning-only state to a balance of activities. Conclusions In neonatal intensive care, nurses contribute to delivering parental education and thereby facilitate experiences of being a mature parent and of possessing health care skills. Occupational therapy could be used to help re-engage in meaningful activities and maintain a balance of activities in parents of VLBW preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2888885240,"Background Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU). There is concern regarding the rise in prevalence of M. genitalium and rates of resistance to macrolide antibiotics. International backpackers represent a unique population that may be at an increased risk of STIs. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of M. genitalium and antibiotic resistance in international backpackers. Methods First void urine samples were obtained utilising opportunistic sampling from 294 non-treatment-seeking international backpackers at a variety of hostels in Cairns, Queensland Australia. Participants also answered a fixed-answer survey regarding sociodemographic characteristics and sexual risk behaviours. Samples were tested for M. genitalium, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples positive for M. genitalium were investigated for macrolide resistance-associated mutations in the 23S rRNA genome at positions A2058G, A2058C, A2058T, A2059G and A2059C (Escherichia coli numbering). Results Of the 294 samples, 23 failed the internal control. The prevalence of M. genitalium was 1.8% (5/271, 95% confidence interval [CI] ± 1.58), C. trachomatis was 4.1% (11/271, 95% CI ± 2.36) and N. gonorrhoeae was not detected. Macrolide resistance-associated mutations were identified in 40% (2/5) of M. genitalium-positive samples. M. genitalium infection was associated with reporting symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 14.36, 95% CI 2.17–94.94, p < 0.05). Conclusions M. genitalium and C. trachomatis are relatively common amongst non-treatment seeking international backpackers, but may not differ from Australian population prevalence. This article provides evidence to further support the increased utilisation of M. genitalium PCR in the diagnosis of NGU, and for macrolide resistance testing for all identified M. genitalium infections."
https://openalex.org/W2889121900,"Porphyromonas gingivalis possesses various abilities to evade and disrupt host immune responses, by which it acts as an important periodontal pathogen. P. gingivalis produces outer membrane protein A (OmpA)-like proteins (OmpALPs), Pgm6 and Pgm7, as major O-linked glycoproteins, but their pathological roles in P. gingivalis infection are largely unknown. Here, we report that OmpALP-deficient strains of P. gingivalis show an enhanced stimulatory activity in coculture with host cells. Such an altered ability of the OmpALP-deficient strains was found to be due to their impaired survival in coculture and the release of LPS from dead bacterial cells to stimulate Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Further analyses revealed that the OmpALP-deficient strains were inviable in serum-containing media although they grew normally in the bacterial medium. The wild-type strain was able to grow in 90% normal human serum, while the OmpALP-deficient strains did not survive even at 5%. The OmpALP-deficient strains did not survive in heat-inactivated serum, but they gained the ability to survive and grow in proteinase K-treated serum. Of note, the sensitivity of the OmpALP-deficient strains to the bactericidal activity of human β-defensin 3 was increased as compared with the WT. Thus, this study suggests that OmpALPs Pgm6 and Pgm7 are important for serum resistance of P. gingivalis. These proteins prevent bacterial cell destruction by serum and innate immune recognition by TLR4; this way, P. gingivalis may adeptly colonize serum-containing gingival crevicular fluids and subgingival environments."
https://openalex.org/W2889246332,"To investigate the relationship between dry weight (DW) change and survival in long-term maintenance prevalent dialysis patients.We conducted a prospective data collection study with retrospective analysis of the registered data. Patients were followed up for 5 years (1-year observation of DW changes and subsequent 4-year follow-up). The outcome was all-cause mortality. The predictors were 1-year DW change rates. The hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality were calculated using multivariable Cox regression analysis, fully adjusted for age, sex, basal kidney disease, dialysis vintage, current smoking, past cardiovascular events, serum albumin, DW at enrollment, serum creatinine, mean predialysis systolic blood pressure, and cardiothoracic ratio or 1-year cardiothoracic ratio change rate. Propensity score (PS) analysis was also conducted using the same covariates of Cox regression analysis.In total, 899 dialysis patients (mean dialysis vintage: 101.2 months) were followed up, and 180 deaths were recorded, of which 90 were of cardiovascular origin. Each 2% decrement of DW showed adjusted HR, and the 95% confidence interval was 1.24 [1.16-1.33]. According to the 1-year DW change rate, participants were divided into five groups (group A, ≥+3%; group B, +1 to +2.9%; group C, -0.9 to +0.9%; group D, -2.9 to -1.0%; and group E, ≤-3%). For survival curves based on grouping, group B had the best and group E had the worst survival rate (p<0.01, log-rank test). Therefore, we set group B as a reference; adjusted risks for death of groups D and E were 2.16 [1.23-3.79] and 2.66 [1.54-4.58], respectively. However, this relation was blunted in patients of heavier DW. The PS-matched cohort showed a poorer prognosis in patients with diminishing DW divided by DW change rate at -0.635% (mean value of DW change rate).In the long-term maintenance hemodialysis cohort, 1-year DW decrement, especially ≤-3.0%, was significantly associated with all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease-related death was prominent in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2889479815,"Excessive use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer and lower nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) are threatening the wheat production in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River. Excess input of N fertilizers also results in severe environmental pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. However, the study on reasonable nitrogen application and NUE improvement with the prerequisite of stable and high yield remains unexplored. In our study, the four different levels of nitrogen were applied to find out the nitrogen threshold which could be both friendly to environment and promise the stable and high yield. The experiment was carried out in Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, China). The wheat cultivar Yangmai 23 was selected as the research material. The four nitrogen levels were as follows: 0, 189, 229.5, and 270 kg ha-1. The results showed that the grain yield under the application of 229.5 kg ha-1 N was as high as that under 270 kg ha-1 N level, with the observation of 20.3% increase in agronomic efficiency. The N2O emission of 229.5 kg ha-1 N application was as low as that of 189 kg ha-1 N, but the grain yield and agronomic efficiency were significantly higher (11.9%) under 229.5 kg ha-1 treatment than the lower one. Taken together, this indicated the nitrogen level at 229.5 kg ha-1 could be identified as the fertilizer threshold, which will be beneficial for the future fieldwork."

However, the magnitude of this false increase, and the means to reverse it have not been investigated.To evaluate the technical and clinical impact of hydroquinone-containing creams on capillary glycemia and investigate the efficacy of hand washing and other common practices, in reversing cream effects.We included 91 participants in a quasi-experimental study in Buea, Cameroon. After determining the hydroquinone content of a cream, Caro Light, we used two glucometers with different enzymatic systems (Accu-Chek Active and OneTouch Ultra 2) to measure fasting glycemia after: initial hand washing (reference), application of 1 ml of hydroquinone-containing cream, finger swabbing with wet gauze, sanitizer application and a series of three hand washings following cream application. Reference glycemia was compared to those obtained after various interventions. Statistical significance was assessed by paired sample t-test, clinical significance by total error allowable (TEa), and clinical impact by Parke's error grid analysis.The mean differences in capillary glycemia (Intervention-reference) measured by Accu-Chek Active in mg/dl were 28, 27, 38, 16, 4, and -2 after cream application, finger swabbing, sanitizer application, one, two, and three hand washings respectively. Corresponding values for OneTouch Ultra2 were 41, 44, 64, 22, 5 and -5. These differences, except after two and three hand washings were both statistically (p < 0.0001) and clinically significant (TEa). After cream application, Accu-Check had 9.9% of values in Parke's Zones C-E, while OneTouch had 18.7%.Hydroquinone-containing creams cause significant false increase in capillary glycemia irrespective of the enzymatic system of the glucometer used, and can lead to potentially wrong clinical decisions. A minimum of two hand washings is required prior to capillary glucose measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2889230746,"As a frontier topic of soft condensed matter physics, irreversible aggregation has drawn attention for a better understanding of the complex behavior of biomaterials. In this study, we have described the synthesis of an artificial amphiphilic molecule, an alternating tetra-block-like amphiphile, which was able to diversify its aggregate structure in water. The aggregated state of its aqueous dispersion was obtained by slow evaporation of the organic solvent at room temperature, and it collapsed irreversibly at ~ 50°C. By using a cryo-transmission electron microscope and a differential scanning calorimeter, it was revealed that two types of molecular nanostructures were formed and developed into submicro- and micrometer-sized fibrils in the aggregated material."
https://openalex.org/W2888939029,"Team formation, which aims to form a team to complete a given task by covering its required skills, furnishes a natural way to help organizers complete projects effectively. In this work, we propose a new team hiring problem. Given a set of projects [Formula: see text] with required skills, and a pool of experts [Formula: see text], each of which has his own skillset, compensation demand and participation constraint (i.e., the maximum number of projects the expert can participate in simultaneously), we seek to hire a team of participation-constrained experts [Formula: see text] to complete all the projects so that the overall compensation is minimized. We refer to this as the participation constrained team hire problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate the problem. We also study a special case of the problem, where the number of projects is within the participation constraint of each expert and design an exact algorithm for it. Since participation constrained team hire problem is proven to be NP-hard, we design three novel efficient approximate algorithms as its solution, each of which focuses on a particular perspective of the problem. We perform extensive experimental studies, on both synthetic and real datasets, to evaluate the performance of our algorithms. Experimental results show that our exact algorithm far surpasses the brute-force solutions and works well in practice. Besides, the three algorithms behave differently when distinct facets of the problem are involved."
