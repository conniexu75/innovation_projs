https://openalex.org/W1989878476,"Introduction This study explores factors associated with virological detectability, and viral re-suppression after enhanced adherence counselling, in adults and children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Swaziland. Methods This descriptive study used laboratory data from 7/5/2012 to 30/9/2013, which were linked with the national ART database to provide information on time on ART and CD4 count; information on enhanced adherence counselling was obtained from file review in health facilities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between viral load, gender, age, time on ART, CD4 count and receiving (or not receiving) enhanced adherence counselling. Results From 12,063 patients undergoing routine viral load monitoring, 1941 (16%) had detectable viral loads. Children were more likely to have detectable viral loads (AOR 2.6, 95%CI 1.5–4.5), as were adolescents (AOR 3.2, 95%CI 2.2–4.8), patients with last CD4<350 cells/µl (AOR 2.2, 95%CI 1.7–2.9) or WHO Stage 3/4 disease (AOR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1–1.6), and patients on ART for longer (AOR 1.1, 95%CI 1.1–1.2). At retesting, 450 (54% of those tested) showed viral re-suppression. Children were less likely to re-suppress (AOR 0.2, 95%CI 0.1–0.7), as were adolescents (AOR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2–0.8), those with initial viral load> 1000 copies/ml (AOR 0.3, 95%CI 0.1–0.7), and those with last CD4<350 cells/µl (AOR 0.4, 95%CI 0.2–0.7). Receiving (or not receiving) enhanced adherence counselling was not associated with likelihood of re-suppression. Conclusions Children, adolescents and those with advanced disease were most likely to have high viral loads and least likely to achieve viral suppression at retesting; receiving adherence counselling was not associated with higher likelihood of viral suppression. Although the level of viral resistance was not quantified, this study suggests the need for ART treatment support that addresses the adherence problems of younger people; and to define the elements of optimal enhanced adherence support for patients of all ages with detectable viral loads."
https://openalex.org/W2122847075,"Background The Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem) was developed with the aim to improve the quality of diagnostic work-up, treatment and care of patients with dementia disorders in Sweden. Methods SveDem is an internet based quality registry where several indicators can be followed over time. It includes information about the diagnostic work-up, medical treatment and community support (www.svedem.se). The patients are diagnosed and followed-up yearly in specialist units, primary care centres or in nursing homes. Results The database was initiated in May 2007 and covers almost all of Sweden. There were 28 722 patients registered with a mean age of 79.3 years during 2007–2012. Each participating unit obtains continuous online statistics from its own registrations and they can be compared with regional and national data. A report from SveDem is published yearly to inform medical and care professionals as well as political and administrative decision-makers about the current quality of diagnostics, treatment and care of patients with dementia disorders in Sweden. Conclusion SveDem provides knowledge about current dementia care in Sweden and serves as a framework for ensuring the quality of diagnostics, treatment and care across the country. It also reflects changes in quality dementia care over time. Data from SveDem can be used to further develop the national guidelines for dementia and to generate new research hypotheses."

In this study, we aimed to examine the role of autotoxicity in Sanqi replant failures and assess the role of ginsenosides in autotoxicity.The autotoxicities were measured using seedling emergence bioassays and root cell vigor staining. The ginsenosides in the roots, soils, and root exudates were identified with HPLC-MS.The seedling emergence and survival rate decreased significantly with the continuous number of planting years from one to three years. The root exudates, root extracts, and extracts from consecutively cultivated soils also showed significant autotoxicity against seedling emergence and growth. Ginsenosides, including R1, Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rb3, Rg2, and Rd, were identified in the roots and consecutively cultivated soil. The ginsenosides, Rg1, Re, Rg2, and Rd, were identified in the root exudates. Furthermore, the ginsenosides, R1, Rg1, Re, Rg2, and Rd, caused autotoxicity against seedling emergence and growth and root cell vigor at a concentration of 1.0 µg/mL.Our results demonstrated that autotoxicity results in replant failure of Sanqi ginseng. While Sanqi ginseng consecutively cultivated, some ginsenosides can accumulate in rhizosphere soils through root exudates or root decomposition, which impedes seedling emergence and growth."
https://openalex.org/W2064133695,"Isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) are the two most effective drugs in tuberculosis therapy. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of resistance to these two drugs is essential to quickly diagnose multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis. Nine clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant to only INH and RIF and 10 clinical pan-sensitive isolates were included to evaluate the expression of 20 putative drug efflux pump genes and sequence mutations in rpoB (RIF), katG (INH), the inhA promoter (INH), and oxyR-ahpC (INH). Nine and three MDR isolates were induced to overexpress efflux pump genes by INH and RIF, respectively. Eight and two efflux pump genes were induced to overexpress by INH and RIF in MDR isolates, respectively. drrA, drrB, efpA, jefA (Rv2459), mmr, Rv0849, Rv1634, and Rv1250 were overexpressed under INH or RIF stress. Most efflux pump genes were overexpressed under INH stress in a MDR isolates that carried the wild-type katG, inhA, and oxyR-ahpC associated with INH resistance than in those that carried mutations. The expression levels of 11 genes (efpA, Rv0849, Rv1250, P55 (Rv1410c), Rv1634, Rv2994, stp, Rv2459, pstB, drrA, and drrB) without drug inducement were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in nine MDR isolates than in 10 pan-sensitive isolates. In conclusion, efflux pumps may play an important role in INH acquired resistance in MDR M. tuberculosis, especially in those strains having no mutations in genes associated with INH resistance; basal expression levels of some efflux pump genes are higher in MDR isolates than in pan-sensitive isolates and the basal expressional differences may be helpful to diagnose and treat resistant tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2081674688,"Background: NADPH oxidase is a hydrogen peroxide-generating enzyme, involved in redox signaling in cancer. Results: NADPH oxidase-generated hydrogen peroxide increases DNA damage and genomic instability. Conclusion: NADPH oxidase-derived hydrogen peroxide mediates DNA damage in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Significance: The mechanism of DNA damage generation is important for studying aggressive AML phenotypes. Internal tandem duplication of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3-ITD) receptor is present in 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and it has been associated with an aggressive AML phenotype. FLT3-ITD expressing cell lines have been shown to generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). However, the molecular basis of how FLT3-ITD-driven ROS leads to the aggressive form of AML is not clearly understood. Our group has previously reported that inhibition of FLT3-ITD signaling results in post-translational down-regulation of p22phox, a small membrane-bound subunit of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. Here we demonstrated that 32D cells, a myeloblast-like cell line transfected with FLT3-ITD, have a higher protein level of p22phox and p22phox-interacting NOX isoforms than 32D cells transfected with the wild type FLT3 receptor (FLT3-WT). The inhibition of NOX proteins, p22phox, and NOX protein knockdowns caused a reduction in ROS, as measured with a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-specific dye, peroxy orange 1 (PO1), and nuclear H2O2, as measured with nuclear peroxy emerald 1 (NucPE1). These reductions in the level of H2O2 following the NOX knockdowns were accompanied by a decrease in the number of DNA DSBs. We showed that 32D cells that express FLT3-ITD have a higher level of both oxidized DNA and DNA DSBs than their wild type counterparts. We also observed that NOX4 and p22phox localize to the nuclear membrane in MV4–11 cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Taken together these data indicate that NOX and p22phox mediate the ROS production from FLT3-ITD that signal to the nucleus causing genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2023634476,"Background Approximately 800 women die of pregnancy-related complications every day. Over half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Most maternal deaths can be prevented with high quality maternal health services. It is well established that use of maternal health services vary by place of residence and socioeconomic status (SES), but few studies have examined the determinants of quality of maternal health services in SSA. The purpose of this study is to examine the determinants of antenatal care (ANC) quality in Ghana–focusing on the role of place of residence and SES (education and wealth). The analysis also examines the interactions of these variables and the mediating role of ANC timing, frequency, facility type, and provider type. Methods The data are from the Ghana Maternal Health Survey (N = 4,868). Analytic techniques include multilevel linear regression with mediation and moderation analysis. Results Urban residence and higher SES are positively associated with higher ANC quality, but the urban effect is completely explained by sociodemographic factors. Specifically, about half of the urban effect is explained by education and wealth alone, with other variables accounting for the remainder. The effects of education are conditional on wealth and are strongest for poor women. Starting ANC visits early and attending the recommended four visits as well as receiving ANC from a higher level facility and from a skilled provider are associated with higher quality ANC. These factors partially explain the SES differentials. Implications Ghanaian women experience significant disparities in quality of ANC, with poor illiterate women receiving the worst care. Targeted efforts to increase quality of ANC may significantly reduce maternal health disparities in Ghana and SSA. A particularly crucial step is to improve ANC quality in the lower level health facilities, where the most vulnerable women are more likely to seek ANC."
https://openalex.org/W2090822573,"Microglial cells are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), recognized as key elements in the regulation of neural homeostasis and the response to injury and repair. As excessive activation of microglia may lead to neurodegeneration, therapeutic strategies targeting its inhibition were shown to improve treatment of most neurodegenerative diseases. Benfotiamine is a synthetic vitamin B1 (thiamine) derivate exerting potentially anti-inflammatory effects. Despite the encouraging results regarding benfotiamine potential to alleviate diabetic microangiopathy, neuropathy and other oxidative stress-induced pathological conditions, its activities and cellular mechanisms during microglial activation have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects of benfotiamine were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine BV-2 microglia. We determined that benfotiamine remodels activated microglia to acquire the shape that is characteristic of non-stimulated BV-2 cells. In addition, benfotiamine significantly decreased production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NO; cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70), tumor necrosis factor alpha α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereas it increased anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in LPS stimulated BV-2 microglia. Moreover, benfotiamine suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and protein kinase B Akt/PKB. Treatment with specific inhibitors revealed that benfotiamine-mediated suppression of NO production was via JNK1/2 and Akt pathway, while the cytokine suppression includes ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and Akt pathways. Finally, the potentially protective effect is mediated by the suppression of translocation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) in the nucleus. Therefore, benfotiamine may have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting inflammatory mediators and enhancing anti-inflammatory factor production in activated microglia."

Understanding metabolic alterations associated with drug resistance opens up unexplored opportunities for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Here, we applied a broad spectrum of technologies including RNA sequencing, global untargeted metabolomics, and stable isotope labeling mass spectrometry to identify metabolic changes in P-glycoprotein overexpressing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells, which escaped a therapeutically relevant daunorubicin treatment. We show that compared with sensitive ALL cells, resistant leukemia cells possess a fundamentally rewired central metabolism characterized by reduced dependence on glutamine despite a lack of expression of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL), a higher demand for glucose and an altered rate of fatty acid β-oxidation, accompanied by a decreased pantothenic acid uptake capacity. We experimentally validate our findings by selectively targeting components of this metabolic switch, using approved drugs and starvation approaches followed by cell viability analyses in both the ALL cells and in an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) sensitive/resistant cell line pair. We demonstrate how comparative metabolomics and RNA expression profiling of drug-sensitive and -resistant cells expose targetable metabolic changes and potential resistance markers. Our results show that drug resistance is associated with significant metabolic costs in cancer cells, which could be exploited using new therapeutic strategies.

Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 829-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and cancer cell metabolism has therefore attracted interest as a target for therapeutic intervention (11.Carracedo A.

Cancer metabolism: current perspectives and future directions.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e248Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the development of drug resistance in cancer cells is accompanied by metabolic alterations that may be therapeutically targetable (14.Zhao Y. Butler E.B. Tan M. Targeting cellular metabolism to improve cancer therapeutics.Cell Death Dis. 2013; 4: e532Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). So far, only a few studies have analyzed the adaptations of cellular cancer metabolism in a resistance context. One of these studies showed metabolic rewiring to be essential in a lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cell line (15.Castro-Perez J.M. Roddy T.P. Shah V. McLaren D.G. Wang S.P. Jensen K. Vreeken R.J.

Another used computational analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic data on 59 cell lines from different types of cancer to identify a metabolic consensus phenotype associated with tumor cell chemosensitivity to platinum-based drugs (16.Araki Y.

However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors, merely identifying therapeutic opportunities is not sufficient; it is also necessary to develop methods for predicting which patients will benefit from specific therapeutic regimes. Transcriptional and metabolic changes associated with disease states can be detected using omics technologies, leading to the identification of combinations of prognostic markers such as oncometabolites and transcriptionally regulated metabolic networks. Such indicators could potentially be used to determine when it may be beneficial to treat a particular cancer patient with a drug or drug mixture that is normally used to manage other disease conditions. For example, they may indicate that it would be helpful to treat a patient with fibrates, which are used to reduce blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels (17.Oosterveer M.H.

Our combined approach of transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed a central metabolic switch that occurs in daunorubicin (DNR)-resistant P-gp overexpressing leukemia cells. Compared with DNR-sensitive cells, the resistant cells are more dependent on glucose but less dependent on glutamine and fatty acids. We demonstrate how knowledge gained from combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses can be exploited to develop new induction treatment strategies involving drugs approved for unrelated indications with relatively low toxicity, which at relevant concentrations, sensitize resistant leukemia cells to DNR treatment. CCRF-CEM [CCRF CEM] (ATCC® CCL-119TM) (CEM) and HL60 (ATCC® CCL-240TM) leukemia cells were acquired through LGC Standards (Teddington, UK) from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HL60/R10 cells were kindly provided by Professor Sigurd Vitols, Karolinska Institute. CEM cells were grown for 4 days in the presence of 0.1 μm DNR diluted from a saline stock solution (9.0 mm) provided by the Karolinska University Hospital Pharmacy (Stockholm, Sweden). The cells’ viability was then assessed by staining the dead cells with trypan blue and counting them with a TC10TM automated cell counter (Bio-Rad); fewer than 1% of the cells were found to be viable. After counting, the cells were washed twice with PBS, supplemented with fresh drug-free medium, and passaged 4 times, after which they were again incubated with 0.1 μm DNR, stained, and counted. The proportion of viable cells this time was >50%. These cells were again washed twice with PBS, transferred to fresh drug-free medium, passaged 4 times, and incubated, this time with 1 μm DNR. The above process of washing, passaging, and incubating with DNR was then repeated one last time, using a final DNR concentration of 5 μm to yield a CEM cell line with an IC50(DNR) of 1.67 μm that was designated CEM/R2 (Fig. 1, A and B). For all experiments, the cells were seeded in black plates with a final density of 15,000 cells/well in 100 μl. The relevant treatment was initiated immediately after the wells were seeded. ATPliteTM experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all experiments comparing cells growing in medium containing pantothenic acid versus pantothenic acid reduced medium (RPMI1640 on customer request, Life Technologies), 96 h prior to the actual experiment, the cells were seeded at 250,000 cells/ml in the appropriate medium. 48 h thereafter cells were passaged again in fresh respective medium. For the DNR dose-response curves (Figs. 1, B and C, and 5, H and I), the cells were incubated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of DNR in RPMI1640 with pantothenic acid (HyClone, Fisher Scientific) or without pantothenic acid (Life Technologies) containing 10% FBS (Sigma) or 10% charcoal:dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (CCS-FBS, Gemini Bio-Products). Cells were incubated for 48 h with or without the P-gp inhibitor valspodar (0.25 μm) in the absence (vehicle control dimethyl sulfoxide) or presence of DNR (CEM 1 nm, HL60 5 nm, CEM/R2 0.5 μm, HL60/R10 5 μm) (Fig. 1, E and F). The glutamine-free RPMI1640 (HyClone, Fisher Scientific) medium was supplemented with 10% FBS, and glutamine (Life Technologies) was added to final concentrations of 0.5, 1, or 2 mm. Cells were incubated for 72 h in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of glutamine (Fig. 2, B and C). To analyze the effect of glucose deprivation the cells were incubated in glucose-free RPMI1640 (Life Technologies) or glucose-containing RPMI1640 (HyClone, Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 2.5% FBS for 48 h, or HL60 and HL60/R10 cells for 72 h (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4.Resistant leukemia cells are more vulnerable to glucose deprivation and differentially affected by carnitine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor perhexiline.

They were then washed twice, incubated with a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200, in 1% BSA, ambient temperature for 30 min; Dako Diagnostics, Glostrup, Denmark), and washed twice again. FACS analysis was performed using a Guava easyCyte5 System (Millipore, Billerica, MA), with 10,000 events being counted for each sample. Two million cells were collected from each of the CEM and CEM/R2 lines. Total RNA was isolated and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Hilden, Germany). Samples of each line were prepared in triplicate for expression analysis by RNAseq. A detailed protocol for single cell RNAseq analysis has previously been reported (18.Islam S. Kjällquist U. Moliner A. Zajac P. Fan J.B. Lönnerberg P. Linnarsson S. Characterization of the single-cell transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-seq.Genome Res. 2011; 21: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 19.Islam S. Kjällquist U. Moliner A. Zajac P. Fan J.B. Lönnerberg P. Linnarsson S. Highly multiplexed and strand-specific single-cell RNA 5′ end sequencing.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 813-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and a very similar method was adopted in this work. Briefly, samples were prepared by adding 10 ng of RNA into each well of a 96-well PCR plate preloaded with lysis buffer. Reverse transcription reagents were added to generate first-strand cDNA. Well-specific barcodes were then introduced by exploiting a reverse transcriptase template-switching mechanism (20.Zajac P. Islam S. Hochgerner H. Lönnerberg P. Linnarsson S. Base preferences in non-templated nucleotide incorporation by MMLV-derived reverse transcriptases.PloS One. 2013; 8: e85270Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) whereby a helper oligonucleotide directs the incorporation of a specific sequence at the 3′ end of the cDNA molecule. A unique helper oligo containing a distinct 6-bp barcode and a universal primer sequence was added to each well, permitting amplification with a unique primer. All of the mRNA in a given well was thus tagged with a specific 6-bp barcode sequence. After cDNA synthesis, all of the reactions were pooled in a single tube and processed as a single sample. The pooled samples were purified and amplified by single-primer PCR in a single tube. This reduced the cell-to-cell amplification bias, minimizing the number of PCR cycles required. After PCR amplification, the samples were purified, processed, and adapted for Illumina sequencing. The cDNA library was fragmented, end-repaired, A-tailed, and the adapter ligated before making the final cDNA library for sequencing. Then the sample was diluted as necessary before being put in the Illumina sequencing machine. Single-end sequencing reads were generated from the final cDNA libraries. The sample was then loaded in single lanes to obtain a total of 150–200 million reads per 96-well library. Typically, 10–14 pmol of each sample was loaded onto the HiSeq 2000. Reads were sorted by barcode and mapped to the human genome using Bowtie (21.Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome.Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (14996) Google Scholar). Unmapped reads were discarded and the raw reads of each sample were normalized to transcripts per million. Raw counts for all samples were further normalized to remove non-biological differences caused by sequencing depth. Variance estimation was done using the “estimateDispersions” function that is built into DESeq (22.Anders S. Huber W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10310) Google Scholar). Statistical tests based on a negative binomial distribution (22.Anders S. Huber W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data.Genome Biol. 2010; 11: R106Crossref PubMed Scopus (10310) Google Scholar) were used to identify differentially expressed genes between two treatments. For experiments with 2H2O, 3 × 106 cells were cultured for 24 h in 1× RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS diluted with either sterile H2O or 2H2O (99%) to a final concentration of 30% 2H2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA). For untargeted metabolomics, 5 × 106 cells were grown for 4 h in 10 ml of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were centrifuged, washed at least once with PBS, transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, and lysed/extracted using 200 μl of 90:10 methanol:H2O to which a small lab-spoon of 0.2 μm inner diameter glass beads was added (Retsch). Tubes were placed in a Retsch Beadmill MM 400 and shaken at 30 Hz for 2 min. Eppendorf tubes were transferred to a microcentrifuge kept at 4 °C and spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min after which the supernatant was transferred to LC-MS glass vials, dried down in a speed vacuum concentrator, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 50:50 methanol:H2O, of which 2 to 4 μl were injected into an Agilent 1290 LC-system connected to either a 6540 or 6550 Agilent Q-TOF mass spectrometer. An electrospray ionization source was used in all of the LC-MS measurements. Data were collected between m/z 70 to 1700 in positive/negative ion mode. The following electrospray ionization settings were used (Agilent Jetstream); gas temperature 300 °C, gas flow 8 liters/min, nebulizer pressure 40 p.s.i., sheet gas temperature 350 °C, sheet gas flow 11, Vcap 4000, fragmentor 100, Skimmer1 45, and OctapoleRFPeak 750. All samples were separated using a reverse phase Kinetex C18 column, 100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm, 100 Å (Phenomenex, CA). Elution was performed using mixtures of solutions A (H2O, 0.1% formic acid) and B (75:25 acetonitrile:isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% formic acid); all solvents were of HPLC grade. All separations were performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using the following linear solvent gradient: min 0, 5% B; min 8, 95% B; min 10, 95% B; min 10.2, 5% B; min 12, 5% B. Raw data were processed using Mass Hunter Qual, Agilent with the “find by molecular feature” function; the resulting CEF files were further aligned and statistically processed in Mass Profiler Professional (Agilent). Metabolites were identified by comparing their accurate masses, retention times, and in some cases MS/MS spectra to data for synthetic standards obtained from Sigma and Inventia Pty. Ltd. (NSW, Australia). For pantothenic acid uptake and CoA biosynthesis measurements, 6 × 106 cells were grown for 24 h in 10 ml of RPMI1640 (HyClone, Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS with or without the addition of 0.25 mg/liter of stable isotope-labeled pantothenic acid (13C315N1) from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. The relative concentration of pantothenic acid was measured as described above. De novo synthesis and relative concentrations of CoA and acetyl-CoA were measured using an Agilent 1290 LC system connected to an Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Separation was performed using the reversed phase setup as described above. For quantitative estimation of CoA and acetyl-CoA the following multiple reaction monitoring transitions were used: CoA m/z 768–261 and acetyl-CoA m/z 810–303. To follow the incorporation of the 13C315N1-labeled pantothenic acid into CoA and acetyl-CoA the following multiple reaction monitoring transitions were used: 3C315N1-CoA m/z 772–265 and 3C315N1-acetyl-CoA m/z 814–307. For all transitions a dwell of 200 ms, fragmentor voltage of 135, and collision energy of 30 V were employed. The relative fraction of labeled to unlabeled CoA and acetyl-CoA was determined by analyzing the ratio of the integrated areas (labeled/unlabeled) for the respective multiple reaction monitoring transitions. This value reflects the rate of de novo formation of these metabolites. To investigate the molecular characteristics of leukemia cells escaping therapy-induced cell death, we applied a three-step selection approach to the ALL cell line CCRF-CEM (CEM) using increasing DNR concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 5 μm (Fig. 1A), to ultimately isolate cells designated CEM/R2 with an IC50(DNR) of 1.67 μm (Fig. 1B). This is a clinically relevant drug resistance level as DNR dosing during induction regimens is in the range of 60–80 mg/m2 for adult (>15 years) ALL patients (23.Stock W. Johnson J.L. Stone R.M.

Experimental validation confirmed an IC50(DNR) of 10.46 μm for the P-gp overexpressing HL60/R10 cells and 13.73 nm for HL60 cells (Fig. 1C). Transcriptional analyses of CEM and CEM/R2 cells using RNAseq revealed, among other things, that the P-gp gene ABCB1 is expressed in CEM/R2 but not in CEM cells (supplemental Table S1). Furthermore, FACS analyses revealed cell surface expression of P-gp in CEM/R2 but not CEM cells (Fig. 1D). Finally, both of the resistant cell lines, CEM/R2 and HL60/R10, were sensitized to DNR in the presence of the P-gp inhibitor valspodar but no such effect was observed for sensitive CEM and HL60 cells (Fig. 1, E and F). Transcriptional profiling of CEM and CEM/R2 cells using RNAseq revealed differential expression of 173 transcripts (supplemental Table S1). In addition to ABCB1, three genes displayed a reciprocal expression pattern between the CEM and CEM/R2 cells (supplemental Table S1). Transcripts encoding DENN/MADD domain-containing 2D protein (DENND2D), DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 15 (DNAJC15), and glutamate ammonia ligase (GLUL) were detected in CEM but not in CEM/R2 (supplemental Table S1). Examination of the RNAseq data further revealed that the canonical pathway exhibiting the most extensive differential expression between CEM/R2 and CEM cells was cholesterol biosynthesis; seven genes from this pathway (MSMO1, FDFT1, DHCR7, DHCR24, SQLE, IDI1, and HMGCS1) were up-regulated in CEM/R2 (supplemental Table S1). In addition to GLUL and the 7 genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, another 15 genes whose products are involved in metabolism were differentially expressed in CEM and CEM/R2 cells: GSTM3, PSAT1, MAT2B, DHFR, ASNS, ASS1, BCHE, IDH1, ALDOC, PCCB, MOCS2, ACAA2, PCBD2, SAT2, and SHMT2 (supplemental Table S1). Fig. 2A shows a cellular metabolic scheme featuring some of these genes, highlighting their functions and interconnections. GLUL is a gene encoding an enzyme that converts glutamate to glutamine. Its transcripts were detected in CEM but not in CEM/R2. This suggests that CEM/R2 lacks glutamine synthase activity and should therefore be more dependent on exogenous glutamine than the parent CEM line, in keeping with previous reports (26.Kung H.N.

Glutamine synthetase is a genetic determinant of cell type-specific glutamine independence in breast epithelia.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1002229Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The lack of glutamine synthase activity in CEM/R2 is further supported by the detected transcriptional down-regulation of PSAT1, ASNS, ASS1, and SLC1A5 (Fig. 2A), all of"

We prospectively investigated the association of low-carbohydrate diet score with type 2 diabetes risk. Methods Participants were 27,799 men and 36,875 women aged 45–75 years who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study and who had no history of diabetes. Dietary intake was ascertained by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire, and low-carbohydrate diet score was calculated from total carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake. The scores for high animal protein and fat or for high plant protein and fat were also calculated. Odds ratios of self-reported, physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5-year were estimated by using logistic regression. Results During the 5-year period, 1191 new cases of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. Low-carbohydrate diet score for high total protein and fat was significantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in women (P for trend <0.001); the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio of type 2 diabetes for the highest quintile of the score were 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.46–0.84), compared with those for the lowest quintile. Additional adjustment for dietary glycemic load attenuated the association (odds ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.45–1.25). When the score separated for animal and for plant protein and fat, the score for high animal protein and fat was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in women, whereas the score for high plant protein and fat was not associated in both men and women. Discussion Low-carbohydrate diet was associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese women and this association may be partly attributable to high intake of white rice. The association for animal-based and plant-based low-carbohydrate diet warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2036872044,"A fundamental challenge in the study of learning and memory is to understand the role of existing knowledge in the encoding and retrieval of new episodic information. The importance of prior knowledge in memory is demonstrated in the congruency effect—the robust finding wherein participants display better memory for items that are compatible, rather than incompatible, with their pre-existing semantic knowledge. Despite its robustness, the mechanism underlying this effect is not well understood. In four studies, we provide evidence that demonstrates the privileged explanatory power of the elaboration-integration account over alternative hypotheses. Furthermore, we question the implicit assumption that the congruency effect pertains to the truthfulness/sensibility of a subject-predicate proposition, and show that congruency is a function of semantic relatedness between item and context words."

We have examined whether they modulate proliferation and cytokine expression in asthmatic ASM cells by studying the effect of BET bromodomain mimics JQ1/SGCBD01 and I-BET762. ASM cells from healthy individuals and nonsevere and severe asthmatics were pretreated with JQ1/SGCBD01 and I-BET762 prior to stimulation with FCS and TGF-β. Proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation. IL-6 and CXCL8 release was measured by ELISA, and mRNA expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. ChIP using a specific anti-Brd4 antibody and PCR primers directed against the transcriptional start site of IL-6 and CXCL8 gene promoters was performed. Neither JQ1/SGCBD01 nor I-BET762 had any effect on ASM cell viability.

https://openalex.org/W2041370265,"Thousand cankers disease (TCD) of walnut trees (Juglans spp.) results from aggressive feeding in the phloem by the walnut twig beetle (WTB), Pityophthorus juglandis, accompanied by inoculation of its galleries with a pathogenic fungus, Geosmithia morbida. In 1960, WTB was only known from four U.S. counties (in Arizona, California, and New Mexico), but the species has now (2014) invaded over 115 counties, representing much of the western USA, and at least six states in the eastern USA. The eastern expansion places TCD in direct proximity to highly valuable (> $500 billion) native timber stands of eastern black walnut, Juglans nigra. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences, from nearly 1100 individuals, we examined variation among 77 samples of WTB populations across its extended range in the USA, revealing high levels of polymorphism and evidence of two divergent lineages. The highest level of genetic diversity for the different lineages was found in the neighboring Madrean Sky Island and Western New Mexico regions, respectively. Despite their proximity, there was little evidence of mixing between these regions, with only a single migrant detected among 179 beetles tested. Indeed, geographic overlap of the two lineages was only common in parts of Colorado and Utah. Just two haplotypes, from the same lineage, predominated over the vast majority of the recently expanded range. Tests for Wolbachia proved negative suggesting it plays no role in ""driving"" the spread of particular haplotypes, or in maintaining deep levels of intraspecific divergence in WTB. Genotyping of ribosomal RNA corroborated the mitochondrial lineages, but also revealed evidence of hybridization between them. Hybridization was particularly prevalent in the sympatric areas, also apparent in all invaded areas, but absent from the most haplotype-rich area of each mitochondrial lineage. Hypotheses about the specific status of WTB, its recent expansion, and potential evolutionary origins of TCD are discussed."

In this research, we explore whether sound symbolism may also facilitate synchronic language learning in human infants. Sound symbolism may be a useful cue particularly at the earliest developmental stages of word learning, because it potentially provides a way of bootstrapping word meaning from perceptual information. Using an associative word learning paradigm, we demonstrated that 14-month-old infants could detect Köhler-type (1947) shape-sound symbolism, and could use this sensitivity in their effort to establish a word-referent association."

A cranial window was prepared over the left frontal, parietal and temporal cortex in mice. Transient focal cerebral Ischemia was induced by directly ligating the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for two hours. Regional vascular response and cerebral blood flow (CBF) during ischemia and reperfusion were measured in real time. Early BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue (EB) and sodium fluorescein (Na-F) extravasation at 3 hours of reperfusion. Topical treatment with DL-propargylglycine (PAG, an inhibitor for cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)) and aspartate (ASP, inhibitor for cysteine aminotransferase/3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (CAT/3-MST)), but not O-(Carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride (CHH, an inhibitor for cystathionine β-synthase (CBS)), abolished postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and prevented EB and Na-F extravasation. CSE knockout (CSE-/-) reduced postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia but only inhibited Na-F extravasation. An upregulated CBS was found in cerebral cortex of CSE-/- mice. Topical treatment with CHH didn't further alter postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia, but prevented EB extravasation in CSE-/- mice. In addition, L-cysteine-induced hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production similarly increased in ischemic side cerebral cortex of control and CSE-/- mice. Our findings suggest that endogenous production of H2S by CSE and CAT/3-MST during reperfusion may be involved in postischemic cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia and play an important role in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia."

In vitro, molecular targeting to the HER2 receptor was the dominant factor driving cancer cell association. In contrast, size was found to be the key determinant of tumor accumulation in vivo, where molecular targeting increased tumor tissue concentrations for 30 nm but not 100 nm IONP. Similar to the in vitro results, PEGylation did not influence in vivo IONP biodistribution. Thus, the results reported here indicate that the in vitro advantages of molecular targeting may not consistently extend to pre-clinical in vivo settings. These observations may have important implications for the design and clinical translation of advanced, multifunctional, IONP platforms."

The regulation of mef/mel(msr) in these elements is not well understood. We identified the mef(E)/mel transcriptional start, localized the mef(E)/mel promoter, and demonstrated attenuation of transcription as a mechanism of regulation of macrolide-inducible mef-mediated macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae. The mef(E)/mel transcriptional start site was a guanine 327 bp upstream of mef(E). Consensus pneumococcal promoter -10 (5′-TATACT-3′) and -35 (5′-TTGAAC-3′) boxes separated by 17 bp were identified 7 bp upstream of the start site. Analysis of the predicted secondary structure of the 327 5’ region identified four pairs of inverted repeats R1-R8 predicted to fold into stem-loops, a small leader peptide [MTASMRLR, (Mef(E)L)] required for macrolide induction and a Rho-independent transcription terminator. RNA-seq analyses provided confirmation of transcriptional attenuation. In addition, expression of mef(E)L was also influenced by mef(E)L-dependent mRNA stability. The regulatory region 5’ of mef(E) was highly conserved in other mef/mel(msr)-containing elements including Tn1207.1 and the 5612IQ complex in pneumococci and Tn1207.3 in Group A streptococci, indicating a regulatory mechanism common to a wide variety of Gram-positive bacteria containing mef/mel(msr) elements."
https://openalex.org/W2025480171,"Chronic tinnitus, or “ringing of the ears”, affects upwards of 15% of the adult population. Identifying a cost-effective and objective measure of tinnitus is needed due to legal concerns and disability issues, as well as for facilitating the effort to assess neural biomarkers. We developed a modified gap-in-noise (GIN) paradigm to assess tinnitus in mice using the auditory brainstem response (ABR). We then compared the commonly used acoustic startle reflex gap-prepulse inhibition (gap-PPI) and the ABR GIN paradigm in young adult CBA/CaJ mice before and after administrating sodium salicylate (SS), which is known to reliably induce a 16 kHz tinnitus percept in rodents. Post-SS, gap-PPI was significantly reduced at 12 and 16 kHz, consistent with previous studies demonstrating a tinnitus-induced gap-PPI reduction in this frequency range. ABR audiograms indicated thresholds were significantly elevated post-SS, also consistent with previous studies. There was a significant increase in the peak 2 (P2) to peak 1 (P1) and peak 4 (P4) to P1 amplitude ratios in the mid-frequency range, along with decreased latency of P4 at higher intensities. For the ABR GIN, peak amplitudes of the response to the second noise burst were calculated as a percentage of the first noise burst response amplitudes to quantify neural gap processing. A significant decrease in this ratio (i.e. recovery) was seen only at 16 kHz for P1, indicating the presence of tinnitus near this frequency. Thus, this study demonstrates that GIN ABRs can be used as an efficient, non-invasive, and objective method of identifying the approximate pitch and presence of tinnitus in a mouse model. This technique has the potential for application in human subjects and also indicates significant, albeit different, deficits in temporal processing in peripheral and brainstem circuits following drug induced tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W2045258384,"Recent worldwide declines and extinctions of amphibian populations have been attributed to chytridiomycosis, a disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Until recently, Bd was thought to be the only Batrachochytrium species that infects amphibians; however a newly described species, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bs), is linked to die-offs in European fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra). Little is known about the distribution, host range, or origin of Bs. In this study, we surveyed populations of an aquatic salamander that is declining in the United States, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis), for the presence of Bs and Bd. Skin swabs were collected from a total of 91 individuals in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia, and tested for both pathogens using duplex qPCR. Bs was not detected in any samples, suggesting it was not present in these hellbender populations (0% prevalence, 95% confidence intervals of 0.0-0.04). Bd was found on 22 hellbenders (24% prevalence, 95% confidence intervals of 0.16 ≤ 0.24 ≤ 0.34), representing all four states. All positive samples had low loads of Bd zoospores (12.7 ± 4.9 S.E.M. genome equivalents) compared to other Bd susceptible species. More research is needed to determine the impact of Batrachochytrium infection on hellbender fitness and population viability. In particular, understanding how hellbenders limit Bd infection intensity in an aquatic environment may yield important insights for amphibian conservation. This study is among the first to evaluate the distribution of Bs in the United States, and is consistent with another, which failed to detect Bs in the U.S. Knowledge about the distribution, host-range, and origin of Bs may help control the spread of this pathogen, especially to regions of high salamander diversity, such as the eastern United States."

Faecal/stool samples were collected from 623 calves and 125 calf handlers in a cross-sectional survey. In two villages, water samples were collected monthly from water ponds and faecal/stool samples were collected monthly from inhabitants and their cattle. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in water samples and in faecal/stool samples and positive samples were genotyped, to determine their human or animal origin. The prevalence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in calves was 22% and 5% respectively. In calf handlers, the prevalence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium was 11.2% and 3.2% respectively. Both in the cross-sectional survey and in the longitudinal study in the villages, G. duodenalis assemblage E was most prevalent in calves, while in humans assemblage AII, BIII and BIV were found. In cattle, Cryptosporidium parvum, C. bovis and C. andersoni were identified, but no Cryptosporidium sequences were obtained from humans. Giardia and Cryptosporidium were detected in 14/24 and 12/24 water samples respectively. G. duodenalis assemblage E and BIV (-like), as well as C. andersoni and C. hominis were identified. Although the presence of Giardia and Cryptosporidium in both water ponds suggests that water-borne transmission of Giardia and Cryptosporidium is possible, the genotyping results indicate that there is no significant direct or indirect (water-borne) transmission of Giardia between cattle and people in this area of rural Bangladesh. No conclusions could be drawn for Cryptosporidium, because of the low number of sequences that were obtained from human and water samples."

However, how p15RS functions as an intrinsic repressor to repress transcription remains unclear. In this study, we show that p15RS, through a specific interaction with HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2), a deacetylase that regulates gene transcription, maintains histone H3 in a deacetylated state in the promoter region of Wnt-targeted genes where β-catenin·TCF4 is bound. We observed that histone deacetylase inhibitors impair the ability of p15RS in inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Depletion of HDAC2 markedly disabled p15RS inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. Interestingly, overexpression of p15RS decreases the level of acetylated histone H3 in the c-MYC promoter. Finally, we demonstrate that p15RS significantly enhances the association of HDAC2 and TCF4 and enhances the occupancy of HDAC2 to DNA, resulting in the deacetylation of histone H3 and the failure of β-catenin interaction. We propose that p15RS acts as an intrinsic transcriptional repressor for Wnt/β-catenin-mediated gene transcription at least partially through recruiting HDAC2 to occupy the promoter and maintaining deacetylated histone H3.

https://openalex.org/W1992088883,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Fufang or formula Xianlinggubao (XLGB) is a prescribed TCM drug in China registered for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Fufang in TCM is comprised of a group of herbal compounds contributing in group to the treatment efficacy. The present study aims to identify the bioactive fraction(s) in XLGB extract that account(s) dominantly for its osteogenic effects.The extract of XLGB formula was separated into three fractions using chromatography, i.e., XLGB-A, XLGB-B and XLGB-C. They were administrated to 4-month old ovariectomized (OVX) mice for 6 weeks to determine which bioactive fraction(s) were more effective for preventing OVX-induced bone loss evaluated by microCT, biomechanical testing and biochemical markers. The main peaks of the key fraction were identified using reference compounds isolated from the fraction. In addition, the effects of the composite compounds in XLGB-B on osteoblasts' proliferation and mineralization were evaluated in UMR 106 cells.XLGB-B with a yield of 13.0% from herbal Fufang XLGB was identified as the most potential one among the three fractions for prevention of OVX-induced bone loss confirmed with bone mass, bone microarchitecture, bone strength and bone turnover markers. Nine compounds in HPLC fingerprint were identified in the XLGB-B fraction, including phenylpropanoids from Herba Epimedii, terpenes from Radix Dipsaci and coumarins from Fructus Psoraleae. In addition, the identified compounds effectively promoted proliferation and/or mineralization of osteoblast-like UMR 106 cells in vitro.XLGB-B with defined phytochemical structures was screened as the key fraction that demonstrated preventive effects on OVX-induced bone loss in mice. The present study laid down a foundation towards a new generation of herbal Fufang characterized with ""less herbal materials for achieving equal treatment efficacy"" in development strategy of TCM for prevention of OVX-induced osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2142859095,"Thorough information about the relationship between physical activity (PA) and life satisfaction is still lacking. Therefore, this study examined the cross-sectional relationships between life satisfaction and meeting the World Health Organization (WHO) moderate to vigorous-intensity PA recommendations, total volume and duration of PA, intensity-specific PA (walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity), domain-specific PA (work, transport-related, domestic, and leisure-time), and 11 domain and intensity-specific PA types among university students. Additionally, we examined the associations between life satisfaction and gender, age, disposable income, community size, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), and self-rated health.The study included a random sample of 1750 university students in Zagreb, Croatia (response rate = 71.7%; 62.4% females; mean age 21.5 ± 1.8 years), using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long form and the Satisfaction with Life Scale.Higher life satisfaction was associated with female gender (β = 0.13; p = <0.001), younger age (β = -0.07; p = 0.024), higher disposable income (β = 0.10; p = 0.001), and better self-rated health (β = 0.30; p = <0.001). No significant association was found between life satisfaction and size of community (p = 0.567), smoking status (p = 0.056), alcohol consumption (p = 0.058), or BMI (p = 0.508). Among all PA variables, only leisure-time vigorous-intensity PA was significantly associated with life satisfaction after adjustments for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and self-rated general health (β = 0.06; p = 0.045).This study indicated a weak positive relationship between leisure-time vigorous-intensity PA and life satisfaction, whilst no such association was found for other PA variables. These findings underscore the importance of analyzing domain and intensity-specific PA levels in future studies among university students, as drawing conclusions about the relationship between PA and life satisfaction based on total PA levels only may be misleading."
https://openalex.org/W1992920643,"Found in neurons and neuroblastoma cells, Fas-induced apoptosis and accompanied activation of NF-κB signaling were thought to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the detailed functions of NF-κB activation in Fas killing and the effect of NF-κB activation on its downstream events remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that agonistic Fas antibody induces cell death in a dose-dependent way and NF-κB signaling is activated as well, in neuroblastoma cells SH-EP1. Unexpectedly, NF-κB activation was shown to be pro-apoptotic, as suggested by the reduction of Fas-induced cell death with either a dominant negative form of IκBα (DN-IκBα) or an IκB kinase-specific inhibitor. To our interest, when analyzing downstream events of NF-κB signaling, we found that DN-IκBα only suppressed the expression of caspase-4, but not other caspases. Vice versa, enhancement of NF-κB activity by p65 (RelA) overexpression increased the expression of caspase-4 at both mRNA and protein levels. More directly, results from dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated the regulation of caspase-4 promoter activity by NF-κB. When caspase-4 activity was blocked by its dominant negative (DN) form, Fas-induced cell death was substantially reduced. Consistently, the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 induced by Fas was also reduced. In contrast, the cleavage of caspase-8 remained unaffected in caspase-4 DN cells, although caspase-8 inhibitor could rescue Fas-induced cell death. Collectively, these data suggest that caspase-4 activity is required for Fas-induced cell apoptosis and caspase-4 may act upstream of PARP and caspase-3 and downstream of caspase-8. Overall, we demonstrate that NF-κB can mediate Fas-induced apoptosis through caspase-4 protease, indicating that caspase-4 is a new mediator of NF-κB pro-apoptotic pathway in neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059066937,"Activation of TLR7 and TLR9 by endogenous RNA- or DNA-containing ligands, respectively, is thought to contribute to the complicated pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These ligands induce the release of type-I interferons by plasmacytoid dendritic cells and autoreactive antibodies by B-cells, both responses being key events in perpetuating SLE. We recently described the development of inhibitory oligonucleotides (INH-ODN), which are characterized by a phosphorothioate backbone, a CC(T)XXX3–5GGG motif and a chemical modification of the G-quartet to avoid the formation of higher order structures via intermolecular G-tetrads. These INH-ODNs were equally or significantly more efficient to impair TLR7- and TLR9-stimulated murine B-cells, macrophages, conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells than the parent INH-ODN 2088, which lacks G-modification. Here, we evaluate the inhibitory/therapeutic potential of our set of G-modified INH-ODN on human immune cells. We report the novel finding that G-modified INH-ODNs efficiently inhibited the release of IFN-α by PBMC stimulated either with the TLR7-ligand oligoribonucleotide (ORN) 22075 or the TLR9-ligand CpG-ODN 2216. G-modification of INH-ODNs significantly improved inhibition of IL-6 release by PBMCs and purified human B-cells stimulated with the TLR7-ligand imiquimod or the TLR9-ligand CpG-ODN 2006. Furthermore, inhibition of B-cell activation analyzed by expression of activation markers and intracellular ATP content was significantly improved by G-modification. As observed with murine B-cells, high concentrations of INH-ODN 2088 but not of G-modified INH-ODNs stimulated IL-6 secretion by PBMCs in the absence of TLR-ligands thus limiting its blocking efficacy. In summary, G-modification of INH-ODNs improved their ability to impair TLR7- and TLR9-mediated signaling in those human immune cells which are considered as crucial in the pathophysiology of SLE."

Oxidant generation occurs within an intracellular phagosome, but diffusible species can react with the neutrophil and surrounding tissue. To investigate the extent of oxidative modification, we assessed the carbonylation of cytosolic proteins in phagocytic neutrophils.

Carbonylation was dependent on NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase activity and was inhibited by butylated hydroxytoluene and Trolox, indicating a role for myeloperoxidase-dependent lipid peroxidation. Proteomic analysis of target proteins revealed significant carbonylation of the S100A9 subunit of calprotectin, a truncated form of Hsp70, actin, and hemoglobin from contaminating erythrocytes.

The post-translational modification of neutrophil proteins will influence the functioning and fate of these immune cells in the period following phagocytic activation, and provides a marker of neutrophil activation during infection and inflammation. Neutrophils play a crucial role in inflammation through the phagocytosis and destruction of invading pathogens. Phagocytosis stimulates the assembly of the NOX2 NADPH oxidase complex in the phagosomal membrane, which reduces oxygen to superoxide (1.Babior B.M. NADPH oxidase: an update.Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The superoxide dismutates to hydrogen peroxide, which is a substrate for myeloperoxidase in the generation of microbicidal hypohalous acids (2.Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Inside the neutrophil phagosome: oxidants, myeloperoxidase, and bacterial killing.Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of oxidant generation to the phagosome helps limit potential damage to surrounding tissues, but adventitious release of myeloperoxidase and the diffusion of reactive species enable extraphagosomal oxidation. There have been relatively few investigations of extraphagosomal protein modification in activated neutrophils. It is known that chlorotyrosine generated by hypochlorous acid during phagocytosis is mostly on neutrophil rather than bacterial proteins (3.Chapman A.L. Hampton M.B. Senthilmohan R. Winterbourn C.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9757-9762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but many of these neutrophil proteins will be phagosomal. Neutrophils stimulated with a phorbol ester displayed protein carbonylation (4.Oliver C.N. Inactivation of enzymes and oxidative modification of proteins by stimulated neutrophils.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and oxidation of protein thiols (5.Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A.

The neutrophil proteins most susceptible to oxidative modification have not been identified. Carbonyl groups can be generated on proteins through metal-catalyzed oxidation of arginine, proline, and lysine residues, or by direct reaction with oxidants such as hypochlorous acid and chloramines (6.Requena J.R. Chao C.C. Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Glutamic and aminoadipic semialdehydes are the main carbonyl products of metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we quantified protein carbonylation in the cytosol isolated from phagocytic neutrophils and used proteomic techniques to identify those proteins most susceptible to modification. Carbonylation of neutrophil proteins was dependent on NOX2 and myeloperoxidase activity, and inhibitor studies and mass spectrometry analysis revealed a contribution for the products of lipid peroxidation. Cys-2 of S100A9 was shown to be particularly susceptible to modification by HNE in an isolated system. Such post-translational modifications might serve as a biomarker of neutrophil activation during infection or inflammation, and they are also likely to have significant functional implications for the activity of post-phagocytic neutrophils.

(ATCC 27127, New Zealand Communicable Disease Centre, Porirua) was cultured overnight in trypticase soy broth, harvested and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml glucose). Bacterial density was measured at 550 nm relative to a standard curve based on colony-forming units. Bacteria were opsonized with 10% autologous human serum at 37 °C immediately before addition to neutrophils. Human neutrophils were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood of healthy adult donors under sterile conditions by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis (9.Böyum A. Separation of leukocytes from blood and bone marrow. Introduction.Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 7PubMed Google Scholar). Human neutrophils (107/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% autologous serum for 10 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for up to 30 min with occasional mixing with opsonized S. aureus at ratios of 2, 10, 20, or 50 bacteria per neutrophil. At selected times, non-phagocytosed bacteria were removed by differential centrifugation at 100 × g (10.Hampton M.B. Vissers M.C. Winterbourn C.C. A single assay for measuring the rates of phagocytosis and bacterial killing by neutrophils.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the cell pellets were resuspended between 1–2 × 107 cells/ml in extract buffer (50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, in 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitor cocktail). The neutrophils were then lysed by nitrogen decompression at 375 p.s.i. for 20 min on ice using a Parr cell disruption vessel 4635 with 1831 nitrogen-filling connection (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL). The cell membrane, nuclear, and phagosomal fractions were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C followed by removal of neutrophil granules by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The remaining supernatant was the neutrophil cytosol. Protein concentrations of whole cell neutrophil lysates, 500 × g and 16,100 × g fractions, and cytosol were calculated using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Protein carbonyls and myeloperoxidase activity were measured by standard ELISA and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine oxidation assays as described previously (11.Buss H. Chan T.P. Sluis K.B.

The adducts were diluted into a 1:1 methanol/deionized H2O solution containing 1% (v/v) acetic acid, injected onto a Phenomenex Luna 5-μm C18 column, and measured by LC/MS using a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer coupled to a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC system (Thermo Finnigan). The HNE-GSH conjugate was eluted with 100% 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7, from 0 to 15 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The molecular ion (m/z 464) was fragmented using 27% collision energy and gave one major fragment ion (m/z 308). After removal of extracellular bacteria, neutrophils were lysed by resuspending them in 80% (v/v) chilled ethanol followed by sonication. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,100 × g, and the supernatant was taken to dryness under a vacuum. The isolated cytosols from unstimulated and phagocytic neutrophils were TCA-precipitated, resuspended at 2 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 5 mm biotin hydrazide, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. An equal volume of 30 mm sodium cyanoborohydride was added for 5 min followed by TCA precipitation, washed with a 1:1 ethanol/ethyl acetate solution diluted 1:4 with PBS, and resuspended in bead binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) at 2 mg/ml and added to streptavidin magnetic beads (5 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature with intermittent mixing. A magnet was used to collect the beads and washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Magnetic beads were then resuspended in 20 μl of deionized H2O, heated in a water bath to 70 °C, and held for 30 s. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature, and the beads were collected using a magnet to leave biotinylated carbonyl proteins in the supernatant. Neutrophil cytosolic extracts or supernatants containing biotinylated carbonyl proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes for Western blotting. Blots were probed with rabbit anti-HNE-Michael adduct antibody (1:2000) (Calbiochem), monoclonal mouse MRP14 (1:5000) (Abcam supplied by Sapphire Bioscience Pty. Ltd., Redfern, Australia), or streptavidin-conjugated FITC. Pooled biotinylated cytosolic carbonyl proteins were separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, using the methodology and equipment described previously (13.Baty J.W. Hampton M.B. Winterbourn C.C. Detection of oxidant sensitive thiol proteins by fluorescence labeling and two-dimensional electrophoresis.Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby, and the fluorescence was detected by a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager® FX at 488 nm. Protein spots were excised and underwent tryptic digest, reversed-phase zip tipping, and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Centre for Protein Research, Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago). Calprotectin was purified from the cytosol of human neutrophils obtained by nitrogen cavitation using a previously described method (14.Yousefi R. Imani M. Ardestani S.K. Saboury A.A. Gheibi N. Ranjbar B. Human calprotectin: effect of calcium and zinc on its secondary and tertiary structures, and role of pH in its thermal stability.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. (Shanghai). 2007; 39: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with Coomassie Blue staining of reducing SDS-PAGE gels indicating that the purity of calprotectin was 93% with the major contaminant, S100A12, making up 6%. For mass spectrometry and protein carbonyl experiments, calprotectin (40 μm) was incubated with HNE (0–800 μm) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. For tryptic digestion, samples were incubated with a 50:1 substrate:trypsin weight ratio at 37 °C for 16 h. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1% v/v final formic acid. N-Acetyl-TCK-IAM and N-acetyl-TCK-HNE were prepared by incubating N-acetyl-TCK in PBS with an excess of iodoacetamide (IAM) or HNE. The relative abundance of each peptide in tryptic digest experiments was standardized based on the sum peak area of peptides in that run that did not significantly change in abundance over all of the experiments (MSQLER, DLQNFLK, and QLSFEEFIMLMAR). Calprotectin samples analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS were diluted 1 in 5 with matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid dissolved in 65% (v/v) aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 10 mm ammonium dihydrogen phosphate), spotted onto a MALDI sample plate (Opti-TOF 384-well plate, AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA), and analyzed on a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (AB SCIEX). All MS spectra were acquired in linear, positive-ion mode with 1200 laser pulses per sample spot. The mass range between 1000 and 25,000 was calibrated on a five-peptide/protein calibration mix, and the mass range between 20,000 and 100,000 m/z was calibrated on the singly (66,000 m/z) and doubly charged (33,000 m/z) bovine serum albumin ions. For tryptic digest experiments, precursor ions of interest of each sample spot were selected for MS/MS collision-induced dissociation analysis. For intact protein experiments, S100A12 was used as an internal standard as it contains no cysteine residues (15.Ilg E.C. Troxler H. Bürgisser D.M. Kuster T. Markert M. Guignard F. Hunziker P. Birchler N. Heizmann C.W. Amino acid sequence determination of human S100A12 (P6, calgranulin C, CGRP, CAAF1) by tandem mass spectrometry.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Calprotectin samples analyzed by LC/ESI-MS were injected onto a Phenomenex Jupiter 4-μm Proteo 90A C18 column (150 × 2.0 mm) or a Thermo Hypercarb column (100 × 2.1 mm). Selected reaction monitoring was set up to monitor the most abundant daughter ion of each product after fragmentation. N-Acetyl-TCK-IAM was monitored by fragmenting 450.20 m/z and monitoring the 307.14 m/z fragment ion, and N-acetyl-TCK-HNE was monitored by fragmenting 549.30 m/z and monitoring the 393.18 m/z fragment ion. Standard curves were constructed for peak area response against the amount of peptide for N-acetyl-TCK-IAM and N-acetyl-TCK-HNE. The method was sensitive with a detection limit of 600 fmol for N-acetyl-TCK-IAM and 60 fmol for N-acetyl-TCK-HNE. Native N-acetyl-TCK was undetectable after treatment in independent experiments and, therefore, the assumption was made that all of the N-acetyl-TCK was modified in each case. IAM (4 mm final) was added to neutrophil cytosol (20 μg/100 μl), collected from S. aureus-stimulated and unstimulated neutrophils, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. S. aureus was cultured overnight in trypticase soy broth, diluted 1/50 into fresh broth, and cultured for a further 100 min. Exponential phase bacteria were then diluted 1/20 into Chelex-treated broth supplemented with 100 μm CaCl2, 5 μm FeSO4, and 1 mm MgCl2. Bacterial growth was monitored at A600 over 6 h in the presence or absence of calprotectin (100 μg/ml), or calprotectin pretreated with HNE. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Graphs and statistics were performed with the SigmaPlot software package (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) using repeated measures analysis of variance followed by the Holm-Šídák multiple comparison test. Differences were considered significant when the p value was < 0.05. Neutrophils were incubated with opsonized S. aureus with occasional mixing at 37 °C. Visual inspection confirmed extensive phagocytosis after 30 min, with all neutrophils containing intracellular bacteria (Fig. 1A). Nitrogen cavitation and differential centrifugation were used to separate the cytosol from phagosomes and granules. The cytosol contained 46% (S.D. 8%, n = 6) of the total protein of intact neutrophils and only trace amounts of myeloperoxidase activity, confirming successful removal of phagosomes and granules. Protein carbonyls were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and quantified by ELISA. The extent of carbonyl formation in the cytosol of phagocytic neutrophils was dependent on the ratio of bacteria to neutrophils, with carbonylation detectable at a 2:1 ratio and a steady increase as the number of bacteria increased (Fig. 1B). The phagocytosis-induced protein carbonyl formation was an early event, with maximum levels observed after only 15 min of co-incubation with S. aureus, and not increasing thereafter (Fig. 1C). Carbonyl formation was completely blocked in the cytosol of phagocytic neutrophils treated with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and the peroxidase inhibitor sodium azide (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that both a functional NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase are required to generate protein carbonyls in the cytosol of phagocytic neutrophils. Two myeloperoxidase-derived oxidants, hypochlorous acid and hypobromous acid, were unable to cause significant carbonylation when added to neutrophils (not shown), and only a very large concentration (100 μm) of dichloramine (NHCl2) was able to significantly increase carbonyl levels (0.643 nmol/mg versus 0.187 nmol/mg in the control samples). Therefore, when generated in the phagosome, it is most likely that these oxidants react with phagosomal protein rather than carbonylate cytosolic protein. An alternate mechanism of cytosolic protein carbonylation is via reactive aldehydes derived from lipid peroxidation (8.Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. Covalent attachment of 4-hydroxynonenal to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: a possible involvement of intra- and intermolecular cross-linking reaction.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6388-6393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was a dose-dependent inhibition of cytosolic protein carbonylation when phagocytosis occurred in the presence of the radical scavengers butylated hydroxytoluene and the water-soluble vitamin E analogue Trolox (Fig. 2, A and B), supporting a contribution by this mechanism. Glutathione ethyl ester is readily taken up by cells and is hydrolyzed by cytosolic esterases to yield GSH. Pretreatment of neutrophils with glutathione ethyl ester was able to partially reduce carbonyl formation in the cytosol of phagocytic neutrophils at concentrations of 50 μm or more, suggesting that thiol-reactive species were responsible for carbonylation (Fig. 2C). To determine whether reactive aldehydes could carbonylate neutrophil proteins, DPI-treated phagocytic neutrophil lysates were incubated with HNE. Extensive carbonylation was detected (Fig. 3). If the cytosolic extracts were first incubated with the thiol alkylator N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), there was almost complete inhibition of carbonyl formation at low doses of HNE. This indicates that carbonylation initially occurs on cysteine residues. At higher concentrations of HNE, inhibition by NEM was less effective, suggesting modification of other nucleophilic residues. To determine whether phagocytosis results in the generation of reactive aldehydes in the neutrophil cytosol, we monitored formation of HNE adducts with reduced GSH. An HNE-GSH standard monitored by positive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry gave a singly protonated ion at m/z 464 (Fig. 4A) and the major fragment ion m/z 308 (Fig. 4B). Trace amounts of the fragment ion were detectable in unstimulated neutrophils (Fig. 4C), and this increased dramatically in phagocytic neutrophils, indicating significant HNE production upon activation (Fig. 4E). Generation of the HNE-GSH adduct was inhibited by DPI and azide (Fig. 4, F and G). Carbonylated proteins were derivatized with biotin hydrazide and captured using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Significant protein capture was observed only from phagocytic neutrophils with an active NADPH oxidase, and this was lost in the absence of derivatization with biotin hydrazide (Fig. 5B). Comparison with starting material indicated that several of the major proteins were captured, but not all (Fig. 5A). Samples were transferred to PVDF membrane and probed with streptavidin-FITC (Fig. 5C), thereby revealing the proteins that had been directly biotinylated and not those captured through physical association with a biotinylated protein. The major carbonylated proteins also appeared to contain HNE adducts as assessed with an antibody that recognizes HNE-Michael adducts on proteins (Fig. 5D). The captured proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 6A), excised from the gel, and identified by mass spectrometry (Table 1). The major neutrophil proteins were identified as calprotectin, actin, and heat shock protein 70. Hemoglobin and apolipoprotein A1 were also captured, although they come from erythrocytes and serum present in the assay system. Calprotectin is a major neutrophil cytosolic protein that exists as heterodimer of S100A8 and S100A9 subunits that run at 8 and 14 kDa, respectively, by SDS-PAGE. These subunits correspond to the two major lower bands in Fig. 5, A and B, of which S100A9 was selectively carbonylated during phagocytosis. As confirmation of calprotectin modification, captured proteins were Western blotted with a monoclonal antibody specific to the S100A9 subunit of calprotectin. Although present in all of the starting extracts, carbonylated S100A9 was captured only in the cytosolic fractions of phagocytic neutrophils, except when DPI was present to inhibit the oxidative burst (Fig. 6B).TABLE 1Details of the cytosolic proteins captured by magnetic beads and identified by MALDI-TOF MSProteins identifiedSpotMM (2D)pI (2D)MM (Pred.)pI (Pred.)CoveragePeptide matchTotal ion scoreC.I.kDakDa%%Actin-3 subunit 2139.38.842.65.5414496Calprotectin S100A9 subunit227.75.713.25.7416386100Calprotectin S100A9 subunit313.65.713.25.71224599Calprotectin S100A9 subunit413.35.113.25.7537356100Calprotectin S100A9 subunit5135.413.25.7284222100Calprotectin S100A9 subunit65.94.913.25.717298100Calprotectin S100A8 subunit79.38.810.86.513261100Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1829.74.670.15.34196100Heat shock 70-kDa protein 1929.74.770.15.363159100Apolipoprotein A1 precursor1027.55.1285.33211601100Apolipoprotein A1 precursor1127.54.9285.33210324100Apolipoprotein A1 precursor12274.930.85.52811528100Hemoglobin β-subunit1313.28.8168222102100Streptavidin precursor1411.25.416.56.1263253100Streptavidin precursor1511.26.216.56.110171100 Open table in a new tab Purified calprotectin was treated with various concentrations of HNE, and protein carbonyls were measured by ELISA. Carbonyls were observed at 40 μm HNE and increased progressively with concentrations up to 800 μm (Fig. 7A). To determine the relative sensitivities of the subunits to modification, calprotectin was treated with HNE and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. S100A9 was most susceptible to modification by HNE with a significant decrease from the control observed with the lowest concentration of HNE (40 μm) (Fig. 7B). A truncated S100A9 subunit, missing the first four N-terminal residues (N-acetyl-TCKM), only showed a significant decrease from the control when HNE concentrations exceeded 200 μm, and the S100A8 subunit was the least susceptible. A new peak that was 156 molecular mass units higher (one HNE) than the S100A9 subunit was observed following treatment of calprotectin with equimolar HNE (not shown). To determine which residues were most susceptible to modification, calprotectin was treated with varying concentrations of HNE, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and LC/ESI-MS. Five peptides, T1, T3, T4, T13, and T14, had a loss of greater than 20% at calprotectin:HNE molar ratios of up to 1:20, whereas T2, T7, and T12 were unmodified (Fig. 7C). All modified peptides contained a cysteine, a histidine, or a lysine residue. Tryptic peptide T1 (N-acetyl-TCK), underwent the greatest loss at an equimolar calprotectin:HNE ratio. An HNE adduct was identified on N-acetyl-TCK by MS/MS analysis of the parent ion [M+H]+ with an m/z value of 549.18 yielding the loss of water and the characteristic loss of HNE (Fig. 7D). This adduct must be a HNE-cysteine Michael adduct as modification of the lysine residue would result in a missed cleavage and a merged product with peptide T2. HNE adducts were also identified on six histidine residues (Fig. 7E). These results confirm that S100A9 is the calprotectin subunit most susceptible to modification by HNE, and this susceptibility is due to the presence of a reactive cysteine residue near the N-terminal. N-Acetyl-TCK-HNE adducts were undetectable by LC/ESI-MS selective reaction monitoring in the cytosols prepared from phagocytic neutrophils.

https://openalex.org/W2006481798,"Borrelia turcica comprises the third major group of arthropod-transmitted borreliae and is phylogenetically divergent from other Borrelia groups. The novel group of Borrelia was initially isolated from Hyalomma aegyptium ticks in Turkey and it was recently found in blood and multiple organs of tortoises exported from Jordan to Japan. However, the ecology of these spirochetes and their development in ticks or the vertebrate hosts were not investigated in detail; our aims were to isolate the pathogen and to evaluate the possibility of transstadial transmission of Borrelia turcica by H. aegyptium ticks. Ticks were collected from Testudo graeca tortoises during the summer of 2013 from southeastern Romania. Engorged nymphs were successfully molted to the adult stage. Alive B. turcica was isolated from molted ticks by using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) II medium. Four pure cultures of spirochetes were obtained and analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Sequence analysis of glpQ, gyrB and flaB revealed 98%-100% similarities with B. turcica. H. aegyptium ticks collected from T. graeca tortoises were able to pass the infection with B. turcica via transstadial route, suggesting its vectorial capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2071084003,"The divergent TGF-β superfamily member, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15), is overexpressed by most cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Whilst its circulating levels are linked to cancer outcome, the role MIC-1/GDF15 plays in cancer development and progression is incompletely understood. To investigate its effect on PCa development and spread, we have used TRAMP prostate cancer prone mice bearing a germline deletion of MIC-1/GDF15 (TRAMPMIC-/-). On average TRAMPMIC-/- mice died about 5 weeks earlier and had larger prostatic tumors compared with TRAMP mice that were wild type for MIC-1/GDF15 (TRAMPMIC+/+). Additionally, at the time of death or ethical end point, even when adjusted for lifespan, there were no significant differences in the number of mice with metastases between the TRAMPMIC+/+ and TRAMPMIC-/- groups. However, consistent with our previous data, more than twice as many TRAMP mice overexpressing MIC-1/GDF15 (TRAMPfmsmic-1) had metastases than TRAMPMIC+/+ mice (p<0.0001). We conclude that germ line gene deletion of MIC-1/GDF15 leads to increased local tumor growth resulting in decreased survival consistent with an overall protective role for MIC-1/GDF15 in early primary tumor development. However, in advancing disease, as we have previously noted, MIC-1/GDF15 overexpression may promote local invasion and metastatic spread."
https://openalex.org/W1991185225,"The term “bilateral deficit” (BLD) has been used to describe a reduction in performance during bilateral contractions when compared to the sum of identical unilateral contractions. In old age, maximal isometric force production (MIF) decreases and BLD increases indicating the need for training interventions to mitigate this impact in seniors. In a cross-sectional approach, we examined age-related differences in MIF and BLD in young (age: 20–30 years) and old adults (age: >65 years). In addition, a randomized-controlled trial was conducted to investigate training-specific effects of resistance vs. balance training on MIF and BLD of the leg extensors in old adults. Subjects were randomly assigned to resistance training (n = 19), balance training (n = 14), or a control group (n = 20). Bilateral heavy-resistance training for the lower extremities was performed for 13 weeks (3 × / week) at 80% of the one repetition maximum. Balance training was conducted using predominately unilateral exercises on wobble boards, soft mats, and uneven surfaces for the same duration. Pre- and post-tests included uni- and bilateral measurements of maximal isometric leg extension force. At baseline, young subjects outperformed older adults in uni- and bilateral MIF (all p < .001; d = 2.61–3.37) and in measures of BLD (p < .001; d = 2.04). We also found significant increases in uni- and bilateral MIF after resistance training (all p < .001, d = 1.8-5.7) and balance training (all p < .05, d = 1.3-3.2). In addition, BLD decreased following resistance (p < .001, d = 3.4) and balance training (p < .001, d = 2.6). It can be concluded that both training regimens resulted in increased MIF and decreased BLD of the leg extensors (HRT-group more than BAL-group), almost reaching the levels of young adults."

The causes and control measures of woody plant encroachment are of common interest, especially where it negatively affects the objectives of an agricultural enterprise. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of gut passage (goats, cattle), dung (nutrients), fire, grass competition and trampling on establishment of A. nilotica and D. cinerea seedlings. Germination trials were subjected to the following treatments: 1) seed passage through the gut of cattle and goats and unpassed/ untreated seeds (i.e. not ingested), 2) dung and control (no dung), 3) grass and control (mowed grass), 4) fire and control (no fire), 5) trampling and control (no trampling). The interaction of animal species, grass and fire had an effect on seedling recruitment (P < 0.0052). Seeds retrieved from goats and planted with no grass and with fire (6.81% ± 0.33) had a significant effect on seedling recruitment than seeds retrieved from goats and planted with grass and no fire (2.98% ± 0.33). Significantly more D. cinerea and A. nilotica seeds germinated following seed ingestion by goats (3.59% ± 0.16) than cattle (1.93% ± 0.09) and control or untreated seeds (1.69% ± 0.11). Less dense grass cover, which resulted in reduced grass competition with tree seedlings for light, space and water, and improved seed scarification due to gut passage were vital for emergence and recruitment of Acacia seedlings. These results will contribute considerably to the understanding of the recruitment phase of woody plant encroachment."
https://openalex.org/W2080360147,"Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension and physical inactivity, are common in Australia, but the prevalence varies according to cultural background. We examined the relationship between region of birth, measures of acculturation, and CVD risk profiles in immigrant, compared to Australian-born, older Australians. Cross-sectional data from 263,356 participants aged 45 and over joining the population-based 45 and Up Study cohort from 2006–2008 were used. Prevalence ratios for CVD risk factors in Australian- versus overseas-born participants were calculated using modified Poisson regression, adjusting for age, sex and socioeconomic factors and focusing on Asian migrants. The association between time resident in Australia and age at migration and CVD risk factors in Asian migrants was also examined. Migrants from Northeast (n = 3,213) and Southeast Asia (n = 3,942) had lower levels of overweight/obesity, physical activity and female smoking than Australian-born participants (n = 199,356), although differences in prevalence of overweight/obesity were sensitive to body-mass-index cut-offs used. Compared to Australian-born participants, migrants from Northeast Asia were 20–30% less likely, and from Southeast Asia 10–20% more likely, to report being treated for hypertension and/or hypercholesterolaemia; Southeast Asian migrants were 40–60% more likely to report diabetes. Northeast Asian-born individuals were less likely than Australian-born to have 3 or more CVD risk factors. Diabetes, treated hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia occurred at relatively low average body-mass-index in Southeast Asian migrants. The CVD risk factor profiles of migrants tended to approximate those of Australian-born with increasing acculturation, in both favourable (e.g., increased physical activity) and unfavourable directions (e.g., increased female smoking). Minimizing CVD risk in migrant populations may be achieved through efforts to retain the healthy facets of the traditional lifestyle, such as a normal body mass index and low prevalence of smoking in women, in addition to adopting healthy aspects of the host country lifestyle, such as increased physical activity."

Plin1 defect leads to low adiposity in mice and partial lipodystrophy in human. This study investigated the roles of Plin1 in adipocyte differentiation. Plin1 null (-/-) mice showed plenty of multilocular adipocytes and small unilocular adipocytes in adipose tissue, along with lack of a subpopulation of adipose progenitor cells capable of in vivo adipogenesis and along with downregulation of adipogenic pathway. Before initiation of differentiation, adipose stromal-vascular cells (SVCs) from Plin1-/- mice already accumulated numerous tiny lipid droplets, which increased in number and size during the first 12-h induction but thereafter became disappeared at day 1 of differentiation. The adipogenic signaling was dysregulated despite protein level of PPARγ was near normal in Plin1-/- SVCs like in Plin1-/- adipose tissue. Heterozygous Plin1+/- SVCs were able to develop lipid droplets, with both the number and size more than in Plin1-/- SVCs but less than in Plin1+/+ SVCs, indicating that Plin1 haploinsufficiency accounts for attenuated adipogenesis. Aberrant lipid droplet growth and differentiation of Plin1-/- SVCs were rescued by adenoviral Plin1 expression and were ameliorated by enhanced or prolonged adipogenic stimulation. Our finding suggests that Plin1 plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation and provides an insight into the pathology of partial lipodystrophy in patients with Plin1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2000754726,"The ethanol extract of Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) root has promising anti-cancer and other bioactivities in rodent models. It is currently believed that the pyranocoumarin isomers decursin (D) and decursinol angelate (DA) contribute to these activities. We and others have documented that D and DA were rapidly converted to decursinol (DOH) in rodents. However, our in vitro metabolism studies suggested that D and DA might be metabolized differently in humans. To test this hypothesis and address a key question for human translatability of animal model studies of D and DA or AGN extract, we conducted a single oral dose human pharmacokinetic study of D and DA delivered through an AGN-based dietary supplement Cogni.Q (purchased from Quality of Life Labs, Purchase, NY) in twenty healthy subjects, i.e., 10 men and 10 women, each consuming 119 mg D and 77 mg DA from 4 vegicaps. Analyses of plasma samples using UHPLC-MS/MS showed mean time to peak concentration (Tmax) of 2.1, 2.4 and 3.3 h and mean peak concentration (Cmax) of 5.3, 48.1 and 2,480 nmol/L for D, DA and DOH, respectively. The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) for D and DA was similar (17.4 and 19.3 h) and each was much longer than that of DOH (7.4 h). The mean area under the curve (AUC0-48h) for D, DA and DOH was estimated as 37, 335 and 27,579 h∙nmol/L, respectively. Gender-wise, men absorbed the parent compounds faster and took shorter time to reach DOH peak concentration. The human data supported an extensive conversion of D and DA to DOH, even though they metabolized DA slightly slower than rodents. Therefore, the data generated in rodent models concerning anti-cancer efficacy, safety, tissue distribution and pharmacodynamic biomarkers will likely be relevant for human translation.

We have studied the role of abscisic acid (ABA) during the development of young tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) seedlings. We observed that ABA deficiency caused a reduction in hypocotyl growth at the level of cell elongation and that the growth in ABA-deficient plants could be improved by treatment with exogenous ABA, through which the plants show a concentration dependent response. In addition, ABA accumulated in dark-grown tomato seedlings that grew rapidly, whereas seedlings grown under blue light exhibited low growth rates and accumulated less ABA. We demonstrated that ABA promotes DNA endoreduplication by enhancing the expression of the genes encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases SlKRP1 and SlKRP3 and by reducing cytokinin levels. These data were supported by the expression analysis of the genes which encode enzymes involved in ABA and CK metabolism. Our results show that ABA is essential for the process of hypocotyl elongation and that appropriate control of the endogenous level of ABA is required in order to drive the growth of etiolated seedlings."

Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of nosocomial pneumonia, surgical site infections, and blood stream infections. The bacterium remains a severe threat to human health, in part due to the continued emergence of strains that are resistant to existing antibiotics (1.Baron S. Medical Microbiology.in: 4th Ed. University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX1996Google Scholar). To survive, S. aureus relies heavily on virulence and adaptability to its environment. The S. aureus cell envelope structure is highly complex, and this complexity is central to the survival and adaptability of the organism. Major components of the cell envelope are glycosylated structures (2.Schäffer C. Messner P.

The role of WTAs in these processes is complex and not well understood at the molecular level. WTAs serve to protect the cell from degradation through lysozyme (8.Bera A. Biswas R. Herbert S.

Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67: 313-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and this variability represents one strategy that allows these organisms to adapt to the environment or react to host defense systems (3.Weidenmaier C.

Most of the S. aureus strains produce poly-ribitol-phosphate (RboP)-type WTA, which is composed of ∼40 RboP units that are connected by 1,5-phosphodiester bonds. Some of the C4 hydroxyl groups of the WTA RboP unit are either substituted with α-O- or β-O-GlcNAc, whereas the C2 hydroxyls sometimes carry a d-alanine (Fig. 1). Biosynthesis of WTA in S. aureus is carried out by a cluster of enzymes belonging to the teichoic acid ribitol (Tar) synthesizing pathway, many of which have only been recently characterized. The polyribitol backbone is covalently attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid moiety of the peptidoglycan via a disaccharide (ManNAc→β(1,4)-GlcNAc-1-P) linkage unit followed by two units of glycerol phosphates (14.Kojima N. Araki Y. Ito E. Structure of the linkage units between ribitol teichoic acids and peptidoglycan.J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 299-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1. In concert with TarA, TarB, TarI, TarJ, and TarL, the main chain is synthesized on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl monophosphate (C55P), which is embedded in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. After the completion of glycosylation, the main chain of WTA is flipped to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane via the ABC-type transporter TarG/TarH (13.Brown S. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Walker S.

The evolvement of host-pathogen interaction is thought to have led to the increase of positive charges in the bacterial cell wall to circumvent the action of cationic antimicrobial peptides (17.Peschel A.

The β-GlcNAcylation of RboP is critical for the resistance of S. aureus (MRSA) to β-lactams (6.Brown S. Xia G. Luhachack L.G. Campbell J. Meredith T.C. Chen C. Winstel V. Gekeler C. Irazoqui J.E.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 18909-18914Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore β-GlcNAc residues on WTA are recognized by the mannose-binding lectin, leading to complement activation pathway of the human innate immune system as well as by antibodies in the adaptive immune system (20.Kurokawa K. Jung D.J. An J.H. Fuchs K. Jeon Y.J. Kim N.H. Li X. Tateishi K. Park J.A. Xia G. Matsushita M. Takahashi K. Park H.J. Peschel A. Lee B.L.

Chem. 2013; 288: 30956-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The role of the α-GlcNAcylation is not yet known. To define the mechanism of RboP glycosylation, we have performed a structure-function analysis of the glycosyltransferase TarM, a 171-kDa protein. Sequence analysis and database research predicted one domain of TarM to belong to the GT-B superfamily of glycosyltransferases (21.Breton C. Fournel-Gigleux S. Palcic M.M. Recent structures, evolution and mechanisms of glycosyltransferases.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), whereas the second domain was assigned DUF1975 (domain of unknown function) according to the Pfam database (22.Finn R.D. Bateman A. Clements J. Coggill P. Eberhardt R.Y. Eddy S.R. Heger A. Hetherington K. Holm L. Mistry J. Sonnhammer E.L. Tate J. Punta M. Pfam: the protein families database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D222-D230Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TarM reveals a propeller-like trimer, with the three GT-B domains arranged as blades around a central hub formed by the three DUF1975 domains. Accordingly, we suggest the name HUB for DUF1975. The structure analysis of TarM bound to its substrate UDP-GlcNAc identifies the active site, defines essential contacts with this ligand, and suggests a plausible reaction mechanism. As TarM is the first known enzyme structure in the biogenesis pathway of poly-RboP WTA, our work sheds light on an essential aspect of S. aureus glycosylation and provides an initial framework for investigating parameters that dictate glycosylation of WTAs in bacteria. S. aureus strains were cultured in BM media (1% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) glucose, 0.1% (w/v) K2HPO4, pH 7.2). Escherichia coli strains were cultivated in LB media (1% (w/v) casein hydrolysate peptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, 1% (w/v) glucose, 1‰ (w/v) K2HPO4, pH 7.2). Wild-type tarM (SACOL 1043) was subcloned as reported previously (19.Xia G. Maier L. Sanchez-Carballo P. Li M. Otto M. Holst O. Peschel A. Glycosylation of wall teichoic acid in Staphylococcus aureus by TarM.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13405-13415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). QuikChange (Stratagene) was used to introduce point mutations into the glycosyltransferase active site in either pRB474-tarM or pBAD-TOPO-102/202-tarM (EcoRI/BamHI, Amp or Kan) as template. pRB474 shuttle vectors containing tarM variants (wt or mutant) were transformed into S. aureus RN4220 mutant ΔtarMΔtarS for determining the efficiency of plaquing (EOP). Thus tarM and tarM mutants were fused to a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus and subcloned into the pBAD vector for recombinant expression in E. coli strain Top10 (Table 1).TABLE 1Design of TarM mutationsMutationLocationRationaleH249AGt-NRemoves contact with M18, possible indirect impact on catalytic activityR326SGt-CRemoves contact with UDP-GlcNAc phosphateK331SGt-CRemoves contact with UDP-GlcNAc phosphate, removes possible contact with Glu-403E403AGt-CRemoves carboxylic function, removes possible catalytic activityE411AGt-CRemoves interaction with UDP riboseK136SHUBDisrupts intra-HUB contacts, possible other functionN138QHUBDisrupts intra-HUB contactsN180WHUBDisrupts intra-HUB contactsV159Y/C164RHUBDisrupts intra-HUB contacts, possible other functionK136S/V159Y/C164RHUBDisrupts intra-HUB contacts, possible other function Open table in a new tab Single colonies of E. coli transformants containing tarM variants were grown on antibiotics containing LB agar (1.5% (w/v) agar-agar in LB-medium). They were inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium and grown overnight at 37 °C. For large scale protein production, bacterial culture was induced at the log phase (A600 ≈ 0.5–1.0) with l-arabinose at a final concentration of 0.001% (w/v) at 20 °C for 12–20 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 7,900 × g for 13 min. After washing once with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), the cells were resuspended with buffer B (100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 500 mm LiCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) for storage at −80 °C or for purification as described below. Cells were lysed by ultrasonication (Digital Sonifer, Branson). After centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 55 min, the supernatant containing recombinant TarM was collected and used as the crude TarM preparation after dialyzing against buffer C (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 500 mm LiCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT). The crude preparation was applied onto a His-Trap-FF nickel-chelate affinity column (GE Healthcare, 5 ml), and the column was subsequently washed with 30 column volumes of buffer C followed by another washing step with 10 column volumes of buffer C containing 10 mm imidazole. Pure TarM was eluted using a gradient ranging from 36 to 400 mm imidazole in buffer C. The pure sample was then concentrated to 1 mg/ml (Sartorius vivaspin20 PES, 50.000 molecular weight cutoff), dialyzed against buffer D (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5, 250 mm LiCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and subjected to 2 successive treatments with enterokinase (Ekmax, 20 °C, 15–20 h, 1.5 units/mg; Life Technologies). Aggregated proteins and excess enterokinase were removed by gel filtration (Superdex200). A final concentration step yielded highly monodisperse pure protein that was then used for crystallization and biophysical characterization. Purity and homogeneity of TarM were assessed by SDS-PAGE as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS). Initial small crystals grew as trapezoid-shaped plates (diameter ≈ 50 μm) in 600-nl drops containing 300 nl of TarM protein solution in buffer D and 300 nl of crystallizing buffer E (100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 200 mm Ca(OAc)2, 20%(w/v) PEG-1000) in 96-well plates using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Refinement yielded the final crystallization condition (100 mm imidazole, pH 7.7–8.2, 18–21% (w/v) PEG-1000, 0.1–0.25 m Ca(OAc)2) which produced large, single crystals (diameter ≈ 250 μm). After soaking crystals in cryoprotection solution (buffer D:buffer E = 1:1, 10% (v/v) (4s)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) they were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on a PILATUS 2 m hybrid pixel detector using synchrotron beam line X06DA at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) super-bending magnet (2.9 tesla), and they were processed with the XDS package (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11214) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to spacegroup P6322 with cell parameters of a = b = 123.7 Å and c = 223.3 Å (Table 2). They contain one TarM monomer in their asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 74%. For the determination of phases, crystals were soaked in crystallization condition containing the anomalous scatterer iodide (buffer D:buffer E = 1:1, 400 mm KI). After soaking them for 30 min, the crystals were back-soaked in cryoprotection solution and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The autoSHARP routine protocol (24.Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G.

The final model includes residues 1–493 (PDB ID 4WAC). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 2.TABLE 2Data and refinement statistics Open table in a new tab To solve the structure of the ligand-bound complex, purified TarM was preincubated with UDP-GlcNAc (15 mm, buffer D, 1 h, 4 °C) and then subjected to high throughput crystallization screening using a robot. Diffracting crystals were obtained with crystallization solution buffer F (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) PEG-8000). Although slightly smaller than the crystals obtained with unliganded TarM, the complex crystals shared a similar morphology. The crystals were soaked in the new crystallization condition containing a higher amount of cocrystallant (buffer D:buffer F = 1:1, 50 mm UDP-GlcNAc) and subsequently transferred to cryoprotectant-containing solution (buffer D: buffer F = 1:1, 50 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 10%(v/v) (4s)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) before freezing them in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on a PILATUS 2 m detector at beamline X06DA of the Swiss Light Source. Data processing using XDS (23.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 2. Figures were generated with PyMOL (34.DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.in: Schrodinger, LLC, New York2010Google Scholar). DLS measurements were performed on a Nano Zetasizer (Malvern) with purified TarM samples at 1 mg/ml in buffer D or buffer G (10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.01 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaF). Data were recorded and evaluated using Zeta Software (Malvern). CD measurements were performed on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter with purified TarM samples at ∼0.5 mg/ml in buffer G. A path length of 0.1 cm was used, and the samples were scanned at a speed of 50 nm/min. Data were recorded and evaluated using the software Spectra Manager (Jasco). To analyze the in vivo activity of TarM and its variants, the plaquing efficiency of bacteriophage φ11 was determined by plating φ11 on S. aureus mutant strain RN4220ΔtarMΔtarS complemented with empty plasmid (pRB474), a plasmid encoding wt TarM (pRB474-tarM), or plasmids encoding TarM variants (see Table 1). To determine the plaquing efficiency, 100 μl of φ11 lysate with ∼1000 plaque-forming units (pfu) was mixed well with 100 μl of bacteria culture containing ∼4 × 107 colony forming units. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, the infection mixture was mixed well with 5 ml of soft agar and then poured onto BM plates containing 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The plates stood at 37 °C overnight (16–24 h) and following up, the pfu was enumerated. The plaquing efficiency of φ11 on tarM-complemented RN4220ΔtarMΔtarS was set to 100%. The colorimetric assay was prepared according to Mulder's procedure (35.Mulder G.J. van Doorn A.B. A rapid NAD+-linked assay for microsomal uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase of rat liver and some observations on substrate specificity of the enzyme.Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 1.5 μg of recombinant TarM variants (in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2) were incubated with UDP-GlcNAc (2 mm) and non-glycosylated WTA (25 μm) that was isolated from RN4220 ΔtarMΔtarS (36.Winstel V. Sanchez-Carballo P. Holst O. Xia G. Peschel A. Biosynthesis of the unique wall teichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus lineage ST395.mBio. 2014; 5: e00869Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and a reaction mixture consisting of phosphoenolpyruvate and NADH (0.2 mm each). The release of UDP by TarM was assayed through the coupled conversion of NADH to NAD+ (340 nm, 40 min, 25 °C) by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (2 units each), leading to the decrease of absorbance. TarM assembles into a symmetric, propeller-like homotrimer, with three blades projecting from the central hub (Fig. 2, A and B). The three blades project at angles of ∼120 degrees from the hub (Fig. 2A), giving the propeller a cradle-like appearance, with a large cavity at its center. Each TarM monomer can be divided into two regions (Fig. 2, C and D); the glycosyltransferase (GT) domain forms the blade, which can be further subdivided into an N-terminal domain (Gt-N; residues 1–80, 202–309) and a C-terminal domain (Gt-C; residues 310–493). The trimer is assembled by three copies of a domain (residues 81–201) that was originally annotated as a domain of unknown function (DUF1975) and that is inserted into Gt-N. This domain features a 10-stranded antiparallel β-sheet composed of strands β4 through β13, with one face of the sheet covered by a single α-helix (α4). Given its function in TarM trimerization, we refer to this domain as the HUB domain. The Gt-N and HUB domains are well ordered and exhibit low overall temperature factors (B-factors). In contrast, large portions of Gt-C display higher mobility and elevated B-factors, probably as a result of the larger surface-exposed area of this domain, the paucity of its interactions in the crystal lattice, and its flexible linkage to Gt-N. The Gt-N domain is positioned atop the HUB, whereas Gt-C projects away from this assembly at an angle of ∼40 degrees. Each TarM monomer, therefore, has a bent, hook-like conformation, givi"

https://openalex.org/W2010302153,"We analyzed the relationship between performance on the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older subjects. Our secondary aim was to determine the distance to be completed on the 6MWT for the subject to achieve a score of 50 on the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). Associations were tested using linear correlation and multivariate linear regression. Participants were 130 healthy older individuals. The predictive performance of the 6MWT based on an SF-36 score of 50 was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic curve and its area under curve (AUC). Associations were observed between physical functioning, role-emotional, social functioning, vitality, general health score, and 6MWT performance in women, after adjusting for confounding variables (coefficients: 0.57, 0.38, 0.40, and 0.46, respectively; p < 0.05). No association was found for men. The distance for the 6MWT to predict an SF-36 score of 50 was 481 m for men in the physical functioning (AUC: 0.79) and role-physical (AUC: 0.84) domains, and 420 m for women in role-emotional (AUC: 0.75), role-physical (AUC: 0.80), and general health (AUC: 0.80) domains. Our results indicate that superior 6MWT performance may be associated with better HRQoL in several domains in only healthy older women. No association between 6MWT performance and role-emotional, mental health, or vitality domains was found.

Among the six RND efflux systems, VexAB exhibited broad substrate specificity and played a predominant role in intrinsic antimicrobial resistance. The VexAB system was encoded in an apparent three gene operon that included vexR; which encodes an uncharacterized TetR family regulator. In this work we examined the role of vexR in vexRAB expression. We found that VexR bound to the vexRAB promoter and vexR deletion resulted in decreased vexRAB expression and increased susceptibility to VexAB antimicrobial substrates. Substrate-dependent induction of vexRAB was dependent on vexR and episomal vexR expression provided a growth advantage in the presence of the VexAB substrate deoxycholate. The expression of vexRAB increased, in a vexR-dependent manner, in response to the loss of RND efflux activity. This suggested that VexAB may function to export intracellular metabolites. Support for this hypothesis was provided by data showing that vexRAB was upregulated in several metabolic mutants including tryptophan biosynthetic mutants that were predicted to accumulate indole. In addition, vexRAB was found to be upregulated in response to exogenous indole and to contribute to indole resistance. The collective results indicate that vexR is required for vexRAB expression in response to VexAB substrates and that the VexAB RND efflux system modulates the intracellular levels of metabolites that could otherwise accumulate to toxic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2029176887,"Like most of the strategies for cancer immunotherapy, photodynamic therapy-mediated vaccination has shown poor clinical outcomes in application. The aim of this study is to offer a glimpse at the mechanisms that are responsible for the failure based on cancer immuno-editing theory and to search for a positive solution. In this study we found that tumor cells were able to adapt themselves to the immune pressure exerted by vaccination. The survived tumor cells exhibited enhanced tumorigenic and stem-like phenotypes as well as undermined immunogenicity. Viewed as a whole, immune-selected tumor cells showed more malignant characteristics and the ability of immune escape, which might contribute to the eventual relapse. Thrombospondin-1 signaling via CD47 helped prevent tumor cells from becoming stem-like and rendered them vulnerable to immune attack. These findings prove that the TSP-1/CD47/SIRP-α signal axis is important to the evolution of tumor cells in the microenvironment of immunotherapy and identify thrombospondin-1 as a key signal with therapeutic benefits in overcoming long term relapse, providing new evidence for the clinical promise of cancer vaccination.

https://openalex.org/W2064024343,"Introduction Happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability, as recommended in the Sustainable Development Goals; however, little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities. To fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Methods Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. This study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. Results The results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. As expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. However, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. Conclusions The disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. Several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. For example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. Moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions."
https://openalex.org/W2066952508,"Background Recent population prevalence estimates of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are not available for several areas in India. We conducted a field-based population survey at a north Indian district to estimate point prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB. Methods A stratified cluster sampling design was used to conduct the survey in both urban and rural areas within the district. All adults aged more than 15 years, in 18 rural and 12 urban clusters of 3000 subjects each, were interviewed using a symptom card. Two sputum samples were collected from all persons having symptoms suggestive of PTB, or history of antitubercular treatment, for smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and mycobacterial culture. Those having at least one sputum specimen positive on microscopy and/or culture were categorized as having PTB. Prevalence was estimated after adjusting for cluster sampling and incomplete data (through individual level analysis with robust standard error). Results Of 91,030 eligible adult participants (47,714 men and 43,316 women), 85,770 (94.2%) completed the symptom cards. Of them, 2,898 persons were considered eligible for sputum examination and 2,839 (98.0%) provided at least one sample. Overall, 21 persons had bacteriologically positive PTB, and cluster level prevalence was estimated at 24.5 per 100,000 population (95% CI 12.8–36.2). Individual level analysis with robust standard error yielded a prevalence estimate of 24.1 per 100,000 populations (95% CI 12.8–35.4). Conclusion The observed prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB in this district is lower than empiric national estimates, probably as a result of successful implementation of tuberculosis control measures in the area."
https://openalex.org/W2018482625,"Myostatin (Mstn) knockout mice exhibit large increases in skeletal muscle mass. However, relatively few of the genes that mediate or modify MSTN effects are known. In this study, we performed co-expression network analysis using whole transcriptome microarray data from MSTN-null and wild-type mice to identify genes involved in important biological processes and pathways related to skeletal muscle and adipose development. Genes differentially expressed between wild-type and MSTN-null mice were further analyzed for shared DNA motifs using DREME. Differentially expressed genes were identified at 13.5 d.p.c. during primary myogenesis and at d35 during postnatal muscle development, but not at 17.5 d.p.c. during secondary myogenesis. In total, 283 and 2034 genes were differentially expressed at 13.5 d.p.c. and d35, respectively. Over-represented transcription factor binding sites in differentially expressed genes included SMAD3, SP1, ZFP187, and PLAGL1. The use of regulatory (RIF) and phenotypic (PIF) impact factor and differential hubbing co-expression analyses identified both known and potentially novel regulators of skeletal muscle growth, including Apobec2, Atp2a2, and Mmp13 at d35 and Sox2, Tmsb4x, and Vdac1 at 13.5 d.p.c. Among the genes with the highest PIF scores were many fiber type specifying genes. The use of RIF, PIF, and differential hubbing analyses identified both known and potentially novel regulators of muscle development. These results provide new details of how MSTN may mediate transcriptional regulation as well as insight into novel regulators of MSTN signal transduction that merit further study regarding their physiological roles in muscle and adipose development."
https://openalex.org/W2020052678,"Power-line frequency electromagnetic field (PF-EMF) was reported as a human carcinogen by some epidemiological research, but the conclusion is lack of robust experiment evidence. To identify the effects of long-term PF-EMF exposure on cell behavior, Balb/c 3T3 cells in exponential growth phase were exposed or sham-exposed to 50 Hertz (Hz) PF-EMF at 2.3 mT for 2 hours (h) one day, 5 days every week. After 11 weeks exposure, cells were collected instantly. Cell morphology was observed under invert microscope and Giemsa staining, cell viability was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry, the protein level of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and CyclinD1 was detected by western blot, cell transformation was examined by soft agar clone assay and plate clone forming test, and cell migration ability was observed by scratch adhesion test. It was found that after PF-EMF exposure, cell morphology, apoptosis, cell migration ability and cell transformation didn’t change. However, compared with sham group, cell viability obviously decreased and cell cycle distribution also changed after 11 weeks PF-EMF exposure. Meanwhile, the protein level of PCNA and CyclinD1 significantly decreased after PF-EMF exposure. These data suggested that although long-term 50Hz PF-EMF exposure under this experimental condition had no effects on apoptosis, cell migration ability and cell transformation, it could affect cell proliferation and cell cycle by down-regulation the expression of PCNA and CyclinD1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2041051287,"Medermycin and kalafungin, two antibacterial and antitumor antibiotics isolated from different streptomycetes, share an identical polyketide skeleton core. The present study reported the discovery of kalafungin in a medermycin-producing streptomycete strain for the first time. A mutant strain obtained through UV mutagenesis showed a 3-fold increase in the production of this antibiotic, compared to the wild type strain. Heterologous expression experiments suggested that its production was severely controlled by the gene cluster for medermycin biosynthesis. In all, these findings suggested that kalafungin and medermycin could be accumulated by the same streptomycete and share their biosynthetic pathway to some extent in this strain."
https://openalex.org/W1968785175,"The effect static magnetic field (SMF)-exposure may exert on edema development has been investigated. A 6 h long whole-body (WBSMF) or local (LSMF), continuous, inhomogeneous SMF-exposure was applied on anesthetized mice in an in vivo model of mustard oil (MO)-induced ear edema. LSMF was applied below the treated ear, below the lumbar spine, or below the mandible. Ear thickness (v) was checked 8 times during the exposure period (at 0, 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h). The effect size of the applied treatment (η) on ear thickness was calculated by the formula η = 100% × (1-v(j)/v(i)), where group i is the control group and j is the treated group. Results showed that MO treatment in itself induced a significant ear edema with an effect of 9% (p<0.001). WBSMF or LSMF on the spine in combination with MO treatment increased ear thickness even further resulting in an effect of η>11% in both cases compared to SMF-exposure alone (p<0.001). In these cases SMF-exposure alone without MO treatment reduced ear thickness significantly (p<0.05), but within estimated experimental error. In cases of LSMF-exposure on the head, a significant SMF-exposure induced ear thickness reduction was found (η = 5%, p<0.05). LSMF-exposure on the spine affected ear thickness with and without MO treatment almost identically, which provides evidence that the place of local SMF action may be in the lower spinal region."
https://openalex.org/W1988842944,"We present new modifications to the Wuchty algorithm in order to better define and explore possible conformations for an RNA sequence. The new features, including parallelization, energy-independent lonely pair constraints, context-dependent chemical probing constraints, helix filters, and optional multibranch loops, provide useful tools for exploring the landscape of RNA folding. Chemical probing alone may not necessarily define a single unique structure. The helix filters and optional multibranch loops are global constraints on RNA structure that are an especially useful tool for generating models of encapsidated viral RNA for which cryoelectron microscopy or crystallography data may be available. The computations generate a combinatorially complete set of structures near a free energy minimum and thus provide data on the density and diversity of structures near the bottom of a folding funnel for an RNA sequence. The conformational landscapes for some RNA sequences may resemble a low, wide basin rather than a steep funnel that converges to a single structure."
https://openalex.org/W2010745110,"p53 is an important tumor suppressor gene which is mutated in ~50% of all human cancers. Some of these mutants appear to have acquired novel functions beyond merely losing wild-type functions. To investigate these gain-of-function effects in vivo, we generated mice of three different genotypes: MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+), MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-), and MMTV-Hras/p53R172H/R172H. Salivary tumors from these mice were characterized with regard to age of tumor onset, tumor growth rates, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic levels, tumor histopathology, as well as response to doxorubicin treatment. Microarray analysis was also performed to profile gene expression. The MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53R172H/R172H mice displayed similar properties with regard to age of tumor onset, tumor growth rates, tumor histopathology, and response to doxorubicin, while both groups were clearly distinct from the MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+) mice by these measurements. In addition, the gene expression profiles of the MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53(R172H/R172H) tumors were tightly clustered, and clearly distinct from the profiles of the MMTV-Hras/p53(+/+) tumors. Only a small group of genes showing differential expression between the MMTV-Hras/p53(-/-) and MMTV-Hras/p53(R172H/R172H) tumors, that did not appear to be regulated by wild-type p53, were identified. Taken together, these results indicate that in this MMTV-Hras-driven salivary tumor model, the major effect of the p53 R172H mutant is due to the loss of wild-type p53 function, with little or no gain-of-function effect on tumorigenesis, which may be explained by the tissue- and tumor type-specific properties of this gain-of-function mutant of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2078379591,"In neurophysiology researches, peripheral stimulation is used along with recordings of neural activities to study the processing of somatosensory signals in the brain. However, limited precision of peripheral stimulation makes it difficult to activate the neuron with millisecond resolution and study its functional properties in this scale. Also, tissue/receptor damage that could occur in some experiments often limits the amount of responses that can be recorded and hence reduces data reproducibility. To overcome these limitations, electrical microstimulation (ES) of the brain could be used to directly and more precisely evoke neural responses. For this purpose, a deep-brain ES protocol for rat somatosensory relay neurons was developed in this study. Three male Wistar rats were used in the experiment. The ES was applied to the thalamic region responsive to hindpaw tactile stimulation (TS) via a theta glass microelectrode. The resulting ES-evoked cortical responses showed action potentials and thalamocortical relay latencies very similar to those evoked by TS. This result shows that the developed deep-brain ES protocol is an effective tool to bypass peripheral tissue for in vivo functional analysis of specific types of somatosensory neurons. This protocol could be readily applied in researches of nociception and other somatosensory systems to allow more extensive exploration of the neural functional networks."
