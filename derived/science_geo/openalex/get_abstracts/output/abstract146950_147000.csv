https://openalex.org/W2149536871,"Root formation in plants involves the continuous interpretation of positional cues. Physiological studies have linked root formation to auxins. An auxin response element displays a maximum in the Arabidopsis root and we investigate its developmental significance. Auxin response mutants reduce the maximum or its perception, and interfere with distal root patterning. Polar auxin transport mutants affect its localization and distal pattern. Polar auxin transport inhibitors cause dramatic relocalization of the maximum, and associated changes in pattern and polarity. Auxin application and laser ablations correlate root pattern with a maximum adjacent to the vascular bundle. Our data indicate that an auxin maximum at a vascular boundary establishes a distal organizer in the root."

The genomic sequence provides access to the complete structures of all genes, including those without known function, their control elements, and, by inference, the proteins they encode, as well as all other biologically important sequences. Furthermore, the sequence is a rich and permanent source of information for the design of further biological studies of the organism and for the study of evolution through cross-species sequence comparison. The power of this approach has been amply demonstrated by the determination of the sequences of a number of microbial and model organisms. The next step is to obtain the complete sequence of the entire human genome. Here we report the sequence of the euchromatic part of human chromosome 22. The sequence obtained consists of 12 contiguous segments spanning 33.4 megabases, contains at least 545 genes and 134 pseudogenes, and provides the first view of the complex chromosomal landscapes that will be found in the rest of the genome."

https://openalex.org/W2008808301,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vivo has been linked to a viral etiology of vascular disease. In this report, we demonstrate that HCMV infection of primary arterial SMCs results in significant cellular migration. Ablation of the chemokine receptor, US28, abrogates SMC migration, which is rescued only by expression of the viral homolog and not a cellular G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Expression of US28 in the presence of CC chemokines including RANTES or MCP-1 was sufficient to promote SMC migration by both chemokinesis and chemotaxis, which was inhibited by protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors. US28-mediated SMC migration provides a molecular basis for the correlative evidence that links HCMV to the acceleration of vascular disease."

Here we show that Bt toxin is released into the rhizosphere soil in root exudates from Bt corn.

https://openalex.org/W2164400934,"Using gene trap mutagenesis, we have identified a mutation in mice that causes exencephaly, acrania, facial clefting, and spina bifida, all of which can be attributed to failed neural tube closure. This mutation is designated shroom (shrm) because the neural folds ""mushroom"" outward and do not converge at the dorsal midline. shrm encodes a PDZ domain protein that is involved at several levels in regulating aspects of cytoarchitecture. First, endogenous Shrm localizes to adherens junctions and the cytoskeleton. Second, ectopically expressed Shrm alters the subcellular distribution of F-actin. Third, Shrm directly binds F-actin. Finally, cytoskeletal polarity within the neuroepithelium is perturbed in mutant embryos. In concert, these observations suggest that Shrm is a critical determinant of the cellular architecture required for proper neurulation."

https://openalex.org/W2028588248,"p27Xic1, a member of the Cip/Kip family of Cdk inhibitors, besides its known function of inhibiting cell division, induces Müller glia from retinoblasts. This novel gliogenic function of p27Xic1 is mediated by part of the N-terminal domain near but distinct from the region that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases. Cotransfections with dominant-negative and constitutively active Delta and Notch constructs indicate that the gliogenic effects of p27Xic1 work within the context of an active Notch pathway. The gradual increase of p27Xic1 in the developing retina thus not only limits the number of retinal cells but also increasingly favors the fate of the last cell type to be born in the retina, the Müller glia."

https://openalex.org/W2155824282,"Melanoma chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (MCSP) is a cell-surface antigen that has been implicated in the growth and invasion of melanoma tumours. Although this antigen is expressed early in melanoma progression, its biological function is unknown. MCSP can stimulate the integrin-α4β1-mediated adhesion and spreading of melanoma cells. Here we show that stimulated MCSP recruits tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas, an adaptor protein important in tumour cell motility and invasion. MCSP stimulation also results in a pronounced activation and recruitment of the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42. MCSP-induced spreading of melanoma cells is dependent upon active Cdc42, a Cdc42-associated tyrosine kinase (Ack-1) and tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. Furthermore, vectors inhibiting Ack-1 or Cdc42 expression and/or function abrogate MCSP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of p130cas. Our findings indicate that MCSP may modify tumour growth or invasion by a unique signal-transduction pathway that links Cdc42 activation to downstream tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2080315587,"The interaction of the serine/threonine kinase Pelle and adaptor protein Tube through their N-terminal death domains leads to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Dorsal and activation of zygotic patterning genes during Drosophila embryogenesis. Crystal structure of the Pelle and Tube death domain heterodimer reveals that the two death domains adopt a six-helix bundle fold and are arranged in an open-ended linear array with plastic interfaces mediating their interactions. The Tube death domain has an insertion between helices 2 and 3, and a C-terminal tail making significant and indispensable contacts in the heterodimer. In vivo assays of Pelle and Tube mutants confirmed that the integrity of the major heterodimer interface is critical to the activity of these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2059184776,"RNA triphosphatase is an essential mRNA processing enzyme that catalyzes the first step in cap formation. The 2.05 A crystal structure of yeast RNA triphosphatase Cet1p reveals a novel active site fold whereby an eight-stranded beta barrel forms a topologically closed triphosphate tunnel. Interactions of a sulfate in the center of the tunnel with a divalent cation and basic amino acids projecting into the tunnel suggest a catalytic mechanism that is supported by mutational data. Discrete surface domains mediate Cet1p homodimerization and Cet1p binding to the guanylyltransferase component of the capping apparatus. The structure and mechanism of fungal RNA triphosphatases are completely different from those of mammalian mRNA capping enzymes. Hence, RNA triphosphatase presents an ideal target for structure-based antifungal drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W1636862740,"The Milky Way's halo contains clouds of neutral hydrogen with high radial velocities which do not follow the general rotational motion of the Galaxy1. Few distances to these high-velocity clouds are known2,3, so even gross properties such as total mass are hard to determine. As a consequence, there is no generally accepted theory regarding their origin. One idea4,5 is that they result from gas that has cooled after being ejected from the Galaxy through fountain-like flows powered by supernovae; another is that they are composed of gas, poor in heavy elements, which is falling onto the disk of the Milky Way from intergalactic space6,7. The presence of molecular hydrogen, whose formation generally requires the presence of dust (and therefore gas, enriched in heavy elements), could help to distinguish between these possibilities. Here we report the discovery of molecular hydrogen absorption in a high-velocity cloud along the line of sight to the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also derive for the same cloud an iron abundance which is half of the solar value. From these data, we conclude that gas in this cloud originated in the disk of the Milky Way."
