https://openalex.org/W2120246444,"Subsets of long-lived, tumor-initiating stem cells often escape cancer therapies. However, sources and mechanisms that generate tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistant cell population are still unfolding. Here, we devise a functional reporter system to lineage trace and/or genetic ablate signaling in TGF-β-activated squamous cell carcinoma stem cells (SCC-SCs). Dissecting TGF-β's impact on malignant progression, we demonstrate that TGF-β concentrating near tumor-vasculature generates heterogeneity in TGF-β signaling at tumor-stroma interface and bestows slower-cycling properties to neighboring SCC-SCs. While non-responding progenies proliferate faster and accelerate tumor growth, TGF-β-responding progenies invade, aberrantly differentiate, and affect gene expression. Intriguingly, TGF-β-responding SCC-SCs show increased protection against anti-cancer drugs, but slower-cycling alone does not confer survival. Rather, TGF-β transcriptionally activates p21, which stabilizes NRF2, thereby markedly enhancing glutathione metabolism and diminishing effectiveness of anti-cancer therapeutics. Together, these findings establish a surprising non-genetic paradigm for TGF-β signaling in fueling heterogeneity in SCC-SCs, tumor characteristics, and drug resistance."

To satisfy this unmet need, we developed the Dynamic BH3 Profiling technique to measure early changes in net pro-apoptotic signaling at the mitochondrion (“priming”) induced by chemotherapeutic agents in cancer cells, not requiring prolonged ex vivo culture. We find in cell line and clinical experiments that early drug-induced death signaling measured by Dynamic BH3 Profiling predicts chemotherapy response across many cancer types and many agents, including combinations of chemotherapies.

A fundamental challenge across medicine is to assign to a patient the drug or combination of drugs that will be of greatest benefit. In oncology, this choice has historically been driven by the anatomic location and histology of the tumor. Later, therapeutic decision-making was assisted by immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and flow cytometric analysis of cell surface antigens. In more recent years, there are examples where gene expression signatures and specific genetic alterations have been essential to therapeutic decisions (Chapman et al., 2011Chapman P.B. Hauschild A. Robert C. Haanen J.B. Ascierto P. Larkin J. Dummer R. Garbe C. Testori A. Maio M. et al.BRIM-3 Study GroupImproved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.N. Engl. J.

However, true personalization of therapy remains an elusive goal in most cases. In all too many cases, cancer patients show little benefit from therapy. Moreover, it is likely that many tumors have unrecognized sensitivity to agents for which there is simply no useful predictive biomarker to inform therapy decisions (Garraway and Jänne, 2012Garraway L.A. Jänne P.A. Circumventing cancer drug resistance in the era of personalized medicine.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, Haibe-Kains et al., 2013Haibe-Kains B.

In this era of growing therapeutic options, there is a comparable growing need for predictive biomarkers (Sawyers, 2008Sawyers C.L. The cancer biomarker problem.Nature. 2008; 452: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, Yaffe, 2013Yaffe M.B. The scientific drunk and the lamppost: massive sequencing efforts in cancer discovery and treatment.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: pe13Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A feature common to nearly all of the biomarkers in use or in development in oncology is that they are studies performed on dead cancer cells. They are attempts to predict cancer cell behavior based on detailed analysis of components of the cell, such as DNA, RNA, or proteins (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V. Sonkin D. et al.The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity.Nature. 2012; 483: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (4856) Google Scholar). In some cases, abnormalities in single genes are studied. There are spectacular examples of success with this approach, such as the use of EGFR mutations to guide treatment with EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer (Paez et al., 2004Paez J.G. Jänne P.A. Lee J.C. Tracy S. Greulich H. Gabriel S. Herman P. Kaye F.J. Lindeman N.

Hauschild A. Robert C. Haanen J.B. Ascierto P. Larkin J. Dummer R. Garbe C. Testori A. Maio M. et al.BRIM-3 Study GroupImproved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.N. Engl.

Effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 in a patient with a metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). However, most drugs in development or approved for cancer lack a simple genetic predictor, which impedes their clinical development (Sikorski and Yao, 2010Sikorski R. Yao B. Visualizing the landscape of selection biomarkers in current phase III oncology clinical trials.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 34ps27Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One popular approach to this problem is to identify signatures based on huge amounts of information based on genomes, transcriptomes, or proteomes (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N. Venkatesan K. Margolin A.A. Kim S. Wilson C.J. Lehár J. Kryukov G.V.

Jänne P.A. Circumventing cancer drug resistance in the era of personalized medicine.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 214-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These strategies are relatively early in development and their power remains to be seen. Despite the abundance of information these strategies provide, they still share a weakness: they are all studies of dead cancer cells. They lack a measure of cancer cell function or response to perturbation. Studies of complex systems in and out of biology are often greatly augmented by observations of responses to strategic perturbations. Here, we present results of strategic perturbations of cancer cells with drugs and their mitochondria with peptides in a strategy we call Dynamic BH3 Profiling (DBP). DBP interrogates the BCL-2 family of proteins that regulates commitment to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, the program of cell death that is commonly used by cancer cells in response to most chemotherapeutic agents. The BCL-2 family of proteins controls mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) (Certo et al., 2006Certo M. Del Gaizo Moore V. Nishino M. Wei G. Korsmeyer S. Armstrong S.A. Letai A.

The effector proteins BAX and BAK, when activated, oligomerize to form pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane that induce release of cytochrome c and the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, as well as release of SMAC/DIABLO and other proteins that trigger apoptosome formation, caspase activation, and finally apoptosis (Kluck et al., 1997Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria: a primary site for Bcl-2 regulation of apoptosis.Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar, Wei et al., 2001Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). These effector proteins can be activated by the BH3-only proteins BIM and BID (and perhaps PUMA), also known as activators (Sarosiek et al., 2013Sarosiek K.A. Chi X. Bachman J.A. Sims J.J. Montero J. Patel L. Flanagan A. Andrews D.W. Sorger P. Letai A. BID preferentially activates BAK while BIM preferentially activates BAX, affecting chemotherapy response.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51: 751-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both effectors and activators can be inhibited by the anti-apoptotic members of the family, including BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1 and others (Certo et al., 2006Certo M. Del Gaizo Moore V. Nishino M. Wei G. Korsmeyer S. Armstrong S.A. Letai A. Mitochondria primed by death signals determine cellular addiction to antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). There is a fourth group of proteins, called sensitizers (comprising proteins like BAD, BMF, NOXA, HRK, and others) that by themselves are not able to induce BAX and BAK oligomerization but instead selectively inhibit the anti-apoptotic members of the family, thus indirectly promoting MOMP (Letai et al., 2002Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Distinct BH3 domains either sensitize or activate mitochondrial apoptosis, serving as prototype cancer therapeutics.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain is a roughly 20-amino acid amphipathic alpha helix that is necessary for most of the hetero-dimeric interactions of BCL-2 family proteins that regulate apoptosis. Synthetic BH3 domain oligopeptides can execute most of the pro-apoptotic functions of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (Certo et al., 2006Certo M. Del Gaizo Moore V. Nishino M. Wei G. Korsmeyer S. Armstrong S.A. Letai A. Mitochondria primed by death signals determine cellular addiction to antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). BH3 peptides are thus a convenient, titratable reagent that can be exploited to systematically study mitochondrial readiness to undergo apoptosis. This understanding of the BCL-2 family of proteins and their interactions allowed the development of the BH3 profiling technique (Ryan et al., 2010Ryan J.A. Brunelle J.K. Letai A. Heightened mitochondrial priming is the basis for apoptotic hypersensitivity of CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 12895-12900Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that identifies cancer cells’ selective dependence on anti-apoptotic proteins, and also measures overall apoptotic sensitivity or “priming for death” (Deng et al., 2007aDeng J. Carlson N. Takeyama K. Dal Cin P. Shipp M. Letai A. BH3 profiling identifies three distinct classes of apoptotic blocks to predict response to ABT-737 and conventional chemotherapeutic agents.Cancer Cell. 2007; 12: 171-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). “Priming” is a measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis. Procedurally, priming corresponds to the sensitivity of mitochondria to BH3 peptides. The more sensitive mitochondria are to BH3 peptides, the more primed they are. We have previously found that the state of “priming” prior to therapy was an excellent predictor of chemotherapeutic response in vivo (Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011Ni Chonghaile T. Sarosiek K.A. Vo T.T. Ryan J.A. Tammareddi A. Moore Vdel.G. Deng J. Anderson K.C. Richardson P. Tai Y.T. et al.Pretreatment mitochondrial priming correlates with clinical response to cytotoxic chemotherapy.Science. 2011; 334: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, Vo et al., 2012Vo T.T.

Relative mitochondrial priming of myeloblasts and normal HSCs determines chemotherapeutic success in AML.Cell. 2012; 151: 344-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Differences in priming between cancer cells and normal tissues also provide an explanation for the therapeutic index of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs that target ubiquitous elements such as DNA and microtubules. The main principle of DBP is to expose cancer cells to short incubations with drugs of interest and measure whether the drug exposure induces an increase in priming compared to an untreated control. In this paper we use DBP to test the hypothesis that early death signaling predicts cytotoxicity, even when the cell death does not occur until days after the death signaling is measured. Our results support the model that initiation of death signaling is the main regulator of eventual commitment to cell death. Moreover, we show that we can perform these measurements on primary patient cancer cells in a way that predicts clinical response to therapy. Our strategy rests upon the hypothesis that it is the initiation of death signaling that distinguishes cells destined to be killed by an agent from those destined to survive. We therefore rigorously tested the hypothesis that measurement of early death signaling by DBP (Figure 1A) could predict a cytotoxic response that did not occur until several days later. We first used non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines derived from PC9. This cell line has an exon 19 deletion in the EGFR gene rendering it sensitive to EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) like erlotinib or gefitinib. PC9GR was obtained by continuously exposing PC9 to increasing concentrations of gefitinib (Ercan et al., 2010Ercan D. Zejnullahu K. Yonesaka K. Xiao Y. Capelletti M. Rogers A. Lifshits E. Brown A. Lee C. Christensen J.G. et al.Amplification of EGFR T790M causes resistance to an irreversible EGFR inhibitor.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), selecting for a T790M mutation in EGFR that renders it non-sensitive to gefitinib but still sensitive to the mutant selective EGFR TKI WZ4002 (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou W. Ercan D. Chen L. Yun C.H. Li D. Capelletti M. Cortot A.B. Chirieac L. Iacob R.E. Padera R. et al.Novel mutant-selective EGFR kinase inhibitors against EGFR T790M.Nature. 2009; 462: 1070-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). A third cell line, PC9WZR, was similarly selected for resistance to WZ4002. It possesses an EGFR T790M mutation and a MAPK1 amplification conferring resistance to both gefitinib and WZ4002. However, PC9WZR is sensitive to the combination of WZ4002 with the MEK inhibitor CI-1040, by completely blocking the MAPK pathway (Ercan et al., 2012Ercan D. Xu C. Yanagita M. Monast C.S. Pratilas C.A. Montero J. Butaney M. Shimamura T. Sholl L. Ivanova E.V. et al.Reactivation of ERK signaling causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This set of cell lines provided a useful initial model of differential sensitivity to targeted therapies upon which to test our strategy. We performed DBP on each of the cell lines using a 16 hr treatment with gefitinib, WZ4002, CI-1040 or the combination WZ4002 plus CI-1040. Sixteen hours was chosen after empirically testing 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 hr as it was the earliest time point that reliably provided a significant change in priming in PC9 cells treated with gefitinib. After testing several BH3 peptides, including BIM, HRK, and PUMA BH3, we found that BIM BH3 concentrations of 0.3 and 1 μM provided the most useful dynamic range (Figure 1 and Figure S1). Drug concentrations were chosen based on our and others’ prior experience and the dose required for a complete blockade of the MAPK pathway (Ercan et al., 2012Ercan D. Xu C. Yanagita M. Monast C.S. Pratilas C.A. Montero J. Butaney M. Shimamura T. Sholl L. Ivanova E.V. et al.Reactivation of ERK signaling causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 934-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Ercan et al., 2010Ercan D.

Christensen J.G. et al.Amplification of EGFR T790M causes resistance to an irreversible EGFR inhibitor.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2346-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We observed an increase in priming induced in PC9 by gefitinib, WZ4002 and WZ4002 + CI-1040, as shown by the increase in BIM BH3-induced mitochondrial depolarization (Δ% priming). In PC9GR cells, WZ4002, but not gefitinib, increased priming. In PC9WZR cells, only the WZ4002 + CI-1040 increased mitochondrial priming (Figure 1B). We next measured cell death at 72 hr for the same cell lines following the same treatments using FACS analysis of Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Figure 1C). When we compared Δ% priming and Δ% cell death, we observed an excellent correlation between both measurements (Figure 1D. left). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was also excellent, performing perfectly in this small number of tests (Figure 1D, right). Note that DBP was performed at 16 hr when no significant cell death was evident, whereas cell death was analyzed more than 2 days later (Figure S2). Thus, the early priming increase measured by DBP provided accurate, drug-specific predictions about cytotoxicity even though the death took place days later.Figure S2Gefitinib and WZ4002 Response Over Time, Related to Figure 1Show full captionCell death was monitored over time on parental PC9, PC9GR and PC9WZR cell lines in response to gefitinib 1 μM and WZ4002 100 nM.

Measurements at 24, 48 and 72 hr were performed by FACS using Annexin V/PI staining. Values indicate mean ± SEM, at least three independent experiments were performed (n ≥ 3). DBP should only be predictive if the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is being engaged. To confirm this engagement, we analyzed PARP cleavage, as well as levels of BIM, BCL-2, and BCL-XL proteins following 24 hr of drug treatment. When cytotoxicity was observed, PARP cleavage was detected. In addition, cytotoxicity correlated with either increases in BIM, decreases in anti-apoptotic proteins, or a combination of both effects, supporting the simultaneous participation of multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the determination of cell fate (Deng et al., 2007bDeng J. Shimamura T. Perera S. Carlson N.E. Cai D. Shapiro G.I. Wong K.K. Letai A.

In order to determine if this predictive capacity of DBP could be generalized to other NSCLC models, we treated six different NSCLC cell lines with gefitinib, WZ4002, AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor), BEZ235 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), and the combination AZD6244 + BEZ235, that was previously described to treat murine lung cancers harboring the KRas G12D mutation (Engelman et al., 2008Engelman J.A. Chen L. Tan X. Crosby K. Guimaraes A.R. Upadhyay R. Maira M. McNamara K. Perera S.A. Song Y. et al.Effective use of PI3K and MEK inhibitors to treat mutant Kras G12D and PIK3CA H1047R murine lung cancers.Nat.

USA. 2009; 106: 19503-19508Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We chose drug concentrations that had previously demonstrated in vitro cytotoxicity. Again, we compared the priming increase measured by DBP after 16 hr of treatment with cell death observed at 72 hr (Figure S3A). Some of the cell lines analyzed had a tendency to show less cytotoxicity than would be expected by DBP for a few drugs. It is possible that measurement of cell death at longer time points would reduce such disagreements. Nonetheless, we observed a significant correlation between Δ% priming and Δ% cell death when all cell lines and treatments were considered (Figure S3B). To assess if DBP provided a useful binary predictor of cytotoxicity, we performed ROC curve analysis (Pencina et al., 2008Pencina M.J. D’Agostino Sr., R.B. D’Agostino Jr., R.B. Vasan R.S. Evaluating the added predictive ability of a new marker: from area under the ROC curve to reclassification and beyond.Stat Med. 2008; 27 (discussion 207-112): 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (4785) Google Scholar). Typically, a random classifier would present an AUC of 0.5, while a perfect classifier would have a AUC of 1. In this case, the area under the ROC curve is 0.895 (Figure S3C), comparing favorably with the ROC performance of many clinically used predictors (Burstein et al., 2011Burstein H.J. Mangu P.B. Somerfield M.R. Schrag D. Samson D. Holt L. Zelman D. Ajani J.A. American Society of Clinical OncologyAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update on the use of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance assays.J. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 29: 3328-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Note that this analysis relies not simply on measurements of the baseline priming but rather on the degree to which drugs increase priming from that baseline. To test the generalizability of our hypothesis in a different type of cancer, we performed a similar set of experiments with five different human breast cancer cell lines treated with gefitinib, lapatinib (HER2 inhibitor), MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor), BEZ235 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), dinaciclib (SCH 727965, CDK inhibitor), ABT-888 (PARP inhibitor), and the combination AZD6244 + BEZ235, as previously described (Faber et al., 2009Faber A.C. Li D. Song Y. Liang M.C. Yeap B.Y. Bronson R.T. Lifshits E. Chen Z. Maira S.M. García-Echeverría C. et al.Differential induction of apoptosis in HER2 and EGFR addicted cancers following PI3K inhibition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 19503-19508Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Again we observed a significant correlation between Δ% priming after 16 hr of treatment and Δ% cell death at 96 hr (Figures 2A and 2B ). The area under the ROC curve for this set of cell lines is 0.93 (Figure 2C), thus objectively DBP is an excellent binary predictor for breast cancer cell lines’ response to chemotherapy. In clinical practice, an important application of a potentially powerful, widely applicable predictive biomarker would be to choose from among a panel of possible therapies (Sawyers, 2008Sawyers C.L. The cancer biomarker problem.Nature. 2008; 452: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). This is the central goal of what is currently commonly termed “precision medicine.” We hypothesized that if we could compare the death signaling induced by several different agents in a cancer cell, we could pick the ones that would work best. To test this principle, we selected ten different cancer cell lines, chosen simply by variety and availability. For drugs, we chose nine kinase inhibitors, for their diversity of targets and known in vivo activity. We chose kinase inhibitors because of their known use of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway to kill cancer cells (Bhatt et al., 2010Bhatt A.P. Bhende P.M. Sin S.H. Roy D. Dittmer D.P. Damania B. Dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR inhibits autocrine and paracrine proliferative loops in PI3K/Akt/mTOR-addicted lymphomas.Blood. 2010; 115: 4455-4463Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, Faber et al., 2011Faber A.C.

Song Y. et al.BIM expression in treatment-naive cancers predicts responsiveness to kinase inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2011; 1: 352-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Our question was, among these diverse cell lines and drugs, could DBP at an early time point be used to make individualized choices of the drugs most likely to kill each cancer cell line. For this purpose we selected drugs targeting either key membrane receptor tyrosine kinases like gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), imatinib (ABL inhibitor), lapatinib (HER2 inhibitor), PD173074 (FGFR inhibitor), and TAE684 (ALK inhibitor) or important intracellular serine/threonine kinases including MK-2206 (AKT inhibitor), PLX4032 (BRAFV600E inhibitor), AZD6244 (MEK inhibitor), and BEZ235 (PI3K/mTOR inhibitor). All of the compounds tested previously demonstrated cytotoxicty in cancer cell lines and/or murine cancer models, including hematological malignancies (Bhatt et al., 2010Bhatt A.P. Bhende P.M.

Flaherty K. et al.Elucidating distinct roles for NF1 in melanomagenesis.Cancer Discov. 2013; 3: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We tested the panel of kinase inhibitors on several human hematological cancer cell lines: K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia or CML), DHL6 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), LP1 (multiple myeloma), DHL4 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and AML3 (acute myelogenous leukemia). First, we performed DBP after 16 hr exposure to the different treatments (Figure 3A). We compared the DBP results to cell death achieved at 72 hr, expressed as Δ% cell death (Figure 3A). Each cell line demonstrated a distinct pattern of drug induced priming increase, a distinct fingerprint of pathway addiction just as there was a distinct pattern of cytotoxic response to the drug panel. Most importantly for our question, however, there was an excellent correlation of DBP with cytotoxicity days later (Figure 3B). For this set of hematological cell lines, predictive power of DBP was demonstrated by an AUC of the ROC curve of 0.83 (Figure 3C). Note that DBP identified the agent causing greatest cytotoxicity in four out of five cell lines. In the one exception, LP-1, there was little cytotoxicity induced by any of the drugs. We next examined the predictive capacity of DBP with several diverse human solid tumor cell lines: MCF7 (breast cancer), PC9 (non-small cell lung cancer), SK-MEL-5 (melanoma), HCT116 (colon carcinoma) and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer). We exposed the cells to the different treatments for 16 hr and performed DBP (Figure 4A ), comparing it with the cell death observed at 72–96 hr (Figure 4A). In some cases, a 96 hr time point was required due to slow kinetics of cytotoxicity. Similarly, as observed for hematological malignancies, the different cell lines responded differently to the drugs tested, but a significant correlation between DBP and cytotoxicity was detected (Figure 4B). SK-MEL-5 was the only one sensitive to PLX4032, as expected for a BRAFV600E expressing melanoma cell line, but was also sensitive to MEK (AZD6244) and PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235) inhibition, correlating with the cell death detected three days later, at 96 hr.

However, its origins and modulation by environmental factors have not been examined systematically. Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 β-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes."

For viruses such as HIV, the prevailing hypothesis is that latent infection is controlled by cellular state (i.e., environment), with latency simply an epiphenomenon of infected cells transitioning from an activated to resting state. However, we find that HIV expression persists despite the activated-to-resting cellular transition. Mathematical modeling indicates that HIV’s Tat positive-feedback circuitry enables this persistence and strongly controls latency. To overcome the inherent crosstalk between viral circuitry and cellular activation and to directly test this hypothesis, we synthetically decouple viral dependence on cellular environment from viral transcription.

Overall, synthetic reconstruction demonstrates that a largely autonomous, viral-encoded program underlies HIV latency—potentially explaining why cell-targeted latency-reversing agents exhibit incomplete penetrance. Diverse biological systems, both natural and engineered, face the challenge of surviving in variant and unpredictable environmental conditions. One strategy is to sense surrounding conditions and respond with environment-specific developmental programs—there is a 1:1 correspondence between explicit sensor-actuators and the extremely reduced form of this scheme in which sensing and actuation are so tightly coupled that environment entirely actuates the program (Bull and Vogt, 1979Bull J.J. Vogt R.C. Temperature-dependent sex determination in turtles.Science. 1979; 206: 1186-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). An alternate strategy foregoes environmental sensing and actuation, instead relying on autonomous programs (Knedler, 1947Knedler J.W. Masterworks of Science—Digests of 13 Great Classics. Doubleday & Company, Garden City, NY1947Google Scholar), for example programs that intrinsically generate heterogeneity in phenotypes and allow probabilistic “bet hedging” (Cohen, 1966Cohen D. Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment.J. Theor. Biol. 1966; 12: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). For many systems, such as bacteriophage-λ, it is unclear whether environmental sensor-actuator schemes or autonomous programs are employed (Arkin et al., 1998Arkin A. Ross J. McAdams H.H. Stochastic kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage lambda-infected Escherichia coli cells.Genetics. 1998; 149: 1633-1648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, St-Pierre and Endy, 2008St-Pierre F.

Decision making at a subcellular level determines the outcome of bacteriophage infection.Cell. 2010; 141: 682-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The ensuing debates carry evolutionary significance since sensor-actuator regulation can be driven by crosstalk from coincidental signals and hence tied to unrelated epiphenomena, whereas autonomous circuits are invariably subjected to direct natural selection pressures. In other words, if a phenotype is controlled by sensor-actuator regulation, it can be an “epiphenomenon,” but if autonomously regulated, the phenotype is invariably evolutionary hardwired and directly selected for. For HIV, the debate is clinically relevant; it remains unclear whether the host-cell environment or autonomous viral circuitry controls proviral latency, a long-lived viral dormancy state that is the chief barrier to curative therapy (Richman et al., 2009Richman D.D. Margolis D.M. Delaney M. Greene W.C. Hazuda D. Pomerantz R.J.

Stochastic fate selection in HIV-infected patients.Cell. 2013; 155: 497-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Upon infecting CD4+ T lymphocytes, HIV either actively replicates to rapidly produce progeny virions or can enter a long-lived quiescent state (proviral latency), from which it subsequently reactivates. These latently infected cells form a viral reservoir, forcing patients to remain on lifelong suppressive therapy. The prevailing view (Coffin and Swanstrom, 2013Coffin J. Swanstrom R. HIV pathogenesis: dynamics and genetics of viral populations and infected cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2013; 3: a012526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, Siliciano and Greene, 2011Siliciano R.F. Greene W.C. HIV latency.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2011; 1: a007096Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) holds that proviral latency results from HIV transcription being controlled by the host-cell activation state (i.e., environment) since relaxation of activated lymphocytes to a resting-memory state is correlated with increased epigenetic silencing of the HIV promoter and increased cytoplasmic sequestration of transcription factors that activate HIV transcription (Pearson et al., 2008Pearson R. Kim Y.K. Hokello J. Lassen K. Friedman J. Tyagi M. Karn J.

Establishment of HIV latency in primary CD4+ cells is due to epigenetic transcriptional silencing and P-TEFb restriction.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 6425-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this model, HIV infects activated T cells, which allow active viral replication, and if these cells “relax” to resting-memory T cells, which generally restrict HIV infection, viral latency ensues (Figure 1, left). In contrast to the cellular control hypothesis, there is circumstantial evidence for an alternate model wherein latency is controlled by viral gene-regulatory circuitry (Ho et al., 2013Ho Y.C. Shan L. Hosmane N.N. Wang J. Laskey S.B. Rosenbloom D.I. Lai J. Blankson J.N. Siliciano J.D. Siliciano R.F.

HIV encodes a transcriptional master circuit that is driven by the HIV Tat protein, which amplifies expression from the viral promoter within the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), establishing positive feedback. Critically, minimal Tat positive-feedback circuits can recapitulate latency, and stochastic fluctuations between a transcriptionally on and off state in the Tat circuit are sufficient to drive a phenotypic bifurcation between active and latent expression, even in non-resting cells (Weinberger et al., 2005Weinberger L.S. Burnett J.C. Toettcher J.E. Arkin A.P. Schaffer D.V. Stochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 Tat fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.Cell. 2005; 122: 169-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence that cellular factors modulate stochastic HIV expression to drive latency (Burnett et al., 2009Burnett J.C. Miller-Jensen K. Shah P.S. Arkin A.P. Schaffer D.V. Control of stochastic gene expression by host factors at the HIV promoter.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000260Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), confounding the hypothesis that latency is controlled by an autonomous viral circuit. Here, we test between the cell-state and autonomous-circuit hypotheses for latency establishment. If latency is regulated by host-cell state, viral expression should be tightly correlated with cell state, whereas if the latency circuit is hardwired to function autonomously, then cellular state would be uncorrelated with viral expression and tuning viral circuitry, independent of cell state, would be sufficient to control HIV latency (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, we find that viral expression is robust to cellular-activation state in primary T cells, and mathematical models indicate that this autonomy results from intrinsic properties of the HIV Tat positive-feedback circuit. However, directly testing circuit autonomy to cell state is confounded by overlap between cellular and viral networks—the same transcription factors that alter cellular activation also activate the HIV LTR, triggering Tat positive feedback (Karn, 2011Karn J. The molecular biology of HIV latency: breaking and restoring the Tat-dependent transcriptional circuit.Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2011; 6: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To circumvent this overlap, we synthetically reconstruct the Tat circuit to decouple viral dependence on the cellular environment from viral transcriptional regulation (i.e., decouple viral sensing and actuation). The refactored circuits chemically modulate viral expression independent of cellular activation levels and show that Tat circuitry is sufficient to overcome cell-driven silencing of HIV transcription during cellular relaxation from active to resting. Overall, the results argue that the Tat circuit is hardwired to establish latency largely autonomous of cellular state. To test the prevailing “epiphenomenon” hypothesis of HIV latency establishment, we αCD3/CD28 pre-activated donor-derived primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes (to achieve a CD25+CD69+ phenotype), infected them with full-length HIV-1 virus, and then removed activation stimuli, allowing infected cells to relax to a resting (CD25−CD69−) state (Figure 2A). The virus used (HIV-d2GFP) encodes a short-lived 2-hr half-life GFP (d2GFP) reporter to enable rapid detection of viral transcriptional silencing and is env mutated (i.e., single-replication round) to avoid confounding the data with expansion of the infected cell population. Infected cells were sampled periodically over 2 weeks for cellular activation status (as quantified by CD25 and CD69) alongside viral-GFP expression. Surprisingly, viral expression appears remarkably robust during the cellular transition from activated to resting (Figures 2B and 2C–2H). Despite drastic decline in cellular activation both in CD25 (Figures 2D and 2G) and in CD69 (Figures 2C and 2F), viral activity (quantified by GFP expression of productively infected cells) remained relatively unchanged (Figures 2B, 2E, and 2H). The resilience of viral gene expression despite cellular relaxation is not due to differential relaxation of productively infected cells compared to the overall population, as productively infected cells relax at the same rate as the overall population (Figure S1). Since human primary cells represent a mixed co-culture (i.e., infected and uninfected subsets of cells), which may obfuscate the interpretation of results (Jordan et al., 2003Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. HIV reproducibly establishes a latent infection after acute infection of T cells in vitro.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), we also performed a refined version of the experiment by isolating HIV-infected cells through FACS sorting and tracking this purified population of infected lymphocytes as cells relaxed to resting (Figure 2I). As before, even after 2 weeks of culture, ∼90% of cells maintain high-level viral expression (Figure 2J) despite cellular relaxation to resting (Figure S1). Collectively, these two experiments show that, despite a 10-fold decline in CD4+ T cell activation levels, the impact on viral gene expression is minimal, suggesting that viral circuitry is largely autonomous to cellular state. To investigate how viral transcription remains robust despite cell-state changes, we employ a simplified computational model of HIV transcriptional regulation (Figure 3A) based on previous studies (Weinberger et al., 2008Weinberger L.S. Dar R.D. Simpson M.L. Transient-mediated fate determination in a transcriptional circuit of HIV.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This model builds off the standard two-state model of transcription (Kepler and Elston, 2001Kepler T.B. Elston T.C.

J. 2001; 81: 3116-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, Paulsson, 2004Paulsson J. Summing up the noise in gene networks.Nature. 2004; 427: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar) and allows the LTR promoter to stochastically toggle between a transcriptionally non-permissive state (LTROFF) and a transcriptionally permissive state (LTRON) at rates koff and kon, respectively. In the LTRON state, Tat protein can transactivate the promoter, enhancing transcriptional elongation at a rate ktransact. These parameters (koff, kon, and ktransact) have been quantified by single-cell analysis (Dar et al., 2012Dar R.D. Razooky B.S. Singh A. Trimeloni T.V. McCollum J.M. Cox C.D. Simpson M.L.

Transient-mediated fate determination in a transcriptional circuit of HIV.Nat.

Potent cell-state activators, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which acts through the same pathway as αCD3/CD28 activation, maximally stimulate LTR activity by increasing kon by 1.5- to 2-fold (Dar et al., 2012Dar R.D.

The site of HIV-1 integration in the human genome determines basal transcriptional activity and response to Tat transactivation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To determine whether relaxation of activated T cells (i.e., decreases in kon) can drive LTR-Tat circuit shutoff and latency, we simulated infection of activated T cells and examined how tuning kon alters the fraction of trajectories in the ON state; i.e., initial conditions were LTRON = 1, and all other molecular species = 0 (see Table S1), thereby allowing efficient Tat turn-on in activated cells with subsequent stochastic circuit shutoff. The simplified model recapitulates previous results showing a phenotypic bifurcation in Tat levels (Weinberger et al., 2005Weinberger L.S. Burnett J.C. Toettcher J.E. Arkin A.P. Schaffer D.V. Stochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 Tat fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.Cell. 2005; 122: 169-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), with a fraction of trajectories remaining ON and a fraction turning OFF (Figure 3B) for any given kon across a broad range of values (Figure 3C). Indeed, for LTR activities within three orders of magnitude (Figure S2), any trajectory can maintain either an ON or OFF state purely by altering the level of Tat without a change in basal LTR activity. Thus, the model predicts that, at a given cellular-activation state (kon value), circuit activity could be toggled ON and OFF simply by supplying Tat alone (e.g., in trans) without activating the LTR or changing the cellular-activation state (e.g., via TNFα). Moreover, the ON fraction can also be altered by changing Tat abundance—and hence feedback strength—through Tat half-life modulation (Figure S2). Next, we directly examined how decreases in kon influenced circuit activity. For all 2-fold decreases in kon (over three orders of magnitude), there is >90% robustness in the percentage of trajectories in the ON state (Figure 3D). 2-fold decreases in LTR activity were examined because removal of cell-state activators (e.g., TNFα), result in 1.5- to 2-fold reductions in LTR activity (Dar et al., 2012Dar R.D. Razooky B.S. Singh A. Trimeloni T.V. McCollum J.M. Cox C.D. Simpson M.L. Weinberger L.S. Transcriptional burst frequency and burst size are equally modulated across the human genome.Proc. Natl. Acad.

The site of HIV-1 integration in the human genome determines basal transcriptional activity and response to Tat transactivation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but comparable circuit robustness was observed for all 4-fold and even 1-Log reductions in kon (Figure S2). In fact, the simplified nature of the computational model allows derivation of an analytical “closed-form” solution for the fraction of ON trajectories as a function of time for all parameters (see Extended Experimental Procedures), thereby enabling phase-plane analysis of the ON fraction as a function of kon and ktransact (Figure S2). This phase-plane sensitivity analysis demonstrates that—throughout the physiological parameter regime of ktransact > kon (Dar et al., 2012Dar R.D. Razooky B.S. Singh A. Trimeloni T.V. McCollum J.M. Cox C.D. Simpson M.L. Weinberger L.S. Transcriptional burst frequency and burst size are equally modulated across the human genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A real-time view of the TAR:Tat:P-TEFb complex at HIV-1 transcription sites.Retrovirology. 2007; 4: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)—even if an infected cell lives far longer than the in vivo lifetime of 40 hr (Perelson et al., 1996Perelson A.S. Neumann A.U. Markowitz M. Leonard J.M. Ho D.D. HIV-1 dynamics in vivo: virion clearance rate, infected cell life-span, and viral generation time.Science. 1996; 271: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar), kon modulation cannot substantially alter the ON fraction. To be completely sure that these results were not a peculiarity of the specific model used, we also examined an alternate positive-feedback model topology (Weinberger et al., 2005Weinberger L.S. Burnett J.C. Toettcher J.E. Arkin A.P. Schaffer D.V. Stochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 Tat fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.Cell. 2005; 122: 169-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar)—which encodes substantially more molecular detail but is experimentally validated—and we observed similar circuit robustness to decreases in kon (Figure S2). Analytical solution shows that this robustness results from the strong positive feedback (ktransact > kon), since changes in kon produce small corrections. Notably, despite the circuit’s robustness to cellular relaxation (kon decreases), high values of kon do generate less-frequent latency in both the simplified model (Figure 3C) and the complex models (Weinberger et al., 2005Weinberger L.S. Burnett J.C. Toettcher J.E. Arkin A.P. Schaffer D.V. Stochastic gene expression in a lentiviral positive-feedback loop: HIV-1 Tat fluctuations drive phenotypic diversity.Cell. 2005; 122: 169-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In fact, the analytical solution quantifies how increases in kon (e.g., via NFκB stimulation) reactivate the circuit from a latent state (Equation 12, Extended Experimental Procedures). Overall, the results demonstrate robustness of LTR-Tat circuit activity to cellular relaxation (i.e., reductions in kon), consistent with primary cell observations (Figure 2), but, critically, also show sensitivity of latency to changes in Tat abundance or changes in Tat half-life. Below, we experimentally test these computational predictions: (1) that LTR-Tat circuit activity between latent and active can be toggled by Tat levels alone (i.e., independent of cellular-activation state), (2) that Tat is more effective at activation from latency than cell-state modifiers, and (3) that cellular relaxation to resting does not silence Tat positive-feedback circuitry. To test whether HIV gene-regulatory circuitry can control proviral latency without changes in cellular-activation state, we developed synthetic circuits in which viral expression could be toggled independent of cell state. The synthetic circuits are based upon a minimal model of the HIV latency circuit and encode a transcriptional positive-feedback loop in which HIV Tat amplifies expression from the HIV LTR promoter (Jordan et al., 2001Jordan A. Defechereux P. Verdin E. The site of HIV-1 integration in the human genome determines basal transcriptional activity and response to Tat transactivation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, Weinberger et al., 2005Weinberger L.S.

The minimal LTR-Tat circuit is sufficient to recapitulate latent gene expression; stimulation with cell-state modifiers reactivates proviral expression from a non-expressive “OFF” state to a high-level “ON” state. The minimalist synthetic toggle circuit encodes Tat fused to a controllable proteolysis tag, FKBP (Banaszynski et al., 2006Banaszynski L.A. Chen L.C. Maynard-Smith L.A. Ooi A.G. Wandless T.J.

FKBP degradation is reversibly inhibited by a small molecule, Shield-1, allowing Tat half-life to be rapidly tuned. The Tat-FKBP fusion was also tagged with a photo-switchable fluorescent protein, Dendra-2 (Gurskaya et al., 2006Gurskaya N.G. Verkhusha V.V. Shcheglov A.S. Staroverov D.B. Chepurnykh T.V.

Simulations predict that changes in Tat half-life should be sufficient to toggle HIV positive feedback between ON and OFF at a majority of viral integration sites (Figure S2). As predicted, altering the Tat half-life by addition or removal of Shield-1 was sufficient to toggle between latent and active expression across an array of integration sites (Figure 4B). The observed reactivation is not due to pleiotropic effects of Shield-1 since Tat-Dendra fusion proteins lacking FKBP are insensitive to Shield-1 (Figure S3). Moreover, the increased expression levels cannot simply be due to an increase in the half-life of the reporter (Dendra-2), as the expression increases are substantially greater than the 3.3-fold increase in half-life caused by Shield-1 (Figure S3).

The four microalgal cultures were harvested during exponential growth, lyophilized, and analysed for proximate composition (moisture, ash, lipid, carbohydrates, and protein), pigments, and amino acid and fatty acid profiles. The resulting nutritional value, based on biochemical composition, was compared to commercial Spirulina and Chlorella products. The Australian native microalgae exhibited similar, and in several cases superior, organic nutritional properties relative to the assessed commercial products, with biochemical profiles rich in high-quality protein, nutritious polyunsaturated fats (such as α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid), and antioxidant pigments. These findings indicate that the microalgae assessed have great potential as multi-nutrient human health supplements."

The T6SS is composed of a sheath and a tube anchored to the bacterial envelope by a baseplate (Ho et al., 2014Ho B.T. Dong T.G. Mekalanos J.J.

Instead of a single sheath protein in phage tails and pyocins, the T6SS sheath is composed of two proteins, VipA/VipB in Vibrio, which are orthologs of IglA/IglB of F. tularensis (Bröms et al., 2009Bröms J.E.

However, the atomic structure of the T6SS and molecular interactions required for secretion are not known. Although the structure of Vibrio VipA/VipB outer sheath has recently been shown at 6 Å resolution (Kube et al., 2014Kube S. Kapitein N. Zimniak T. Herzog F. Mogk A. Wendler P. Structure of the VipA/B type VI secretion complex suggests a contraction-state-specific recycling mechanism.Cell Rep. 2014; 8: 20-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), that structure is insufficient to guide drug design and mutagenesis studies. Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes a zoonotic infection, tularemia, in animals and humans (Ellis et al., 2002Ellis J. Oyston P.C. Green M. Titball R.W. Tularemia.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 631-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). By the airborne route, a few organisms can cause lethal pneumonia in humans; hence, F. tularensis is a potential agent of bioterrorism and classified as a Tier 1 Select Agent. F. tularensis and the highly related F. tularensis subsp. novicida are facultative intracellular pathogens that replicate within macrophages. After uptake by macrophages via looping phagocytosis (Clemens et al., 2005Clemens D.L. Lee B.Y. Horwitz M.A. Francisella tularensis enters macrophages via a novel process involving pseudopod loops.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5892-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Clemens et al., 2012Clemens D.L. Lee B.Y.

Immun. 2012; 80: 952-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the bacteria initially reside within a fibrillar-coated membrane-bound phagosome that resists fusion with lysosomes and exhibits limited acquisition of lysosomal markers; however, the bacteria subsequently disrupt their phagosomal membrane and replicate extensively in the host cell cytosol (Chong and Celli, 2010Chong A. Celli J. The francisella intracellular life cycle: toward molecular mechanisms of intracellular survival and proliferation.Front Microbiol. 2010; 1: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Clemens and Horwitz, 2007Clemens D.L.

Immun. 2004; 72: 3204-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). F. novicida has considerable homology with F. tularensis, but it has only a single copy of the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI), and it is of low virulence for humans; it thus serves as a more practicable subspecies for study. Here, we show that the FPI of F. novicida encodes a T6SS, and, by cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), that the two proteins of its sheath, IglA and IglB, are interdigitated into a single fold similar to that of the phage sheath. CryoEM reconstruction at 3.7 Å reveals that β sheet augmentation interlaces the two-dimensional array of the sheath, and structure-based mutagenesis demonstrates that this interlacing is essential to secretion. To facilitate structural and functional studies of the FPI-encoded T6SS-like apparatus, we engineered F. novicida to express IglA-GFP fusion protein in lieu of IglA from its chromosome (Fn-IglA-GFP). These bacteria show only a weak diffuse fluorescence when grown in standard liquid culture medium. However, within 15 min of uptake by macrophages, 10% of the bacteria exhibit intensely fluorescent foci (Figures 1C and 1E), and this percentage increases to ∼70% by 1 day after uptake, by which time the bacteria have proliferated extensively in the macrophage cytosol (Figures 1D–1F). We used a split-GFP system (Cabantous and Waldo, 2006Cabantous S. Waldo G.S. In vivo and in vitro protein solubility assays using split GFP.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), with domains 1–10 of GFP fused to the C terminus of IglA and domain 11 of GFP fused to the N terminus of IglB (IglA-GFP1-10 and IglB-GFP11) to test the interaction of IglA and IglB in formation of fluorescent foci. These bacteria are not fluorescent when grown in broth culture but exhibit intense GFP fluorescent foci after uptake and replication within macrophages (Figures 1G and 1H). In contrast, F. novicida expressing IglA-GFP1-10/SodB-GFP11 (Figure 1I) and F. novicida expressing IglA-GFP1-10 without a GFP11 partner (Figure 1J) do not form green fluorescent structures, despite their capacity to replicate extensively within macrophages (Figure 1K). Western blotting confirmed expression pattern of IglA/B-split GFP constructs (Figure 1L). Because FPI mutants are unable to permeabilize their vacuoles, formation of the IglA/IglB containing T6SS and secretion of its effectors is believed to precede and to be required for phagosome disruption and cytosolic escape by Francisella. The extremely high expression at late stages of infection suggests that the FPI-encoded T6SS is required for events after phagosome permeabilization. Consistent with this, (1) most FPI genes are induced during intramacrophage growth and show high levels of expression at late time points after bacterial uptake (Golovliov et al., 1997Golovliov I. Ericsson M. Sandström G. Tärnvik A. Sjöstedt A.

Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1128-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), when most bacteria are cytosolic, and (2) we have observed that IglC is required for intracellular growth of F. novicida that are micro-injected directly into the cytosol of HeLa cells. In addition to intracellular growth in macrophages, two other conditions induce formation of fluorescent structures within Fn-IglA-GFP or Fn-IglA/B-split GFP: (1) placement beneath coverslips (either sealed by silicone or not) at room temperature for more than 3 hr (Figures 2A–2E) and (2) growth in broth containing 5% KCl (but not 5% NaCl) (Figures 2F–2J). The fluorescent foci do not form in Fn-IglA-GFP with a deletion of iglB in response to any of the above three conditions (Figure S1), suggesting that IglB subunits are required for assembly of the T6SS-like structure. The stimulus for assembly of fluorescent foci provided by placement beneath coverslips is unclear but could include physical stimulation, modulation of oxygen tension, or other environmental conditions. The fluorescent foci form with similar kinetics by bacteria sandwiched between a polystyrene surface and glass coverslip or between two glass surfaces but form more slowly when the glass slide is replaced with a 25 μm gas-permeable Lumox (Starstedt) film base, consistent with a role for oxygen tension.Figure S1IgIB Is Required for Formation of Green Fluorescent Foci, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–C) Unlike F. novicida expressing IglA/B-split GFP, Fn-IglA-GFP ΔiglB exhibit a diffuse green fluorescence without formation of focal intense green fluorescent structures (A) in macrophages, (B) in broth culture with 5% KCl, or (C) under coverslips.(A) THP-1 cells one day after infection with either Fn-IglA-GFP ΔiglB (top panels) or Fn-IglA/B-split GFP (bottom panels).

The slower turnover of the F. novicida T6SS may reflect the absence of an identifiable protein in the F. tularensis genome to disassemble the T6SS. Although the F. novicida genome lacks a protein with homology to ClpV, we cannot rule out the possibility of a protein with no such sequence homology that fulfills this role. However, F. novicida IglB, a VipB homolog, lacks the latter’s identified ClpV-interacting motif (Pietrosiuk et al., 2011Pietrosiuk A. Lenherr E.D. Falk S. Bönemann G. Kopp J. Zentgraf H. Sinning I. Mogk A. Molecular basis for the unique role of the AAA+ chaperone ClpV in type VI protein secretion.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30010-30021Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar): an α-helical region at the N terminus of VipB (including a consensus sequence LLDEIM, residues 19–24 of VipB). Indeed, Protein-Protein BLAST analysis indicates that the N-terminal 56 amino acids of VipB have no sequence homology with any region of IglB, and the N terminus of F. novicida IglB has no similar α-helical region or consensus sequence. The GFP tags on IglA and IglB are not likely to hamper their interaction with any disassembling chaperone because (1) we observe the same slow turnover for both F. novicida expressing IglA-GFP (GFP fused to the C terminus of IglA) and F. novicida expressing the split GFP construct (IglA with GFP domains 1–10 fused to its C terminus and IglB with GFP domain 11 fused to its N terminus), and (2) for V. cholerae, rapid turnover was observed even for VipA-GFP (C-terminal fusion), indicating that the corresponding VipA-GFP fusion in V. cholerae does not prevent rapid ClpV-mediated disassembly. If F. novicida has a functional homolog of ClpV, then its interactions with the T6SS sheath are likely to differ markedly from those in V. cholerae. Secretion of VgrG by F. novicida has been reported previously (Barker et al., 2009Barker J.R. Chong A. Wehrly T.D. Yu J.J. Rodriguez S.A. Liu J. Celli J. Arulanandam B.P. Klose K.E.

Microbiol. 2009; 74: 1459-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We prepared FLAG-tagged VgrG and grew the bacteria in the presence or absence of KCl. FLAG-VgrG and IglC are both detected in the culture supernatant in the presence, but not in the absence, of KCl (Figure 2K). Deletion of iglA abolishes the release of VgrG and IglC into the culture medium (Figure 2K). We purified assemblies containing IglA-GFP or IglA from lysates of bacteria grown in trypticase soy broth supplemented with 0.2% L-cysteine (TSBC) in the presence of KCl. Both proteins sedimented in equilibrium to below 55% sucrose on sucrose gradients. Negatively stained TEM images of the fraction containing IglA-GFP or IglA showed rod-shaped particles of variable length, similar to Vibrio cholerae T6SS sheaths with or without GFP tag (Basler et al., 2012Basler M.

The sheath is constructed with discs of six heterodimers of IglA/IglB proteins (Figure 3D and Movie S2). The validity of the map and the model is demonstrated by the deep grooves in α helices, well-separated β strands, and match of side chains in the sequence and in the density map (Figures 3E and 3F). The asymmetric unit of the helical sheath contains one copy each of IglA and IglB. The folds of the IglA/IglB proteins can be thought of as a “split” of the single protein of a bacteriophage sheath with many insertions (Figures 4A–4D and Movie S3). Joining together, these two proteins form an α-β-α sandwich. The central β sheet of this sandwich is formed by interdigitation of strands from both IglA and IglB (Figure 4E). The sheath fold splits between its first and second α helices, and each of the two ends of the split is appended with an insertion (box in Figure 4D). Parts of these two insertions are disordered (C-terminal amino acids 136–184 of IglA and N-terminal amino acids 2–78 of IglB [question marks in Figure 4D]). The domain near the C terminus of IgIB (cyan in Figures 4C and 4D) highly resembles the C-terminal domain of the phage sheath proteins (Aksyuk et al., 2009Aksyuk A.A. Leiman P.G. Kurochkina L.P.

The secondary structure and tertiary structural arrangement of the F. novicida T6SS sheath are similar, but not identical, to those of the bacteriophage T4 sheath (Fokine et al., 2013Fokine A.

Biol. 2013; 425: 1731-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The central β sheet of the F. novicida T6SS is formed by interdigitating two proteins (Figure 4E). Notably, phage T4 sheath protein has an insertion of two domains before a long helix (Figures 4C and 4F, see lower right schematic, and Movie S3), whereas in T6SS sheath, this long helix is broken into two shorter helices, its third and fourth helices from its N terminus. In the case of F. novicida, the third helix tilts up and is almost perpendicular to the fourth helix (Figure 4F, dashed lines in ribbon diagram, and upper right schematic). In stark contrast, the quaternary structural organization of the T6SS sheath is markedly different from that of the post-contraction T4 (Leiman et al., 2004Leiman P.G. Chipman P.R. Kostyuchenko V.A. Mesyanzhinov V.V. Rossmann M.G.

The helix with the shortest, non-zero pitch (a six-start helix, black dashed line in Figures 4G or 4H) in the T6SS sheath has a left-handed turn of 33.4° (Figure S3D) and a rise of 20.8 Å per subunit (whereas the T4 sheath has a right-handed turn of 32.9°); thus the two helical architectures mirror each other. Despite opposite handedness, layer lines in the Fourier spectra of the EM images (Figure S4) indicate that the other parameters of the helical symmetry of the F. novicida T6SS sheath and the post-contraction T4 sheath are similar, suggesting that this T6SS sheath structure is in its post-contraction state.Figure S4Layer Lines Demonstrate Similarities of Helical Parameters of T6SS and Bacteriophage T4, Related to Figure 4Show full captionThe Fourier spectra of TEM images of F. novicida T6SS (A) and the projection image of bacteriophage T4 sheath (taken from EMDB-1086) (B) are shown with layer lines labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Fourier spectra of TEM images of F. novicida T6SS (A) and the projection image of bacteriophage T4 sheath (taken from EMDB-1086) (B) are shown with layer lines labeled. The two-stranded β sheet of the C-terminal domain of IglB is augmented on one side by arms that emanate from the two neighboring IglA/IglB dimers from a disc above (Figures 5A–5C, S3B, and S3C), forming a four-stranded sheet. By this augmentation, the arms from hundreds of copies of IglA/IglB interlace a two-dimensional array (Figures S3A and S3C). We hypothesized that this two-dimensional interlacing is crucial to the integrity and thus the contractility and secretory capacity of the F. novicida T6SS. To test this hypothesis, we carried out structure-based mutagenesis experiments for residues centered on the augmented β sheet. We prepared IglA/B-split GFP mutant strains lacking either N-terminal amino acids 2–18 of IglA (Fn-IglAΔ18N/B-split GFP) or the last 25 amino acids at the C-terminal of IglB (Fn-IglA/BΔ25C-split GFP). We predicted that both mutant strains would show normal assembly of their pre-contraction T6SS organelles but that the T6SS sheath would become unstable with attempted contraction and thus fail to secrete effector proteins. Indeed, both the IglA and IglB truncation mutants expressing the truncated IglA/B with the split GFP tags formed fluorescent foci in response to 5% KCl or incubation beneath coverslips (Figures 5D–5M), indicating focal multimerization of the IglA/B-heterodimers. However, the mutants were completely defective in secretion of IglC (Figure 5N) and had markedly impaired growth in THP-1 macrophage-like cells, with growth kinetics similar to iglB and iglC deletion mutants (Figure 5O). Like the iglB and iglC deletion mutants, the Fn-IglAΔ18N/B- and Fn-IglA/BΔ25C-split GFP mutants remain within compartments that stain positive for the lysosomal marker CD63 (Figure 6A) and are u"

Telomeres, protective DNA-protein complexes at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, buffer against the loss of sequence during DNA replication and distinguish normal chromosome ends from potentially dangerous double-strand breaks. Telomeres are composed of sequence-specific DNA binding proteins bound to highly repetitive DNA sequences and are increasingly recognized as genomic regions prone to replication stress (Miller et al., 2006Miller K.M.

Without the telomeric DNA-elongating enzyme telomerase, progressive telomere shortening eventually causes the collapse of the protective DNA-protein complex (deprotection), but this occurs only after many cell divisions, late after telomerase inactivation (LTI). In LTI cells, telomere deprotection shares many properties with classic DNA damage (Nautiyal et al., 2002Nautiyal S. DeRisi J.L. Blackburn E.H.

Previously, responses to telomerase deletion have generally been reported only after a significant delay (in S. cerevisiae, after ∼50–80 divisions). Thus, it was thought that cells sense altered telomere properties that signal senescence only when telomeres become critically short and deprotected. Hence, responses and phenotypes of cells early after telomerase inactivation (ETI) have not been extensively investigated. However, it was previously shown that, in ETI cells, very short telomeres appear at low frequencies that fuse to an induced double-strand break (DSB) (∼10−4 to 10−3). These rare fusions became molecularly detectable when telomerase was inactivated by either deletion of the telomerase RNA template TLC1 (tlc1Δ) or by replacing the reverse transcriptase subunit, EST2, with the mutant est2-D530A, which assembles a telomerase ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex lacking telomeric DNA polymerization activity (Chan and Blackburn, 2003Chan S.W.

Reverse transcriptase motifs in the catalytic subunit of telomerase.Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). These fusogenic telomeres arose in ETI cells well before any signs of bulk population senescence and even if the telomeres had been pre-lengthened. Therefore, even the short-term absence of telomerase activity causes cells to experience a low but detectable genomic instability. In a process distinct from the permanent bulk population cell-cycle arrest resulting from critically short telomeres in senescent LTI cells, an individual wild-type (WT) yeast mother cell will cease divisions after it has produced ∼25 daughter cells. As of yet, there has been very little evidence suggesting interaction between the pathways that regulate these two kinds of aging, hereafter referred to as “LTI senescence” and “mother cell aging/lifespan,” respectively. Despite the identification of multiple genes that regulate mother cells lifespans (Bishop and Guarente, 2007Bishop N.A. Guarente L.

Lessons on longevity from budding yeast.Nature. 2010; 464: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), the mechanisms causing mother cell aging of even WT yeast remain poorly understood. Here, we report experiments employing single cell methodologies, supporting a model in which budding yeast mother cells lacking telomerase activity are less able to resolve replication stress inherent to telomeres. These cells show induction of a signaling pathway indicative of transient DNA replication stress, altered cell-cycle dynamics even in young mother cells, and accelerated aging (reduced lifespan), independently of telomere length. Our results demonstrate that this occurs well before the onset of LTI senescence and that the accelerated aging of ETI mother cells resembles the normal mother cell aging process. We analyzed the properties of individual haploid ETI mother cells, well before any signs of cellular LTI senescence, freshly isolated from sporulation of heterozygous telomerase-competent diploids. Following genotyping, cells were taken from logarithmically growing cell cultures (∼25–30 generations after telomerase loss), in which the overwhelming majority of cells were robustly growing newborn or very young mother cells. These cells were placed in a microfluidic device, and the budding cycles and lifespans of individual mother cells were continuously monitored for 2 days by repeated microscopic imaging (Xie et al., 2012Xie Z. Zhang Y. Zou K. Brandman O. Luo C. Ouyang Q. Li H.

Single cell analysis of yeast replicative aging using a new generation of microfluidic device.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e48275Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). First, even the youngest ETI mother cells (tlc1Δ or est2-D530A) immediately showed higher frequencies of stochastically longer and more heterogeneous cell-cycle durations than WT (Figures 1A–1C; note especially between times 0 to 5 hr, as marked on Y axes). As the durations of the last two budding cycles were highly heterogeneous in both WT and ETI mothers, they were discarded from all cell-cycle duration analyses discussed here. This cell-cycle heterogeneity was consistent with observations of bulk ETI population budding kinetics, as manifested by cells lingering in the large-budded state (G2/M), enriched for cells with short spindles and unsegregated chromosomes (Figures S1A–S1C). Second, we analyzed the mother cell aging of individual ETI cells and found that the lack of telomerase activity reduced ETI mother cell lifespan. Mean budding lifespan for tlc1Δ was 12.6 (7 replicates) and 7.6 generations for est2-D530A (3 replicates), compared to 22.1 for WT mother cells (Figures 1A–1C and 1E). Furthermore, the catalytically inactive telomerase est2-D530A point mutant showed even longer cell-cycle durations than tlc1Δ ETI mother cells, and the lifespan reduction was even more severe. Hence, lack of telomerase enzymatic activity, rather than the absence of an assembled telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, causes increased cell-cycle heterogeneity and faster mother cell aging.Figure S1ETI Induces a Transient G2/M Pause in Bulk Population Time-Course Experiments, Related to Figure 1Show full captionBulk population time-course experiments to measure cell-cycle progression, spindle length and chromosome segregation in synchronized yeast cultures of WT or ETI (tlc1Δ) cells.

Error bars indicate SD. If the extended, heterogeneous cell-cycle lengths of ETI mother cells were due solely to telomere shortening, we would have expected the phenotype to worsen progressively with each successive cell division. However, this was not the case. First, as individual mother cells progressed from being very young to old, ETI mother cells did not show any significant progressive increase in mean duration or heterogeneity of mother cell-cycle lengths relative to WT (Figure 1G). Second, during the individual ETI mother cell lineages, a young mother cell whose initial cell cycle was long had no greater probability of having subsequent longer cell cycles or a shorter lifespan than one with an initial short cell cycle (Figure S2), supporting a stochastic and episodic, rather than progressive, nature of the occurrence of longer cell cycles. These highly stochastic episodes of cell-cycle heterogeneity and lack of any progressive worsening of this phenotype as ETI mother cells aged are not the predicted result of progressive telomere shortening. Because we observed an extended G2/M phase in bulk population analyses (Figure S1), which is often the result of DDR activation, we determined whether mutations affecting the DDR affected the above ETI phenotypes. Responses to various forms of DNA damage, including that sensed at critically short telomeres in LTI senescence, involve a cascade of phosphorylation events, with early upstream steps occurring at the source of DNA damage through PIKK family member kinases Mec1 (ATR) and/or Tel1 (ATM). Strains lacking only Mec1 are inviable, but this mec1Δ lethality can be rescued by deletion of SML1 (Zhao et al., 1998Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. A suppressor of two essential checkpoint genes identifies a novel protein that negatively affects dNTP pools.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Sml1 inhibits ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in dNTP production (Reichard, 1988Reichard P. Interactions between deoxyribonucleotide and DNA synthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Deletion of Sml1 increases RNR activity and elevates dNTP pools, obviating the need for certain DDR components under healthy growing conditions, and can be protective against some forms of DNA damage (Andreson et al., 2010Andreson B.L. Gupta A. Georgieva B.P. Rothstein R.

Bermejo R. The DNA damage checkpoint response to replication stress: A Game of Forks.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Strikingly, deletion of SML1 in ETI tlc1Δ strains efficiently rescued the ETI-induced heterogeneity of budding cycle durations (Figure 1D) as well as the shortening of mother cell lifespan (Figure 1F). However, SML1 deletion alone produced no change in the rates of bulk telomere shortening in ETI cells, nor in the subsequent onset of LTI senescence (Figures 2 and S3). We also confirmed that the deletion of SML1 alone caused no significant effect on mother cell lifespans and telomere length compared to WT (Figures 1F and S4B). Hence, the dramatic rescue of ETI cell-cycle heterogeneity and accelerated mother cell aging by SML1 deletion cannot be explained by increased telomere length or by slower rates of telomere shortening.Figure S3SML1 Deletion Does Not Alter the Kinetics of Telomere Shortening or Onset of Senescence Caused by est2-D530A, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe experiment was performed and analyzed as in Figure 2.

We tested further whether budding cessation due to mother cell aging in ETI or WT cells was distinguishable from the G2/M arrest caused by LTI senescence by examining cell and mitochondrial morphology at the end of the lifespans (terminal morphology). Typical WT mother cell aging produces terminal cells that are mostly small budded with minimal or no mitochondrial fluorescence signal from a mitochondrially localized GFP (mtGFP) (Figure 3Ai) and a smaller population of elongated cells with brighter mitochondrial fluorescence (Figure 3Aii). In contrast, cells terminally arrested due to LTI senescence accumulate with a swollen, large-budded (“dumbbell”) morphology and with mitochondrial fluorescence that gradually forms very bright dots (Figure 3Aiii) (Nautiyal et al., 2002Nautiyal S. DeRisi J.L. Blackburn E.H. The genome-wide expression response to telomerase deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9316-9321Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We created and analyzed two populations of tlc1Δsml1Δ cells. The first population was isolated as soon as possible after genotyping (ETI) and was enriched for mother cells that would reach their aging limit prior to LTI senescence. The second population was passaged for approximately ten additional generations prior to microfluidics analysis, thus enriching for cells that would undergo LTI senescence (critically short telomeres) before the mother cells reached their aging limit (Figure 3B). Terminally aged ETI tlc1Δ and ETI tlc1Δsml1Δ mother cells accumulated mostly in two dominant terminal morphologies, which resembled the two dominant WT terminal morphology phenotypes (Xie et al., 2012Xie Z. Zhang Y. Zou K. Brandman O. Luo C. Ouyang Q. Li H. Molecular phenotyping of aging in single yeast cells using a novel microfluidic device.Aging Cell. 2012; 11: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and only very rarely in the dumbbell morphology (Figures 3A and 3C). In contrast, in terminal LTI tlc1Δsml1Δ mother cells, terminal dumbbell morphologies became the major type observed, indicating that a large proportion of the population had entered LTI senescence (Figures 3Aiii and 3C). These results support terminal cellular and mitochondrial morphology as an accurate distinction between LTI senescence and normal mother cell aging and provide further evidence that ETI mother cells cease divisions as a result of mother cell aging rather than LTI senescence. We investigated other proteins previously implicated in yeast telomere maintenance and in the DDR for effects on mother cell aging. Maintenance of yeast telomeres at normal length requires DDR kinases Mec1 and Tel1 (Sabourin and Zakian, 2008Sabourin M. Zakian V.A.

The tel1Δ cells used here were isolated immediately after sporulation of heterozygous parent diploids and analyzed when telomeres were still shortening from near-WT lengths. Therefore, having telomeres that are shortening but eventually stably maintained is not alone sufficient to alter cell-cycle duration and lifespan.Figure S5Mother Cell Lifespans of Selected DDR Mutants, Related to Figures 4 and 5Show full caption(A) mec1Δsml1Δ (n = 33) lifespan is not different from WT.

ETI tlc1Δrad9Δ (n = 81) lifespan was no worse than ETI tlc1Δ (n = 78) lifespan (mean, 16.5 and 13.7 respectively) and showed a minor improvement. Next, we examined how mutations of Mec1 and Tel1 affect the ETI phenotypes. Because sml1Δ, as shown above, efficiently rescues the accelerated aging of ETI mother cells, it is difficult to determine whether Mec1 has a role in this process, due to the necessity of deleting SML1 for viability in mec1Δ strains. However, ETI tlc1Δtel1Δ double-mutant mother cells had even greater cell-cycle heterogeneity and shorter budding lifespan (mean 9.8 generations, 2 replicates) than control ETI tlc1Δ single-mutant mother cells (Figures 1B, 4B, and 4D). As shown previously, freshly isolated ETI haploid cells that are also mutated for Tel1 or Mec1 (tlc1Δmec1Δsml1Δ or tlc1Δtel1Δ) have a rate of initial telomere shortening and progression to LTI population senescence similar to tlc1Δ single mutants (Chan and Blackburn, 2003Chan S.W. Blackburn E.H. Telomerase and ATM/Tel1p protect telomeres from nonhomologous end joining.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1379-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Figures 4E and 4F). Hence, the exacerbation of the ETI cell-cycle heterogeneity and lifespan reduction phenotypes caused by lack of Tel1 is not explained by faster telomere shortening or accelerated population senescence. Because sml1Δ rescues the cell-cycle and lifespan phenotypes of tlc1Δ mother cells and is known to facilitate DNA replication by increasing nucleotide levels (Chabes et al., 2003Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Survival of DNA damage in yeast directly depends on increased dNTP levels allowed by relaxed feedback inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase.Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we suspected that ETI cells may be more vulnerable to telomeric DNA replication stress. Therefore, we mutated the DDR adaptor protein Mrc1, which is required specifically for the DNA replication stress checkpoint (Alcasabas et al., 2001Alcasabas A.A. Osborn A.J. Bachant J. Hu F. Werler P.J.H. Bousset K. Furuya K. Diffley J.F.X. Carr A.M. Elledge S.J. Mrc1 transduces signals of DNA replication stress to activate Rad53.Nat.

Mrc1 is a replication fork component whose phosphorylation in response to DNA replication stress activates Rad53.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and has a minor role in telomere length maintenance (Tsolou and Lydall, 2007Tsolou A. Lydall D. Mrc1 protects uncapped budding yeast telomeres from exonuclease EXO1.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of 17 potential PIKK family kinase consensus phosphorylation sites on Mrc1 (mrc1AQ) allows full cell viability but disables the DNA replication stress response (Osborn and Elledge, 2003Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Mrc1 is a replication fork component whose phosphorylation in response to DNA replication stress activates Rad53.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1755-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of any mother cell lifespan or cell-cycle effect of mrc1AQ alone (Figures 5A and 5C ), tlc1Δmrc1AQ double-mutant ETI mother cells showed even greater cell-cycle length heterogeneity than the tlc1Δ single-mutant ETI cells (Figure 5B). Consistent results were also seen in the G2/M durations in bulk populations (Figure S1D), and mean lifespan was markedly reduced to 8.8 generations (2 replicates), compared with 12.6 generations for the control tlc1Δ ETI strains (Figures 1B and 5D).

The filovirus family includes Marburg virus and five ebolaviruses (Ebola, Sudan, Reston, Bundibugyo, and Taï Forest viruses), most of which cause highly lethal hemorrhagic fever and multiple outbreaks among humans. Among the filoviruses, Marburg virus was the first to be identified when it sickened laboratory workers in Europe in 1967 (Malherbe and Strickland-Cholmley, 1968Malherbe H. Strickland-Cholmley M.

Ebola virus is typically found in Central Africa, but re-emerged in Western Africa in 2014 to cause an outbreak unprecedented in magnitude and geographic spread (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014WHO Ebola Response TeamEbola Virus Disease in West Africa - The First 9 Months of the Epidemic and Forward Projections.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1481-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). During this outbreak, an experimental Ebola virus-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail (Qiu et al., 2014Qiu X. Wong G. Audet J. Bello A. Fernando L. Alimonti J.B. Fausther-Bovendo H. Wei H. Aviles J. Hiatt E. et al.Reversion of advanced Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates with ZMapp.Nature. 2014; 514: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) was used compassionately in several patients. No such treatment yet exists that could be used against Marburg virus or the other four ebolaviruses. Filoviruses express a single protein on their envelope surface, a glycoprotein termed GP, which is responsible for attachment to, and entry of, host cells (Sanchez et al., 1996Sanchez A. Trappier S.G. Mahy B.W. Peters C.J. Nichol S.T. The virion glycoproteins of Ebola viruses are encoded in two reading frames and are expressed through transcriptional editing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 3602-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). GP forms a trimer on the viral surface. In the trimer, each monomer is comprised of GP1 and GP2 subunits that are anchored together by a GP1-GP2 disulfide bond (Volchkov et al., 1998Volchkov V.E. Feldmann H. Volchkova V.A. Klenk H.D. Processing of the Ebola virus glycoprotein by the proprotein convertase furin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). GP1 contains a receptor-binding core topped by a glycan cap and a heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), while GP2 contains two heptad repeats and a transmembrane domain. Filoviruses initially enter cells via macropinocytosis (Aleksandrowicz et al., 2011Aleksandrowicz P. Marzi A. Biedenkopf N. Beimforde N. Becker S. Hoenen T. Feldmann H. Schnittler H.J.

MAbs can be produced on large scale and offer more reproducible effects than polyclonal sera from survivors. However, most mAbs available only recognize Ebola virus. Very few are yet described against Marburg virus, and no antibodies are yet described that cross-react among the filoviruses. Indeed, Marburg and Ebola GP are 72% different in protein sequence, and the filoviruses are thought to be antigenically distinct. Further, there is no structure available for the unique Marburg virus GP, by which we may interpret differences in requirements for viral entry, or develop immunotherapeutics or inhibitors of entry. Here, we report the crystal structure of the trimeric, receptor-competent form of Marburg virus GP in complex with a neutralizing antibody, termed MR78, that was identified in a recent human survivor of Marburg virus infection (Flyak et al., 2015Flyak A.I. Ilinykh P.A. Murin C.D. Garron T. Shen X. Fusco M.L. Hashiguchi T. Bornholdt Z.A. Slaughter J.C. Sapparapu G. et al.Mechanism of Human Antibody-Mediated Neutralization of Marburg virus.Cell. 2015; 160 (this issue): 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Atypically, MR78 cross-reacts to cleaved Ebola virus GP. An additional structure of MR78 in complex with Ebola virus GP illustrates the basis of the cross-reactivity: the antibody binds a hydrophobic “trough” at the top of GP1, the sequence and structure of which are conserved across the filoviruses. We propose that this trough is the binding site of the critical domain C of the NPC1 receptor. Indeed, MR78 blocks binding of domain C to Marburg GP. Further, the extended third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain (CDR H3) of MR78 mimics the glycan cap that shields this site on Ebola virus prior to entry and may mimic the receptor itself. These crystal structures plus additional biophysical analysis of complete, mucin-containing Ebola and Marburg GP ectodomains reveal that the receptor-binding site is masked on the surface of Ebola virus but more exposed on the surface of Marburg virus. These findings may explain why a cross-reactive antibody such as MR78 has not been identified in studies of Ebola virus. Trimeric GP ectodomains for Marburg virus (MARV; strain Ravn) or Ebola virus (EBOV, also known as Ebola Zaire; strain Mayinga) were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, with or without their mucin-like domains (GP and GPΔmuc, respectively). MARV and EBOV GPΔmuc were further proteolyzed by trypsin or thermolysin, respectively, to produce cleaved GP (GPcl) resembling the version of GP competent for receptor binding in the endosome (Figure S1A). Three hundred versions of MARV GP were engineered and complexed with 22 different mAbs in order to find a crystallizable combination. Hundreds of crystals of the final MARV GPcl-MR78 combination were grown and screened for X-ray diffraction: just one crystal yielded suitable diffraction. Diffraction to 3.6 Å resolution was obtained from a single crystal of the MARV GPcl-Fab MR78 complex. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using EBOV GP and Fab KZ52 (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) as search models and was refined to Rwork of 24.7 % and Rfree of 27.9 % (Table S1). Four GP-Fab complexes are contained in the asymmetric unit: one complete trimer and one other monomer, which forms its biologically relevant trimer around a crystallographic 3-fold axis. Although the overall organization is similar between Marburg and Ebola GPs (1.8 Å rmsd among 212 Cα atoms) (Figures 1A and 1B ), several structural differences exist that may explain their differing requirements for cellular entry. The first difference is that the intra-GP1 disulfide bond formed by C121 and C147 in ebolavirus GP structures (Ebola [Lee et al., 2008Lee J.E. Fusco M.L. Hessell A.J. Oswald W.B. Burton D.R.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar]) does not exist in MARV. In MARV, the two cysteines are replaced instead with L105 and H131 (Figure 1C and Figure S1B). As a result, the equivalent polypeptides, which form the crest of the receptor-binding subunit, differ in structure and flexibility. In the ebolaviruses, the polypeptide bearing C147 (residues 145 to 150) turns inward, toward the trimer center to disulfide bond to C121. In MARV, the equivalent polypeptide (residues 129 to 134) turns outward into solvent, away from the trimer center. A second difference between MARV and the ebolaviruses lies at the base of the cathepsin cleavage loop. In MARV, these residues (172-180) form a clear alpha helix (α2), which packs against the outside of the GP2 fusion loop, interacting with both the N- and C-terminal strands of the fusion loop (Figure 1D). In ebolaviruses, the equivalent residues predict to form a loop rather than a helix and are disordered (Bale et al., 2012Bale S. Dias J.M. Fusco M.L. Hashiguchi T. Wong A.C. Liu T. Keuhne A.I. Li S. Woods Jr., V.L. Chandran K. et al.Structural basis for differential neutralization of ebolaviruses.Viruses. 2012; 4: 447-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Dias et al., 2011Dias J.M.

Structure of the Ebola virus glycoprotein bound to an antibody from a human survivor.Nature. 2008; 454: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In MARV GP, the peptide connecting this α2 helix to β14 in the glycan cap would necessarily and immediately cover the both N- and C-terminal arms of the GP2 fusion loop, and if uncleaved, would hinder the conformational changes of fusion. Structural differences in α2 of MARV may prevent effective processing by cathepsin B. The third difference in the MARV GP structure lies at the N terminus, in the base of the β sheet that forms the GP1 spool, about which the metastable GP2 subunit is wound. In EBOV, the base of the spool connects to the anchoring GP1-GP2 disulfide bond by a short stretch of polypeptide that intimately interacts with GP2. This short connecting polypeptide contains an N-linked glycan at Asn40, and also contains residue Asp47, which renders EBOV dependent on cathepsin B for entry (Misasi et al., 2012Misasi J. Chandran K. Yang J.Y. Considine B. Filone C.M. Côté M. Sullivan N. Fabozzi G. Hensley L. Cunningham J. Filoviruses require endosomal cysteine proteases for entry but exhibit distinct protease preferences.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In EBOV entry, cathepsin B removes an additional and critical 1 kDa of mass from GP beyond that removed by cathepsin L, but the site and consequences of that extra cleavage event are not yet known. We propose that if cathepsin B cleaves this connecting loop, EBOV GP2 would be freed from the constraints of the disulfide bond and better able to undergo the conformational rearrangements of fusion. Our crystal structure reveals that MARV, which is cathepsin B-independent, is structured differently from EBOV at the same site. In MARV, the base of the GP1 spool is more mobile and is shifted toward the center of the trimer, inside of the fusion loop. Further, unlike in ebolaviruses (Dias et al., 2011Dias J.M. Kuehne A.I. Abelson D.M. Bale S. Wong A.C. Halfmann P. Muhammad M.A. Fusco M.L. Zak S.E. Kang E. et al.A shared structural solution for neutralizing ebolaviruses.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chandran K. et al.Structural basis for differential neutralization of ebolaviruses.Viruses. 2012; 4: 447-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the polypeptide connection to the MARV GP1-GP2 disulfide could not be visualized and the N-linked glycan is absent. The nearest glycan is instead attached to residue 171 on the MARV GP1 β sheet itself (Figure 1E). These differences in sequence, glycosylation, mobility, and conformation likely allow MARV to be cleaved by other enzymes and render MARV cathepsin B-independent. The crystal structure of MARV GPcl in complex with the Fab fragment of MR78 indicates that MR78 binds the membrane-distal head of GP1 (Figure 2A). We determined an additional, low-resolution structure of EBOV GPcl bound to both MR78 and KZ52. The ternary EBOV complex, determined by molecular replacement, demonstrates that the MR78 antibody recognizes a similar site on both MARV and EBOV (Figures 2B, S2, and Table S1). MR78 binds into a highly conserved hydrophobic trough revealed at the top of the EBOV GP1 core, after removal of the glycan cap by proteolytic cleavage in the endosome. Although MARV and EBOV diverge significantly in sequence overall, residues contained in this site, the MR78 epitope, are 85% similar between the viruses (Figures 3A and S1B).Figure S2Crystal Structure of EBOV GPcl in Complex with Fab MR78 and KZ52, Related to Figure 2Show full captionStructure of the EBOV GPcl – MR78 – KZ52 ternary complex.

https://openalex.org/W2120612096,"HIV latency is the chief obstacle to eradicating HIV but is widely believed to be an evolutionary accident providing no lentiviral fitness advantage. However, findings of latency being ""hardwired"" into HIV's gene-regulatory circuitry appear inconsistent with latency being an evolutionary accident, given HIV's rapid mutation rate. Here, we propose that latency is an evolutionary ""bet-hedging"" strategy whose frequency has been optimized to maximize lentiviral transmission by reducing viral extinction during mucosal infections. The model quantitatively fits the available patient data, matches observations of high-frequency latency establishment in cell culture and primates, and generates two counterintuitive but testable predictions. The first prediction is that conventional CD8-depletion experiments in SIV-infected macaques increase latent cells more than viremia. The second prediction is that strains engineered to have higher replicative fitness—via reduced latency—will exhibit lower infectivity in animal-model mucosal inoculations. Therapeutically, the theory predicts treatment approaches that may substantially enhance ""activate-and-kill"" HIV-cure strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2014077764,"The breakage-fusion-bridge cycle is a classical mechanism of telomere-driven genome instability in which dysfunctional telomeres are fused to other chromosomal extremities, creating dicentric chromosomes that eventually break at mitosis. Here, we uncover a distinct pathway of telomere-driven genome instability, specifically occurring in cells that maintain telomeres with the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism. We show that, in these cells, telomeric DNA is added to multiple discrete sites throughout the genome, corresponding to regions regulated by NR2C/F transcription factors. These proteins drive local telomere DNA addition by recruiting telomeric chromatin. This mechanism, which we name targeted telomere insertion (TTI), generates potential common fragile sites that destabilize the genome. We propose that TTI driven by NR2C/F proteins contributes to the formation of complex karyotypes in ALT tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2025634477,"Mangrove plants comprise a unique group of organisms that grow within the intertidal zones of tropical and subtropical regions and whose distributions are influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. To understand how these extrinsic and intrinsic processes influence a more fundamental level of the biological hierarchy of mangroves, we studied the genetic diversity of two Neotropical mangrove trees, Avicenniagerminans and A. schaueriana, using microsatellites markers. As reported for other sea-dispersed species, there was a strong differentiation between A. germinans and A. schaueriana populations sampled north and south of the northeastern extremity of South America, likely due to the influence of marine superficial currents. Moreover, we observed fine-scale genetic structures even when no obvious physical barriers were present, indicating pollen and propagule dispersal limitation, which could be explained by isolation-by-distance coupled with mating system differences. We report the first evidence of ongoing hybridization between Avicennia species and that these hybrids are fertile, although this interspecific crossing has not contributed to an increase in the genetic diversity the populations where A. germinans and A. schaueriana hybridize. These findings highlight the complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape the distribution of the genetic diversity in these sea-dispersed colonizer species."
https://openalex.org/W2036688216,"The American Community Survey (ACS) is the largest survey of US households and is the principal source for neighborhood scale information about the US population and economy. The ACS is used to allocate billions in federal spending and is a critical input to social scientific research in the US. However, estimates from the ACS can be highly unreliable. For example, in over 72% of census tracts, the estimated number of children under 5 in poverty has a margin of error greater than the estimate. Uncertainty of this magnitude complicates the use of social data in policy making, research, and governance. This article presents a heuristic spatial optimization algorithm that is capable of reducing the margins of error in survey data via the creation of new composite geographies, a process called regionalization. Regionalization is a complex combinatorial problem. Here rather than focusing on the technical aspects of regionalization we demonstrate how to use a purpose built open source regionalization algorithm to process survey data in order to reduce the margins of error to a user-specified threshold."

Design A strictly controlled randomized crossover study with continuous polysomnography monitoring was performed. Setting Laboratory-based study. Participants 11 healthy male volunteers. Interventions Volunteers attended two three-day sessions: “sleep restriction” alone and “sleep restriction and nap”. Each session involved a baseline night of normal sleep, a night of sleep deprivation and a night of free recovery sleep. Participants were allowed to sleep only from 02:00 to 04:00 during the sleep deprivation night. During the “sleep restriction and nap” session, volunteers took two 30-minute naps, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Measurements and Results Quantitative sensory testing was performed with heat, cold and pressure, at 10:00 and 16:00, on three areas: the supraspinatus, lower back and thigh. After sleep restriction, quantitative sensory testing revealed differential changes in pain stimuli thresholds, but not in thermal threshold detection: lower back heat pain threshold decreased, pressure pain threshold increased in the supraspinatus area and no change was observed for the thigh. Napping restored responses to heat pain stimuli in the lower back and to pressure stimuli in the supraspinatus area. Conclusions Sleep restriction induces different types of hypersensitivity to pain stimuli in different body areas, consistent with multilevel mechanisms, these changes being reversed by napping. The napping restorative effect on pain thresholds result principally from effects on pain mechanisms, since it was independent of vigilance status."

Specific prognostic and predictive markers for prostate cancer patients are still lacking. A causal relationship between androgens and the development of prostate cancer is generally considered biologically plausible, but androgens are not the sole effector in the complexity of prostate carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of progesterone receptor in tumor tissue of T1-3N0 prostate cancer patients undergoing prostatectomy.Tissue microarrays from 535 patients with prostate cancer were constructed. Duplicate cores of tumor cells and tumor stromal tissue from each resected specimen were extracted. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the in-situ expression of progesterone receptor.In univariate analyses, high tumor cell density (p = 0.006) and high tumor stromal cell density level (p = 0.045) of progesterone receptor were both significantly associated with tumor progression and clinical failure. In multivariate analysis, progesterone receptor expression in tumor cells was an independent negative prognostic factor for clinical failure (HR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.2, p = 0.012).High progesterone receptor density in tumor cells of the prostate cancer tumor is an independent negative prognostic factor for clinical failure."

It marks tumor stem cells in mouse models of intestinal neoplasia. Here we sought to determine whether DCLK1 protein can be detected in the bloodstream and if its levels in archived serum samples could be quantitatively assessed in pancreatic cancer patients. DCLK1 specific ELISA, western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses were used to determine expression levels in the serum and staining intensity in archived tumor tissues of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and in pancreatic cancer mouse models. DCLK1 levels in the serum were elevated in early stages of PDAC (stages I and II) compared to healthy volunteers (normal controls). No differences were observed between stages III/IV and normal controls. In resected surgical tissues, DCLK1 expression intensity in the stromal cells was significantly higher than that observed in tumor epithelial cells. Circulating tumor cells were isolated from KPCY mice and approximately 52% of these cells were positive for Dclk1 staining. Dclk1 levels in the serum of KPC mice were also elevated. We have previously demonstrated that DCLK1 plays a potential role in regulating epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Given the increasingly recognized role of EMT derived stem cells in cancer progression and metastasis, we hypothesize that DCLK1 may contribute to the metastatic process. Taken together, our results suggest that DCLK1 serum levels and DCLK1 positive circulating tumor cells should be further assessed for their potential diagnostic and prognostic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1994764105,"Leaf senescence is a tightly regulated developmental or stress-induced process. It is accompanied by dramatic changes in cell metabolism and structure, eventually leading to the disintegration of chloroplasts, the breakdown of leaf proteins, internucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA and ultimately cell death. In light of the global and intense reorganization of the senescing leaf transcriptome, measuring time-course gene expression patterns in this model is challenging due to the evident problems associated with selecting stable reference genes. We have used oligonucleotide microarray data to identify 181 genes with stable expression in the course of dark-induced senescence of barley leaf. From those genes, we selected 5 candidates and confirmed their invariant expression by both reverse transcription quantitative PCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We used the selected reference genes to normalize the level of the expression of the following senescence-responsive genes in ddPCR assays: SAG12, ICL, AGXT, CS and RbcS. We were thereby able to achieve a substantial reduction in the data variability. Although the use of reference genes is not considered mandatory in ddPCR assays, our results show that it is advisable in special cases, specifically those that involve the following conditions: i) a low number of repeats, ii) the detection of low-fold changes in gene expression or iii) series data comparisons (such as time-course experiments) in which large sample variation greatly affects the overall gene expression profile and biological interpretation of the data."

This preclinical study aims to understand the receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated angiogenesis in head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The receptor tyrosine kinase activity in a transgenic mouse model of HNSCC was assessed. The anti-tumorigenetic and anti-angiogenetic effects of cetuximab-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition were investigated in xenograft and transgenic mouse models of HNSCC. The signaling transduction of Notch1 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) was also analyzed. EGFR was overexpressed and activated in the Tgfbr1/Pten deletion (2cKO) mouse model of HNSCC. Cetuximab significantly delayed tumor onset by reducing tumor angiogenesis. This drug exerted similar effects on heterotopic xenograft tumors. In the human HNSCC tissue array, increased EGFR expression correlated with increased HIF-1α and micro vessel density. Cetuximab inhibited tumor-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo by significantly downregulating HIF-1α and Notch1. EGFR is involved in the tumor angiogenesis of HNSCC via the HIF-1α and Notch1 pathways. Therefore, targeting EGFR by suppressing hypoxia- and Notch-induced angiogenesis may benefit HNSCC therapy."

After experimental in-vitro validation, the FEA simulation protocol was transferred to standard contrast-enhanced in-vivo MDCT images to calculate individual hip fracture risk each for 4 subjects with and without a history of osteoporotic vertebral fractures matched by age and gender. In addition, FEA based risk factor calculations were compared to manual femoral BMD measurements of all subjects.In-vitro simulations showed good correlation with the experimentally measured strains both in stance (R2 = 0.963) and fall configuration (R2 = 0.976). The simulated maximum stress overestimated the experimental failure load (4743 N) by 14.7% (5440 N) while the simulated maximum strain overestimated by 4.7% (4968 N). The simulated failed elements coincided precisely with the experimentally determined fracture locations. BMD measurements in subjects with a history of osteoporotic vertebral fractures did not differ significantly from subjects without fragility fractures (femoral head: p = 0.989; femoral neck: p = 0.366), but showed higher FEA based risk factors for additional incident hip fractures (p = 0.028).FEA simulations were successfully validated by elastic and destructive in-vitro experiments. In the subsequent in-vivo analyses, MDCT based FEA based risk factor differences for additional hip fractures were not mirrored by according BMD measurements. Our data suggests, that MDCT derived FEA models may assess bone strength more accurately than BMD measurements alone, providing a valuable in-vivo fracture risk assessment tool."
https://openalex.org/W2046122504,"The biological activity of the edible basidiomycete Antrodia cinnamomea (AC) has been studied extensively. Many effects, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities, have been reported from either crude extracts or compounds isolated from AC. However, research addressing the function of AC in enhancing immunity is rare. The aim of the present study is to investigate the active components and the mechanism involved in the immunostimulatory effect of AC. We found that polysaccharides (PS) in the water extract of AC played a major role in dendritic cell (DC) activation, which is a critical leukocyte in initiating immune responses. We further size purified and identified that the high-molecular weight PS fraction (greater than 100 kDa) exhibited the activating effect. The AC high-molecular weight PSs (AC hmwPSs) promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine production by DCs and the maturation of DCs. In addition, DC-induced antigen-specific T cell activation and Th1 differentiation were increased by AC hmwPSs. In studying the molecular mechanism, we confirmed the activation of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways in DCs after AC hmwPSs treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TLR2 and TLR4 are required for the stimulatory activity of AC hmwPSs on DCs. In a mouse tumor model, we demonstrated that AC hmwPSs enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of the HER-2/neu DNA vaccine by facilitating specific Th1 responses. Thus, we conclude that hmwPSs are the major components of AC that stimulate DCs via the TLR2/TLR4 and NF-κB/MAPK signaling pathways. The AC hmwPSs have potential to be applied as adjuvants."

We tested whether exposure to hypobaric hypoxia at moderate altitude impairs the static postural control of healthy subjects. Methods In 51 healthy men, median age 24 y (quartiles 20;28), static control was evaluated on a balance platform in Zurich, 490 m, and during a 4-day sojourn in Swiss mountain villages at 1630 m and 2590 m, 2 days each. The order of altitude exposure was randomized. Total center of pressure path length (COPL) and sway amplitude measured in two directions by a balance platform, and pulse oximetry were recorded. Data were compared between altitudes. Results Median (quartiles) COPL during standing on both legs with eyes open at 490 m and in the evenings on the first and second days at 1630 and 2590 m, respectively were: 50 (45;57), 55 (48;62), 56 (49;61), 53 (47;59), 54 (48;60) cm, P<0.001 ANOVA. Corresponding arterial oxygen saturation was 97% (96;97), 95% (94;96), 95%(94;96), 92%(90;93), 93%(91;93), P<0.001. Anterior-posterior sway amplitudes were larger at 1630 and 2590 m compared to 490 m, P<0.001. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed that higher altitudes (1630 and 2590m) were independently associated with increased COPL when controlled for the order of altitude exposure and age (P=0.001). Conclusions Exposure to 1630 and 2590m was associated with impaired static postural control even when visual references were available. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01130948."
https://openalex.org/W2032929074,"Molecular traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which acts as a highly selective channel perforating the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exploits the nucleocytoplasmic pathway to export its RNA transcripts across the NPC to the cytoplasm. Despite extensive study on the HIV life cycle and the many drugs developed to target this cycle, no current drugs have been successful in targeting the critical process of viral nuclear export, even though HIV's reliance on a single host protein, CRM1, to export its unspliced and partially spliced RNA transcripts makes it a tempting target. Due to recent findings implicating a DEAD-box helicase, DDX3, in HIV replication and a member of the export complex, it has become an appealing target for anti-HIV drug inhibition. In the present research, we have applied a hybrid computational protocol to analyze protein-protein interactions in the HIV mRNA export cycle. This method is based on molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics simulation and accompanied by approximate free energy calculation (MM/GBSA), computational alanine scanning, clustering, and evolutionary analysis. We highlight here some of the most likely binding modes and interfacial residues between DDX3 and CRM1 both in the absence and presence of RanGTP. This work shows that although DDX3 can bind to free CRM1, addition of RanGTP leads to more concentrated distribution of binding modes and stronger binding between CRM1 and RanGTP."

The search for new antifungal drug targets is critical, and the synthesis of the cell wall represents a potential area to find such a target. Embedded within the main β-1,3-glucan core of the A. fumigatus cell wall is a mixed linkage, β-D-(1,3;1,4)-glucan. The role of this molecule or how it is synthesized is unknown, though it comprises 10% of the glucans within the wall. While this is not a well-studied molecule in fungi, it has been studied in plants. Using the sequences of two plant mixed linkage glucan synthases, a single ortholog was identified in A. fumigatus (Tft1). A strain lacking this enzyme (tft1Δ) was generated along with revertant strains containing the native gene under the control of either the native or a strongly expressing promoter. Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against β-(1,3;1,4)-glucan and biochemical quantification of this polysaccharide in the tft1Δ strain demonstrated complete loss of this molecule. Reintroduction of the gene into the knockout strain yielded reappearance in amounts that correlated with expected expression of the gene. The loss of Tft1 and mixed linkage glucan yielded no in vitro growth phenotype. However, there was a modest increase in virulence for the tft1Δ strain in a wax worm model. While the precise roles for β-(1,3;1,4)-glucan within A. fumigatus cell wall are still uncertain, it is clear that Tft1 plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of this cell wall polysaccharide."

Dietary Se yeast supplementation decreased (Pμ0.05) the serum levels of TNF-α, but had no significant effect on the activity of SOD and the levels of MDA, CRP and IL-1β between experimental and control groups. Dietary Se yeast supplementation had little effect on the PCV2 virus load in the liver, spleen and lung. However, mice in the selenium yeast group showed a significant decrease in microscopic lesion scores in the lung and spleen compared with those in the control group (Pμ0.05).

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the interaction between EGFR and its targeting biomolecules. The main aim of this study was to estimate the binding affinity and adhesion force of two targeting molecules, anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb LA1) and the peptide GE11 (YHWYGYTPQNVI), with respect to EGFR and to compare these values with those obtained for the ligand, EGF. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for evaluating the binding affinity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to estimate the adhesion force. In the case of EGFR, the KD of EGF, GE11, and mAb LA1 were 1.77 × 10−7, 4.59 × 10−4 and 2.07 × 10−9, respectively, indicating that the binding affinity of mAb LA1 to EGFR was higher than that of EGF, while the binding affinity of GE11 to EGFR was the lowest among the three molecules. The adhesion force between EGFR and mAb LA1 was 210.99 pN, which is higher than that observed for EGF (209.41 pN), while the adhesion force between GE11 and EGFR was the lowest (59.51 pN). These results suggest that mAb LA1 binds to EGFR with higher binding affinity than EGF and GE11. Moreover, the adhesion force between mAb LA1 and EGFR was greater than that observed for EGF and GE11. The SPR and AFM experiments confirmed the interaction between the receptor and targeting molecules. The results of this study might aid the screening of ligands for receptor targeting and drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2112479132,"Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic allergic disorder, whose pathobiology is incompletely understood. Histamine-producing cells including mast cells and basophils have been implicated in EoE. However, very little is currently known about the role of histamine and histamine receptor (HR) expression and signaling in the esophageal epithelium. Herein, we characterized HR (H1R, H2R, H3R, and H4R) expression in human esophageal biopsies and investigate the role of histamine signaling in inducible cytokine expression in human esophageal epithelial cells in vitro. HR expression was quantified in esophageal biopsies from non-EoE control (N = 23), inactive EoE (<15 eos/hpf, N = 26) and active EoE (>15 eos/hpf, N = 22) subjects using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescent localization. HR expression and histamine-mediated cytokine secretion were evaluated in human primary and telomerase-immortalized esophageal epithelial cells. H1R, H2R, and H4R expression were increased in active EoE biopsies compared to inactive EoE and controls. H2R was the most abundantly expressed receptor, and H3R expression was negligible in all 3 cohorts. Infiltrating eosinophils expressed H1R, H2R, and H4R, which contributed to the observed increase in HR in active subjects. H1R and H2R, but not H3R or H4R, were constitutively expressed by primary and immortalized cells, and epithelial histamine stimulation induced GM-CSF, TNFα, and IL-8, but not TSLP or eotaxin-3 secretion. Epithelial priming with the TLR3 ligand poly (I:C) induced H1R and H2R expression, and enhanced histamine-induced GM-CSF, TNFα, and IL-8 secretion. These effects were primarily suppressed by H1R antagonists, but unaffected by H2R antagonism. Histamine directly activates esophageal epithelial cytokine secretion in vitro in an H1R dependent fashion. However, H1R, H2R and H4R are induced in active inflammation in EoE in vivo. While systemic antihistamine (anti-H1R) therapy may not induce clinical remission in EoE, our study suggests that further study of histamine receptor signaling in EoE is warranted and that targeting of additional histamine receptors may lead to novel treatment strategies for this important disease."
https://openalex.org/W2025471094,"The nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) of the Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a small basic protein containing two zinc fingers. About 2000 NCp7 molecules coat the genomic RNA in the HIV-1 virion. After infection of a target cell, the viral core enters into the cytoplasm, where NCp7 chaperones the reverse transcription of the genomic RNA into the proviral DNA. As a consequence of their much lower affinity for double-stranded DNA as compared to single-stranded RNAs, NCp7 molecules are thought to be released in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected cells in the late steps of reverse transcription. Yet, little is known on the cellular distribution of the released NCp7 molecules and on their possible interactions with cell components. Hence, the aim of this study was to identify potential cellular partners of NCp7 and to monitor its intracellular distribution and dynamics by means of confocal fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy, and raster imaging correlation spectroscopy. HeLa cells transfected with eGFP-labeled NCp7 were used as a model system. We found that NCp7-eGFP localizes mainly in the cytoplasm and the nucleoli, where it binds to cellular RNAs, and notably to ribosomal RNAs which are the most abundant. The binding of NCp7 to ribosomes was further substantiated by the intracellular co-diffusion of NCp7 with the ribosomal protein 26, a component of the large ribosomal subunit. Finally, gradient centrifugation experiments demonstrate a direct association of NCp7 with purified 80S ribosomes. Thus, our data suggest that NCp7 molecules released in newly infected cells may primarily bind to ribosomes, where they may exert a new potential role in HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2029577905,"Background Peritoneal fibrosis is the major cause of ultrafiltration failure, and intraperitoneal administration of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) was reported to protect peritoneal function. But the exact mechanism of its influence on peritoneal structure and function is still unknown. Methods A fibrosis model of rat was established by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of PD fluid and Erythromycin Lactobionate. Fifty-two rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: (1) normal control group (CON, n = 6); (2) normal saline group (NS, n = 10); (3) high-glucose group (GLU, n = 10); (4) heparin group (HEP, n = 6); (5) low dose LMWH group (LLMWH, n = 10); (6) high dose LMWH group (HLMWH, n = 10). Two hour peritoneal equilibration test was performed after 28 days of intervention. The peritoneum, mesentery and omentum were harvested, and evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin and Masson Trichrome staining. The expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF and TGF-β1 in parietal peritoneum were detected by IHC and RT-PCR (Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction). Results Compared with group CON and NS, ultrafiltration volume and D2/D0 glucose in group GLU decreased significantly, D/Purea (Dialysate-Plasma ratio of urea), D/Palb (Dialysate-Plasma ratio of albumin), peritoneal thickness, neoangiogenesis and inflammatory reaction increased significantly (all P<0.05). Administration of heparin and LMWH markedly alleviated these above pathological changes. The protein and mRNA levels of HIF-1α, VEGF and TGF-β1 increased significantly in group GLU, and decreased significantly after administration of LMWH in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions LMWH ameliorates peritoneal function and inhibits peritoneal fibrosis, possibly through suppression of HIF-1α, VEGF and TGF-β1."
https://openalex.org/W1981906805,"Methyl bromide (MB) and other alternatives were evaluated for suppression of Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Meloidogyne spp. and their influence on soil microbial communities. Both Fusarium spp. and Phytophthora spp. were significantly reduced by the MB (30.74 mg kg-1), methyl iodide (MI: 45.58 mg kg-1), metham sodium (MS: 53.92 mg kg-1) treatments. MS exhibited comparable effectiveness to MB in controlling Meloidogyne spp. and total nematodes, followed by MI at the tested rate. By contrast, sulfuryl fluoride (SF: 33.04 mg kg-1) and chloroform (CF: 23.68 mg kg-1) showed low efficacy in controlling Fusarium spp., Phytophthora spp., and Meloidogyne spp. MB, MI and MS significantly lowered the abundance of different microbial populations and microbial biomass in soil, whereas SF and CF had limited influence on them compared with the control. Diversity indices in Biolog studies decreased in response to fumigation, but no significant difference was found among treatments in PLFA studies. Principal component and cluster analyses of Biolog and PLFA data sets revealed that MB and MI treatments greatly influenced the soil microbial community functional and structural diversity compared with SF treatment. These results suggest that fumigants with high effectiveness in suppressing soil-borne disease could significantly influence soil microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2004724714,"Background Somatostatin (SST) has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Our aims were to analyze and compare the SST expression during normal aging and colorectal carcinogenesis at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we tested the methylation status of SST in biopsy samples, and the cell growth inhibitory effect of the SST analogue octreotide in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. Methods Colonic samples were collected from healthy children (n1 = 6), healthy adults (n2 = 41) and colorectal cancer patients (CRCs) (n3 = 34) for SST mRNA expression analysis, using HGU133 Plus2.0 microarrays. Results were validated both on original (n1 = 6; n2 = 6; n3 = 6) and independent samples ((n1 = 6; n2 = 6; n3 = 6) by real-time PCR. SST expressing cells were detected by immunohistochemistry on colonic biopsy samples (n1 = 14; n2 = 20; n3 = 23). The effect of octreotide on cell growth was tested on Caco-2 cell line. SST methylation percentage in biopsy samples (n1 = 5; n2 = 5; n3 = 9) was defined using methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion. Results In case of normal aging SST mRNA expression did not alter, but decreased in cancer (p<0.05). The ratio of SST immunoreactive cells was significantly higher in children (0.70%±0.79%) compared to CRC (0%±0%) (p<0.05). Octreotide significantly increased the proportion of apoptotic Caco-2 cells. SST showed significantly higher methylation level in tumor samples (30.2%±11.6%) compared to healthy young individuals (3.5%±1.9%) (p<0.05). Conclusions In cancerous colonic mucosa the reduced SST production may contribute to the uncontrolled cell proliferation. Our observation that in colon cancer cells octreotide significantly enhanced cell death and attenuated cell proliferation suggests that SST may act as a regulator of epithelial cell kinetics. The inhibition of SST expression in CRC can be epigenetically regulated by promoter hypermethylation."
https://openalex.org/W1963598914,"Present study was designed to examine daily and seasonal variability in the innate immune responses of splenocytes in the fresh water snake, Natrix piscator. Animals were mildly anesthetized and spleen was aseptically isolated and processed for macrophage phagocytosis, NBT reduction, nitrite production, splenocyte proliferation and serum lysozyme activity. Samples were collected at seven time points, viz., 0000, 0400, 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000 and 0000 h during three different seasons, namely summer, winter and spring. Cosinor analysis revealed that percent phagocytosis had a significant 24-h rhythm during summer and spring seasons. The peaks of rhythms in NBT reduction and nitrite release occurred in the morning hours at 10.88 h and 8.31 h, respectively, in winter. A significant 24-h rhythm was also observed in lysozyme concentration and splenocyte proliferation (both Basal and Concanavalin A stimulated) in all three seasons. A significant phase shift in splenocyte proliferation was obtained with a trend of delayed phase shift from winter to spring and from spring to summer. Of the nine variables, significant annual (seasonal) rhythms were detected in almost all variables, excluding phagocytic and splenosomatic indices. All rhythmic variables, except spleen cellularity, exhibited tightly synchronized peaks coinciding with the progressive and recrudescence phases of annual reproductive cycle. It is concluded that the snake synchronizes its daily and seasonal immune activity with the corresponding external time cues. The enhancement of immune function coinciding with one of its crucial reproductive phases might be helping it to cope with the seasonal stressors, including abundance of pathogens, which would otherwise jeopardize the successful reproduction and eventual survival of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2075265097,"The human serum proteome has been extensively screened for biomarkers. However, the large dynamic range of protein concentrations in serum and the presence of highly abundant and large molecular weight proteins, make identification and detection changes in the amount of low-molecular weight proteins (LMW, molecular weight ≤ 30kDa) difficult. Here, we developed a gel-filter method including four layers of different concentration of tricine SDS-PAGE-based gels to block high-molecular weight proteins and enrich LMW proteins. By utilizing this method, we identified 1,576 proteins (n = 2) from 10 μL serum. Among them, 559 (n = 2) proteins belonged to LMW proteins. Furthermore, this gel-filter method could identify 67.4% and 39.8% more LMW proteins than that in representative methods of glycine SDS-PAGE and optimized-DS, respectively. By utilizing SILAC-AQUA approach with labeled recombinant protein as internal standard, the recovery rate for GST spiked in serum during the treatment of gel-filter, optimized-DS, and ProteoMiner was 33.1 ± 0.01%, 18.7 ± 0.01% and 9.6 ± 0.03%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the gel-filter method offers a rapid, highly reproducible and efficient approach for screening biomarkers from serum through proteomic analyses."

The activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) has been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nonfamilial AF and polymorphisms in RAS gene. Methods A total of 931 patients with nonfamilial AF, 663 non-AF heart disease patients and 727 healthy subjects were selected. 10 tagSNPs (tSNPs) (ACE gene rs8066114, AGT gene rs7539020, rs3789678, rs2478544, rs11568023, rs2478523, rs4762, rs699 and CYP11B2 rs3802230, rs3097) were chosen and genotyped in our study. Single-locus analysis and haplotype analysis were used in this study. Results In single-locus analysis, we found rs11568023 and rs3789678 in AGT gene were associated with nonfamilial AF in Chinese Han population. AF risk was associated with rs3789678 between the AF group and control groups. Under dominant model, the significant AF risk was observed in rs3789678 between the AF group and non AF heart control group; And the protective effect was found in rs11568023, compared with the non-AF heart disease control group. In multilocus haplotype analysis, the association between frequencies of the haplotypes and AF risk was showed in AGT gene (rs7539020-rs3789678), compared ‘TT’ haplotype with the common ‘TC’ haplotype, adjusted for age, gender, LVEF, LVEDD, LAD and frequency of hypertension and diabetes. The diplotype with ‘TC’, carrying rs3789678-C-allele, was associated with reduced risk of AF between the AF group and the healthy control group. The diplotype with ‘TT’ haplotype in the same block, carrying rs3789678-T-allele, was associated with increased risk of AF. Conclusions Via a large-scale case-control study, we found that rs3789678 site was potential susceptible locus of AF whereas rs11568023 was protective factor."
https://openalex.org/W1990884119,"Few field studies have investigated how changes at one trophic level can affect the invasibility of other trophic levels. We examined the hypothesis that the spread of an introduced alga in disturbed seagrass beds with degraded canopies depends on the depletion of large consumers. We mimicked the degradation of seagrass canopies by clipping shoot density and reducing leaf length, simulating natural and anthropogenic stressors such as fish overgrazing and water quality. Caulerpa racemosa was transplanted into each plot and large consumers were excluded from half of them using cages. Potential cage artifacts were assessed by measuring irradiance, scouring by leaf movement, water flow, and sedimentation. Algal invasion of the seagrass bed differed based on the size of consumers. The alga had higher cover and size under the cages, where the seagrass was characterized by reduced shoot density and canopy height. Furthermore, canopy height had a significant effect depending on canopy density. The alteration of seagrass canopies increased the spread of C. racemosa only when large consumers were absent. Our results suggest that protecting declining habitats and/or restoring fish populations will limit the expansion of C. racemosa. Because MPAs also enhance the abundance and size of fish consuming seagrass they can indirectly promote algal invasion. The effects of MPAs on invasive species are context dependent and require balancing opposing forces, such as the conservation of seagrass canopy structure and the protection of fish grazing the seagrass."
https://openalex.org/W2071177576,"Background Changes in cerebral metabolite ratios (CMR) measured on 1H-MRS and changes in cognitive function (CF) are described in subjects commencing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), although the dynamics of such changes are poorly understood. Methods Neuroasymptomatic, HIV-infected subjects electively commencing cART were eligible. CMR were assessed in three anatomical voxels and CF assessed at baseline, week 48 and week 144. Overall differences in absolute change in CMRs and CF parameters between 0–48 and 48–144 weeks were assessed. Results Twenty-two subjects completed study procedures. Plasma HIV-RNA was <50 copies/mL in all at week 48 and in all, but two subjects at week 144. In general, between weeks 0–48 a rise in N-acetyl-aspartate(NAA)/Creatine(Cr) ratio and a decline in myo-Inositol(mI)/Cr ratio were observed. Between weeks 48–144, small rises in NAA/Cr ratio were observed in two anatomical voxels, whereas a rise in mI/Cr ratio was observed in all anatomical locations (0.31 (0.66) and -0.27 (1.35) between weeks 0–48 and 0.13 (0.91) and 1.13 (1.71) between weeks 48–144 for absolute changes in NAA/Cr and mI/Cr (SD) in frontal-grey voxel, respectively). Global CF score improved between weeks 0–48 and then declined between weeks 48–144 (0.63 (1.16) and -0.63 (0.1.41) for mean absolute change (SD) between weeks 0–48 and weeks 48–144, respectively). Conclusions The direction of change of cerebral function parameters differs over time in HIV-infected subjects commencing cART, highlighting the need for long-term follow-up in such studies. The changes we have observed between weeks 48–144 may represent the initial development of cerebral toxicities from cART."
https://openalex.org/W1967695536,"Endo-β-1, 4-mannanase from Thermotoga petrophila (TpMan) is a modular hyperthermostable enzyme involved in the degradation of mannan-containing polysaccharides. The degradation of these polysaccharides represents a key step for several industrial applications. Here, as part of a continuing investigation of TpMan, the region corresponding to the GH5 domain (TpManGH5) was characterized as a function of pH and temperature. The results indicated that the enzymatic activity of the TpManGH5 is pH-dependent, with its optimum activity occurring at pH 6. At pH 8, the studies demonstrated that TpManGH5 is a molecule with a nearly spherical tightly packed core displaying negligible flexibility in solution, and with size and shape very similar to crystal structure. However, TpManGH5 experiences an increase in radius of gyration in acidic conditions suggesting expansion of the molecule. Furthermore, at acidic pH values, TpManGH5 showed a less globular shape, probably due to a loop region slightly more expanded and flexible in solution (residues Y88 to A105). In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that conformational changes caused by pH variation did not change the core of the TpManGH5, which means that only the above mentioned loop region presents high degree of fluctuations. The results also suggested that conformational changes of the loop region may facilitate polysaccharide and enzyme interaction. Finally, at pH 6 the results indicated that TpManGH5 is slightly more flexible at 65°C when compared to the same enzyme at 20°C. The biophysical characterization presented here is well correlated with the enzymatic activity and provide new insight into the structural basis for the temperature and pH-dependent activity of the TpManGH5. Also, the data suggest a loop region that provides a starting point for a rational design of biotechnological desired features."
https://openalex.org/W2017469718,"Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) have been implicated in diverse physiological functions. ROCK1 phosphorylates and activates ZIPK suggesting that at least some of these physiological functions may require both enzymes. To test the hypothesis that sequential activation of ROCK1 and ZIPK is commonly involved in regulatory pathways, we utilized siRNA to knock down ROCK1 and ZIPK in cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC). Microarray analysis using a whole-transcript expression chip identified changes in gene expression induced by ROCK1 and ZIPK knockdown. ROCK1 knockdown affected the expression of 553 genes, while ZIPK knockdown affected the expression of 390 genes. A high incidence of regulation of transcription regulator genes was observed in both knockdowns. Other affected groups included transporters, kinases, peptidases, transmembrane and G protein-coupled receptors, growth factors, phosphatases and ion channels. Only 76 differentially expressed genes were common to ROCK1 and ZIPK knockdown. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified five pathways shared between the two knockdowns. We focused on cytokine signaling pathways since ROCK1 knockdown up-regulated 5 and down-regulated 4 cytokine genes, in contrast to ZIPK knockdown, which affected the expression of only two cytokine genes (both down-regulated). IL-6 gene expression and secretion of IL-6 protein were up-regulated by ROCK1 knockdown, whereas ZIPK knockdown reduced IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 protein secretion and increased ROCK1 protein expression, suggesting that ROCK1 may inhibit IL-6 secretion. IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were increased in response to ROCK1 knockdown. Differences in the effects of ROCK1 and ZIPK knockdown on cell cycle regulatory genes suggested that ROCK1 and ZIPK regulate the cell cycle by different mechanisms. ROCK1, but not ZIPK knockdown reduced the viability and inhibited proliferation of vascular SMC. We conclude that ROCK1 and ZIPK have diverse, but predominantly distinct regulatory functions in vascular SMC and that ROCK1-mediated activation of ZIPK is not involved in most of these functions."
https://openalex.org/W2051639994,"BACKGROUND: Studies show that thousands of genes are associated with prognosis of breast cancer. Towards utilizing available genetic data, efforts have been made to predict outcomes using gene expression data, and a number of commercial products have been developed. These products have the following shortcomings: 1) They use the Cox model for prediction. However, the RSF model has been shown to significantly outperform the Cox model. 2) Testing was not done to see if a complete set of clinical predictors could predict as well as the gene expression signatures.

METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We address these shortcomings. The METABRIC data set concerns 1981 breast cancer tumors. Features include 21 clinical features, expression levels for 16,384 genes, and survival. We compare the survival prediction performance of the Cox model and the RSF model using the clinical data and the gene expression data to their performance using only the clinical data. We obtain significantly better results when we used both clinical data and gene expression data for 5 year, 10 year, and 15 year survival prediction. When we replace the gene expression data by PAM50 subtype, our results are significant only for 5 year and 15 year prediction. We obtain significantly better results using the RSF model over the Cox model. Finally, our results indicate that gene expression data alone may predict long-term survival.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that we can obtain improved survival prediction using clinical data and gene expression data compared to prediction using only clinical data. We further conclude that we can obtain improved survival prediction using the RSF model instead of the Cox model. These results are significant because by incorporating more gene expression data with clinical features and using the RSF model, we could develop decision support systems that better utilize heterogeneous information to improve outcome prediction and decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2082928090,"In natural signals, such as the luminance value across of a visual scene, abrupt changes in intensity value are often more relevant to an organism than intensity values at other positions and times. Thus to reduce redundancy, sensory systems are specialized to detect the times and amplitudes of informative abrupt changes in the input stream rather than coding the intensity values at all times. In theory, a system that responds transiently to fast changes is called a differentiator. In principle, several different neural circuit mechanisms exist that are capable of responding transiently to abrupt input changes. However, it is unclear which circuit would be best suited for early sensory systems, where the dynamic range of the natural input signals can be very wide. We here compare the properties of different simple neural circuit motifs for implementing signal differentiation. We found that a circuit motif based on presynaptic inhibition (PI) is unique in a sense that the vesicle resources in the presynaptic site can be stably maintained over a wide range of stimulus intensities, making PI a biophysically plausible mechanism to implement a differentiator with a very wide dynamical range. Moreover, by additionally considering short-term plasticity (STP), differentiation becomes contrast adaptive in the PI-circuit but not in other potential neural circuit motifs. Numerical simulations show that the behavior of the adaptive PI-circuit is consistent with experimental observations suggesting that adaptive presynaptic inhibition might be a good candidate neural mechanism to achieve differentiation in early sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W1993398767,"Background Pregnancy is an important stimulus of bone lead release. Elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes for mothers and harmful lead effects on fetuses. However, the reports about maternal BLL changes during pregnancy are conflicting to some extent. This article is to explore the variations in BLLs among pregnant women. The relationships of BLLs with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T, A1298C, and G1793A polymorphisms, which are associated with bone resorption, were also studied. A total of 973 women, including 234, 249, and 248 women in their first, second, and third trimesters, respectively, and 242 non-pregnant women, were recruited at the Wuhan Women and Children Medical Health Center. Methods BLLs were determined using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of MTHFR were identified with the TaqMan probe method. Results The geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) of BLLs was 16.2 (1.78) μg/L for all participants. All the studied MTHFR alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Multiple-linear regression analysis revealed the following results. Among the pregnant women, those that carried MTHFR 677CC (i.e. wild-genotype homozygote) and 1298CC (i.e. mutant-genotype homozygote) exhibited higher BLLs than those that carried 677CT/TT (standardized β = 0.074, P = 0.042) and 1298AC/AA (standardized β = 0.077, P = 0.035) when other covariates (e.g., age, no. of children, education and income, etc.) were adjusted. The BLLs of pregnant women consistently decreased during the pregnancy and these levels positively correlated with BMI (standard β = 0.086–0.096, P<0.05). Conclusions The 1298CC mutant-type homozygote in the MTHFR gene is a risk factor for high BLLs among low-level environmental lead-exposed Chinese pregnant women, whose BLLs consistently decreased during gestation."

https://openalex.org/W2012946124,"Wheel force transducer (WFT), which measures the three-axis forces and three-axis torques applied to the wheel, is an important instrument in the vehicle testing field and has been extremely promoted by researchers with great interests. The transducer, however, is typically mounted on the wheel of a moving vehicle, especially on a high speed car, when abruptly accelerating or braking, the mass/inertia of the transducer/wheel itself will have an extra effect on the sensor response so that the inertia/mass loads will also be detected and coupled into the signal outputs. The effect which is considered to be inertia coupling problem will decrease the sensor accuracy. In this paper, the inertia coupling of a universal WFT under multi-axis accelerations is investigated. According to the self-decoupling approach of the WFT, inertia load distribution is solved based on the principle of equivalent mass and rotary inertia, thus then inertia impact can be identified with the theoretical derivation. The verification is achieved by FEM simulation and experimental tests. Results show that strains in simulation agree well with the theoretical derivation. The relationship between the applied acceleration and inertia load for both wheel force and moment is the approximate linear, respectively. All the relative errors are less than 5% which are within acceptable and the inertia loads have the maximum impact on the signal output about 1.5% in the measurement range."
https://openalex.org/W1994366903,"We determined the frequencies of dicentric chromosomes per cell in non-dividing confluent normal human fibroblasts (MRC-5) irradiated with a single 1 Gy dose or a fractionated 1 Gy dose (10X0.1 Gy, 5X0.2 Gy, and 2X0.5 Gy). The interval between fractions was between 1 min to 1440 min. After the completion of X-irradiation, the cells were incubated for 24 hours before re-plating at a low density. Then, demecolcine was administrated at 6 hours, and the first mitotic cells were collected for 42 hours. Our study demonstrated that frequencies of dicentric chromosomes in cells irradiated with a 1 Gy dose at different fractions were significantly reduced if the fraction interval was increased from 1 min to 5 min (p<0.05, χ2-test). Further increasing the fraction interval from 5 up to 1440 min did not significantly affect the frequency of dicentric chromosomes. Since misrejoining of two independent chromosome breaks introduced in close proximity gives rise to dicentric chromosome, our results indicated that such circumstances might be quite infrequent in cells exposed to fractionated X-irradiation with prolonged fraction intervals. Our findings should contribute to improve current estimation of cancer risk from chronic low-dose-rate exposure, or intermittent exposure of low-dose radiation by medical exposure."

Animal models indicate similar potential risks. It remains unclear what molecular mechanisms may be operating during in vitro culture to predispose the embryo to these diseases. One of the limitations faced by investigators is the paucity of the material in the preimplantation embryo to test for molecular analysis. To address this problem, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) from blastocysts conceived after natural mating (mESCFB) or after IVF, using optimal (KSOM + 5% O2; mESCKAA) and suboptimal (Whitten’s Medium, + 20% O2, mESCWM) conditions. All three groups of embryos showed similar behavior during both derivation and differentiation into their respective mESC lines. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of microarray data showed that blastocyst culture does not affect the transcriptome of derived mESCs. Transcriptomic changes previously observed in the inner cell mass (ICM) of embryos derived in the same conditions were not present in mESCs, regardless of method of conception or culture medium, suggesting that mESC do not fully maintain a memory of the events occurring prior to their derivation. We conclude that the fertilization method or culture media used to generate blastocysts does not affect differentiation potential, morphology and transcriptome of mESCs."
