https://openalex.org/W4283455067,"Globally most maternal deaths occur during the postpartum period; however, the burden is disproportionately higher in some Sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Health's annual report, in 2019 alone, nearly 70% of maternal deaths happen during the postpartum period. Although several studies have been conducted on postpartum maternal deaths in Ethiopia, most of the studies were focused either on individual-level or district-level determinants with limited emphasis on the timing of death and in relatively small and localized areas. Therefore, this study aimed at identifying the determinants of postpartum death both at an individual and districts level, which could shed light on designing pragmatic policies to reduce postpartum maternal death.The study utilized secondary data obtained from the Ethiopian maternal death surveillance system. A total of 4316 reviewed maternal death from 645 districts of Ethiopia were included in the analysis. A multilevel multinomial logistic regression model was applied to examine factors significantly associated with postpartum maternal death in Ethiopia.The findings revealed that 65.1% of maternal deaths occurred during the postpartum period. The factors associated with postpartum death included previous medical history (history of ANC follow up and party), medical causes (obstetrics haemorrhage, hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, pregnancy-related infection, and non-obstetrics complication), personal factors (poor knowledge of obstetrics complication), and facility-level barriers (shortage of life-saving maternal commodities and delay in receiving treatment).Almost seven in ten maternal deaths happen during the postpartum period. The rate was even higher for some women based on their previous medical history, level of awareness about obstetrics complication, medical conditions, as well as the readiness of the health facility at which the women was served. Since the postpartum period is identified as a critical time for reducing maternal death, policies and actions must be directed towards improving health education, ANC service utilization, and facility-level readiness."
https://openalex.org/W4283463309,"Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is useful for tracking and monitoring the level of disease prevalence in a community and has been used extensively to complement clinical testing during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the numerous benefits, sources of variability in sample storage, handling, and processing methods can make WBE data difficult to generalize. We performed an experiment to determine sources of variability in WBE data including the impact of storage time, handling, and processing techniques on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater influent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in North Carolina over 19 days. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration in influent samples held at 4°C did not degrade significantly over the 19-day experiment. Heat pasteurization did not significantly impact the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 at two of the three WWTP but did reduce viral recovery at the WWTP with the smallest population size served. On each processing date, one filter from each sample was processed immediately while a replicate filter was frozen at -80°C. Once processed, filters previously frozen were found to contain slightly higher concentrations (&lt;0.2 log copies/L) than their immediately processed counterparts, indicating freezing filters is a viable method for delayed quantification and may even improve recovery at WWTP with low viral concentrations. Investigation of factors contributing to variability during sample processing indicated that analyst experience level contributed significantly ( p &lt;0.001) to accepted droplet generation while extraction efficiency and reverse transcription efficiency contributed significantly ( p &lt;0.05) to day-to-day SARS-CoV-2 variability. This study provides valuable practical information for minimizing decay and/or loss of SARS CoV-2 in wastewater influent while adhering to safety procedures, promoting efficient laboratory workflows, and accounting for sources of variability."
https://openalex.org/W4283457776,"The best way to eradicate corona virus disease (COVID-19) viral infection is mass vaccination. Many studies demonstrate vaccination is associated with some local and systemic side effects. This study aimed to provide evidence on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine side effects.Institutional based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 254 health workers at Nigist Eleni Mohammed memorial comprehensive specialized hospital (from July 01/ 2021 to July 30/2021). Data were collected consecutively through self-administered online survey created on Google Forms of platform which had been randomly delivered via (Facebook or telegram pages). Demographic data of participants, side effect after first and second dose of vaccine were covered.The prevalence of at least one side effect after first dose was 91.3% and after second dose was 67%. Injection site pain (63.8% vs. 50.4%), headache (48.8% vs. 33.5%), fever (38.8% vs. 20.9%), muscle pain (38.8% vs. 21.7%), fatigue (26% vs. 28.7%, tenderness at the site (27.6% vs. 21.7%), and joint pain (27.6% vs. 20.9%) were the most commonly reported side effects after first and second dose vaccine respectively. Most of participants reported that their symptoms emerged after 6hr of vaccination and only less than 5% of participant's symptoms lasted more than 72hr of post vaccination. The younger age (≤29 year) were more susceptible to at least one side effect (χ 2 = 4.2; p = 0.04) after first dose.The prevalence of side effect after first and second dose vaccine was higher. Most of the symptoms were short lived and mild. This result might help to solve an emerging public health challenge (vaccine hesitancy) nurtured by misinformation related to vaccines safety."
https://openalex.org/W4283378940,"Those with low socioeconomic status have an increased risk of stroke, more severe strokes, reduced access to treatment, and more adverse outcomes after stroke. The question is why these differences are present. In this study we investigate to which extent the association between low socioeconomic status and stroke severity can be explained by differences in risk factors and stroke prevention drugs.The study included 86 316 patients registered with an ischemic stroke in the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke) 2012-2016. Data on socioeconomic status was retrieved from the Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA) by individual linkage. We used education level as proxy for socioeconomic status, with primary school education classified as low education. Stroke severity was measured using the Reaction Level Scale, with values above 1 classified as severe strokes. To investigate the pathways via risk factors and stroke prevention drugs we performed a mediation analysis estimating indirect and direct effects.Low education was associated with an excess risk of a severe stroke compared to mid/high education (absolute risk difference 1.4%, 95% CI: 1.0%-1.8%), adjusting for confounders. Of this association 28.5% was an indirect effect via risk factors (absolute risk difference 0.4%, 95% CI: 0.3%-0.5%), while the indirect effect via stroke prevention drugs was negligible.Almost one third of the association between low education and severe stroke was explained by risk factors, and clinical effort should be taken to reduce these risk factors to decrease stroke severity among those with low socioeconomic status."
https://openalex.org/W4283397221,"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a significant and inaugural project of the ""Belt and Road"" initiative which is considered as structure and manifesto for panoramic and fundamental collaboration between China and Pakistan. The CPEC project was initiated to develop economic growth and facilitate free trade between both countries. However, it has generated immense employment opportunities, education facilities, and improved quality of life for local citizens, specifically women, as well as international overreach. This study investigates and examines the benefits of CPEC project and its influence on women empowerment. Based on the background of the CPEC, this study has been carried out by applying a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to fill the gap. Data was aggregated with the help of a survey questionnaire and interviews from the residents of the Thar region of Pakistan, which comes under CPEC route. In total, 306 samples were acquired and analysed using different statistical tools such as SPSS (Statistical package for social sciences) and PLS (Partial least squares) to formulate the study results. The findings revealed that the development of CPEC has remarkably improved the quality of life for women by providing enormous employment opportunities, education facilities, skills enhancement programs, and training facilities. The analyzed results will guide government policymakers and officials to promote operational activities in the region, develop new educational institutions, and create employment opportunities for the local community and women to obtain further development of CPEC projects."
https://openalex.org/W4283366461,"To investigate the objective sleep influencers behind older adult responses to subjective sleep measures, in this case, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Based on previous literature, we hypothesized that SE would be associated with PSQI reported sleep disruption. Furthermore, because SOL increases progressively with age and it tends to be easily remembered by the patients, we also expected it to be one of the main predictors of the perceived sleep quality in the elderly.We studied 32 cognitively healthy community-dwelling older adults (age 74 ± 0.3 years) who completed an at-home sleep assessment (Zeo, Inc.) and the PSQI. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the association of the objective sleep parameters (measured by the Zeo) with the PSQI total score and sub-scores, adjusting for age, gender, years of education and likelihood of sleep apnea.Objective sleep parameters did not show any association with the PSQI total score. We found that objective measures of Wake after sleep onset (WASO, % and min) were positively associated with the PSQI sleep disturbance component, while SE and Total Sleep Time (TST) were negatively associated with PSQI sleep disturbance. Lastly, objective SE was positively associated with PSQI SE.Our findings showed that WASO, SE and TST, are associated with PSQI sleep disturbance, where the greater WASO, overall lower SE and less TST, were associated with increased subjective report of sleep disturbance. As expected, subjective (PSQI) and objective measures of SE were related. However, PSQI total score did not relate to any of the objective measures. These results suggest that by focusing on the PSQI total score we may miss the insight this easily administered self-report tool can provide. If interpreted in the right way, the PSQI can provide further insight into cognitively healthy older adults that have the likelihood of objective sleep disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W4283449326,"Many studies have evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women's mental health and menstrual changes. However, most of these studies only included nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, while information on hospitalized women is very limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine the mental health status and menstrual changes in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients.A survey was administered to female COVID-19 patients in the isolation ward of a national referral hospital in Indonesia between January and August 2021, and the women were followed up 3 months after discharge. The survey evaluated menstrual patterns and mental health using the Self Reporting Questionnaire-29 (SRQ-29).The study enrolled 158 female patients. There was an increase in patients who had a cycle length of > 32 or < 24 days, and significant increases in menstrual irregularity and heavy menstrual bleeding were noted. Overall, 37.3% of the patients reported a change in menstrual pattern after infection with COVID-19. Based on SRQ-29 scores, 32.3% of the women had neurotic symptoms, 12.7% had psychotic symptoms, and 38.0% had symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Patients with symptoms of mental health disorders were twice as likely to report a menstrual change (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.12-4.22; p = 0.021).Menstrual changes and increased symptoms of mental health disorders occur in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients. The length of isolation was the key factor affecting overall menstrual changes and mental health in hospitalized female COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283362963,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have advocated numerous social distancing measures, and compliance with these has likely saved millions of lives globally. In an online sample drawn from the U.S. and Canada (N = 209), participants completed measures of political orientation, moral foundations, and COVID-19 social distancing attitudes and behaviours. A more left-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the individualizing moral foundations were significantly related to more positive social distancing attitudes, and greater self-reported compliance with relevant restrictions. A more right-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the binding and economic liberty foundations were associated with less positive attitudes and reduced compliance. In a series of mediation analyses, the relationships between political orientation and various social distancing measures were significantly mediated by variations in participants' moral foundations, particularly their endorsement of economic liberty and the individualizing foundations. Further data indicated that the perceived persuasiveness of messages based on each moral foundation advocating for continued social distancing was significantly related to both participants' moral values and their political orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding politicized differences around social distancing as partly reflecting differential valuation of the moral foundations, and in creating effective public health messaging regarding compliance."
https://openalex.org/W4283381697,"Little is known about the impact of drug-resistance on clinical outcomes among patients with tuberculosis meningitis (TBM).A retrospective cohort study among patients treated for TBM in Tbilisi, Georgia. We performed medical chart abstraction to collect patient data. Long-term vital status was assessed using the Georgia National Death Registry. We utilized a Cox proportional-hazards model to evaluate the association of drug-resistance and mortality.Among 343 TBM suspects, 237 had a presentation consistent with TBM. Drug resistance was suspected (n = 5) or confirmed (n = 31) in 36 patients including 30 with multidrug- or rifampin-resistance and 6 with isoniazid-resistance. Thirty-four patients had HIV. The median follow-up time was 1331 days (IQR, 852-1767). Overall, 73 of 237 (30%) people died with 50 deaths occurring during and 23 after treatment. The proportion of death was higher among patients with drug-resistant vs. drug-susceptible disease (67% vs. 24%, p<0.001) and with HIV versus no HIV (59% vs 27%, p<0.001). Mortality was significantly higher in patients with drug-resistant TBM after 90 days of treatment (aHR = 7.2, CI95% [3.6-14.3], p < 0.001).Mortality was high among patients with drug-resistant TBM with many deaths occurring post treatment. More effective treatment options are urgently needed for drug-resistant TBM."
https://openalex.org/W4283447857,"Endothelial cells form the inner layer of blood vessels, making them the first barrier between the blood and interstitial tissues; thus endothelial cells play a crucial role in inflammation. In the inflammatory response, one important element is the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). While other pro-inflammatory agents like thrombin and histamine induce acute but transient changes in endothelial cells, which have been well studied biologically as well as mechanically, TNF-α is primarily known for its sustained effects on permeability and leukocyte recruitment. These functions are associated with transcriptional changes that take place on the timescale of hours and days. Here, we investigated the early mechanical action of TNF-α and show that even just 4 min after TNF-α was added onto human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers, there was a striking rise in mechanical substrate traction force and internal monolayer tension. These traction forces act primarily at the boundary of the monolayer, as was to be expected. This increased internal monolayer tension may, in addition to TNF-α's other well-studied biochemical responses, provide a mechanical signal for the cells to prepare to recruit leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4283459562,"Air leakage from surface mining-induced fissures can easily cause spontaneous combustion of residual coal in the goaf, which threatens the safe production of the underground working face. In order to study the air leakage law of the goaf under the surface air leakage and the prevention and control technology of spontaneous combustion of residual coal. Based on engineering data from the 6104 working face of the Chuancao Gedan coal mine, this study uses a combination of theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and field observations to study the dynamic distribution characteristics of the air leakage velocity of surface mining-induced fissures in shallow coal seams, the distribution characteristics of relative pressure, the air leakage velocity, the air leakage flow field, the distribution ranges for the ""three zones"" of spontaneous combustion in the goaf, and a reasonable range for the pressurized ventilation of the working face. The results show that there is a quadratic relationship between the air leakage speed from the surface mining-induced fissures in shallow coal seams and the distance from the working face. The air leakage speed decreases as the distance from the working face increases, and the air leakage speed in the middle of the working face is slower than the air leakage on either side of the goaf. The pressure difference between the goaf and the surface mining-induced fissures is the root cause of air leakage into the goaf, and a change in the pressure difference has a significant impact on the air leakage flow field and the distributions of the ""three zones"" of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. When the pressure difference between the ground surface and the working face is maintained within the range of 200~-200 Pa, air leakage is effectively reduced, and the spontaneous combustion of residual coal is inhibited. The research results reveal the air leakage mechanism in the goaf of shallow coal seams and provide a reference for the prevention and control of spontaneous combustion of residual coal in the goaf."
https://openalex.org/W4283466965,"Flood hazards are common in Bhutan as a result of torrential rainfall. Historical flooding events also point to flooding during the main monsoon season of the year, which has had a huge impact in many parts of the country. To account for climate change patterns in flood hazards in Bhutan, 116 historical flood events between 1968 and 2020 for 20 districts were retrieved and reviewed. The preliminary review revealed that the frequency of flood occurrence has increased by three times in recent years. In this study, seven flood vulnerability (FV) indicators were considered. Five are the attributes of historical floods, classified into a number of incidents for flood events, fatalities, affected population, and infrastructure damages including economic losses. Additionally, the highest annual rainfall and existence of a flood map were other two indicators considered. Using historical data, flood hazard and impact zonation were performed. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was employed to derive a multi-criteria decision model. This resulted in priority ranking of the seven FV indicators, broadly classified into social, physical/economic, and environmental. Thereafter, an indicator-based weighted method was used to develop the district flood vulnerability index (DFVI) map of Bhutan. The DFVI map should help researchers understand the flood vulnerability scenarios in Bhutan and use these to mediate flood hazard and risk management. According to the study, FVI is very high in Chhukha, Punakha, Sarpang, and Trashigang districts, and the index ranges between 0.75 to 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W4283399591,"Background and purpose Understanding the relationship of COVID-19 to stroke is important. We compare characteristics of pre-pandemic historical stroke (Pre-C), cases in acute COVID infection (Active-C) and in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection (Post-C). Methods We interrogated the Qatar stroke database for all stroke admissions between Jan 2019 and Feb 2020 (Pre-C) to Active-C (Feb2020-Feb2021) and Post-C to determine how COVID-19 affected ischemic stroke sub-types, clinical course, and outcomes prior to, during and post-pandemic peak. We used the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) to measure outcome at 90-days (mRS 0–2 good recovery and mRS 3–6 as poor recovery). For the current analysis, we compared the clinical features and prognosis in patients with confirmed acute ischemic stroke. Results There were 1413 cases admitted (pre-pandemic: 1324, stroke in COVID-19: 46 and recovered COVID-19 stroke: 43). Patients with Active-C were significantly younger, had more severe symptoms, fever on presentation, more ICU admissions and poor stroke recovery at discharge when compared to Pre-C and Post-C. Large vessel disease and cardioembolic disease was significantly more frequent in Active-C compared to PRE-C or post-C. Conclusions Stroke in Post-C has characteristics similar to Pre-C with no evidence of lasting effects of the virus on the short-term. However, Active-C is a more serious disease and tends to be more severe and have a poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4283453761,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Motor Imagery (MI) training on language comprehension. In line with literature suggesting an intimate relationship between the language and the motor system, we proposed that a MI-training could improve language comprehension by facilitating lexico-semantic access. In two experiments, participants were assigned to a kinesthetic motor-imagery training (KMI) group, in which they had to imagine making upper-limb movements, or to a static visual imagery training (SVI) group, in which they had to mentally visualize pictures of landscapes. Differential impacts of both training protocols on two different language comprehension tasks (i.e., semantic categorization and sentence-picture matching task) were investigated. Experiment 1 showed that KMI training can induce better performance (shorter reaction times) than SVI training for the two language comprehension tasks, thus suggesting that a KMI-based motor activation can facilitate lexico-semantic access after only one training session. Experiment 2 aimed at replicating these results using a pre/post-training language assessment and a longer training period (four training sessions spread over four days). Although the improvement magnitude between pre- and post-training sessions was greater in the KMI group than in the SVI one on the semantic categorization task, the sentence-picture matching task tended to provide an opposite pattern of results. Overall, this series of experiments highlights for the first time that motor imagery can contribute to the improvement of lexical-semantic processing and could open new avenues on rehabilitation methods for language deficits."
https://openalex.org/W4283371462,"Episodic memory is supported by a distributed network of brain regions, and this complex network of regions does not operate in isolation. To date, neuroscience research in this area has typically focused on the activation levels in specific regions or pairwise connectivity between such regions. However, research has yet to investigate how the complex interactions of structural brain networks influence episodic memory abilities. We applied graph theory methods to diffusion-based anatomical networks in order to examine the structural architecture of the medial temporal lobe needed to support effective episodic memory functioning. We examined the relationship between performance on tests of verbal and non-verbal episodic memory with node strength, which indexes how well connected a brain region is in the network. Findings mapped onto the Posterior Medial memory system, subserved by the parahippocampal cortex and overlapped with findings of previous studies of episodic memory employing different methodologies. This expands our current understanding by providing independent evidence for the importance of identified regions and suggesting the particular manner in which these regions support episodic memory."
https://openalex.org/W4283450445,"Boots are often used in sports, occupations, and rehabilitation. However, there are few studies on the biomechanical alterations after wearing boots. The current study aimed to compare the effects of running shoes and boots on running biomechanics. Kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded from 17 healthy males during running at 3.3 m/s with shoe and boot conditions. Temporal distance gait variables, ground reaction force components as well as lower limb joints angle, moment, and power were compared using Paired t-test and Statistical Parametric Mapping package for time-series analysis. Running with boots was associated with greater stride, step, flight, and swing times, greater flight length, and smaller cadence ( p &lt;0.05). The only effect of boots on lower limb joints kinematics during running was a reduction in ankle range of motion ( p &lt;0.05). Significantly greater hip flexor, abductor, and internal rotator moments, greater knee extensor and abductor moments, and ankle plantar flexor moments were observed at push-off phase of running as well as greater ankle dorsiflexor moment at early-stance in boot condition ( p &lt;0.05). Also, knee joint positive power was greater with a significant temporal shift in boot condition, suggesting a compensatory mechanism in response to limited ankle range of motion and the inability of the ankle joint to generate the required power. Our findings showed that running with boots is physically more demanding and is associated with a greater net contribution of muscles spanning hip and knee joints in order to generate more power and compensate for the ankle joint limitations, consequently, may increase the risk of both musculoskeletal injuries and degenerative joint diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4283457153,"This study used metagenomic analysis to investigate the gut microbiota and resistome in piglets that were or were not challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and had or had not received dietary supplementation with microencapsulated probiotics. The 72 piglets belonged to six groups that were either non-ETEC challenged (groups 1-3) or ETEC challenged (receiving 5ml of 109 CFU/ml pathogenic ETEC strain L3.2 one week following weaning at three weeks of age: groups 4-6). On five occasions at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 days of piglet age, groups 2 and 5 were supplemented with 109 CFU/ml of multi-strain probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains 22F and 25F, and Pediococcus acidilactici 72N) while group 4 received 109 CFU/ml of P. acidilactici 72N. Group 3 received 300mg/kg chlortetracycline in the weaner diet to mimic commercial conditions. Rectal faecal samples were obtained for metagenomic and resistome analysis at 2 days of age, and at 12 hours and 14 days after the timing of post-weaning challenge with ETEC. The piglets were all euthanized at 42 days of age. The piglets in groups 2 and 5 were enriched with several desirable microbial families, including Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, while piglets in group 3 had increases in members of the Bacteroidaceae family and exhibited an increase in tetW and tetQ genes. Group 5 had less copper and multi-biocide resistance. Mobile genetic elements IncQ1 and IncX4 were the most prevalent replicons in antibiotic-fed piglets. Only groups 6 and 3 had the integrase gene (intl) class 2 and 3 detected, respectively. The insertion sequence (IS) 1380 was prevalent in group 3. IS3 and IS30, which are connected to dietary intake, were overrepresented in group 5. Furthermore, only group 5 showed genes associated with detoxification, with enrichment of genes associated with oxidative stress, glucose metabolism, and amino acid metabolism compared to the other groups. Overall, metagenomic analysis showed that employing a multi-strain probiotic could transform the gut microbiota, reduce the resistome, and boost genes associated with food metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4283457979,"The partnerships between agricultural cooperatives and development actors play a critical role in meeting development challenges and building cooperative sustainability. The objective of this study was to analyze the key characteristics of engagements established between agricultural cooperatives and other actors and determine their success level. An analytical framework was developed to highlight nine areas, namely partnership configuration, stakeholders, objectives of the partnerships, partnership types, partnership stages, communication methods, achieved outcomes, partnership evaluation, and partnership sustainability. The targets were all agricultural cooperatives building associations with other actors between 2016 and 2020 in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the study covered 69 partnerships founded by 32 agricultural cooperatives. The results revealed that the cooperatives involved in partnerships essentially provide farming inputs and equipment for their stakeholders and capacity building and training purposes. The public sector was the leading actor that collaborated with agricultural cooperatives in inter-sector partnerships. The findings also showed that 55.1% of the partnerships were “strategic partnerships” in cases of both independent value formation and integrative partnerships. By focusing on mapping the partnerships, this study presents beneficial information for policy-makers working on how agricultural cooperatives dealt with the other actors and the lessons gathered to build future sustainability collaborations."
https://openalex.org/W4283461083,"Intensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used. Orally administered antibiotics are well known to cause dysbiosis. To counteract dysbiotic effects, numerous studies in the past two decades sought to understand whether probiotics are a valid tool to help re-establish a healthy gut microbial community after antibiotic treatment. Although dysbiotic effects of antibiotics are well investigated, little is known about the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and a few studies attempted to study treatment effects using phylogenetic diversity analysis techniques. In this study we sought to determine the effects of two probiotic- and one intramuscularly administered antibiotic treatment on the developing gut microbiome of post-weaning piglets between their 3rd and 9th week of life. Shotgun metagenomic sequences from over 800 faecal time-series samples derived from 126 post-weaning piglets and 42 sows were analysed in a phylogenetic framework. Differences between individual hosts such as breed, litter, and age, were found to be important contributors to variation in the community composition. Host age was the dominant factor in shaping the gut microbiota of piglets after weaning. The post-weaning pig gut microbiome appeared to follow a highly structured developmental program with characteristic post-weaning changes that can distinguish hosts that were born as little as two days apart in the second month of life. Treatment effects of the antibiotic and probiotic treatments were found but were subtle and included a higher representation of Mollicutes associated with intramuscular antibiotic treatment, and an increase of Lactobacillus associated with probiotic treatment. The discovery of correlations between experimental factors and microbial community composition is more commonly addressed with OTU-based methods and rarely analysed via phylogenetic diversity measures. The latter method, although less intuitive than the former, suffers less from library size normalization biases, and it proved to be instrumental in this study for the discovery of correlations between microbiome composition and host-, and treatment factors."
https://openalex.org/W4283466350,"Introduction A sexually transmitted virus called the Human Papillomavirus is responsible for more than 99% of cervical cancer cases and its precursors. In 2019, the median survival time of cervical cancer patients at 5 years was 37 months. The survival time and predictors of death from cervical cancer vary in different study settings. This study was aimed to assess the time to death and to identify the major predictors of death of cervical cancer patients in Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods A facility-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 422 randomly selected cervical cancer patients in Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from 25 th June 2017 to 31 st March 2021. Data were extracted from the sampled patient charts by using a structured checklist which was prepared in an English version. Data were coded and then entered, edited, and cleaned using EPI-data 3.1 and exported to STATA14.2 statistical software for analysis. Frequencies and proportions were used to describe the study population with relevant variables and were presented using tables, pie charts, and graphs. Kaplan Meier and life table were used to describe the restricted mean survival time and the overall survival rates. Differences in survival among different variables were compared using the log-rank test. The assumption of proportional hazard was checked using Schoenfeld residual test. Variables having a P-value &gt; 0.05 were considered as fulfilling the assumption. Variables with a significance level below 0.2 in the bivariable Cox regression model were included in a multivariable Cox regression model analysis, where Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval. Model fitness was checked by Cox-Snell residual. Results The mean follow up time of this cohort was 27.66 (CI: 26.96, 28.36) months, and the restricted mean survival time of cervical cancer patients in this study was 40.21 (95% CI: 38.95, 41.47) months. Being FIGO stage IV [AHR = 6.10, 95% CI: 2.18, 16.90)], having adenocarcinoma [AHR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.34, 7.28)], having co-morbidity [AHR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.29, 5.11)], and being initiated with radiotherapy [AHR = 4.57, 95% CI: 1.60, 13.06)] were a significant predictors of death from cervical cancer. Conclusion The restricted mean survival time of cervical cancer patients in this study was 40.21 months. Marital status, type of tumor histology, stage of disease, type of treatment initiated, and presence of co-morbidity were significant predictors of death for cervical cancer. Treatment of comorbidities in the early stage of cervical cancer plays a key role in maximizing the survival time of cervical cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W4283383368,"With the increasing demand for quality control in the traditional Chinese medicine industry, there is a need for the development of quality markers and a quick, non-destructive technique for the discrimination of related species. In our previous study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was used for the simultaneous determination of five compounds, including three alkaloids (nitidine chloride, chelerythrine, and magnoflorine), one flavonoid (aurantiamarin), and one lignan (sesamin). In this study, the simultaneous quantification of the above-mentioned compounds could be used to discriminate the powders of roots from those of stems. To further test the reliability of the five compounds, seventy-two batches of wild and seventy-five batches of cultivated Zanthoxylum nitidum samples collected from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces in China were analyzed by UPLC and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In general, the quantitative results of UPLC were consistent with those of NIRS, and cultivated Z. nitidum has similar major bioactive compounds as the wild one, as supported by principal component analysis. Consequently, these five major bioactive compounds are suggested as potential quality markers. In addition, the NIRS method with discriminant analysis successfully differentiated Z. nitidum from three related species (Z. avicennae, Z. scandens and Toddalia asiatica) of the Rutaceae family. In summary, this study provides a method for the rapid identification of Z. nitidum and discrimination of root and stem powders, and suggests five compounds as quality markers for the evaluation of Z. nitidum."
https://openalex.org/W4283361338,"Background Viral suppression among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is essential for protecting health and preventing HIV transmission, yet globally, rates of viral suppression are sub-optimal. Interventions to improve HIV prevention and care cascade outcomes remain vital. Financial incentives hold promise for improving these outcomes, yet to date, clinical trial results have been mixed. Methods This qualitative sub-study, embedded in a trial (NCT02890459) in Uganda to test whether incentives are effective for achieving viral suppression in PLHIV, sought to enhance our understanding of the factors that influence this outcome. Forty-nine (n = 49) PLHIV, purposely sampled to balance across gender, study arm, and viral suppression status, were interviewed to explore barriers and motivations for care engagement, adherence, and viral suppression, and attributions for decision-making, including perceived influence of incentives on behaviors. Results While many participants with undetectable viral load (VL) who received incentives said the incentives motivated their ART adherence, others expressed intrinsic motivation for adherence. All felt that incentives reduced burdens of transport costs, lost income due to time spent away from work, and food insecurity. Incentives may have activated attention and memory for some, as excitement about anticipating incentives helped them adhere to medication schedules. In comparison, participants who were randomized to receive incentives but had detectable VL faced a wider range, complexity and severity of challenges to care engagement. Notably, their narratives included more accounts of poor treatment in clinics, food insecurity, and severe forms of stigma. With or without incentives, adherence was reinforced through experiencing restored health due to ART, social support (especially from partners), and good quality counseling and clinical care. Conclusions In considering why incentives sometimes fail to achieve behavior change, it may be helpful to attend to the full set of factors- psychological, interpersonal, social and structural- that militate against the behavior change required to achieve behavioral outcomes. To be effective, incentives may need to be combined with other interventions to address the spectrum of barriers to care engagement."
https://openalex.org/W4283365328,"Background Globally, obstructed labour accounted for 22% of maternal morbidities and up to 70% of perinatal deaths. It is one of the most common preventable causes of maternal and perinatal mortality in low-income countries. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of obstructed labor in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess determinants and outcomes of obstructed labor among women who gave birth in Hawassa University Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods A hospital-based case-control study design was conducted in Hawassa University Hospital among 468 women. All women who were diagnosed with obstructed labour and two consecutive controls giving birth on the same day were enrolled in this study. A pretested data extraction tool was used for data collection from the patient charts. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to identify determinants of obstructed labor. Results A total of 156 cases and 312 controls were included with an overall response rate of 96.3%. Women who were primipara [AOR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07, 0.52] and multigravida [AOR 0.17; 95% CI 0.07, 0.41] had lower odds of obstructed labour. While contracted pelvis [AOR 3.98; 95% CI 1.68, 9.42], no partograph utilization [AOR 5.19; 95% CI 1.98, 13.6], duration of labour above 24 hours [AOR 7.61; 95% CI 2.98, 19.8] and estimated distance of 10 to 50 kilometers from the hospital [AOR 3.89; 95% CI 1.14, 13.3] had higher odds. Higher percentage of maternal (65.2%) and perinatal (60%) complications occurred among cases (p-value &lt; 0.05). Obstructed labour accounted for 8.3% of maternal deaths and 39.7% of stillbirth. Uterine rupture, post-partum haemorrhage and sepsis were the common adverse outcomes among cases. Conclusion Parity, contracted pelvis, non-partograph utilization, longer duration of labour and longer distance from health facilities were determinants of obstructed labour. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality due to obstructed labour are higher. Therefore, improvement of partograph utilization to identify complications early, birth preparedness, complication readiness and provision of timely interventions are recommended to prevent such complications."
https://openalex.org/W4283377615,"Magnesium (Mg) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Physiological and transcriptome analyses were conducted to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms to long-term Mg deficiency (MD) in banana seedlings at the 6-leaf stage. Banana seedlings were irrigated with a Mg-free nutrient solution for 42 days, and a mock control was treated with an optimum Mg supply. Leaf edge chlorosis was observed on the 9th leaf, which gradually turned yellow from the edge to the interior region. Accordingly, the total chlorophyll content was reduced by 47.1%, 47.4%, and 53.8% in the interior, center and edge regions, respectively, and the net photosynthetic rate was significantly decreased in the 9th leaf. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MD induced 9,314, 7,425 and 5,716 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the interior, center and edge regions, respectively. Of these, the chlorophyll metabolism pathway was preferentially enriched according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. The expression levels of the five candidate genes in leaves were consistent with what is expected during chlorophyll metabolism. Our results suggest that changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll synthesis and decomposition result in the yellowing of banana seedling leaves, and these results are helpful for understanding the banana response mechanism to long-term MD."
https://openalex.org/W4283385569,"Over the past decade, there has been an apparent increased frequency and widened distribution of canine leptospirosis in Canada, however, this has been minimally investigated. Availability and clinical uptake of Leptospira polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing of dogs in Canada may provide important insight into the epidemiology of this canine and zoonotic infectious disease. Study objectives were to evaluate clinical canine Leptospira PCR test results from a large commercial laboratory to determine temporal and spatial distribution in Canada and identify dog, geographic and temporal risk factors for test-positive dogs. This cross-sectional study analyzed data obtained from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. on 10,437 canine Leptospira PCR tests (blood and/or urine) submitted by Canada-based veterinarians (July 2009 to May 2018). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for test-positive dogs. Test-positive proportion varied widely annually (4.8–14.0%) and by location. Provinces with the highest test-positive proportion over the study period were Nova Scotia (18.5%) and Ontario (9.6%), with the prairie provinces (Manitoba and Alberta combined) having the lowest proportion (1.0%); the northern territories could not be evaluated due to limited testing. In the final model, dog age, sex, breed, month, and year test performed, and location (urban/rural, province) of the practice submitting the sample were significant predictors of a positive Leptospira PCR test. Dogs less than one year of age (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.6–2.9), male sex (OR = 1.3; 1.1–1.5), toy breed (OR = 3.3; 2.5–4.4), and samples submitted from an urban practice (OR = 1.3; 1.0–1.8) had the greatest odds of a positive Leptospira PCR test as compared to referent groups. Significant two-way interactions between province-month and year-month highlight the complex spatial and temporal influences on leptospirosis occurrence in this region. Our work suggests a high incidence of canine leptospirosis regionally within Canada. Identifiable dog and location factors may assist in future targeted prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W4283386108,"Background The effect of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on T1-2N1M0 triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) remains unclear. The population-based study aimed to investigate the survival outcomes of T1-2N1M0 TNBC patients who underwent PMRT or not. Methods We selected 1743 patients with T1-2N1M0 TNBC who underwent mastectomy between 2010 and 2015 through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. After propensity score matching (PSM), the PMRT and no-PMRT groups consisted of 586 matched patients, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to calculate breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the prognostic factors of T1-2N1M0 TNBC. Results The 5-year BCSS for the PMRT and no-PMRT groups was 79.1% and 74.7%, respectively. Analysis showed that in patients with three nodes positive, radiotherapy could significantly improve BCSS (HR = 0.396, 95% CI = 0.175–0.900, P = 0.027), but it brought no significant advantage in BCSS in patients with one or two nodes positive (HR = 1.061, 95% CI = 0.725–1.552, P = 0.761; HR = 0.657, 95% CI = 0.405–1.065, P = 0.088). In addition, PMRT improves the BCSS in TNBC patients with T2 tumor concomitant with three positive lymph nodes (HR = 0.343, 95% CI = 0.132–0.890, P = 0.028). Conclusion TNBC patients with T2 tumor concomitant with three positive lymph nodes can benefit from PMRT."
https://openalex.org/W4283393273,"The pig industry occupies an extremely significant position in agriculture. The input cost, output income and the amount of pollution emitted by pig farming of different scales are unequal. It is of great practical importance to reduce pollutant emission by improving efficiency for the development of hog breeding industry in China. With the addition of undesirable output, this paper uses the Slack Based Measure- Metafrontier Malmquist Luenberger index model considering scale heterogeneity to explore the evolution characteristics of China's green total factor productivity of pig breeding (GTPB) based on the data of China's 17 major pig producing provinces from 2004 to 2018. The results indicate that: (1) From 2004 to 2018, China's large-scale GTPB is the highest, the medium-sized is the second, and the small-scale is the lowest. (2) In terms of regional distribution, China's GTPB in western region is the highest, in eastern region is the second, and in central region is the lowest. (3) China's GTPB shows efficiency growth and technological decline from 2004 to 2018. The pig breeding industry is generally fragile, which is greatly affected by emergencies. (4)The TGR of large-scale pig breeding is closest to 1, followed by middle-scale, and finally small-scale. According to the above empirical results, this text puts forward some policy suggestions to improve GTPB and environmental protection recommendations of hog breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4283398655,"This study examined associations between cumulative training load, travel demands and recovery days with athlete-reported outcome measures (AROMs) and countermovement jump (CMJ) performance in professional basketball. Retrospective analysis was performed on data collected from 23 players (mean±SD: age = 24.7±2.5 years, height = 198.3±7.6 cm, body mass = 98.1±9.0 kg, wingspan = 206.8±8.4 cm) from 2018-2020 in the National Basketball Association G-League. Linear mixed models were used to describe variation in AROMs and CMJ data in relation to cumulative training load (previous 3- and 10-days), hours travelled (previous 3- and 10-day), days away from the team's home city, recovery days (i.e., no travel/minimal on-court activity) and individual factors (e.g., age, fatigue, soreness). Cumulative 3-day training load had negative associations with fatigue, soreness, and sleep, while increased recovery days were associated with improved soreness scores. Increases in hours travelled and days spent away from home over 10 days were associated with increased sleep quality and duration. Cumulative training load over 3 and 10 days, hours travelled and days away from home city were all associated with changes in CMJ performance during the eccentric phase. The interaction of on-court and travel related stressors combined with individual factors is complex, meaning that multiple athletes response measures are needed to understand fatigue and recovery cycles. Our findings support the utility of the response measures presented (i.e., CMJ and AROMs), but this is not an exhaustive battery and practitioners should consider what measures may best inform training periodization within the context of their environment/sport."
https://openalex.org/W4283463878,"Maternal weight management services have been recognised as a good opportunity to influence lifestyle and dietary behaviour of mothers and families. Exploring women's views of maternal weight management services is paramount to understand what constitutes the most suitable service. This study therefore explored experiences among women with a raised body mass index (BMI) of maternal weight management service provision and the barriers and facilitators to weight management during pregnancy.Thirteen women with a BMI≥40kg/m² undertook semi-structured interviews around weight management experiences during pregnancy. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis was undertaken.Four themes emerged. 1). ""Understanding where I am at"" showed current readiness and motivation of women varied, from being avoidant to being motivated to make changes. 2). ""Getting information"" revealed inconsistent information provision during pregnancy. Women particularly wanted practical advice. Some attempted to find this for themselves from friends or the internet, however this left some women feeling confused when different sources provided inconsistent advice. 3). ""Difficulties I face"" identified physical, emotional and financial barriers and the strategies some women used to overcome these. 4). ""Encountering professionals-a mixed experience"" demonstrated women wanted to be treated with respect and sensitivity and that how weight management information was addressed was more important than who provided it. The fine line professionals tread was demonstrated by women thinking that they had received inadequate information and yet too much focus was placed on their weight and the associated risks during pregnancy without practical solutions to their weight management challenges.Women were empowered when practical advice was provided, not just the continual repetition of the risks of being obese during pregnancy. Antenatal weight management services need to be clear, sensitive and respectful. Services centred on individual women's needs and on their current and previous experiences are required. The psychological and social contexts of weight management also need to be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W4283464398,"Depression is a major public health problem among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. It compromises patient outcomes, resulting in higher rates of mortality. Currently, there are little data on the prevalence of depression in Sub-Sharan countries. Therefore, the current study was done to assess the prevalence of depression among adult cancer patients and its associated factors in Ethiopia.An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 adult cancer patients from 1st March to April 30, 2021. Systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The collected data were coded and entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Bivariate binary logistic regression was performed to select factors that will be included in multivariate analysis, and variables with a p-value < 0.05 were included in multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were computed and variables with p-value < 0.05 were considered to declare a significant association.In this study, the prevalence of depression was 33.1% (95% CI = 0.2858, 0.3761). Minimal symptoms of depression, minor depression, moderate depression, moderate severe depression, and severe depression were found to be 272 (64.8%), 9 (2.1%), 104 (24.8%), 28 (6.7%), and 7 (1.7%), respectively. Those cancer patients who had unemployed status, sacked from jobs, and had stage IV cancer were most likely to develop depression, whereas patients who completed primary education, colon, prostate and cervical cancer were less likely to have depression.Depression is found to be a major public health concern for adult cancer patients in Ethiopia. To reduce the occurrence of depression among cancer patients, special attention is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4283464536,"Herein we report the use of Chaperonin-Containing TCP-1 (CCT or TRiC) as a marker to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that are shed from tumors during oncogenesis. Most detection methods used in liquid biopsy approaches for enumeration of CTCs from blood, employ epithelial markers like cytokeratin (CK). However, such markers provide little information on the potential of these shed tumor cells, which are normally short-lived, to seed metastatic sites. To identify a marker that could go beyond enumeration and provide actionable data on CTCs, we evaluated CCT. CCT is a protein-folding complex composed of eight subunits. Previously, we found that expression of the second subunit (CCT2 or CCTβ) inversely correlated with cancer patient survival and was essential for tumorigenesis in mice, driving tumor-promoting processes like proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. In this study, we examined CCT2 expression in cancer compared to normal tissues and found statistically significant increases in tumors. Because not all blood samples from cancer patients contain detectable CTCs, we used the approach of spiking a known number of cancer cells into blood from healthy donors to test a liquid biopsy approach using CCT2 to distinguish rare cancer cells from the large number of non-cancer cells in blood. Using a clinically validated method for capturing CTCs, we evaluated detection of intracellular CCT2 staining for visualization of breast cancer and small cell lung (SCLC) cancer cells. We demonstrated that CCT2 staining could be incorporated into a CTC capture and staining protocol, providing biologically relevant information to improve detection of cancer cells shed in blood. These results were confirmed with a pilot study of blood from SCLC patients. Our studies demonstrate that detection of CCT2 could identify rare cancer cells in blood and has application in liquid biopsy approaches to enhance the use of minimally invasive methods for cancer diagnosis."

VIP3Aa, a class of insecticidal protein with different receptor binding site in the insect’s midgut compared to Bt -crystal protein, offers an alternative protection strategy against Lepidopteran insects. Here, we report evaluation of genetically engineered chickpea lines harboring codon modified Vip3Aa (cm Vip3Aa ) against the Lepidopteran insect pest, gram pod borer. The synthetic codon modified, cm Vip3Aa gene of 2,370 bp was sub-cloned in modified plant expression vector and used for direct transformation of embryonic axis explants of chickpea ( cv . DCP 92–3), with transformation efficiency of 4.30%. Presence and transmission of transgene across two generations were confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses in the five selected transgenic chickpea lines. Real Time PCR analyses indicated variable levels of cm Vip3Aa expression in the transgenic chickpea lines (average Cq values 15.01±0.86 to 19.32±0.10), which were absent in the non-transgenic counterpart. Detached leaf insect bioassay indicate larval mortality (up to 39.75%), reduced larval feeding (up to 82.91%) and reduced larval weight gain (up to 68.23%), compared to control lines. Evaluation of gene offers a platform to identify efficacious insecticidal gene that can be used for insect resistance management in chickpea."
https://openalex.org/W4283373553,"Introduction Inflammatory bowel disease is a relapsing chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a rare but serious extraintestinal pulmonary manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. However, the relationship between these two conditions is unclear. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate this relationship through a systematic review and meta-analysis, focusing on the risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Methods The systematic review will be outlined according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols and its extension statement for reporting systematic reviews incorporating network meta-analyses of healthcare interventions: checklist and explanations. Original articles published in any language will be searched in the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Ovid. Observational studies that reveal an association measure between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease will be included (cross sectional, cohort, and case-control trials). Two independent reviewers will be assigned to evaluate study quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies in meta-analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted based on the quality of included studies. All relevant studies will be assessed based on the study type, sample size, inflammatory bowel disease subtype, odds ratio, confidence interval, treatment strategy, and follow-up. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach will be used to rate the quality of the evidence. Discussion The results of this meta-analysis may show that patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This study will be the first meta-analysis to focus on the association between inflammatory bowel disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Exploring the relationship between the two conditions may further enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and promote the development of related research fields."

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship, if any, between individual votes and Panel recommendations and: (1) the composition of Panels, specifically the expertise and demographic features of individual members; or (2) Panel members' propensity to speak during Panel deliberations.This was a retrospective cohort study of routinely collected data from voting members of MDAC panels convened between January 2011 to June 2016 to consider premarket approval. Data sources were verbatim transcripts available publicly from the FDA. Number of words spoken, directionality of votes on device approval, profession, and demographics were collected.658,954 words spoken by 536 members during 49 meetings of 11 Panels were analyzed. Based on multivariate analysis, biostatisticians spoke more (+373 words; P = 0.0002), and women (-187 words; P = 0.0184) and other non-physician voting members less (-213 words; P = 0.0306), than physicians. Speaking more was associated with abstaining (P = 0.0179), and with voting against the majority (P = 0.0153). Non-physician, non-biostatistician members (P = 0.0109), and those having attended more meetings as a voting member (P = 0.0249) were more likely to vote against approval. In bivariable analysis, unanimous Panels had a greater proportion of biostatisticians (mean 0.1580; 95% CI 0.1237-0.1923) than non-unanimous Panels (0.1107; 95% CI 0.0912-0.1301; p = 0.0201).Panelists likely to vote against the majority include non-physician, non-biostatisticians; experienced Panelists; and more talkative members. The increased presence of biostatisticians on Panels leads to greater voting consensus. Having a diversity of opinions on Panels, including in sufficient numbers those members likely to dissent from majority views, may help ensure that a diversity of opinions are aired before decision-making."

However, the developing relations between mathematical skills, language, and working memory starting at preschool age and evolving into primary school age are not well understood. Adopting an empirically validated analysis model, the present study examines in detail longitudinal interdependencies between mathematical skills, a wide range of language skills, and working memory components underlying the mathematical learning process of 41 German preschool children (41.5% female) spanning ages 4 to 6. Phonological processing skills and expressive grammar skills emerged as the most significant language skills for the process of children's mathematical learning across the investigated age span. Within the latter, children's phonological processing skills and expressive grammar skills were supported by children's word expression abilities. The phonological loop emerged as the most important working memory component for children's early mathematical learning between ages 4 to 6. Furthermore, a wide array of language skills were associated with complex information and storage processes within this mathematical learning process. In conclusion, the present findings provide a more detailed and deeper insight into the learning process of children's number concept, emphasizing the influence of phonological and particularly grammatical skills."
https://openalex.org/W4283452898,"Numerical simulation is very important to solve geotechnical problems. However, it is difficult to obtain required comprehensive and accurate information such as parameters, boundary conditions, and etc. In this paper, a grey distributed parameter model, which integrates the finite element method (FEM) with the grey system theory, was proposed to address the issue. The analysis of grey properties on rock and soil system was performed. The equilibrium equations, geometric equations, physics equations and related differential equations were obtained, each of the equations contains grey parameters and variables. And the discretization and solution methods of the FEM with the grey variables were discussed. An example of deep-buried circular mining tunnel was applied to test the proposed model. The calculation results were compared with those of the exact solution (analytical solution) and the classical FEM, respectively, through which the rationality of the proposed model was demonstrated. For the first time, grey variables and grey parameters are defined in geotechnical numerical simulation. The expressions of basic equations with grey variables are given respectively. A grey distributed parameter model which integrates the FEM with the grey system theory is proposed to solve geotechnical problems, and the optimal solution to the proposed model is determined through calculation and comparison of an application example. The proposed numerical model with grey variables not only has the advantage of grey system theory, but also greatly improves the adaptability and application effect of the model, which contributes to the prediction and evaluation problems in geological engineering, geotechnical engineering, water conservancy engineering and civil engineering with complex structures."

Although TOS is a minimally invasive procedure, postoperative complications, such as postoperative dysphagia, may occur, which can lead to a poor quality of life for patients undergoing TOS. This study aimed to investigate factors that may affect swallowing function in patients who underwent TOS for laryngopharyngeal cancers. Swallowing function of 84 patients who underwent endoscopic resection for oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and supraglottic lesions was evaluated by the Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale, and predictors for postoperative dysphagia were identified. Multivariate analysis identified the following factors as independent predictors for postoperative dysphagia: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS, p = 0.008), prior neck radiation therapy (p = 0.008), and operative time (p = 0.021). This study suggests that patients with poor ECOG PS or those who received prior neck radiation therapy should be fully assessed for preoperative swallowing function. In the future, we would like to clarify the criteria for preoperative swallowing evaluation to create a system that can identify patients suitable for TOS."
https://openalex.org/W4283462352,"Fruit extracts of Momordica charantia L. (Cucurbitaceae) and Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench (Malvaceae) have shown promising antidiabetic activities in clinical trials. However, they remain underutilized due to insufficient standardization and lack of formulation containing their mixture. This study’s overall purpose was to develop and optimize a capsule dosage form containing dried fruit extracts of M . charantia and A . esculentus . The design of the experiment involved two steps; first, response surface methodology (RSM) with a five-level two-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to determine the optimal dose of a mixture of extracts for adequate glycemic control. The extract of M . charantia and A . esculentus were the independent variables while fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was the dependent factor. In the second step, a D-optimal mixture design was applied to study the interaction effect of the optimal dose and selected excipients on granules flowability and capsules’ disintegration time. Moreover, a second-order quadratic model determined the interrelationship of excipients and the desired capsules’ quality attributes. The validity of the predicted models was confirmed. The findings indicated that a combined dose of 175 A . esculentus and 281 M . charantia (mg/kg) significantly reduced the FPG level compared to vehicle at day 14 (mean difference -2.7 ± 0.21, p &lt; 0.001). This dose was used to make a 600 mg capsule (DM083) with 76% drug loading. The DM083 had 40.4 ± 0.62 mg GAE/gDW total polyphenols, 12 peaks HPLC fingerprint, and 26.6 ± 4.75 min average disintegration time. Together, these findings showed that a mixture of M . charantia and A . esculentus fruit extracts could be formulated in a stable capsule dosage form with acceptable quality standards. Further biological studies such as toxicity assays and long-term efficacy studies of the developed capsules could be carried out before large-scale commercial production."
https://openalex.org/W4283363443,"Measuring joint kinematics is a key requirement for a plethora of biomechanical research and applications. While x-ray based systems avoid the soft-tissue artefacts arising in skin-based measurement systems, extracting the object’s pose (translation and rotation) from the x-ray images is a time-consuming and expensive task. Based on about 106’000 annotated images of knee implants, collected over the last decade with our moving fluoroscope during activities of daily living, we trained a deep-learning model to automatically estimate the 6D poses for the femoral and tibial implant components. By pretraining a single stage of our architecture using renderings of the implant geometries, our approach offers personalised predictions of the implant poses, even for unseen subjects. Our approach predicted the pose of both implant components better than about 0.75 mm (in-plane translation), 25 mm (out-of-plane translation), and 2° (all Euler-angle rotations) over 50% of the test samples. When evaluating over 90% of test samples, which included heavy occlusions and low contrast images, translation performance was better than 1.5 mm (in-plane) and 30 mm (out-of-plane), while rotations were predicted better than 3−4°. Importantly, this approach now allows for pose estimation in a fully automated manner."

The type strain of the bacterium, ATCC 35405, is commonly used in a basic research. Here, we report that our stock strain derived from ATCC 35405 had a mutation on the chromosome and expressed differential characteristics from the original strain. Genome sequencing analysis revealed the lack of a phage-derived region, and over 200 mutations in the mutant strain. The mutant grew to a higher density in broth culture as compared with the origin. In addition, the mutant formed a colony on the surface of the agar medium, whereas the origin could not. On contrary, the mutant showed decreased motility and adhesion to gingival epithelial cells. There were no differences in the bacterial cell length and a chymotrypsin-like protease activity between the two strains. RNA and genome sequencing analysis could not identify the genes that introduced the phenotypic differences between the strains. This mutant is potentially useful for examining the genetic background responsible for the physiological and pathogenic characteristics of T. denticola."
https://openalex.org/W4283373656,"In Mandarin Chinese, an important manifestation of respectfulness is the use of different forms of second-person pronouns. Jiang et al. (2013) examined the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of processing respectful and plain pronouns in Chinese. However, this study suffered from a few methodological limitations, which restricted both the reliability and functional interpretations of the study’s findings. In the present study, we resolved these limitations and further investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms of processing the respectfulness of pronouns. In the present study, participants read 160 critical Chinese sentences with a second-person pronoun ( ni or nin ) that was either consistent or inconsistent with its prior sentence context in terms of respectfulness, as well as 240 filler sentences. Unlike the previous study that reported a 300–500 ms negative response (N400) for both types of inconsistent pronouns, a sustained positive response for Nin inconsistent and a sustained negativity response for Ni inconsistent in the late time window, the present study found an N400 response and late sustained negativity for Nin inconsistent, but not for Ni inconsistent. Furthermore, the cluster-based permutation showed a significant negative cluster for Nin inconsistent, extending from 432–622 ms. We related this negative response for Nin inconsistent with recent accounts of the N400 and late negativity. Finally, the absence of the ERP effect for the Ni condition was linked to the role of the pragmatic property of Ni."
https://openalex.org/W4283380790,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of liver-related death worldwide, particularly in Asia. Patients with either current or past HBV infection are at risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the HBV seroprevalence in residents of southern Thailand born before the national vaccination program.A cross-sectional study of individuals born before the nationwide HBV vaccination program who sought check-up programs which included HBV serology and abdominal ultrasound at a tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand from 2019 to 2020 was conducted. HBV serology, cirrhosis and liver fibrosis status (determined by ultrasonography and FIB-4), and clinical notes regarding management following HBsAg+ detection were obtained.Of 1,690 eligible individuals, the overall prevalence of HBsAg+ and HBsAg-antiHBc+, indicating current and past HBV infections, were 2.9% and 27.8%, respectively. Among current HBV patients, 87.8% were unaware of their infection. Cirrhosis was found in 8.2%, 1.1%, and 0.3% of patients with current, past, and no HBV infection, respectively (p<0.001). One-fourth of past HBV patients had FIB-4≥1.45, which indicated indeterminate or significant liver fibrosis, which may increase the risk of HCC.The prevalence of HBsAg+ in Southern Thailand was 2.9%, and that of past infection (HBsAg-antiHBc+) was 27.8%. Patients with current and past HBV infection have an increased risk of cirrhosis and significant liver fibrosis. Most current HBV patients were unaware of their infection. Identifying patients with current and past HBV infection who are at risk for HCC and linking them to a cascade of care is necessary to reduce the burden of HBV-related liver diseases in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W4283381827,"Supplemental oxygen is widely administered in trauma patients, often leading to hyperoxia. However, the clinical evidence for providing supplemental oxygen in all trauma patients is scarce, and hyperoxia has been found to increase mortality in some patient populations. Hypovolemia is a common finding in trauma patients, which affects many hemodynamic parameters, but little is known about how supplemental oxygen affects systemic and cerebral hemodynamics during hypovolemia. We therefore plan to conduct an experimental, randomized, double blinded crossover study to investigate the effect of 100% oxygen compared to room air delivered by a face mask with reservoir on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics during simulated hypovolemia in the lower body negative pressure model in 15 healthy volunteers. We will measure cardiac output, stroke volume, blood pressure, middle cerebral artery velocity and tolerance to hypovolemia continuously in all subjects at two visits to investigate whether oxygen affects the cardiovascular response to simulated hypovolemia. The effect of oxygen on the outcome variables will be analyzed with mixed linear regression. Trial registration: The study is registered in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT, registration number 2021-003238-35)."
https://openalex.org/W4283452726,"Background Urban renewal traditionally involves policy sectors such as housing, transport, and employment, which potentially can enhance the health of residents living in deprived areas. Additional involvement of the public health sector might increase the health impact of these urban renewal activities. This study evaluates the health impact of an additional focus on health, under the heading of Healthy District Experiments (HDE), within districts where an urban renewal programme was carried out. Methods We evaluated changes in health outcomes before the start of the HDE and after implementation, and compared these changes with health changes in control areas, e.g. districts from the urban renewal programme where no additional HDE was implemented. Additionally, we gathered information on the content of the experiments to determine what types of activities have been implemented. Results The additional activities from the HDE were mostly aimed at strengthening the health care in the districts and at promoting physical activity. When we compared the prevalence in general health, mental health, overweight, obesity, smoking, and physical activity during the study period between the HDE districts and control districts, we found no significant differences in the rate of change. The study is limited by a small sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the data. These and other limitations are discussed. Conclusion We found no evidence for a beneficial health impact of the activities that were initiated with a specific focus on health, within a Dutch urban renewal programme. Specific attention for network management and the integration of such activities in the wider programme, as well as an allocated budget might be needed in order to sort a health impact."
https://openalex.org/W4283455113,"Immunoglobulin-like Domain-Containing Receptor 1 (ILDR1) is expressed on nutrient sensing cholecystokinin-positive enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and it has the unique ability to induce fat-mediated CCK secretion. However, the role of ILDR1 in CCK-mediated regulation of satiety is unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of ILDR1 on food intake and metabolic activity using mice with genetically-deleted Ildr1.The expression of ILDR1 in murine tissues and the measurement of adipocyte cell size were evaluated by light and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The effects of Ildr1 deletion on mouse metabolism were quantitated using CLAMS chambers and by targeted metabolomics assays of multiple tissues. Hormone levels were measured by ELISA. The effects of Ildr1 gene deletion on glucose and insulin levels were determined using in vivo oral glucose tolerance, meal tolerance, and insulin tolerance tests, as well as ex vivo islet perifusion.ILDR1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues. Analysis of metabolic data revealed that although Ildr1-/- mice consumed more food than wild-type littermates, they gained less weight on a high fat diet and exhibited increased metabolic activity. Adipocytes in Ildr1-/- mice were significantly smaller than in wild-type mice fed either low or high fat diets. ILDR1 was expressed in both alpha and beta cells of pancreatic islets. Based on oral glucose and mixed meal tolerance tests, Ildr1-/- mice were more effective at lowering post-prandial glucose levels, had improved insulin sensitivity, and glucose-regulated insulin secretion was enhanced in mice lacking ILDR1.Ildr1 loss significantly modified metabolic activity in these mutant mice. While Ildr1 gene deletion increased high fat food intake, it reduced weight gain and improved glucose tolerance. These findings indicate that ILDR1 modulates metabolic responses to feeding in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4283455585,"Geographic patterns of cultural variations are affected by how cultural traits are transmitted within and between populations. It has been argued that cultural traits are transmitted in different manners depending on their characteristics; for example, words for basic concepts are less liable to horizontal transmission between populations (i.e., borrowing) than other words. Here we examine the geographic variation of traditional songs in the Ryukyu Archipelago, southwestern islands of Japan, to explore cultural evolution of music with a focus on different social contexts in which songs are sung. Published scores of 1,342 traditional songs are coded using the CantoCore song classification scheme and distances between the songs are calculated from the codings. Neighbor-Net graphs of regions/islands are generated on the basis of the musical distances, and delta scores are obtained to examine the treelikeness of the networks. We also perform analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to evaluate the extent of musical diversification among regions/islands. Our results suggest that horizontal transmission between populations has played a greater role in the formation of musical diversity than that of linguistic diversity in the Ryukyu Archipelago and that the social context in which songs are sung has an effect on how they are transmitted within and between populations. In addition, we compare the observed patterns of song diversity among regions/islands with those of lexical and mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) diversity, showing that the variation of songs sung in the ""work"" context are associated with the linguistic variation, whereas no association is found between the musical and genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W4283459584,"Three-dimensional tracking of cells is one of the most powerful methods to investigate multicellular phenomena, such as ontogenesis, tumor formation or wound healing. However, 3D tracking in a biological environment usually requires fluorescent labeling of the cells and elaborate equipment, such as automated light sheet or confocal microscopy. Here we present a simple method for 3D tracking large numbers of unlabeled cells in a collagen matrix. Using a small lensless imaging setup, consisting of an LED and a photo sensor only, we were able to simultaneously track ~3000 human neutrophil granulocytes in a collagen droplet within an unusually large field of view (>50 mm2) at a time resolution of 4 seconds and a spatial resolution of ~1.5 μm in xy- and ~30 μm in z-direction. The setup, which is small enough to fit into any conventional incubator, was used to investigate chemotaxis towards interleukin-8 (IL-8 or CXCL8) and N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). The influence of varying stiffness and pore size of the embedding collagen matrix could also be quantified. Furthermore, we demonstrate our setup to be capable of telling apart healthy neutrophils from those where a condition of inflammation was (I) induced by exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (II) caused by a pre-existing asthma condition. Over the course of our experiments we have tracked more than 420.000 cells. The large cell numbers increase statistical relevance to not only quantify cellular behavior in research, but to make it suitable for future diagnostic applications, too."
https://openalex.org/W4283461147,"Mitochondria and the energy metabolism are linked to both, the availability of Ca and P to provide the eukaryotic cell with energy. Both minerals are commonly used supplements in the feed of laying hens but little is known about the relationship between the feed content, energy metabolism and genetic background. In this study, we provide a large-scaled gene expression analysis of 31 mitochondrial and nuclear encoded genes in 80 laying hens in the context of dietary P and Ca concentrations. The setup included five tissues and gene expression was analysed under four different diets of recommended and reduced Ca and P concentrations. Our study shows, that mitochondrial gene expression is reacting to a reduction in P and that an imbalance of the nutrients has a higher impact than a combined reduction. The results suggest, that both strains (Lohmann Brown and Lohmann Selected Leghorn) react in a similar way to the changes and that a reduction of both nutrients might be possible without crucial influence on the animals' health or gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W4283462267,"Most countries around the world use the penalties' system in order to increase compliance with road traffic rules. However, it can be argued that the most penalties' systems are ineffective, as drivers do not change offending behavior due to received penalty and repeatedly violate them. The perceived fairness of these penalties may be related to the level of adherence to these traffic rules. Therefore, this research explored the perceived justice of penalties for road traffic rules in a sample of Lithuanian drivers and investigated the differences between offenders and non-offenders. The sample consisted of 358 participants (63.4 percent females, aged 18-75, mean age 35.2 years) who completed an online survey. Participants were asked to report how fair they believed penalties were for road traffic rule offences in general and using a list of 23 specific penalties, including: drink driving, speeding, dangerous maneuverings, illegal overtaking, handheld phone use while driving, etc. The survey measured demographic data, as well as data regarding driving exposure, traffic offences and crashes during the last 12 months. The results revealed that in general drivers perceived the penalties as fair or adequate. The answer ""adequate/fair"" was chosen most frequently for almost all penalties (from 41.1 to 71.3 percent), with only the penalty for carrying a child without a car seat (€30-50) being perceived as too mild (55.5%). Gender differences were found in the evaluation of the penalty for driving under the influence of alcohol, while age and driving frequency differences were found in the perceived fairness of the penalties for not using a seatbelt, aberrant driving and using a handheld mobile phone while driving. Drivers who reported no offences during the last year, perceived the penalties for speeding as being too mild, when compared to drivers with at least one penalty over the previous year. Contrarily, offenders reported the penalties for speeding as being too severe. Offenders, who experienced driving license suspension, perceived the penalties as being too severe for drink driving and aberrant driving than offenders who received monetary fines. In summary, both Lithuanian offenders and non-offenders generally perceived the penalties for traffic rule offences as adequate and fair, but individual differences and the experience of traffic sanctions were related to the perceived justice of specific penalties."
https://openalex.org/W4283462728,"Handwriting difficulty (HD) is a widely discussed issue. Previous researchers have revealed many valuable kinematics related to the handwriting performance. However, a clear understanding of the kinetics of handwriting performance in children with HD is still lacking. Therefore, this study investigated the writing performance of children with HD via a force acquisition pen (FAP), which detects the force applied from the digits and pen tip.Data from 64 school-age children were divided into control (36 children without HD; mean age: 7.97 years) and HD (28 children with HD; mean age: 8.67 years) groups. The participants were asked to perform a tracing task using the FAP at their usual writing pace.Compared with the control group, the HD group had significantly less pen-tip force, an average amount of force (in-air) from all three digits, higher force variations (whole task) in the index finger, less force fluctuations with the index and middle fingers and a smaller force ratio.The findings of this study suggest that an understanding of the handwriting kinetics and the role of digits in handwriting may be crucial for further planning strategies for handwriting training for children with HD."
