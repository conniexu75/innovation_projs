https://openalex.org/W2050877755,"The use of solution mixing followed by gelation to make ultrahomogeneous glasses and ceramics of various oxide compositions for laboratory experimentation, with first organic and later principally colloidal inorganic, precursors was developed over 30 years ago. Major technologies that use the solution-sol-gel route have been developed to make nuclear fuel pellets, ceramic fibers, thin coatings, and abrasive grain. This article reviews the early history and summarizes present research in this field, particularly new processes aimed at achieving xerogel precursors of maximum heterogeneity with respect either to composition or to structure. Such nanocomposites provide major advantages in lowering sintering temperatures, refining microstructure, and controlling morphology and final phase composition."
https://openalex.org/W1987861166,"Spectroscopic characterizations of the stereochemistry of complexes of ammonia (NH3) have strongly confirmed some long-held ideas about the weak interactions of NH3 while casting doubt on others. As expected, NH3 is observed to be a nearly universal proton acceptor, accepting hydrogen bonds from even some of the weakest proton donors. Surprisingly, no evidence has been found to support the view that NH3 acts as a proton donor through hydrogen bonding. A critical evaluation of the work that has been done to gather such evidence, as well as of earlier work involving condensed-phase observations, suggests that NH3 might well be best described as a powerful hydrogen-bond acceptor with little propensity to donate hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W2159120594,"Resuspended material experimentally derived from natural marine sediments and added to dark microcosms containing natural seawater stimulated the suspended microheterotrophs (bacteria and protozoa) to attain 2.6 times the biovolume of controls after 32 hours. Free bacteria benefited most from the stimulus, both numerically and volumetrically. Attached suspended bacteria also increased in number during the first 64 hours of the experiment; particles remaining in suspension became more densely packed with bacteria. This increased microbial production may be an important source of high-quality biomass for consumers in the nearshore zone, depending on the frequency, duration, and intensity of resuspension events in a given region."
https://openalex.org/W1994312990,"Although the United States seems to be neither behind when it comes to research and development on new products or the willingness of its consumers to buy new products, the evidence clearly shows that it is behind when it comes to process technologies. Often Americans, even when a correction is made for wage differences, cannot produce goods at the price or quality levels achieved abroad. There is no one overriding reason for this lag in process technologies. An undereducated and trained labor force, too little savings and investment, a failure to see production as a central task, and a number of other factors have all contributed to the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2010002543,"An analysis of the college attendance or college choice for four high-aptitude, high-school senior samples suggests that the differential institutional productivity of scientists and scholars is a function of the differential college attendance, paternal vocational motivations, and their implied correlates among high-aptitude students. This formulation appears to be more probable for males than for females. The institutional productivity hypothesis proposed in previous studies is not supported by the present evidence (14)."
https://openalex.org/W2057858215,"The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen on Venus has been accepted as proof of a wetter, more Earth-like past on that planet. However, the present-day water abundance and the nonthermal hydrogen escape flux on Venus imply that hydrogen is in a steady state and that a hydrogen source, most likely cometary infall, is present. An alternative interpretation of the D/H ratio is offered, in which the measured value is consistent with a steady-state evolution over the age of the solar system. No past water excess is required to explain the isotopic data."
https://openalex.org/W2072086298,"Dislocation core structures in garnet [grossularite (Ca(2.9)Fe(II)(0.1))(Al(1.9)Fe(III)(0.1)Si(3.0)O(12)] have been examined with near atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. Dissociated dislocations have been observed as parallel a/4<111> partial dislocations that are separated by stacking faults. The partial dislocations have narrow cores ( approximately 3 burgers vectors), and the stacking fault zone between the narrow partial dislocations is apparently a low-energy configuration that results from the occupancy of previously unfilled dodecahedral and tetrahedral sites. Previous studies of garnet dislocations suggested that dissociation involves departures from garnet stoichiometry (that is, trace amounts of impurities), but evidence of detectable amounts of impurities has not been found even in the highest resolution images. These results have implications for mantle mineral rheology and transformations as well as for ceramics of material science interest."
https://openalex.org/W2050916937,The Great Barrier Reef complex of northeastern Australia thins dramatically and becomes younger from north to south. These variations are a consequence of the Cenozoic northward movement of the Indian-Australian plate. The temperate climatic conditions that applied off northeast Australia during the early Tertiary were progressively replaced by tropical conditions. The present-day south-to-north facies distribution along the eastern Australian continental margin mimics the Cenozoic vertical facies sequence through the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef region.
https://openalex.org/W2040854896,"Three-dimensional imaging of the density of nitrogen in a supersonic expansion from a nozzle by means of beam-deflection optical tomography is described. With a very simple apparatus, images could be obtained with high absolute accuracy, high spatial resolution, and wide dynamic range."

https://openalex.org/W2091989792,"Two new reports made at the high-temperature symposium at the Materials Research Society's fall meeting in Boston concerning the superconductor compound, yttrium-barium-copper oxide ceramic, are presented. One report dealt with a new fabrication technique developed by workers at Bell Laboratories. This new procedure termed melt-textured growth process involves pressing yttrium-barium-copper oxide powders into the desired shape, sintering, and then cooling by a proprietary regimen to bring it back to room temperature. This process produces a material with a much higher critical current than previously reported. The second report dealt with superconductivity at room temperature as measured by workers at Georgia Institute of Technology. The detailed instructions for the preparation of the ceramics with a transition temperature of 500 K and superconductivity at room temperature are reported. These compounds were found to be very moisture-sensitive but were stable for up to 3 weeks in a moisture-free atmosphere."
