https://openalex.org/W1984515155,"Diets rich in fish and fish oils are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. The interaction of a commercial fish oil extract (MaxEPA) with vascular endothelial cells (ECs) was studied as a possible mechanism for this protective effect. MaxEPA almost completely inhibited EC production of platelet-derived growth factor-like protein (PDGFc) while other lipids had a lesser effect or no effect. Overall protein synthesis was not reduced, nor was the inhibition due to defective secretion or increased degradation of the growth factor. Antioxidants suppressed the inhibitory activity of MaxEPA indicating that free radical oxidative processes were required for the inhibition. These results suggest that fish oils may suppress intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation by decreasing the production of EC-derived paracrine growth factors. This inhibitory process represents a possible molecular mechanism for the antiatherosclerotic action of marine lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1502261731,"We have studied the effects of extracellular nucleotides on the cytosolic free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) in J774 macrophages using quin2 and indo-1 as indicator dyes. Micromolar quantities of ATP induced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]i: a rapid and transient increase (peak I) which was due to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and a second more sustained elevation (peak II) due to influx of extracellular Ca2+. The sustained peak II elevation had two components, a (1 microM ATP) response which saturated at 10-50 microM ATP and a high response, apparent at [ATP] greater than 100 microM. The latter component was not seen with nucleotides other than ATP and correlated with an ATP-induced generalized increase in plasma membrane permeability. A variant J774 cell line was isolated which does not demonstrate this ATP-induced increase in plasma membrane permeability; nevertheless, it demonstrated both the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the low threshold component of the Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in response to nucleoside di- and triphosphates. Several lines of evidence indicate that the fully ionized (i.e. free acid) forms of nucleoside di- and triphosphates were the ligands that mediated these increases in [Ca2+]i. These data show that extracellular nucleotides mediate Ca2+ fluxes by two distinct mechanisms in J774 cells. In one, the rise in [Ca2+]i is due to release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This response is elicited preferentially by the free acid forms of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside di- and triphosphates. In the other, the rise in [Ca2+]i reflects a more generalized increase in plasma membrane permeability and is elicited by ATP4- only."

https://openalex.org/W1525686550,"Abstract We have previously described and characterized a nuclear protein at 40 kDa/pI 5 termed which is tightly bound to the nuclear matrix. We demonstrated that a rapid increase in the synthesis of numatrin at early G1 phase is closely correlated with receptor-mediated induction of cellular proliferation by various mitogens and that elevated amounts of numatrin are found in tumor cells, suggesting that numatrin may have an important role in regulation of cellular growth in normal and malignant cells. Further experiments were undertaken to compare the biochemical characteristics of numatrin to those of other known proteins that are associated with cellular mitogenesis. Comparison of the electrophoretic mobility of numatrin with the proliferation cell nuclear antigen/cyclin showed that these proteins are not identical. However, numatrin had an identical electrophoretic migration on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to that of a previously described nucleolar protein B23. The tryptic digest peptide map of 125I-labeled B23 was identical to that of numatrin on two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis/chromatography. Labeling of cells with 32P further showed that numatrin is a major phosphoprotein as previously reported for protein B23. Using the protocol for purification of B23, we purified numatrin from nucleoli of HL-60 cells and produced two polyclonal antibodies (303 and 339) to this protein. We further show that numatrin is recognized by anti-B23 monoclonal antibody as well as by polyclonal antibodies 303 and 339 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Conversely, these anti-numatrin polyclonal antibodies cross-react with protein B23 as shown in immunoblot analysis. These results, taken collectively, prove that numatrin is identical to the nucleolar protein B23 and thus suggest that protein B23 and events which occur at the nucleolus might have an important role in early transduction of mitogenic signals at the G1 phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1550055395,"Partially purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from infectious vaccinia virus particles exhibits the following two activities: 1) specific transcription of double-stranded DNA templates containing vaccinia early promoters and 2) nonspecific transcription of single-stranded DNA templates. After further purification of the RNA polymerase, specific transcriptase activity was selectively diminished suggesting the loss of a transcription factor. In agreement with the latter hypothesis, transcriptase activity could be reconstituted by mixing the purified RNA polymerase with certain column fractions. A quantitative complementation assay was developed and used to locate the transcription factor during successive column chromatography steps. The factor eluted as a single peak of activity from single strand DNA-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns. An observation that the transcription factor binds specifically to vaccinia early promoter sequences was exploited in the final affinity chromatography steps. The purified factor was separated from all previously identified vaccinia enzymes and contained two polypeptides of Mr 77,000 and 82,000. A DNA-dependent ATPase activity also copurified with the transcription factor. Although a single template was used for assays during isolation, the purified factor stimulated transcription of three other early genes by 20-30-fold suggesting that it has a general role in conferring promoter specificity for initiation of early transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1544737871,"The effects of temperature on the assembly of collagen fibrils were examined in a system in which collagen monomers are generated de novo and in a physiological buffer by specific enzymic cleavage of type I pC-collagen, an intermediate in the normal processing of type I procollagen to type I collagen. Increasing the temperature of the reaction in the range of 29-35 degrees C decreased the turbidity lag and increased the rate of propagation as assayed by turbidity. The effect of temperature on the turbidity propagation rate gave a linear Arrhenius plot with a negative slope. The predicted value of the activation energy of propagation was 113 kJ/mol. However, the effects of temperature on the rate of assembly above 37 degrees C were opposite to the effects seen at temperatures below 37 degrees C. In the range of 37-41 degrees C, the turbidity propagation rate decreased markedly with temperature. Also, the turbidity lag increased. Therefore, much longer times were required for monomers to reach equilibrium with fibrils. A large fraction of the collagen monomers remaining in solution at temperatures above 37 degrees C was sensitive to rapid digestion by trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. Cooling the solutions to 25 degrees C made the monomers resistant to protease digestion. The results are consistent with the conclusion that, although formation of collagen fibrils is a classical example of an entropy-driven process of self-assembly, the rate of assembly between 37 and 41 degrees C is limited by reversible micro-unfolding of the monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1516836596,"Studies with fluorescent Ca2+ indicators in large populations of neutrophils in suspension reveal a stable base line followed by a rapid agonist-induced elevation of cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+]i, concomitant with other parameters of cellular activation. To study the role of adhesion in cell activation, we monitored [Ca2+]i in single neutrophils adhered to albumin-coated or fibronectin-coated glass coverslips before and after stimulation with the chemotactic peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP). Human neutrophils loaded with 2 microM fura 2/AM were allowed to adhere to coverslips for 15-20 min at 37 degrees C. [Ca2+]i was monitored with a dual excitation microfluorimeter with a time resolution of 200 ms. Statistical analysis was performed using an algorithm allowing to detect significant [Ca2+]i peaks. 54% of the cells showed spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. The amplitude of these [Ca2+]i peaks averaged 77 +/- 10 nM above basal levels (mean value of 110 +/- 20 nM), and their mean duration was 28 +/- 5 s; periods of [Ca2+]i bursts could last up to 15 min. In silent cells exhibiting a stable [Ca2+]i base line without spontaneous oscillations, low concentrations of fMLP (10(-10)-10(-9) M) could induce sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations. By contrast, higher agonist concentrations (10(-6) M) induced a single [Ca2+]i transient followed by a stable base line. 47% of the cells showing spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations did not respond to fMLP. Spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations depended on the continuous presence of extracellular Ca2+. Therefore: (i) spontaneous oscillations of [Ca2+]i occur in neutrophils adherent to various substrata; (ii) these oscillations do not preclude and can be dissociated from the response to fMLP; (iii) neutrophil functions might be controlled by [Ca2+]i oscillations rather than by sustained alterations of [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1512854463,"The effects of ischemia on mitochondrial function and the unidirectional rate of ATP synthesis (Pi----ATP rate) were studied using a Langendorff-perfused heart preparation and 31P NMR spectroscopy. There was significant postischemic depression of mechanical function assessed as the heart rate pressure product, and the myocardial oxygen consumption rate at a given rate pressure product was elevated. Experiments performed on glucose- and pyruvate-perfused hearts demonstrated the presence of a large contribution to the unidirectional Pi----ATP rate catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase. This rate was much greater than the maximal glucose utilization rate in the myocardium, demonstrating that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphoglycerate kinase reactions are near equilibrium both before and after ischemia. In the pyruvate-perfused postischemic hearts, the glycolytic contribution was eliminated and the net rate of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was measurable. Despite the reduced mechanical function and increased myocardial oxygen consumption rate, the ratio of the net rate of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation to oxygen consumption rate (the P:O ratio) was not altered subsequent to ischemia (2.34 +/- 0.12 and 2.36 +/- 0.09 in normal and postischemic hearts, respectively). Therefore, mitochondrial uncoupling cannot be the cause of postischemic depression in mechanical function; instead, the data suggest the existence of ischemia-induced inefficiency in ATP utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1515414814,"2-(2-Furoyl)-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (FFI) is a fluorescent molecule which was originally discovered in chloroform extract of ammoniacal solution of acid-hydrolyzed glycated proteins and proposed to represent a protein cross-link. The absence of a lysyl residue side chain and other observations promoted a detailed study of its mechanism of formation. Glycated alpha-t-Butoxycarbonyllysine was incubated for 29 days and periodically assayed for FFI and FFI-like fluorescence. Whereas fluorescence increased over time, FFI recovery was unexpectedly highest on day 0 and lowest on day 29, suggesting that FFI was directly derived from Amadori products. FFI was also recovered from hydrolysates of glycated neopentylamine, furosine, and browned poly-L-lysine but was virtually undetectable in similar solutions basified with NaOH, triethylamine, or pyridine instead of ammonia. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of FFI from similar hydrolysates basified in the presence of 15N-enriched NH4Cl revealed for all precursors a parent ion peak at 230 instead of 228 m/e units, suggesting that the two imidazole nitrogen atoms had been incorporated from free ammonia into FFI. Spontaneous FFI synthesis occurred when furosine was reacted with aqueous ammonia at room temperature. These results do not support the proposition that FFI is an advanced glycosylation end product or a protein cross-link. They suggest that FFI is formed from ammonia and furosine which are by-products of acid-hydrolyzed glycated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1569351726,"More than 60% of brain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans were extracted from 10-day-old rat brains by homogenization in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Although the soluble proteoglycan preparation was a mixture of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans with a different hydrodynamic size as well as a different molecular density, each subfraction of the proteoglycans contained chondroitin sulfate side chains with virtually identical molecular weight (approximately 15,000) and chondroitin sulfate disaccharide composition (high content of 4-sulfate unit). Digestion of the purified proteoglycan preparation with protease-free chondroitinase ABC produced five core proteins with Mr = 250,000 (designated as 250K protein), 220,000 (220K), 150,000 (150K), 130,000 (130K), and 93,000 (93K). All these core proteins were obtained from chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan preparations extracted from various regions of the brain, but their composition varied among different brain regions. Analysis for amino acid composition of these core proteins and two-dimensional mapping of their proteolytic peptides revealed that three major core proteins (250K, 220K, and 150K proteins) were structurally different. These observations indicate that at least three distinct types of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan occur in the developing rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W1573717060,"Transcription from class II promoters requires five general factors, IIA, IIB, IID, IIE, and IIF, in addition to RNA polymerase II for basal levels of transcription (Reinberg, D., Flores, O., and Buckbinder, L. (1987) in Molecular Biology of RNA: New Perspectives (Inouye, M., and Dudock, B., eds) pp. 423-439, Academic Press, Orlando, FL). A protein fraction containing transcription factors (TF) IIE and IIF was able to reconstitute transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter when added to extracts depleted of the RNA polymerase II-associating proteins RAP 30 and RAP 74 (Sopta, M., Carthew, R.W., and Greenblatt, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10353-10360). Studies with monoaffinity-purified antibodies directed against RAP 30 demonstrated, by Western blot analysis, that RAP 30 copurifies on five columns with transcription factor IIF. That RAP 30 is a functional component of TFIIF was also demonstrated; preincubation of anti-RAP 30 antibodies with purified TFIIF inhibited transcription. Inhibition of transcription was overcome by the addition of purified TFIIF. RAP 30 is an integral part of a preinitiation complex; the incubation of all the general transcription factors with a promoter-containing DNA, prior to the addition of the anti-RAP 30 antibodies, resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex that was not inhibited by the antibodies. Incubation of the transcription factors in the absence of a promoter-containing DNA resulted in a complex that was partially resistant to the antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1585377215,"Stopped-flow rapid scan techniques were used to obtain a spectrum of nearly homogeneous lignin peroxidase compound I (LiPI) under pseudo-first order conditions at the unusually low pH optimum (3.0) for the enzyme. The LiPI spectrum had a Soret band at 407 nm with approximately 60% reduced intensity and a visible maximum at 650 nm. Under steady-state conditions a Soret spectrum for lignin peroxidase compound II (LiPII) was also obtained. The Soret maximum of LiPII at 420 nm was only approximately 15% reduced in intensity compared to native LiP. Transient state kinetic results confirmed the pH independence of LiPI formation over the pH range 3.06-7.39. The rate constant was (6.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(5) M-1 S-1. Addition of excess veratryl alcohol to LiPI resulted in its reduction to LiPII with subsequent reduction of LiPII to the native enzyme. Reactions of LiPI and LiPII with veratryl alcohol exhibited marked pH dependencies. For the LiPI reaction the rate constants ranged from 2.5 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 at pH 3.06 to 4.1 x 10(3) M-1 S-1 at pH 7.39; for the LiPII reaction, 1.6 x 10(5) M-1 S-1 (pH 3.06) to 2.3 x 10(3) M-1 S-1 (pH 5.16). These single turnover experiments demonstrate directly that the pH dependence of these reactions dictates the overall pH dependence of this novel enzyme. These results are consistent with the one-electron oxidation of veratryl alcohol to an aryl cation radical by LiPI and by LiPII."
https://openalex.org/W160167131,"Membrane and soluble forms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were selectively prepared from human placental microsomes by treatment with 1-butanol at pH 8.5 and 5.5, respectively. The purified membrane (mALP) and soluble (sALP) forms were analyzed for chemical compositions. mALP was found to contain 1 mol each of palmitate, stearate, and glycerol/subunit of ALP, which were absent in sALP. Both the forms contained 1 mol of inositol and 2 mol of ethanolamine/subunit. However, none of these compounds was detectable in another soluble form prepared by treatment with papain, which is known to cleave the carboxyl-terminal region. The results suggest that mALP contains diacylglycerol, the removal of which results in its conversion to sALP. We then prepared [3H]ethanolamine-labeled ALP by incubating choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3) with the isotope. 3H-Labeled sALP was mixed with unlabeled sALP and treated with papain. A 3H-labeled single component was purified from the digests by sequential chromatography through anti-ALP-IgG-Sepharose, concanavalin A-Sepharose, Bio-Gel P-6, and TSK G-2000 columns. Chemical analyses revealed that the purified sample contains the tripeptide Thr-Thr-Asp, ethanolamine, glucosamine, mannose, inositol, and phosphate. Molar ratios of the latter five compounds were calculated to be 2, 1, 3, 1, and 2, respectively, by taking Asp as 1 mol. The tripeptide sequence was identified at positions 482-484 in the primary structure deduced from the cDNA sequence, which predicts a further extension to position 513, containing a hydrophobic amino acid sequence. Taken together, these results suggest that the mature ALP molecule lacks the predicted carboxyl-terminal peptide extension and is attached at Asp484 with a glycosylphospholipid, the components of which are characterized above. The glycosylphospholipid thus attached is considered to function as the membrane anchor of ALP."
https://openalex.org/W1524311754,"The noncollagenous domain of collagen from three different basement membranes of bovine origin (glomerular, lens capsule, and placental) was excised with bacterial collagenase, purified under nondenaturing conditions, and characterized. In each case the domain existed as a hexamer comprised of four distinct subunits (alpha 1 (IV) NC1, alpha 2 (IV) NC1, M2*, and M3). Each subunit exists in both monomeric and dimeric (disulfide-cross-linked) forms. Certain dimers also exist which contain nonreducible cross-links. The hexamers from the three membranes differ with respect to stoichiometry of subunits and subunit isoforms and to the degree of cross-linking of monomers into dimers. The minor subunits, M2* and M3, vary in quantity over a 20-fold range relative to the major ones among the three hexamers. The results indicate that: 1) at least two populations of triple-helical collagen molecules, differing in chain composition, exist in each membrane and that their relative proportions are tissue-specific; and 2) the chemical nature of the noncollagenous domain of these populations is tissue-specific with regard to subunit isoforms and relative proportion of reducible and nonreducible cross-links in dimers. A novel structural feature of the noncollagenous domain of basement membrane collagen was also evinced from these studies. Namely, that each of the four monomeric subunits exists in charge isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2074233096,"Viroids are very small, unencapsidated RNAs that replicate and induce severe disease in plants without encoding for any proteins. The mechanisms by which the viroid RNA regulates these events and interacts with host factors are unknown. An Mr 68,000 host-encoded protein has been identified that is differentially phosphorylated in extracts from viroid-infected and mock-inoculated tissues. This phosphoprotein is immunologically related to a double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase from virus-infected, interferon-treated human cells. Further, nucleotide photoaffinity labeling indicates that the protein has an ATP binding site. This protein is similar to dsRNA-dependent protein kinases implicated in mammalian systems in the regulation of protein synthesis and virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W2076387494,"The parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei contains a highly organized membrane skeleton, consisting of a dense array of parallel, singlet microtubules that are laterally interconnected and that are also in tight contact with the overlying cell membrane. A high molecular weight, heat-stable protein from this membrane skeleton was isolated that is localized along the microtubules. Protease digestion experiments and sequencing of a cloned gene segment showed that most of the protein is built up by more than 50 nearly identical tandem repeats with a periodicity of 38 amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1648275266,"The amino acid sequence of an insect apolipoprotein, apolipophorin-III from Locusta migratoria, has been deduced from the sequence of its cloned cDNA. The mature hemolymph protein consists of 161 amino acids. Optimized alignments of this protein with apolipophorin-III from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, disclosed an overall sequence identity of only 29%, even though the two proteins are functionally equivalent. The L. migratoria sequence is composed of 12 repeating peptides that are variable in length. Six amphipathic helical segments of varying length were identified in each protein using a newly described algorithm for detecting such secondary structures. The degree of sequence identity between the two insect apoproteins is considerably less than that observed among orthologous mammalian apolipoproteins. However, calculation of the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions indicates that the insect genes may be evolving at rates similar to the mammalian apolipoprotein genes. Further comparative analyses of insect and mammalian apolipoproteins should provide insights about the limits of sequence diversity tolerated by their predicted amphipathic helical domains."
https://openalex.org/W1597542929,"The influence of high density lipoproteins (HDL) on luteinizing hormone-stimulated rat ovarian theca/interstitial cell steroidogenesis was studied. Without HDL the cells produced primarily androgens from progestin precursors. In the presence of rat or human HDL steroid output increased 3-5-fold, but the type of steroid produced was dependent on the source of the HDL. Human HDL nonselectively amplified luteinizing hormone-stimulated steroid production, whereas rat HDL promoted progestin production without a concomitant increase in androgen output. Comparisons of the activities of apoprotein E-rich HDL (e.g. HDL from intact mature rats) with apoprotein E-poor HDL (e.g. human HDL or rat HDL from hypophysectomized immature rats) suggested that apoprotein E was responsible for the inhibition of androgen production. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of rat HDL was abolished by depleting apoprotein E-containing lipoproteins with heparin affinity chromatography. Direct evidence that apoprotein E was the inhibitory constituent of rat HDL was obtained by showing that isolated lipid-free rat apoprotein E inhibited androgen production, whereas isolated rat apoproteins A-I and A-IV did not. The possible paracrine function of apoprotein E in ovarian follicular maturation of the ovary is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1609809124,"Certain normal strains of human fecal bacteria are unique in producing extracellular glycosidases that degrade the oligosaccharide chains of gut mucin glycoproteins. We have studied the action of such glycosidases partially purified from the cell-free supernates of five of these strains on intestinal glycosphingolipids isolated from human meconium. The glycolipids were sialosyl-lactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and fucolipids with A, B, H, Lea, or Leb blood group determinants. In addition to the strain-specific high blood group A-degrading activities (Ruminococcus torques strains VIII-239 and IX-70), B-degrading activity (Ruminococcus AB strain VI-268), and H-degrading activities (all strains) corresponding to alpha 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, alpha 1-3-galactosidase and alpha 1-2-fucosidase, respectively, all strains also degraded sialosyl-lactosylceramide and Lea and Leb antigenic glycolipids, indicating the presence of alpha 2-3-neuraminidases and alpha 1-4-fucosidases. Enzyme preparations from Bifidobacterium infantis strain VIII-240 and R. torques strain VIII-239 hydrolyzed the Lea active glycolipid directly to lactosylceramide, suggesting the presence of endo-beta 1-3-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. Similar endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities were identified in four of the five enzyme preparations. The enzymes produced by R. AB strain VI-268 lacked this activity as well as beta 1-3-galactosidase, and thus degradation stopped at lactotetraosylceramide. With enzyme preparations from the other strains lactosylceramide was the single major degradation product from complex glycosphingolipids with less than 30% further degradation to glucosylceramide within 48 h. We conclude that glycosidases from mucin-degrading strains of human enteric bacteria degrade oligosaccharide chains of lactoseries fucolipids and gangliosides of intestinal origin primarily to lactosylceramide. Since several genera of enteric bacteria bind preferentially to lactosylceramide in vitro, mucin-degrading strains may have an important ecological role in host-microbial associations in the human gut."
https://openalex.org/W1549546256,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) regulates the transcription of a specific subset of genes through a receptor-mediated mechanism. We have isolated a cDNA to a TCDD-inducible rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase and have shown that its induction by TCDD differs from that of another TCDD-induced gene, cytochrome P-450c, with regard to dose-response relationship, induction kinetics, and tissue specificity. At least a 10-fold higher dose of TCDD was required for half-maximal induction of TCDD-inducible rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase in rat liver than the dose that half-maximally induced cytochrome P-450c. Further, the kinetics of induction of TCDD-inducible rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase by TCDD in rat liver was delayed compared with that of cytochrome P-450c. Striking discrepancies were found in the capacity of various organs to induce both TCDD-inducible rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase and cytochrome P-450c in a coordinated manner in response to TCDD. Organs that were able to evoke one of these responses to TCDD were not necessarily able to evoke coordinately the other response. The capacity of an organ to exhibit either of these two responses to TCDD did not correlate stringently with reported Ah receptor abundance. Our data suggest that TCDD can modulate the expression of specific genes in different ways and that regulatory pathways in addition to the classically defined Ah receptor may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1577743076,"Normal human fibroblasts have two extreme modes of existence in culture, quiescent and proliferative. The growth and division of these cells are usually well regulated by the action of various endogenously generated stimulators and inhibitors. We have speculated that an extracellular sialidase may be involved in the regulation of growth and that inhibition of this activity might decrease or abolish cell growth. To test this hypothesis, we have incubated preconfluent cultures of fibroblasts in the presence and absence of a potent sialidase inhibitor, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid. Treatment of cells with this inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of an extracellular sialidase activity for up to 24 h and had a marked growth inhibitory effect in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of the inhibitor on cell proliferation was specific and reversible. During a chase period of 48 h after pulse labeling cells with [3H]N-acetylmannosamine and [14C]serine, there was a 15% decrease of [3H]sialic acid in the membrane-bound GM3 with 80 microM inhibitor in the medium, as compared with a 32% decrease in the controls. Our results suggest that an extracellular sialidase may participate in cell-surface modifications that accompany (or control) the changes observed when cells traverse the cell cycle, from the quiescent to the proliferative phase."
https://openalex.org/W1886533962,"The B19 parvovirus produces two capsid proteins in strikingly different quantities (VP1 less than 4%, VP2 greater than 96%) from overlapping RNAs that are derived from the same transcription unit. Immediately upstream from the VP1 translation initiation site is an unusual sequence containing multiple ATG triplets. During RNA processing this sequence is spliced out of VP2 RNA. To test the regulatory role on translation of this sequence containing upstream AUGs, synthetic RNAs were produced in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from various plasmid constructions. Translation of VP1 RNA was very inefficient compared to VP2 RNA in a cell-free system, indicating that capsid protein production was regulated at the level of translation. Removal of upstream AUG sequences from VP1 RNA greatly increased the efficiency of translation. Conversely, the addition of the same AUG-rich sequence upstream of the initiation site of VP2 decreased its translation. These data indicate that an upstream AUG-rich region acts as a negative regulatory element in the translational control of B19 capsid protein production."
https://openalex.org/W1533403286,"Previous results suggested that F2A8, a glycosylation mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells, had a lower amount of dolichyl phosphate available for asparagine-linked glycosylation reactions relative to parental cells. The steady-state amounts and identities of polyisoprenoid lipids were determined by incubating F2A8, its parental cell line B4-2-1, and wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells for 24 h with [2-3H]mevalonate. The neutral lipids, ubiquinone, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters, which were the most highly labeled from [3H]mevalonate, were labeled equally in all three cell types. In wild-type and B4-2-1 cells, mevalonate incorporation into the anionic glycosylated and phosphorylated derivatives of dolichol was 10-fold higher than into the neutral free dolichol and dolichyl esters. In contrast, in F2A8 cells, label accumulated in neutral polyisoprenol lipids, so that the ratio of neutral to anionic lipids was 1:1 rather than 1:10. In wild-type and B4-2-1 cells, the polyisoprenoid found as free alcohol and in phosphorylated and glycosylated forms was shown by high pressure liquid chromatography using a silica column to be primarily dolichol, a polyisoprenol that has a saturated terminal isoprene unit. In contrast, in F2A8 cells the polyisoprenoid found primarily as the free alcohol and in phosphorylated and glycosylated forms appeared to be completely unsaturated polyprenol. The distribution of chain lengths of the labeled polyisoprenols of F2A8, B4-2-1, and wild-type cells was the same as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography using a reverse-phase column, with the predominant chain length being 19 isoprene units. These results combined with our previous studies on the phenotype of the F2A8 mutant indicate that the unsaturated polyprenyl phosphate derivatives do not function as well as dolichyl phosphate derivatives in cellular glycosylation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1514633550,"Cathepsin H purified from porcine spleens was studied for its specificity against various peptide and denatured protein substrates. The enzyme degraded all peptide substrates exclusively by an aminopeptidase activity. The enzyme preferentially released NH2-terminal amino acid residues with large hydrophobic (Phe, Trp, Leu, and Tyr) or basic (Arg and Lys) side chains. Amino acids containing small or polar side chains were not released. Peptides with a proline in the NH2-terminal or penultimate positions were not hydrolyzed either. Large polypeptides such as reduced and carboxymethylated soybean trypsin inhibitor and aldolase were not degraded. These results indicate that cathepsin H is an exopeptidase but not an endopeptidase. We propose that the biological role of this enzyme is the degradation of tissue proteins in lysosomes by its aminopeptidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523050612,"The tubulin heterodimer binds a molecule of GTP at the nonexchangeable nucleotide-binding site (N-site) and either GDP or GTP at the exchangeable nucleotide-binding site (E-site). Mg2+ is known to be tightly linked to the binding of GTP at the E-site (Correia, J. J., Baty, L. T., and Williams, R. C., Jr. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17278-17284). Measurements of the exchange of Mn2+ for bound Mg2+ (as monitored by atomic absorption and EPR) demonstrate that tubulin which has GDP at the E-site possesses one high affinity metal-binding site and that tubulin which has GTP at the E-site possesses two such sites. The apparent association constants are 0.7-1.1 x 10(6) M-1 for Mg2+ and approximately 4.1-4.9 x 10(7) M-1 for Mn2+. Divalent cations do bind to GDP at the E-site, but with much lower affinity (2.0-2.3 x 10(3) M-1 for Mg2+ and 3.9-6.6 x 10(3) M-1 for Mn2+). These data suggest that divalent cations are involved in GTP binding to both the N- and E-sites of tubulin. The N-site metal exchanges slowly (kapp = 0.020 min-1), suggesting a mechanism involving protein or heterodimer dissociation. The N-site metal exchange rate is independent of the concentration of protein and metal, an observation consistent with the possibility that a dynamic breathing process is the rate-limiting step. The exchange of Mn2+ for Mg2+ has no effect on the secondary structure of tubulin at 4 degrees C or on the ability of tubulin to form microtubules. These results have important consequences for the interpretation of distance measurements within the tubulin dimer using paramagnetic ions. They are also relevant to the detailed mechanism of divalent cation release from microtubules after GTP hydrolysis."

These proteins coexist in the sperm nuclei with a small percentage of a full histone complement. All of them have a very similar amino acid composition, following what seems to be the general composition prototype for the class Bivalvia (Ausio, J. (1986) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Comp. Biochem. 85, 439-449). Nevertheless, they have different molecular weights (PL-I = 23,500, PL-II = 15,600, and PL-III = 7,900) as measured by sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Furthermore, the PL-I component shares common features with the proteins of the histone H1 family. Yet, it is very unusual, for it contains 2 cysteine residues that are located in the trypsin-resistant core of this protein. The protamine-like fraction PL-III exhibits intraspecific microheterogeneity which is reflected by the presence of two protein variants which most probably are the result of an allelic polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1582112009,"We have generated antibodies against synthetic peptides which represent the carboxyl terminus of either the major, or the two minor, forms of the rat hepatic lectin which recognizes galactose-terminated glycoproteins (asialoglycoproteins). The antibodies were shown to be specific for the form of the lectin containing the immunizing peptide sequence by the following: reaction with purified lectin after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured lectin, immunoprecipitation of lectin synthesized in vitro. These antibodies, however, precipitated all three rat hepatic lectin forms from nonionic detergent extracts of hepatocytes labeled with 125I via the lactoperoxidase catalyzed technique. A similar result was obtained if antibody was bound to intact cells prior to solubilization with detergent and collection of the immune complexes. We conclude that at least the plasma membrane-associated fraction of the rat hepatic lectin forms exists as a heterotypic complex."
https://openalex.org/W1527092816,"Gel electrophoresis mobility shift and DNase I footprint assays detect a cellular nuclear protein in extracts made from uninfected human cells which binds to a downstream promoter sequence (DPS) in the human adenovirus 2 major late promoter. By DNase I footprint and mutation analyses, we have determined that this new regulatory element extends from positions +146 to +165 (relative to the cap site at position +1). We show by UV cross-linking that a 40-kDa polypeptide specifically binds to this region. Mutations within the DPS which decrease protein binding by 80-90% also cause a 2.5-3-fold decrease in in vitro major late promoter transcription efficiency. Alteration of the template in the 5'-flanking region of the DPS does not affect nuclear protein binding or transcription efficiency. Interestingly, a T----G transversion at position +160 which increases protein binding also impairs promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1512739865,"F2A8, a glycosylation mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells, was isolated without prior enrichment or selective procedures by screening colonies for reduced [3H]mannose incorporation into macromolecules. F2A8 cells incubated with [3H]mannose synthesized 70% the amount of labeled GDP-mannose found in parental cells, and the same oligosaccharides attached to lipid and protein as did parental cells, but in reduced amounts. Incorporation of radioactivity from labeled mannose into saccharide-lipids and into total glycopeptides of F2A8 was reduced 7-fold compared to parental cells. In addition, glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein was reduced in F2A8 cells as assessed by a mobility intermediate between normally glycosylated and unglycosylated protein during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In vitro assays using membrane preparations showed that F2A8 had parental levels of glucosylphosphoryldolichol synthase and of UDP-GlcNAc:dolichyl phosphate:GlcNAc-phosphotransferase when the enzymatic determinations were done in the presence of exogenous dolichyl phosphate. However, 5-fold less glucosylphosphoryldolichol synthase activity was detected in membranes of F2A8 compared to membranes of parental cells in assays relying on endogenous lipid substrate. F2A8 appears to have reduced amounts of dolichyl phosphate available for its glycosylation reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1521441040,"Abstract Earlier studies with factor IXBm Lake Elsinore (IXBmLE), a nonfunctional variant of factor IX, suggested that the defect in this protein may reside in the catalytic domain of the molecule (Usharani, P., Warn-Cramer, B. J., Kasper, C. K., and Bajaj, S. P. (1985) J. Clin. Invest. 75, 76-83). In this report, genomic DNA fragments from normal IX and IXBmLE alleles were cloned into phage lambda EMBL3 and the recombinant phage identified using normal IX cDNA and synthetic oligonucleotides. Exons VI, VII, and VIII of normal IX and IXBmLE gene were also amplified using a newly developed primer-directed polymerase chain reaction method. All eight exons and flanking regions of the normal IX and IXBmLE gene were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Comparison of the normal IX and IXBmLE sequences revealed a single base substitution (C----T) in the exon VIII of the BmLE variant, which results in the replacement of Ala390 by Val in the variant molecule. Although this mutation is in the catalytic domain of the molecule, purified factor IXaBmLE is indistinguishable from normal IXa in its activity toward a small synthetic substrate, L-tosylarginine methyl ester. These data, coupled with the previous data, identify a region (around residue 390) in the normal factor IXa which appears to play a major role in the extended macromolecular substrate binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1553328469,"The 7F0----5D0 transition of Eu3+ was used to probe the metal-binding domains of rat oncomodulin and rat parvalbumin. Two distinct differences between the two proteins were observed. The first relates to the pH-dependent behavior of their 7F0----5D0 spectra, a phenomenon noted previously for other paravalbumins. In the case of rat parvalbumin, the spectral features associated with both metal-binding sites titrate concomitantly (pK alpha = 8.2); however, in the case of oncomodulin, the two sites titrate sequentially (pK alpha = 6.3 for the CD site; pK alpha = 8.3 for EF site). The proteins also contrast with regard to their discrimination for Eu3+ over Ca2+. The CD and EF sites in rat parvalbumin both display a large preference for Eu3+: (KCa/KEu)CD = 143 +/- 11 and (KCa/KEu)EF = 191 +/- 30. However, in the case of oncomodulin, although the EF site of oncomodulin greatly prefers the trivalent lanthanide ion (KCa/KEu = 300 +/- 80), the CD site exhibits a relatively minor preference (KCa/KEu = 11 +/- 1)."
https://openalex.org/W1529976568,"The cellular uptake of pyrroline 5-carboxylate (P5C) is of interest because this nutritionally responsive constituent of human plasma can mediate the transfer of oxidizing potential into cells and stimulate the production of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. Using a cloned line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, we found that the uptake of P5C was saturable, temperature-dependent, and sensitive to metabolic inhibitors. Furthermore, this uptake of P5C exhibited unusual features. It was independent of sodium ion and had a pH optimum of 6.4. The kinetics characteristics of P5C uptake included an apparent Km of 0.46 +/- 0.04 mM and a Vmax of 19.6 +/- 1.8 nmol/min/mg. Although the Vmax for P5C was comparable to those for certain other amino acids, e.g. leucine, it was significantly higher than that for alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid in these cells. Importantly, there was no interaction between these amino acids and the uptake mechanism for P5C. Twenty naturally occurring amino acids, each at a concentration of 5 mM, were without effect on the uptake of P5C. Interestingly, the uptake mechanism for P5C is unusual in that it is linked to the transfer of reducing-oxidizing potential. Over wide ranges of P5C concentration and duration of incubation, P5C entry is coupled to its conversion to proline and the concomitant oxidation of reduced pyridine nucleotide with stimulation of the pentose phosphate shunt. In fact, no free P5C derived from the medium could be detected in cells. Our interpretation of these findings is that P5C uptake occurs by its own unique mechanism, a group translocation that mediates the transfer of reducing-oxidizing potential."
https://openalex.org/W1587847663,"Dialysis rate determinations of several fatty acids in the absence of albumin revealed that the myristate anion, like that of laurate, in aqueous solution, pH 7.5, is present as a monomer anion when the concentration is below 25 microM. Palmitate and oleate solutions, on the other hand, show a tendency to aggregation even at concentrations below 0.5 microM. Multiple binding of myristate to human serum albumin in phosphate buffer, at pH 7.5, 37 degrees C, was investigated by exchange of 14C-labeled myristate across a dialysis membrane under conditions of binding equilibrium. A binding isotherm was established by least squares fitting of the stoichiometric binding constants in the stepwise binding equation to the experimental data. The best-fit solution was supplemented with 30 acceptable solutions within a probability limit of 0.95. A concept of one or two distinct high-affinity sites for binding of fatty acids could not be verified; the observations allow a variety of binding mechanisms ranging from cooperativity of the first two myristates to a model with four equal and independent sites."
https://openalex.org/W1600002594,"A unique permeabilized adipocyte model is described in which vigorous intracellular intermediary metabolism is preserved through both the pentose and glycolytic-Krebs pathways following saponin-induced pore formation in plasma membranes. Upon addition of appropriate cofactors, the cells metabolize both glucose and glucose 6-phosphate at rates which are severalfold greater than control (membrane-intact) cells. Saponin is shown to mediate these metabolic effects solely by creating membrane pores through which substrate influx occurs. This cell model provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine intermediary metabolism in situ because it permits the entry into the cytosol of previously restricted substrates, modifiers, and radiolabeled compounds. By circumventing the glucose transporter while, for the most part, preserving plasma membrane integrity, these metabolically active, porous adipocytes may permit the direct exploration of postinsulin receptor glucose metabolism by various hormones or drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1607755861,"Abstract In fast twitch skeletal muscle, the signal for excitation-contraction coupling is transferred from transverse tubule across the triad junction; calcium is thereby released from the terminal cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum triggering muscle contraction. Recently, the feet structures of terminal cisternae, which bridge the gap at the triad junction, have been identified as the ryanodine receptor and in turn with the calcium release channels of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The latter consists of an oligomer of a single high molecular weight polypeptide (Mr 360,000). This study attempts to identify the component in the transverse tubule which ligands with the foot structure to form the triad junction. The purified ryanodine receptor, derivatized with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(p-azidosalicylimido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate (SASD), a thiol-cleavable, 125I-iodinatable, and photoactive probe, was shown to selectively cross-link to a protein with Mr of 71,000 in isolated transverse tubules. This coupling protein was purified from transverse tubule by solubilization with the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS) and then purified by sequential column chromatography. In the absence of sulfhydryl agents, the purified polypeptide has an Mr of 61,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A complementary approach using SASD was employed to confirm association of the coupling protein with the ryanodine receptor of terminal cisternae. We conclude that the transverse tubule coupling protein together with the ryanodine receptor (foot structure) is involved in the liganding between transverse tubule and terminal cisternae of sacroplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1664942993,"Evidence for a slowly dissociating tubulin-GTP cap at microtubule ends was derived from observation of a delay for attaining a maximum disassembly rate, after the temperature of steady state microtubules was rapidly decreased from 36 to 34 degrees C. The possibility that the microtubules were capped by a single tubulin-GTP subunit on each subhelix was ruled out, by comparison of the disassembly kinetics following a temperature decrease and dilution. The existence of a subpopulation of microtubules that underwent irreversible or near irreversible disassembly was demonstrated by a 30-s lag for attainment of a maximum assembly rate, after steady state microtubules were shifted from 34 to 36 degrees C. A dynamic instability model predicts that a maximum assembly rate will be delayed until disappearance of a subpopulation of microtubules that disassemble before being recapped. Analysis indicates that the 30-s lag resulted because approximately 2% of the mass in the steady state microtubule population was uncapped and disassembling and not readily recapped. The half-time for recapping of disassembling microtubules, by addition of tubulin-GTP subunits to ends, was equal to or greater than 20 s. Since tubulin-GDP dissociated from microtubules at a rate of about 4500 s-1, slow recapping resulted in dramatic shortening of disassembling microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W118923853,"Muscle cells were incubated with extracts prepared from neural tissue to investigate the mechanisms and factors which regulate mRNA transcript production of the alternatively spliced alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM) gene. Results from RNA analyses demonstrate that alpha-TM transcripts are dramatically altered by decreasing the production of the striated specific isoform while concomitantly increasing a cytoplasmic isoform. The factors which regulate alpha-TM expression are derived from neural tissue and act at the post-transcriptional level through a trans-activation mechanism. Furthermore, these factors can also alter the expression of alpha-TM mRNA isoforms in both non-muscle and primary muscle cells by regulating the exon splice site selection determined by endogenous trans-acting factors and force the production of a specific cytoplasmic isoform. The results demonstrate that the neural factors which regulate alpha-TM expression act through mechanisms and processes which are common to many different cell types and cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1494921941,"10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.6) catalyzes the NADP-dependent conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. Previous studies of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase purified from rat or pig liver homogenized in phosphate buffers indicated the presence of copurifying 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity, which catalyzes conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and formate. We find that the supernatant from rat liver homogenized in mannitol/sucrose/EDTA medium contains essentially all of the total cellular 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, but no measurable hydrolase activity. Treating mannitol/sucrose/EDTA-washed mitochondria with Triton X-100 (0.5%) releases hydrolase activity in soluble form. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase purified from the mannitol/sucrose/EDTA supernatant has no 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase activity. Results of kinetic experiments using the hydrolase-free dehydrogenase give a complex rate equation with respect to (6R,S)-10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Double-reciprocal plots fit a 2/1 hyperbolic function with apparent Km values of 3.9 and 68 microM. Our results indicate that 10-formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase and dehydrogenase are not alternate catalytic activities of a single protein, but represent two closely related and separately compartmentalized hepatic enzymes."

This compound, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr (SO3H)-Nle psi (COCH2)Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2, is able to stimulate enzyme secretion from rat pancreatic acini, with high efficacy and potency. It is also very potent in inhibiting the binding of labeled CCK-8 to rat pancreatic acini (IC50 = 5 nM) and to guinea pig and mouse brain membranes (IC50 = 0.7 nM).

Further, fluorescent derivatives of skeletal troponin C provide an excellent means of establishing a sequence assignment for the resonances observed in the 113Cd NMR. The results of these experiments demonstrate that sites I and II, the Ca2+ regulatory sites, can be assigned to resonances at -108.5 and -101.5 ppm, respectively. Sites III and IV, the structural sites, are assigned to resonances -112.8 and -106.8 ppm, respectively. These data are discussed in terms of recent structural findings and speculations."
https://openalex.org/W1592136539,"We have isolated ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) chromatin from Physarum polycephalum using a nucleolar isolation procedure that minimizes protein loss from chromatin and, subsequently, either agarose gel electrophoresis or metrizamide gradient centrifugation to purify this chromatin fraction (Amero, S. A., Ogle, R. C., Keating, J. L., Montoya, V. L., Murdoch, W. L., and Grainger, R. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 10725-10733). Metrizamide-purified rDNA chromatin obtained from nucleoli isolated according to the new procedure has a core histone/DNA ratio of 0.77:1. The major core histone classes comigrate electrophoretically with their nuclear counterparts on Triton-acid-urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate two-dimensional gels, although they may not possess the extent of secondary modification evident with the nuclear histones. This purified rDNA chromatin also possesses RNA polymerase I activity, and many other nonhistone proteins, including two very abundant proteins (26 and 38 kDa) that may be either ribonucleoproteins or nucleolar matrix proteins. Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the metrizamide-purified rDNA chromatin produces particles containing 145-base pair DNA fragments identical in length to those in total chromatin and which contain both transcribed and nontranscribed rDNA sequences. Some smaller fragments (30, 70, and 110 base pairs) are also seen, but their sequence content is not known. These particles sediment uniformly at 11 S in sucrose gradients containing 15 mM NaCl, and at 4-11 S in gradients containing 0.35 M NaCl. Particles enriched in gene or nontranscribed spacer sequences are not resolved in these sucrose gradients or in metrizamide gradients. Our findings suggest that the rDNA chromatin fraction we have identified contains transcriptionally active genes and that an organized, particle-containing structure exists in active rDNA chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1484395640,"To reveal the structure of the ATP-binding site(s) in rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase, we modified the enzyme with adenosine polyphosphopyridoxals. Adenosine tri- and tetraphosphopyridoxals at micromolar concentrations effectively inactivated the enzyme in a time-dependent manner. Inactivation of the enzyme was accelerated by the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+. Protection from inactivation was afforded by adenylyl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate and ADP. In reversible inhibition kinetics, adenosine polyphosphopyridoxals as well as their reduced compounds (adenosine polyphosphopyridoxines) competed with ATP. These results suggest that adenosine polyphosphopyridoxals bind to the ATP-binding site(s) in phosphorylase kinase. When phosphorylase kinase was incubated with adenosine triphosphopyridoxal in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, incorporation of the label into alpha, beta, and gamma subunits was observed. In the absence of both cations, larger amounts of the label were incorporated into all the subunits. Structural study on adenosine triphosphopyridoxal-modified sites in the gamma subunit (having a catalytic site) revealed that Lys-151 is mainly labeled. Based on the results of the present and other studies, it is suggested that the site around Lys-151 is involved in recognition of the substrate protein."
https://openalex.org/W1578963642,"The interaction of Xenopus transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA) with the intragenic control region (ICR) of the 5 S RNA gene was studied by footprinting techniques under conditions which elicited a unique DNase I digestion pattern. Although a typical full footprint at the ICR was apparent at a 5 nM TFIIIA concentration, higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 50 nM) resulted in a decrease in the size of the footprint (on the 5' side of the ICR) concomitant with the appearance of an alternating protection pattern (APP) located both in the 3'- and 5'-flanking regions of the ICR with a periodicity of approximately 10 base pairs. This periodicity indicates that TFIIIA binding occurs on only one side of the DNA helix. The minimum size of the highly ordered and apparently cooperative APP effect was determined to be at least 250 base pairs in length and could be abolished through competition with nonspecific DNA. However, binding of TFIIIA to nonspecific DNA alone was not sufficient to generate the APP effect at any of the TFIIIA concentrations studied. Removal of the C-terminal domain of the protein by either tryptic or papain digestion resulted in the abolition of the APP effect at all concentrations studied, indicating the necessity of the protein-protein interactions for this effect. A nucleation site, most likely at or near the ICR, is proposed to exist through which TFIIIA specifically interacts and orients the binding of additional protein molecules in a cooperative and highly ordered manner to the flanking DNA sequences on either side of the ICR. The APP effect near the ICR may play a role in the initiation and stabilization of 5 S RNA gene transcription."

There are large but different chemical shift anisotropy contributions to the 113Cd line widths for the two complexes, which reflect the known structural differences for the zinc-enzyme complexes. 113Cd-31P spin-spin coupling is also seen and differs for the two cadmium complexes, being larger, 28 Hz, for the bidentate N-phosphoryl-L-leucineamide ligand than for the monodentate phosphoramidon, 16 Hz. Large changes in chemical shift, 7.5-10.9 ppm, are seen for the 31P resonances of the inhibitors upon binding to the enzyme reflecting direct phosphoryl-metal ligation. Chemical shift anisotropy is the dominant relaxation mechanism for the 31P nuclei at 9.4 T, while the dipole-dipole contribution seems to be unaffected by a change of solvent from H2O to D2O."
https://openalex.org/W1530844112,"We have undertaken the purification of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) chromatin from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, in order to study its chromatin structure. In this organism rDNA exists in nucleoli as highly repeated minichromosomes, and one can obtain crude chromatin fractions highly enriched in rDNA from isolated nucleoli. We first developed a nucleolar isolation method utilizing polyamines as stabilization agents that results in a chromatin fraction containing far more protein than is obtained by the more commonly used divalent cation isolation methods. The latter method appears to result in extensive histone loss during chromatin isolations. Two methods were then used for purifying rDNA chromatin from nucleoli isolated by the polyamine procedure. We found that rDNA chromatin migrates as a single band in agarose gels, well separated from other components in the chromatin preparation. Although the utility of this technique is somewhat limited by low yields and by progressive stripping of protein from rDNA chromatin, it can provide useful information about rDNA chromatin protein composition. The application of this technique to the fractionation of gene and spacer chromatin fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion is discussed. We also found that rDNA chromatin, if RNase-treated, bands discretely in metrizamide equilibrium density gradients with a density lighter than that of non-nucleolar chromatin. These characteristics suggest that we have identified a transcriptionally active rDNA chromatin fraction which possesses a lower protein to DNA ratio than does non-nucleolar chromatin. This technique yields sufficient purified rDNA chromatin for further biochemical studies and does not cause extensive protein stripping. The procedures developed here should be applicable to the analysis of a variety of chromatin fractions in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1536064834,"Microtubules at steady state were found to undergo dramatic changes in length, with only very little change in number concentration and mean length. This result is accounted for by a mechanism in which microtubules are capped at ends by tubulin-GTP subunits; loss of the tubulin-GTP cap at one end results in disassembly of all the tubulin-GDP subunits, so that the medial edge of the distal tubulin-GTP cap is exposed; the exposed tubulin-GTP cap is sufficiently stable, so that microtubule regrowth from the cap rather than loss of the cap occurs. This mechanism predicts that a bell-shaped length distribution of sheared microtubules will be transiently bimodal, with peaks of short and moderate length microtubules, in rearranging to an exponential length distribution. We have observed the predicted transient bimodal length distribution experimentally and in a Monte Carlo simulation. Dynamic instability has recently been accounted for by assuming that microtubule ends are capped with only a single tubulin-GTP subunit at each end of the five helices that serve as elongation sites. Such a minimal tubulin-GTP cap is apparently ruled out by our observations, which require that the remnant tubulin-GTP cap generated from disassembly be able to serve as nucleating site; we do not expect that a stable nucleating site can be generated from five tubulin-GTP subunits, oriented as the five helices that serve as elongation sites."
