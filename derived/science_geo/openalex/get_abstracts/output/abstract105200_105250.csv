https://openalex.org/W1970677867,"2-5A-dependent RNase is an interferon-inducible enzyme that requires 5′-phosphorylated, 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) for its endoribonuclease activity against single-stranded RNAs. We demonstrate here that recombinant, human 2-5A-dependent RNase forms stable homodimers during its stimulation by 2-5A. The protein dimers were observed to form only upon binding to 2-5A, as shown using gel filtration chromatography and chemical cross-linking and after centrifugation in glycerol gradients. A monoclonal antibody to 2-5A-dependent RNase was prepared and used to probe the subunit structure of the enzyme in the presence or absence of 2-5A. Using oligoadenylates of different length, structure, and 5′-phosphorylation states we determined that conversion of 2-5A-dependent RNase from its monomeric, inactive form to its homodimeric, active form required the presence of functional 2-5A. These results demonstrate that the catalytically active form of 2-5A-dependent RNase is a homodimer."

Factor V was purified to homogeneity from plasma of two unrelated patients (patient I, factor VI, and patient II, factor VII), who are homozygous for this mutation. The factor V molecule from both patients has normal procoagulant activity when compared with factor V isolated from normal plasma in both a clotting time-based assay and in an assay measuring α-thrombin formation. The cleavage and subsequent inactivation by activated protein C (APC) of the α-thrombin-activated membrane-bound cofactor (factor Va) from both patients were analyzed and compared with the cleavage and inactivation of normal human factor Va. In normal factor Va, cleavage at Arg506 generates a Mr = 75,000 fragment and a Mr = 28,000/26,000 doublet and is necessary for the optimum exposure of the sites for subsequent cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679. Proteolysis at these sites leads to the appearance of Mr = 45,000 and 30,000 fragments and a Mr = 22,000/20,000 doublet. Cleavage at Arg506 is membrane-dependent and is required for complete inactivation. Following 5 min of incubation with APC (5.4 nM) membrane-bound normal factor Va (280 nM) has virtually no cofactor activity whereas under similar experimental conditions factor VaI and factor VaII retain approximately 50% of their initial activity. After 1 h of incubation with APC, factor VaI retains 20% of its initial cofactor activity whereas factor VaII has 10% remaining cofactor activity. The initial loss in cofactor activity (∼70%) of membrane-bound factor VaI and factor VaII during the first 10 min of the inactivation reaction is correlated with cleavage at Arg506 and appearance of a Mr = 45,000 fragment and a Mr = 62,000/60,000 doublet. Subsequently, the Mr = 62,000/60,000 doublet is cleaved at Arg679 to generate a Mr = 56,000/54,000 doublet resulting in complete loss of cofactor activity. Both procofactors, factor VI and factor VII, were inactivated following cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679, with APC inactivation rates equivalent to those observed for normal factor V. Our data demonstrate that: 1) cleavage at Arg506 is required for optimum exposure of the cleavage sites at Arg506 and Arg679 and rapid inactivation of membrane-bound factor Va; and 2) cleavage at Arg506 by APC on membrane-bound factor V occurs at the same rate in both normal and APC-resistant individuals. Thus cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679 and subsequent inactivation of the membrane-bound procofactor, factor V, does not require prior cleavage at Arg506 for optimum exposure.

Thus cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679 and subsequent inactivation of the membrane-bound procofactor, factor V, does not require prior cleavage at Arg506 for optimum exposure. The generation of α-thrombin is a central event of the blood coagulation process. This enzyme is generated by the catalyst prothrombinase, which is composed of factor Xa and its cofactor factor Va associated on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+. Factor V is a single chain procofactor molecule of Mr = 330,000, which is activated during blood clotting to factor Va, by factor Xa and/or α-thrombin(1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The active cofactor, factor Va, purified from human plasma, is composed of a heavy chain (Mr = 105,000) containing the NH2-terminal part of the procofactor (residues 1-709, A1-A2 domains) and a light chain (Mr = 74,000) containing the COOH-terminal part of the factor V molecule (amino acids 1546-2196, A3-C1-C2 domains)(1Mann K.G.

Resistance to APC is defined as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC in a clotting assay like-activated partial thromboplastin time(8Dahlback B. Carlsson M. Svensson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that APC resistance is the most common identifiable defect among patients with deep venous thrombosis (8Dahlback B. Carlsson M. Svensson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 9Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. de Ronde H. Brie T.E. Vandenbroucke J.P. Bertina R.M.

The abnormal response to APC has been linked to a plasma protein, which was identified as factor V because when purified human plasma factor V at 4 times the normal plasma concentration (76 nM) was added to the plasma from a patient with severe APC resistance, the patient's plasma recovered its APC sensitivity(11Dahlback B. Hildebrand B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It was thus concluded that factor V acts as a cofactor for the APC anticoagulant pathway(11Dahlback B. Hildebrand B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The molecular defect in APC-resistant patients was recently identified in several laboratories as a single point mutation at nucleotide 1691 in the factor V gene (G → A substitution) predicting a single amino acid substitution in the factor V molecule, Arg506→ Gln(12Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar, 13Rosendaal F.R. Bertina R.M.

Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1361-1362Abstract PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, the bulk of data demonstrate that APC resistance is due to an abnormal factor V molecule rather than to a deficiency of a cofactor for APC as initially proposed (11Dahlback B. Hildebrand B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that the mutant factor V is defective with respect to the APC cofactor activity of the protein S/factor V mixture during factor VIIIa inactivation (17Shen L. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cannot yet be excluded. The present study was undertaken in order to examine the APC-mediated inactivation of the factor V molecule that does not possess a cleavage site for APC at amino acid residue 506. Hepes, soybean trypsin inhibitor, Sepharose CL-4B, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine (PS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (PC) were purchased from Sigma. The chemiluminescent substrate, Luminol, was from DuPont NEN. Normal human factor V, human prothrombin, and human α-thrombin were purified as described(18Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S.

Human factor Va heavy chain that was used as an immunogen for the generation of the monoclonal antibody used in the present study was prepared as described(19Kalafatis M. Krishnaswamy S. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody αHFVaHC#6 was prepared as described(22Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody recognizes an epitope between amino acid residues 307-506 of the factor V molecule. The fluorescent thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide(23Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), human plasma APC(24Kisiel W. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and human factor Xa (21Bajaj S.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7729-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were provided by Paul Haley (Haematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT). The α-thrombin inhibitor hirudin was from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Phospholipid vesicles composed of 75% PC and 25% PS were prepared as previously reported(25Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in a buffer composed of 20 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS(Ca2+)). In the Leiden thrombophilia study (9Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. de Ronde H. Brie T.E. Vandenbroucke J.P. Bertina R.M. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1503-1506Abstract PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 13Rosendaal F.R. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1289-1290Abstract Scopus (6) Google Scholar) nine patients with deep vein thrombosis were identified that are homozygous for the G1691→ A substitution in the factor V gene (resulting in one amino acid substitution, Arg506→ Gln in the factor V molecule). Plasma was obtained in Leiden by manual plasmapheresis from two unrelated patients (patient I (90) and patient II (173)) after informed consent of the patients. Both patients were females, homozygous for the mutation (genotype 1691 AA), possessing normal levels of protein C and protein S. The APC-sensitivity ratio was 1.13 for patient 90 and 1.14 for patient 173. Plasma was collected on ACD (0.33% citric acid, 2.2% trisodium citrate, and 2.24% glucose). Directly after collection, the plasma was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g (at 4°C) to render it platelet free. Following addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml) the plasma was frozen in 50-ml aliquots and stored at −80°C until use. None of the patients was using oral anticoagulants at the time of plasmapheresis. Single chain factor V from the two unrelated patients was obtained following a previously described method with the omission of the phenyl-Sepharose column(18Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), using an anti-factor Va light chain monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose CL-4B. Human factor V or α-thrombin-activated factor V (factor Va) in HBS(Ca2+) were incubated with APC in the presence of PC•PS vesicles. The concentrations of all reagents are given in the figure legends. At selected time intervals aliquots of the mixture were assayed for activity as described(7Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). At the same time intervals the factor V/factor Va samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). When studying factor V inactivation the potential of contaminating α-thrombin in the APC preparations was controlled by addition of hirudin. All gels were produced according to the method described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue. In some experiments the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44481) Google Scholar) and probed with the monoclonal antibody αHFVaHC#6 as recently detailed (28Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the chemiluminescent substrate Luminol. NH2-terminal sequencing of the patient's factor V and factor Va fragments from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed as described (7Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the laboratory of Dr. Alex Kurosky (University of Texas, Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX). Normal plasma factor V, factor VI, and factor VII in the presence of PC•PS vesicles demonstrate similar cofactor activity (∼750 nM IIa/min) following 15 min of incubation with α-thrombin. Following 5 min of incubation with APC, normal factor Va lost 95% of the heavy chain and virtually all of its cofactor activity (Fig. 1 and 2A). The pattern of cofactor activity loss corresponds to cleavage at Arg506, followed by cleavage at Arg306 and Arg679(6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . These cleavages result in the appearance of fragments of Mr = 45,000 and 30,000 and a doublet of Mr = 22,000/20,000 (Fig. 2A, where the Mr = 75,000 fragment intermediate of the inactivation process (lanes5 and 6) and the Mr = 30,000 fragment (lanes5-11) are detected). For the patient's factor Va, under similar experimental conditions, following 5 min of incubation of APC, the loss of approximately 90% of the heavy chain corresponds to a 50% loss in cofactor activity (Fig. 1, inset; Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6; and Fig. 2B, lanes 5-7). The complete disappearance of the heavy chain of the cofactor when using patient's factor Va corresponds to cleavage at Arg306 as determined by amino acid sequencing of the corresponding fragments. Cleavage at that position results in the generation of a Mr = 45,000 fragment and of a Mr = 62,000/60,000 doublet (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). Subsequently, complete loss in cofactor activity correlates with cleavage of the Mr = 62,000/60,000 doublet at Arg679 and generation of a Mr = 56,000/54,000 doublet (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-13). The position of the cleavage site at Arg679 is deduced from our previous findings (6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from the fact that the fragments of Mr = 62,000 and 56,000 have the same NH2-terminal sequence starting at amino acid residue 307, suggesting a precursor-product relationship. Thus, the difference between the two fragments resides at the COOH terminus. These results were confirmed using a monoclonal antibody directed against the heavy chain of the cofactor that recognizes an epitope located between residues 307-506 of the cofactor. In normal factor Va, during inactivation by APC, this antibody recognizes the Mr = 30,000 fragment (Fig. 2A), whereas when studying factor VaI inactivation, the antibody recognizes the Mr = 62,000/60,000 and 56,000/54,000 doublets (which contain the region 307-709 and 307-679, respectively, of the factor Va heavy chain) (Fig. 2B). Thus, it must be concluded that cleavage only at Arg679 is responsible for the loss of approximately 30% in cofactor activity. Thus, cleavage at Arg506 is necessary for optimum exposure of the cleavage sites at Arg306 and Arg679, which in turn are required for cofactor inactivation (Fig. 1, filled circles). In the absence of the cleavage site at Arg506 the rate of inactivation of factor Va is slower than that observed for normal factor Va (Fig. 1, filled triangles and filled squares).Figure 2:Analysis of factor Va inactivation by APC.

These data confirm our previous findings that optimum cleavage at Arg506 on the membrane-bound procofactor does not require prior cleavage at Arg506(6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the proteolytic fragments deriving from membrane-bound factor VII following digestion by APC showed the appearance of a Mr = 45,000 fragment, which is produced slightly faster than the Mr = 54,000 fragment (Fig. 3B). NH2-terminal sequence of the two fragments demonstrated that the Mr = 45,000 fragment has the same NH2 terminus as factor V, whereas the Mr = 54,000 fragment has an NH2-terminal sequence matching a portion of factor V starting at amino acid residue 307. These data were confirmed using the monoclonal antibody that recognizes the epitope located between amino acid residues 307-506 of the cofactor. Following cleavage by APC the antibody recognizes the Mr = 30,000 fragment (Fig. 5A) from normal plasma factor V, whereas for factor VI inactivation, the antibody recognizes the Mr = 54,000 fragment (Fig. 5B). Altogether these data lead to the conclusion that cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679 occurs almost simultaneously during inactivation of membrane-bound factor VI and factor VII.Figure 5:Analysis of factor V inactivation by APC. The samples assayed for activity in Fig. 4(normal plasma factor V and factor VI) were also analyzed on a 4-15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE.

The position of the molecular weight markers is indicated at left of panelA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inactivation of membrane-bound normal factor Va is an ordered and sequential event with the first cleavage occurring at Arg506 of the heavy chain (Fig. 6). This is followed by cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679, which results in loss of cofactor activity. The Mr = 75,000 fragment, which is the consequence of cleavage at Arg506, is therefore an intermediate in the inactivation process (Fig. 6). Our data demonstrate that membrane-bound factor Va from patients with APC resistance lacking the cleavage site at Arg506 is still inactivated following cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679 (Fig. 6). However, the rate of inactivation is slower than in the normal molecule. Thus, cleavage at Arg506 appears to promote, but is not essential for, cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679. In contrast, no differences in the inactivation rates are observed when studying inactivation of membrane-bound factor V from normal or APC-resistant individuals. Direct activity measurements, NH2-terminal sequencing, and immunoblotting experiments confirmed our previous findings (6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, whereas rapid inactivation of membrane-bound factor Va requires cleavage at Arg506 prior to cleavage at Arg506 and Arg679, membrane-bound human factor V does not require prior cleavage at Arg506 for inactivation. Since inactivation by APC of only the abnormal factor Va, not factor V, is retarded (hence factor Va lingers at the place of vascular injury) and since individuals with Arg506→ Gln mutation have a poor anticoagulant response to APC, which in turn is associated with an increase in risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (7-fold increase for the heterozygous and 80-fold increase for the homozygous)(29Rosendaal F.R. Koster T. Vandenbroucke J.P. Reitsma P.H. Blood. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), it is likely that the primary physiological substrate for APC in vivo is factor Va, not factor V. Recent data demonstrate that, in the absence of a membrane surface, while no cleavage at Arg506 occurs, factor Va is cleaved at Arg506 followed by cleavage at Arg679 resulting in loss of approximately 30% of cofactor activity(6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that cleavage at Arg506 on the membrane-bound cofactor is impaired when using recombinant APC with the Glu20→ Ala substitution (APCγ20A). Impaired cleavage at Arg506 results in a cofactor that is cleaved at Arg506 and Arg679 and still possesses 60% cofactor activity(30Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Long G.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 687-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present data, obtained using a factor V molecule that does not possess a cleavage site for APC at position 506, together with our previous findings (6Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Long G.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 687-690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that: 1) cleavage at Arg506 on the membrane-bound cofactor is responsible for the loss in approximately 70% of cofactor activity; 2) cleavage at Arg679, which is lipid-independent, is responsible for loss in the remaining (30%) cofactor activity. The overall data indicate that cleavage at Arg506 alone in normal factor Va has no consequence on cofactor activity; however, this cleavage is necessary for efficient exposure of the cleavage sites at Arg506 and Arg679, which are associated with cofactor inactivation. In the absence of cleavage at Arg506 the inactivation process proceeds at a significantly reduced rate. The study of the plasma from patients with APC resistance has been the subject recently of intense investigation worldwide. Surprisingly, the bulk of functional data generated has created much confusion among the scientific community rather than understanding(31Bokarewa M. Blomback M. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 395-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Alhenc-Gelas M. Gandrille S. Aubry M-L. Emmerich J. Fiessinger J-N. Aiach M.

Cocceri S. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1289Abstract Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It has even been proposed that APC resistance may have disappeared with time in certain patients(35Girolami A. Simioni P. Scarano L. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1288-1289Abstract PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The possibility of an acquired and transient APC resistance has also been proposed(36Legnani C. Palareti G. Biagi R. Cocceri S. Lancet. 1994; 343: 1289Abstract Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our data may explain some of these assay discrepancies. It is preferable that individuals that suffered a thrombotic event should first be screened for the mutation as suggested (32Alhenc-Gelas M. Gandrille S. Aubry M-L. Emmerich J. Fiessinger J-N. Aiach M. Lancet. 1994; 343: 555-556Abstract PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by DNA analysis and the results confirmed by the APC resistance assay. Finally, it is important to recognize that APC resistance (by clotting assay) is observed in healthy individuals (5% of the population) carrying the Arg506→ Gln mutation, who do not present symptoms of deep vein thrombosis(9Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. de Ronde H. Brie T.E. Vandenbroucke J.P. Bertina R.M. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1503-1506Abstract PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 12Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R.

Lancet. 1994; 343: 1289-1290Abstract Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is well known that a single hit is in general insufficient to promote thrombosis. Thus, the existence of other (perhaps compensatory) mutations in the factor V gene that can influence APC sensitivity (i.e. alterations in the lipid binding sites of factor V or in the APC binding sites of the cofactor or a mutation in the phosphorylation site at Ser692 or a mutation that changes the three-dimensional structure of factor V) cannot and should not be excluded. We express our gratitude to Alex Kurosky and Steve Smith from the University of Texas, Medical Branch at Galveston, for NH2-terminal sequencing of factor V fragments from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and to Paul Haley for providing purified plasma human factor Xa and human APC. We thank Scott Doscher for excellent technical assistance."

In Escherichia coli, the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I is involved in the removal of RNA primers attached to the 5′-end of newly replicated DNA. The E. coli polA ex1 mutant is defective in 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity and is temperature-sensitive for growth. The joining of Okazaki fragments is retarded in the polA ex1 mutant, and as a consequence, it exhibits elevated levels of genetic recombination (1Konrad E.B. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 5′- to 3′-exonuclease was essential for the production of replicating form I DNA. A 5′- to 3′-exonuclease from mouse cells has also been shown to be required in a polα-primase-dependent replication that used single-stranded circular DNA as a template(5Goulian M. Richards S.H.

Both of these studies indicated that the removal of RNA primers required the combined action of RNase H and 5′- to 3′-exonuclease. In another study(6Turchi J.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The mouse and human 5′- to 3′-exonuclease genes have been cloned, and they encode highly homologous proteins of 378 and 380 amino acids, respectively(8Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Both proteins share a high degree of homology with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein of 382 amino acids encoded by the YKL510 open reading frame(8Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). All these exonucleases share homology with the S. cerevisiae and human nucleotide excision repair proteins RAD2 and XPG, respectively. Both the RAD2 and XPG proteins contain DNA endonuclease and 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activities(10Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31342-31345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

RAD2 and XPG, however, are much larger proteins containing 1031 and 1186 residues, respectively, and the homology between RAD2/XPG and the above noted mammalian and yeast 5′- to 3′-exonucleases occurs in three regions(8Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Scherly D. Nouspikel T. Corlet J. Ucla C. Bairoch A. Clarkson S.G.

Because of the homology of the S. cerevisiae YKL510 open reading frame encoded protein with RAD2, we have named the gene contained within the YKL510 DNA fragment RTH1 (RAD two homolog). The strict dependence of reconstituted mammalian DNA replication systems on the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease suggested that RTH1 may be an essential gene. To define the biological role of RTH1, we have examined the effects of a null mutation in RTH1 on viability, cell cycle morphology, and spontaneous mitotic recombination. We find that the rth1Δ mutation is conditionally lethal, and at the restrictive temperature, mutant cells exhibit a cell cycle morphology characteristic of mutants defective in DNA replication. The plasmid pR2.10, a derivative of pUC19, was used to make a genomic deletion of the RTH1 gene. pR2.10 contains the RTH1 gene in which nucleotides +58 to +755 of the RTH1 1146 nucleotide open reading frame (15Jacquier A. Legrain P. Dujon B. Yeast. 1992; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been replaced with the yeast URA3 gene flanked by Salmonella typhimurium HisG sequences(16Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). An rth1Δ mutation was made by the gene replacement technique (17Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) by cutting pR2.10 with EcoRI and SalI and transforming yeast cells to Ura+. Genomic deletion mutations of RTH1 and various RAD genes were constructed in S. cerevisiae strains EMY6 (MATα ade5 his7 leu2 lys1 met14 trp1Δ ura3) and LP3041-6D (MATaleu2-3 leu2-112 trp1Δ ura3-52). Quantification of survival after UV irradiation of yeast strains was carried out as described(18Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown from single colonies to stationary phase in the appropriate selection media. Cells were sonicated for 1-3 min in a Branson water bath sonicator, diluted, and plated on the appropriate medium. Plates were exposed to UV irradiation, incubated at 25, 30, or 34°C for 3-5 days in the dark to avoid photoreactivation, and the colonies were counted. For γ-ray irradiation, RTH1 and rth1Δ strains were suspended in U-wells and transferred to yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) 1The abbreviations used are: YPDyeast extract-peptone-dextroseMMSmethyl methanesulfonate. plates. Following irradiation with a cobalt-60 source at a dose rate of 9 kilorads/min, plates were incubated at either 25, 30, or 34°C for 3-4 days and examined at regular intervals. yeast extract-peptone-dextrose methyl methanesulfonate. RTH1 and rth1Δ strains were transferred to YPD plates containing either no MMS or MMS concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.035%. Plates were incubated at 25, 30, or 34°C for 4-5 days and examined. The his3Δ3′, his3Δ5′ duplication was constructed in wild type strains LP3041-6D, EMY6, and their rth1Δ derivatives by introducing the plasmid pRS6, which contains an internal fragment of the HIS3 gene, the LEU2 gene, and pBR322 sequences. Integration of pRS6 at the genomic HIS3 site results in two copies of the his3 gene, one with a terminal deletion at the 3′-end and the other with a terminal deletion at the 5′-end. The two his3 alleles are separated by LEU2 and pBR322 sequences(19Schiestl R.H. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Three 10-ml cultures were grown to a density of 107 cells/ml at either 25, 30, or 34°C in synthetic liquid medium lacking leucine. As nearly all of the HIS3+ recombinants show a simultaneous loss of the LEU2 gene and pBR322 sequences, HIS3+ recombinants do not divide in medium lacking leucine. Therefore, the frequency of HIS3+ recombinants measures the actual recombination rate. Log phase cultures were washed, resuspended in 1 ml of sterile water, diluted, and plated onto synthetic complete media to determine viability and onto synthetic complete media lacking histidine to determine the frequency of HIS3+ recombinants. Plates were incubated for 3-4 days at 25, 30, or 34°C, and the frequency of HIS3+ recombinants was determined. Recombination rates were calculated by the method of median of Lea and Coulson (as described previously in (19Schiestl R.H. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3619-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Doubling times were determined from growth curves obtained for the various yeast strains at 30°C in liquid YPD medium. Cultures were diluted to A600 of about 0.05, and the densities followed to A600 of 4-5. For growth at 37°C, cultures were divided with half of the culture left at 30°C and the other half shifted to 37°C and A600 determined at various times. For examining terminal morphology at 37°C, following ethanol fixation, cells were rehydrated in 40 mM KPO4, pH 6.5 buffer containing 0.5 M MgCl2 and 1.2 M sorbitol, and mounted on slides coated with 0.1% polylysine (Mr 400,000). For visualization of nuclear morphology, a drop of mounting medium containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole was applied to the slide, and cells were photographed with a Leitz Laborlux D fluorescence microscope equipped with an Olympus PM-10AD photomicrographic system. To test if RTH1 has a role in DNA repair, we examined the sensitivity of the rth1Δ mutant to ultraviolet irradiation, γ-irradiation, and the alkylating agent MMS. The rth1Δ mutation was constructed in two different yeast strains and their sensitivity to DNA damaging agents examined at three different temperatures, 25, 30, and 34°C. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the rth1Δ mutation has no effect on UV sensitivity. The UV sensitivity of the rth1Δ mutation, in combination with the rad2Δ mutation defective in nucleotide excision repair, is the same as that of the rad2Δ single mutation, suggesting that RTH1 has no significant role in the RAD6 postreplicative bypass or the RAD52 recombinational repair pathways, which, in addition to nucleotide excision repair, constitute the three pathways for the repair of UV damage in yeast(20Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We also found no effect of the rth1Δ mutation on γ-ray sensitivity (data not shown). Sensitivity to MMS was, however, enhanced by the rth1Δ mutation (Fig. 1C). When grown at 30°C, the rth1Δ mutation affects growth rate considerably, increasing the cell doubling time to twice to that in the wild type strain (Table 1). We also determined the growth rate of the rth1Δ mutation in combination with mutations in genes representing the three epistasis groups for the repair of UV damage in S. cerevisiae (Table 1). The growth rates of the rth1Δ rad2Δ and rth1Δ rad6Δ double mutants were about the same as that of the rth1Δ single mutant; the doubling time of the rth1Δ rad52Δ mutant was, however, about twice that of the rth1Δ or the rad52Δ single mutant, indicating that the RAD52 recombinational pathway plays an important role in repairing the DNA lesions that accumulate in the rth1Δ mutant.Tabled 1 The rth1Δ mutant stops growth upon transfer to 37°C (Fig. 2A). Microscopic examination revealed that rth1Δ mutant cells stop division as two large cells consisting of the mother and the daughter cell, with a block in nuclear division. In some cases, the nucleus has migrated to the neck between the two cells, whereas in other cases, cells exhibit an elongated nucleus stretching between the mother and daughter cell (Fig. 2B). The cell cycle arrest phenotype of the rth1Δ mutant resembles that of the various S. cerevisiae mutants known to be defective in DNA replication. For example, cdc2 mutants with a defect in DNA polymerase δ stop at the restrictive temperature with the nucleus that has migrated to the neck of the mother cell but has not elongated, whereas the DNA ligase defective mutant cdc9 stops cell division with an elongated nucleus extending between the two cells(21Culotti J. Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 67: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In E. coli, mutations in the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I and in DNA ligase confer a hyper recombination phenotype because of the retarded joining of Okazaki fragments(1Konrad E.B. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Konrad E.B. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 167-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Konrad E.B. Modrich P. Lehman I.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 77: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mutations in DNA replication genes encoding DNA ligase(23Montelone B.A. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DNA polymerases, and other enzymes (24Hartwell L.H. Smith D. Genetics. 1985; 110: 381-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also result in elevated rates of spontaneous mitotic recombination. The requirement of 5′- to 3′-exonuclease encoded by the mammalian counterparts of RTH1 in the completion of lagging strand synthesis in reconstituted DNA replication systems suggested that retarded joining of Okazaki fragments in rth1Δ mutant cells should result in an increased level of spontaneous mitotic recombination. To verify this, we examined the effect of the rth1Δ mutation on spontaneous mitotic intrachromosomal recombination between two his3 genes (his3Δ3′, his3Δ5′) in two different RAD+ strains and in their rth1Δ derivatives. As shown in Table 2, the rate of mitotic recombination is elevated 15-30-fold in the rth1Δ mutant.Tabled 1 In vitro reconstitution of the DNA replication machinery from different mammalian sources has indicated the requirement of a 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity in the completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis. RTH1 encodes the S. cerevisiae counterpart of the mammalian 5′- to 3′-exonuclease. In this study, we have determined the in vivo biological role of RTH1 by examining the effects of the rth1Δ mutation on viability, mitotic recombination, and DNA repair. We find that RTH1 is not an essential gene. However, growth rate is slowed very considerably in the rth1Δ mutant at the permissive temperature, and the rth1Δ mutation is inviable at the restrictive temperature of 37°C. These results suggest the presence of an alternate 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity that, at the permissive temperature, can substitute for the activity missing in the rth1Δ mutant; however, at the elevated temperature, the other 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity is unable to support DNA replication. Because of the homology of RTH1-encoded protein with the S. cerevisiae RAD2 protein and the fact that RAD2 also possesses a 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity(10Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31342-31345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the effect of the rad2Δ mutation on viability in combination with the rth1Δ mutation. However, the rad2Δ mutation has no effect on viability or growth rate of the rth1Δ mutation, indicating that RAD2 does not fulfill the role of the alternate 5′- to 3′-exonuclease in DNA replication. As expected for a mutant defective in DNA replication, the rth1Δ mutant stops division at the restrictive temperature as two large cells with a defect in nuclear division. At the permissive temperature, the rth1Δ mutation results in a reduction in growth rate, and a further decline in growth rate occurs in the rth1Δ rad52Δ double mutant. A slowdown in the removal of RNA primers in the rth1Δ mutant would retard the joining of nascent DNA fragments; subsequent channeling of these discontinuities into the RAD52 recombinational repair pathway would result in elevated levels of spontaneous mitotic recombination observed in the rth1Δ mutant. Elimination of recombinational repair by the rad52Δ mutation would leave the DNA lesions in the rth1Δ mutant unrepaired, resulting in a further reduction in growth rate of rth1Δ rad52Δ mutant strain over that of the rth1Δ and rad52Δ single mutants. We have shown previously that DNA ligase-deficient mutations are lethal in combination with mutations in the RAD52 gene(23Montelone B.A. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find no evidence for the involvement of RTH1 in the repair of UV damage. The rth1Δ mutation, however, confers sensitivity to MMS, suggesting a role for the RTH1 5′- to 3′-exonuclease in the repair of alkylation damage. Following removal of the alkylated base by a DNA glycosylase and subsequent cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the 5′-side of the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) residue by a class II AP endonuclease, the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease could effect the release of the AP residue, resulting in a 1-nucleotide gap, which could then be filled in by repair synthesis."

In contrast to normal E. coli cells, cells producing cytosolic TesA synthesize large amounts of free fatty acid at all stages of growth. Moreover, cultures of the cytosolic TesA-producing strain continue lipid synthesis (as free fatty acid) in stationary phase whereas lipid synthesis is normally strongly inhibited in such cultures.

Surprisingly, production of cytosolic thioesterase I gave only modest inhibition of membrane phospholipid synthesis. These results demonstrate that internalization of a normally secreted enzyme can disrupt normal cellular regulatory mechanisms. The periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria contains several hydrolytic enzymes that function to degrade complex molecules to simpler forms suitable for transport across the inner membrane and subsequent metabolism. If retained in the cytosol most of these enzymes (if active) seem likely to be toxic, since the enzymes would hydrolyze metabolic intermediates and other essential molecules. To our knowledge Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) is the only such scavenging enzyme that has been trapped in the cytosol (due to deletion of the leader sequence)(1Demain A.I. Puziss P.J. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, cytosolic PhoA is completely inactive due to lack of a disulfide bond essential for activity. Mutants deficient in thioredoxin reductase (selected by suppression of the loss of metabolically essential specific phosphatases) allow some disulfide bond formation within the cytosol (2Demain A.I. Puziss P.J. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these strains survive the presence of cytosolic alkaline phosphatase. Survival could be due to the low levels of cytosolic phosphatase (2Demain A.I. Puziss P.J. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and/or to low activity in vivo. For example, alkaline phosphatase is severely inhibited by inorganic phosphate(3Reid T. Wilson I.B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol. IV. Academic Press, New York1971: 373-415Google Scholar), which is present in high concentration in the E. coli cytosol(4Schulman R.G. Brown T.R. Ugurbil K.

We report another consequence of trapping a periplasmic enzyme in the E. coli cytosol, loss of regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The periplasmic enzyme is thioesterase I, an enzyme that cleaves the thioester bonds of acyl-CoA and the acylated protein intermediates of fatty acid and complex lipid synthesis(5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TesA is a monomeric protein lacking cysteine residues (5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus does not require dimer and disulfide bond formation as does PhoA. The E. coli B strain, BL21 (ompT r3- mBi) (7Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-89Google Scholar) together with K-12 strains LE392 (hsdR supE44 supF metB1 lacY galK), UB1005 (metB relA gyrA), and HC71 (a fadE62 Tn10 derivative of LE392(6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to study the physiological effects of ′TesA production. The TesA leader sequence was deleted from the tesA gene by site-directed mutagenesis (8Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) of pHC61(5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PstI site was introduced into pHC61 immediately upstream of the leader peptidase cleavage site by conversion of base 75, C to T, using the oligonucleotide 5′CCGTGCCGCTGCAGCGGAC3′ (mutation underlined) to give plasmid pHC121. This plasmid was digested with PstI, and the released insert was then resected to blunt ends and digested with XbaI. Vector plasmid pBAD22 (9Guzman L.-M. Barondess J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7716-7728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI, and the resulting 5′ overhang was filled in. After digestion with XbaI the vector was then ligated to the above 553-base pair fragment resulting in pHC122. Plasmids pHC122 and pBAD22 were transformed into strain HC71 to give strains HC125 and HC123, respectively. Plasmid pHC123 was a derivative of pET16b (Novagen) carrying ′TesA under the control of a T7 promoter. This plasmid was constructed by ligation of the NcoI-SalI tesA fragment of pHC122 to NcoI-XhoI-digested pET16b and was transformed into strain BL21 to give strain HC141. Strain HC140 was strain BL21 carrying pET16b. The defined medium was medium M9 (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% casein hydrolysate and 0.4% succinate. Arabinose and glucose were added to 0.4% and sodium ampicillin to 100 μg/ml. Lipids were extracted and analyzed, and enzyme activities were measured as described previously(5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rawlings M.

Reversed phase chromatography was done on C18 bonded thin layer plates (Whatman) developed with acetonitrile:acetic acid:acetone (7:1:1, by volume). The other methods of lipid analysis (12Christie W.W. Lipid Analysis. 2nd Ed. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982Google Scholar) and the methods for recombinant DNA manipulations were standard(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Thioesterase I of E. coli is encoded by the tesA gene and is normally found in the cell periplasm(5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon overproduction a measurable level of TesA activity is found in the cytosol(6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably due to the titration of a limiting cellular component(s) needed for export to the periplasm. Cells overproducing TesA accumulated small amounts of free fatty acids (FFA)1, an indication of thioesterase action(6Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1793-1795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We deleted the leader sequence of the protein in order to trap the active enzyme within the cytosol with the expectation that deletion of the leader sequence would not only retain more TesA protein in the cytosol but also should increase the specific activity of the cytosolic enzyme because leader sequences retard protein folding(13Park S. Liu G. Topping B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Moreover, removal of the leader sequence could increase the access of substrates to the TesA active site, which lies only 8 residues from the site of signal sequence cleavage(5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA segment encoding the tesA leader was precisely deleted by oligonucleotide mutagenesis resulting in a gene encoding an altered protein (called ′TesA) in which the N-terminal alanine of mature TesA (5Cho H. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9238-9245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was adjacent to the initiator methionine residue, which would be removed (14Hirel P. Schmitter J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 91: 8247-8251Crossref Scopus (665) Google Scholar) to give a facsimile of the periplasmic form. It seemed likely that production of high cytosolic levels of TesA thioesterase activity might inhibit cell growth, and, therefore, we expressed the altered tesA gene from the tightly controlled araBAD promoter. In the absence of arabinose, a strain carrying the ′TesA-encoding plasmid showed only a 6-fold increase in total thioesterase activity (over that encoded by the chromosomal tesA and tesB genes), whereas arabinose induction resulted in an 80-fold increase in thioesterase activity. As expected, 97% of the thioesterase activity of the induced cells was found in the cytosol. The periplasmic fraction of these cells had a 7-fold increased thioesterase activity, suggesting export of a small fraction of ′TesA (1Demain A.I. Puziss P.J. Bassford Jr., P.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Bowden G.A. Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 174: 3407-3410Crossref Google Scholar). Although the induced cells accumulated large amounts of a normally periplasmic enzyme in the cytosol, the cultures grew normally. The efficiency of colony formation was the same on media with or without arabinose. However, colonies formed on arabinose media had abnormally diffuse morphologies resembling granular and irregular “fried eggs.” We later were able to attribute this altered morphology to decreased surface tension of the agar caused by production of FFA (see below). Addition of a nonionic detergent to the agar resulted in colonies of normal morphology. We transformed plasmid pHC122 encoding the ′TesA protein into a strain (fadE) defective in β-oxidation (to block degradation of FFA) and assayed lipid synthesis by labeling with [1-14C]acetate. Stationary phase cultures containing ′TesA synthesized large amounts of FFA (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), whereas only traces of FFA were found in cultures either lacking the ′TesA gene or in which expression of the gene was repressed (Fig. 1). Exponentially growing cultures (in which rapid phospholipid synthesis occurred) synthesized less FFA, whereas cultures in the transition between log and stationary phases synthesized an intermediate level (Fig. 2). Unexpectedly most (>90%) FFA was found in the culture medium rather than within the cells, although the cells remained intact as indicated by turbidity, colony-forming ability, and metabolic activity. The rate of FFA production exceeded the capacity of the fad (β-oxidation) pathway to degrade the acids, since similar accumulations of FFA were seen in arabinose-induced wild type, fadE, and fadD strains carrying pHC122 (data not shown). Since the only acyl-CoA synthetic enzyme detectable in vivo is that encoded by fadD(16Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4281-4290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acyl-CoA does not play a role in FFA production. The phospholipid content of the ′TesA-producing strain (42 μmol of phospholipid/mg of protein) was somewhat lower than that of the strain carrying the vector plasmid (53 μmol of phospholipid/mg of protein), whereas the fatty acid compositions of the phospholipids were within the normal range (Table 1). The total amount of fatty acid (FFA plus phospholipid) accumulated by late stationary phase cultures of ′TesA-producing strains reached values 2.5-3-fold greater than those of parallel cultures lacking the mutant enzyme.Figure 1:Biosynthetic labeling of the chloroform/methanol-soluble lipids. Samples of cultures growing in RB medium containing 0.4% arabinose at 37°C were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature, washed once, and resuspended in the same volume of the identical medium. These cultures were then incubated with shaking at 37°C with 5 μCi of [1-14C]acetate per ml of culture. Following 10 min of labeling chloroform/methanol was added to the cultures, and lipids were extracted. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the labeled lipids was done by the double development procedure used previously(23Jiang P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lanes1 and 3 are the lipids of stationary phase cultures of the ′TesA-producing strain (HC125) whereas lanes2 and 5 are the lipids of parallel cultures of strain HC123, which lacked the ′TesA gene. Lane4 shows the lipids from a parallel culture of strain HC125 supplemented with glucose (which represses the araBAD promoter) rather than arabinose. FFA and P-lipids denote the free fatty acid and phospholipid fractions, respectively. The top edge of the uppermost phospholipid band (cardiolipin) defines the front of the second solvent system. The lower phospholipid spot is a mixture of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 In E. coli and most other bacteria, as well as in plants, fatty acid synthesis is catalyzed by a series of individual enzymes that act on the growing fatty acid chain linked to acyl carrier protein (ACP)(17Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fatty acid carboxyl group is in thioester linkage to the thiol of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of ACP. The source of FFA was deduced by analysis of the lengths of the acyl chains produced. Gas chromatographic analysis of the FFA fraction showed a distribution of acyl chains that was markedly different from those found in the phospholipids (Table 1). The FFA fraction was highly enriched in short chain fatty acids and contained a C14 unsaturated acid not present in the phospholipids. These analyses did not include acids of chain length <C12, since the methyl esters of such acids are volatile and difficult to recover. Therefore, we assayed for shorter acids by reverse phase chromatography of the free acids (which are much less volatile) and found significant amounts of the C10 acid (about 15% of the level of the C12 acid) and traces of the C8 acid in the FFA fraction. We could not detect either the C8 or C10 acids in the phospholipid fraction, consistent with the well established acyl chain composition of E. coli membrane lipids. The presence of acyl chains normally found in E. coli only as intermediates in the synthesis of the long chain acids indicates that FFA result from hydrolysis of the thioester bond linking the growing acyl chain to ACP. Trapping of ′TesA in the cytosol resulted in increased total fatty acid synthesis, particularly in stationary phase cultures. Indeed, in well buffered stationary phase cultures the rate of lipid synthesis (as FFA) could approach that of log phase cultures and was 12-15-fold higher than that seen in parallel cultures of strains lacking cytosolic ′TesA (Fig. 2). In stationary phase cultures lacking ′TesA the overall rate of lipid synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 2) as expected from prior work (18Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 2054-2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Peypoux F. Michel G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). (The residual synthetic rate can be attributed to the small fraction of growing cells present in stationary phase cultures.) Therefore, the presence of cytosolic ′TesA somehow bypassed the mechanism that inhibits lipid synthesis in stationary phase cultures. Two models are proposed. The first model proposes that the cleaved ′TesA substrate normally acts as a feedback inhibitor of a fatty acid synthetic enzyme(s), whereas the second model proposes that the cleaved substrate is a transcriptional corepressor regulating the production of fatty acid synthetic enzymes (analogous to the known regulation of E. coli fatty acid metabolism by acyl-CoA(17Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To discriminate between these models we assayed the dependence of ′TesA action on subsequent mRNA synthesis. The first model states that FFA production should be independent of protein (hence mRNA) synthesis following production of ′TesA, whereas the second model requires mRNA synthesis for the ′TesA effect. The expression of the ′TesA gene was placed under control of a phage T7 promoter(7Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-89Google Scholar), and production of ′TesA was triggered by addition of IPTG (which regulates both the synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase and function of the T7 promoter in this system). Following a brief period of T7 RNA polymerase synthesis E. coli mRNA synthesis was blocked by addition of rifampicin, a specific inhibitor of E. coli RNA polymerase (but not the T7 enzyme). Thus, synthesis of any proteins other than ′TesA required for FFA production would be blocked (as well as further synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase). Induction of T7 RNA polymerase gave the expected increase in ′TesA (>100-fold increase in total cellular thioesterase activity), and significant production of FFA was observed when rifampicin was added after only 5 min of T7 RNA polymerase induction (Fig. 3). The level of FFA subsequently produced was more than half of the levels of cultures in which rifampicin was added later following induction or was omitted (Fig. 3). Note that rifampicin addition immediately blocks initiation of mRNA synthesis by E. coli RNA polymerase (7Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 61-89Google Scholar) and that approximately 4 min is required to induce and reach the full rate of β-galactosidase synthesis(20Adamson L. Gross C. Novick A. Beckwith J.R. Zipser D. The Lactose Operon. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1970: 317-323Google Scholar, 21Alpers D.H. Tompkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It seems reasonable to expect that the kinetics of T7 RNA polymerase production were similar to those of β-galactosidase given that the proteins are of similar sizes (99 versus 110 kDa) and expressed from the same promoter. Since most of the 5 min allowed for synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase would be consumed in polymerase synthesis and the subsequent synthesis of the first few molecules of ′TesA, little (if any) time remained for protein synthesis in response to ′TesA production. It therefore follows that FFA production does not require subsequent synthesis of other proteins and ′TesA must act by altering the activity of enzymes present prior to ′TesA production. The most straightforward regulatory mechanism is that fatty acyl-ACPs, the acyl donors of complex lipid synthesis, accumulate when phospholipid synthesis slows upon cessation of cell growth. These accumulated acyl-ACP(s) then exert feedback inhibition on fatty acid synthesis at the level of enzyme activity. However, when high concentrations of thioesterase I are present in the cytosol, the inhibitory fatty acyl-ACP(s) are efficiently cleaved, and fatty acid synthesis continues. It was surprising that cytosolic expression of TesA failed to inhibit growth. Growth and complex lipid synthesis were essentially normal. The continued synthesis of lipid A and phospholipid in the presence of high levels of TesA indicated that the acyltransferases that transfer acyl chains from ACP to the precursors of these complex lipids successfully compete with ′TesA for acyl-ACP molecules. Our data also show that E. coli has the enzymatic capacity to synthesize significantly more lipid than the amounts normally produced. This result argues that (in the short term) the rate of E. coli lipid synthesis is not determined by the rate of synthesis of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes but rather by regulation of the activity of an enzyme or enzymes. Prior models suggested that the rate of phospholipid synthesis was strongly coupled to the availability of acyl-ACP substrates. These models were based on experiments showing that mutants or culture conditions that altered the rate of fatty acid synthesis also similarly changed the synthetic rates of phospholipid and lipid A (17Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these results are consistent with the feedback inhibition mechanism reported above. For example, it has long been known that the synthesis of fatty acid, phospholipid, and lipid A is similarly inhibited when E. coli accumulates guanosine-5′-diphosphate-3′-diphosphate (ppGpp)(17Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heath and co-workers (24Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that this inhibition is relieved by overexpression of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, the first enzyme of phospholipid synthesis. Thus, it is clear that the primary ppGpp effect is on phospholipid synthesis and that the effects on synthesis of the other lipids are secondary to blocking phospholipid synthesis. Moreover, acyltransferase overexpression was shown to prevent the accumulation of long chain acyl-ACPs(24Heath R.J. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data together with our results strongly suggest that the observed inhibition of fatty acid synthesis observed in cells containing ppGpp can be attributed to acyl-ACP accumulation. free fatty acid acyl carrier protein isopropyl-β-D-galactoside guanosine-5′-diphosphate-3′-diphosphate."

Within minutes of neurotransmitter release, the expression of a family of genes termed immediate early genes (IEGs) 1The abbreviations used are: IEGsimmediate early genesVSCCvoltage-sensitive Ca2+ channelCaRECa2+ response elementCREcAMP response elementCREBcAMP response element binding proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseCaMCa2+ calmodulinTPA12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetateSREserum response elementPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is induced in the post-synaptic neuron. Many IEGs encode transcription factors that then induce subsequent waves of late response gene expression. Late response genes encode proteins that are likely to be determinants of neuronal plasticity. These proteins may include neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes, neurotransmitter receptors, neurotrophins, as well as structural components of the synapse. immediate early genes voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel Ca2+ response element cAMP response element cAMP response element binding protein cAMP-dependent protein kinase Ca2+ calmodulin 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate serum response element polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One critical issue that remains to be solved is how a signal that is initiated by neurotransmitter release at the synapse is propagated to the nucleus of a post-synaptic cell to activate IEG transcription. Studies of one IEG, the c-fos proto-oncogene, have begun to give insight into this process. A variety of neurotransmitters that trigger Ca2+ influx have been found to stimulate c-fos transcription rapidly and transiently both in vitro in cell culture systems (3Bading H. Ginty D.D.

Neuron. 1990; 5: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The c-fos gene encodes a transcription factor, Fos, which forms a heterodimer with members of the Jun family of transcription factors and regulates the expression of late response genes that contain Fos/Jun-binding sites (consensus 5′-TGAG/CTCA-3′) within their promoters(10Curran T. Franza B.R.J. Cell. 1988; 55: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 has proven to be a useful model for elucidating the mechanisms by which neurotransmitters that trigger Ca2+ influx activate c-fos transcription. Exposure of PC12 cells to elevated levels of extracellular KCl depolarizes the plasma membrane and stimulates the opening of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs). The subsequent rise in the level of intracellular Ca2+ induces c-fos transcription(4Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Science. 1986; 234: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 11Morgan J.I. Curran T. Nature. 1986; 322: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). A Ca2+ response element (CaRE), located 60 nucleotides 5′ of the initiation site for c-fos mRNA synthesis, plays an important role in mediating the c-fos response to VSCC activation(12Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The −60 CaRE (-TGACGTTT-) is similar in sequence to a consensus cAMP response element (CRE) (-TGACGTCA-) present within the regulatory regions of a variety of genes that become activated when cells are exposed to agents such as forskolin that activate adenylate cyclase and stimulate cAMP production(13Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). When the c-fos CaRE/CRE is inserted within the promoter of reporter genes that are normally non-responsive to forskolin or VSCC channel activators the c-fos CaRE/CRE confers responsiveness to these agents. The −60 CaRE functions by interacting with the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) which becomes newly phosphorylated at a critical regulatory site, serine 133, within minutes of exposure of PC12 cells to elevated levels of KCl or forskolin(12Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serine 133 is critical for CREB-mediated transcription inasmuch as a mutation that converts serine 133 to an alanine inhibits CREB's ability to activate transcription in response to treatment with VSCC activators or forskolin(14Sheng M.E. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 15Gonzales G.A. Montminy M.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How phosphorylation of CREB serine 133 stimulates the ability of this transcription factor to induce gene expression is not completely resolved. While phosphorylation of serine 133 may enhance the binding of CREB to CREs that might otherwise bind it with low affinity(17Nichols M. Weih F. Schmid W. DeVack C. Kowenz-Leutz E. Luckow B. Boshart M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3337-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), the major effect of serine 133 phosphorylation is to increase CREB's ability to activate transcription once bound to the CaRE/CRE(14Sheng M.E. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Whether CREB phosphorylation regulates transcription by enhancing the rate of formation of new transcription complexes at the promoter (new initiation), or by affecting the efficiency with which transcription complexes transcribe the length of the c-fos gene (elongation) remains to be determined. Within minutes of its activation by neurotransmitters, expression of the c-fos gene is repressed(4Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. Science. 1986; 234: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The rapid disappearance of the c-fos mRNA reflects the fact that this mRNA has an extremely short half-life (18Shyu A.-B. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Genes &Dev. 1989; 3: 60-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) but is also a consequence of transcriptional repression. With respect to Ca2+ regulation of c-fos transcription, the mechanism of transcriptional shut-off has not been characterized. One possibility is that the −60 CaRE and its associated protein, CREB, mediate both the transcriptional activation and the subsequent shut-off event. Since the phosphorylation of CREB serine 133 triggers c-fos activation, the dephosphorylation of phosphoserine 133 might lead to the shut-off of c-fos transcription. An alternative possibility is that distinct promoter elements and transcription factors control the initial c-fos activation and subsequent shut-off events. The kinase(s) that catalyzes the phosphorylation event upon activation of the L-type VSCCs has been a subject of controversy. It is well established that in forskolin-treated cells elevated levels of cAMP lead to the activation of the cAMPdependent protein kinase (PKA) which then translocates to the nucleus where it almost certainly catalyzes the phosphorylation of CREB serine 133(15Gonzales G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 19Meinkoth J.L. Ji Y. Taylor S.S. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, PKA's involvement in the Ca2+ signaling pathway remains unresolved. Several studies suggest that membrane depolarization of PC12 cells does not effectively stimulate cAMP accumulation, suggesting that PKA is not likely to be activated and is probably not the enzyme that triggers CREB serine 133 phosphorylation under these conditions (12Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 21Nguyen T.V. Kobierski L. Comb M. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2825-2833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, a Ca2+-activated enzyme, such as a Ca2+-calmodulin dependent (CaM) kinase, was hypothesized to phosphorylate CREB in response to membrane depolarization. However, in another study using PKA-deficient cell lines, VSCC activation failed to effectively stimulate c-fos transcription, even though CaM kinases were activated(22Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. Bader D.S. Hidaka H. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17454-17458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggested that PKA activity is important for depolarization activation of c-fos transcription and that it might mediate CREB serine 133 phosphorylation. In this report, using the c-fos CaRE/CRE as a model, we have characterized further the signaling pathways by which VSCCs trigger gene expression. We have investigated the mechanism of transcriptional initiation and provide evidence suggesting that upon VSCC activation CREB phosphorylation leads to an increase in the rate of formation of new transcription complexes. In addition, these newly formed transcription complexes appear to have an increased efficiency of elongation through an intragenic transcription pause site. The mechanism of transcriptional shut-off that occurs subsequent to VSCC activation also has been characterized. Dephosphorylation of CREB was found to play a role in the down-regulation event. Furthermore, characterization of the signaling pathways by which VSCCs lead to CREB phosphorylation demonstrated that CREB phosphorylation is not mediated by PKA but is likely to be catalyzed by a Ca2+-activated kinase. While CREB serine 133 phosphorylation is necessary for Ca2+-induced CaRE/CRE-dependent transcription, it is not sufficient. In addition to CREB serine 133 phosphorylation, a second, PKA-dependent signaling pathway is also required for CREB-mediated transcriptional activation of c-fos.

To generate the 1S and 1AS constructs, pSP65r-fos (gift from T. Curran, Nutley, NJ) was digested with BglII and EcoRI and the 290-base pair fragment was then ligated into M13mp18 (for 1S) or M13mp19 (for 1AS) that had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI. For the 2S and 2AS constructs, pSP65r-fos was digested with BglI, blunted, and then digested with BstYI. The 461-base pair fragment was then ligated into either Mp13mp18 or Mp13mp19 digested with SmaI and BamHI. M13MATA contains a 720-base pair fragment from the mouse α-tubulin inserted into M13(23Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Genes &Dev. 1990; 4: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The PKA-deficient PC12derived cell line (123.7) stably expresses a mutant regulatory subunit of the PKA that does not bind cAMP(30Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol.

Both wild type and mutant PC12 cells were grown on collagen-coated plates in 10% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 0.01% penicillin, and 0.01% streptomyocin. The day before transfection, 5 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm poly-D-lysine-coated tissue culture plates. Plasmids were transfected by the Ca2+ phosphate technique (27Treisman R.

In the GAL4 experiments, an additional 5 μg of a GAL4 fusion plasmid was also transfected. Where indicated, PC12 cells were stimulated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (0.3 μg/ml), forskolin (10 μM), or KCl (60 mM). Concentrations in parentheses are the final concentrations in the growth media. For addition to growth media, TPA (stock solution was 1 mg/ml in Me2SO) was diluted to 100 times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, forskolin stock solution was 10 mM in ethanol, and KCl stock solution was 150 mM. In immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments, forskolin was diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before addition to cells. Total cytoplasmic RNA extraction and RNase protection analysis of transcripts from the human and rat c-fos and human α-globin genes have been described(26Sheng M. Dougan S.T. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Protection of fosCAT transcripts also has been described(29Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 4305-4315Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The α-globin riboprobe synthesized from the pT7α181 template was used to protect α-globin transcripts in the experiments where fosCAT constructs were transfected. Nuclei were isolated from PC12 cells as described(32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates, New York1987: 4.10.1-4.10.5Google Scholar), except that nuclei were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, recentrifuged, and resuspended in glycerol storage buffer for storage at −80°C until use. Nuclear run-on transcription reactions were performed as described(33Celano P. Berchtold C. Casero R.A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei were incubated at 30°C for 30 min with nucleotides, including 10 μl of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mM). Reactions were subsequently treated with DNase I and then proteinase K. RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanatephenol-choloroform procedure (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). RNA (equal numbers of incorporated counts/min) was hybridized for 36 h to DNA probes immobilized on nitrocellulose(23Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Genes &Dev. 1990; 4: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Following hybridization, filters were washed twice for 60 min at 65°C in 2 × SSC, once at 37°C for 30 min in 2 × SSC, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and once again at 37°C in 2 × SSC for 30 min. Hybridized RNA was detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots were performed as described(35Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Anti-CREB is rabbit antiserum directed against the first 205 amino acids of CREB fused to trpE(35Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). For immunoblots, a 1/5000 to 1/20000 dilution of affinity purified anti-CREB was used. Anti-phosphoCREB is a rabbit antiserum directed against the phosphorylated peptide, KRREILSRRPS(PO4)YRK (CREBtide)(35Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography and further purified by application to an affinity chromatography column containing unphosphorylated CREBtide. The concentration of the IgG fraction was 0.7 mg/ml. The IgG fraction or the affinity purified anti-phosphoCREB were used at dilutions of 1/5000 to1/20000 in immunoblotting analysis, and the IgG fraction was used at a 1/200 dilution in immunoprecipitations. The CaRE/CRE located at 60 nucleotides 5′ of the start site of c-fos mRNA synthesis plays an important role in mediating the effects of membrane depolarization and Ca2+ on c-fos transcription (12Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 26Sheng M. Dougan S.T. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). CREB, which binds the CaRE/CRE, becomes phosphorylated on serine 133 upon exposure of PC12 cells to elevated levels of KCl. This phosphorylation event has previously been shown to be necessary for transcriptional induction(14Sheng M.E. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). It has not been determined whether CREB phosphorylation regulates transcription by affecting the rate of initiation of new transcription at the promoter, or by increasing the elongation potential of previously initiated transcripts. To distinguish between these two possibilities, a nuclear run-on transcription assay was used to examine transcription along different regions of the endogenous rat c-fos gene in PC12 cells left untreated or exposed to elevated levels of KCl for varying periods of time. In the nuclear run-on assay, new transcription initiation does not occur, but transcripts that have initiated prior to cell lysis are elongated. The nuclear run-on transcription assay was performed in the presence of [32P]UTP, and the resulting RNA was hybridized to DNA probes bound to nitrocellulose filters. Two probes that hybridize to RNA transcribed from different regions of the c-fos gene were employed (Fig. 2A). Probe 1 consists of a rat cDNA fragment encompassing all of exon 1 and a very small (16 nucleotides) portion of exon 2. When probe 1 is used, hybridization of nuclear run-on transcripts to the 16 nucleotides of exon 2 sequences accounts for less than 10% of the total hybridization signal. Therefore, the amount of 32P-labeled RNA that hybridizes to probe 1 reflects the level of transcription across c-fos exon 1. Probe 2 is a cDNA fragment that contains exons 2, 3, and a portion of exon 4. The amount of 32P-labeled RNA that hybridizes to this probe reflects the level of transcription across these downstream exons. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the run-on assay was carried out using nuclei from unstimulated cells, the 32P-labeled transcripts hybridized to probe 1 (1AS), but not to probe 2 (2AS). This suggests that in unstimulated PC12 cells a detectable level of c-fos transcription was initiated at the promoter and transcribed through exon 1. However, no detectable transcription complexes successfully transcribed through downstream exon sequences indicating a pause site (block) in transcriptional elongation at a position 5′ to exon 2. Exposure of PC12 cells to elevated levels of KCl (final concentration, 60 mM) for 15 min resulted in a 4.1-fold increase in hybridization to probe 1 and in the appearance of hybridization to probe 2. The increased hybridization was specific to the antisense (AS) c-fos probes and occurred to only a very minor extent with the c-fos sense (S) probes. Hybridization to both the exon 1 and exon 2-4 probes decreased at later time points (3 h) to the levels seen in unstimulated cells. Taken together these results suggest that membrane depolarization leads to an induction of c-fos transcription by increasing the rate of initiation of complexes at the promoter (reflected by the increase in 32P-labeled transcripts that hybridize to exon 1), and by increasing the ability of transcription complexes to proceed through 3′ exons (reflected by an increase in KCl-treated cells in the level of 32P-labeled transcripts that hybridize to exon 2). It seems likely that the elongation block site is located within the first c-fos intron since analogous elongation pause sites have been identified in non-neuronal cells within the first introns of the murine and human c-fos genes(36Werlen G. Belin D. Conne B. Roche E. Lew D.P. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16596-16601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Collart M.A. Tourkine N. Belin D. Vassalli P. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2826-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. Toukine N. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.-M. Cell. 1990; 61: 485-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We next asked if the −60 c-fos CaRE/CRE mediates transcription in KCl-treated cells by stimulating an increase in the initiation of transcription or by relieving the block to elongation. To test whether the CaRE/CRE might mediate the initiation of transcription, the depolarization induction of a heterologous gene construct which consists of the c-fos promoter fused to a reporter gene was assayed. This reporter gene consists of 71 nucleotides of the mouse c-fos promoter, including the CaRE/CRE, the TATA box, and the c-fos initiation site, fused to a CAT gene (71wtfosCAT) (25Berkowitz L.A. Riabowol K.T. Gilman M.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This construct lacks the previously characterized c-fos elongation pause site. PC12 cells were transfected with 71wtfosCAT and then depolarized by exposure to elevated levels of extracellular KCl. Cytoplasmic mRNA was analyzed by RNase protection. Fig. 2B shows that depolarization leads to an increase in correctly initiated fosCAT reporter transcripts within 30 min. When a similar construct (71pm3fosCAT) containing a mutation within the CaRE/CRE was tested, the level of fosCAT transcripts was barely detectable, indicating the necessity for an intact CaRE/CRE for membrane depolarization induction of reporter gene expression. Because the 71wtfosCAT construct contains the c-fos promoter and initiation site but not the c-fos elongation pause site, these results suggest that the presence of an intact CaRE/CRE stimulates an increase in the formation of initiation complexes in membrane depolarized cells and indicate that the c-fos elongation pause sequences are not required for transcriptional activation by membrane depolarization. While VSCC activation induces c-fos transcription by regulating the CaRE-dependent initiation of transcription at the promoter, depolarization-induced changes in transcription elongation also occur. The control of elongation could be due to a second Ca2+-mediated regulatory event that occurs at the elongation pause site. Alternatively, the control of elongation may be linked to events that occur at the promoter. To begin to distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the effects of membrane depolarization on the expression of a c-fos gene whose transcriptional initiation was not controlled by a Ca2+-responsive element, but rather by the constitutive viral transcriptional activator, herpes simplex virus VP16(39Triezenberg S.J. LaMarco K.L. McKnight S.L. Genes& Dev. 1988; 2: 730-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because VP16 is a constitutive activator, depolarization would not be expected to affect transcriptional initiation, and any changes in expression should be due soley to effects on elongation through c-fos sequences. To place c-fos expression under the control of VP16, the yeast GAL4 fusion and reporter system was employed(40Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The VP16 transcriptional activation domain was directed to the human c-fos reporter (GAL4-fos) promoter by fusing it to the DNA binding portion of the yeast GAL4 protein. The GAL4 portion of this fusion protein, GAL4VP16, mediates binding to GAL4-binding sites that were inserted at position −42 in the human c-fos reporter (GAL4-fos or G9, Fig. 1B). Expression of the GAL4-fos reporter in the presence of the GAL4VP16 activator was compared to expression in the presence of GAL4CREB, which is known to be regulated by Ca2+. The c-fos elongation pause sequences that are present within the GAL4-fos gene would be likely to function as a pause site when this gene is transiently transfected into PC12 cells, since these elongation pause sequences have been shown previously to function in an in vitro transcription system(41Mechti N. Piechaczyk M. Blanchard J.-M. Jeanteur P. LeBleu B. Mol. Cell.

EGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), bombesin, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activated PLD as measured by transphosphatidylation of butanol to phosphatidylbutanol. The increase in inositol phosphates induced by bFGF, EGF, or bombesin was significantly enhanced by Ro-31-8220, an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), suggesting that PtdIns(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing phospholipase is coupled to the receptors for these agonists but that the response is down-regulated by PKC. Activation of PLD by EGF was inhibited dose dependently by the PKC inhibitors bis-indolylmaleimide and Ro-31-8220, which also inhibited the effects of bFGF, bombesin, and PDGF. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged treatment with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also abolished EGF- and PDGF-stimulated phosphatidylbutanol formation. EGF and bombesin induced biphasic translocations of PKCδ and ε to the membrane that were detectable at 15 s. In the presence of Ro-31-8220, translocation of PKCα became evident, and membrane association of the δ- and ε-isozymes was enhanced and/or sustained in response to the two agonists. The inhibitor also enhanced EGF-stimulated [3H]diacylglycerol formation in cells preincubated with [3H]arachidonic acid, which labeled predominantly phosphatidylinositol, but inhibited [3H]diacyl-glycerol production in cells preincubated with [3H]myristic acid, which labeled mainly phosphatidylcholine. These data support the conclusion that EGF can stimulate diacylglycerol formation from PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that PKC performs the dual role of down-regulating this response as well as mediating phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis.

Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much evidence has been gathered on the EGF receptor signaling system using the A431 cells. PI-PLC-γ1 is one of the proteins that is activated by EGF through interaction of the enzyme with autophosphorylation sites on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (2Koch A.C. Anderson D.A. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 3Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Suh P.-G. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The activated PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which elevates cytosolic Ca2+ and activates protein kinase C (PKC), respectively.Recent evidence shows that many agonists, including EGF, also stimulate DAG production through the hydrolysis of PtdCho and that phospholipase D (PLD) is the major enzyme involved(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD initially produces PtdOH, which may have second messenger roles, but can also be rapidly converted by PtdOH phosphohydrolase to DAG(6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Most agonists induce a biphasic production of DAG, with PI-PLC being responsible for the initial rapid increase and PtdCho-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PC-PLD) for the second sustained increase.Although agonist-induced activation of PLD is a widely occurring phenomenon, the regulatory mechanisms involved are not well defined. Evidence for the involvement of PKC in the regulation of PLD has been obtained in many different cell systems with various agonists. Addition of the phorbol ester, PMA, increases PLD activity in many cells, and treatment of cells with PKC inhibitors or down-regulation of the enzyme abolishes PLD activation by PMA and most agonists(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1993; 268: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also enhances the PLD response. Similarly, when cells are depleted of PKC by antisense methods, PLD activation is inhibited(11Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C. Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Based on the evidence that PKC plays a major role in the regulation of PLD, it has been proposed that DAG produced by initial PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown activates PKCs, which then directly or indirectly activate PLD(12Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Cook S.F. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochim. Biophys.

However, evidence for this sequential mechanism is limited, and there have been several reports presenting contrary findings. For example, certain agonists in some cell types do not induce detectable increases in InsPs, while they elicit a sustained DAG increase originating from PtdCho(17Rosoff P.M. Savage N. Dinarello C.A. Cell. 1988; 54: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 18Wright T.M. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. Biochem.

Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There have also been contradictory results concerning the effect of EGF on PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism. This growth factor induces PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in hepatocytes and A431 cells (22Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but produces no detectable increase in InsPs in fibroblast cell lines, although it stimulates mitogenesis(18Wright T.M.

Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apparent activation of PLD in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis suggests the existence of a PKC-independent pathway (19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).In the present report, we have studied the mechanisms of activation of PC-PLD by EGF in Swiss 3T3 cells. In contrast to the report of Cook and Wakelam(19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we observed a small but reproducible increase in InsP formation in EGF-stimulated cells, which was enhanced by a PKC inhibitor. In addition, we provide evidence for the involvement of PKC in the activation of PLD by EGF.DISCUSSIONIt is becoming clear that PtdCho hydrolysis by PLD is a widespread cellular response to many agonists(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 7Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Through this pathway, many known or potential signaling molecules such as PtdOH, lysoPtdOH, DAG, monoacylglycerol, and arachidonic acid and its metabolites can be produced. Most G-protein-coupled and receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled agonists have been shown to stimulate PtdCho hydrolysis by PLD by a process that appears to be downstream of the initial Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG formation by PI-PLC and to involve PKC activation(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 12Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 14Cook S.J. Palmer S. Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

J. 1991; 279: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).In A431 cells, EGF has been shown to stimulate the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 via the activation of PLCγ due to the tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor(3Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Suh P.-G. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1568-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although Cook and Wakelam (19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have suggested that EGF does not induce the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, the present report provides evidence indicating that PI-PLC is also coupled to the EGF receptor in these cells. We consistently observed a small but reproducible increase in InsPs in EGF-stimulated cells, and this was enhanced by the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 3). The enhancing effect of the inhibitor is probably due to its prevention of down-modulation of the EGF receptor by PKC. Evidence for such down-regulation has been provided by Wahl and Carpenter (42Wahl M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7581-7590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is in accordance with the findings of Davis (30Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9462-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others(22Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Johnson R.M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17285-17293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of Cook and Wakelam (19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) to observe an increase in InsPs with EGF in Swiss 3T3 cells may relate to their use of cells that had grown to confluency for 48 h. We have observed that such cells show diminished responses to EGF.In additional support of the involvement of PI-PLC in the activation of PC-PLD in Swiss 3T3 cells is the observation that the relative efficacy of EGF, PDGF, and bombesin in stimulating PtdBut formation (Fig. 1) is the same as for activating PI-PLC (Fig. 2). Similar observations have been made in hepatocytes stimulated by various agonists(43Moehren G. Gustavsson L. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 838-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Because of our evidence that EGF is coupled to the PI-PLC signaling system in Swiss 3T3 cells, we expected that the activation of PLD by EGF would be PKC dependent. In contrast to the report of Cook and Wakelam(19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), three potent, selective PKC inhibitors (bIM, Ro-31-8220, and chelerythrine) dose-dependently antagonized EGF-induced PtdBut formation (Fig. 4). The potency of the inhibitors on PLD activation by EGF was similar to that for inhibition of other PKC-mediated cellular responses(32Toullec D. Pianett P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Davis P.D. Hill C.H. Keech E. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Sedgwick A.D. Wadsworth J. Westmacott D. Wilkinson S.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 34Herbert J.M. Augereau J.M. Gleye J. Maffrand J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 993-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). The concentrations required to inhibit PLD were much higher than those required to inhibit PKC isozymes in vitro (Fig. 5), reflecting limitations and differences in the permeability of intact cells to the inhibitors. To our knowledge, Fig. 5 presents the first data on the effects of bIM and Ro-31-8220 on individual PKC isozymes.Fig. 8 illustrates that 10 μM Ro-31-8220 was unable to completely abolish the stimulation of PLD by four different agonists. Although this could merely be due to an inability to achieve full inhibition of PKC isozymes at this non-toxic dose, it is also possible that PKC-independent mechanisms of PLD activation could exist. However, the fact that down-regulation of PKC eliminated the ability of EGF or PDGF to stimulate PLD (Fig. 7) argues against this possibility. In these experiments, PKC depletion produced a substantial increase in basal PLD activity. The basis for this is unknown, but it could imply a role for PKC in the regulation of the synthesis or degradation of the enzyme. The basal level of PLD activity observed in Figure 7:, Figure 8: is probably due to the existence of multiple PLD isozymes, as has been speculated(44Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Aramburu J. Mollinedo F. Lopez-Botet M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 45Agwu D.E. McCall C.E. McPhail L.C. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3895-3903PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ben-Av P. Eli Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16859-16865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such PKC-independent isozymes could be regulated by other mechanisms, e.g. those involving small G-proteins such as ARF and Rho(48Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar).In our studies of the regulation of PLD by PKC, we did not employ the PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and sphingosine, since these have been shown to stimulate PLD (51Lavie Y. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3868-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Kanaho Y. Takahashi K. Tomita U. Iiri T. Katada T. Ui M. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23554-23559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) via the activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins or other mechanisms. This probably accounts for the fact that these inhibitors usually do not produce complete inhibition of the activation of PLD(6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). 5Since Song et al.(40Song J. Jiang Y.-W. Foster D.A. Cell Growth and Differentiation. 1994; 5: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that staurosporine does not inhibit EGF-stimulated PLD activity in A431 cells, we tested the effects of Ro-31-8220 in this system. In accord with our findings in Swiss 3T3 cells, Ro-31-8220 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the EGF effect in A431 cells. Down-regulation of PKC also abolished the EGF effect in these cells. Another issue is that PKC is often involved not only in the stimulation of PLD by an agonist but also in the down-regulation of its receptor (22Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Johnson R.M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17285-17293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Wahl M.

Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, in the presence of a PKC inhibitor, downregulation of the receptor could be blocked, resulting in enhancement of the signal for PtdBut accumulation. As a result of these positive and negative effects, PKC inhibitors could thus have variable effects on PLD activity.In any consideration of the role of PKC in the regulation of PLD, another point should be recognized. This is that the DAG derived from PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown may be considered to act as a “trigger” for PLD activation via PKC, i.e. continuing production of DAG from this source may not be required. This is because, once activated, PLD can produce DAG from PtdCho via PtdOH phosphohydrolase, and this DAG can then sustain PKC activation and hence PLD activity. This would explain why PLD activation can continue despite down-regulation of the PI-PLC response.The conclusion that the EGF receptor, like the receptor for bombesin, is linked to PI-PLC in Swiss 3T3 cells is further supported by the PKC translocation studies of Figure 10:, Figure 11:. These show a movement of PKCα to the membrane in EGF-stimulated cells in the presence of Ro-31-8220. Because we have shown that the inhibitor increases InsPs production (Fig. 3) and [3H]DAG production in response to EGF in [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled cells (Fig. 9B), it is likely that the translocation reflects DAG formation from PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane. In IIC9 fibroblasts, it has been shown that PKCα translocation requires concurrent rises in DAG and Ca2+, i.e. PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis(20Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).There have been some efforts to define the role of the various PKC isoforms in the regulation of PLD. In membranes prepared from CCL39 fibroblasts, only PKCα and -β were activators of PLD(58Conricode K.M. Smith J.L. Burns D.J. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but whole cells were not examined. In other studies, PKCα and -ε were implicated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (11Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C. Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in messangial cells(59Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler U. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PKCβ1 overexpression in rat fibroblasts has been observed to enhance agonist-stimulated PLD activity(8Pai J.-K. Dobek E.A. Bishop W.R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Pachter J.A. Pai J.-K. Mayer-Ezell R. Petrin J.M. Dobek E. Bishop W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9826-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of PKCα enhances it in Swiss 3T3 cells(10Eldar H. Ben-Av P. Schmidt U.-S. Livneh E. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, transfection of PKCα constructs into Cos-1 cells resulted in partial suppression of the PLD response to PMA(60McKinnon M. Parker P. Biochim. Biophys, Acta. 1994; 1222: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Except for the latter observation, these findings implicate PKC-α, -β, and -ε in the stimulation of PLD. Since PKCε is Ca2+-independent, it may be the isozyme principally involved in the “feedback” activation of PLD that occurs when DAG is derived mainly from PtdCho after the initial phase of agonist stimulation.Although there is evidence that PLD can be activated by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism in membranes from CCL-39 cells (61Conricode K.M. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7199-7202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stimulation has been shown to require ATP-dependent phosphorylation in many cell types(62Reinhold S.L. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 63Olson S.C. Bowman E.P. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17236-17242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we observed that Ro-31-8220 blocked PLD activation but promoted membrane association of PKCs, it seems that translocation of PKC protein per se does not activate PLD, i.e. it also requires the catalytic activity of the kinase.Clearly, more work needs to be done to more rigorously define the regulation of PC-PLD by G-protein- and tyrosine kinase-linked agonists. Most important is the need to purify and characterize the PC-PLD isozymes involved and to demonstrate if they are direct substrates for PKC isozymes and if their phosphorylation is correlated with activation. 6The general conclusion of this study, namely that EGF activates PC-PLD via PI-PLC and PKC, is supported by studies with TRMP cells expressing mutant PDGF receptors. These showed that only those receptors that could couple to PI-PLCγ were able to mediate PDGF activation of PLD(64Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much evidence has been gathered on the EGF receptor signaling system using the A431 cells. PI-PLC-γ1 is one of the proteins that is activated by EGF through interaction of the enzyme with autophosphorylation sites on the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (2Koch A.C. Anderson D.A. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 3Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Suh P.-G. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The activated PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 to generate Ins(1,4,5)P3 and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), which elevates cytosolic Ca2+ and activates protein kinase C (PKC), respectively.Recent evidence shows that many agonists, including EGF, also stimulate DAG production through the hydrolysis of PtdCho and that phospholipase D (PLD) is the major enzyme involved(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD initially produces PtdOH, which may have second messenger roles, but can also be rapidly converted by PtdOH phosphohydrolase to DAG(6Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Most agonists induce a biphasic production of DAG, with PI-PLC being responsible for the initial rapid increase and PtdCho-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PC-PLD) for the second sustained increase.Although agonist-induced activation of PLD is a widely occurring phenomenon, the regulatory mechanisms involved are not well defined. Evidence for the involvement of PKC in the regulation of PLD has been obtained in many different cell systems with various agonists. Addition of the phorbol ester, PMA, increases PLD activity in many cells, and treatment of cells with PKC inhibitors or down-regulation of the enzyme abolishes PLD activation by PMA and most agonists(5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Billah M.M. Anthes J.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).

Similarly, when cells are depleted of PKC by antisense methods, PLD activation is inhibited(11Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C. Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Based on the evidence that PKC plays a major role in the regulation of PLD, it has been proposed that DAG produced by initial PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown activates PKCs, which then directly or indirectly activate PLD(12Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Cook S.F. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochim. Biophys.

However, evidence for this sequential mechanism is limited, and there have been several reports presenting contrary findings. For example, certain agonists in some cell types do not induce detectable increases in InsPs, while they elicit a sustained DAG increase originating from PtdCho(17Rosoff P.M. Savage N. Dinarello C.A.

This growth factor induces PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in hepatocytes and A431 cells (22Pike L.J. Eakes A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1644-1651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but produces no detectable increase in InsPs in fibroblast cell lines, although it stimulates mitogenesis(18Wright T.M.

The apparent activation of PLD in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis suggests the existence of a PKC-independent pathway (19Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem.

Growth and differentiation of skeletal myoblasts in culture is regulated by polypeptide growth factors. The responses of skeletal myoblasts to two of these factors, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 1The abbreviations used are: bFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorTGFβtransforming growth factor βbHLHbasic helix-loop-helixcdkcyclin-dependent kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salinesMHCsarcomeric myosin heavy chain. (Lathrop et al., 1985; Spizz et al., 1986; Clegg et al., 1987) and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) (Olson et al., 1986, Massague et al., 1986) have been well characterized. Both bFGF and TGFβ inhibit myoblast differentiation, and some studies have suggested that this activity is not directly linked to their actions as mitogens (Spizz et al., 1986; Clegg et al., 1987). A central issue in understanding the mechanism by which specific growth factors inhibit myoblast differentiation involves their specific effects on the activity of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) regulators (reviewed by Weintraub et al.(1991) and Olson (1992)). The myogenic (bHLH) regulators, also referred to as the myoD family, are muscle-specific transcriptional activators that were originally identified by their ability, when expressed ectopically, to transdetermine fibroblasts to the myogenic phenotype (Davis et al., 1987). Four myoD family members have been identified (myoD, myogenin, myf-5, and MRF4/myf-6/herculin; Davis et al. (1987), Wright et al.(1989), Braun et al. (1989), Rhodes and Konieczny(1989), Braun et al.(1990), and Miner and Wold(1990)), and these share a common structural motif, the bHLH, that mediates dimer assembly and site-specific binding to DNA. Post-translation mechanisms that control myogenic bHLH regulator activity operate either by abolishing the DNA binding activity of these regulators or by impeding their ability to activate transcription of muscle genes at stages downstream from DNA binding. The former mechanism functions in myoblasts responding to bFGF, which abrogates of the DNA binding activity of myogenic bHLH regulators by inducing phosphorylation of the basic region by protein kinase C (Li et al., 1992). In contrast, myogenic bHLH regulators in myoblasts blocked from differentiation by TGFβ appear to retain DNA binding activity, but do not activate transcription of muscle genes (Brennan et al., 1991). The mechanisms that control myogenic bHLH regulator activity without affecting their ability to bind DNA, however, are not well understood. basic fibroblast growth factor transforming growth factor β basic helix-loop-helix cyclin-dependent kinase phosphate-buffered saline sarcomeric myosin heavy chain. Myoblast differentiation is restricted to a specific window in the G1 phase of the cell cycle; after mitogen withdrawal, myoblasts outside of this window will either not differentiate, or continue to cycle until reaching this window, and then differentiate (reviewed in Olson(1992)). Specific parameters of cell cycle progression are apparently linked to the regulation of myogenic differentiation. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb; reviewed by Weinberg (1991), Marshall(1991), and Goodrich et al.(1991)) physically associates with the HLH subdomain of myoD family members, and the significance of this interaction is 2-fold. 1) Expression of myogenic bHLH regulators in some cells results in G1 arrest, which may be mediated by binding of these regulators to pRb (Crescenzi et al., 1990; Sorrentino et al., 1990); and 2) myogenic bHLH regulators do not activate muscle gene transcription in SAOS-2 cells, which express only defective pRb (Gu et al., 1993), suggesting that association with pRb may be important to the function of myoD family members as transcriptional activators. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) has also been associated with repression of muscle gene transcription. C2C12 myoblasts expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 T-antigen differentiate at the non-permissive temperature (T-antigen is inactive), but differentiated myotubes lose the muscle phenotype and re-enter the cell cycle when cultured at the permissive temperature. One of the initial events associated with loss of the myogenic phenotype in these cells is activation of cdk activity (Gu et al., 1993). Phosphorylation of histone H1 on at least one cdk site is abolished in differentiated myotubes (Cole et al., 1993). 2G. Shue and D. Kohtz, unpublished results. This was demonstrated in situ using a monoclonal antibody that reacts with an epitope on histone H1 only when it is phosphorylated by a cdk. Loss of histone H1 phosphorylation at this epitope was shown to be directly associated with the differentiation of myocytes rather than the acquisition of a quiescent state by undifferentiated mononuclear cells (Cole et al., 1993). Cyclins are the regulatory subunits of the cdks, and their expression is modulated according to type during cell cycle progression. The activities of various cyclin-cdk complexes regulate progress through and transitions between phases of the cell cycle. Cyclins A and B are expressed at peak levels during S/G2 and G2/M, respectively, and control the progress of events during S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle (Minshull et al., 1990; Pines and Hunter, 1990; Norbury and Nurse, 1992). The G1 cyclins (cyclins C, E, and D-type cyclins) are expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and control progress through that phase and the transition to S phase (Baldin et al., 1993; reviewed by Sherr(1993)). D-type cyclins are unique among reported cyclins in that their expression in some cell types is modulated by growth factor signals (Xiong et al., 1991; Matsushime et al., 1991a, 1991b; Inaba et al., 1992). Expression of D-type cyclins is thought to translate mitogenic signals transduced from growth factors into the language of regulators that control cell cycle progression. The presence of certain D-type cyclins may promote cell cycle progression in specific cell types, and their absence may signal an exit from the cell cycle (Cocks et al., 1992). In some cell types, such as myoblasts and myeloid cells, inducing differentiation and exiting the cell cycle are closely coupled. Indeed, ectopic expression of cyclin D2 and D3 inhibits differentiation of 32D myeloid cells into granulocytes (Kato and Sherr, 1993), while ectopic expression of cyclin D1 inhibits activation of muscle-specific gene transcription by myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulators (Rao et al., 1994). In order to better understand the role of D-type cyclin expression in the regulation of differentiation by growth factors, we have studied the expression of cyclins D1 and D3 in differentiating myoblasts and in myoblasts blocked from differentiation by bFGF and TGFβ. In addition, we show that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 at levels equivalent to those expressed in cells stimulated by bFGF inhibits differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 myoblasts (Blau et al., 1983) were routinely passaged in high mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 0.5% chick embryo extract (Life Technologies, Inc.), minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), minimal essential medium vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin). To induce differentiation, myoblasts were cultured in low mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2-4% horse serum, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), minimal essential medium vitamins (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin). Subclone 10 of C2C12 cells (C2C12-10) was generated by plating C2C12 cells (acquired from ATCC) at clonal density for 14 days, removing colonies with cloning cylinders, and testing each clone for inhibition of differentiation by bFGF or TGFβ. TGFβ (R& Systems) was used at a concentration of 5 ng/ml. bFGF (Collaborative Biomedical Research) was used at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured cells by guanidinium/isothiocyanate denaturation and cesium chloride density centrifugation as described previously (Chirgwin et al., 1979). Messenger RNA was enriched by oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography and resolved by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). The mRNA was transferred and cross-linked to GeneScreen Plus (DuPont NEN) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Blots were baked under vacuum at 80°C for 2 h to reverse the formaldehyde reaction. Prehybridization and hybridization mixes contained 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0), 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, 1 mg/ml sonicated denatured salmon sperm DNA, 100 μg/ml poly(A), 100 μg/ml yeast transfer RNA). Prehybridization was performed for 6 h at 51°C, followed by an 18-h hybridization at 51°C with 106 dpm/ml probe. The blots were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 1% SDS (55°C, 30 min), then once with 0.2 × SSC (50°C, 30 min). Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-AR5 film and DuPont intensifying screens. Bands were quantified with either a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or Microdensitometry Scanner (LDK). The cDNA clones for cyclin D1 (Motokura et al., 1991) and cyclin D3 (Lew et al., 1991; Hinds et al., 1992) were obtained in pRc-CMV (Invitrogen) from Dr. Phil Hinds (Whitehead Institute), Dr. Robert Weinberg (Whitehead Institute), and Dr. Andrew Arnold (Harvard Medical School). The cDNA fragments were excised by HindIII and XbaI digestions, and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid cM113aR containing the mouse fast troponin I gene (Koppe et al., 1989) was obtained from Dr. Steve Koznieczny (Purdue University). A plasmid containing the cDNA for rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Piechaczyk et al., 1984) was obtained from Dr. Jim Bieker (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Radiolabeled probes were generated by the random hexamer priming method using a kit (New England Biolabs). Myoblast cultures grown on T25 flasks were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then lysed directly on the plates with sample buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 6.5, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.025% phenol red). Lysates were heated to 100°C prior to gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to a standard protocol, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and blotted as described in detail elsewhere (Cole et al., 1993). A rabbit polyclonal cyclin D1 antibody and mouse monoclonal cyclin D3 antibody were obtained from Pharmingen. Hybridoma cells secreting mouse monoclonal sMHC antibody MF-20 (Bader et al., 1982) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. 125I-Coupled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from DuPont NEN. Myoblasts to be used for immunofluorescence analysis were grown on 30-mm culture plates. The cells were washed 3 × with PBS (ambient temperature), then fixed with 100% methanol (−20°C, 10 min). The cells were rehydrated in PBS (ambient temperature), then incubated with PBS containing 5% horse serum for 30 min (37°C). Primary antibody was used at a concentration of 1:30 in PBS containing 5% horse serum, and was incubated on the cells in a humidified chamber for 1 h (37°C). After 3 washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG/IgM antibody (Boehringer/Mannheim) for 1 h (37°C). The cells were washed 3 times with PBS, then and bound antibody was visualized with a Nikon Diaphot inverted phase fluorescence microscopy. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. A 50% confluent T75 flask of C2C12 myoblasts was co-transfected with 3 μg of pSV2Neo (Southern and Berg, 1982) and 10 μg of pEMSV-cyclin D1 (or pEMSVscribeα2, the vector control). The cells were cultured with the precipitates for 18 h, then passed to two 15-cm culture dishes (per T75 flask). The cells were cultured in high mitogen medium in the presence of 500 μg/ml (effective concentration) G418 for 2-3 weeks, with the media being changed every 3 days. When the colonies reached macroscopic size, they were cultured for 48-72 h in low mitogen medium. The plates were then washed three times with PBS (ambient temperature), and fixed for 10 min in 70% ethanol, 10% formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid (−20°C). The colonies were rehydrated and washed several times with PBS, then incubated for 2 h with 5 μg/ml monoclonal antibody MF-20 (Bader et al., 1982) in PBS supplemented with 5% horse serum (37°C). The plates were then washed twice with PBS, and incubated 1 h (37°C) with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Boehringer/Mannheim; 1:500). After three washes with PBS, the reactions were developed with 1 mg/ml diaminobenzidine and 0.15% H2O2 in PBS. After being scored and photographed, the plates were stained with 0.25% Crystal Violet to score total G418-resistant colonies. A subclone of C2C12 myoblasts (Blau et al., 1983) was selected that was inhibited from differentiation by bFGF (20 ng/ml) or TGFβ (5 ng/ml) with high sensitivity (C2C12-10; referred to within as C2C12). These cells were plated at 20-25% confluence in high mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% chick embryo extract), and allowed to grow for 48 h to 80-100% confluence. The RNA extracted from myoblasts at this stage of their growth cycle was used as a 0 point. In the course of several experiments, variations in expression of cyclins at the 0-16-h points were observed that were associated with differences in the starting conditions; for example, subconfluent myoblasts or myoblasts cultured in high mitogen medium for less than 48 h displayed relatively extended expression of cyclin D1, continuing at high levels 4-8 h after switching the cells to low mitogen medium (data not shown). The selected starting conditions represent myoblasts arriving at confluence in a medium that they have partly depleted of mitogens, a state similar to early growth arrest in fibroblasts. These cultures were switched to either low mitogen medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4% horse serum), low mitogen medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml bFGF, or low mitogen medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml TGFβ. At specific times post-induction, mRNA was extracted from the cultures and analyzed by Northern blot. Parallel expression of two cyclin D1 mRNA species (4.5 and 3.8 kilobase pairs) was observed in skeletal myoblasts. Expression of cyclin D1 dropped off from 0 point levels after switching the cultures to low mitogen medium (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Supplementing the low mitogen medium with bFGF resulted in induction of cyclin D1 expression after 4 h, with high level expression desisting 32 h post-induction (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). In the experiment shown (Fig. 1), expression of cyclin D1 mRNA returned after 64 h; however, in other experiments, cyclin D1 expression was not observed at times longer than 32 h in low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF. Supplementing low mitogen medium with TGFβ (5 ng/ml) resulted in a relatively delayed induction of cyclin D1 expression, with high level expression beginning 16 h post-induction. Cyclin D1 expression persisted for 32 and 64 h in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ (Figure 1:, Figure 2:).Figure 2:Quantitative summary of cyclin, cdk, and troponin I gene expression in myogenic cultures. The results shown in Fig. 1 were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis, and cyclin D1 and D3 mRNA levels were normalized to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals for their lanes. Northern blot analyses were also performed in other similar experiments for cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk 4; Matsushime et al., 1992) and troponin If (Koppe et al., 1989), then quantified by microdensitometry scan and presented as values standardized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western blot analyses for cyclin D1 protein were performed on whole cell lysates from myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium, low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF, and low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ. Expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (sMHC) is used as a marker of differentiation, and in its absence cells cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with either bFGF or TGFβ indicated that the myoblasts were blocked from differentiation. Changes in cyclin D1 protein levels directly reflected the observed changes in mRNA levels (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Accumulation of cyclin D1 protein peaked 4-8 h after the cells were introduced to low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF, whereas accumulation of cyclin D1 protein in response to TGFβ was observed after a 16-32-h delay.Figure 4:Quantitative summary of cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and sMHC protein expression in myogenic cultures. The results shown in Fig. 3 were quantified by microdensitometry scan.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of the cyclin D3 gene was detected by Northern blot of mRNA isolated from skeletal myoblasts cultured in high mitogen medium. When myoblasts were cultured in low mitogen medium or low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ for 2-4 h, expression of the cyclin D3 gene was reduced significantly, but after 8 h returned to levels equivalent to those observed in the 0-point myoblasts (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). After 32 h in low mitogen medium, expression of the cyclin D3 gene increased significantly, persisting at a level greater than that of the 0 point through 64 h post-induction. In contrast, after 64 h in low mitogen supplemented with TGFβ, accumulation of cyclin D3 mRNA had increased minimally in comparison to the level observed in 0 point myoblasts (Fig. 2). Myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF did not display a reduction in cyclin D3 mRNA levels between 2 and 8 h post-induction. By 64 h post-induction, the level of cyclin D3 mRNA was lower than that observed in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium alone, but greater than that in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ. Although bFGF was less effective in preventing accumulation of cyclin D3 mRNA than TGFβ, both factors prevented accumulation of sarcomeric transcripts (such as troponin I; Fig. 2) equivalently. To summarize, the cyclin D3 gene in myoblasts responded in a biphasic manner to mitogen withdrawal and induction of differentiation: 2-4 h post-induction, cyclin D3 mRNA quantitatively decreased from 0 point levels; 32-64 h post-induction, cyclin D3 mRNA accumulated to levels greater than those observed in 0 point myoblasts. Supplementing the low mitogen medium with bFGF inhibited the reduction at 2 and 4 h post-induction, and partially inhibited the later increase in cyclin D3 mRNA levels; supplementing the low mitogen with TGFβ inhibited only the increase in cyclin D3 mRNA at 32 and 64 h post-induction. Western blot analyses for cyclin D3 protein accumulation were performed on whole cell lysates from myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium, low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF, and low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). Low levels of cyclin D3 protein were detected at most time points. A significant increase in cyclin D3 protein accumulation was observed in myoblasts induced to differentiate in low mitogen medium for 64 h. Inhibiting myoblast differentiation by supplementing the low mitogen medium with either bFGF or TGFβ prevented this increase in cyclin D3 protein accumulation. Cyclin D3 protein levels changed more significantly during myoblast differentiation than did mRNA levels, suggesting that translational or post-translational regulatory mechanisms are important in controlling cyclin D3 expression in muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 myoblast cultures consist of multinucleated syncytia that express sarcomeric proteins and quiescent mononuclear cells that do not display a muscle phenotype. Immunofluorescence microscopy with a cyclin D3 antibody was used to determine which cell population expresses cyclin D3. A punctate nuclear distribution of cyclin D3 was observed in terminally differentiated myotubes (Fig. 5). Individual nuclei within each myotube would often display different intensities of cyclin D3 immunofluorescence, and cyclin D3 was also detected in some quiescent mononuclear cells (albeit at lesser intensity). C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with pEMSV-cyclin D1 (or pEMSVscribeα2 vector control) and pSV2Neo. G418-resistant colonies were selected, cultured in low mitogen medium, and differentiated colonies were scored after immunostaining for sMHC with monoclonal antibody MF-20 (Bader et al., 1982). Subsequently, G418-resist-ant colonies were scored by Crystal Violet stain. The results of three independent experiments are compiled in Table 1. In experiments 1 and 2, only colonies larger than 3 mm in diameter were scored. In these experiments, transfection of pEMSV-cyclin D1 increased the percentage of differentiation-defective clones 3.2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, over transfection of the expression vector (pEMSVscribeα2). In experiment 3, all colonies were scored, and since the smaller colonies differentiate poorly, a greater frequency of spontaneous differentiation-defective colonies was scored. In experiment 3, transfection of pEMSV-cyclin D1 increased the percentage of differentiation-defective colonies 2.1-fold. The results of experiment 3 are also shown in Fig. 6. In this experiment, the differentiation-defective clones in the pEMSVscribeα2 transfection are mostly <3 mm in diameter, and similar colonies comprise about half of the differentiation-defective colonies in the pEMSV-cyclin D1 transfection. The frequency of large (>3 mm diameter) differentiation-defective colonies was significantly greater in pEMSV-cyclin D1 than in pEMSVscribeα2 transfected cells (Fig. 6).Table I Open table in a new tab In separate experiments, Northern blot analysis of recovered colonies indicated that >90% of the G418-resistant colonies expressed the integrated pEMSV-cyclin D1 construct(s). The level of ectopic cyclin D1 gene expression varied among the clones. A series of clones expressing differing levels of cyclin D1 transcripts was selected for further analysis (Fig. 7). Western blot analysis indicated that differences in cyclin D1 mRNA levels manifested as differences in levels of cyclin D1 protein. Western blot analysis of sMHC protein levels in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium for 48 h indicated that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 affected differentiation in a biphasic manner: at expression levels equivalent to or below those observed in myoblasts stimulated by bFGF, ectopic cyclin D1 inhibited differentiation; at expression levels profoundly exceeding those in myoblasts stimulated by bFGF, cyclin D1 had no effect on myoblast differentiation (as determined by sMHC expression; Fig. 7). Visual inspection of the clones indicated that inhibition of myoblast fusion and myotube assembly paralleled changes in sMHC expression (not shown). These results indicate that appropriate physiological levels of cyclin D1, such as those produced after stimulation by bFGF (or even lower levels), inhibit myoblast differentiation. Substantially higher levels do not inhibit differentiation, possibly because the proper assembly of a trimolecular complex consisting of cyclin D1 and two associated molecules (e.g. cdk 4 and a directed substrate) is unfavorable. The appearance of increased quantities of multinucleated syncytia in high mitogen medium cultures suggested that myoblast clones expressing the highest level of ectopic cyclin D1 also had an enhanced frequency of spontaneous differentiation. Consequently, the responses of two of these clones (clones 9 and 11; Fig. 7) to bFGF and TGFβ were tested. As determined from the expression of sMHC, clone 11 (and to a lesser extent clone 9) partially differentiated in the presence of bFGF (Fig. 8), suggesting that ectopic expression of excess cyclin D1 interfered with inhibition of myoblast differentiation by bFGF. This observation is consistent with the notion suggested above that expression of excess cyclin D1 interferes with its assembly into a multimeric complex that functions in inhibition of myoblast differentiation. As a result, the effects of endogenous cyclin D1 expression induced by bFGF are abrogated in the cellular context of a myoblast expressing excess ectopic cyclin D1. The ability of myoblast clones expressing excess cyclin D1 to partially differentiate in the presence of bFGF suggests that the induction of cyclin D1 expression by bFGF is a significant functional parameter in the inhibition of myoblast differentiation. Expression of the cyclin D1 gene in myoblasts is abolished when the cells are induced to differentiate in low mitogen medium. Supplementing low mitogen medium with either bFGF or TGFβ inhibits differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, and induced expression pattern of the cyclin D1 gene. Confluent myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF displayed a significant increase in cyclin D1 gene expression 4-8 h post-induction. At 16 h, cyclin D1 mRNA levels in these cultures fell significantly, and by 32 h they returned to initial levels. The pattern of induction of the cyclin D1 gene in myoblasts by bFGF is characteristic of the induction of early response genes, such as c-myc (Greenberg and Ziff, 1984), to certain growth factors. In comparison to induction by bFGF, induction of the cyclin D1 gene in myoblasts by TGFβ was significantly delayed. Initial accumulation of cyclin D1 mRNA was observed after 16 h in low mitogen medium supplemented with TGFβ, increasing to higher levels at 32 and 64 h. The difference between the pattern of cyclin D1 expression induced by bFGF and TGFβ strongly suggests that the signaling pathways activated by these two factors in myoblasts diverge significantly. Another possible explanation for the delayed response of the cyclin D1 gene to TGFβ is that the effect is actually mediated by a second factor secreted in response to TGFβ by the myoblasts. Further experiments are warranted to explore this hypothesis. Previously, we observed that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 prevents activation of muscle gene transcription by myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulators in transient expression assays (Rao et al., 1994). As shown in this report, however, only a fraction of myoblast clones stably transfected with pEMSV-cyclin D1 are inhibited from differentiation. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that expression of ectopic cyclin D1 was observed in most clones. Individual clones expressed different amounts of cyclin D1 mRNA from the transfected construct, and in general cyclin D1 protein accumulated to quantities corresponding to the relative level of mRNA. Presumably, variations in cyclin D1 expression among individual clones are directly associated with differences in the copy number of transfected expression constructs. Myoblast differentiation, as determined morphologically by the assembly of myotubes and biochemically by expression of sMHC, was inhibited in clones expressing cyclin D1 at levels similar to those observed in cultures stimulated by bFGF. Clones expressing cyclin D1 at significantly higher levels were not inhibited by differentiation. This observation is consistent with a mechanism of inhibition requiring the assembly of a trimolecular complex consisting of cyclin D1 bound to two other components, such as cdk4 and a directed substrate. Inhibition of myoblast differentiation only at appropriate levels of expression (and not higher levels) has important implications for the interpretation of other experiments involving ectopic expression of cyclin D1. In particular, it is possible that certain functions of cyclin D1 may be masked by overexpression of the ectopic expression construct. Some myoblast clones expressing excess ectopic cyclin D1 acquired the ability to partly differentiate in the presence of bFGF. This observation suggests that cyclin D1 induced to physiological levels in normal myoblasts by bFGF may function in the inhibition of differentiation by this growth factor. The function of cyclin D1 in the inhibition of myoblast differentiation by bFGF would most likely lie downstream of the effects of this growth factor on protein kinase C phosphorylation of the myogenic bHLH proteins (Li et al., 1992). Induction of protein kinase C activity by bFGF and subsequent phosphorylation of myogenic bHLH regulators may occur rapidly and transiently. Inhibition of myoblast differentiation by bFGF at later time points could be associated with the induction of cyclin D1 expression. We have shown previously that the activity of a myogenin basic-region mutant lacking the protein kinase C site (Li et al., 1992) is inhibited by ectopic cyclin D1 even though it is refractory to inhibition by bFGF (Rao et al., 1994). This observation supports the notion that inhibition of myogenic bHLH regulator activity by cyclin D1 operates downstream from protein kinase C phosphorylation. Experiments in progress will determine whether myogenic bHLH proteins suppress cyclin D1 gene expression, and the possible role of protein kinase C phosphorylation may play to counter this suppression and mediate the induction of cyclin D expression in myoblasts cultured with bFGF. These observations would show that the activity of myogenin basic-region mutants in the presence of bFGF is associated with two events: lack of basic region phosphorylation by protein kinase C and, as a consequence, maintained suppression of cyclin D1 expression. The cyclin D3 gene exhibited a biphasic pattern of expression in myoblasts induced to differentiate by low mitogen medium. Between 2 and 8 h post-induction, the levels of cyclin D3 mRNA was reduced in comparison to that in 0-point myoblast cultures. By 16 h post-induction, cyclin D3 mRNA levels had returned to those observed in 0 point cultures, and after 32 h (the onset of overt myogenic differentiation) were severalfold higher than starting point values. One interpretation of these observations is that the cyclin D3 gene is both induced by growth factors in myoblasts, and induced during differentiation of the myoblasts into myotubes. The initial drop in cyclin D3 levels observed in low mitogen medium (or in low mitogen supplemented with TGFβ) could be associated with loss of a positive growth factor signal; the elimination of this drop from myoblast cultures in low mitogen medium supplemented with bFGF supports this interpretation. Differentiation of myoblasts after 32 h in low mitogen medium may be a prerequisite for later induction of the cyclin D3 gene; attenuation of this induction in myoblasts cultured in low mitogen medium supplemented with either TGFβ or bFGF supports this interpretation. The fundamental point of this model is that positive regulation of the cyclin D3 in myoblasts and myotubes result from different molecular mechanisms rather than quantitative differences in the same mechanism. Analysis of the structure of the regulatory region of the cyclin D3 gene should yield further insights into the mechanism(s) controlling its expression in myogenic cells. Finally, it is surprising that a cell cycle regulator (cyclin D3) is present in terminally differentiated myotubes, and that it is present at higher levels than in proliferating myoblasts. The suggested conclusion of this observation, that cell cycle regulators may have extended functions in some cells outside of cell cycle regulation, is intriguing. In future studies, it may be possible to demonstrate that some cyclins regulate changes in cell physiology that do not bear directly on proliferation, such as hypertrophy or cell death. It is also possible that the D-type cyclins are functionally antagonistic in some cell types, such that induction of cell cycle progression by one D-type cyclin may be competitively inhibited by expression by another D-type cyclin in the same cell. In this case, expression of cyclin D3 in terminal myocytes may have the unexpected function of preventing entry into the cell cycle rather than promoting it."

We now report that incubation of WB cells with 20:4(n-6) resulted in the appearance of several tyrosine-phosphorylated cytosolic proteins. Two of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, migrating in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of approximately 43 and 45 kDa, corresponded in mobility to phosphorylated species of the 42- and 44-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms. Immunoblots of soluble fractions from unstimulated WB cells with anti-MAPK antibodies revealed the presence of the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms of MAPK. Upon incubation with 20:4(n-6), the mobility of both isoforms was retarded, consistent with their activation by phosphorylation. Chromatography of soluble fractions from these cells on Mono Q columns revealed early and late eluting peaks of myelin basic protein kinase activity, which contained the 42- and 44-kDa MAPK isoforms, respectively. Activation of MAPK was transient, peaking at 5 min, and was detectable at 5 μM 20:4(n-6). Further studies into the mechanisms by which MAPK was activated by 20:4(n-6) strongly suggested the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC). Not only did incubation of WB cells with 20:4(n-6) result in the translocation of PKC α, δ, and ε to a particulate fraction, it was found that the fatty acid failed to activate MAPK in cells pretreated for 26 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which depleted WB cells of PKC α, δ, and ε. In addition, fatty acids of the n-3 series were effective activators of MAPK.

In addition, fatty acids of the n-3 series were effective activators of MAPK. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to report that polyunsaturated fatty acids can cause the activation of MAPK."

Two of these genes encode proteins of 451 and 488 amino acids, which, based on deduced amino acid sequence identity and homology of exhibited pharmacological profiles, appear to be species homologs of mammalian and vertebrate D1/D1A and D5/D1B receptors, respectively. The third genomic clone, termed D1D, encodes a protein of 445 amino acids displaying a deduced amino acid sequence identity within putative trans-membrane domains of 75% to mammalian D1/D1A and 77% to D5/D1B receptors with overall sequence homologies of only 49% and 46%, respectively. Membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with D1D DNA bound [3H]SCH-23390 in a saturable manner with high affinity (~300 pM) and with a pharmacological profile clearly indicative of a dopamine D1-like receptor.

In contrast, the D1D receptor bound dopaminergic agents, such as SKF-38393, apomorphine, pergolide, and lisuride, with affinities 10-fold higher than other cloned mammalian or vertebrate D1A/D1B receptor subtypes, while both clozapine and haloperidol displayed considerably lower affinity for the D1D receptor. Based on the low overall amino acid sequence identity (54%) and unique pharmacological profile, the avian dopamine D1D receptor does not appear to be a species homolog of the recently cloned vertebrate D1C receptor (Sugamori, K.

As with all cloned mammalian and vertebrate D1-like receptors, the D1D receptor stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of dopamine or SKF-82526. Northern blot analysis reveals the selective expression of both avian D1D and D1A receptor mRNAs only in brain with the D1B receptor more widely distributed and localized in tissues such as brain, kidney, and spleen.

https://openalex.org/W1993446288,"Melanosomes, the subcellular site of melanin synthesis and deposition, may be related to the endolysosomal lineage of organelles. To determine if melanosomes contain lysosomal hydrolases, we examined the subcellular distribution of five of these enzymes in melanocytes cultured from C57BL/6J mice. Analyses of Percoll gradient density centrifugations demonstrated that β-hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, and cathepsins B and L all co-sedimented with tyrosinase-rich densely sedimenting melanosomes. The melanosomal distribution of these enzymes was confirmed in studies of melanocytes cultured from albino mice and of melanocytes rendered amelanotic by transfection with the v-rasIIa oncogene (which lack dense, melanized melanosomes). In these cells, only a less dense peak of activity for each hydrolase was present. The level of each hydrolase was elevated in black cells when compared with albino cells. Metabolic labeling studies confirmed that the increase in β-glucuronidase in black versus albino cells resulted mainly from increased synthesis of this enzyme. The data suggest that melanosomes represent specialized lysosomes present within melanocytes, that they contain a broad array of lysosomal hydrolases, and that the levels of these hydrolases are elevated in cells actively engaged in pigment production.

Melanosomes are specialized, membrane-bound subcellular organelles, unique to melanocytes, in which pigmented biopolymers called melanins are synthesized and deposited. A relationship between melanosomes and the endolysosomal lineage of organelles has long been suspected. Cytochemical staining for the activity of acid phosphatase demonstrated its presence within primary and compound melanosomes(1Seiji M. Kikuchi A. J. Invest.

Concurrently, studies involving the transfection of cDNAs encoding tyrosinase and a related protein, Trp-1, into fibroblasts (which lack authentic melanosomes) demonstrated that the proteins encoded by the transfected genes localized to intracellular vacuoles. These compartments stained positively with antisera directed against LAMP-1 and β-glucuronidase, suggesting that the organelles to which these proteins traffic in the absence of melanosomes represent either lysosomes or late endosomes(7Vijayasaradhi S.

Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). Further support for a relationship between melanosomes and lysosomes is provided by the observation that mutations in at least 10 distinct genes in the laboratory mouse result not only in a dilution of coat color but, also, in an inhibition of the normally brisk secretion by kidney cells of lysosomal hydrolases into the urine(9Novak E. Swank R. Genetics. 1979; 92: 189-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a number of autosomal recessive disorders in man, such as the Chediak-Higashi and Hermansky-Pudlak syndromes, affect both melanosomes and lysosomes in a variety of tissues (see (10Orlow S.J. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. 1994; 6: 157-184Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for review). If melanosomes and lysosomes are indeed related, we reasoned that melanosomes might contain an extensive array of lysosomal hydrolases. lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 tyrosinase-related protein benzyloxycarbonyl 4-methylcoumarin. We have now combined cell biologic techniques with the use of genetic controls to evaluate the presence of lysosomal hydrolases in melanosomes. Our results demonstrate that melanosomes are the major repository of at least five lysosomal hydrolases within melanocytes. Furthermore, we have made the surprising observation that the activities of these lysosomal hydrolases are elevated in melanocytes engaged in melanin synthesis. Metabolic labeling studies suggest that these increased levels are due in large part to an increased synthetic rate. Pigmented melanocytes cultured from C57BL/6J mice (melan-a cells(11Bennett D.C.

Hearing (NCI/NIH, Bethesda, MD) and cultured as described(11Bennett D.C. Cooper P.J. Dexter T.J. Devlin L.M. Heasman J. Nester B.

Cultured melanocytes were homogenized with a Dounce glass-glass homogenizer, and postnuclear supernatants were prepared as described(5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal quantities of cellular protein were subjected to density fractionation in self-forming 28% Percoll gradients(5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and fractions were collected from the bottom of each gradient. Following fractionation on Percoll density gradients, fractions were either frozen directly for assay of the tyrosine hydroxylase activity of tyrosinase (5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immunologic determination of the presence of members of the Trp family or were adjusted to pH 5.0 and assayed immediately for the activities of lysosomal hydrolases. β-Glucuronidase, β-hexosaminidase, and β-galactosidase were assayed by incubating 10-μl aliquots of each fraction with the respective methylumbelliferone-conjugated substrate in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, 0.1% Triton X-100 at pH 4.5 for 15 min at 37°C(13Kolodny E. Mumford R. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1976; 70: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cathepsins B and L were assayed with Cbz-Arg-Arg-4MEC and Cbz-Phe-Arg-4MEC, respectively, in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5 containing 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37°C(14Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Assays were quantitated by fluorimetry with excitation at 350 nm and emission at 460 nm using a Fluoroskan II (ICN) and results expressed as fluorescent units generated under these incubation conditions. Fractions were tested for the presence of tyrosinase protein by immunoblotting with a specific antipeptide antiserum (obtained from Dr. V. Hearing, NCI/NIH) and quantified by densitometry as described(5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following depletion of cellular methionine/cysteine stores by culture for 1 h in medium devoid of these amino acids, melanocytes were cultured for 1 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, Amersham, UK) (“pulse”) or were radiolabeled and “chased” for an additional 4 h in complete, nonradioactive medium. Cell pellets and conditioned media were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors (1 μM pepstatin, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The pellets were normalized for trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts of incorporated [35S]methionine from the pulse label and subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to murine β-glucuronidase obtained from Dr. Roger Ganschow (Cincinnati, OH). Immune complexes were harvested with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were solubilized with gel sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and equilibrated with ENHANCE (Amersham, UK) prior to exposure to a PhosphorImager, as described (Molecular Devices, CA). When the postnuclear supernatants of pigmented melanocytes (melan-a cells) cultured from the skins of newborn, wild-type, C57BL/6J mice were subjected to Percoll gradient density analysis, two peaks (one dense, one light) of the lysosomal hydrolases β-glucuronidase, β-hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase and cathepsins B and L were observed (Fig. 1, A-E, upper panels). The dense peak comigrated with the major peak of the key melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase, a marker for melanized (Stage III-IV) melanosomes as we have described previously (5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F, upper panel). Analysis of melanocytes from albino mice (melan-c cells) lacking dense Stage III-IV melanosomes due to a point mutation inactivating the critical enzyme tyrosinase demonstrated the presence of low levels of each hydrolase, limited to a lightly sedimenting compartment (Fig. 1, lowerpanels). Results similar to those obtained with melan-c cells were observed in homogenates of melan-a cells in which melanogenesis was turned off due to transfection with the v-rasIIa oncogene (melan-a-ras) (Fig. 2, lowerpanels). As reported previously, these ras-transfected cells demonstrate decreased expression of tyrosinase and the related protein Trp-1(12Tsukamoto K. Ueda M. Hearing V. Pigm. Cell Res. 1992; : 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). In both albino and ras-transfected amelanotic cell types, the comigrating dense peaks of β-glucuronidase, β-hexosaminidase, and β-galactosidase were absent (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). These results demonstrate the presence of lysosomal hydrolases within the melanosomes of cultured murine melanocytes. A surprising observation was the elevated level of these hydrolases in melan-a cells when compared with lower levels in melan-a-ras cells and even lower levels in melan-c cells. These results suggest that the levels of these lysosomal hydrolases may be related to the ability of melanocytes to synthesize melanin.Figure 2:Subcellular distribution of lysosomal hydrolases in melanocytes transfected with v-rasIIa. Melan-a cells and melan-a-ras cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation as described in Fig. 1. The activities of β-hexosaminidase and β-glucuronidase were assayed in each fraction from the Percoll density gradients. Upperpanel, melan-a; lowerpanel, melan-a-ras. A, β-hexosaminidase; B, β-glucuronidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the basis of the observed increase in intracellular levels of these lysosomal hydrolases in pigmented melanocytes, we subjected metabolically labeled cultured melanocytes to pulse-chase analysis followed by immunoprecipitation with an antiserum directed against the lysosomal hydrolase β-glucuronidase. Quantitation of biosynthesis of β-glucuronidase was achieved by scanning gel-resolved immunoprecipitates such as those shown in Fig. 3 with a PhosphorImager. Two observations were made. First, approximately three times as much radioactivity was found to be incorporated into β-glucuronidase by melan-a cells than by melan-c cells during a 60-min pulse. Second, for melan-a cells, PhosphorImaging revealed that 71% of the β-glucuronidase labeled during the pulse incubation could still be recovered from the cells after 4 h, while approximately 8% of pulse-labeled enzyme was recovered from the culture medium. By comparison, melan-c cells retained less newly synthesized β-glucuronidase (58% after 4 h) and secreted more of the enzyme (24%). Taken together, these results show that after 4 h, melan-c cells contain approximately 25% of the immunoprecipitable β-glucuronidase found in melan-a cells and that the elevated level of this enzyme in black melan-a cells compared with albino melan-c cells is due mainly to increased synthesis of the enzyme. The present study demonstrates that melanosomes are the major repository of lysosomal hydrolases in melanocytes cultured from C57BL/6J mice. Cells lacking melanized melanosomes due to mutations that inhibit pigmentation such as the albino (c) mutation or that are amelanotic because of repression of the expression of the tyrosinase-related family of enzymes (due to transfection with v-rasIIa oncogene) lack the dense, melanosomal peak of lysosomal hydrolases present in cells cultured from wild-type C57BL/6J mice. More surprising is our observation that melanized melanocytes express higher levels of certain lysosomal hydrolases than do albino and ras-transfected melanocytes not engaged in melanin synthesis. Whether the levels of lysosomal hydrolases are truly coregulated with melanin synthesis remains to be determined. Our results suggest that melanosomes may represent highly specialized members of the endolysosomal lineage of organelles. It may be advantageous for the melanocyte to restrict pigment deposition to a lysosome-like organelle. Nevertheless, the role of lysosomal hydrolases within melanosomes remains obscure. Although storage disorders due to the absence of individual hydrolases from lysosomes are not generally associated with hypopigmentation, diminished hair pigmentation may be a part of I-cell disease(15Gorlin R.J. Cohen M.M. Levin S.L. Syndromes of the Head and Neck. Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 124Google Scholar), in which mannose 6-phosphate residues are not added to the glycosyl moieties of lysosomal hydrolases, resulting in the failure of these enzymes to traffick to endosomes and lysosomes (16Hickman S. Neufeld E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 79: 992-999Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 17Varki A. Reitman M.L. Vannier A. Kornfeld S. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1982; 34: 717-729PubMed Google Scholar). It is also certainly possible that the trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases to melanosomes proceeds mainly by a pathway not dependent upon the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Additional evidence linking melanosomes with lysosomes comes from studies that demonstrate that the intramelanosomal pH is extremely acidic(3Moellman G. Slominksi A. Kuklinska E. Lerner A.B. Pigm. Cell Res. 1988; : 79-87Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Bhatnagar V. Anjaiah S. Puri N. Darshanam B.A. Ramaiah A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Acidification of intraorganellar pH is believed to be a function of the presence of a vacuolar ATPase (and related enzymes?), which imports H8 ions into endolysosomal organelles(19Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relationship between melanosomes and the endolysosomal lineage of organelles is further supported by the existence of a group of coat color mutations in the laboratory mouse, which also affect the secretion of kidney lysosomal hydrolases into the urine(9Novak E. Swank R. Genetics. 1979; 92: 189-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of these mutations also affect platelet aggregation and especially the presence of platelet dense granules, suggesting that these organelles may also share proteins in common with authentic lysosomes. We have previously demonstrated the presence of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, LAMP-1, in the delimiting membranes of melanosomes(5Orlow S.J. Boissy R.E. Moran D.J. Pifko-Hirst S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 55-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zhou B.K. Boissy R.E. Pifko-Hirst S. Moran D.J. Orlow S.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 110-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, others have corroborated this finding(20Luo D. Chen H. Jimbow K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of fibroblasts with the gene encoding tyrosinase results not only in measurable production of melanin within membrane-bound organelles but also in the up-regulated expression of LAMP-1(20Luo D. Chen H. Jimbow K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whereas melanosomes contain lysosomal membrane proteins and hydrolases, they can be clearly distinguished from other organelles such as peroxisomes(21Smit N.P.M. van Roermund C.W.T. Aerts H.M.F.G. Heikoop J.C. van den Berg M. Pavel S. Wanders R.J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our results further establish a framework by which those mutations that affect both melanosomes and lysosomes can begin to be understood at a molecular level. In addition, they suggest that melanocytes might respond to the intracellular synthesis of melanin by up-regulating the synthesis of some (if not all) lysosomal hydrolases. Future studies will undoubtedly uncover the signals that direct proteins to melanosomes, and the cloning of the genes responsible for melanolysosomal disorders will help elucidate the pathogenesis of these fascinating diseases, which are characterized by multiorganellar dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2045472987,"A copper-containing nitrite reductase (Cu-NiR) was purified to homogeneity from the denitrifying fungus Fusarium oxysporum. The enzyme seemed to consist of two subunits with almost the same Mr value of 41,800 and contains two atoms of copper per subunit. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed that both type 1 and type 2 copper centers are present in the protein, whereas the visible absorption spectrum exhibited a sole and strong absorption maximum at 595 nm, causing a blue but not green color. The reaction product due to the Cu-NiR was mainly nitric oxide (NO), whereas a stoichiometric amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) was formed when cytochrome P-450nor was further added to the assay system. Therefore, the denitrifying (N2O forming) nitrite reductase activity that we had detected in the cell-free extract of the denitrifying cells (Shoun, H., and Tanimoto, T.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11078-11082) could be reconstituted upon combination of the purified Cu-NiR and P-450nor. The Km for nitrite and specific activity at pH 7.0 were estimated as 49 μM and 447 μmol NO•min−1•mg protein−1, respectively. Its activity was strongly inhibited by cyanide, carbon monoxide, and diethyldithiocarbamate, whereas enormously restored by the addition of cupric ions. An azurin-like blue copper protein (Mr = 15,000) and a cytochrome c were also isolated from the same fungus, both of which together with cytochrome c of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were effective in donating electrons to the fungal Cu-NiR. The result suggested that the physiological electron donor of the Cu-NiR is the respiratory electron transport system. The intracellular localization of Cu-NiR was investigated, and it was suggested that the Cu-NiR localizes in an organelle such as mitochondrion. These findings showed the identity in many aspects between the fungal nitrite reductase and bacterial dissimilatory Cu-NiRs. This is the first isolation of dissimilatory NiR from a eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W2060031706,"Heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine in heparan sulfate, was purified 10,700-fold to apparent homogeneity with a 40% yield from the serum-free culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The isolation procedure included affinity chromatography of the first heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (stepwise elution), 3′,5′-ADP-agarose, and the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (gradient elution). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed two protein bands with molecular masses of 52 and 45 kDa. Both proteins appeared to be glycoproteins, because their molecular masses decreased after N-glycanase digestion. When completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin was used as acceptor, the purified enzyme transferred sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residue but did not transfer sulfate to the amino group of glucosamine residue or to position 2 of the iduronic acid residue. Heparan sulfate was also sulfated by the purified enzyme at position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residue. Chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate did not serve as acceptors. The optimal pH for enzyme activity was around 6.3. The enzyme activity was inhibited by dithiothreitol and was stimulated strongly by protamine. The Km value for adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate was 0.44 μM. Heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine in heparan sulfate, was purified 10,700-fold to apparent homogeneity with a 40% yield from the serum-free culture medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells.

The Km value for adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate was 0.44 μM. Heparan sulfate and heparin interact with a variety of proteins, such as growth factors, extracellular matrix components, and protease inhibitors, suggesting their involvement not only in a variety of cellular aspects, such as cell growth, differentiation, and cell adhesion, but also in the anticoagulation process and some pathological processes, such as viral infections(1Kjellén L.

Interactions of heparan sulfate/heparin with those ligands seem to be mediated by the binding of ligands to specific structures in heparan sulfate/heparin. For example, the basic fibroblast growth factor interacts with a cluster of GlcNSO3-IdoA(2SO4) in heparan sulfate (4Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Sito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem.

It has recently been suggested that heparan sulfate chains of cell surface and extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which could be distinguished from any known proteoglycan such as syndecan, fibroglycan, or glypican, regulate basic fibroblast growth factor receptor binding and thereby regulate the biological activity of basic fibroblast growth factor(9Aviezer D.

The response of neural cells to either acidic or basic fibroblast growth factor appears to be regulated by developmentally modulated forms of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (10Nurcombe V. Ford M.D. Wildschut J.A. Bartlett P.F. Science. 1993; 260: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate from highly metastatic tumor cells exhibited a higher degree of sulfation than that from low metastatic tumor cells, which was due to increased contents of 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residue(11Nakanishi H. Oguri K. Yoshida K. Itano N. Takenaga K. Kazama T. Yoshisa A. Okayama M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Microheterogeneity in the heparan sulfate structure, particularly in sulfation patterns at various positions, may play an important role in these cellular aspects. Thus, it is important to study how the microheterogeneity is yielded and regulated. It is suggested that O-sulfation is the final step in the modification of the structure during the biosynthesis of heparin and probably heparan sulfate as well(12Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin-Chemical and Biological Properties: Clinical Applications. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar, 13Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, O-sulfation at various positions of heparan sulfate is an important step in determining the structure of each functional domain in heparan sulfate. Various types of sulfotransferases have been shown to be responsible for the sulfation of heparin and heparan sulfate: sulfation of 2-N(14Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

We recently purified chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase with a high yield from the serum-free culture medium of chick chondrocytes(26Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found in the present study that heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase (Fig. 1) was likewise secreted into the serum-free culture medium of CHO cells, although the amount of secreted heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase was only one-fiftieth of the amount of chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase secreted from the chondrocytes. In this paper, we describe the purification to apparent homogeneity and some properties of heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase from the serum-free culture medium of CHO cells. [35S]H2SO4 was purchased from the Japan Radioisotope Association (Tokyo). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, trypsin (from bovine pancreas, type III), unlabeled PAPS, 3′,5′-ADP-agarose, and heparin were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from Cytosystems PTY Ltd. Fast desalting column HR10/10, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, and Superose 12 column HR10/30 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Partisil-10 SAX column was from Whatman (Clifton, NJ), PAMN column was from YMC (Kyoto, Japan), and Chondroitinase ABC, heparitinase I, heparitinase II, heparitinase III, chondroitin sulfate A (whale cartilage, 4-sulfate unit, 6-sulfate unit (80:20)), heparan sulfate (pig aorta), completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin), N-desulfated heparin, and unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharide kit were from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo). Recombinant N-glycanase was from Genzyme Co. [35S]PAPS was prepared as described previously(27Delfert D.M. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared as described previously(28Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CHO cells were inoculated in roller bottles (In Vitro Science Products, Inc.) at a density of about 3.3 × 107 cells/bottle and cultured for 2 days in 100 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10 mM Hepes pH 7.2 buffer, penicillin, and streptomycin. Then the culture medium was replaced every other day with 100 ml of Cosmedium-001 supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM Hepes buffer. The culture in Cosmedium-001 was continued for 10 days. The spent medium was pooled and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. To the supernatant solution, Tris-HCl, pH 7.2 (10 mM), Triton X-100 (0.1% (w/v)), MgCl2 (10 mM), CaCl2 (2 mM), and glycerol (20% (v/v)) were added to the final concentrations indicated in parentheses. The pooled medium containing these additives (16 liters) was designated as the buffered medium fraction and stored at −20°C until used. All operations were performed at 4°C. 0.1 volume of the buffered medium fraction was applied to a column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (20 × 65 mm, 20 ml) equilibrated with 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol) at the flow rate of 70 ml/h. The column was washed with 200 ml (10 volumes of a column) and then eluted with 100 ml (5 volumes of a column) of 1.0 M NaCl in buffer A. The chromatography was repeated 10 times. The eluates from 10 columns were combined, concentrated to 100 ml with polyethylene glycol 20,000 (molecular weight 15,000-25,000), and dialyzed against 0.05 M NaCl in buffer A. Half of the fraction from step 1 was applied to a column of 3′,5′-ADP-agarose (14 × 90 mm, 1.9 μmol of 3′,5′-ADP/ml of gel) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl at a flow rate of 13 ml/h. The column was washed with 120 ml of buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl. The sulfotransferase activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.2 mM 3′,5′-ADP in buffer A containing 0.05 M NaCl of total volume (150 ml). The fractions containing sulfotransferase activity (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 3) were pooled. The chromatography was performed twice, and the fractions containing the activity were combined. The step 2 fraction was applied to a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (16 × 35 mm, 5 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl at the flow rate of 13 ml/h. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A containing 0.25 M NaCl. The sulfotransferase activity was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.25 to 1.2 M NaCl in buffer A (total volume, 150 ml). The fractions containing sulfotransferase activity were pooled (indicated by a horizontal bar in Fig. 4A) and dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A. The fraction was stored at −20°C. For extraction of sulfotransferase in the cells, the cell layer was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dish in 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl, and homogenized in a glass homogenizer. The concentration of Triton X-100 in the homogenate was then increased to 0.5%. After 1 h of gentle stirring, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a small heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (bed volume, 0.6 ml), and washed with 5 ml of 0.15 M NaCl in buffer A, and then eluted with 5 ml of 1.0 M NaCl in buffer A. The standard reaction mixture contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol (as hexosamine) of CDSNS-heparin, 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (about 5 × 105 cpm), and enzyme in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the reaction tubes in a boiling water bath for 1 min. 0.1 μmol (as glucuronic acid) of chondroitin sulfate A was added to the reaction mixture as a carrier. 35S-Labeled polysaccharides were precipitated with 3 volumes of cold ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and separated completely from [35S]PAPS and its degradation products by gel chromatography using Fast desalting columns as described previously(26Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incorporation of [35S] was linear with the amounts of proteins and with the incubation time under the above conditions (up to 5.8 ng of protein and up to 30 min when the purified enzyme was used) (data not shown). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to transfer 1 pmol of sulfate/min. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins in SDS was carried out on a 10% polyacrylamide gel as described previously(29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by silver staining or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Extraction and renaturation of enzyme from the gels after SDS-PAGE were carried out essentially as described by Lind et al.(30Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as for heparin D-glucuronosyltransferase and the N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase. Before electrophoresis, the final purified enzyme in buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl was heated at 50°C for 30 min in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The gel was washed with 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and was cut into 3- or 5-mm segments and subjected to agitation at 4°C with 100 μl of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl for 48 h. The eluted enzyme was collected by centrifugation and assayed for the sulfotransferase activity. Superose 12 HR 10/30 was equilibrated with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl. 200 μl of sample was injected and eluted with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were digested with a mixture of 5 milliunits of heparitinase I, 0.5 milliunit of heparitinase II, and 5 milliunits of heparitinase III in 50 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 2 h. The specificity of each heparitinase is as follows. Heparitinase I is specific for GlcNAc or GlcNSO3 residues adjacent to GlcA in heparan sulfate. Heparitinase II is also specific for the GlcNAc and GlcNSO3 residues but not for GlcNSO3(3SO4) residue in heparan sulfate/heparin. Heparitinase III is specific for the GlcNSO3(6SO4) residues adjacent to IdoA(2SO4) in heparan sulfate/heparin (see (31Yamada S. Sakamoto K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Sugahara K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) for the details). The digested products were injected together with standard unsaturated disaccharides in a column of PAMN (4.6 mm × 25 cm). The column was developed by HPLC as described previously except for a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min(4Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Sito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 0.6-ml fractions were collected and mixed with 3 ml of Ready Safe Scintillator, and the radioactivity was determined. Degradation of the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 and reduction of the product with NaBH4 were carried out as described by Shively and Conrad (32Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the products were subjected to paper electrophoresis, and the paper strips were cut into 1.25-cm segments and counted. Released radioactive free sulfate represents the sulfate bound to the amino group of the glucosamine. Remainders of the products were subjected to gel filtration connecting two Fast desalting columns that had been equilibrated with 0.5 M NH4HCO3. The fractions corresponding to 35S-labeled disaccharides were collected and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisil-10 SAX column as described previously(4Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Sito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 33Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The galactosamine and glucosamine contents of glycosaminoglycans were determined by the Elson-Morgan method as modified by Strominger et al.(34Strominger J.L. Park J.T. Thompson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3263-3268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after hydrolysis of the glycosaminoglycans with 6 M HCl at 100°C for 4 h. Protein concentration was determined by a BCA kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 0.5 μg of the enzyme protein was digested with 0.5 unit of N-glycanase at 37°C for 16 h according to the method recommended by the manufacturer except for omitting mercaptoethanol. Sulfotransferase activity was secreted into the serum-free medium (Cosmedium-001 supplemented with sodium ascorbate) under the conditions used (Table 1). The spent medium of CHO cells contained the highest sulfotransferase activity among the three cell lines tested. 35S-Labeled polysaccharides, which were formed from CDSNS-heparin by incubation with the culture medium of CHO cells or FM3A cells, were digested with heparitinase. The products were identified by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Major radioactivity was recovered in a peak of ΔDi-(N,6)diS, and a small amount of radioactivity was detected in a peak of ΔDi-(N,U)diS as a shoulder (peaks 3 and 4, respectively, in Fig. 2, A and B). The ratio of ΔDi-(N,U)diS to ΔDi-(N,6)diS was 0.04 for CHO cells and 0.25 for FM3A cells. No radioactive sulfate was released when 35S-labeled products were subjected to nitrous acid degradation at pH 1.5 (Fig. 2 C). The results indicate that only O-sulfation occurred in the substrate without any N-sulfation under the reaction conditions used. Furthermore, the results also indicate that major sulfotransferase secreted by CHO cells catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of N-sulfoglucosamine residue in heparan sulfate (this enzyme was hereafter designated as heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase) (Fig. 1). The activity of heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase in the CHO cell layer extract was 0.65 unit/2 × 107 cells and less than 10% of the activity in the culture medium.Table I Open table in a new tab Based on the above observations, we decided to use the spent medium of CHO cells as an enzyme source and succeeded in purifying the enzyme to an apparent homogeneity with about 10,700-fold purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Table 2 shows a summary of the purification of the sulfotransferase from 16 liters of the buffered medium fraction. The details for each step are as follows.Table II Open table in a new tab The buffered medium fraction was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. Most proteins absorbed to the column were eluted in 0.25 M NaCl fraction, and heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase activity was eluted in 1 M NaCl fraction. Compared with chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase(26Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase had a high affinity to heparin. After this chromatography, the total activity of heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase increased about 1.6-fold, suggesting that some inhibitors of heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase and/or degradating enzymes of PAPS might be removed at this purification step. This column chromatography resulted in a 35-fold purification of the sulfotransferase (Fig. 3). Because the sulfotransferase appeared to be less stable in 0.05 M NaCl than in 0.15 M NaCl, each eluate was collected in tubes containing 1.0 M NaCl in buffer A to make the solution of 0.15 M NaCl at the final concentration. 3′,5′-ADP strongly inhibited heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase as described previously in other glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases(15Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of 3′,5′-ADP giving a 50% inhibition was less than 2.5 μM. Enzyme activity at this step, therefore, was determined after the removal of 3′,5′-ADP by absorbing the enzyme to a small heparin-Sepharose column and eluting with 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Chondroitin sulfotransferase activity was eluted at the lower NaCl concentration than heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase activity (Fig. 4A). This chondroitin sulfotransferase activity catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of N-acetylgalactosamine residue in chondroitin or chondroitin sulfate A but not to position 6 of N-acetylgalactosamine residue (data not shown). Fig. 4B shows SDS-PAGE for fraction numbers 25-49 in the second heparin-Sepharose column chromatography. Judging from the elution pattern of the enzyme activity, two protein bands of Mr 52,000 and 45,000 seem to correspond to the sulfotransferase. Samples at each purification step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). Two bands of Mr 52,000 and 45,000 were predominantly stained with silver nitrate in the second heparin-Sepharose fraction (Fig. 5, lane 4). There was no significant difference in the mobilities of the two protein bands before and after reduction (Fig. 5, lane 4 versus lane 5). In order to see if the two protein bands were responsible for the enzyme activity, proteins in the gel segments following SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme were extracted and assayed for heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase activity after renaturation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Extracts from the segments corresponding to the 52- and the 45-kDa protein bands showed significant activity with a ratio of 1 to 2 (varied between experiments), irrespective of the low recovery of the activity (less than 2%) (data not shown). When the second heparin-Sepharose fraction was applied to a Superose 12 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl, heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase activity was eluted in the fractions around Mr 49,000 (Fig. 6), which was between the molecular weights of the two protein bands on SDS-PAGE. These observations suggested that both protein bands bear the sulfotransferase activity. When the N-glycanase digest of this fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE, protein bands of 52 and 45 kDa disappeared, whereas protein bands of 43 and 38 kDa appeared (Fig. 7). This result indicated that both proteins were glycoproteins containing more than 15% of carbohydrate.Figure 6:Superose 12 gel chromatography of heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase. Heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase eluted from the second heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A containing 2 M NaCl. 200 μl of concentrated solution was injected into a Superose 12 column and eluted with buffer A containing 2 M NaCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase activity (•) of each fraction was assayed.

The combination of plasma membrane-enriched fraction and cytosol was sufficient to activate NF-κB in a LPS/CD14-dependent manner only in the presence of ATP as judged by the binding of NF-κB to the IL-8 gene κB site on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. LPS-dependent NF-κB activation was inhibited by protein kinase inhibitors, such as staurosporine, herbimycin A, tyrphostin, and genistein, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase substrate, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitory peptides, suggesting that staurosporine-sensitive kinase(s) as well as tyrosine kinase(s) are involved in LPS-mediated NF-κB activation. In addition, LPS induced the phosphorylation of IκB-α, starting at 5 min after the stimulation in a cell-free system.

Both sequences contain tyrosine activation motifs implicated in antigen receptor signal transduction. TTγ and TTβ are expressed independently of the native Fc∊R1, as demonstrated by the ability of Tac cross-linking agents to trigger the clustering and internalization through coated pits of both chimeric receptors without co-clustering the Fc∊R1. A full range of signaling activities is induced by TTγ cross-linking; the TTγ-induced responses are slower and, except for Lyn activation, smaller than the Fc∊R1-induced responses. In striking contrast, TTβ cross-linking elicits no tyrosine phosphorylation or signaling responses, it impairs basal activities measured in secretion and anti-PY (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) immune complex kinase assays, and it antagonizes Fc∊R1-induced Lyn and Syk activation, protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, and signaling responses. We hypothesize that the isolated β subunit binds a specific kinase or coupling protein(s) required for signaling activity, sequestering it from the signal-transducing γ subunit.

The derived amino acid sequence of the SREHP cDNA clone was remarkable for a high serine content (52/233 amino acids), a putative signal sequence, multiple hydrophilic dodecapeptide and octapeptide tandem repeats, and a hydrophobic C-terminal putative membrane-spanning region. Here, we show that SREHP is modified by the addition of phosphate at serine residues, O-linked terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues, and by acylation. When the SREHP gene is expressed in baculovirus transformed Sf-9 cells, the product is also phosphorylated and glycosylated and is localized to the plasma membrane of the insect cells.

Metabolic radiolabeling of 48-h cultures containing 4 × 106 HM1:IMSS trophozoites using [3H]glucosamine, carrier-free [32P]phosphate, or [9,10-3H]palmitate was performed exactly as detailed(8Stanley Jr., S.L. Huizenga H. Li E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After labeling, trophozoites were harvested, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.15 M sodium chloride (TBS) containing 0.2 mML-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM EDTA. The lysate was spun at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with either rabbit polyclonal anti-SREHP antibodies adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia LKB Biotech) using the manufacturer's protocol or with 2D4 Sepharose(8Stanley Jr., S.L. Huizenga H. Li E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The native SREHP molecule was isolated from detergent lysates of trophozoites by affinity chromatography over 2D4-Sepharose. The column was washed with lysis buffer, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl. SREHP was eluted from the column with 3.2 M MgCl2 and was immediately dialyzed under vacuum against 0.1 M NH4 acetate. The SREHP was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography over QAE-Sepharose or by preparative SDS-PAGE. Affinity purified SREHP was applied to a 3-ml QAE column which was serially washed with 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing no additional salt, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.2 M NaCl. The SREHP was eluted with 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.4 M NaCl. SREHP was eluted from the excised polyacrylamide gel slice and acetone precipitated to remove residual detergent. The purity of the SREHP fraction was checked by SDS-PAGE and detected either by autoradiography in the case of radiolabeled SREHP and by silver stain (in the case of unlabeled material). Silver staining of SDS-PAGE separated fractions was performed using the Bio-Rad Silver Stain Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of gel-purified SREHP were subjected to quantitative amino acid analysis, phosphate analysis, and carbohydrate analysis. The amount of protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis as described previously(9Li E. Locke B. Yang N.C. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13773-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 54 pmol of SREHP was acid hydrolyzed in 0.5 ml of 4 N HCl for 4 h at 100°C in an evacuated sealed tube. After hydrolysis the HCl was removed by lyophilization, and the hydrolysate was dissolved in 16 mM NaOH. Total phosphate was quantitated using the ashing procedure described by Ames(10Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (2989) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide composition was determined, after acid hydrolysis in 4 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h in an evacuated sealed tube, by high pH anion-exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection on a Dionex CarboPac PA1 column using 2-deoxyglucose as an internal standard. Phosphoamino acid analysis of [32P]phosphatelabeled SREHP was performed as described(11Heisermann G.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13152-13158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μg of purified SREHP was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose filters were probed using the DIG glycan differentiation kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and digoxigenin-labeled Galanthus nivilus agglutinin (GNA), Concanavalin A agglutinin (ConA), Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA), and Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. 0.5 μg of purified SREHP was labeled with 5 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]galactose (60 Ci/ml) using β-galactosyltransferase provided in the O-GlcNAc detection kit (Oxford GlycoSystems, Rosedale, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol(12Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) covalently linked to N-acetylglucosamine through a CETE spacer arm ((β-D-GlcNAc-O-CETE)∼8-BSA) was used as a positive control. After labeling, the reaction mixture was precipitated with 10 volumes of cold acetone and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or used for β-elimination analysis. For β-elimination, the [3H]galactose-labeled SREHP was treated with 0.3 ml of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, 1 M sodium borohydride for 18 h at 37°C as described by Holt and Hart(13Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8049-8057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by paper chromatography. The chromatogram was developed using pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3) for 18 h. Reduced forms of disaccharide standards (lactose and N-acetyllactosamine) were run simultaneously and visualized by silver nitrate staining. The purified [3H]palmitate-labeled SREHP was aliquoted into 70-μl samples (80,000 counts/mim/sample) and lyophilized. For sodium hydroxide cleavage, samples were reconstituted with 180 μl of 100% ethanol, followed by addition of either 20 μl of H2O or 20 μl of 0.5 M NaOH, and they were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, acidified, and extracted with toluene(14Ferguson M.A.J. Brodbeck U. Bordier C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins by Lipids : A Laboratory Manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 1-8Google Scholar). Samples were lyophilized, then reconstituted in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. For thin layer chromatography, the toluene phase was concentrated under a N2 stream and spotted on reverse-phase high performance thin layer chromatography plates (RP 18; Merck) with labeled fatty acid standards. The plates were developed in acetonitrile/acetic acid (1:1, v/v) as described previously(15Bizzozero O.A. Fridal K. Pastuszyn A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN) and exposed to Kodak XAR film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester NY) at −70°C. For hydroxylamine release, samples were reconstituted with either 60 μl of 1 M NH2OHHCl, pH 8.0, or 60 μl of 1 M Tris, pH 8.0, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, then processed for SDS-PAGE autoradiography as above(16Magee A.I. Koyama A.H. Malfer C. Wen D. Schlesinger M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 798: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For nitrous acid deamination, samples were reconstituted in 30 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer, pH 4.0, and 30 μl of freshly prepared 0.5 M NaNO2 or in 30 μl of sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer and 30 μl of 0.5 M NaCl(14Ferguson M.A.J. Brodbeck U. Bordier C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins by Lipids : A Laboratory Manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 1-8Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h, then prepared for SDS-PAGE autoradiography as above. The cDNA encoding the full-length SREHP sequence was amplified in order to incorporate convenient restriction sites using the polymerase chain reaction with the forward primer I, GCCATGGTCGCATTTTTATTGTTTATTGCATTCACTAGTGCA (with the recognition sequence for NcoI) the reverse primer II, TGAGCTCCTATTAGAAGATGATAGCTATAAT (with the recognition sequence for SacI), and pF3F1 as the template DNA(1Stanley Jr., S.L.

The NcoI/SacI cDNA insert was ligated with NcoI/SacI-digested donor plasmid pMON14327 in order to insert the SREHP coding sequences into an expression cassette comprising a baculovirus promoter that is flanked by the left and right ends of Tn7. The resulting donor plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH 10B harboring the target bacmid bMON14272 and the helper plasmid pMON 7124(17Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J.

The recombinant bacmid, bSREHP was isolated, then transfected into Sf-9 cells using a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol(17Luckow V.A. Lee S.C. Barry G.F. Olins P.O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4566-4579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of 3 × 106Sf-9 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units/cell and incubated at 28°C for 72 h(7DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For isolation of SREHP, the infected cells were lysed by sonication, spun at 4000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet resuspended in 4% CHAPS in PBS. After a second spin, the supernatant was collected, diluted to 1% CHAPS, then loaded on a 2D4-Sepharose column or used for immunoprecipitation studies as described above. Metabolic labeling of Sf-9 cells was performed 48 h post infection. [32P]Phosphate labeling was performed in phosphate-free Grace's medium containing inorganic [32P]phosphate (0.8 mCi/ml) for 5 h at 28°C(7DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate labeling was performed in 5 ml of complete Grace's media containing 1 mCi of [3H]palmitate (6 h at 28°C), and Sf-9 cells were labeled with glucosamine by incubation in glucose-free Grace's media (5 ml) containing 1 mCi of [3H]glucosamine for 6 h at 28°C. Staining was carried out on live trophozoites, fixed and permeabilized trophozoites, and on fixed and permeabilized baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells expressing SREHP. Immunostaining of live trophozoites was carried out by incubating live trophozoites with a 1:500 dilution of two-dimensional-4 or an isotype matched control antibody HDP-1 in α-minimal essential medium with 5.7 mM cysteine, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% BSA (test medium) at 4°C for 1 h. In some samples the synthetic peptide containing the SREHP dodecapeptide repeat S-S-S-D-K-P-D-N-K-P-E-A was added during incubation with the primary antibody. After washing with test media, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was added to the trophozoites (1:300 dilution in test media) at 4°C for 1 h. Following washes with test media, and PBS, 104 trophozoites were resuspended in 50% glycerol in PBS, placed on coverslips, and mounted on microscope slides. For immunostaining of fixed, permeabilized trophozoites, 6 × 104 HM1:IMSS trophozoites were incubated on coverslips in 24-well plates at 37°C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the adherent trophozoites were fixed in 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 2 min at room temperature, washed with PBS three times, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, washed two times with PBS, and blocked for with 2% BSA in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with monoclonal antibody 2D4 or an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody HDP-1 (diluted 1:500 in 0.2% BSA) overnight at 4°C(18Stanley Jr., S.L. Li E. Davie J.M. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After four washes, (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:300 dilution) was added for 45 min at room temperature in the dark, then coverslips were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS on microscope slides, and sealed with nail polish. Immunofluorescence staining of formalin-fixed baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 was carried out using a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal antibody 2D4 or an isotype-matched control monoclonal antibody 1B10 as described previously(7DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Images were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope fitted with a Bio-Rad MRC Confocal Imaging System under a × 63 objective. Photomultiplier amplification was kept constant in each experiment. Images were normalized over five scans and photographed directly from a NEC Multisync monitor. This assay, which uses 6.5-mm Transwell plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA), measures the migration of E. histolytica trophozoites from an upper chamber to a lower chamber through a 8.0-μm pore polycarbonate membrane and was performed as described by Bailey et al.(19Bailey G.B. Leitch G.J. Day D.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In brief, E. histolytica HM1:IMSS trophozoites were suspended in a reference media (RM) of 10 mM potassium phosphate, 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.57 mM cysteine, pH 6.3, at a concentration of 106/ml. The top and lower chambers of the Transwells were separated, and 50 μl of the amebic suspension was added to 100 μl of RM in each of the top wells. To the lower chambers was added 0.5 ml of the sample to be tested, dissolved in RM. The chambers were replaced, incubated for 2 h at 37°C, then the top chamber was removed, and the number of amebae present in the lower chamber counted using an inverted microscope. In vivo labeling immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that [3H]glucosamine, [32P]phosphate, and [3H]palmitate were incorporated into SREHP (see Fig. 1, A-C). SREHP did not incorporate either [3H]ethanolamine, [3H]myo-inositol, or [3H]myristate (data not shown). The native SREHP molecule was isolated from HM1:IMSS trophozoite lysates using affinity chromatography with monoclonal antibody 2D4. This material was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography or by preparative SDS-PAGE. A silver stain of a SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified SREHP molecule is shown in Fig. 2. The phosphate content of purified unlabeled SREHP was estimated to be 17 mol/mol SREHP (as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis). The amount of protein purified was insufficient for accurate stoichiometric determination of carbohydrate content but confirmed the presence of glucosamine (∼1 mol/mol SREHP). Galactosamine was not detected in the sample. SREHP was purified from [32P]phosphate-labeled E. histolytica trophozoites and analyzed for phosphoamino acids. As shown in Fig. 3, phosphoserine but not phosphotyrosine or phosphothreonine was detected in SREHP. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of SREHP revealed the absence of any N-linked glycosylation sites but multiple potential O-glycosylation sites. The amount of radiolabeled glucosamine label incorporated into purified SREHP during in vivo labeling was insufficient to directly characterize. Binding of GNA, PNA, ConA, RCA, and DSA to purified SREHP could not be detected under conditions in which GNA binding to the E. histolytica lipophosphoglycan-like molecule (8Stanley Jr., S.L. Huizenga H. Li E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was observed (data not shown). In order to investigate the possibility that SREHP contained terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues, purified SREHP was incubated with bovine milk galactosyltransferase and UDP-[3H]galactose. As shown in Fig. 4, SREHP was labeled with [3H]galactose. The label was sensitive to mild alkali-induced β-elimination. The major labeled β-eliminated product of galactosyltransferase-labeled SREHP co-migrated with the major β-eliminated product of galactosyltransferase-labeled (β-D-GlcNAc-O-CETE)∼8-BSA and with Galβ1-4GlcNAcitol, (Fig. 5) thus demonstrating that single GlcNac residues are O-glycosidically linked to SREHP. Treatment of acylated proteins with hydroxylamine or with dithiothreitol releases S-ester-bound acyl chains or very labile O-ester-bound acyl chains(15Bizzozero O.A. Fridal K. Pastuszyn A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Magee A.I. Koyama A.H. Malfer C. Wen D. Schlesinger M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 798: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Treatment with NaOH in ethanol will also release O-ester-bound chains, whereas amide bonds are resistant to both of these treatments(14Ferguson M.A.J. Brodbeck U. Bordier C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins by Lipids : A Laboratory Manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 1-8Google Scholar). Treatment with NaOH caused release of incorporated [3H]palmitate from SREHP (Fig. 6). Analysis of the released product revealed that 50% of the incorporated [3H]palmitate was released by treatment with NaOH, and the released radioactivity comigrated with palmitate (data not shown). No release of 3H was observed after treatment with hydroxylamine (Fig. 6), and treatment with 200 mM dithiothreitol (15Bizzozero O.A. Fridal K. Pastuszyn A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) failed to release the label from SREHP, although another 95 kDa species that was labeled with [3H]]palmitate was sensitive to this treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that acyl chains in SREHP are attached by O-ester bonds rather than S-ester bonds. In order to determine whether the acyl chains are incorporated via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, [3H]palmitate-labeled SREHP was subjected to treatment with nitrous acid, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D. As shown in Fig. 6, nitrous acid failed to release the lipid. Neither treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C nor phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D released the radiolabel (data not shown) under conditions in which label was released from [3H]myristate-labeled trypanosomal variant surface glycoprotein or from E. histolytica lipophosphoglycan (data not shown). The monoclonal antibody 2D4, which is directed against the repeating dodecapeptide sequence in SREHP, was used to detect SREHP on live and fixed trophozoites (see Fig. 7). Immunostaining of live trophozoites demonstrated surface labeling (see Fig. 7A), which was blocked by the addition of the synthetic peptide corresponding to the dodecapeptide repeat (data not shown). The control monoclonal antibody HDP-1 did not react with intact trophozoites (see Fig. 7B). Immunostaining of fixed, permeabilized trophozoites with 2D4 revealed internal staining with a focal distribution, which may correspond to the tubular network or reticulum of anastomosing endoexocytic channels and vesicles present in these organisms (reviewed in (20Lushbaugh W.B. Miller J.H. Ravdin J.I. Amebiasis : Human Infection by Entamoeba Histolytica. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 41-68Google Scholar), in addition to surface labeling (see Fig. 7C). The background level of staining observed with a control antibody HDP-1 is shown in Fig. 7D. Expression of SREHP in baculovirus infected Sf-9 cells was confirmed by Western blotting which revealed a species at 45 kDa which reacted with monoclonal antibody 2D4 in SREHP-transformed Sf-9 cells, but not in cells expressing a Na+,K+-ATPase polypeptide (7DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). SREHP expression and localization to the surface membrane was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody 2D4 (Fig. 8). 2D4 reacted with the surface membrane of baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells expressing SREHP (panel A) but showed no reactivity with control baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells expressing the Na+,K+-ATPase polypeptide (panel B) (7DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1470-1478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SREHP expressed in Sf-9 cells was also phosphorylated, glycosylated, and acylated, we immunoprecipitated the SREHP molecule from lysates of SREHP-expressing Sf-9 cells which had been metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphate, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]palmitate. As shown in Fig. 9, SREHP expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf-9 cells is phosphorylated. SREHP expressed in Sf-9 cells also incorporated glucosamine, but we were unable to detect [3H]palmitate label in baculovirus-expressed SREHP (data not shown). Bailey et al.(19Bailey G.B. Leitch G.J. Day D.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) described a number of substances that were capable of attracting amebic migration through an 8-μm filter. Potent chemoattractants included TYI-S-33 media and bacteria. An enzymatic digest of casein, a secreted phosphoprotein that contains multiple phosphorylated serine and threonine residues, appears to be the chief component of TYI-S-33 media exhibiting chemoattractant properties(19Bailey G.B. Leitch G.J. Day D.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because the SREHP molecule contains multiple phosphorylated serine residues, we were interested in determining whether the purified native SREHP had chemoattractant properties. We examined the chemoattractant properties of a reference media (negative control), TYI-33 media, a 1% and 0.2% solution of casein, an amebic lysate (8Stanley Jr., S.L. Huizenga H. Li E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) diluted 1:50, a 0.01% solution of purified native SREHP, a 0.01% solution of purified amebic lipophosphoglycan molecule(8Stanley Jr., S.L. Huizenga H. Li E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a 1% solution of BSA. Trophozoites migrated to the lower chamber in response to SREHP in numbers greater than the reference media (p < 0.001), amebic lysate (p < 0.04), BSA (p < 0.005), and the amebic lipophosphoglycan (p < 0.002) (Table 1). The concentration of SREHP utilized was equipotent to a 1% casein solution and TYI-33 media in attracting amebae and was significantly more potent than the lower concentration of casein. A number of putative surface molecules of E. histolytica have now been described, but structural information on only a few of these molecules is available ((8, 21, 22), reviewed in (23Stanley Jr., S.L. Li E. Sem. Gastroint. Dis. 1993; 4: 214-223Google Scholar). Previously, we described the isolation and sequence analysis of a cDNA clone and the gene encoding the SREHP(1Stanley Jr., S.L. Becker A. Kunz-Jenkins C. Foster L. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 24Li E. Kunz-Jenkins C. Stanley Jr., S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The derived amino acid sequence of the SREHP cDNA clone possessed a high serine content (52 of 233 amino acids) and contained a putative signal sequence, multiple hydrophilic octapeptide and dodecapeptide tandem repeats, and a C-terminal hydrophobic probable membrane spanning domain giving it a secondary structure reminiscent of the circumsporozoite proteins of malaria(1Stanley Jr., S.L. Becker A. Kunz-Jenkins C. Foster L. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that SREHP was associated with the membrane fraction in amebic lysates(1Stanley Jr., S.L. Becker A. Kunz-Jenkins C. Foster L. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observation that antibodies to bacterially expressed recombinant SREHP inhibited amebic adhesion to Chinese hamster ovary cells (1Stanley Jr., S.L. Becker A. Kunz-Jenkins C. Foster L. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was consistent with a surface location for native SREHP molecule on trophozoites. In order to examine the distribution of SREHP, live intact or permeabilized trophozoites were stained with 2D4, a monoclonal antibody directed against the tandem repeating units, and were examined by confocal microscopy. These studies indicated that these repeating units of SREHP were exposed on the extracellular surface. Examination of permeabilized cells revealed that this epitope was also present in a focal distribution within the organism. We have found that the native SREHP molecule is phosphorylated and contains terminal O-linked GlcNAc residues. Proteins containing terminal O-linked GlcNAc residues have been described previously in a number of eukaryotes including the parasites Schistosoma mansoni(25Nyame K. Cummings R.D. Damian R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7990-7995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and P. falciparum(26Din N.-U. Drager-Dayal R. Decrind C. Hu B.-H. Del Giudice G. Hoessli D. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 55-64PubMed Google Scholar). Terminal O-GlcNAc residues have been found in a wide variety of proteins, many of which are also phosphorylated and specifically associate with other proteins to form multimeric complex structures. This modification appears to be restricted largely to the nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic compartments (reviewed in (27Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Blomberg M.A. Dong L.-Y.D. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although initial studies detected O-GlcNAc on the surfaces of lymphocytes (12Torres C.-R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further studies with refined methods of lymphocyte isolation have shown that surface localization is virtually undetectable(27Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Blomberg M.A. Dong L.-Y.D. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is possible that this modification may take place in other compartments since galactose labeling was detected within the lumen as well as on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum(28Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A P. falciparum 195-kDa merozoite surface antigen (MSA-1) which has been localized to the surface membrane of free merozoites (29Holder A.A. Progr. Allergy. 1988; 41: 148-172PubMed Google Scholar) has been reported to contain terminal O-linked GlcNac residues(26Din N.-U. Drager-Dayal R. Decrind C. Hu B.-H. Del Giudice G. Hoessli D. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 55-64PubMed Google Scholar). There are multiple potential sites for phosphorylation and for the addition of terminal O-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues in the dodecapeptide repeats (S-S-S-D-K-P-D-N-K-P-E-A) and the octapeptide repeats (S-S-T-A-K-P-E-A). Little is known about which form of kinase is responsible for phosphorylating the SREHP molecule. Examination of the derived amino acid sequence of SREHP reveals multiple potential sites for phosphorylation of serine residues by either casein kinase I or casein kinase II. Specifically, the dodecapeptide repeats of SREHP contain both the sequence S-X-X-D (S-S-S-D), which is the minimum requirement for substrate recognition by casein kinase II, and E-X-S-S (E-A-S-S), a sequence recognized by casein kinase I(30Tuazon T.P. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar). A possible candidate is a rac family protein kinase that was recently identified in E. histolytica (Ehrac1)(31Que X. Samuelson J. Reed S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which appears to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine residues in vitro(32Que X. Reed S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The observation that rat liver cytosolic O-GlcNAc:peptide glycosyltransferase appears to require nearby proline residues and is affected by the distance of the hydroxy amino acid from the proline moiety (reviewed in (27Haltiwanger R.S. Kelly W.G. Roquemore E.P. Blomberg M.A. Dong L.-Y.D. Kreppel L. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) is of interest since proline residues are also present in the vicinity of the hydroxyamino acids within the repeating units. It remains a paradox how the SREHP molecule, which has been localized to the surface membrane, and does not contain a putative cytosolic domain, contains modifications that are generally associated with the cytosolic compartment. One potential explanation is that the modifications are restricted to SREHP molecules which are present in internal structures. Another is that this modification may not be restricted to the cytoplasmic compartment in E. histolytica. Little is known about how E. histolytica processes membrane-bound and secreted proteins. Ultrastructural studies of the trophozoite reveal a poorly developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the absence of Golgi (reviewed in (20Lushbaugh W.B. Miller J.H. Ravdin J.I. Amebiasis : Human Infection by Entamoeba Histolytica. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 41-68Google Scholar). They appear to be functionally replaced by a tubular network or reticulum of anastomosing endoexocytic channels and vacuoles (reviewed in (20Lushbaugh W.B. Miller J.H. Ravdin J.I. Amebiasis : Human Infection by Entamoeba Histolytica. John Wiley & Sons, New York1988: 41-68Google Scholar). Interestingly, when the SREHP gene is expressed in baculovirus infected Sf-9 cells, the recombinant protein is also detected at the surface membrane and undergoes both phosphorylation and glycosylation (although we have not yet determined whether baculovirus produced SREHP contains phosphoserine or O-GlcNAc). The native SREHP is also acylated via an O-ester linkage. The lipid does not appear to be linked via a GPI anchor, (a prevalent motif among parasite surface proteins, including at least one E. histolytica protein(21McCoy J.J. Mann B.J. Vedvick T.S. Pak Y. Heimark D.B. Petri Jr., W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24223-24231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or via an S-ester linkage. O-ester linkages via a threonine residue have been previously reported in bovine brain myelin lipophilin(33Stoffel W. Hillen H. Schroder W. Deutzman R. Hoppes-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 1455-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There are multiple potential sites in the SREHP molecule for direct O-ester acylation. Ser51 and Ser52 of SREHP are located within the otherwise hydrophobic putative transmembrane domain of the molecule and would appear to be likely locations for acylation. Of note, we were unable to incorporate [3H]palmitate into SREHP expressed by baculovirus infected Sf-9 cells. While the function of SREHP remains to be defined, the native SREHP molecule promoted migration of amebae in vitro. Two other phosphoproteins, casein and osteopontin, have been reported to promote migration for amebae (19Bailey G.B. Leitch G.J. Day D.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells(34Liaw L. Almeida M. Hart C.E. Schwartz S.M. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 214-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), respectively, in vitro. We have observed that amebae tend to aggregate together when placed on a monolayer of target cells and that trophozoite-trophozoite contact appears to be associated with increased motility of amebae and increased destruction of the monolayer(35Li E. Becker A. Stanley Jr., S.L. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 8-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. Li, unpublished observations. We can speculate that SREHP might serve as a signal to attract E. histolytica trophozoites to one another; trophozoite-trophozoite contact might be a stimulus for increased motility, and increased production of soluble factors (amebapore, cysteine proteinase) involved in amebic invasion and tissue destruction(23Stanley Jr., S.L. Li E. Sem. Gastroint. Dis. 1993; 4: 214-223Google Scholar). We thank Drs. Jacques Baenziger and Rosalind Kornfeld for assistance with the carbohydrate analysis and many helpful discussions, Drs. Vernon Luckow and Robert Mercer for assistance with the baculovirus system, Dr. Linda Pike for help in phosphoamino acid analysis, and Lynne Foster for technical assistance.

The question of whether the Prt1-containing protein complex represents the yeast homologue of mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-3 is discussed. INTRODUCTIONTranslation initiation is a multistep pathway, which positions an 80 S ribosome with bound initiator Met-tRNAi at the initiator AUG codon of an open reading frame on mRNA(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the main initiation pathway is cap-dependent; ribosomes bind near the cap structure m7GpppN at the 5′ end of mRNA and then scan the mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction until they encounter an initiator AUG codon(3Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). These reactions are catalyzed by a large number of polypeptides, the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Experiments with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that translation initiation in this lower eukaryote strongly resembles cap-dependent initiation in mammals(4Müller P.P. Trachsel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Linder P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar). This is perhaps most convincingly demonstrated by the finding that some mammalian initiation factors can substitute for yeast factors in vivo(7Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwelberger H.G. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol.

Yeast. 1986; 2: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and powerful genetic approaches make this system an attractive model system to study the mechanism and regulation of translation in eukaryotes.Most of the translation initiation factors identified earlier in the mammalian system have also been isolated and their genes cloned from S. cerevisiae(4Müller P.P. Trachsel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Linder P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, yeast initiation factors were identified and their genes cloned whose mammalian homologues are not yet known(6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Wek R.C. Dever T.E. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 87-115Crossref Google Scholar).Among the few initiation factors that have not yet been isolated from yeast is the factor eIF-3. Mammalian eIF-3 is composed of eight polypeptide chains with a total mass of about 550 kDa(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments showed that this factor is involved in several consecutive steps in the initiation pathway including ribosome dissociation, Met-tRNAi binding to 40 S ribosomes, and mRNA binding to 40 S•Met-tRNAi complexes(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar).The analysis of the yeast mutant strain prt1-1 originally isolated by Hartwell (12Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Prt1 protein stimulates the interaction of the ternary complex eIF-2•GTP•Met-tRNAi with the 40 S ribosomal subunit(13Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings and unpublished data, 2K. Moldave and C. S. McLaughlin, unpublished data. Moldave and McLaughlin (14Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. NATO ASI Ser. 1988; 14: 271-281Google Scholar) suggested that the PRT1 gene may encode a subunit of eIF-3.

Trachsel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) allowed attempts to purify Prt1. Here, we show that Prt1 is a subunit of a protein complex that may be the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF-3.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of the Prt1-containing Protein ComplexHomogenization of CellsStrain ABYS (a,pra1,prb1,prc1,prs1,ade(18Achstetter T.

About 100 g of cells (wet weight) were resuspended in 200 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and homogenized with 1 volume of glass beads in a bead beater (Biospec Products) for 2 min at 0°C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 0-4°C.Preparation of Ribosomal Salt WashThe homogenate was first centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 15 min, then at 23,000 × g for 15 min, and finally at 260,000 × g for 2 h. The resulting supernatant was frozen and the pellet (crude ribosomes) resuspended in 60 ml of buffer A containing 0.35 M KCl at a concentration of about 200 A260/ml. Ribosomes were pelleted at 260,000 × g for 2 h and proteins in the the ribosomal wash fraction (supernatant) precipitated by addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 to 70% saturation. Precipitated protein was pelleted at 7,500 × g for 15 min, dissolved in 10 ml of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and dialyzed against this buffer overnight.DEAE ChromatographyThe ribosomal salt wash fraction was diluted to 25 ml with buffer B and loaded onto a DEAE column (2-cm diameter, 50-ml volume) preequilibrated with buffer B. Unbound protein was washed out with buffer B and bound protein eluted stepwise with buffer B containing 150 mM KCl and buffer B containing 300 mM KCl at a flow rate of about 13 ml/h.Phosphocellulose ChromatographyThe 300 mM KCl step eluate from the DEAE column was diluted with buffer C (30 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA) to a final KCl concentration of 100 mM and applied to a phosphocellulose column (1.5-cm diameter, 16-ml volume) preequilibrated with buffer C containing 100 mM KCl. Unbound protein was washed out with buffer C containing 100 mM KCl and bound protein eluted with buffer C containing 300 mM KCl. The 300 mM KCl eluate fraction was precipitated by dialysis against (NH4)2SO4 (70% saturation), and precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, dissolved in 0.3 ml of buffer B, and dialyzed against buffer B for 5 h.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation300 μl of dialyzed 300 mM KCl eluate from the phosphocellulose column was applied to a 12-ml 5-30% sucrose gradient in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA. The sucrose gradient was centrifuged at 290,000 × g for 16 h. The tube was then punctured at the bottom and 0.5-ml fractions collected.SDS-PAGE and Western BlottingSDS-PAGE (19Anderson C.W. Baum P.R. Gesteland R.F. J. Virol. 1973; 12: 241-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Western blotting (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44704) Google Scholar) were done as described. Silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels was done according to Oakley et al.(21Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar).Polyclonal Rat Anti-Prt1 AntibodyA 2900-base pair EcoRI DNA fragment containing the entire PRT1 open reading frame starting at the most 5′-proximal EcoRI restriction site (16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cloned into the phage λ gt11(22Young R.A. Davies R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cells were infected with recombinant phage, and the synthesis of the β-galactosidase-Prt1 hybrid protein was induced on agar plates under conditions of cell lysis as described(22Young R.A. Davies R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were collected from agar plates and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the hybrid protein was excised and eluted from gel slices with an Electro-Eluter (model 422, Bio-Rad). Polyclonal antibodies against Prt1 were obtained by injecting rats intraperitoneally with 12 μg of β-galactosidase-Prt1 hybrid protein in 50% complete Freund's adjuvant. The injection was repeated two times with incomplete Freund's adjuvant at intervals of 10 days. The rat was killed by cervical dislocation, and blood was collected from the heart and centrifuged; serum was stored in aliquots at −70°C.In Vitro TranslationThe strain P501-1 (a,his6,ura3,prt1-1) was used for the preparation of the cell-free translation system. Preparation of the extract, cell-free translation, and the preparation of total yeast RNA were as described earlier(23Altmann M. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6085-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Expression of Prt1 Protein from pGAL Promoter in VivoThe plasmid pGEM1 (Promega) containing the PRT1 gene as a 3000-base pair long HindIII restriction fragment (16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was cleaved with the restriction enzymes SacI and KpnI, and the SacI/KpnI restriction fragment was separated from the vector by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector was then ligated to a SacI/KpnI DNA fragment on which the PRT1 open reading frame starts with the AUG at position 490 (numbering of (16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the 5′ primer 5′-CCGAGCTCAGATCTAAGGAGATAATTCAAATGACT-3′ (SacI site underlined, initiator codon in boldface) and the 3′ primer 5′-AAATAGGTACCCTTTGGGG-3′ (KpnI site underlined). From this plasmid the entire PRT1 open reading frame was excised by digestion with SacI and HindIII and inserted behind the yeast GAL1/10 promoter in the shuttle vector K10. This plasmid was amplified in E. coli and transformed into the yeast strain T92A (a,leu2,ura3,prt1-1).RESULTSPurification of the Prt1-containing Protein ComplexWe used a polyclonal rat anti-Prt1 antibody to identify and quantitate Prt1 protein by Western blotting during purification (see “Materials and Methods”). As starting material for the purification we chose the ribosomal salt wash fraction because pilot experiments had indicated that this fraction contained about 50% of the Prt1 protein but only a minor part of total cellular protein. Separation of the ribosomal wash fraction by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (see “Materials and Methods”) resulted in a roughly 20-fold purification and the recovery of about 5% of Prt1 protein (Table 1). Substantial loss of Prt1 protein occurred during phosphocellulose chromatography. We don't know the reason for this.Tabled 1The optical density profile of the sucrose gradient showed a major peak of fast sedimenting material in fractions 7-9 followed by multiple peaks of more slowly migrating components (Fig. 1A). Individual fractions of the sucrose gradient were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel revealed the copurification of five major polypeptides in fractions 7-9 (Fig. 1B, lanes3-6). They are most likely associated in a protein complex (see below). Two less abundant polypeptides (arrowhead and arrow in Fig. 1B) are probably not true subunits of the complex; the 50-kDa polypeptide (arrow) does not comigrate with the other polypeptides under the high salt concentration condition of the gradient but appears to migrate slower. The 116-kDa subunit (arrowhead) appears as a minor band after sucrose gradient centrifugation in this preparation (and not at all in another preparation, result not shown) but becomes more prominent upon further purification (compare Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). This indicates that it may be a proteolytic digestion product of the largest polypeptide. The main polypeptides have apparent molecular masses of about 130, 80, 75, 40, and 32 kDa. The 75-kDa polypeptide is the Prt1 protein as judged from its reaction with the polyclonal rat anti-Prt1 antibody (Fig. 1C). The vast majority of Prt1 protein comigrates with the complex, and we estimate the protein complex to be at least 70% pure after sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1B).Figure 1:SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of sucrose density gradient fractions.

Two main bands (arrow and arrowhead) and several minor bands were observed under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2A, lane2). We cut the main bands individually out of the gel and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 2B, lane3) and with silver (Fig. 2B, lane4). Both produced the same band pattern; we obtained the five main bands discussed in Fig. 1B. Protein blotting verified that the 75-kDa band in the complex after non-denaturing gel electrophoresis is Prt1 protein (not shown). These findings support our observation that the 130-, 80-, 40-, and 32-kDa polypeptides form a stable protein complex with Prt1 protein.The Prt1-containing Protein Complex Is a Translation FactorCell-free translation systems derived from prt1-1 strains (strain P501-1 in this study) are defective in translation initiation when the cells are incubated at 37°C (13Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or when the extract from cells grown at a lower temperature is preincubated at 37°C(17Mandel T. Trachsel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We tested our Prt1-containing protein complex for biological activity in a cell-free system derived from strain P501-1 (Fig. 3). Preincubation of this extract at 37°C for 5 min results in very low methionine incorporation in the absence of mRNA or with total yeast RNA as mRNA (Fig. 3B). Addition of sucrose gradient-purified Prt1-containing protein complex (100 (0.28 pmol) or 200 ng (0.56 pmol)) stimulates translation 8-12-fold (Fig. 3B), whereas the same protein fraction stimulates translation in an untreated extract (kept at low temperature) only 1.5-3-fold (Fig. 3A). Apparently, the endogenous temperature-sensitive Prt1 protein can be inactivated by preincubation at 37°C, and Prt1 activity can be restored by addition of Prt1-containing protein complex. The stimulation of untreated extract by Prt1-containing protein complex varied somewhat between no stimulation and 2-3-fold stimulation.Figure 3:In vitro translation. Extract of strain P501-1 was treated with micrococcal nuclease and either kept at 0°C (A) or incubated at 37°C for 5 min (B) before the addition of [35S]methionine (4 μCi/reaction). Where indicated, 5 μg of total yeast RNA was added as mRNA. Incubation mixtures (12 μl of total volume) were incubated at 25°C, and 4-μl aliquots were assayed for methionine incorporation into protein.

McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was pertinent to test whether Prt1-containing protein complex is able to stimulate this reaction. We incubated preheated P501-1 extracts under translation conditions for 5 min and fractionated them on sucrose density gradients. A dose-dependent stimulation of methionine binding to ribosomes was obtained (Fig. 4). Since the extract was analyzed under translation conditions the subunit-joining reaction converted most of the 40 S•Met-tRNAi complexes into 80 S initiation complexes.Figure 4:Methionine binding to ribosomes. Extract of strain P501-1 was treated as described for Fig. 3, heated for 5 min at 37°C, and supplied with [35S]methionine (5 μCi/reaction). Incubation mixtures (12 μl, about 5 pmol of ribosomes) were incubated at 25°C for 5 min, diluted with 38 μl of dilution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2), and layered onto 4 ml of 5-30% sucrose density gradients in dilution buffer.

Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only 9 nucleotides upstream of the second AUG codon. This would result in the synthesis of a polypeptide chain of 82.7 kDa molecular mass. This is closer to the molecular mass of the Prt1 band we identify by Western blotting in our protein complex than the molecular mass (88.1 kDa) originally proposed(16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To find out whether Prt1 protein starting with the methionine encoded by the second AUG (position +490) is functional in vivo we expressed this protein under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter in the temperature-sensitive strain T92A (see “Materials and Methods”). Cells carrying the construct encoding Prt1 protein but not cells transformed with the vector alone were able to grow at 37°C (Fig. 5). This shows that Prt1 protein starting with methionine encoded by the second AUG codon (position +490 in the sequence of Hanic-Joyce et al.(16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is active in vivo.Figure 5:Growth of yeast transformants at 37°C.

Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has therefore a molecular mass of 82.7 kDa. This is supported by (a) the S1 nuclease digestion experiments of Keierleber et al.(15Keierleber C. Wittekind M. Qin S. McLaughlin C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), (b) the finding that the polypeptide starting with methionine encoded by the AUG at position +490 is active in vivo (Fig. 5), and (c) the apparent molecular weight of Prt1 protein on SDS gels (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Prt1 is a subunit of a protein complex, which is stable under conditions of high salt concentration on sucrose density gradients (Fig. 1) and during non-denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The abundance of the Prt1-containing protein complex in yeast cells was estimated to be about 0.2 copies/ribosome. This estimation is based on our recovery of protein complex during purification and the determination of the ribosome concentration by absorption at 260 nm after the high salt washing step. Since Prt1 protein is stably integrated in the protein complex and active in the restoration of translation in an extract in which endogenous Prt1 has been inactivated, we assume that Prt1 protein is active as a subunit of the protein complex.Our data support (but do not prove) the earlier claim (14Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. NATO ASI Ser. 1988; 14: 271-281Google Scholar) that Prt1 is a subunit of the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF-3: (a) the purification scheme for Prt1 described in this work is very similar to the one used earlier by Trachsel et al.(24Trachsel H. Erni B. Schreier M.H. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) to purify the mammalian factor; (b) the protein complex is a translation factor as shown previously (12Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. NATO ASI Ser. 1988; 14: 271-281Google Scholar) and in Figure 3:, Figure 4: of this work; and (c) like eIF-3, the Prt1-containing protein complex has RNA binding activity. The latter was shown by incubating the Prt1-containing protein complex with capped and uncapped (in vitro transcribed) RNA of 227 nucleotides in length containing an AUG translation initiation codon and measuring RNA-protein complex formation by filtration through a nitrocellulose filter. In this assay the Prt1-containing protein complex retains RNA on the filter (results not shown).The Prt1-containing protein complex has fewer subunits and a lower molecular weight than mammalian eIF-3. The estimated molecular mass (340 kDa) is in agreement with data from Cigan et al.(25Cigan M.A. Foiani M. Hannig M.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3217-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) showing that Prt1 is in a complex, which has a similar sedimentation behavior in glycerol gradients like yeast eIF-2B whose molecular mass is estimated to be 300 kDa(26Cigan M.A. Bushman J.L. Boal T.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5350-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the possibility that the Prt1-containing protein complex contains additional subunits and that we lose these proteins during purification. Such proteins could reassociate with our purified complex in the in vitro translation system and restore active factor.Based on our findings we believe that the Prt1-containing protein complex very likely represents the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF-3. The isolation of eIF-3 from the yeast S. cerevisiae is an important step toward the elucidation of the functions of this complex factor in translation initiation in eukaryotes. INTRODUCTIONTranslation initiation is a multistep pathway, which positions an 80 S ribosome with bound initiator Met-tRNAi at the initiator AUG codon of an open reading frame on mRNA(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the main initiation pathway is cap-dependent; ribosomes bind near the cap structure m7GpppN at the 5′ end of mRNA and then scan the mRNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction until they encounter an initiator AUG codon(3Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). These reactions are catalyzed by a large number of polypeptides, the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Experiments with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that translation initiation in this lower eukaryote strongly resembles cap-dependent initiation in mammals(4Müller P.P. Trachsel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Linder P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar). This is perhaps most convincingly demonstrated by the finding that some mammalian initiation factors can substitute for yeast factors in vivo(7Altmann M. Müller P.P. Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12145-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schwelberger H.G. Kang H.A. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14018-14025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of yeast cell-free translation systems (9Gasior E. Herrera F. Sadnik I. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3965-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tuite M.F. Plesset J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and powerful genetic approaches make this system an attractive model system to study the mechanism and regulation of translation in eukaryotes.Most of the translation initiation factors identified earlier in the mammalian system have also been isolated and their genes cloned from S. cerevisiae(4Müller P.P. Trachsel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Linder P. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1992; 62: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, yeast initiation factors were identified and their genes cloned whose mammalian homologues are not yet known(6Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 69-86Crossref Google Scholar, 11Hinnebusch A.G. Wek R.C. Dever T.E. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 87-115Crossref Google Scholar).Among the few initiation factors that have not yet been isolated from yeast is the factor eIF-3. Mammalian eIF-3 is composed of eight polypeptide chains with a total mass of about 550 kDa(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 2Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution experiments showed that this factor is involved in several consecutive steps in the initiation pathway including ribosome dissociation, Met-tRNAi binding to 40 S ribosomes, and mRNA binding to 40 S•Met-tRNAi complexes(1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar).The analysis of the yeast mutant strain prt1-1 originally isolated by Hartwell (12Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Prt1 protein stimulates the interaction of the ternary complex eIF-2•GTP•Met-tRNAi with the 40 S ribosomal subunit(13Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings and unpublished data, 2K. Moldave and C. S. McLaughlin, unpublished data. Moldave and McLaughlin (14Moldave K. McLaughlin C.S. NATO ASI Ser. 1988; 14: 271-281Google Scholar) suggested that the PRT1 gene may encode a subunit of eIF-3. The cloning of the PRT1 gene (15Keierleber C. Wittekind M. Qin S. McLaughlin C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Hanic-Joyce P.J. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2845-2851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the development of a cell-free system in which Prt1 activity can be measured (17Mandel T. Trachsel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1007: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) allowed attempts to purify Prt1. Here, we show that Prt1 is a subunit of a protein complex that may be the yeast homologue of mammalian eIF-3."
https://openalex.org/W2069862519,"We have characterized the <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of the proto-oncogenic RAC protein kinase (DRAC-PK). The DRAC-PK gene gives rise to two transcripts with the same coding potential, generated by the use of two different polyadenylation signals. Each transcript encodes two polypeptides because of the presence of a weaker initiator ACG codon, upstream from the major AUG, such that the larger protein contains an N-terminal extension. Like the human isoforms, DRAC-PKs possess a novel signaling region, the pleckstrin homology domain. DRAC-PK proteins have a similar expression pattern, being regulated both maternally and zygotically, and are expressed throughout <i>Drosophila</i> development. Antisera specific for recombinant DRAC-PK and for its C terminus detected two polypeptides of 66 and 85 kDa in <i>Drosophila</i> extracts. The antirecombinant antisera also recognized a polypeptide of 120 kDa from <i>Drosophila</i>, which apparently shared an epitope related to DRAC-PK sequences. The role of p120 appears to be restricted compared with that of DRAC-PK, since it was not detected in larvae or adult flies. There was no spatial restriction of DRAC-PK expression during embryogenesis, suggesting that localized activation might be a regulatory mechanism for its function. DRAC-PK possesses an intrinsic kinase activity that is ∼8-fold higher in adult flies than in 0-3-h embryos undergoing rapid mitotic cycles."
https://openalex.org/W1513138125,"The key event in receptor-catalyzed activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is binding of GTP, which leads to subunit dissociation generating GTP-bound alpha subunits and free beta complexes. We have previously identified a mutation that abolished GTP binding in Galpha(o) (S47C) and demonstrated that the mutant retained the ability to bind beta and could act in a dominant negative fashion when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Slepak, V. Z., Quick, M. W., Aragay, A. M., Davidson, N., Lester, H. A., and Simon, M. I.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21889-21894). In the current work, we investigated the effects of the homologous mutant of Galpha (S48C) upon signaling pathways reconstituted in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. We found that expression of the Galpha S48C mutant prevented stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) beta2 by free beta subunit complexes. This effect of Galpha(i) S48C was not readily reversible in contrast to the inhibitory effect of wild-type Galpha, which could be reversed upon activation of the cotransfected muscarinic M2 receptor, presumably by release of beta from the G protein heterotrimer. Coexpression of Galpha(i) S48C or the wild-type Galpha also dramatically decreased G-mediated stimulation of PLC by C5a in the cells transfected with cDNAs encoding C5a receptor and Galpha. Activation of PLC via endogenous G(q) or G in the presence of alpha1C adrenergic receptors was similarly attenuated by coexpression of Galpha(i) or Galpha(i) S48C. Pertussis toxin treatment of the transfected cells enhanced the inhibition of the receptor-stimulated PLC by wild-type Galpha(i) subunits but did not influence the effects of the dominant negative mutant. The enhancement of the wild-type Galpha(i) inhibitory effect by pertussis toxin can be explained by stabilization of Galpha(i) binding to beta as a result of ADP-ribosylation, while Galpha(i) S48C mutant binds beta irreversibly even without pertussis toxin treatment. Therefore, a feasible mechanism to rationalize the attenuation of the Galpha and G-mediated activation of PLC by cotransfected Galpha(i) is the competition between Galpha(i) and Galpha or G for the beta complexes, which are necessary for the G protein coupling with receptors. These experiments provide new evidence for the role of beta in the integration of signals controlling phosphoinositide release through different Galpha families."

https://openalex.org/W1971246384,"Effects of changes in oxidation state at the other metal centers on oxidized heme a3 cyanide of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase have been investigated. Only one CN- binds, giving Fe3+a3CN, in fully-oxidized cytochrome c oxidase and its 1-, 2-, and 3-electron reduction products. Soret/visible spectra for the heme a3 cyanide are independent of overall redox level, whereas distinct shifts in C-N infrared stretch band frequency occur upon reduction, reflecting changes in the polarity of the ligand (CN-) environment. Catalysis of O2 reduction can be critically dependent upon such changes in polarity at the reduction site. These findings indicate that CuB, when reduced, exists in two forms whose relative stabilities are independent of Fea and CuA oxidation states and, when oxidized, is in only one stable form. These results are consistent with the oxidation of Cu+B triggering proton pumping and with the involvement of a CuB ligand in respiratory control. Electron equivalents introduced into the enzyme are distributed equally among Fea, CuA, and CuB, which raises the possibility that all four electrons used in O2 reduction are donated via Cu+B, which is favorably positioned with respect to Fea3 (the O2 binding site) in order to carry out this role in electron transfers."
https://openalex.org/W2013104295,"Clavaminate synthase is an Fe(2+)-, O2-, and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes three transformations in the biosynthesis of the important beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. The genes from Streptomyces clavuligerus encoding two isoenzymes of clavaminate synthase have been over-expressed in Escherichia coli to give soluble proteins whose reactions, kinetic properties, and molecular masses are in excellent agreement with the wild-type isozymes. Preliminary investigation of the active site of clavaminate synthase was undertaken using diethyl pyrocarbonate and N-ethylmaleimide. Each was inhibitory to catalytic activity. Protection from inactivation in the presence of these reagents by Fe2+, O2, and alpha-ketoglutaric acid was thwarted by the rapid self-inactivation of the enzyme in the absence of substrate. However, protection was achieved when Co2+, a potent competitive inhibitor of clavaminate synthase 2 with respect to Fe2+, was substituted. This is consistent with the presence of histidine and cysteine, respectively, at or near the active site and possibly involved in iron binding. In the course of constructing the expression vector, a simply applied general error analysis of the polymerase chain reaction was formulated to calculate the proportion of correctly replicated DNA and guide the design of experiments using this method."

Whether preferred combinations of isoforms combine to form a more limited number of distinct complexes is not clear(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Regardless, G protein-coupled receptors seem to require heterotrimers containing specific α, β, and γ subunit isoforms(17Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 18Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B.

Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, receptor regulation of G protein function must be strongly influenced by how heterotrimer composition is determined. We have separated bovine brain G protein heterotrimers based upon their constituent α subunits and then determined their γ subunit composition using isoform-specific antibodies(12Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All of the purified G proteins contained a heterogeneous mixture of γ subunits, suggesting a great diversity of the number of possible heterotrimer combinations. However, for the major brain G protein, GO(21Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Neer E.J. Lok J.M. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the γ subunit composition varied between αO splice variants and between αO subunits thought to differ because of post-translational modifications. These results support the idea of specific α and γ subunit associations (23Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that both subunits are important to define a heterotrimer. Furthermore, the exact subunit composition of G protein heterotrimers may depend both upon regulated expression of different subunit isoforms and upon cellular processing of α subunits. Affi-Gel-5 and Affi-Gel-102 were from Bio-Rad, and sulfo-MBS 2The abbreviations used are: sulfo-MBSm-maleimidobenzoylN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide esterTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineFPLCfast protein liquid chromatographyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). was from Pierce. The γ subunits were resolved on a 10-20% gradient gel using a Tricine buffer system(24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by either Coomassie Blue or silver staining(25Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1961; 118: 197-203Crossref Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). The staining intensities of protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were measured as described (26Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Kohnken R.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using an Omnimedia XRS scanner with Image analysis software (National Institutes of Health).

Bovine brain G proteins were prepared according to Sternweis and Robishaw(21Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications by Kohnken and Hildebrandt(27Kohnken R.E. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20688-20696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture of heterotrimers was separated on an HR 5/5 MonoQ FPLC column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). G protein (10 mg) was loaded onto the MonoQ column and eluted over 60 min at 1.0 ml/min with a linear gradient of 100-200 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Thesit, 0.7% CHAPS, pH 8.0. Peak fractions of each G protein heterotrimer were pooled and passed one or more (for Gi2) times over the MonoQ column. GOA and GOC were resolved into their α subunits and βγ dimers using previously described procedures implemented on an FPLC column(26Dingus J. Wilcox M.D. Kohnken R.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 457-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Kohnken R.E. Hildebrandt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20688-20696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pooled purified proteins were concentrated and exchanged into 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Thesit, 100 mM NaCl using an Amicon concentrator with a YM-10 membrane. Immunoblotting for γ subunit isoforms was carried out following a high temperature transfer procedure (28Robishaw J. Balcueva E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and isotype-specific antisera (20Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as described previously. Bound antibodies on immunoblots for the γ subunits were visualized using a 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragment. Isoform-specific α subunit antisera were raised to the sequences NTYEDAAAY(C) (antiserum AO1, residues 295-303 of αO), KNNLKDCGLF (antiserum AI12, COOH-terminal residues of αi2 and αi2), and GNLQIDFADPQR (antiserum AI2L, residues 89-100 of αi2). Peptides AI12 and AI2L were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde(29Gierschik P. Codina J. Simons C. Birnbaumer L. Spiegel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and peptide AO1 was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using sulfo-MBS(30Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Antisera to the coupled peptides were raised in rabbits according to Green et al.(30Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The αO antibody, recognizing the sequence NLKEDGISAAKDVK (residues 22-35) common to all αO isoforms(31Kroll S.D.

Anti-α antibodies were affinity-purified using peptide immobilized on Affi-Gel-15 (AI12 and AI2L) or on Affi-Gel-102 treated with sulfo-MBS (AO1). Bound antibodies were eluted either with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, 0.5 M NaCl neutralized with 2 M ammonium bicarbonate (AO1 and AI12) or with ActiSep elution medium (AI2L) from Sterogene (Arcadia, CA). Immunoblotting for α subunits followed the methods of Towbin et al.(32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). Bound antibody was visualized using the ECL reagents from Amersham Corp. Chromatography of mixed G protein preparations on a MonoQ FPLC column (Fig. 1B) resolved heterotrimers containing three distinct α subunits of 39, 41, and 40 kDa (Fig. 1A), corresponding to the α subunits of GO, Gi1, and Gi2, respectively (33Goldsmith P.

When the fractionated G proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, scanning densitometry of the α subunit bands showed that GOα could be resolved into three distinct peaks (Fig. 1C). The first two peaks were the GOB and GOA isoforms(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T.

Kaziro Y. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 3All mammals are thought to express at least two αO proteins derived from alternatively spliced mRNAs from a single gene(37Price S.R.

Biol. 1991; 11: 1146-1155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mRNAs are often referred to as αO and αO2. The two αO proteins are identical in their first 240 residues and 80% homologous in their COOH-terminal 114 residues. Complete cDNA sequences have been reported for both transcripts in many species, but a bovine sequence has been reported only for αO(39Van Meurs K.P. Angus C.W. Lavu S. Kung H.F. Czarnecki S.K. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 49Ovchinnikov Y.A. Slepak V.Z. Pronin A.N. Shlensky A.B. Levina N.B. Voeikov V.L. Lipkin V.M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 226: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Sequencing of peptides from bovine αOB indicates that it is homologous to the αO2 transcript found in other species(38Shibasaki H. Kozasa T. Takahashi K. Inanobe A. Kaziro Y. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, antibodies specific for the most unique sequence in rat αO2 do not recognize bovine αOB(50Spicher K. Klinz F.J. Rudolph U. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 51Asano T. Morishita R. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting species variation in this site. Thus, although it is clear that bovine αOA and αOB are splice variants compatible with the αO and αO2 variants in other species, their exact relationship has not yet been determined. The third GO peak was apparently the same heterotrimer referred to as GO4 by Katada and co-workers(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Kobayashi I. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kikkawa S. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For consistency with past publications(35Carty D.J. Padrell E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6268-6273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Padrell E. Carty D.J. Moriarty T.M. Hildebrandt J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is referred to here as GOC. One or more additional FPLC steps were required to isolate each of five distinct G protein heterotrimers corresponding to Gi1, Gi2, GOA, GOB, and GOC (Fig. 2A). These assignments were confirmed by immunoblotting with α subunit-specific antibodies (Fig. 3). GOAα and GOCα were both recognized by antibodies specific for an αO sequence (39Van Meurs K.P. Angus C.W. Lavu S. Kung H.F. Czarnecki S.K. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3107-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This agrees with the conclusion of Shibasaki et al.(38Shibasaki H. Kozasa T. Takahashi K. Inanobe A. Kaziro Y. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that GOAα and GOCα are both translated from the same α splice variant. Silver-stained gels (Fig. 2A) and immunoblots (Fig. 2B) revealed minor cross-contamination of the G protein heterotrimers, particularly Gi2 and GOC. Nevertheless, each G protein was at least 80% pure. GOA, GOB, and Gi1 were nearly homogeneous. The stoichiometry of GTPγS binding to the purified heterotrimers was 0.9:1 (assuming an Mr of 80,000) for all of the isoforms except Gi2, which was 0.8:1. These data suggest that these proteins are purified as intact viable heterotrimers.Figure 3:Analysis of G isoform preparations using antibodies against specific α isoforms. Purified G protein isoforms (1 μg) were separated on 13% acrylamide, 0.4% bisacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with antibodies with the indicated specificity for α isoforms (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The G protein heterotrimers described above were separated based upon their α subunit composition. Their associated γ subunit isoforms were analyzed using two different techniques. The first was analysis by electrophoresis on Tricine gels(24Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar), which resolved the γ subunits into three discrete bands (Fig. 2B). These three bands, from top to bottom, are thought to correspond to γ3, γ2, and a combination of γ7 and γ5(40Ueda N. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lee E. Smrcka A.V. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4388-4395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second technique was analysis by immunoblotting (Fig. 4) using γ isoform-specific antibodies generated to unique sequences in four γ subunits thought to be present in brain(12Cali J.J. Balcueva E.A. Rybalkin I. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24023-24027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Robishaw J.D. Balcueva E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 498-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Analysis of these data is complicated by the fact that there are several additional incompletely characterized γ subunits.1 Nevertheless, from these data, we can draw important conclusions that are only reinforced by the recognition of additional G protein subunit heterogeneity. Both techniques verified the observation that G protein heterotrimers, defined by their α subunits, contain multiple γ subunit isoforms and hence multiple combinations of βγ dimers(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gi1 and Gi2 had very similar γ subunit compositions that were not substantially different from that of GOA. Although interesting and potentially important, this conclusion may have to be refined as γ subunit heterogeneity is further characterized. In addition, such nonspecific association of subunits could have resulted from random recombination of the subunits during the isolation of the heterotrimers. Surprisingly, the three GO isoforms had different γ subunit profiles (Fig. 4). For example, GOA had considerably more γ2 than did GOB or GOC. Even more striking was the minimal amount of γ7 in GOC and the virtual absence of γ5 in GOB. In contrast, the contribution of β1 and β2 to each of the different heterotrimers was the same (data not shown). These results cannot be explained by random association of α subunits with βγ dimers, either in vivo or during G protein purification. The α/γ associations reported above were highly reproducible, and identical results were seen in three separate heterotrimer preparations. The only exception to this was the distribution of γ3 among the G proteins. In particular, the amount of γ3 in GOB could vary a great deal from that shown in Fig. 4, where there is less γ3 in GOB than in GOA. In another preparation, GOB had much more γ3 than any of the other heterotrimers. Two previous studies using gel electrophoretic behavior (15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) appear to report conflicting results for the amounts of γ3 associated with GOB. The difference between those two studies is similar to the variability seen by us here (Fig. 4). The significance of these observations is not entirely clear, but is likely related to the fact that free γ3 subunits can be found dissociated from β subunits(41Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A reasonable explanation for our results and those of others (15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is that the association of γ3 with β is labile and results in its variable recovery with different G proteins, particularly GOB. GOAα and GOBα are thought to be products of two splice variants of a single GOα gene(37Price S.R. Murtagh Jr., J.J. Tsuchiya M. Serventi I.M. Van Meurs K.P. Angus C.W. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5069-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 38Shibasaki H. Kozasa T. Takahashi K. Inanobe A. Kaziro Y. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), referred to as αO and αO2, respectively(42Hsu W.H. Rudolph U. Sanford J. Bertrand P. Olate J. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Boyd A.E. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11220-11226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Strathmann M. Wilkie T.M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6477-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The different γ subunit combinations observed with these two α isoforms could result from coordinated expression of α and γ in different tissues or cells or from preferences of α for particular βγ isoforms during heterotrimer formation. In either case, both the α and γ subunit compositions of heterotrimers define the intact G protein. Recent evidence for direct binding of the γ subunit to α (23Rahmatullah M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3574-3580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the idea that heterotrimers are made up of specific subunit combinations. Since αO and αO2 are thought to have identical NH2-terminal sequences likely to be involved in α binding to βγ(44Neer E.J. Pulsifer L. Wolf L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8996-9000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their different γ subunit preferences could suggest an additional region of subunit interactions near the COOH terminus. Alternatively, different post-translational modifications of αO splice variants at their NH2 termini could also explain their different γ subunit preferences. GOA and GOC were separated by us (Fig. 1) and by others (15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 34Kobayashi I. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kikkawa S. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) based upon their differing behavior on a MonoQ column. Antibody and proteolytic peptide mapping data suggest that GOAα and GOCα come from the same αO mRNA(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 38Shibasaki H. Kozasa T. Takahashi K. Inanobe A. Kaziro Y. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and our results agree with this conclusion (Fig. 3). However, since GOA and GOC differ in their γ subunit composition (Fig. 4), it is possible that their α subunits are in fact identical and that their different elution during MonoQ chromatography is due solely to their different βγ dimer compositions. To test this possibility, αOA and αi1 were separated from their βγ dimers and individually examined on a MonoQ column (Fig. 5). The position of the protein in each case was determined by GTPγS binding activity and immunoreactivity with an αO-specific antibody (AO1). αi1 eluted as a single major peak with a shoulder probably indicative of some contamination with αi2. Interestingly, αOA eluted as two fairly sharp peaks in two of three preparations, suggesting additional αOA heterogeneity. Regardless, the two isolated α subunits, αOA and αi1, still eluted differently on the MonoQ column. Thus, not only are the βγ dimers of GOA and GOC different, but their α subunits differ as well. Although these results do not exclude the possibility that αOA and αi1 are internal splice variants of the αO gene, existing evidence suggests that they have the same coding sequence. Four mRNAs have been shown to be generated from the bovine αO gene(45Murtagh J.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 5: 842-849Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One corresponds to αO2 and would generate αOB. The other three differ in their 3′-untranslated regions, but code for identical αO proteins. Presumably, αOA and αi1 are derived from these three mRNAs. This suggests that they are proteins with the same sequence, but different post-translational modifications. As discussed above, the different patterns of γ subunit expression observed with GOA and GOC could result from different preferences of α subunits for specific βγ dimers. The variable interaction of γ isoforms with α subunits (46Rahmatullah M. Ginnan R. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2946-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) might support such a conclusion. Alternatively, our results could be explained by the regulated coexpression of α and γ subunit isoforms in different cells, or perhaps even the same cell. This could be related to the multiple transcripts coding for the αO protein(45Murtagh J.J. Moss J. Vaughan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 5: 842-849Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to define the relative contributions of these two possibilities. Immunocytochemistry with site-specific antibodies and in situ hybridization determining the expression of variable α and γ subunit proteins and transcripts will be important to resolve the possible colocalization of these proteins. Complementary biochemical studies of the GO isoforms will help determine the preferential interaction of α subunits with βγ dimers and the functional significance of these unique heterotrimer combinations. Muscarinic and somatostatin receptors are thought to couple specifically to the αOβ3γ4 and αO2β1γ3 heterotrimers, respectively, in their regulation of Ca2+ channels in GH3 cells(17Kleuss C. Hescheler J. Ewel C. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1991; 353: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 18Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B.

Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These results suggest exquisite specificity in the recognition of G protein heterotrimers by receptors. It remains unclear whether specific G protein subunit combinations occur randomly or if there are mechanisms that dictate the composition of heterotrimers. Such mechanisms would have great significance for the regulation of cellular function by G protein-coupled receptors. More important, in addition to the previously reported heterogeneity in α/γ subunit associations(15Inanobe A. Shibasaki H. Takahashi K. Kobayashi I. Tomita U. Ui M. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), our results indicate that these subunits do exist in preferred combinations. This is not only true for the association of γ isoforms with splice variants of a single α subunit, such as αOA and αOB, but also for α subunits that may differ only by their post-translational modifications, which may be the case for αOA and αi1. The nature of the putative modifications that distinguish these proteins is not yet known; however, many potential modifications, such as palmitoylation, carboxymethylation, and phosphorylation, are reversible and regulatable. Thus, it may be possible that cellular regulation of the modification of G protein subunits could ultimately affect the composition of G protein heterotrimers and direct their subsequent receptor and effector interactions.

https://openalex.org/W1971763515,"Human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) consists of a family of five evolutionarily related classes of enzymes that collectively function in the metabolism of a wide variety of alcohols including ethanol and retinol. Class IV ADH has been found to be the most active as a retinol dehydrogenase, thus it may participate in retinoic acid synthesis. The gene encoding class IV ADH (ADH7) has now been cloned and subjected to molecular examination. Southern blot analysis indicated that class IV ADH is encoded by a single unique gene and has no related pseudogenes. The class IV ADH gene is divided into nine exons, consistent with the highly conserved intron/exon structure of other mammalian ADH genes. The predicted amino acid sequence of the exon coding regions indicates that a protein of 373 amino acids, excluding the amino-terminal methionine, would be translated, sharing greater sequence identity with class I ADH (69%) than with classes II, III, or V (59-61%). Expression of class IV ADH mRNA was detected in human stomach but not liver. This correlates with previous protein studies, which have indicated that class IV ADH is the major stomach ADH but unlike other ADHs is absent from liver. Primer extension studies using human stomach RNA were performed to identify the transcription initiation site lying 100 base pairs upstream of the ATG translation start codon. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the promoter region indicated the absence of a TATA box sequence often located about 25 base pairs upstream of the start site as well as the absence of GC boxes, which are quite often seen in promoters lacking a TATA box. The class IV ADH promoter thus differs from the other ADH promoters, which contain either a TATA box (classes I and II) or GC-boxes (class III), suggesting a fundamentally different form of transcriptional regulation.

Vertebrate alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) (ADH) 1The abbreviations used are: ADHalcohol dehydrogenaseADHhuman gene encoding ADHbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. exists as a family of enzymes divided into several classes. Five classes of ADH have been identified in humans including class I ADH, the typical liver ADH, which efficiently oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde and is responsible for most of the ethanol metabolism (Jörnvall et al., 1993). The complete amino acid sequences of all five classes of human ADH have revealed sequence identites ranging from 57 to 69% (Satre et al., 1994). The evolutionary progenitor of all vertebrate ADH classes (as well as all other ADHs found in other organisms) has been found to be class III ADH, which exists ubiquitously in all organisms analyzed (Danielsson and Jörnvall, 1992; Danielsson et al., 1994). Class III ADH does not function in ethanol metabolism but instead acts as a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase needed to remove formaldehyde normally produced by some metabolic reactions (Koivusalo et al., 1989). Gene duplications from an ancestral class III ADH gene and subsequent mutational divergence have evidently given rise to several ADHs with enzymatic functions other than formaldehyde metabolism such as ethanol and retinol metabolism. alcohol dehydrogenase human gene encoding ADH base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) polymerase chain reaction CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. The ability of ADH to act as a retinol dehydrogenase (Boleda et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1994) implies that it may participate in the synthesis of retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A involved in regulating epithelial cell differentiation (Connor, 1988; De Luca, 1991). Retinoic acid is derived from retinol via two oxidation steps with retinal as the intermediate (Connor and Smit, 1987; Kim et al., 1992). Of the various classes of human ADH examined for retinol dehydrogenase activity in vitro, class IV ADH has been found to have the highest efficiency, with less activity attributed to ADH classes I and II, and no activity for class III (Yang et al., 1994). The inefficiency of class IV ADH in ethanol oxidation (Moreno and Parés, 1991; Stone et al., 1993) further suggests it has evolved to perform a role in the metabolism of other alcohols such as retinol. In addition to the forms of ADH that may function as cytosolic retinol dehydrogenases, a microsomal retinol dehydrogenase distinct from ADH has also been identified that can oxidize retinol in vitro (Posch et al., 1991). The relative importance of these various retinol dehydrogenases in vivo remains to be determined. In order to learn more about class IV ADH, we have initiated molecular genetic studies. A cDNA encoding human class IV ADH has been previously described (Satre et al., 1994). We have now analyzed genomic clones encoding the class IV ADH gene, which we refer to as ADH7. The intron/exon structure was determined, and the promoter region was identified. We also show that the class IV ADH gene, unlike other ADH genes, is expressed much higher in the stomach than in the liver. A partial cDNA for human class IV ADH described previously (Satre et al., 1994) was used to screen a human genomic DNA library prepared in λEMBL3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) by the plaque lift technique described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). This human class IV ADH cDNA fragment, a 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment derived from pMS7, was gel-purified and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP by random hexamer-primed labeling using the oligolabeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Hybridization of nitrocellulose filters was carried out for 20 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.6), 1% SDS, 10 μg/μl poly(A), 250 μg/μl heat-denatured herring sperm DNA, and 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled probe. Final washing was at 68°C for 1 h in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. After three rounds of plaque purification, phage DNA was prepared using the CsCl gradient method (Sambrook et al., 1989). Purified phage DNA was subjected to restriction mapping and Southern blotting by standard single and double enzyme digests (Sambrook et al., 1989), and further restriction mapping was accomplished by partial enzyme digestion using the λ mapping system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Genomic insert DNA fragments were released with SalI + KpnI or BamHI and subcloned into the plasmid Bluescript II KS (Stratagene) for further restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis. Southern blotting hybridization conditions were as described above and was performed with a class IV ADH cDNA probe radiolabeled as described above or with oligonucleotide probes labeled on the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). Human genomic DNA used for Southern blot analysis was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Sequence information from the 3′ end of the human class IV ADH genomic DNA insert in λMZ9 was used to generate an upstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer (GD-135) 5′-GTCGAAGGATCCCAATGTTGTGTCTTGTCTCCAC-3′ located on the coding strand in intron 8 about 1.2 kb downstream of exon 8. Sequence information from the 3′-untranslated region of the partial human class IV ADH cDNA (Satre et al., 1994) was used to design a downstream PCR primer (GD-134) 5′-TGCTAGAAGCTTGGGAACTCTCACAAGAGAAAC-3′ whose 3′ end is located on the noncoding strand 44 bp downstream of the stop codon. The conditions for PCR were a modification of the standard methodology (Ausubel et al., 1989). PCR reactions (50 μl) contained 0.5 mM of each nucleotide (dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP), 1 × reaction buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl], 2 units of Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 pmol of both upstream and downstream primers described above, and 1.0 μg of human genomic DNA (Clontech, Inc.), which had been previously heat-denatured at 95°C for 10 min. The reaction was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil and then subjected to 35 cycles of PCR. Cycling conditions were 93°C (60 s) for denaturation, 56°C (60 s) for annealing, and 72°C (60 s) for elongation. The sample was extracted once with chloroform to remove mineral oil and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and HindIII (sites engineered into the upstream and downstream primers, respectively, to generate sticky ends), and then cloned into Bluescript II KS for DNA sequence analysis. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1.0 μg of human stomach poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) using oligo(dT) as a primer and avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as described in the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen Corp.). The RNA sample was heat-denatured at 80°C for 5 min prior to reverse transcription. Oligonucleotide primers designed for PCR were based upon the sequences of the 5′-untranslated region of the human class IV ADH gene derived from the genomic clone λMZ5 described herein and from the 3′-untranslated region of the partial cDNA (Satre et al., 1994). The upstream PCR primer (GD-133) was 5′-GTCGAAGGATCCCAGATCCAAGACAAAGACAGG-3′, whose 3′ end is located on the coding strand 1 bp upstream of the start codon, and the downstream primer derived from the 3′-untranslated region was GD-134 described above. The conditions for PCR and cloning of the product were as described above except that the template was 1-5 μl of the above cDNA product, and the cycling conditions were 93°C (60 s) for denaturation, 52°C (60 s) for annealing, and 72°C (60 s) for elongation during the first 10 cycles; then 93°C (45 s), 55°C (50 s), and 72°C (45 s) during cycles 16-25; and finally 93°C (35 s), 56°C (45 s), and 72°C (45 s) during cycles 26-35. Double-stranded plasmid DNA derived from the genomic DNA and cDNA clones was subjected to dideoxynucleotide sequence analysis using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequences were determined on both strands. Sequencing of exons 1 and 2 present in clone λMZ5 was described previously (Satre et al., 1994). Exons 3-9 and adjacent intron sequences were similarly sequenced using exon-specific oligonucleotide primers based upon the sequence of the cDNA (Satre et al., 1994) to allow sequencing into the adjacent introns, and then intron-specific oligonucleotide primers were used to sequence across the exons. Computer analysis of nucleotide sequences was accomplished using the MacVector version 4 program (International Biotechnologies, Inc.). Samples (0.5 μg) of human stomach and liver poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech, Inc.) were separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). Samples (10 μg) of total mouse liver RNA containing 18 S RNA (1.87 kb) and 28 S RNA (4.72 kb) were also loaded to estimate molecular sizes. The radiolabeling of the cDNA probes and hybridization conditions were as described above for screening of the genomic library. The hybridization probes included the human class IV ADH cDNA described previously (Satre et al., 1994) and a cDNA for the human class I ADH gene ADH3 described previously (Höög et al., 1986). A 1.0-μg sample of human stomach poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech, Inc.) was subjected to primer extension using avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and the following modifications of the conditions described for first strand cDNA synthesis in the cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen Corp.). (a) The RNA sample was incubated at 80°C for 5 min prior to use. (b) The radiolabeled nucleotide [α-32P]dCTP replaced unlabeled dCTP, and (c) a specific primer was used (GD-108) consisting of the first 21 bp of noncoding strand sequence upstream of the ATG translation start codon in the human class IV ADH gene: 5′-CCTGTCTTTGTCTTGGATCTG-3′. For a marker, primer GD-108 was used in a DNA sequencing reaction of a plasmid containing the 5′-untranslated region of human class IV ADH. The reaction products were separated on a 6% sequencing gel as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). In order to determine the intron/exon arrangement and exon coding sequences for the human class IV ADH gene, we screened a human genomic DNA library to isolate the ADH7 gene. A total of 300,000 plaques were screened using a partial human class IV ADH cDNA as a probe (Satre et al., 1994). Two clones were isolated (λMZ5 and λMZ9), and restriction mapping indicated that they overlapped by 1.1 kb and contained most of the gene (Fig. 1). The λ genomic DNA clones were subjected to Southern blotting using oligonucleotide probes specific for various exons to locate these regions for DNA sequence analysis. DNA fragments released by SalI + KpnI or BamHI digestion were subcloned into pBluescript II KS for DNA sequence analysis. This analysis indicated that λMZ5 contained the 5′ end of the gene and that λMZ9 contained the 3′ end, but exon 9 containing the 3′-untranslated region was not included. Since a further screen of the library did not result in the isolation of a genomic clone containing this region, we used PCR technology for its cloning. A small amount of nucleotide sequence information obtained from the 3′ end of λMZ9 (inside intron 8 about 1.2 kb downstream of exon 8) was used to design an upstream PCR primer, while the previously determined 3′-untranslated sequence in the human class IV ADH cDNA (Satre et al., 1994) was used to design a downstream PCR primer. Using human genomic DNA as a template for PCR with the two above primers, we were able to generate a 1.2-kb DNA fragment containing exon 9 that was cloned into pBluescript II KS to generate pPCRexon9 (Fig. 1). The region from exons 1-9 of the human class IV ADH gene was thus found to span about 23 kb. Detailed sequence analysis of the genomic clones and comparison with the cDNA sequence indicated that the human class IV ADH gene was divided into 9 exons (Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequences of the exons and 3′-untranslated sequence from the human class IV ADH genomic clones matched perfectly with the previously determined cDNA sequence (Satre et al., 1994). Since this cDNA was incomplete (its 5′ end started at codon 8), we used PCR to clone the full-length coding region for class IV ADH. An upstream PCR primer was synthesized based upon the sequence of the 5′-untranslated region located in exon 1 in the genomic clone λMZ5, and a downstream primer was synthesized based upon the 3′-untranslated sequence lying just downstream of the stop codon in the partial cDNA. Since class IV ADH protein has been found to be most abundant in the stomach (Yin et al., 1990; Moreno and Parés, 1991), human stomach poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to reverse transcription and PCR with the above primers. The expected 1.2-kb PCR product was generated, cloned into pBluescript II KS, and sequenced. The sequence contained the entire coding region of human class IV ADH and matched perfectly with all nine exons in the genomic clones from position +80 in the 5′-untranslated region to position 64 of the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2). The sequence of the coding region of our full-length cDNA matches that described in two recent reports of full-length cDNAs for human class IV ADH (Farrés et al., 1994; Yokoyama et al., 1994). The sequences of all of the introns at the intron/exon junctions conformed to the GT/AG rule (Breathnach and Chambon, 1981). The positions at which the introns interrupted the coding region were identical to those observed in the other human ADH genes previously analyzed (Duester et al., 1986; Matsuo and Yokoyama, 1989; Von Bahr-Lindström et al., 1991; Yasunami et al., 1991; Hur and Edenberg, 1992). The sizes of the introns for the human class IV ADH gene as well as the other known mammalian ADH genes are summarized (Table 1). Except for human class V, which lacks intron 8 (and exon 9), all the genes contain 8 introns that interrupt the coding sequence at the same locations. This indicates that all classes of mammalian ADH are derived from duplication of an ancient gene that already possessed the intron/exon structure shown in the class IV ADH gene. Presumably, the class V ADH gene lost exon 9 subsequent to its divergence from other ADH genes.Tabled 1 The amino acid sequence of human class IV ADH predicted from the coding region indicated that the translated protein would contain 373 amino acids downstream of the initiator methionine (Fig. 2). The predicted amino acid sequence of human class IV ADH was aligned with the recently determined full-length sequence of the rat class IV ADH enzyme (Parés et al., 1994), indicating a rat/human interspecies sequence identity of 87.1%. The human class IV ADH sequence was also aligned with the sequences of the other human classes. The human interclass sequence identity was greater with class I ADH (69%) than with classes II, III, or V (59-61%). This greater interclass sequence identity between classes I and IV was also noticed in a comparison of rat class IV ADH with the other classes of rat ADH (Parés et al., 1994). Thus, it is reasonable to propose that ADH classes I and IV may have diverged from a common ancestral gene subsequent to its divergence from the other classes. Since classes I and IV do share a common catalytic function as retinol dehydrogenases in several mammalian species (Connor and Smit, 1987; Boleda et al., 1993; Yang et al., 1994), this further suggests a common origin. Human genomic DNA was digested with KpnI or Pst I and subjected to Southern blot analysis using as a probe the human class IV ADH cDNA described previously (Satre et al., 1994). This cDNA probe should be able to hybridize to exons 2-9 as well as the 3′-untranslated region. Under the high stringency conditions used for hybridization and washing, the probe should not be able to cross-hybridize to the genes encoding the other classes of ADH, which share less than 70% sequence identity to class IV ADH as described above. The DNA fragments that hybridized are shown (Fig. 3). The sizes of detected fragments match closely with the sizes predicted from the KpnI and Pst I restriction maps of the genomic clones shown above (Fig. 1). This indicates that no major rearrangements occurred during the cloning process. With KpnI digestion (Fig. 3A), the 5.3-kb fragment observed correlates with the size of a region in the cloned DNA containing exons 2-5; the 3.4-kb fragment observed correlates with a fragment in the cloned DNA containing exons 6 and 7; and the 16.0-kb fragment observed presumably contains exons 8 and 9 plus the 3′-untranslated region that would be on a fragment of greater than 4.5 kb based upon the cloned DNA. With PstI digestion (Fig. 3B), the sizes of the hybridizing fragments also correlated with the restriction map; a fragment of 19.6 kb correlates in size with cloned DNA fragments containing exons 2-8, a fragment of 2.2 kb correlates with cloned DNA containing exon 9 plus the proximal end of the 3′-untranslated region, and a fragment of 10.0 most likely contains the distal end of the 3′-untranslated region (downstream of the PstI site), which should be detected with the cDNA probe used. Since all hybridizing DNA fragments in human genomic DNA digested with either KpnI or PstI correlated with the class IV ADH gene cloned, we assume that class IV ADH is encoded by a single unique gene and has no closely related pseudogenes. No pseudogenes were detected in the genomic clones analyzed as well. Of the five classes of mammalian ADH that have been analyzed, only class I ADH has been shown to be encoded by more than one gene in some species; i.e. human class I ADH is encoded by three closely related genes ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3, which cross-hybridize under high stringency (Duester et al., 1986). Only class III ADH (the most ancient form of ADH) has been demonstrated to possess pseudogenes; these were found to be processed pseudogenes (Matsuo and Yokoyama, 1990; Hur and Edenberg, 1992). Human class IV ADH protein has been previously shown to be most abundant in the stomach and esophagus and undetectable in the liver (Yin et al., 1990; Moreno and Parés, 1991; Yin et al., 1993; Stone et al., 1993). To examine the mRNA for class IV ADH, we performed Northern blot analysis on human adult stomach and liver poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 4). Using the class IV ADH cDNA as a probe, a single mRNA species of 2.3 kb was detected in human stomach RNA (Fig. 4D), whereas no mRNA was detected in liver RNA (Fig. 4C). As a control for liver RNA, we used a class I ADH cDNA as a probe (the human ADH3 gene), and detected three mRNA species of 2.6, 1.9, and 1.6 kb present at high levels (Fig. 4A). The expression of class I ADH mRNA we observed in liver correlates with previous studies on human liver RNA, which indicated high levels of mRNA for three forms of class I ADH, i.e. α, β, and γ ADH encoded by ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3, respectively (Bilanchone et al., 1986; Ikuta and Yoshida, 1986). ADH1 and ADH2 mRNAs are detected by cross-hybridization with the ADH3 probe, with all three genes expressing mRNAs of approximately 1.6 kb as well as ADH2 also expressing mRNAs of 1.9 and 2.6 kb by differential polyadenylation (Von Bahr-Lindström et al., 1986; Heden et al., 1986; Höög et al., 1986). We also detected the same three class I ADH mRNAs at lower levels in stomach RNA (Fig. 4B). This correlates with previous studies showing that the stomach mucosal layer contains γ-ADH, and the muscular layer contains β-ADH (Yin et al., 1988; Moreno and Parés, 1991). The presence of class IV ADH mRNA in the stomach but not the liver suggests that its gene is regulated much differently than those encoding the other classes of ADH (classes I, II, III, and V), which are all expressed in the liver (Duester et al., 1986; Höög et al., 1987; Giri et al., 1989; Yasunami et al., 1991). The size of the mRNA for human stomach class IV ADH, estimated here at 2.3 kb by Northern blotting, correlates approximately with the size of the cDNA reported by Farrés et al.(1994), which is 2055 bp in length with a putative poly(A) signal near the 3′ end but no poly(A) stretch. A 5′-untranslated region of 60 bp was reported in that cDNA, but our primer extension studies (discussed below) indicate that the mature mRNA contains 100 bp in the 5′-untranslated region. This would increase the predicted size of the mRNA to about 2095 bp plus the poly(A) stretch, which is generally 100-200 residues. In order to determine where the promoter for the class IV ADH gene lies, we performed primer extension analysis on human stomach poly(A)+ RNA, which was shown above to hybridize to a class IV ADH cDNA probe. The primer consisted of the first 21 bases upstream of the methionine start codon on the noncoding strand. The main primer extension product was extended by reverse transcriptase to an adenine residue lying 100 bp upstream of the methionine start codon (Fig. 5). The sequence surrounding this adenine is pyrimidine-rich (5′-TCTATGT-3′), thus conforming to the consensus of known eukaryotic transcription initiation sites (Breathnach and Chambon, 1981). The sequence downstream of this transcription initiation site (designated as position + 1 bp) contains two ATG triplets (one at +1 and one at +65 bp) prior to the ATG designated as the translation initiation codon at +101 (Fig. 2). Both of the upstream ATGs are flanked by thymines at critical positions (TNNATGT) and are thus classified as nonfunctional for translation initiation (Kozak, 1987). The ATG at position +101 is flanked by an adenine and guanine at these critical positions (ANNATGG) and is one of the most common functional translation initiation codons. The ATG at position +1 is also part of the transcription initiation site and is probably subjected to 5′-capping with 7-methylguanosine, making it even further less likely to be involved in translation initiation. Interestingly, the transcription initiation site for class IV ADH (5′-TCTATGT-3′) has a very similar sequence to the initiation sites previously observed in the three human class I ADH genes (ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3), which were all shown to initiate at an adenine within an ATG surrounded by pyrimidines: (5′-TTTATGC-3′) (Stewart et al., 1990). Computer analysis of the DNA sequence from −496 to +100 bp was performed to scan for potential binding sites of several common transcription factors that may be part of the promoter (Fig. 2). A TATA box was not observed just upstream of the transcription initiation site near position −25 bp, which is its usual location if present (Breathnach and Chambon, 1981). However, we did observe the sequence TATATAA located from +28 to +22 bp downstream of the start site in the reverse orientation on the noncoding strand. Since the adenovirus IVa2 promoter has been shown to have a functional TATA box located about 20 bp downstream of the start site in the reverse orientation (Carcamo et al., 1990), the downstream TATA we observe in class IV ADH may also function in an unusual type of initiation event. We did not observe any GC-box binding sites (GGGCGG) for the transcription factor Sp1, which are often present in genes lacking a TATA box, nor other common sites such as those binding transcription factor CTF/NF1 (GCCAAT) and octamer-binding proteins (ATTTGCAT) (Mitchell and Tjian, 1989). This promoter also does not possess the initiator element (YAYTCYYY) often found overlapping with the site of transcription initiation, which can be found in genes that either contain or lack a TATA box (Roeder, 1991). The class IV ADH promoter was found to contain a site at −43 bp matching the TGA(C/G)TCA consensus sequence for the transcription factor AP-1 (Mitchell and Tjian, 1989), as well as a site at −35 bp matching the T(T/G)NNG(T/C)AA(T/G) consensus sequence for C/EBP (De Simone and Cortese, 1992) (Fig. 2). The lack of an upstream TATA box at −25 bp or GC boxes to help direct the site of transcription initiation suggests that the AP-1 and C/EBP sites lying adjacent to each other between −43 and −27 bp may function together or separately to help direct transcription initiation for class IV ADH. Alternatively, this promoter may use the downstream TATA box or a novel mechanism. In this respect, the class IV ADH promoter is unlike the other ADH promoters characterized, which have either an upstream TATA box, i.e. the promoters for class I ADH (Duester et al., 1986; Stewart et al., 1990) and class II ADH (Von Bahr-Lindström et al., 1991), or GC boxes clustered near the start site, i.e. the promoter for class III ADH (Hur and Edenberg, 1992). The presence of a C/EBP site in the class IV ADH promoter between −35 and −27 bp is similar to what was noticed for the three human class I ADH promoters that have previously been demonstrated to possess functional C/EBP sites between −45 and −37 bp (Van Ooij et al., 1992). However, the class I ADH promoters also contain a TATA box just downstream of this C/EBP site, and they contain additional C/EBP sites further upstream. Thus, if C/EBP plays a role in class IV ADH transcription, it may function differently than it does in class I ADH transcription where several related forms of C/EBP have been demonstrated to play a role in liver transcription (Van Ooij et al., 1992). The lack of class IV ADH expression in the liver further suggests a fundamentally different form of regulation than that seen for class I ADH genes. Finally, the class IV ADH promoter did not possess a retinoic acid response element in the region analyzed, thus differing from the human class I ADH gene ADH3, which was found to possess this element at −300 bp (Duester et al., 1991). In summary, human class IV ADH was shown to be encoded by a single gene whose coding region is most closely related to that of class I ADH. However, the expression pattern of class IV ADH differs markedly from class I ADH. The mRNA for class IV ADH was shown to be much more abundant in stomach than liver, thus differing from the mRNA for class I ADH and other known ADHs, which are all actively expressed in liver. The promoter for class IV ADH is much different than those seen in other ADH genes, lacking many of the common sequence elements that direct transcription initiation and thus representing an unusual type of promoter. The cloning of the class IV ADH gene now enables us to use molecular genetic techniques to further study its expression patterns, gene regulation, and function, particularly its role in retinoid metabolism as a retinol dehydrogenase.

We have generated and characterized the COOH terminus of caldesmon mutants lacking mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, because the COOH-terminal half of caldesmon contains all 7 putative Ser or Thr sites for cdc2 kinase. Codons for the 7 putative Ser or Thr residues have been mutated to Ala, and resultant mutants were bacterially expressed. Analyses of the phosphopeptide maps of these mutants have identified 6 sites, including Ser-249, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, Ser-497, and Ser-527 as the mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, whereas the phosphorylation of the remaining site, Thr-377, is not detected by this assay method. Actin binding experiments have suggested that 5 sites including Ser-249, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, and Ser-497 are important for the phosphorylation-dependent reduction in actin binding. Characterization of a mutant lacking all 7 Ser or Thr sites (7-fold mutant) has revealed that 7-fold mutation eliminates all phosphorylation sites by cdc2 kinase. While the in vitro properties of the 7-fold mutant, including actin, myosin, and calmodulin binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, are very similar to those of nonmutated protein, such properties are not affected by the treatment with cdc2 kinase in contrast to nonmutated protein. This mutant should thus be useful to explore the functions of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of caldesmon.

This mutant should thus be useful to explore the functions of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of caldesmon. Microfilaments in cultured cells show drastic changes in their organization during mitosis(1Sanger J.W. Sanger J.M. Goldman R. Pollard T. Rosenbaum J. Cell Motility. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 1295-1316Google Scholar, 2Schroeder T.E. Goldman R. Pollard T. Rosenbaum J. Cell Motility. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 265-278Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the molecular bases for these changes. Because a variety of actin-binding proteins regulate actin assembly and organization of microfilaments(3Craig S.W. Pollard T.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 88-92Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Weeds A. Nature. 1982; 296: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it is likely that they are involved in the changes in microfilament organization during mitosis. We have demonstrated previously that non-muscle caldesmon is specifically dissociated from microfilaments during mitosis, apparently as a consequence of the mitosis-specific phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase(5Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ishikawa R. Matsumura F. Nature. 1990; 344: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Others also have shown that cdc2 kinase phosphorylates smooth muscle caldesmon(7Mak A.S. Watson M.H. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6678-6681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggested that the dissociation of caldesmon may cause, at least in part, the alterations in the microfilament organization during mitosis, because caldesmon is a regulatory protein implicated in the control of actomyosin interactions and/or microfilament organization. In a reconstituted system, caldesmon functions in the following three ways (see (8Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10Matsumura F. Yamashiro S. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1993; 5: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for reviews). First, caldesmon inhibits the tropomyosin-stimulated, actin-activated ATPase of myosin(11Sobue K. Takahashi K. Wakabayashi I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Smith C.W. Pritchard K. Marston S.B. J. Biol.

This inhibition is attenuated by Ca2+/calmodulin, which reverses actin binding by caldesmon. Second, caldesmon, together with tropomyosin, regulates stability of actin filaments in vitro. Caldesmon stimulates actin binding of tropomyosin which increases the stabilization of actin filament structure(17Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Bretscher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12873-12880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, caldesmon and tropomyosin together also inhibit the actin severing and capping activities of gelsolin(19Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16764-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, caldesmon stimulates actin polymerization(21Galazkiewicz B. Buss F. Jockusch B.M. Dabrowska R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Galazkiewicz B. Belagyi J. Dabrowska R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the dissociation of caldesmon from microfilaments may release the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, destabilize microfilament structure, and/or change actin polymerization. The cdc2 kinase constitutes a subunit of MPF (maturation or M-phase promoting factor), a cell cycle control element that initiates all of the events seen during mitosis in eukaryotes (see (23Lewin B. Cell. 1990; 61: 743-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24Hunt T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Lohka M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 131-135PubMed Google Scholar) for review). The finding that caldesmon is phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase poses a question: how does this cell cycle control element regulate microfilament organization during mitosis? One way to address this question is to generate mutant caldesmons lacking phosphorylation sites and to see what effects mutant caldesmons have on the microfilament organization during mitosis. As a first approach toward this goal we have generated mutant caldesmons lacking phosphorylation sites through site-directed mutagenesis. Rat non-muscle caldesmon contains seven putative phosphorylation sites (Ser or Thr)-Pro, for cdc2 kinase, all of which are mutated to Ala. Analyses of phosphorylation patterns of the mutants have allowed us to identify the phosphorylation sites of rat non-muscle caldesmon by cdc2 kinase. We have generated and characterized a mutant, in which all seven sites are mutated. We have found that such 7-fold mutation completely eliminates phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase and that treatment with cdc2 kinase does not affect the in vitro properties of the mutant, including actin, myosin, and calmodulin binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. Restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and linker DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs; Sequenase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; and the in vitro mutagenesis kit was from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. cdc2 kinase was prepared from mitotic Hela cells by the method described previously(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A λgt11 expression library and a λZAPcDNA library constructed from rat liver mRNA were purchased from ClonTech and Stratagene, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat non-muscle caldesmon were used to screen the λgt11 library. Initial screening resulted in the isolation of two nonoverlapping clones, A16 (0.8 kb) 1The abbreviation used is: kbkilobase pair(s). and D3 (1.3 kb). In order to confirm the authenticity of the clones, caldesmon mRNAs were hybrid-selected from rat poly(A) mRNA using cDNAs purified from a single plaque of each clone and translated in vitro with rabbit reticulocytes (Promega). The in vitro translated products were identified as rat non-muscle caldesmon by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting (data not shown). Isolation of overlapping cDNA clones was performed with the λZAP cDNA library using 32P-labeled probe (Random prime kit, Boehringer Mannheim) of either clone A16 or clone D3. kilobase pair(s). A bacterial expression vector, pET11d vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), was used for the expression of the COOH terminus of caldesmon cDNA, D3. The pET11d translation vector has an ATG initiation codon at a unique restriction site for NcoI and is under the control of a T7 lac promoter. Protein synthesis will be started from this initiation codon, and the resulting protein has 2 foreign amino acids, methionine and alanine, at its NH2 terminus. The construction of a vector, pET11d-D3, expressing the COOH-terminal peptide of caldesmon (called D3 protein) was done as follows. The clone D3 has a termination codon at position 892 and encodes the COOH-terminal half (Glu-235 to Val-531) of rat non-muscle caldesmon. The cDNA insert of clone D3 was isolated from the λgt11 clone by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into plasmid pUC13. Cleavage of the plasmid pUC13 containing the D3 insert with EcoRI and HincII resulted in a 1.1-kilobase EcoRI-HincII fragment which included the COOH-terminal coding region of caldesmon, as well as the termination codon at position 892. A BamHI linker was first ligated to the 3′ blunt end of the HincII site of the fragment. The 5′ end of the EcoRI site was then filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and then ligated to a NcoI linker. After restriction digestion with both NcoI and BamHI followed by purification with preparative electrophoresis, the fragment was subcloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET11d vector. The bacterial hosts for cloning and expression were the E. coli K12 strain HB101 and the B strain BL21(DE3)plysS, respectively. We grew BL21(DE3)plysS in M9ZB medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. The expression of the target protein was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM of isopropyl-1-thio-galactopyranoside when culture reached an OD600 of 0.5-0.6. After 2 h of induction, the bacteria were lysed by sonication in 0.1 M NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl of pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was heat-treated at 95°C for 10 min, cooled on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged again. The supernatant was then applied on a calmodulin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After extensive washing of the column with 50 mM imidazole buffer of pH 7.0 containing 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, D3 protein was purified by the elution with the same buffer except that 0.5 mM CaCl2 was replaced with 2 mM EGTA. Approximately 2 mg of D3 protein were prepared from 10 liters of bacterial culture. The 1.1-kilobase EcoRI-HincII fragment of clone D3 was cloned into a pTZ19U vector and then utilized for oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using a muta-gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, phagemid particles whose single strand of DNA contained some uracils were produced from a E. coli dut, ung strain by superinfection with the helper phage M13KO7. The uracil-containing single strand DNA was purified, used as a template in an in vitro mutagenesis reaction, and transformed into a strain with selection against the parental uracil-containing strand. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers for mutagenesis from Ser or Thr to Ala: 5′-AGTGCTTCGCTCCTAAA-3′ for Thr-377 to Ala; 5′-TGTTTTCAGCCCCCTCT-3′ for Ser-462 to Ala; 5′-CCTCGGGGGCACCAAAT-3′ for Thr-468 to Ala; 5′-TAACTAAAGCGCCGGAC-3′ for Ser-491 to Ala; 5′-GCAACAAGGCACCCGCT-3′ for Ser-497 to Ala; 5′-AGGTCACTGCTCCCACT-3′ for Ser-527 to Ala; 5′-TGTTTTCAGCCCCCTCTGCCTCGGGGGCACCAAAT-3′ for a double mutation of Ser-462 and Thr468 to Ala; and 5′-TAACTAAAGCGCCGGACGGCAACAAGGCACCCGCT-3′ for a double mutation of Ser-491 and Ser-497 to Ala. In addition, two oligonucleotides, 5′-GAGAATGCTTTCACCCCCAGCCGTTCAG-3′ and 5′-GAGAATGCTTTCGCCCCCAGCCGTTCAG-3′, were used sequentially to mutate Ser-249 to Ala. Complementary strands were synthesized and transformed into E. coli MV1190 to replicate only mutant strands. Mutant clones were sequenced by the dideoxy single strand DNA sequencing method using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). In order to generate 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-fold mutations, a double-mutated clone (Ser-462/Thr-468 to Ala) was further mutated at Ser-491, Ser-497, Ser-527, Thr-377, and Ser-249 in this order using the above mentioned oligonucleotides. Nonmutated D3 proteins, as well as single, double, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, and 7-fold mutant D3 proteins were expressed in E. coli using the pET11d vector and purified as described above. Actin Binding Assay-Actin binding of D3 peptide and its mutants was performed in essentially the same way as described for actin binding of intact caldesmon(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay conditions were 20 mM imidazole buffer of pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 12 μM F-actin and varying amounts of D3 protein and its mutants from 0 to 8 μM. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 26 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge. Both supernatants and pellets dissolved in the same volume of SDS sample buffer were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amounts of D3 protein were determined by densitometry as described (26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of D3 protein and its mutants by cdc2 kinase was performed as described(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated proteins were purified by heat treatment and examined for actin binding as described(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activities were measured in 20 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05 mg/ml of skeletal muscle myosin, 0.5 mg/ml of skeletal muscle actin, 0.2 mg/ml chick gizzard tropomyosin, and varying amounts (0-0.3 mg/ml) of D3 or 7-fold mutant. The reactions were started by the addition of 1 mM ATP containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphate liberation was determined according to the method described by Korn et al.(27Korn E.D. Collins J.H. Maruta H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional peptide mapping was performed as described previously(6Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was as described(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); protein assay was done according to the method of Bradford(28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211703) Google Scholar). We isolated two nonoverlapping cDNA clones, A16 (0.8 kb) and D3 (1.6 kb), from a λgt11 cDNA library using antibody screening. Using these two clones as probes, we then isolated three overlapping cDNA clones, A18 (1.2 kb), AD24 (2.8 kb), and D43 (3.6 kb), from rat liver λZAP libraries (Fig. 1). These clones were sequenced to generate a 5575-base pair “group of overlapping clones,” including the entire coding region as well as 723 base pairs of 5′-noncoding and 3259 base pairs of 3′-noncoding regions (the nucleotide sequence was submitted to GenBank). Northern blot analyses, using either A16 or D3 as probes, revealed only one size of mRNA (about 5 kb) in both rat smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. The largest open reading frame starts with Met at position 724, which does not begin with a typical Kozak consensus sequence. The reading frame terminates at position 2316 and encodes 531 amino acids. Peptide sequences of two CNBr fragments of 83-kDa non-muscle caldesmon match the amino acid sequences derived from the DNA sequence, confirming the authenticity of the cDNAs(6Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The deduced protein molecular weight is 60,607 which is significantly less than the molecular weight (83,000) estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. Chick and human caldesmons have also been reported to show a higher molecular weight on SDS gels(29Bryan J. Imai M. Lee R. Moore P. Cook R.G. Lin W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13873-13879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hayashi K. Fujio Y. Kato I. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 355-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to generate and characterize caldesmon mutants lacking mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites, we have chosen the clone D3 encoding the COOH-terminal half (Glu-235 to Val-531) of caldesmon, because all seven putative phosphorylation sites of cdc2 kinase are included in this cDNA (see Fig. 2), and because the COOH terminus has all the functional properties of caldesmon except for myosin binding of the NH2 terminus. Before generating mutants, we have characterized bacterially expressed, nonmutated, D3 protein. As Fig. 3 shows, the protein was purified from a soluble fraction followed by heat treatment and calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column chromatography. As shown later (see Fig. 8), D3 protein binds to actin as expected for the COOH-terminal domain of caldesmon. The apparent dissociation constant of actin binding is 0.2 μM, which is similar to that of intact authentic caldesmon(17Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results indicate that D3 protein is native in terms of solubility, heat stability, and calmodulin and actin binding abilities.Figure 3:Bacterial expression of D3 protein (the COOH terminus of rat non-muscle caldesmon, Glu-235 to Val-531).

A two-dimensional phosphopeptide map (Fig. 4A) of D3 protein phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase is identical to that produced with authentic rat non-muscle caldesmon (compare with Fig. 2B of (26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results further support the nativeness of D3 protein and indicate that D3 protein can be used for identification of all cdc2 phosphorylation sites through in vitro mutagenesis. We have examined whether mutations at the putative phosphorylation sites eliminate the phosphorylation at their sites by cdc2 kinase. Seven putative phosphorylation sites with a consensus sequence (Thr/Ser-Pro) for cdc2 kinase (see Fig. 2 for their positions) were mutated from serine or threonine to alanine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Such mutants, as well as nonmutated D3 (designated wild D3 protein), were expressed in bacteria. All mutants were purified from a soluble fraction followed by heat treatment and calmodulin-Sepharose affinity column chromatography, indicating that the mutants are native and retain the calmodulin binding ability. After phosphorylation with cdc2 kinase, phosphorylation patterns were analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping. First, the effects of three single mutations of Ser-249 to Ala, Thr-377 to Ala and Ser-527 to Ala were examined (Fig. 4). The Ser-249 to Ala mutation (B) causes disappearance of two major (spots a and b) and one minor spots (indicated by c), suggesting that Ser-249 is a phosphorylation site by cdc2 kinase. This assignment is consistent with the phosphoamino acid analyses showing that spots a, b, and c are phosphoserine (data not shown). Likewise, the single point mutation at Ser-527 (D) reproducibly eliminates one major spot (spot d). This is again consistent with the phosphoamino acid analyses which reveal that spot d contains phosphoserine. Ser-527 is thus identified as a site of phosphorylation. On the other hand, Thr-337 is not detected as a major phosphorylation site by this assay method. A phosphopeptide map (C) generated by the Thr-377 to Ala mutant appears very similar to that (A) produced by wild D3 protein. We have next examined whether Ser-462 and Thr-468 are phosphorylation sites (Fig. 5). A single point mutation (B) at Ser-462 to Ala causes disappearance of two spots, e and f. On the other hand, a single point mutation at Thr-468 to Ala (C) eliminates two spots, g and f. Phosphoamino acid analyses have revealed that spot e is phosphoserine, whereas spot g is phosphothreonine (phosphoamino acid of spot f is not determined). These results suggest that (a) spot e is Ser-462; (b) spot g is Thr-468; and (c) spot f is generated by double phosphorylation at both Ser-462 and Thr-468. A double mutation at both sites (D) eliminates one additional spot h in addition to the above three spots, e-g. Phosphoamino acid analyses have revealed that spot h contains both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. These results may be explained in the following way: spot h may be a mixture of two phosphopeptides which are generated by single phosphorylation at either Ser-462 or Thr-468 and co-migrate at the same position of h; thus only double mutations but not single mutations can eliminate the spot h. The identification of spot h as the phosphorylation site at Ser-462 or Thr-468 is further supported by a phosphopeptide map generated by phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (KGSVFSSPSASGTPNKE) corresponding to these sites. The peptide was phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 kinase, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by two-dimensional mapping. The analysis of a mixture of phosphorylated caldesmon and synthetic peptide has revealed that a spot generated by the peptide co-migrates with the spot h (data not shown). Ser-491 and Ser-497 also are phosphorylation sites (Fig. 6). A single mutation at Ser-497 (C) eliminates a cluster of spots (indicated by i) and generates a new spot j, indicating that the cluster i is generated by phosphorylation at Ser-497. A single mutation at Ser-491 (B), on the other hand, does not seem to change the peptide pattern significantly. However, a double mutation at both sites (D) eliminates not only the cluster i, but also a spot, k. In addition, the new spot, j, disappears, suggesting that the new spot, j, is a product of Ser-491 phosphorylation. These results indicate that both Ser-491 and Ser-497 are involved in the phosphorylation and suggest that spot k may contain two phosphopeptides, each of which is singly phosphorylated at either Ser-491 or Ser-497, but co-migrates at the same position, k. Consistent with the above explanation, spot k is shown to contain phosphoserine, although phosphoamino acid analyses failed to reveal the content of the spots in the cluster i. It is also noticed that spot g, which is assigned as Thr-468, disappears in the maps of the double mutation. Although the reason for this is unknown, one possible explanation is that the phosphorylation at Thr-468 may occur only after the phosphorylation at the Ser-491 and Ser-497 sites. This explanation is consistent with the disappearance of spot f, which is thought to be produced by the double phosphorylation at Ser-462 and Thr-468. We have further examined phosphopeptide maps of 6-fold (mutations at Thr-377, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, Ser-497, and Ser-527 to Ala) and 7-fold (mutations at Ser-249, Thr-377, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, Ser-497, and Ser-527 to Ala) mutants. As Fig. 7B shows, the map of the 6-fold mutant yields two major (a and b) and three minor (c, l, and m) spots, of which three spots, a-c, are assigned as Ser-249 (see Fig. 4B). Consistent with this assignment, these three spots, a-c, disappear in the map of 7-fold mutants (Fig. 7B). In addition, two other minor spots, l and m, also disappear, although we do not know why the two minor spots disappear by 7-fold mutation. Thus the map of 7-fold mutants shows virtually no phosphopeptide spots, indicating that all cdc2 phosphorylation sites are blocked by 7-fold mutation. This is consistent with the observation that the 7-fold mutant does not incorporate any significant 32P radioactivity in phosphorylation experiments with cdc2 kinase (data not shown). To explore the effects of the mutations on phosphorylation-dependent reduction of actin binding of caldesmon, we have examined actin binding abilities of the following proteins: wild D3 protein, two kinds of double mutants (Ser-462/Thr-468 to Ala or Ser-491/Ser-497 to Ala), 4-fold (Ser-462/Thr-468/Ser-491/Ser-497 to Ala), 5-fold (Ser-462/Thr-468/Ser-491/Ser-497/Ser-527 to Ala; addition of Ser-527 mutation to the 4-fold mutation), 6-fold (Thr-377/Ser-462/Thr-468/Ser-491/Ser-497/Ser-527 to Ala; addition of Thr-377 mutation to the 5-fold mutation), and 7-fold (Ser-249/Thr-377/Ser-462/Thr-468/Ser-491/Ser-497/Ser-527 to Ala; addition of Ser-249 mutation to the 6-fold mutation) mutants. Two pairs of sites were chosen for the double mutations, because two sites of each pair are closely spaced. First, actin binding of unphosphorylated proteins was measured as controls. As Fig. 8 shows, all unphosphorylated mutants exhibit actin binding profiles almost identical to that of unphosphorylated wild type D3 protein. These results suggest that the mutations at these sites do not affect actin binding properties to any significant extent. Phosphorylation of wild type D3 protein with cdc2 kinase causes almost complete loss of its actin binding ability, where the apparent binding constant is reduced from 5 × 106 to less than 104M−1. This extent of reduction in binding constants is similar to that observed with intact caldesmon(26Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blockade of the phosphorylation sites abolishes phosphorylation-dependent reduction in actin binding. As Fig. 8, A and B, show, the double and 4-fold mutations partially inhibit this phosphorylation-dependent reduction in actin binding. The apparent binding constants of the phosphorylated double and 4-fold mutant D3 proteins are increased to 5 × 105 and 2 × 106M−1, respectively. Further mutation at Ser-527 (5-fold mutation) or at both Ser-527 and Thr-377 (6-fold mutation) shows only a slight increase on actin binding upon phosphorylation over the actin binding of 4-fold mutant (B). The seventh mutation at Ser-249, however, yields a large effect on the phosphorylation-dependent actin binding. Actin binding of 7-fold mutant is not decreased after phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase (C). The absence of the phosphorylation effect is consistent with the observation that cdc2 kinase is unable to phosphorylate the 7-fold mutant. 7-Fold mutation also attenuates the effects of phosphorylation on caldesmon's ability to inhibit actomyosin ATPase. As Fig. 9 shows, phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase completely abolishes the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase by D3 protein. On the contrary, the ability of the 7-fold mutant to inhibit ATPase activity is little affected by treatment with cdc2 kinase. We have also examined the effects of 7-fold mutation on caldesmon's other properties including myosin binding, stimulation of actin-tropomyosin binding, and calmodulin regulation of actin binding. 7-fold mutation does not affect these properties (data not shown). Furthermore, as expected by the lack of phosphorylation in 7-fold mutant, cdc2 kinase does not alter these properties of 7-fold mutant (data not shown). In this paper, we have generated and characterized a variety of mutants of the COOH terminus of rat non-muscle caldesmon lacking cdc2 phosphorylation sites. Our studies have revealed the following important points; (a) among the seven putative cdc2 sites of rat non-muscle caldesmon, six sites (Ser-249, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, Ser-497, and Ser-527) are identified as the major cdc2 phosphorylation sites, whereas the remaining site of Thr-377 is not detected as a major phosphorylation site; (b) five sites (Ser-249, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, and Ser-497) are more important than the other two sites (Ser-527 and Thr-377) in controlling caldesmon-actin interactions; (c) the 7-fold mutation eliminates all cdc2 phosphorylation sites of rat non-muscle caldesmon; and (d) in vitro properties of the 7-fold mutant, including actin binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, are affected neither by the mutation itself nor by phosphorylation with cdc2 kinase. Our work suggests that five sites including Ser-249, Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, and Ser-497 are equally important. Among the six phosphorylation sites, four sites, including Ser-462, Thr-468, Ser-491, and Ser-497, are well conserved among rat, human, and chick caldesmons (6Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Novy R.E. Lin J.L. Lin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16917-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Mak et al. (32Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that cdc2 mainly phosphorylates these four sites of chick smooth muscle caldesmon. However, the mutation at these four sites does not completely block the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of actin binding of rat non-muscle caldesmon. Phosphorylation at Ser-249 is equally important for reducing actin binding of rat non-muscle caldesmon (Fig. 8), although phosphorylation at the site corresponding to Ser-249 was not reported with chick smooth muscle caldesmon. In contrast, the mutations at Thr-377 and Ser-527 show meager effects on the phosphorylation-dependent actin-caldesmon interactions. Both 5- and 6-fold mutants shows only a slight increase in actin binding over the 4-fold mutant upon phosphorylation. Fig. 10 shows the domain structure of rat non-muscle caldesmon with the sites of phosphorylation indicated. It should be noted that all these phosphorylation sites except for Ser-527 are localized outside of actin and calmodulin-binding domains. This is consistent with our finding that all mutants lacking phosphorylation sites shows normal actin and calmodulin binding. This notion suggests that the domain(s) containing these phosphorylation sites would interact with the strong actin binding domain (Leu-392 to Ile-424). Alternatively, the phosphorylation at these sites would induce conformational changes, which result in low actin and calmodulin binding of caldesmon. These possibilities are intriguing, since one of the sites, Ser-249, is, in the primary sequence, located far from the strong actin binding domain. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify cdc2 phosphorylation sites. The mutagenesis method has an advantage over the conventional method of peptide sequencing of purified phosphopeptides. It allows us to prepare and characterize mutants at the same time. However, the mutagenesis method is an indirect way to identify sites, and it is possible that the mutagenesis method may not be as sensitive as the conventional method. Indeed, this may explain one of the differences between our work and that of Mak et al.(32Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although we have not detected the phosphorylation of Thr-377, Mak et al. (32Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified Ser-582 (corresponding to rat Thr-377) of chick smooth muscle caldesmon through peptide sequencing of purified phosphopeptides(32Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the level of the phosphorylation at Ser-582 was reported to be very low (about 13% of total phosphorylation), the mutagenesis method may not detect phosphorylation at Thr-377. In any case, the phosphorylation at rat Thr-377, if it occurs, appears to be minor. This notion is consistent with the observation that the mutation at this site does not largely affect the phosphorylation-dependent reduction of actin binding; actin binding of the 6-fold mutant is indistinguishable from the 5-fold mutant (Fig. 8). Our work has identified two other cdc2 phosphorylation sites, Ser-249 and Ser-527, with rat non-muscle cadesmon, which have not been reported with chick smooth muscle caldesmon by Mak et al.(32Mak A.S. Carpenter M. Smillie L.B. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19971-19975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While Ser-527 is unique to mammalian caldesmons(6Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Novy R.E. Lin J.L. Lin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16917-16924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chick smooth muscle caldesmon has Thr-470 whose relative position is similar, although not identical, to the position of Ser-249 of rat caldesmon. This difference can be explained by the fact that the sequences around these two sites are rather different. Alternatively, the central domain of smooth muscle caldesmon may inhibit the phosphorylation of Thr-470. Redwood et al.(33Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. Gusev N.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that the mutation at Ser-702 (corresponding to Ser-497 of rat non-muscle caldesmon) to Asp reduces the actin binding ability of the mutant, whereas the mutation at Thr-673 (corresponding to Thr-468 of rat non-muscle caldesmon) to Asp does not. Our results, on the other hand, have shown that caldesmons with double mutations at either Ser-462/Thr-468 or Ser-491/Ser-497 show indistinguishable effects on actin binding after phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase (Fig. 8). Together, these results would then suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-462 is more critical for the regulation of actin binding than phosphorylation at Thr-468. It is possible that the 7-fold mutant behaves as a dominant negative mutant. The 7-fold mutation should eliminate all cdc2 phosphorylation sites of the entire caldesmon molecule, because the phosphopeptide map of the C terminus of caldesmon is exactly the same as that of intact caldesmon. The 7-fold mutation itself does not alter the properties of caldesmon, including binding to actin, calmodulin, and myosin, inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, stimulation of actin-tropomyosin binding, and calmodulin regulation of actin binding. More importantly, cdc2 kinase does not affect these properties of the 7-fold mutant, as expected from the lack of phosphorylation. Thus the mutant, when expressed in cultured cells, would stay bound to microfilaments, whereas endogenous wild type caldesmon is dissociated from microfilaments. This may cause stabilization of microfilaments and/or inhibition of actomyosin ATPase during mitosis. Our next goal is to see what effects the mutant caldesmon has on microfilament organization during mitosis. We are in the process of transfection experiments with wild type and mutant caldesmon in cultured cells."

Thus, both RyRs may serve as SR Ca2+ release channels. In vitro studies indicate that these RyRs may be regulated differentially by phosphorylation and calmodulin (7Airey J.A. Grinsell M.M. Jones L.R. Sutko J.L. Witcher D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5739-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and have different ion channel properties(6Percival A.L. Williams A.J. Kenyon J.L. Grinsell M.M. Airey J.A. Sutko J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1834-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, the chicken αRyR is activated by ATP to a relatively greater extent than by Ca2+, while the reverse is true for the βRyR channel. Such differences have also been reported for the two RyRs expressed in frog skeletal muscle(3Marayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Bull R. Marengo J.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nonmammalian vertebrate αRyRs appear to be homologs of the mammalian skeletal muscle RyR isoform, RyR1, while the βRyRs are more closely related to the mammalian RyR, RyR32,3 (9). The latter RyR was initially cloned from the brain (10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) but appears to be expressed in a number of tissues, including skeletal muscle(10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K.

Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Our studies describe two aspects of the roles of the α- and βRyRs in striated muscles. The first concerns whether the RyRs are determinants of the type of E-C coupling used in embryonic skeletal muscle. The second aspect concerns the contributions made by each RyR in a two-RyR E-C coupling system. At least two E-C coupling mechanisms exist in striated muscles(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, Ca2+ entering the cell as L-type Ca2+ currents through dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) channels activates the cardiac RyR isoform (RyR2) channel resulting in a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). This type of coupling is defined experimentally by its dependence on Ca2+o(13Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, DHPRs acting as voltage sensors are thought to interact with the RyR1 isoform, either directly or indirectly via an intermediary protein(s) in a voltage-dependent manner to cause a directly coupled SR Ca2+ release (DCCR)(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx is not required for DCCR and thus it is independent of Ca2+o. Recently, both DCCR and CICR mechanisms have been proposed to activate SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Rios E. Pizarro G. News Physiol. Sci. 1988; 3: 223-227Google Scholar, 15Jacquemond V. Csernoch L. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 867-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this case the activating Ca2+ involved in the CICR mechanism is thought to be that released by DCCR rather than Ca2+ entering the cell. While the existence of CICR in skeletal muscle is controversial(16Pape P.C. Jong D.-S. Chandler W.K. Baylor S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that the αRyR is activated by DCCR, while the β isoform subserves a CICR mechanism.We have investigated these issues within the context of the recessive lethal cn mutation, in chickens, which results in an embryonic skeletal muscle dysgenesis, the failure to maintain skeletal muscles once they have formed, and ultimately the progressive degeneration of all skeletal muscles(17Kieny M. Boutineau A.-M. Pautou M.-P. Goetinck P.F. Biol. Struct. Morphol. 1988; 1: 15-27PubMed Google Scholar, 18Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J.

Although we have not established the genetic nature of the cn mutation, there is a failure to make normal αRyR in cn/cn tissues, while cultured cn/cn muscle cells express normal levels of the βRyR(18Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Talvenheimo J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Airey J.A.

Thus, the use of +/? cells, which have a wild type phenotype, and cn/cn cells permits comparison of muscle cells expressing both α and βRyRs with ones expressing only the βRyR.MATERIALS AND METHODSWith two exceptions skeletal muscle cells from pectoral muscles from day E10-E12 embryos were cultured as described previously(19Airey J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. Ivanenko A. Kenyon J.L. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). First, cells were plated at a total cell density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2, and second, no attempt was made to eliminate fibroblasts. These changes promoted muscle cell differentiation. Intracellular calcium transients and contractions were recorded as described previously(19Airey J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. Ivanenko A. Kenyon J.L. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Normal Ca2+owas 2 mM, and the absence of Ca2+omeans no Ca2+ was added. Contaminating Ca2+ was 3-8 μM. Electrical stimuli were applied for 4 ms via a glass pipette placed close to the cell being studied, and caffeine (10 mM) and acetylcholine (100 μM) were administered locally via pipettes using a Picospritzer.RESULTSCell Growth and Myotube FormationAt the total cell densities used in these studies, both +/? and cn/cn skeletal muscle cells formed comparable numbers of similarly sized myotubes. The only difference discernible between these cells at the light microscope level was a failure of cn/cn cells to develop well defined cross-striations. This is consistent with similar observations made for cn/cn cells cultured at a lower cell density(19Airey J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. Ivanenko A. Kenyon J.L. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).E-C CouplingCa2+ transients were elicited by electrical stimuli to assess the nature of the E-C coupling process in +/? and cn/cn muscle cells at days 3, 5, 7, and 10 in culture. On day 3, Ca2+ transients having relatively slow on and off kinetics were observed in the presence but not the absence of Ca2+o in all 50 +/? cells tested (Figure 1:, Figure 2:, Figure 3:). In 10 responses that were quantitated, the time to the peak of the Ca2+ transient was 1.39 ± 1.14 s. Caffeine (10 mM) produced similar Ca2+ transients in +/? cells on both day 3 and day 10 (Fig. 1C) that were blocked by ryanodine. Thus, the requirement for Ca2+o observed at day 3 did not involve a depletion of releasable SR Ca2+ stores. On day 5 the Ca2+ transients in +/? cells had more rapid on and off rates and were observed in ~40% of the cells in the absence of Ca2+o (Fig. 3). By day 7, the Ca2+ transients in +/? cells appeared more robust in both amplitude and kinetics (time to the peak of the Ca2+ transient = 0.09 ± 0.03 s, n = 10) and could be elicited in the absence of Ca2+o in 100% of the cells. Ca2+o-independent E-C coupling was also observed in 100% of the +/? cells tested on day 10 (Fig. 3).Figure 1:SR Ca2+ release transients (indo-1 fluorescence) induced by electrical stimulation for 4 ms (small arrows) in +/? embryonic chick skeletal muscle cells maintained in culture for 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. The traces in panelsA and B show responses obtained in 2 mM Ca2+o and in the absence of added Ca2+o, respectively. Responses to transient applications of 10 mM caffeine (horizontalbar) in the absence of Ca2+o are shown in panel C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Ca2+ transients in cn/cn muscle cells on day 3 were similar to those in +/? cells at this time in that they were Ca2+o-dependent and had slow on and off rates (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). Unlike +/? cells though, the Ca2+ transients observed in cn/cn cells on days 5 and 7 did not have the more rapid kinetics and were not Ca2+o-independent in any of the cells tested (Figure 2:, Figure 3:). By day 10, many cn/cn cells no longer responded with even Ca2+o-dependent Ca2+ transients. This inability was not due to depletion of SR Ca2+ stores, as caffeine elicited ryanodine-sensitive transients in the absence of Ca2+o in every cell tested. Similar results were obtained when acetylcholine was used to activate the cells (data not shown).Figure 2:SR Ca2+ release transients in cultured cn/cn embryonic chick skeletal muscle cells.

Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. Ivanenko A. Kenyon J.L. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), there are differences in the contractile activity in +/? and cn/cn cells. At all days tested, electrical stimuli caused coordinated, whole cell contractions from +/? cells. Moreover, as they matured in culture, +/? cells developed spontaneous and vigorous contractions. In contrast, cn/cn cells did not exhibit whole cell contractions either spontaneously or in response to electrical stimuli at any time but did display very localized muscle cell vesiculations that appeared as repetitive ripples in the cell surface. These responses accompanied low level oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ and could occur at different loci within the same cell, but the activities at different foci did not appear to be coordinated (data not shown).Muscle Cell Viability+/? and cn/cn muscle cells also differed in that cn/cn cells degenerated and died. The timing of this phenomenon was dependent on cell density. At the plating density used in the present studies, noticeable cell deterioration and cell loss occurred by ~days 12 and 14, respectively. When cells were plated at a 5-fold greater initial total cell density (5 × 105 cells/cm2) degeneration and cell death were observed after ~5 days in culture and became more precipitous, frequently requiring less than 10 h.DISCUSSIONAlthough we have not identified the primary defect associated with the cn mutation, we have shown that cn/cn tissues fail to make normal αRyR, and several observations support the hypothesis that this defect exists in the αRyR gene(18Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Talvenheimo J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the phenotype described for other conditions that disrupt E-C coupling is similar, if not identical, to that of the cn/cn muscle. Most notable of these are the muscle dysgenesis (mdg) mutation in mice(20Powell J.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2798-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which involves a failure to make a normal skeletal muscle α1 DHPR subunit (21Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), and the skrrm1/skrrm1 mouse, which lacks a functional RyR1(22Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Regardless of the basis of the cn mutation, we believe it reasonable to attribute many, if not all, of the changes we have observed in the present studies to the absence of αRyR in cn/cn muscle.The switch from a Ca2+o-dependent to a Ca2+o-independent E-C coupling process in (+/?) muscle cells is similar to that observed for cultured neonatal rat skeletal muscle cells(23Cognard C. Rivet-Bastide M. Constantin B. Raymond G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 422: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The failure of cn/cn muscle cells to make this transition suggests that either αRyR protein or an activity associated with this isoform is required for this event. The data of Tanabe et al.(13Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) obtained with mdg/mdg muscle cells can be interpreted to indicate that the isoform of the α1 DHPR subunit (cardiac or skeletal) expressed is a determinant of whether Ca2+o-dependent or Ca2+o-independent coupling is used by cultured mdg/mdg mouse skeletal muscle cells. Our results suggest that the isoform of the RyR expressed is also important in this regard.In preliminary studies 4D. D. McKemy, J. A. Airey, and J. L. Sutko, unpublished observations. using Western analyses we have found that both the cardiac and skeletal muscle isoforms of the α1-DHPR subunit are expressed at days 3 and 7 in +/? and cn/cn chick muscle cells. The cardiac isoform is more abundant at day 3 than it is at day 7, whereas the skeletal muscle isoform is present at greater levels at day 7 than at day 3. Both the α and βRyRs are present at both days in +/? cells, while the βRyR is present in cn/cn muscle cells at these times. Thus, in +/? cells, each of the DHPR and RyR isoforms is present at appreciable levels when only a single type of coupling is observed. This suggests that while the DHPR and RyR isoform expressed may act as determinants of the type of coupling used, they may not by themselves be sufficient, and that other factors may also be necessary. Such factors could be those that direct the formation of the junctional structures required for DCCR and the localization of DHPR and RyR isoforms to these structures, as well as the expression of other triad junctional components. Studies to determine the relative distributions of the DHPR and RyR isoforms and cell morphological features at different times in culture are in progress.The observation of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+o-dependent Ca2+ transients in response to electrical stimuli and of Ca2+o-independent responses to caffeine indicates that the βRyR expressed in cn/cn cells is functional as a SR release channel and can be activated by external signals. Importantly, these results also indicate that an E-C coupling system consisting of only the βRyR is not sufficient to support Ca2+o-independent E-C coupling. This suggests that the βRyR may not be capable of the interactions necessary for the Ca2+o-independent process and that either the αRyR/skeletal muscle α1-DHPR subunit combination or both α- and βRyRs are necessary for DCCR.The on and off rates of Ca2+o-dependent Ca2+ transients are slower than those observed for the Ca2+o-independent events. These differences may be due to the activation mechanisms used, the channel properties of the RyR isoforms involved, the isoforms and density of the SR Ca2+ ATPase expressed, and the extent to which SR membranes are organized as they are in mature muscles.When indo-1 fluorescence signals were normalized using the fluorescence observed prior to activation, the Ca2+ transients observed in +/? and cn/cn cells were comparable in magnitude. This is again consistent with the results obtained with lower density cultures(19Airey J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. Ivanenko A. Kenyon J.L. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although indirect, these results suggest that the same calcium stores may be accessed by both RyR isoforms in these cells. They also suggest that if the α- and βRyRs operate in a two-RyR Ca2+ release system, the αRyR may influence the quantity of Ca2+ released by affecting the duration rather than the amplitude of the SR Ca2+ release transient.A second defect in E-C coupling that precludes activation of the βRyR-mediated Ca2+ release events becomes apparent in cn/cn cells by ~day 10 in culture. It is unclear whether this defect is related to the muscle cell degeneration that becomes apparent by day 12. This failure of electrical stimuli to activate the βRyR is not due to either an inoperative βRyR or an inability to maintain SR calcium stores, as caffeine produces a ryanodine-sensitive release of calcium that is undiminished in the absence of Ca2+o.As noted above, cn/cn chick and skrrm1/skrrm1 mouse skeletal muscle cells exhibit similar phenotypes. This is consistent with the absence of homologous RyR isoforms, αRyR and RyR1, respectively, in these cells. The sequence information available for bullfrog (9Oyamada H. Murayama T. Takagi T. Iino M. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Ogawa Y. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17206-17214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chick2αRyRs indicates that these proteins are most closely related to RyR1. This relationship is also supported by immunological data(5Lai F.A. Liu Q.-Y. Xu L. El-Hashem A. Kramarcy N.R. Sealock R. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C365-C372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that electrical stimuli elicited low amplitude contractions and caffeine produced significant contractures in skrrm1/skrrm1 muscle cells (see Fig. 4 of (22Takeshima H. Iino M. Takekura H. Nishi M. Kuno J. Minowa O. Takano H. Noda T. Nature. 1994; 369: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) indicating the presence of a non-RyR1-mediated Ca2+ release process. Northern(11Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V. Science. 1992; 257: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), PCR (29Ledbetter M.W. Preiner J.K. Louis C.F. Mickelson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31544-31551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in situ hybridization studies (28Giannini G. Conti A. Mammarella S. Scrobogna M. Sorrentino V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) indicate the presence of RyR3 in mammalian skeletal muscles. Moreover, chick and bullfrog βRyRs are most homologous to the mammalian RyR3 isoform2,3(9Oyamada H. Murayama T. Takagi T. Iino M. Iwabe N. Miyata T. Ogawa Y. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17206-17214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus RyR3 is a candidate as a second RyR in mouse muscle cells. These results suggest that both chick and mouse skeletal muscles may utilize two-RyR E-C coupling.The failure of cn/cn cells to develop coordinated whole cell contractions is at least in part related to an inability to form normal sarcomeres. A number of studies have indicated that some aspect of muscle cell activation promotes myofibrillar assembly(24Bandman E. Strohman R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Cerny L.C. Bandman E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2153-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Kidokoro Y. Saito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1978-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The poorly organized sarcomeres in cn/cn muscle cells suggest that Ca2+ transients having specific characteristics may be important for this event. The focal vesiculation-like contractions observed in cn/cn cells result from a spontaneous, repetitive, and localized release of SR Ca2+. The latter may be due to the presence of only a partial E-C coupling system and involve an inappropriate CICR. The final consequence of the cn mutation, the degeneration and death of cultured cn/cn muscle cells, is probably equivalent to the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle seen in cn/cn embryos(17Kieny M. Boutineau A.-M. Pautou M.-P. Goetinck P.F. Biol. Struct. Morphol. 1988; 1: 15-27PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that muscle cell activation and SR Ca2+ transients are important for maintaining skeletal muscle integrity and again that the underlying Ca2+ transients must have specific characteristics to be effective.In conclusion, a failure to make αRyR is associated with an inability to develop normal Ca2+o-independent E-C coupling and indicates that the αRyR is one determinant of the type of E-C coupling utilized in embryonic skeletal muscle cells. Moreover, the altered E-C coupling in cn/cn muscle cells suggests that normally a two-RyR system is utilized to couple excitation and contraction. The presence of E-C coupling and caffeine-induced contractions in skrrm1/skrrm1 muscle cells suggests that a two-RyR system may underlie E-C coupling in both nonmammalian and mammalian skeletal muscles. At the molecular level such a coupling system presents a new concept that may differ in a number of ways from those envisioned previously. The use of a two-RyR system provides additional complexities for the morphological, functional, and regulatory properties of the processes that underlie skeletal muscle activation. Two RyR isoforms are also co-expressed in avian cerebellar Purkinje neurons(27Ellisman M.H. Deerinck T.J. Ouyang Y. Beck C.F. Tanksley S.J. Walton P.D. Airey J.A. Sutko J.L. Neuron. 1990; 5: 135-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); thus, a two-RyR system for generation of cellular Ca2+ transients may be used in tissues other than skeletal muscle.

Williams A.J. Kenyon J.L. Grinsell M.M. Airey J.A. Sutko J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1834-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, both RyRs may serve as SR Ca2+ release channels. In vitro studies indicate that these RyRs may be regulated differentially by phosphorylation and calmodulin (7Airey J.A. Grinsell M.M. Jones L.R. Sutko J.L. Witcher D.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5739-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and have different ion channel properties(6Percival A.L. Williams A.J. Kenyon J.L. Grinsell M.M. Airey J.A. Sutko J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1834-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In particular, the chicken αRyR is activated by ATP to a relatively greater extent than by Ca2+, while the reverse is true for the βRyR channel. Such differences have also been reported for the two RyRs expressed in frog skeletal muscle(3Marayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Bull R. Marengo J.J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nonmammalian vertebrate αRyRs appear to be homologs of the mammalian skeletal muscle RyR isoform, RyR1, while the βRyRs are more closely related to the mammalian RyR, RyR32,3 (9). The latter RyR was initially cloned from the brain (10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) but appears to be expressed in a number of tissues, including skeletal muscle(10Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 11Giannini G. Clementi E. Ceci R. Marziali G. Sorrentino V.

Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).Our studies describe two aspects of the roles of the α- and βRyRs in striated muscles. The first concerns whether the RyRs are determinants of the type of E-C coupling used in embryonic skeletal muscle. The second aspect concerns the contributions made by each RyR in a two-RyR E-C coupling system. At least two E-C coupling mechanisms exist in striated muscles(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, Ca2+ entering the cell as L-type Ca2+ currents through dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) channels activates the cardiac RyR isoform (RyR2) channel resulting in a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). This type of coupling is defined experimentally by its dependence on Ca2+o(13Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 344: 451-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, DHPRs acting as voltage sensors are thought to interact with the RyR1 isoform, either directly or indirectly via an intermediary protein(s) in a voltage-dependent manner to cause a directly coupled SR Ca2+ release (DCCR)(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx is not required for DCCR and thus it is independent of Ca2+o. Recently, both DCCR and CICR mechanisms have been proposed to activate SR Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle(12Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Rios E. Pizarro G. News Physiol. Sci. 1988; 3: 223-227Google Scholar, 15Jacquemond V. Csernoch L. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 867-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this case the activating Ca2+ involved in the CICR mechanism is thought to be that released by DCCR rather than Ca2+ entering the cell. While the existence of CICR in skeletal muscle is controversial(16Pape P.C. Jong D.-S. Chandler W.K. Baylor S.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 295-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it is tempting to hypothesize that the αRyR is activated by DCCR, while the β isoform subserves a CICR mechanism.We have investigated these issues within the context of the recessive lethal cn mutation, in chickens, which results in an embryonic skeletal muscle dysgenesis, the failure to maintain skeletal muscles once they have formed, and ultimately the progressive degeneration of all skeletal muscles(17Kieny M. Boutineau A.-M. Pautou M.-P. Goetinck P.F. Biol. Struct. Morphol. 1988; 1: 15-27PubMed Google Scholar, 18Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Talvenheimo J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although we have not established the genetic nature of the cn mutation, there is a failure to make normal αRyR in cn/cn tissues, while cultured cn/cn muscle cells express normal levels of the βRyR(18Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Talvenheimo J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Airey J.A.

Thus, the use of +/? cells, which have a wild type phenotype, and cn/cn cells permits comparison of muscle cells expressing both α and βRyRs with ones expressing only the βRyR."

The RNA polymerase I transcription factor, UBF, activates transcription by binding to elements within the promoter and enhancer elements within the intergenic spacer but is not required for basal transcription. To assess the role of UBF in modulating ribosomal DNA transcription, we studied its expression in NIH3T6 fibroblasts when transcription was repressed in response to serum starvation and stimulated following refeeding. Our results demonstrate a correlation between the amounts of UBF protein and the rates of ribosomal DNA transcription in quiescent and serum-stimulated cells. Nuclear run-on assays and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the UBF gene was a primary response gene, exhibiting characteristics similar to those of c-myc and SRF. These results suggest that the regulation of transcription of the UBF gene by polymerase II represents a pathway by which cells modulate transcription by RNA polymerase I.

Mitotic cell growth requires continuous ribosome biogenesis to ensure that subsequent generations contain the ribosomes necessary to support protein synthesis. The more rapidly cells progress through the cell cycle, the more rapidly the process of ribosome biogenesis must occur(1Moss T. Stefanovsky V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paule M.R. Conoway R.C. Conoway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 83-106Google Scholar, 3Grummt I.

This process is frequently limited by the rate of transcription of the 45 S rRNA genes (rDNA), the precursor of 18, 5.8, and 28 S rRNA. Thus, the mechanism by which mammalian cells regulate transcription by RNA polymerase I is a question central to our understanding of the process of cellular growth. The RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF can activate transcription from the rDNA promoter by binding to elements within the promoter and to enhancer elements within the nontranscribed spacer(1Moss T. Stefanovsky V. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 2Paule M.R. Conoway R.C. Conoway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation.

The purified RNA polymerase I transcription factor(s) that directs this activity is referred to as either TFIC(13Mahajan P. Thompson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16234-16243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TIF-IA(14Schnapp A. Schnapp G. Erny B. Grummt I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5010-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by the laboratories studying this problem. These three factors may represent different biochemical preparations of the same factor. However, this remains to be established. In addition to this regulatory mechanism, we have demonstrated that upon serum deprivation, the phosphorylation of a second RNA polymerase I transcription factor, UBF, decreases, reducing its ability to activate rDNA transcription(5O'Mahony D.J. Xie W-Q. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, when cells are refed serum or presented with other growth stimuli, the phosphorylation of UBF increases in conjunction with the increase in rDNA transcription (5O'Mahony D.J. Xie W-Q. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1G. Owens and L. Rothblum, manuscript in preparation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that at least one of the mechanisms by which cells control rDNA transcription involves regulation of the activity of UBF. A corollary of this hypothesis is that in some cells this regulation involves pathways that lead to increases or decreases in the level as well as activity of UBF. Consistent with this model, we have noted that when L6 myoblasts were induced to differentiate, there were simultaneous decreases in the content of UBF and the rate of rDNA transcription. These were preceded by a decrease in UBF mRNA levels (7Larson D.E. Xie W.Q. Glibetic M. O'Mahony D. Persson R. Sells B.H. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7933-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The possibility that various cell types might exhibit alternative pathways by which UBF activity is regulated was then considered. To address this question, we measured the rates of rDNA transcription, the amounts of UBF protein and mRNA, and UBF gene expression in exponentially growing, quiescent (serum-starved), and stimulated (cells stimulated by the addition of 10% serum after starving) NIH3T6 cells. Here we present evidence that the amount of UBF in NIH3T6 fibroblasts decreases in response to serum starvation and that upon refeeding the level of UBF returns to original levels. Furthermore, the rate of accumulation of UBF mRNA when the cells are stimulated and the resistance of this increase to cycloheximide demonstrate that UBF is a primary response gene. The results of nuclear run-on assays confirm this conclusion. The rate of UBF mRNA synthesis increased 20-fold when cells were stimulated by serum as compared with the relatively low level observed in quiescent, subconfluent cells. In conjunction with previous studies(7Larson D.E. Xie W.Q. Glibetic M. O'Mahony D. Persson R. Sells B.H. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7933-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Xie W-Q. Rothblum L.I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the regulation of expression of the UBF gene (a gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II) represents a pathway by which cells modulate transcription by RNA polymerase I. NIH3T6 fibroblasts, 3 × 106 cells, were plated on 160-mm plastic tissue culture plates and grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 overnight in α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cells were to be serum-starved, the medium was replaced with α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% serum. After 3 days in low serum medium, quiescent fibroblasts were serum-stimulated by adding fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Nuclei were isolated, and nuclear run-on assays were carried out using equal numbers of nuclei as described previously(20Glibetic M. Larson D.E. Rothblum L.I. Sells B.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When rDNA transcription was to be measured, elongation was carried out for only 15 min. In vitro elongated, radiolabeled RNA was purified and hybridized to 5 μg of the mouse 45 S rRNA gene sequences (22Financsek I. Mizumoto K. Mishima Y. Muramatsu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3092-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) immobilized on nitrocellulose. When transcription from the UBF gene was to be measured, the assays included 250 μCi of [32P]UTP/5 × 106 nuclei, and elongation was carried out for 30 min. Transcription of the UBF gene was detected by hybridizing the transcripts (50 × 106 cpm/hybridization reaction) to 5 μg of immobilized p405rUBF(21O'Mahony D.J. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The radioactivity hybridized to the rDNA was detected by autoradiography and quantitated by either liquid scintillation spectrophotometry of the blots or laser densitometry of the autoradiographs. The lack of hybridization to control slots containing vector sequences (results not shown) demonstrated the specificity of the hybridization reactions. UBF1 and UBF2 protein levels were detected in cell lysates from exponentially growing, quiescent, and serum-stimulated fibroblasts as described(20Glibetic M. Larson D.E. Rothblum L.I. Sells B.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21O'Mahony D.J. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. of cell lysates (10 μg of protein) on 10% polyacrylamide gels, UBF protein was visualized by Western blot analysis using UBF-specific antibodies and goat, anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase as described (20Glibetic M.

RNA was isolated from exponentially growing, quiescent, and stimulated fibroblasts following addition of serum at the times indicated as described by Xie and Rothblum(23Xie W-Q. Rothblum L.I. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 324-329PubMed Google Scholar). In some instances the refed fibroblasts were also treated with cycloheximide (5 mg/ml) for the times indicated. RNA samples (20 μg) were denatured and separated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted to Zeta-Probe filters. To visualize the UBF mRNA, the blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe for UBF, p405rUBF, a cDNA clone for UBF1(21O'Mahony D.J. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3180-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), washed, and subjected to autoradiography and quantitated by laser densitometry. Elongation factor EF-1a mRNA sequences were detected using pHFBA13 (ATCC 37854). The probes used to detect c-fos and c-myc mRNAs were generously provided by Dr. R. Crawford (Howard Florey Institute, Melbourne, Australia). All probes were generated by random-primed labeling. The radioactivity associated with each specific mRNA was detected by autoradiography and quantitated by scanning densitometry. These studies were designed to investigate the regulation of UBF protein and mRNA levels during transitions in the rates of rDNA transcription and growth. As indicated in Fig. 1A, nuclear run-on assays confirmed that the rate of rDNA transcription was depressed in serum-starved, quiescent cells. When the fibroblasts were stimulated by the addition of serum, the rate of rDNA transcription increased over a period of approximately 12 h to that exhibited by exponentially growing cells. This relatively slow return to a normal rate of transcription suggested that the factor limiting the rate of rDNA transcription was not one with a rapid turnover. One of the likely candidates, Factor C∗, has a short half-life(12Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1987; 50: 873-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Brun R.P. Ryan K. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5010-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that the activity of this transcription initiation factor is the only component modulating the rate of rDNA transcription in response to serum stimulation. On the other hand, a second candidate, UBF, has been reported to have an apparent half-life of 24 h in L6 myoblasts(7Larson D.E. Xie W.Q. Glibetic M. O'Mahony D. Persson R. Sells B.H. Rothblum L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7933-7936Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This latter observation led us to examine the possibility of a correlation between the amount of UBF present in the fibroblasts and the rate of rDNA transcription. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the amount of UBF protein present in fibroblasts decreased significantly following the removal of serum from the culture medium (Fig. 1B, lanes1 and 2). Furthermore, when quiescent, subconfluent 3T6 cells were stimulated by the addition of serum, the amount of UBF protein increased to nearly normal levels after only 5 h (Fig. 1B, lane3). Twelve h after refeeding, the level of UBF was 50% greater than that found in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1B, lane4). The results from the Western blots and the nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that the rate of rDNA transcription paralleled the changes in the mass of UBF after stimulation of growth in response to serum. Northern blot analyses were performed to determine whether alterations in the cellular level of UBF mRNA could account for the changes in UBF protein that occurred in response to serum stimulation (Fig. 2). Analysis of the levels of UBF mRNA in serum-starved cells demonstrated a decrease in UBF mRNA (Fig. 2, lanes1 and 2). Following serum stimulation, the level of UBF mRNA increased relatively rapidly. Three h after serum stimulation, the amount of mRNA increased 4-fold compared with the level observed in quiescent cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 7-9). The level of UBF mRNA in the stimulated cells peaked by 6 h and was greater than that observed in exponentially growing cells. Twenty-four h after serum stimulation, the level of UBF mRNA returned to that found in exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2, compare the first and lastlanes). Interestingly, the increase in UBF mRNA did not require de novo protein synthesis as revealed by its resistance to cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 2A, lane6). Since the levels of UBF mRNA increased relatively rapidly and occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, we examined the possible correlations between the behavior of UBF and other primary response genes such as c-myc and c-fos. RNA was isolated from fibroblasts that had been serum-stimulated for short periods of time. These samples were then probed for c-myc and c-fos both to confirm that the fibroblasts displayed the classic primary response to serum deprivation and stimulation and to compare the magnitude and kinetics of their induction with that of UBF mRNA (Fig. 2B). The time course and magnitude of UBF mRNA induction more closely paralleled the pattern observed for c-myc mRNA than the pattern for c-fos (Fig. 2C). However, the maximum induction of UBF mRNA occurred 3-6 h after serum stimulation by which time the levels of both c-fos and c-myc had returned to that found in exponentially growing cells. The rate with which the level of UBF mRNA increased upon serum stimulation suggested that its accumulation resulted from an elevated rate of UBF gene transcription. We therefore carried out nuclear run-on assays to establish the relative rates of UBF mRNA synthesis in exponentially growing, quiescent, and serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 3). These assays revealed that in response to the withdrawal of serum the rate of synthesis of UBF mRNA decreased to 15% of that observed in exponentially growing cells. Furthermore, nuclei isolated from cells that had been stimulated by the addition of serum for 2 h synthesized UBF mRNA at a rate 20-fold greater than that observed in nuclei isolated from quiescent, subconfluent cells. These observations demonstrated that the increased cellular content of UBF observed in serum-stimulated cells resulted from increased rates of transcription of the UBF gene. Primary response genes are rapidly induced when quiescent, subconfluent cells are stimulated by the addition of growth-promoting factors, and this induction does not require de novo protein synthesis. The observation that the rise in UBF mRNA is an early event following serum stimulation and is resistant to cycloheximide supports the hypothesis that the UBF gene is a primary response gene(16Herschmann H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pattern of regulation of UBF mRNA is similar to those patterns demonstrated by other primary response genes such as c-myc, SRF (serum response factor), and fra-1(16Herschmann H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 17Dean M. Levine R. Ran W. Kindy M. Sonenshein G. Campis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9161-9166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While these genes are down-regulated in quiescent cells and transiently induced in response to serum, they are constitutively expressed in proliferating cells. The pattern of regulation of UBF mRNA reported here is most similar to that of SRF mRNA with regard to the degree of induction by serum and the effect of cycloheximide on this response(18Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Triesman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the continued accumulation of UBF mRNA after refeeding in the presence of cycloheximide, when rDNA transcription is turned off, suggests that the UBF gene is responding to the signal to resume rDNA transcription and not as a consequence of rDNA transcription. A consideration of these results argues that the increased rate of rDNA transcription occurring following serum stimulation is modulated by UBF rather than (or in addition to) Factor C∗ as has been suggested in other reports. The relatively slow recovery of rDNA transcription suggests that one or more of the components required for transcription must be accumulating during this period. Tower and Sollner-Webb (12Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Cell. 1987; 50: 873-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Factor C∗ activity recovers rapidly, within 1 h, after being down-regulated by cycloheximide. While this response may differ from the recovery of Factor C∗ activity after serum starvation and refeeding, our results suggest that it is unlikely that the rate of the rise in rDNA transcription upon serum stimulation solely reflects the accumulation of Factor C∗. The parallel increases in UBF protein and rDNA transcription suggest a cause and effect relationship. This interpretation is consistent with previous in vitro(24Smith S.D. Oriahi E. Lowe D. Yang-Yen H.F. O'Mahony D. Rose K. Chen K. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and in vivo observations(8Xie W-Q. Rothblum L.I. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 19Kuhn A. Voit R. Stefanovsky V. Evers R. Bianchi M. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that at least one mechanism by which cells mediate transcription by RNA polymerase I involves the regulation of transcription of the UBF gene by RNA polymerase II. On the other hand, when Chinese hamster ovary cells are serum-starved and refed the amount of UBF does not vary. Rather, the phosphorylation state, viz. activity, of UBF is increased when serum-starved cells are refed(5O'Mahony D.J. Xie W-Q. Smith S.D. Singer H.A. Rothblum L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 35-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would suggest multiple pathways for the regulation of UBF activity. Interestingly, these two pathways can coexist in the same cell type. We have found that primary cultures of neonatal cardiomyocytes utilize one or the other of these pathways in response to different hypertrophic stimuli. 3Hannan, R., Luyken, J., and Rothblum, L., J. Biol. Chem.270, in press. Thus, the existence of multiple, non-exclusive pathways for regulating the activity of UBF provides cells with a means to fine tune rDNA transcription in response to a wide array of stimuli."

To understand how the 5′ splice site of exon 18 contributes to splicing regulation, we have investigated the interaction of the U2AF65 splicing factor to pre-mRNAs that contained portions of the constitutive exon 17 or the alternate exon 18 fused to exon 19 and separated by a shortened intron. Despite sharing an identical 3′ splice site, only the pre-mRNA that contained a portion of exon 17 and its associated 5′ splice site displayed efficient U2AF65 cross-linking. Strikingly, a G → U mutation at position +6 of the intron, converting the 5′ splice site of exon 18 into that of exon 17, stimulated U2AF65 cross-linking. The improved cross-linking efficiency of U2AF65 to a pre-mRNA carrying the 5′ splice site of exon 17 required the integrity of the 5′ end of U1 but not of U2 small nuclear RNA. Our results indicate that neural cell adhesion molecule 5′ splice site sequences influence U2AF65 binding through a U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein/U2AF interaction that occurs at the commitment stage of spliceosome assembly, before stable binding of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Thus, the 5′ splice sites of exons 17 and 18 differentially affect U2AF65 binding to the 3′ splice site of exon 19.

Factors that modulate U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding to these 5′ splice sites may play a critical role in regulating exon 18 skipping. The first step of splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs occurs through cleavage at the 5′ splice site with concomitant joining of the intron 5′ end to the 2′ hydroxyl of a residue in the branch site region of the intron. The second step of splicing promotes the excision of the lariat intron and the ligation of the exons. In mammals, mutations at the invariant G1 and U2 positions of the intron allow branch formation, sometimes at a reduced rate, and often prevent the second step of splicing leading to the accumulation of lariat intermediate(1Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Mutations at other positions of the 5′ splice site reduce splicing efficiency and frequently promote the utilization of cryptic 5′ splice sites(1Green M.R. Annu. Rev.

In mammals, early pre-spliceosome complexes formed in the absence of ATP contain several factors including U2AF and U1 snRNP(11Michaud S. Reed R.

The U2 snRNP has also been detected in related complexes(14Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the formation of ATP-independent splicing complexes is more efficient when both 5′ and 3′ splice sites are present(13Michaud S. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the 5′ splice site is important in fixing the use of a 3′ splice site by mediating an interaction between U1 snRNP and U2AF(13Michaud S. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An interaction between U1 snRNP and U2AF has recently received support from the demonstration that members of the serine-arginine-rich family of splicing factors (e.g. SF2/ASF and SC35) can interact both with U2AF35(15Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and with the U1 snRNP-70 kDa protein (15Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 16Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). A network of interactions involving U1 snRNP-70 kDa/(SC35/SF2)/U2AF35/U2AF65 may therefore be critical to commit the use of a pair of 5′ and 3′ splice sites. On the other hand, 5′ splice site sequences downstream from a weak 3′ splice site have been shown to facilitate U2AF65 binding in a process that requires the participation of other factor(s)(17Hoffman B.E. Grabowski P.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2554-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, a similar network of interactions involving U1 snRNP and U2AF is possibly assembled across the exon to stimulate the use of a weak 3′ splice site. The pre-mRNA encoding the larger neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) is alternatively spliced to yield two mRNAs differing by the incorporation of a 801-nucleotide exon (exon 18)(18Barbas J.A. Chaix J.C. Steinmetz M. Goridis C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The 5′ splice site of exon 18 is a crucial element in the regulation of exon 18 skipping since its replacement with an α-globin 5′ splice site abolishes regulation(19Tacke R. Goridis C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1416-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, the use of the 5′ splice site of exon 18 is up-regulated in differentiating cells, even when placed in the context of an α-globin pre-mRNA(19Tacke R. Goridis C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1416-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in exon 18 skipping, we have investigated RNA-protein interactions on pre-mRNA substrates carrying various 5′ splice sites. We find that the 5′ splice site of exon 18 does not favor efficient U2AF65 binding to the 3′ splice site of exon 19. In contrast, a single mutation that converts the 5′ splice site of exon 18 into that of exon 17 improves the interaction of U2AF65 with the 3′ splice site, in a process that requires the U1 but not the U2 snRNP. pSPE consists of a PstI-TaqI fragment containing the 5′ splice site region of exon 18, followed by a SacI-EcoRI fragment containing part of exon 19 and the upstream intron. pSPD was obtained by deleting a HincII-SmaI fragment from pSPE17-E18-E19-553 (a pSP64 derivative containing the 5′ splice site of both exon 17 and exon 18 as well as the 3′ splice site of exon 19). Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)(20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The overlapping mutagenic oligonucleotides were (5′ to 3′): ed1, GAGAGGACGTACTCGGTCTT; eAd1, GAGAGGACTCACCCCGTCTTTGCTG; and the corresponding complements (ed2 and eAd2). The flanking oligonucleotides were: SP6, TTGTCGTTAGAACGCGGCTA; and Nf1, TTGCTTGGTACCCATCATGC. The first PCRs were carried out with 15 pmol of each pair of oligonucleotides (SP6-ed1, ed2-Nf1, SP6-eAd1, and eAd2-Nf1) in a 100-μl reaction containing 4 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.25 mM each dNTPs, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.01 μg of boiled pSPE, and 1 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The reactions were covered with mineral oil and incubated in a thermal cycler using the “touchdown” procedure(21Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). PCR-generated fragments from this first set of reactions were then used directly (10 μl) for a second round of amplification using flanking oligonucleotide primers. The mutagenized fragments were substituted into pSPE at the PstI-BamHI sites to give rise to pSPM and pSPW. The sequence of recombinant molecules was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pre-mRNA substrates were synthesized using the SP6 RNA polymerase from corresponding linear templates, in the presence of m7GpppG, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Boehringer Mannheim) and [α-32P]UTP(22Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. Vol. I. IRL Press, Oxford1994: 1-29Google Scholar). Full-length transcripts were gel-purified before use. Oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage was accomplished as described in Chabot (22Chabot B. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing: A Practical Approach. Vol. I.

To generate D3′ and E3′ RNAs, we used oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′ splice site regions (Ne9, ATCCCTCCTACTCCACGTAC; Ne10, TGGACAAAGAGAGGCCGTAC) Oligonucleotides complementary to nucleotides 1-12 and 1-14 of U1 and U2 snRNAs, respectively, were used to target snRNP inactivation. Nuclear extracts and S-100 were prepared according to Dignam et al.(23Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 11: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Extracts were depleted of endogenous ATP by incubation at 30°C for 30 min(11Michaud S. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 fmol of RNA substrates (50,000 cpm, Cerenkov) were incubated for 10 min, unless indicated otherwise, in a standard splicing reaction (24Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1985; 42: 725-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) without RNase inhibitors. A 5-μl aliquot was removed from each reaction, irradiated 20 min with UV, and digested with RNase A as described(25Zamore P.D. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cross-linking products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 9% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were scanned on a Corning 750 densitometer. U2AF purification was accomplished following a modification of the procedure described by Zamore et al.(7Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Following a washing step with Buffer A (20 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5 M KCl, the column was eluted with Buffer A containing 1 M KCl. The eluate was loaded directly on poly(U)-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia), and the column was washed with Buffer A containing 2.4 M KCl. U2AF was eluted with Buffer A containing 2 M guanidine hydrochloride and 100 mM KCl. The eluted fraction was dialyzed in Buffer B (Buffer A containing 20% (v/v) glycerol + 100 mM KCl). Depletion of U2AF was accomplished by loading a nuclear extract adjusted to 1 M KCl onto a poly(U)-Sepharose column as described previously(7Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 11: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Western analyses were performed as described(28La Branche H. Frappier D. Chabot B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4509-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As the 5′ splice site sequence of exon 18 plays an important role in fixing the frequency of inclusion of the alternate exon 18(19Tacke R. Goridis C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1416-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we wished to investigate whether this 5′ splice site influenced specific RNA-protein interactions. To address this question in vitro, we constructed simple NCAM substrates containing the 3′ portion of exon 18 with its donor splice site fused to the 5′ portion of exon 19 and its acceptor splice site (E RNA; Fig. 1). We also constructed a substrate containing the 3′ portion of the constitutive exon 17 with its respective donor splice site fused to the 5′ portion of exon 19 and its acceptor splice site (D RNA; Fig. 1). 32P-Labeled RNA substrates synthesized with bromodeoxyuridine were tested in a UV cross-linking assay in HeLa extracts. Under standard splicing conditions, the UV cross-linking assay revealed that E and D RNAs cross-linked to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, this protein cross-linked considerably more efficiently to D RNA. The same difference in the efficiency of cross-linking was observed in extracts incubated at 0°C (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), in extracts that had been depleted of endogenous ATP by preincubation at 30°C (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6), as well as in a HeLa S-100 extract (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). Notably, the length of the incubation period at 30°C affected the magnitude of the difference in the intensity of the 65-kDa protein cross-linked to E and D RNAs; the difference was clearly visible in a HeLa nuclear extract (H191) following a 4-min incubation at 30°C (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), but was considerably reduced or lost after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5, and C, lanes 7 and 8). The length of the incubation period at 30°C that yielded a maximal difference in the intensity of the 65-kDa band varied between different nuclear extract preparations (data not shown). A difference in the intensity of the 65-kDa band between D and E RNAs after 10 min of incubation could be obtained when the mixture was adjusted to 2.5 mM Na2EDTA (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). As the addition of Na2EDTA to splicing extracts allows spliceosome formation but prevents the first step of splicing(29Abmayr S.M. Reed R. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our result suggest that the 65-kDa protein preferentially associates with early assemblies. Thus, specific splicing complexes displaying differences in the interaction of the 65-kDa protein may be short-lived and chased into more advanced stages of assembly in which the 65-kDa protein is either not binding or binding with a similar efficiency.Figure 2:UV cross-linking to E and D RNAs in various extracts. A, cross-linking assays in splicing mixtures containing a HeLa extract (H191) were performed with E and D RNAs following an incubation of 4 min at 30°C (lanes 1 and 2), an incubation at 0°C (lanes 3 and 4), an incubation of 4 min at 30°C in an ATP-depleted extract (lanes 5 and 6) and in an ATP-depleted extract supplemented with exogenous ATP, creatine phosphate and MgCl2 (lanes 7 and 8). The position of molecular weight markers is indicated. B, cross-linking assays were performed following an incubation of 10 min with D and E RNAs in a HeLa S-100 and nuclear extract (H191). A purified U2AF fraction was also incubated with D RNA prior to cross-linking (lane 1). The position of U2AF65 and molecular weight markers is indicated. A band that may correspond to U2AF35 is detected in the purified U2AF fraction (lane 1). C, cross-linking assays using D, E, and A RNAs were carried out following a 10-min incubation at 30°C in the H191 extract (lanes 1, 6-8) and in the same extract adjusted to 2.5 mM EDTA (lanes 3-5). A HeLa extract depleted of U2AF by chromatography on poly(U)-Sepharose was used in lane 2. The position of U2AF65 and molecular weight markers is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several results suggested that the 65-kDa protein corresponds to U2AF65, a splicing factor that recognizes the polypyrimidine tract-AG of 3′ splice site sequences(6Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 207-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Hoffman B.E. Grabowski P.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2554-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Zamore P.D. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). First, the 65-kDa band apparently co-migrated with the cross-linking product obtained with a highly purified U2AF fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Second, the 65 kDa-cross-linking product was not detected in a extract depleted of U2AF by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Third, to address the possibility that this protein might be the 62-kDa hnRNP I/PTB protein, which shares with U2AF65 the ability to bind to 3′ splice site sequences(10Garcia-Blanco M.A. Jamison S.F. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1874-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Mulligan G.J. Guo W. Wormsley S. Helfman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25480-25487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed a Western blot analysis using anti-U2AF65 and anti-PTB antibodies (kindly provided by M. R. Green (Worcester) and M. Garcia-Blanco (Duke), respectively). The migration of the 65-kDa cross-linked product (Fig. 3, lane 4) precisely coincided with the position of U2AF65 detected using the anti-U2AF antibody (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast the anti-PTB antibody revealed a doublet band migrating significantly faster than the 65-kDa band (Fig. 3, lane 5). This analysis rules out PTB as the 65-kDa protein displaying differential cross-linking. Finally, two U2 snRNP-associated spliceosomal proteins of molecular mass similar to U2AF65 have been reported to cross-link to pre-mRNA (SAP 61 and SAP 62; (30Staknis D. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2994-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that SAP 61 and/or SAP 62 correspond to the 65-kDa protein that we detect since, in contrast to the 65-kDa protein, these proteins do not associate with pre-mRNA in extracts depleted of ATP(30Staknis D. Reed R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2994-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, the difference in cross-linking of the 65-kDa protein to D and E RNAs continued to be detected in extracts in which the U2 snRNP was inactivated (see below). To address whether the U2AF65 cross-linking signal resulted from binding to the 3′ splice site of exon 19, we used a shortened D transcript terminating a few nucleotides before the branch site region (D5′ RNA; Fig. 1). The decreased efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking to D5′ RNA (Fig. 4A, lane 3) suggests that the bulk of the U2AF65 cross-linking signal originated from binding to the 3′ splice site region of exon 19. In contrast, the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking to a shortened E transcript (E5′ RNA; Fig. 1) remained similar to that of E RNA (Fig. 4A, lane 4), indicating that U2AF65 cross-linked poorly to the 3′ splice site of E RNA but that it cross-linked with limited efficiency to other regions of the RNA. Thus, U2AF65 binds less efficiently to the 3′ splice site of exon 19 when it is paired with the 5′ splice site of exon 18. Alternatively, it is possible that U2AF65 binds to the 3′ splice site of E RNA but in a configuration that is less reactive to UV cross-linking. To address this question, we performed a cross-linking assay in the presence of E RNA as unlabeled competitor (Fig. 4B). If U2AF65 binds equally well to D and E RNAs, then gradual increases in the concentration of competitor RNA should cause an equivalent reduction in the intensity of U2AF cross-linked to D and E RNAs. Consequently, the amplitude of the difference in U2AF cross-linking should remain the same at all concentrations of competitor. The competition assay indicates that increasingly higher concentrations of competitor RNA promoted a more rapid decrease in the intensity of U2AF cross-linking to E than to D RNA; the difference in the intensity of U2AF band between D and E RNAs changed from 2-fold in the absence of competitor (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2 and 6) to 5-fold in the presence of 10-fold excess of competitor (compare lanes 4 and 8), and to more than 10-fold when the competitor was present in 25-fold excess (compare lanes 5 and 9). While a 25-fold molar excess of competitor promoted a 7-fold decrease in U2AF65 cross-linking to E RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 5), a 100-fold excess of competitor only induced a 4-fold reduction in U2AF65 cross-linking to D RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 11). These results are incompatible with the notion that U2AF binds equally well to both RNAs. Thus, our results indicate that the difference in the intensity of U2AF cross-linked to D and E RNAs represents a difference in binding. The above results suggest that the identity of the first half of the RNA molecule influences the binding of U2AF65 with the 3′ splice site of exon 19. This conclusion was confirmed by using D and E RNAs that lacked the first exon and 5′ splice site sequences (D3′ and E3′ RNAs; Fig. 1). In comparison to D RNA, the level of U2AF65 cross-linking to D3′ RNA was reduced and was nearly equivalent to the level obtained with E RNA (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). In addition and as expected, the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking to E RNA was not superior to the level obtained with E3′ RNA (Fig. 5A, lane 4). The 3′ splice site of exon 19 is therefore a poor binding substrate for U2AF65 and remains so when paired with a region that contains the 5′ splice site of exon 18. The direct contribution of the upstream 5′ splice site sequences to U2AF65 binding was demonstrated by using pre-mRNAs carrying 5′ splice site mutations. We specifically mutated the 5′ splice site of exon 18 at position +6 from G to U, converting it into the donor site of exon 17, which displays a better match to the consensus sequence (M RNA; Fig. 1). The 5′ splice site of exon 18 was also converted into the adenovirus major late L1 5′ splice site (W RNA; Fig. 1). Compared to E RNA, the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking to M and W RNAs was improved significantly (Fig. 5B, lanes 4-6). A time-course cross-linking assay revealed that U2AF65 was the protein that cross-linked to M RNA most efficiently at all times (Fig. 5C, lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13). In contrast, U2AF65 cross-linking to E RNA was clearly less efficient at early times but became nearly equivalent to the intensity obtained with M RNA after 6 min of incubation in this extract (Fig. 5C, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). These results suggest that U2AF65 can bind with some efficiency to E RNA but that U2AF65 binding to M RNA occurs more rapidly and is more efficient. Notably, the level of U2AF65 cross-linking to M and W RNAs remained inferior to that of D RNA (Fig. 5B, lanes 3-6) suggesting that the sequence surrounding the 5′ splice site of exon 17 also contributed to the interaction of U2AF65 with 3′ splice site sequences. Nevertheless, a single base change in the 5′ splice site of exon 18 was sufficient to alter the interaction of U2AF65 with the 3′ splice site of exon 19. Our results are also consistent with the possibility that U2AF65 cross-linked directly to the 5′ splice site of D RNA. However, we consider this possibility unlikely since a U at position +6 would base pair more efficiently with the 5′ end of U1 RNA thereby reducing the probability that this nucleotide interacts with other splicing factors at that stage of the splicing reaction. A highly purified U2AF fraction cross-linked with similar efficiency to D and E RNAs (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that other factors were required to yield the different cross-linking profile of U2AF65 with D and E RNAs. Oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H degradation of U2 snRNA in a HeLa nuclear extract, while quantitatively destroying the 5′ terminus of U2 snRNA and completely blocking splicing (data not shown and Fig. 6B, lane 4, respectively), did not abolish the difference in the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking to D and E RNAs (Fig. 6A, lanes 3-6). Likewise, no change in the efficiency of cross-linking was noted when the assay was performed in a HeLa S-100 extract (data not shown). As destroying the 5′ end of U2 snRNA prevents the interaction of U2 snRNP with the branch site(5Chabot B. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), our result indicates that stable U2 snRNP binding is not required to generate the distinct U2AF65 cross-linking profiles characteristic of D and E RNAs. Thus, the events responsible for the difference in U2AF65 cross-linking are established early, most likely before U2 snRNP stably binds to branch site sequences. The influence of 5′ splice site sequences on the interaction of U2AF65 suggested that U1 snRNP may play a role in modulating U2AF65 binding. We tested this possibility by performing a cross-linking assay in extracts in which the 5′ end of U1 snRNA was removed by oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion. When U1 snRNP was inactivated, as judged by snRNA analysis on gels and splicing assays (data not shown and Fig. 6B, lane 2, respectively), the cross-linking efficiency of U2AF65 to D RNA was reduced considerably, whereas U2AF65 cross-linking to E RNA was not affected (Fig. 6A, lanes 9-12). Notably, the U2AF65 cross-linking signal to D RNA in the U1 snRNP-depleted extract remained superior to the signal obtained with E RNA in mock-treated extracts (Fig. 6A, lanes 10 and 11). This result could be explained if residual amounts of intact U1 snRNPs in the treated extract were still able to stimulate U2AF65 cross-linking. Nonetheless, as the 5′ end of U1 snRNA is essential for U1 snRNP binding to 5′ splice site sequences(31Chabot B. Black D.L. LeMaster D.M. Steitz J.A. Science. 1985; 230: 1344-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), our results indicate that a U1 snRNP/5′ splice site interaction is required for efficient U2AF65 cross-linking to D RNA. We have shown that U2AF65 does not bind efficiently to the 3′ splice site of NCAM exon 19 in the absence of an upstream 5′ splice site. U2AF65 has been documented to bind to highly active 3′ splice sites containing a consensus polypyrimidine tract(7Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast, U2AF65 binds poorly to the weak 3′ splice site of exon 4 of preprotachykinin (17Hoffman B.E. Grabowski P.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2554-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) which is interrupted by purines (UUCAUCUCUUGUCAG) as is the 3′ splice site of NCAM exon 19 (UGUUUCUGUUUCUCUGCAG). Interestingly, we have shown that the identity of the upstream 5′ splice site can influence the interaction of U2AF65 with the NCAM pre-mRNAs. Whereas coupling the 3′ splice site of exon 19 with the 5′ splice site of exon 18 (E RNA) resulted in inefficient U2AF65 binding, a single mutation at position +6 of the intron of E RNA, converting the 5′ splice site of exon 18 (CGA/GUACGG) into the 5′ splice site of exon 17 (CGA/GUACGU), stimulated U2AF65 binding to the 3′ splice site of exon 19. A similar effect was obtained when the 5′ splice site of exon 18 was converted into the adenovirus L1 5′ splice site (GGG/GUGAGU). The improved interaction of U2AF65 with a substrate carrying the 5′ splice site of exon 17 required U1 snRNP binding to the 5′ splice site as the 5′ end of U1 snRNA was required for efficient U2AF65 binding. Thus, the 5′ splice site of exon 17, by displaying a better match to the consensus than the 5′ splice site of exon 18, may promote more efficient U1 snRNP binding, which in turn facilitates or stabilizes U2AF65 binding through a direct or indirect interaction between U1 snRNP and U2AF65. Alternatively, the U2AF/U1 snRNP interaction may incite base pairing between intron sequences flanking the 5′ splice site and sequences adjacent to the U2AF binding site. The G at position +6 of the 5′ splice site of exon 18, by not being base paired with the 5′ end of U1 snRNA, may strengthen this interaction leading to the destabilization of U2AF65 binding. An indirect communication between U1 snRNP and U2AF65 was recently uncovered in the case of the preprotachykinin pre-mRNA(17Hoffman B.E. Grabowski P.J. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2554-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, in this case, U1 snRNP binds to a downstream 5′ splice site which targets U2AF65 binding to the weak E4 3′ splice site through exon-bridging interactions. Improving the match to the consensus of the upstream 5′ splice site did not result in increased utilization of the preprotachykinin E4 3′ splice site(32Grabowski P.J. Nasim F.U. Kuo H.C. Burch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5919-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results have shown that improving the upstream 5′ splice site can promote more efficient U2AF65 binding to the NCAM E19 3′ splice site. We have not yet investigated whether this observation can be generalized to other pre-mRNA substrates. Recently, the 70-kDa protein of U1 snRNP was shown to interact with splicing factors SF2/ASF and SC35(15Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 16Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Moreover, SF2/ASF and SC35 can interact simultaneously with U2AF35(15Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), a protein which readily associates with U2AF65 in splicing extracts(7Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 25Zamore P.D. Green M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, the proposed U1 snRNP/U2AF interaction may be mediated through a U1 snRNP-70 kDa/(SF2/ASF:SC35)/U2AF35/U2AF65 bridge that may help define intron boundaries. The same network of interaction may also be initiated at a downstream 5′ splice site and be assembled over exon sequences to help recognition of a weak 3′ splice site. Several results suggest that the communication between U1 snRNP and U2AF65 on NCAM substrates occurs at an early step of spliceosome assembly, most likely at the level of commitment complex formation (complex E). First, the difference in the efficiency of U2AF65 cross-linking was observed in a S-100 extract, which does not form complexes that correspond to advanced stages of spliceosome assembly (A and B complexes; (33Krainer A.R. Conway G.C. Kozak D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and data not shown). Second, destroying U2 snRNP by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H digestion did not significantly affect the U2AF65 cross-linking profiles, indicating that the U1 snRNP/U2AF65 interaction occurs before U2 snRNP stably binds to the pre-mRNA to form complex A. Third, the difference in the U2AF65 cross-linking profiles was observed in ATP-depleted extracts, which form E but not A complexes(11Michaud S. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Previous studies have indicated that the presence of a 5′ splice site increases the efficiency of ATP-independent complex formation(13Michaud S. Reed R. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 14Jamison S.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with these observations and further demonstrate that the identity of 5′ splice site sequences can modulate, via U1 snRNP, the interaction of U2AF65 with 3′ splice site sequences at the commitment stage of spliceosome assembly. Despite substantial differences in U2AF65 binding, D, E and M RNAs were spliced with similar efficiencies in vitro (data not shown). While differences in the affinity of splice sites for splicing factors are not necessarily reflected in the rate of splicing of simple pre-mRNAs, dramatic effects can be observed when splice sites are in competition(34Reed R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a significant change in the in vitro splicing profile of a pre-mRNA carrying both exon 17 and exon 18 5′ splice sites was observed when the 5′ splice site of exon 18 was converted into that of exon 17. 2J. Côté, unpublished results. Tacke and Goridis (19Tacke R. Goridis C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1416-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have shown that the 5′ splice site of exon 18 plays a critical role in establishing regulated patterns of splice site selection in vivo. Thus, the molecular basis for exon 18 alternative splicing may hinge on the efficiency with which the 3′ splice site of exon 19 becomes associated with either the 5′ splice site of exon 17 or the 5′ splice site of exon 18 via a U1 snRNP/U2AF65 interaction. The higher frequency of utilization of the 5′ splice site of exon 18 in differentiated neuronal cells could be regulated by factors that increase the affinity of U1 snRNP binding to the 5′ splice site of exon 18 or, alternatively, by factors that decrease U1 snRNP binding to the 5′ splice site of exon 17. The recent demonstration that the splicing factor ASF/SF2 can recognize 5′ splice site sequences and favor U1 snRNP binding (16Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Lührmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 35Zuo P. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that differences in the expression and/or activity of ASF/SF2 or other serine-arginine-rich protein members play a crucial role in modulating U1 snRNP binding to these sites. Alternatively, differences in the complement of proteins associated with snRNPs in neuronal cells (e.g. B′ replaced by N; (37McAllister G. Roby-Shemkovitz A. Amara S.G. Lerner M.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) may change the specificity of 5′ splice site recognition. Our future studies will examine these possibilities. We thank H.

https://openalex.org/W2011958145,"Sequences of the α-subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the snake and mongoose contain several differences in the region between amino acids 183 and 200. Receptors from both of these species reveal resistance to the snake α-toxins presumably arising as a protective evolutionary mechanism. Sequence differences include the added glycosylation signals at residue 187 in the mongoose and at residues 189 and 111 in snake. Although previous observations with peptides and fusion proteins either synthesized chemically or in a bacterial expression system indicate that certain amino acid residues may contribute to the resistance, our findings with the intact receptor in an eukaryotic expression system indicate the major role for glycosylation. In this study, we show that addition of glycosylation signals gives rise to virtually complete glycosylation at the added sites, although heterogeneity of oligosaccharide processing is evident. By analysis of combinations of mutants, we document that glycosylation exerts the predominant influence on α-toxin binding. Substitutions at other residues are largely without influence as single mutations but appear to decrease affinity further in multiple mutants, particularly where the receptor is glycosylated at the 187 and 189 positions. Glycosylation exerts a major influence on the dissociation as well as the association rates of the α-toxin-receptor complex, suggesting that the decrease for α-toxin affinity is not simply a consequence of restricted diffusional access, rather glycosylation affects the conformation and stability of the bound complex."

Incubation of BER-40 and MDCK cells with low concentrations of C6 ceramide resulted in (i) a pronounced increase in BFA cytotoxicity as measured by the inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation and the inhibition of colony formation by BFA, (ii) a significant protection by BFA against ricin cytotoxicity, and (iii) an inhibition of bulk protein secretion by BFA in BER-40 and MDCK cells. Related sphingolipids including sphingosine, sphingomyelin, and lactosylceramide and other unrelated lipid second messengers such as arachidonic acid and 1,2-diacylglycerol did not elicit the protection of BER-40 and MDCK cells against ricin cytotoxicity by BFA. C6 ceramide was the most effective among the ceramides with different acyl chain lengths. Interestingly, dihydro-C6 ceramide, which lacks the trans double bond in the sphingoid base, had no effect. On the other hand, C6 ceramide did not enhance BFA sensitivity in BFA-sensitive Vero cells. The LD50 of C6 ceramide were similar in Vero and BER-40 cells. Fluorescence microscopic studies revealed that C6 ceramide induced the redistribution of β-COP from the Golgi membranes to a more dispersed localization in both BFA-sensitive and BFA-resistant cell lines, mimicking the effect of BFA.

That transcriptional activity of the apoA-I gene is reduced to 50% of control, whereas abundance levels of nuclear and total cellular apoA-I mRNA are increased 3-fold, implies more effective apoA-I mRNA maturation. To study hormonal effects on apoA-I RNA processing, we quantified mRNA precursors in control and T3-treated rats (50 μg/100 g body weight for 7 days). Northern blotting, amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA, and ribonuclease protection assays showed that the splicing pathway is branched, in that either intron 1 or intron 2 is removed first from the primary transcript, whereas intron 3 is removed last. In T3-treated rats, abundance levels of the primary transcript, the intron 1-containing precursor devoid of intron 2, the intron 2-containing precursor devoid of intron 1, the intron 3-containing precursor lacking both introns 1 and 2, and nuclear mRNA were 65, 183, 78, 195, and 268% of controls. Compared with control rats, the half-life of the intron 1-containing precursor, measured after injection of actinomycin D, was increased 2-fold in T3-treated rats. In contrast, half-lives of the primary transcript and the intron 2-containing precursor were similar in control and T3-treated rats. Ribonuclease protection assays revealed an RNA species extending from the transcription start site close to the 3′ end of intron 1. The abundance of this RNA fragment, probably representing a degradation product, was 2.5-fold higher in control than in T3-treated animals (p"

The ions are located a few angstroms below the membrane surface (Andersen et al., 1978), and they modify the electrostatic potential profile inside the membrane dielectric (Andersen et al., 1978; Flewelling and Hubbell, 1986a; 1986b). It has been shown by Bühler et al.(1991), Läuger (1991a), and Stürmer et al.(1991) that these ions affect the reactivity of membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase toward Na+ and K+. The authors concluded from experiments with fluorescent, potential-sensitive aminostyrylpyridinium dyes that TPP+ and TPB− affect the release of Na+ from and the binding of K+ to external sites of Na,K-ATPase. The authors therefore suggested that the external cation binding sites are formed as deep wells, i.e. K+ binds to and Na+ is released from “sites that are located inside the membrane dielectric” (Läuger, 1991a). Since the binding of Na+ at the cytoplasmic side of Na,K-ATPase caused relatively small changes in the fluorescence response, the authors concluded that the cytoplasmic sites are located close to the lipid/water interface (Läuger, 1991a).In the present work we applied biochemical techniques supported by measurements of conformational changes by eosin fluorescence to describe which partial reactions in the Na,K-ATPase reaction cycle are affected by lipophilic ions. The studies were performed with broken membrane Na,K-ATPase preparations; thus, the lipophilic ions had access to both sides of the membrane and their distribution in the membrane was not modified by a trans-membrane potential. To ease the understanding of the experimental design, the following reaction scheme is used as a frame of reference: E1P(Nam)⇀↽mNa0E2P⇀↽nKoE2PKnATP↑↓ADP Pi↑↓E1Nam⇀↽mNaiE1⇀↽nKiE1Kn⇀↽E2(Kn) SCHEME 1In this very simplified scheme, E1 denotes the form of Na,K-ATPase characterized by a high affinity to ATP and Na+, while E2 denotes the form with a high affinity to K+ but a relatively low affinity to ATP and Na+ (Glynn, 1985; Läuger, 1991b). The lower row of the scheme shows reaction of Na+ and K+ with the cytoplasmic sites, while the upper row illustrates reaction of cations with the extracellular sites. The phosphoenzyme E1P(Nam) has m occluded Na+ ions and reacts with ADP resynthesizing ATP. E2P binds K+ with a very high affinity, dephosphorylates, and forms an intermediate with n occluded K-ions, E2(Kn).The effect of lipophilic ions on the following partial reactions were studied: transitions between E2(Kn) and E1Nam were characterized using eosin fluorescence as an indicator of conformation (Skou and Esmann, 1983); the steps leading to formation of phosphoenzymes were studied in experiments where the pre-steady state time course of E32P formation was measured, and the individual phosphoenzyme forms were characterized in chase experiments with ADP or K+. The entire reaction cycle was characterized through measurements of the steady state (1Andersen O.S. Feldberg S. Nakadomari H. Levy S. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

Acta. 1983; 727: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) ATP and pNPP hydrolysis activity at varying concentrations of Na+ or K+ or both. The effects of lipophilic ions on the overall reaction are compared to their effects on the partial reactions. Preliminary results have been published (Klodos & Plesner, 1992).MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzyme PreparationNa,K-ATPase from bovine brain was prepared according to Klodos et al.(1975). Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney was prepared according to J⊘rgensen(1974) as modified by Jensen et al.(1984). Na,K-ATPase from shark rectal gland was prepared as described by Skou and Esmann(1979).The Na,K-ATPase activity of bovine brain, pig kidney, and shark rectal gland enzymes, measured at 37°C and under standard conditions (Ottolenghi, 1975, but without bovine serum albumin) were 4-5, 27, and 25 units•(mg of protein)-1, respectively. The maximum phosphorylation site concentrations, measured as described (Klodos et al., 1981), were 0.45-0.55 nmol•(mg of protein)-1 for the brain enzyme, 2.7 nmol•(mg of protein)-1 for the pig kidney enzyme, and 2.5 nmol•(mg of protein)-1 for shark rectal gland Na,K-ATPase.The protein amount was determined according to Lowry et al. (1951), as described by Jensen and Ottolenghi (1983a), using bovine serum albumin as standard.Measurement of Eosin FluorescenceThe experiments were performed in a SPEX Fluorolog-2 spectrofluorometer at 20°C, the excitation wavelength was 530 nm, the slit was 0.1 nm, and the light path was 1 cm. A Schott RG550 filter was used as emission cut-off filter.The fluorescence response of 0.5 μM eosin to binding of K+ and subsequently to addition of Na+ was measured in 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 10 mM EDTA buffer, pH 7.5, which favors a form of Na,K-ATPase with high affinity to eosin. The pH was adjusted with N-methyl-D-glucamine. The fluorescence of unspecifically bound eosin was measured in the presence of 375 μM ADP, which prevents specific binding of eosin (Esmann, 1992).TPPCl and NaTPB dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide were added to final concentrations of 300 and 50 μM, respectively (dimethyl sulfoxidefinal = 0.05%). The pig kidney Na,K-ATPase (30 μg of protein•ml-1) in 2 ml of buffer solution was thermostated and continually stirred. All additions were from hand-held Hamilton syringes. For further analysis, data were expressed in percent of the starting level of fluorescence in each individual experiment.Phosphorylation-Dephosphorylation ExperimentsThe experiments were performed at 0°C and pH 7.4 with 300 μg of protein•ml-1. TPP+ and TPB−, when present, were added from freshly prepared solutions in water at least 10 min prior to the start of the phosphorylation. The phosphorylation medium also contained 0.1 mM MgCl2, 30 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.4, at 0°C and varying [NaCl]. The phosphorylation was started by the addition of 25 μM [γ-32P]ATP. After varying periods of time, the reaction was either stopped by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 5%) or dephosphorylation was initiated by the addition of a chase. The chase contained NaCl, buffer, and MgCl2 in the same concentrations as the phosphorylation medium and, in addition, either unlabeled ATP (final concentration 1 mM), unlabeled ATP and KCl (final concentrations were 1 mM and usually 20 mM respectively), or unlabeled ATP and ADP (final concentrations 1 and 2.5 mM). The dephosphorylation was stopped by addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 5%) at the times indicated. The amount of acid-stabile E32P was determined according to Klodos et al.(1981), and the results are presented in the figures after subtraction of EP levels, obtained after dephosphorylation for 5 min. The values in the figures are the mean of at least three experiments ± S.E.Measurement of ATPase ActivityThe [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis was measured in 30 mM histidine buffer, pH 7.4, at 37°C in the presence of 3 mM ATP, 3 mM MgCl2, and [NaCl] and [KCl] given in the figures. 32Pi was determined according to Lindberg and Ernster(1956).Measurement of pNPP HydrolysisThe pNPPase activity was measured according to Ottolenghi(1975), but without bovine serum albumin in the incubation medium. The buffer was 30 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.5, at 37°C. The reaction medium contained 20 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM pNPP. The pNPPase activity was measured as function of [KCl] at a constant salt concentration of the medium, 150 mM, replacing KCl with choline chloride, NMGCl, or NaCl. Identical results were obtained with choline chloride and NMGCl. The experiments in the presence of both KCl and NaCl were performed with or without 100 μM ATP. The amount of the released p-nitrophenol was determined from the optical density at 410 nm.Data ProcessingThe data were analyzed using the computer program “Plot 5.31” written by Bliss Forbush III, Dept. of Cellular and Molecular Physiology, School of Medicine, Yale University, applying a linear or nonlinear least squares analysis.ReagentsATP and ADP were purchased as sodium salts from Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. ATP used in the phosphorylation experiments was converted to its Tris salt by chromatography on a Dowex 1 column (from Sigma), and [γ-32P]ATP was purified on DEAE-Sephadex G-25 (N⊘rby and Jensen, 1971). ADP was purified by chromatography on a Dowex 50W H+ column, and the eluate was adjusted to pH 7.1 at 20°C with 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) purchased as sodium salt from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, was purified by chromatography on Dowex 50W H+. The eluate was adjusted with Tris to pH 7.4 at 37°C. N-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMG) was purchased from Sigma. Eosin was obtained from Gurt, Chadwell Heath, Essex, UK. TPPCl and NaTPB were gifts from Dr. H.-J. Apell, Universität Konstanz, or purchased from Sigma. TPPCl and NaTPB were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide or in water. The water solutions of TPPCl and NaTPB were prepared on the day of the experiment. All other reagents were reagent grade.RESULTSThe description of the results follows the reaction : binding of Na+ and K+ to the dephosphoenzyme, phosphorylation, characterization of phosphointermediates, Na,K-ATPase and pNPPase activities, and, finally, a series of experiments aiming at clarification whether the effects of lipophilic ions are due to their charge. It should be noted that: 1) because of its higher partitioning into the lipid phase (Flewelling and Hubbell, 1986a, 1986b) TPB− was used in lower concentrations than that of TPP+, and 2) whenever K+ was present only the effect of TPP+ was tested, as TPB− is a strong chelator of K+ (Flaschka and Barnard, 1960).Interconversions between Dephosphoenzyme Forms: E1Nam↔ E2(Kn) TransitionConformational transitions of the Na,K-ATPase following cation binding to nonphosphorylated enzyme forms were monitored by eosin fluorescence according to Skou and Esmann(1983), who showed that the fluorescence of eosin specifically bound to the enzyme is higher than the fluorescence of eosin in the solution or of nonspecifically bound eosin. Specifically bound eosin was released from its high affinity binding site by the addition of ADP (Esmann, 1992). 375 μM ADP used in the reported experiments was more than sufficient to prevent specific eosin binding. The fluorescence level observed in the presence of ADP was equal to that measured in the presence of saturating K+, where E2(Kn), which did not bind eosin specifically, was the only form present. Neither TPP+ nor TPB− had any effect on the affinity of specific eosin binding measured as equilibrium eosin binding (not shown). Both ions affected eosin fluorescence: TPP+ caused an increase in the fluorescence of nonspecifically bound eosin, i.e. it increased the background fluorescence, while TPB− increased the quantum yield of the fluorescence only of specifically bound eosin (Fedosova and Jensen, 1994).In our experiments, specific eosin binding was induced by buffer (10 mM HEPES + 10 mM MES + 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 at 20°C). The subsequent addition of 4 mM Na+ did not result in an increase in fluorescence, indicating that already in the absence of Na+ the specific eosin binding was maximal. The difference between the level of fluorescence in the presence of buffer, Na+, or both, and the level in the presence of ADP was equal to the maximal fluorescence increase caused by the eosin binding to the enzyme (ΔFmax). ΔFmax corresponded therefore to the complete transition of the enzyme from eosin-bound E1 to the eosin-free E2 form.In the absence of Na+, the addition of K+ induced a decay of specific fluorescence which could be fitted adequately with a monoexponential function (Fig. 1, inset). The rate coefficient of the decay (kobs) and the equilibrium fluorescence decrease (ΔF/F0) were derived. ΔF/F0 versus [K+] was found to be a hyperbola: ΔF/F0 = (ΔFmax/F0)/(1 + K0.5,K/[K+]), where K0.5,K = 5.2 ± 0.9 μM (not shown). Similar values were previously found in different types of experiments (cf. Esmann, 1992). The rate coefficient of fluorescence decrease, kobs, in the same range of potassium concentrations, showed a linear dependence on [K+] (Fig. 1A) indicating a low affinity K+ binding.Thus, we observed the same contradiction between affinities estimated from equilibrium and transient experiments as described previously by Karlish et al.(1978) and Glynn and Karlish(1982), who proposed the following scheme to explain this discrepancy: E1+K+⇀↽KD,KE1K⇀↽k-1k+1E2K SCHEME 2They assumed that a low affinity K+ binding to the E1 form is followed by a conformational transition, poised heavily in favor of the E2 form (cf. reviews by Glynn(1985) and Glynn and Karlish (1990)). The rate coefficient of disappearance of the E1 form upon K+ addition is equal to kobs = k-1+ k+1/(1 + KD,K/[K+]) and becomes kobs = k-1+ k+1•[K+]/KD,K for [K+] ≪ KD,K. Glynn et al. (1987) showed that the time course of deocclusion and the conformational change are closely correlated. Thus, k-1 in the model is the rate constant for K+ deocclusion from the intracellular sites.In our experiments, the rate coefficient of the specific eosin fluorescence decrease in response to K+, kobs, displayed a linear dependence on [K+] (Fig. 1A). The rate constant k-1 for the E2→ E1 transition was estimated to be 0.03 ± 0.012 s-1 by extrapolation of the straight line to 0 [K+]. It is in agreement with the data on deocclusion and conformational transition rate constants measured by different techniques (Glynn, 1985; Glynn et al., 1987).Since KD,K = K0.5,K•(k+1/k-1), and as k+1 is about 300 s-1 (Steinberg and Karlish, 1989) and k-1 = 0.03 s-1, an approximate value of the dissociation constant for K+, KD,K, was estimated to be in the millimolar range.When 4 mM Na+ was present, i.e. the starting point was E1Nam, K+ addition was also followed by a monoexponential decay. The rate constant k-1 for the K+ deocclusion was unchanged, but the slope of kobs versus [K+] was decreased by a factor of 80 (Fig. 1B) and the K0.5,K value obtained from equilibrium measurements was 421 μM (Fig. 2). The simplest reaction scheme compatible with these results is E1Na⇀↽KD,NaE1⇀↽KD,KE1K⇀↽k-1k+1E2K SCHEME 3Figure 2:Equilibrium fluorescence change as function of K+ in the presence of 4 mM NaCl. Eosin fluorescence was measured in 4 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, and different concentrations of K+ in the absence (circles) or in the presence of 300 μM TPP+ (squares). Eosin fluorescence upon addition of K+ is expressed as percentage of the starting level of fluorescence. The values are the mean of three experiments ± S.E. The curve is a fit of the experimental data to the equation: ΔF/F0 = (ΔFmax/F0)/(1 + K0.5,K/[K+]), as described under “Materials and Methods.” The K0.5,K = 421 ± 0.9 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In this model, Na+ and K+ compete for the binding to the E1 form, but neither the K+ occlusion, defined as E1K to E2K transition, nor deocclusion are affected by Na+. TPP+ had no effect on the K+ binding in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2).The experiments on Na+ binding in the absence of K+ were performed at low buffer concentration (1 mM HEPES + 1 mM MES) where no specific eosin binding was observed. It has been previously shown that in low ionic strength medium the enzyme has the characteristics of an E2 conformation (Skou and Esmann, 1980; Glynn and Richards, 1982; Jensen and Ottolenghi, 1983b; Klodos and Ottolenghi, 1985). Na+ addition to the medium was followed by a fluorescence increase which reflected the formation of the sodium-bound form of the enzyme. Neither TPP+ nor TPB− affected the Na+ dependence of the specific fluorescence increase (not shown). Thus, TPP+ affected neither Na+ nor K+ binding nor K+ deocclusion.Formation of PhosphoenzymeThe amount of EP was measured after a 2-s phosphorylation period at NaCl concentrations varying from 0 to 100 mM. We reported previously a marginal effect of the lipophilic ions on the formation of phosphoenzyme under these conditions (Fig. 2 in Klodos and Plesner(1992)).When the ionic strength was kept constant with NMGCl or TrisCl, no effect of lipophilic ions on the formation of EP was observed (Fig. 3). The same result was obtained when ionic strength of the medium was increased by addition of 100 mM NMGCl or 100 mM TrisCl (not shown). Tris+ decreased the apparent affinity to Na+, and the Na+ dependence curve became S-shaped. The half-saturating [NaCl] in the presence of TrisCl was 2.7 ± 0.12 mM (n = 6), and only 0.33 ± 0.02 mM (n = 6) with NMGCl in the medium. With 100 mM NMGCl, in the absence of added NaCl, 4-12% of the enzyme was phosphorylated (not shown), but it is not clear whether this phosphorylation was caused by NMG+ itself or by traces of Na+.Figure 3:Effect of TPP+ and TPB− on the formation of phosphoenzyme. Bovine brain Na,K-ATPase was incubated for 10 min at 20°C in 30 mM imidazole buffer (pH 7.4 at 0°C), 0.1 mM MgCl2, and varying [NaCl] and [NMGCl] (left panel) or [NaCl] and [TrisCl] (right panel), in the absence of lipophilic ions (circles) and in the presence of 300 μM TPP+ (squares) or 33 μM TPB− (triangles). The sum of [NaCl] and [NMGCl] or [TrisCl] was 100 mM. The samples were subsequently cooled to 0°C. 25 μM [γ-32P]ATP (final) was added, while concentrations of other components remained unchanged. The enzyme was phosphorylated at 0°C. After 2 s, the phosphorylation was stopped and the amount of phosphoenzyme was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The figure shows the amount of phosphoenzyme formed at 0-10 mM NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Na-dependent DephosphorylationNa+-dependent dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme was examined in the absence of ADP or KCl. The experiments were performed at 10-300 mM NaCl, and the chase contained 1 mM unlabeled ATP. The Na+ dependence of the dephosphorylation rate coefficients, obtained by a monoexponential fit of the dephosphorylation data, is shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4:Effect of lipophilic ions on Na-dependent dephosphorylation.

The stimulation appears to be due to a stimulation of dephosphorylation of the K-sensitive EP. It has been shown previously that the K-insensitive EP dephosphorylates directly (N⊘rby at al., 1983), and its transition to the K-sensitive EP is inhibited by NaCl (Klodos et al., 1994). However, because of a low relative amount of K+-insensitive EP (less than 12% of the total EP, Fig. 9), neither of the two processes could significantly affect the dephosphorylation of this phosphoform. Thus, NaCl stimulation of the Na+-dependent dephosphorylation was due to Na+ acting as a replacement, albeit poor, for K+ in activating the dephosphorylation of K-sensitive EP. As shown in Fig. 4, the rate coefficient of Na+-dependent dephosphorylation was increased by 33 μM TPB− at [NaCl] lower than 150 mM, whereas it was decreased by 300 μM TPP+ at all NaCl concentrations.Figure 9:TPP+ effect on K+-stimulated dephosphorylation of bovine brain Na,K-ATPase. The experiments were performed as in Fig. 8 with bovine brain Na,K-ATPase at varying [NaCl] in the absence (circles) or in the presence of 300 μM TPP+ (squares). [KCl] in the chase was 20 mM (final). A biexponential function EPt= EPO,K-sens•exp(-kfast•t) + EPO,K-insens•exp(-kslow•t) was fitted to the data like those in Fig. 8 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The relative amount of K-insensitive phosphoenzyme, EPO,K-insens, the rate coefficient of the decay of EPK-insens, kslow, and the rate coefficient of the decay of EPK-sens, kfast, are shown as function of [NaCl] in panels A, B, and C, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ADP-dependent DephosphorylationNeither TPP+ nor TPB− in concentrations up to 600 μM and 100 μM, respectively, influenced the steady state EP level at [NaCl] ≥ 10 mM (not shown). In a series of experiments, EP was formed in the presence of 10 to 500 mM NaCl with or without lipophilic ions for 60 s and subsequently chased with 2.5 mM ADP.The addition of ADP in the chase produced rapid decay of the ADP-sensitive EP and exposed the slowly decaying ADP-insensitive EP (Fig. 5A).

EPADP-sens and EPADP-insens are not synonymous with the classical ADP-sensitive, K-insensitive E1P or the ADP-insensitive, K-sensitive E2P, but signify operational quantities of phosphoforms characterized by their, rapid or slow, decay. kb1 is the rate coefficient of ADP-dependent decay, kf2 and kb2 are the rate constants of forward and backward transitions between the ADP-sensitive and the ADP-insensitive phosphointermediates, and kf3 is the rate coefficient of dephosphorylation of the ADP-insensitive EP. The forward transition is accompanied by dissociation of at least 1 Na+ (Yoda and Yoda, 1987; Glynn, 1988; J⊘rgensen, 1991, 1994; Goldshleger et al., 1994). Both the backward transition, accompanied by the binding of NaCl (Post et al., 1975; N⊘rby et al., 1983; N⊘rby and Klodos, 1988), and the dephosphorylation of the ADP-insensitive phosphointermediate, reflected by the rate coefficient of the Na+-dependent dephosphorylation (Fig. 4) (Klodos et al.(1981); cf. N⊘rby and Klodos (1988)), are dependent on [NaCl]. The rate coefficient of the decay in the slow phase is equal to the sum of kb2 and kf3.In the absence of lipophilic ions, an increase in [NaCl] resulted in: 1) an increase in the steady state amount of ADP-sensitive EP (Fig. 5, A and B), and 2) an increase in the rate of the slow decay (Fig. 5C). Both observations are in agreement with previously published data (Hara and Nakao, 1981; N⊘rby et al., 1983; Klodos and N⊘rby, 1987).TPP+ caused a large decrease in both the steady state amount of ADP-sensitive EP and in the rate of the slow phase at all NaCl concentrations (Fig. 5). The opposite was seen with TPB−, which caused a somewhat smaller, but significant, increase in both the steady state amount of EPADP-sens and a significant increase in the slope of the slow phase (Fig. 5). In other words, the effect of TPP+ was similar to that of a decrease in the concentration of NaCl and the effect of TPB− to an increase in [NaCl].Similar effects of lipophilic ions were observed in experiments with Na,K-ATPase from pig kidney (Fig. 6) and shark rectal gland (not shown). Although the steady state proportion of ADP-sensitive EP measured, in the presence of 100 mM NaCl in the medium, was lower with these enzymes than with brain Na, K-ATPase (compare Figure 5:, Figure 6: at 100 mM NaCl, cf. also Klodos & N⊘rby(1987) and Klodos et al.(1994)), qualitative effects of lipophilic ions on both the steady state level of ADP-sensitive EP and the slope of the slow phase were the same as with the brain Na,K-ATPase.Figure 6:ADP-stimulated dephosphorylation of pig kidney Na,K-ATPase: effect of lipophilic ions.

IFNγR-IgG3 bound IFNγ in solid phase assays and ligand blots, competed for the binding of radiolabeled IFNγ to the cell surface receptor of Raji cells, and inhibited the IFNγ-mediated antiviral activity with an efficiency at least one order of magnitude higher than that of the soluble receptor produced in the same expression system. Two IFNγR-IgG3 fusion proteins bound two IFNγ dimers forming a complex of approximately 380 kDa. In immunodiffusion assays, the IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein did not precipitate IFNγ.

Inoculum cells were cultivated in roller bottles using a mixture of Dulbecco's, Ham's F12, and Iscove's powdered media (25:25:50) with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Additional medium supplements included insulin, transferrin, Pluronic F68, and Primatone RL, an enzymatic meat hydrolysate (Sheffield Products). Batch fermentations were performed in stirred tank and airlift bioreactors of up to 100 liters working volume. Cell-free supernatants were harvested by continuous centrifugation (Varifuge 20RS, Heraeus, Germany). Protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine hydrochloride, were added to the culture supernatants after harvesting and to all buffers (except for the buffer used in the last purification step) to a final concentration of 1 mM and 10 mM, respectively. The culture supernatant was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration using an Amicon SP20 ultrafiltration system. The concentrated supernatant was mixed with 50 ml of Protein G-Sepharose equilibrated with 15 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl (PBS) and stirred gently at 4°C overnight. The protein solution was separated on a column from the gel, which was washed with five column volumes each of PBS and 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 5.0. The fusion protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 3.0 and was neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and loaded onto a 25-ml DEAE-Sepharose column (2.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The ion exchanger was washed with 10 volumes of 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and the fusion protein was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 3.0. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded onto a Superose-12 column HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) developed with PBS at 0.5 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS- and native-PAGE before pooling. The solid phase IFNγ binding assays, the ligand blots, the competition of binding of radiolabeled IFNγ to the cell surface receptor of Raji cells assays, and the inhibition of the IFNγ-mediated antiviral activity assays were performed as reported(10Garotta G.

The kinetics of IFNγ dissociation from sIFNγR, IFNγR-IgG3, or anti-IFNγ monoclonal antibody γ69 were performed according to Evans et al.(39Evans T.J. Moyes D. Carpenter A. Martin R. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cohen J. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 203Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, 20 μg of sIFNγR (carrying one binding site), 40 μg of IFNγR-IgG3 (two binding sites), or 40 μg of γ69 (two binding sites) were incubated with 1 μg of IFNγ containing 200 ng of 125I-IFNγ (3 × 106 cpm) in PBS in ice for 20 min. Unbound 125125I-IFNγ was separated on a Superose-12 column developed with PBS. The 125125I-IFNγ complexes in 750 μl were treated with 15 μg of unlabeled IFNγ at room temperature. At different times, 100-μl aliquots of complexes between IFNγ and IFNγR-IgG3 or γ69 were withdrawn and were added to 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads, whereas complexes between IFNγ and sIFNγR were added to 50 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads saturated with anti-IFNγR polyclonal antibody 3891, in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum. After incubation for 4 min with gentle agitation, the beads were separated by filtering the sample through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore Corp.). The radioactivity of the filtrate and of the beads was measured in a γ-counter. The time required for quantitative precipitation of the complexes (4 min) was added to the overall incubation time. Amino acid composition analysis was performed according to a modified method of Spackman et al.(40Spackman D.H. Stein W.H. Moore S. Anal.

Soluble IFNγ receptor produced in insect cells (12 μg) and fusion protein (6 μg) in 1.2 ml of PBS were kept at 37°C or were heated at 95°C. At various times, 100-μl samples were withdrawn and kept in ice until they were analyzed for residual ligand binding capacity by ligand blots. Digestion of 1 μg of protein substrate in 1 ml of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence or in the absence of 8 M urea, was performed as described(42Fountoulakis M. J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Two fusion proteins were constructed by fusing cDNA sequences encoding the extracellular domain of the human IFNγ receptor to sequences encoding parts of the human IgG γ1 or IgG γ3 heavy chains, including the hinge and constant regions CH2 and CH3. The construction of the eukaryotic expression vectors will be described elsewhere.2 Transfected CHO cells were grown in the presence of 2-5% FBS, and the fermentation conditions were not optimized. Because the fusion proteins include cysteine residues of the hinge and constant domains of the IgG1 and IgG3 chains, they should have been produced as covalently linked homodimers. However, this happened only with the IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein, whereas IFNγR-IgG1 was produced as a mixture of single chain and covalently linked homodimer in a ratio of approximately 2:1. The reasons for this discrepancy are under investigation. The purification and characterization of the IFNγR-IgG1 fusion protein was not followed further in this study. IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein was secreted into the culture medium, which was separated from the cells by centrifugation and concentrated by ultrafiltration. IFNγR-IgG3 was purified in three chromatographic steps, comprising (i) Protein G-Sepharose, (ii) DEAE-Sepharose, and (iii) size exclusion chromatography. Protein G is a Type III Fc receptor that binds to the Fc region of IgG. For binding to Protein G, both chains of the fusion protein are required. IFNγR-IgG3 recovered from Protein G-Sepharose was contaminated with bovine IgG, which was present in the FBS used for cell culture (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 8). When the FBS was passed through a Protein G-Sepharose column before fermentation, the amount of bovine IgG co-eluted with the human fusion protein was significantly reduced, but it was not completely eliminated (not shown). On nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the fusion protein migrated at approximately 175 kDa. Under the same conditions, bovine IgG co-migrated with IFNγR-IgG3, so that a discrimination between these proteins was not possible (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-5). Under reducing conditions, the proteins could be clearly discriminated, since bovine IgG was resolved in heavy and light chains of 50 and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A, lanes 6 and 8-10; the light chain co-migrated with the front on 7.5% SDS gels and is not seen), whereas the hybrid protein gave rise to a 90-kDa band corresponding to a single fusion chain (Fig. 1A, lanes 8-10). Chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, following the Protein G-Sepharose step, removed most of the bovine IgG, eluted at pH 4.5. The fusion protein was eluted at pH 3.5 and 3.0, and it still included small amounts of bovine IgG (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 9). Size exclusion chromatography, which followed the ion exchanger step, delivered two protein peaks, a and b, corresponding to proteins of apparent molecular masses 600 and 160 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). The protein bands of the fractions of peak a barely entered the native gel (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). When these fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, the proteins co-migrated with the fusion protein of peak b (Fig. 2C, lanes 7-9), indicating that peak a included oligomeric forms of IFNγR-IgG3 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-4). The oligomeric forms were noncovalently linked (nonreducing SDS-PAGE is not shown). The SDS-PAGE analysis additionally revealed the presence of bovine IgG in the fractions of peak a (Fig. 2C, lanes 2-4; the 55-kDa band). Peak b comprised highly purified fusion protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 8-10, and Fig. 2C, lanes 7-9), still contaminated, however, with approximately 2% bovine IgG (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 10). A second size exclusion chromatography cycle of the fusion protein of peak b yielded a more than 99% pure fusion protein preparation with less than 1% bovine IgG (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-3 and 5-6). The overall recovery was approximately 60%, as judged by ligand blots. The described method did not completely remove bovine IgG. Bovine IgG was completely removed when Protein G-pretreated FBS was used for cell culture and the fusion protein was purified following the described purification scheme over Protein G-Sepharose, DEAE-Sepharose, and sizing steps (data not shown). Amino acid sequence analysis from the N-terminal end revealed that the protein was processed properly and that the signal peptide sequence was cleaved off. The protein was heterogeneous at the N terminus since 50% of the molecules started with Glu-Met-Gly-Thr-Ala-Asp- and the rest with Gly-Thr-Ala-Asp-. Amino acid composition analysis showed that the protein had the expected composition. A molecular mass of 114 kDa was calculated for IFNγR-IgG3 (comprising the two covalently linked chains). Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a molecular mass of approximately 160 kDa for the fusion protein, suggesting that it exists as monomer in physiological buffer. The difference between the apparent and calculated mass is caused by glycosylation. 3Mesa, C., Dembic, Z., Garotta, G., and Fountoulakis, M.(1995) J. Interferon Res., in press. In immunoblots, the fusion protein was detected by specific antibodies raised against the native IFNγR. In immunodiffusion assays on agarose, the fusion protein was precipitated by the polyclonal antibody R3891 but not by the monoclonal γR99 (data not shown). IFNγR-IgG3 retained full ligand binding capacity when incubated at 37°C for 8 days and 20% of its activity when treated at 95°C for 1 h, as judged by ligand blots. The ligand binding capacity of the fusion protein decreased after 10 freezing-thawing cycles to approximately 10% of the original value and then remained constant for up to 30 cycles. The resistance of IFNγR-IgG3 to proteolysis in vitro was similar to that of sIFNγRs (42Fountoulakis M. J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 43Fountoulakis M. Gentz R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 1143-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) during folding and in the folded state (data not shown). IFNγR-IgG3 bound IFNγ on solid-phase and protein blot assays (not shown). The bivalent IFNγR-IgG3 inhibited the 125125I-IFNγ binding to the natural receptor of Raji cells with an IC50 of approximately 0.17 nM (Fig. 3A). The molecular mass of the IFNγR-IgG3 was considered to be 114 kDa (glycosylation was not taken into account). Under the same conditions, unlabeled IFNγ also competed with an IC50 of 0.20 nM, whereas the monoclonal antibody γ69 competed with an IC50 of approximately 1.2 nM (Fig. 3A). Thus, the fusion protein competed at least one order of magnitude more efficiently (IC50 = 0.17 nM) in comparison with the sIFNγR produced in CHO cells (IC50 = 2.3 nM) (Fig. 3A) and the sIFNγRs produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells (IC50 = 8 nM) (27Gentz R. Hayes A. Grau N. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H.-W. Ozmen L. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or in E. coli (IC50 = 15 nM)(25Fountoulakis M. Juranville J.-F. Stüber D. Weibel E.K. Garotta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In inhibition of the cell cytopathic effect (Fig. 3B), IFNγR-IgG3 performed approximately 20-fold more efficiently (IC50 = 1.20 nM) than the sIFNγR from CHO cells (IC50 = 23 nM). In comparison, γ69 inhibited with an IC50 of 0.05 nM (Fig. 3B). We investigated the exchange rate of IFNγ bound by IFNγR-IgG3 and for comparative reasons by sIFNγR and anti-IFNγ antibody γ69. The kinetics of dissociation were studied by mixing radiolabeled IFNγ with either of the three proteins, adding the excess of unlabeled IFNγ, and measuring the time-dependent release of the iodinated ligand. IFNγ complexed with IFNγR-IgG3 was released approximately 2-fold more slowly in comparison with that complexed with γ69 or the sIFNγR (Fig. 4). Table 1 summarizes the performance of the three proteins in ligand binding. The increased retention time may be essential if IFNγR-IgG3 will be used as antagonist of endogenous IFNγ. Similarly, the better performing in vivo tumor necrosis factor receptor p55 fusion protein had a significantly slower exchange rate for bound tumor necrosis factor α in comparison with the p75 fusion protein(39Evans T.J. Moyes D. Carpenter A. Martin R. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cohen J. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 203Google Scholar).Table I Open table in a new tab After reduction, IFNγR-IgG3 did not show IFNγ binding activity on ligand blots. Controlled reduction of the 175-kDa fusion protein resulted in generation of a 90-kDa single-chain species with IFNγ binding capacity suggesting that the four disulfides of the extracellular domain of the IFNγR, all of which are essential for ligand binding(44Fountoulakis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7095-7100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Stüber D. Friedlein A. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H.-W. Garotta G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2423-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are more stable than the disulfides connecting the two IgG3 heavy chains. Dialysis of the completely reduced fusion protein resulted in partial reconstitution of the biological activity of the 90-kDa single chain species only, but not of the 175-kDa IFNγR-IgG3. Thus, the disulfide bonds of the IFNγR domain of the fusion protein were reconstituted, whereas the disulfides between the two IgG3 constant domains were not formed (data not shown). We investigated the stoichiometry of binding between IFNγR-IgG3 and IFNγ by native gels, gel filtration, amino acid composition analysis, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The components were mixed taking into consideration a molecular mass of 114 kDa for the fusion protein and 32 kDa for IFNγ, since this cytokine exists as a dimer in physiological buffer(41Fountoulakis M. Zulauf M. Lustig A. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on data of native gel analysis of different ligand-fusion protein ratios, IFNγR-IgG3 and IFNγ were mixed at a ratio of 1:1, and the complex was chromatographed on a size exclusion column. An apparent molecular mass of approximately 400 kDa was found for the complex (Fig. 5A). The complex, as eluted from the sizing column, as well as the nonmixed components were subjected to amino acid composition analysis. The observed amino acid ratios of the components and of their complex were introduced into a computer program(46Antoni G. Presentini R. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and an IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein-IFNγ dimer molar ratio of 1:1 was found. Analytical ultracentrifugation delivered for the complex an apparent molecular mass of 380 kDa. Taking into consideration the results of the four analytical approaches, we conclude that IFNγR-IgG3 and IFNγ dimer interact at a molar ratio of 1:1 and that in physiological buffer they form a complex consisting of two IFNγR-IgG3 molecules and two IFNγ dimers ((2 × 160) + (2 × 32) = 384; the glycosylated fusion protein was detected as a 160-kDa species by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation). The apparent molecular mass values of the complexes determined by the different approaches are in good agreement with each other. The minor deviations may be caused by the high glycosylation grade of the fusion protein (approximately 60 kDa). We further studied whether the fusion protein and IFNγ dimer form complexes larger than the 380-400-kDa complex detected by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. IFNγR-IgG3 and IFNγ were mixed at different ratios, and the complexes were analyzed by nondenaturing gels (Fig. 5, B and C). Fusion protein and IFNγ dimer formed in all cases one major complex (c) for which amino acid analysis revealed a ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 5B, lanes 2-8 and Fig. 5C, lanes 2-8). In excess of IFNγ, additional bands migrating between the fusion protein f and the complex c were visible, suggesting the formation of complexes in which two IFNγ dimers were bound by one bivalent IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 4-5 and 8, and Fig. 5C, lane 4; these bands are broad and not clearly seen). Similar complexes were formed by one IFNγ dimer bound by one sIFNγR molecule when IFNγ was added in excess to the sIFNγR, although when the sIFNγR was available in adequate amounts, two soluble receptor molecules always bound one IFNγ dimer(41Fountoulakis M. Zulauf M. Lustig A. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When IFNγR-IgG3 was added in excess, again one complex c was formed. The excess of IFNγR-IgG3 remained uncomplexed (Fig. 5C, lanes 6-8). Thus, no complexes larger than complex c were detected. Formation of such complexes would suggest an agglutination-like situation in which the fusion protein and IFNγ could form precipitate. In immunodiffusion assays on agarose, IFNγR-IgG3 did not precipitate IFNγ, behaving like a nonprecipitating monoclonal antibody. IFNγ was not precipitated by the anti-IFNγ monoclonal antibody γ69 either (data not shown). In previous studies, using sIFNγRs produced in eukaryotic expression systems, we found that one IFNγ dimer is bound by two receptor molecules(35Fountoulakis M. Takacs-di Lorenzo E. Juranville J.-F. Manneberg M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Fountoulakis M. Zulauf M. Lustig A. Garotta G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The one human IFNγ dimer-two receptor relation was confirmed later by other groups(47Greenlund A.C. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Pennica D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18103-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Applying chemical cross-linking and using high concentrations of two cross-linkers simultaneously, they showed the generation of a 240-kDa product, likely consisting of one IFNγ dimer bound by two native receptor molecules, thus confirming dimerization of the native receptor in the presence of ligand. Based on predicted homology between IFNγR and members of the hematopoietic receptor family (48Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar) and in analogy to the crystal structure of the human growth hormone receptor(49de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar), we proposed a model for the IFNγ ligand-receptor interaction(45Stüber D. Friedlein A. Fountoulakis M. Lahm H.-W. Garotta G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2423-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). According to that model, the extracellular part of the IFNγ receptor consists of two Ig-like domains linked in a V-shaped structure. The two domains are connected with one essential disulfide (Cys105-Cys150). The region at the convergence of the two Ig-like domains most likely includes the ligand binding domain of the receptor. That this region is essential for ligand binding was confirmed by studies with mutant IFNγ receptors carrying domains of both the human and mouse species(50Axelrod A. Gibbs V.C. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, applying four approaches, we found that two IFNγR-IgG3 molecules, carrying two ligand binding sites each, bind two IFNγ dimers. Such a complex could be formed if each IFNγ dimer interacts with one of the IFNγ binding regions of one fusion protein and one of the binding regions of a second fusion protein (Fig. 6A). The model of the IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein-IFNγ dimer binding (Fig. 6A) shows that the stoichiometry of interaction is responsible for the higher ligand binding affinity of the fusion protein and for the better performance in competition of binding and inhibition of antiviral activity, in comparison with soluble receptors, in which case two receptor molecules bind only one ligand dimer (Fig. 6B). We produced in CHO cells a human IFNγR-IgG3 fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of the IFNγ receptor and parts of the human IgG γ3 heavy chain and worked out a purification method that delivered homogeneous IFNγR-IgG3. We investigated the stoichiometry of its interaction with the ligand, finding that two molecules of IFNγR-IgG3 bind two IFNγ dimers and explaining its superior performance in comparison with soluble receptors. The fusion protein has a slower IFNγ-exchange rate and is expected to have a longer half-life in vivo in comparison with the sIFNγRs; therefore, it may prove useful as an antagonist of endogenous IFNγ in the treatment of immunological and inflammatory diseases."

Our aims were to test this hypothesis and to assess the effect of the cleavage on the enzyme's two ATP sites. Na+-dependent phosphorylation of the partially cleaved enzyme by ATP showed that K0.5 values of ATP for phosphorylations of intact α and 48-kDa peptide were the same (0.4 μM). Unchanged interactions among the residues across the cleavage site were also indicated by data showing that reaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate with the 64-kDa peptide blocked phosphorylation of the 48-kDa peptide by ATP.ATP is known to block the reaction of fluorescein isothiocyanate with the enzyme. Experiments on the partially cleaved enzyme showed that K0.5 of ATP for protection of α was 30-60 μM, and the value for the protection of interacting 48-kDa and 64-kDa peptides was 1-3 mM. Evidently, while the cleavage does not affect the high affinity catalytic site, it disrupts the allosteric low affinity ATP site.Experiments on reconstituted preparations showed that the cleavage abolished ATP-dependent Na+/K+ exchange, Pi+ ATP-dependent Rb+/Rb+ exchange, ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange, and ADP + ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange activities. Selective disruption of the low affinity ATP site accounts for the inhibitions of all functions involving K+(Rb+), based on the established role of this site in the control of K+ access channels. Cleavage-induced inhibitions of other activities, however, suggest additional roles of the low affinity ATP site in the reaction cycle.

Cleavage-induced inhibitions of other activities, however, suggest additional roles of the low affinity ATP site in the reaction cycle. Controlled proteolysis of the α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase has provided invaluable information about the structural organization of the enzyme within the plasma membrane(1Jorgensen P.L. Farley R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on the functional changes induced by controlled proteolysis have also been of help in generating hypotheses on the enzyme's structure-function relationships(3Jorgensen P.L. Skriver E. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Jorgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys.

Of particular interest is the specific cleavage between Arg438 and Ala439 when the purified kidney enzyme is exposed to trypsin in the presence of K+. Because this cleavage site is between several residues (in the region of amino acids 470-720) that are involved in ATP binding and Asp369 which is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in the course of ATP hydrolysis(2Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tran C.M. Huston E.E. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6558-6565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to think that the cleavage may affect the functional coupling between the ATP binding site and the phosphorylation site. In fact, based on a number of studies(3Jorgensen P.L. Skriver E. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Jorgensen P.L.

Acta. 1977; 466: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that this cleavage interferes with the orientation of the two sites and reduces affinity for nucleotide binding at the catalytic site, while it allows the operation of several transport functions of the enzyme that require ATP binding and phosphorylation (3Jorgensen P.L. Skriver E. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Jorgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We were prompted to re-examine the functional consequences of this cleavage because previous work had not addressed the relation of the cleavage to the multiple nucleotide binding sites of the enzyme. That the native enzyme exhibits two nucleotide binding sites with widely different affinities has been known for a long time(9Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Askari A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 359-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Askari A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268A: 149-165PubMed Google Scholar). Uncertainties remain, however, on whether the two different affinities are those of the different conformational states that appear in sequence during the reaction cycle or are due to the simultaneous existence of two distinct binding sites on the functional unit of the enzyme(11Askari A. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268A: 149-165PubMed Google Scholar). The suggested effect of the trypsin cleavage on ATP affinity seemed to provide an opportunity for clarifying the relationships between the two nucleotide sites and the phosphorylation site. Purified membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase of canine kidney medulla, with specific activity in the range of 800-1600 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg of protein/h, was prepared as described before(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme (0.5 mg/ml) was exposed to trypsin at 37°C in a solution containing 10 mM KCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.3-0.5 μg of trypsin. Unless indicated otherwise, reaction time was chosen to achieve about 50% inactivation of the enzyme. The reaction was stopped by the addition of trypsin inhibitor (0.7 mg/μg of trypsin). The enzyme was collected by centrifugation in cold, washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and suspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 30 mM histidine (pH 6.8) prior to use. Reaction with FITC 1The abbreviations used are: FITCfluorescein isothiocyanateCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidAMPPCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate. was carried out by incubating the native or the partially cleaved enzyme (1 mg/ml) at 20°C for 30 min in a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.2), 1 mM EDTA, and the indicated concentrations of FITC. The reaction was terminated by 50-fold dilution with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and centrifugation at 100,000 × g. After an additional wash in the same buffer, the enzyme was suspended in 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 30 mM histidine (pH 6.8) and either used or stored frozen for subsequent use. Under these incubation conditions, 45 μM FITC caused more than 95% inhibition of Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity. For the detection of FITC-labeled peptides, the enzyme samples were subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis under alkaline conditions(13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the unstained gels were illuminated with UV light and photographed. fluorescein isothiocyanate 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate. ATPase assays were done at 37°C through the determination of the initial rate of release of 3232Pi from [γ-3232P]ATP(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixture for Na++ K+-dependent ATPase contained 2 mM ATP, 3 mM Mg2+, 100 mM Na+, 20 mM K+, 1 mM EGTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). For Na+-dependent ATPase, K+ was omitted, and 0.1 mM ATP was used. Na+-dependent ADP/ATP exchange was assayed at 37°C by measuring the rate of incorporation of [14C]ADP into ATP as described before(14Henderson G.R. Askari A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzyme phosphorylation by [γ-3232P]ATP was done at 0°C as described before (12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by incubating the enzyme in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+, 100 mM Na+, and the indicated ATP concentration for 90 s. This was sufficient to achieve the maximal level of phosphoenzyme. Phosphorylation by 3232Pi was done at 37°C for 10 min in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and the indicated Pi concentration, as described(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acid-denatured phosphorylated enzymes were either filtered and counted (12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis at pH 2.4(5Huang W.-H. Ganjeizadeh M. Wang Y. Chiu I.-N. Askari A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The gels were stained and autoradiographed by conventional procedures. The bands were quantified by a soft laser scanning densitometer. Multiple exposures of the radioactive bands were analyzed to ensure that the signals were within the linear range of the film. ADP binding to the enzyme was measured at 0°C by the centrifugation method(15Norby J.G. Jensen J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), in a medium containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and the indicated concentrations of [14C]ADP. The enzyme solubilized with C12E8 was prepared according to Esmann (16Esmann M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated as the native enzyme but in reaction mixtures containing 0.15% C12E8. For the assay of transport activities, the enzyme was solubilized with CHAPS and reconstituted by the following modifications of previous procedures(17Yoda A. Clark A.W. Yoda S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 778: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme was washed in buffer A containing 160 mM KCl and 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), and suspended (1 mg/ml) in the same buffer containing 1% CHAPS and 20% glycerol. After constant stirring on ice for 40 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble supernatant was mixed with soybean phospholipids (20 mg/ml) and vortexed to obtain a uniform suspension. The suspension (0.5 ml) was placed on a 5-ml Sephadex G-25-300 column which had been equilibrated with buffer A, allowed to remain at 4°C for 60 min, and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min. The collected proteoliposomes from several columns were pooled and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 60 min. The sedimented proteoliposomes were mixed with buffer A to obtain a suspension of 1-2 μg of protein/μl. To assay ATP-dependent Na+/K+ exchange, 20 μl of this suspension was added to 180 μl of a reaction mixture containing 150 mM choline chloride, 5 mM22NaCl, 0.2 mM EGTA, 10 μM valinomycin, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2). ATP was omitted from the control. After 20 s of incubation at 23°C, the reaction was stopped by adding 3 ml of ice-cold buffer A, and the mixture was passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter. The filter was washed twice with 3 ml of cold buffer A and counted. ATP-dependent Na+ uptake was calculated assuming linearity within the first 20 s. It was established that, under the conditions used here, the time course of ATP-dependent Na+ uptake by these proteoliposomes was similar to that described before(31Cornelius F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 19-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes to be used for Na+/Na+ exchange were prepared as above, except that buffer A was replaced with one containing 200 mM NaCl and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). For the assay of ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange, the reaction mixture contained 5 mM22NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, and 205 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). For the assay of ATP + ADP-dependent exchange, the reaction mixture was the same, except that it contained 1 mM ATP + 1 mM ADP. Appropriate controls without ATP and ADP were included. Incubation time was 2 min. For the assay of Rb+/Rb+ exchange, proteoliposomes were prepared similarly, except that buffer A was replaced with one containing 25 mM RbCl2 and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). The complete reaction mixture contained 10 mM86RbCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Pi, 1 mM ATP, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Reaction time was 1 min. Controls without Pi and ATP were included, and it was established that both Pi and ATP were required for the stimulation of uptake. Protein in proteoliposomes was measured according to Kaplan and Pedersen(18Kaplan R.S. Pedersen R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Trypsin (type III-S, bovine pancreas), trypsin inhibitor (soybean), ATP, FITC, and crude soybean phospholipid IV were obtained from Sigma. All radioisotopes were purchased from DuPont NEN. 3232Pi was purified before use(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the enzyme with trypsin and K+ resulted in the cleavage of the α-subunit into two fragments with molecular masses of about 64 kDa and 48 kDa (Fig. 1a). When the incubation time with trypsin was varied in a number of experiments, and the disappearance of intact α was correlated with Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity (Fig. 2), it became apparent that the cleavage caused complete inhibition of this activity.Figure 2:Relation between activity and remaining α after exposure to trypsin and K+. Enzyme samples were exposed to trypsin for different periods. Remaining α was estimated by densitometry of stained gels, and Na++ K+-dependent ATPase was assayed under standard conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the 7.5% acid gels of Fig. 1a, the 64-kDa peptide was not clearly separated from the intact β-subunit. Such separation was achieved on 5% gels, allowing the determination of the N-terminal sequence of the 64-kDa peptide. This turned out to be XVAGDA, consistent with the cleavage occurring between Arg438 and Ala439 of the canine kidney α sequence(19Xie Z.J. Li H. Liu Q. Wang Y. Askari A. Mercer R.W. Bamberg E. Schoner W. The Sodium Pump. Darmstadt-Steinkopff, Springer, New York1994: 49-52Crossref Google Scholar). This location is in agreement with that of the cleavage point in the pig kidney enzyme(20Jorgensen P.L. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In experiments of Fig. 1b, the partially cleaved preparation was exposed to [γ-3232P]ATP in the presence of Mg2++ Na+ or Mg2++ K+, subjected to electrophoresis on acid gels, and autoradiographed. The results confirmed previous findings(3Jorgensen P.L. Skriver E. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), showing that the 48-kDa peptide, like the intact α, is phosphorylated by ATP in a Na+-dependent manner. Na+-dependent phosphorylation of the native enzyme by ATP involves nucleotide binding to the high affinity catalytic site. Based on indirect evidence, the affinity of this site was postulated to be reduced after the trypsin cleavage(3Jorgensen P.L. Skriver E. Hebert H. Maunsbach A.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 402: 207-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis directly, the partially cleaved enzyme was phosphorylated in the presence of different concentrations of [γ-3232P]ATP, and the extent of 3232P-labeling of the intact α and the 48-kDa peptide was determined on acid gels. The inset to Fig. 3 shows the gels obtained in one such experiment. The combined data of similar experiments with seven different partially cleaved preparations (Fig. 3) showed that K0.5 value of ATP for phosphorylation of the 48-kDa peptide was not different from that of the intact α, indicating that the high affinity ATP binding site is not disturbed by the cleavage. 2It may be argued that a cleavage-induced decrease in the affinity of ATP may not be reflected by a change in the K0.5 of ATP for phosphoenzyme formation because of a concomitant cleavage-induced decrease in the rate of dephosphorylation. This is unlikely, however, because when the partially cleaved enzyme was phosphorylated by labeled ATP, and the disappearances of the phosphorylated α and 48-kDa peptides were examined over a 30-s period after addition of EDTA or unlabeled ATP, there was no significant difference between the two dephosphorylation rates. These results, in conjunction with those of Fig. 2, implied that the cleaved α-subunits that bind ATP with high affinity and are phosphorylated do not participate in Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity. To test this directly, in a number of partially cleaved preparations, Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity and the maximal level of phosphoenzyme formation from ATP were determined and compared with the corresponding control values. In all partially cleaved preparations, the remaining phosphoenzyme exceeded the remaining ATPase activity (Fig. 4). That the total phosphoenzyme was reduced at all in the cleaved preparations is most likely due to the secondary cleavage of the 48-kDa peptide(8Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In preparations that had lost ATPase activity by more than 70%, we consistently noted additional peptide bands with mobilities higher than those of the 48-kDa peptide (not shown). To compare the responses of the intact and the cleaved α to Na+ and K+, experiments of Fig. 5 were done. The partially cleaved enzyme was phosphorylated with saturating ATP in the presence of different Na+ concentrations, and the phosphorylated bands were quantitated on acid gels. The Na+ activation curves for the intact α and the 48-kDa peptide were superimposable (Fig. 5a). In similar experiments, the inhibitory effects of varying K+ concentrations on Na+-dependent phosphorylations of the intact α and the 48-kDa peptide were also found to be nearly identical (Fig. 5b). ADP also binds to the high affinity ATP site(15Norby J.G. Jensen J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the bindings of [14C]ADP to the control enzyme and a partially cleaved preparation were measured at different ADP concentrations (0.2-20 μM) as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” the dissociation constants evident from the resulting plots were 2.1 μM and 2.3 μM, respectively. This apparent lack of effect of the cleavage on high affinity ADP binding is in agreement with previous data (8Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 466: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showing equal affinities of the control and the partially cleaved enzymes for ATP binding to the high affinity site. One possible explanation for these findings is that the cleavage abolishes high affinity nucleotide binding (or greatly reduces its affinity) so that the detected binding to the partially cleaved enzyme is solely due to the remaining uncleaved enzyme. The alternative is that the control and the cleaved enzymes have the same affinity at the high affinity site. To distinguish between the alternatives, in two partially cleaved enzymes and controls, Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activities and [14C]ADP binding capacities at 20 μM ADP were compared. In both cleaved preparations, the remaining ADP binding capacities exceeded the remaining ATPase activities (Fig. 4). These data support the conclusions of the phosphorylation experiments of Figure 3:, Figure 4:, indicating that the high affinity nucleotide binding site is not affected by the cleavage. FITC inhibits Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity of the enzyme irreversibly by reacting with one or more lysine residues at or near the nucleotide binding sites of the α-subunit(2Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 22Farley R.A.

Commun. 1984; 125: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). There is evidence to indicate that FITC interacts with both high and low affinity nucleotide sites. In the FITC-labeled enzyme, the high affinity ATP site is not detected(21Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the affinity of the low affinity site is reduced(26Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, reaction of FITC with the enzyme is prevented by ATP at the low affinity site(27Sen P.C. Kapakos J.G. Steinberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Garner M.H. Spector A. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of the FITC-labeled enzyme has been studied(21Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 29Carilli C.T. Farley R.A. Perlman D.M. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5601-5606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to learn more about the effects of the trypsin cleavage on the phosphorylation and the nucleotide binding sites, in the following experiments we cleaved the enzyme first and then studied the interactions of the partially cleaved enzyme with FITC and ATP. A partially cleaved enzyme preparation was reacted with FITC to obtain inhibition of the remaining Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity. When this preparation was subjected to gel electrophoresis, the fluorescence of the incorporated fluorescein was detected in the intact α and the 64-kDa C-terminal peptide, but not in the 48-kDa peptide (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the locations of the lysine residues of the intact α that have been shown to react with FITC(2Pedemonte C.H. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1-C23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction of FITC with the native enzyme blocks high affinity ATP binding and the Na+-dependent phosphorylation by ATP(21Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 22Farley R.A. Tran C.M. Carilli C.T. Hawke D. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9532-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments of Fig. 7, samples of the partially cleaved enzyme were exposed to different FITC concentrations for a fixed time period and washed. After phosphorylation with 1 μM [γ-3232P]ATP, the samples were resolved on acid gels and autoradiographed. The results (Fig. 7) clearly showed that reaction with FITC blocks phosphorylations of both the intact α and the 48-kDa peptide. Quantitation of the autoradiograms of Fig. 7 indicated equal sensitivities of the phosphorylations of intact α and 48-kDa peptide to varying FITC concentrations. The K0.5 value of FITC estimated from Fig. 7 is about the same as the Kd value (5.7 μM) calculated previously from inactivation rate constants(22Farley R.A. Tran C.M. Carilli C.T. Hawke D. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9532-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The combined data of Figure 6:, Figure 7: indicate that the reaction of FITC with the 64-kDa peptide blocks high affinity ATP binding to the interacting 64-kDa and 48-kDa peptides and prevents the phosphorylation of the 48-kDa peptide. To see if detergent solubilization affects the interaction between 64-kDa and 48-kDa peptides, the following experiments were done. The partially cleaved enzyme was reacted with FITC to obtain complete inhibition of its remaining ATPase activity. This, and the partially cleaved preparation not reacted with FITC, were then solubilized with C12E8 as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” and exposed to [γ-3232P]ATP as in the experiments of Fig. 7. The results (not shown) were identical with those seen with the membrane-bound preparation. While the 48-kDa peptide of the control-solubilized preparation was phosphorylated, that of the solubilized FITC-labeled preparation was not phosphorylated. Evidently, interaction between the 48-kDa and 64-kDa peptides is not disturbed by solubilization. ATP prevents the reaction of FITC with the native enzyme(21Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1980; 12: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Abbot A.J. Almer E. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This protection, however, requires such high concentrations of ATP that it suggests the involvement of the low affinity ATP site(27Sen P.C. Kapakos J.G. Steinberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 211: 652-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Garner M.H. Spector A. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To compare the protective effects of ATP on FITC reactions with intact α and 64-kDa peptide, samples of the partially cleaved enzyme were reacted for a fixed period with a fixed concentration of FITC in the absence of ATP and in the presence of varying ATP concentrations (0.01-2.5 mM). After washing, fluorescence of the fluorescein incorporated into intact α-subunit and 64-kDa peptide were detected as in Fig. 6 and quantitated by densitometry. The results (Fig. 8) showed clearly that ATP was far more effective in preventing FITC reaction with intact α than with the 64-kDa peptide. Since FITC reacts with different classes of sites on the enzyme(24Abbot A.J. Almer E. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), it was necessary to assess the functional relevance of the sites whose reactions with FITC were prevented by ATP in the above experiments. Therefore, another set of experiments similar to those of Fig. 8 was conducted. After reaction of the partially cleaved enzymes with FITC in the presence of varying ATP concentrations, excess ATP and FITC were removed by washing, each sample was phosphorylated with 1 μM [γ-3232P]ATP, and the levels of 3232P-labeled α and 48-kDa peptides were determined on acid gels (Fig. 9). The results showed clearly that (a) when unlabeled ATP was present during the reaction of FITC with the enzyme, subsequent phosphorylation with labeled ATP was greater and (b) at each ATP concentration, protection of α was greater than that of the 48-kDa peptide. From the data of Fig. 8 and quantitation of the results of Fig. 9, the approximate K0.5 value of ATP for the protection of α was 30-60 μM, and the value for the protection of 64-kDa and 48-kDa peptides was 1-3 mM. Evidently, trypsin cleavage causes a significant decrease in the affinity of a low affinity ATP site of the enzyme. Asp369 of the native α-subunit is also phosphorylated by Pi in the presence of Mg2+(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition of this phosphorylation by nucleotides involves a low affinity nucleotide site(30Askari A. Huang W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4169-4176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to compare the interactions of Pi and nucleotides with intact and cleaved α-subunits. Experiments of Fig. 10a with a partially cleaved enzyme showed that at 2 mM Mg2+, the K0.5 values of Pi were nearly the same for phosphorylations of intact α and 48-kDa peptide and similar to the value for phosphorylation of the native enzyme at 2 mM Mg2+(12Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For technical reasons, it is difficult to use ATP to study the low affinity inhibitory effects of nucleotides on Pi phosphorylation(30Askari A. Huang W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4169-4176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments of Fig. 10b, the effects of AMPPCP on phosphorylations of the intact α and 48-kDa peptide by Pi were studied in a partially cleaved preparation. The results of Fig. 10 clearly suggest that the trypsin cleavage causes a significant decrease in the affinity of an AMPPCP binding site. Since previous data on the transport functions of the trypsin-cleaved enzyme were limited and inconclusive (Table III of (4Jorgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), for the further assessment of the functional consequences of the altered low affinity nucleotide binding site, reconstituted preparations of intact and partially cleaved enzyme were used to assay ATP-dependent Na+/K+ exchange, Pi+ ATP-dependent Rb+/Rb+ exchange, ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange, and ATP + ADP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange. All four activities were inhibited by the cleavage, and there were no significant differences among their inhibitions (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab While the ATP-dependent Na+/K+ exchange reflects the Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity, the ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange and ADP + ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange represent the Na+-dependent ATPase and Na+-dependent ADP/ATP exchange activities, respectively (31Cornelius F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 19-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As expected from the data of Table 1, experiments of Table 2 showed no significant differences among the cleavage-induced inhibitions of the two ATPase and the ADP-ATP exchange activities. Our finding on the inhibition of ADP-ATP exchange by the trypsin cleavage is in agreement with a previous report(32Winter C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).Table II Open table in a new tab Since the above experiments indicated the disruption of a low affinity nucleotide site, but not that of the catalytic site, by trypsin cleavage, Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activities of partially cleaved and control preparations were compared at six different ATP concentrations in the range of 0.05-5 mM. Percent inhibitions were the same at all concentrations (data not shown). Our data showing that ATP phosphorylates the 48-kDa fragment with the same high affinity that it phosphorylates the intact α-subunit (Fig. 3) and the supporting data on high affinity ADP binding (Fig. 4 and “Results”) clearly indicate that the ensemble of residues involved in high affinity ATP binding and enzyme phosphorylation is not disturbed by the trypsin cleavage, in spite of the fact that the components of the ensemble are located on both sides of the cleavage site. Continued interaction among the residues on the two sides of the cleavage site is also indicated by the data showing that reaction of FITC with the 64-kDa fragment prevents phosphorylation of the 48-kDa fragment by ATP (Figure 6:, Figure 7:). That this phenomenon persists after detergent solubilization (see “Results”) suggests the high stability of the continued interaction between the proteolytic fragments. In sharp contrast to the high affinity ATP binding site, the low affinity ATP binding site whose occupation protects against FITC inactivation is clearly disrupted by the trypsin cleavage (Fig. 8 and 9). Since FITC inactivation experiments are done at pH 9.2, and ATP phosphorylation experiments at pH 7.2, one may suspect that pH differences account for the above contrast. That this is not the case, however, is indicated by the fact that disruption of the low affinity nucleotide site by the cleavage is also noted in Pi phosphorylation experiments done at pH 7.2 (Fig. 10). The most obvious explanation for the selective disruption of the low affinity site by the trypsin cleavage is that the two nucleotide sites are distinct physical entities. The phenomenon may also be explained by assuming that the two sites are on two interconvertible conformational states and that the cleavage is disruptive to one conformation but not the other. The latter alternative, however, is not consistent with previous data showing the simultaneous bindings of nucleotides to the two sites(26Scheiner-Bobis G. Antonipillai J. Farley R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9592-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Kakar S.S. Huang W.-H. Askari A. Biochem. Int. 1985; 11: 611-616PubMed Google Scholar, 34Askari A. Kakar S.S. Huang W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 235-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if the two sites are indeed slightly different states of the same ensemble of residues(35Dzhandzhugazyan K.N. Lutsenko S.V. Modyanov N.N. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268A: 181-188PubMed Google Scholar), it is necessary to assume that the two states are not mutually exclusive; i.e. there must be a hybrid species containing the two conformational states. It is convenient to consider the functional consequences of the disruption of the low affinity site in the context of the widely used Albers-Post reaction cycle. In a simple version of this cycle for Na++ K+-dependent ATPase and Na+/K+ exchange (Fig. 11), the high affinity site is the catalytic site on E1 at which ATP binds and phosphorylates the enzyme, and the low affinity site is on E2 where ATP binds to widen the access channels for K+(36Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the release of occluded K+ from the stable E2(K+) and the conversion of E2 to E1. In this scheme, Na+-dependent ATP/ADP exchange and ATP + ADP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange are due to reactions 1 and 2; Pi+ ATP-dependent K+/K+ exchange (or Rb+/Rb+ exchange) is due to reactions 3 and 4; and Na+-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange are due to the entire cycle when Ko+ is replaced with Nao+(31Cornelius F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 19-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The observed inhibitions of Na++ K+-dependent ATPase activity ( Fig. 2and Table 2) and ATP-dependent Na+/K+exchange (Table 1) resulting from trypsin cleavage are not due to any cleavage-induced change in the affinity of ATP at the high affinity catalytic site (Fig. 3). The apparent affinity of Na+for phosphorylation of the cleaved enzyme, and its apparent K+affinity, are also not significantly different from the corresponding Na+and K+affinities of the intact enzyme (Fig. 5), and the normal Na+-induced and K+-induced fluorescence responses of the cleaved enzyme have also been reported(4Jorgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) . The inhibitions of the two physiologically prominent activities of the enzyme by the cleavage are consistent, however, with the selective disruption of the low affinity ATP site since this site is involved in the normal cycle of these activities (Fig. 11). That inhibition of Na++ K+-dependent ATPase of the cleaved enzyme is independent of ATP concentration (see “Results”), however, suggests that the damage done by the cleavage is not a simple matter of reduced ATP affinity at the low affinity site. It is likely that the coupling mechanism between the site and the K+access channels of E2(36Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also disturbed by the cleavage. The inability of the cleaved enzyme to carry out Pi+ ATP-dependent Rb+/Rb+ exchange (Table 1) is also expected since this mode of exchange requires ATP only at the low affinity site. The observed inhibitions of Na+-dependent ATPase, Na+-dependent ADP/ATP exchange, and the Na+/Na+ exchange activities by the trypsin cleavage (Table I, Table II), however, are more difficult to explain. Although the relation of a disrupted low affinity nucleotide site to these activities is not apparent from Fig. 11, there are previous studies that implicate the site in these partial reactions. The K0.5 values of ADP for the activations of Na+-dependent ADP/ATP exchange and ADP + ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange are significantly higher than the dissociation constant of ADP for the high affinity nucleotide site, suggesting the possibility of the participation of both high and low affinity nucleotide sites in these reactions(37Robinson J.D.

In the case of Na+-dependent ATPase activity and the corresponding ATP-dependent Na+/Na+ exchange, the hyperbolic ATP curves and the K0.5 values (39Cornelius F. Skou J.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18028-18036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest the existence of the low affinity ATP site during the reaction cycle of Na+-dependent ATPase. Our data suggest, therefore, that even if the low affinity site need not be fully occupied, its disruption by trypsin cleavage prevents the completion of the Na+-dependent ATPase cycle. The recent observations on the involvement of the low affinity ATP site in Na+-dependent phosphorylation (44Peluffo R.D. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6596-6601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Peluffo R.D. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) may prove to be relevant to the clarification of the role of this site in the various Na+-dependent activities of the enzyme. It is appropriate to point out that in alternatives to the Albers-Post cycle, i.e. the variations of the bicyclic scheme(46Plesner L. Plesner I.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 818: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 47Plesner I.W. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 69-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is also difficult to reconcile the selective disruption of the low affinity site with inhibitions of Na+/Na+ exchange activities and Na+-dependent ATPase. The long established role of the low affinity ATP site in K+ deocclusion (Fig. 11) has attracted such attention that we may have overlooked additional roles of this site in the function of the enzyme. The most general conclusion to be drawn from our data is that the coupling of the low affinity site to the high affinity and phosphorylation sites seems to be essential for most catalytic functions of the enzyme. Whether the pathways of this and related coupling mechanisms are within a single α-chain, or across the boundaries of αn, or both(36Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2001708715,"The effect of high density lipoprotein composition on the rates of unesterified cholesterol exchange between low density lipoproteins (LDL) and well-defined homogeneous discoidal lipoproteins (LpA-I) reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has been investigated. LpA-I containing cholesterol and 2, 3, and 4 apoA-I molecules per particle differed in their ability to accept or donate cholesterol. A significant cholesterol exchange occurs between LDL and Lp2A-I (7.8 and 9.6 nm), while there is little or no cholesterol exchange detectable between LDL and Lp3A-I (10.8 and 13.4 nm) and Lp4A-I (17.0 nm) complexes. The cholesterol transfer from LDL to the cholesterol-free Lp2A-I (9.6 nm), Lp3A-I (13.4 nm), and Lp4A-I (17.0 nm) particles also shows significant cholesterol transfer to Lp2A-I, while there is no detectable transfer to Lp3- and 4A-I particles. The rates of cholesterol transfer to cholesterol-free and cholesterol-containing Lp2A-I appear to differ significantly. Cholesterol transfer from LDL to cholesterol-free Lp2A-I is zero order with respect to acceptor concentrations when the Lp2A-I/LDL ratio is above 10. Transfer rates from LDL to cholesterol-free Lp2A-I are faster for the smaller Lp2A-I (8.5 nm) than to the larger Lp2A-I (9.7 nm) and exhibit half-times (t1/2) at 25 degrees C of 4.0 and 5.3 h, respectively. In contrast, cholesterol transfer from LDL to cholesterol-containing Lp2A-I remains dependent upon acceptor concentrations to an acceptor/donor particle ratio of 80. In addition, transfer from LDL to cholesterol-containing Lp2A-I is faster to the 9.6 nm than to 7.8 nm particles, with t1/2 of 1.4 and 2.3 h, respectively. The rates of cholesterol transfer from Lp2A-I to LDL are higher than in the opposite direction, in particular for the small Lp2A-I (7.8 nm), which has a t1/2 of approximately 50 min. The results show that changes in the composition and structure of apoA-I-containing particles have a significant effect on inter-lipoprotein exchange of cholesterol. This suggests that the kinetics of cholesterol transfer to and from reconstituted discoidal LpA-I particles cannot be fully explained by passive aqueous diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W2125212637,"Formation and repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) was examined in three different genes in mouse L cells: 1) a stably integrated insert (called LTL), consisting of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (tk) fused to a hormone inducible promotor (LTR); 2) the constitutively expressed proto-oncogene c-abl; and 3) the inactive immunoglobulin J chain gene.

There is a nonuniform distribution of CPDs in LTL DNA irradiated in vitro, being 4-fold higher in the LTR than in the tk gene, indicating the LTR may be damaged preferentially in irradiated cells. Repair of CPDs occurs efficiently in both strands of LTL and is unaffected by hormone induction of tk gene transcription. Transcription of tk mRNA is very sensitive to UV damage and follows single hit kinetics with UV dose. Furthermore, tk mRNA expression rapidly recovers during repair incubation. Transcription-coupled repair occurs in these cells, however, since only the transcribed strand of c-abl is efficiently repaired of CPDs; the nontranscribed strand as well as both strands of the J chain gene are inefficiently repaired. Thus, repair in the LTL construct may reflect a lack of transcription-coupled repair in either the LTR promotor or the LTL insertion region of chromatin.

Thus, repair in the LTL construct may reflect a lack of transcription-coupled repair in either the LTR promotor or the LTL insertion region of chromatin. It has become increasingly clear that formation and repair of different DNA lesions is not equal across the genome (reviewed in Smerdon, 1991). For example, many transcribed genes are repaired more efficiently than the bulk of the DNA in most eukaryotic cells studied thus far, and this preference extends to the template strand of RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Friedberg et al., 1994). This “selective repair” of active genes is very pronounced in rodent cells and may explain earlier observations that these cells are partially deficient in repair of ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage to the genome overall, yet survive as well as human cells that are proficient in overall repair (reviewed in Smith, 1987). The biological importance of differential repair is implicated in the human genetic disorders Cockayne's syndrome and xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group C). Cockayne's syndrome cells have lost the ability to preferentially repair transcriptionally active DNA (Venema et al., 1990a; van Hoffen, et al., 1993), while xeroderma pigmentosum (complementation group C) cells have a reduced ability in repairing the bulk of the genome (Venema et al., 1990b; Evans et al., 1993). What is not clear is the mechanism(s) by which this selective repair takes place and how repair processes are linked to transcription and chromatin structure. However, studies on Escherichia coli, demonstrating a repair bias in the transcribed strand and the requirement for the mfd gene product, predict that a transcription-repair coupling factor(s) exists in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (e.g. see Drapkin et al., 1994). Transcription-repair coupling may not exist in all cells, however. de Cock and co-workers (de Cock et al., 1991, 1992a) did not observe transcription-coupled repair in a cell line derived from Drosophila melanogaster embryonic cells. These authors found no evidence for preferential repair or strand-specific repair of UV-induced cis-syn cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) 1The abbreviations used are: CPDcis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimerMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusLTRlong terminal repeatHSVherpes simplex virustk,thymidine kinaseLTLLTR-tk-LTR fusion constructGREglucocorticoid response elementT4 endo VT4 UV endonuclease VTStranscribed strandCScoding strand. in the transcriptionally active Gart and Notch genes. They also found efficient repair of CPDs in the inactive white gene and in the genome overall (80-90% CPDs removed in 24 h). Furthermore, no preferential or strand-specific repair of CPDs was observed in the β3-tubulin gene upon induction of transcription (de Cock et al., 1992b). As discussed by these authors, the rate of overall genome repair in D. melanogaster embryonic cells is much higher than in rodent cells, and the lack of transcription-repair coupling may be specific for certain cell types. A similar observation was reported for the cysteine proteinase gene of Dictostelium discoideum (Mauldin et al., 1994). Once again, genomic repair in these cells is very efficient and much higher than in rodent cells (Mauldin et al., 1994). In the present study, we have examined repair of three different types of pol II genes (an inducible foreign gene, a constitutively expressed native gene, and an inactive native gene), to address the question of whether transcription-coupled repair can vary in the same cells. cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase LTR-tk-LTR fusion construct glucocorticoid response element T4 UV endonuclease V transcribed strand coding strand. We have used a mouse cell line (L1.4-3) containing a stably integrated construct (LTL) consisting of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (tk) inserted between two long terminal repeats (LTR) from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The constitutively silent (or near silent) tk gene lacks its own promoter and is transcribed from the glucocorticoid hormone-inducible promoter in the upstream LTR (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). Induction of the tk gene is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure, as shown by appearance of broad DNase I sensitivity and specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). The broad DNase I sensitivity is enhanced, however, relative to the inactive J chain gene even in the absence of induction (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). The MMTV-LTRs are known to contain six precisely positioned nucleosomes, where one of these nucleosomes is positioned over the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) required for hormonal induction (Richard-Foy and Hager, 1987; Piña et al., 1990b). This nucleosome is important in positioning the sequence for transcriptional induction and is disrupted upon binding of the hormone-receptor complex (Bresnick et al., 1990; Piña et al., 1990b). These features of the LTL construct provide an ideal system to correlate DNA damage and repair with both changes in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. Mouse cell line L1.4-3, containing the LTL construct stably integrated into the genomic DNA (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984), was provided by Drs. Kenneth Zaret and Keith Yamamoto (University of California at San Francisco). Cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), in the absence of phenol red (Picard and Yamamoto, 1987). Cells were usually split 1:4 in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, grown for 3-4 days, and the medium replaced with fresh medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown an additional 2-3 days before being used for an experiment. Forty-five min before UV irradiation, dexamethasone (Sigma, 0.1 mM stock solution in ethanol) was added to a final concentration of 0.1 μM to some plates to induce tk gene expression. For most repair experiments, cells were either prelabeled with 5 nCi/ml [3H]dThd during rapid growth and density-labeled with 10 μM BrdUrd, 1 μM FdUrd during repair incubation (Smith et al., 1981), or treated with 2 mM hydroxyurea as described previously (Smerdon et al., 1979). Cells in monolayer cultures in Petri dishes were placed on ice and washed once with ice-cold TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl). The cells were irradiated in a (desk-top) hood containing a single low pressure mercury lamp (Sylvania, model G 30T8) providing predominantly 254 nm light. The UV flux was measured using either a Black Ray UV meter (Ultra-Violet Products, San Gabriel, CA) or Spectroline DM-254N UV meter (Spectronics Corporation, Westbury, NY). Cells were either harvested immediately after irradiation or incubated for varying repair times and DNA isolated as described in Murad(1991). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g), resuspended in nuclei isolation buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100), and vortexed for 1-2 min. Nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 1500 × g and resuspended in STE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaCl) by gentle vortexing. Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and nuclei were digested with 150 μg/ml proteinase K at 42°C for 8-12 h. The DNA was precipitated twice in ethanol and 2.5 M ammonium acetate, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA). Aliquots containing 40-60 μg of DNA in 150-200 μl of TE buffer were digested to completion with restriction endonucleases, as determined by electrophoresis on 0.5% agarose mini-gels. DNA was again precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer to a final concentration of 1-1.5 μg/μl. For density-labeled samples, unreplicated DNA was isolated by neutral CsCl gradient centrifugation (Smith et al., 1981; Ausubel et al., 1987). T4 endo V was either purified from E. coli strain AB2480 (see Murad, 1991), containing plasmid pTACdenV provided by Drs. Kristoffer Valerie and Jon de Riel (Temple University, PA), or obtained in purified form from Dr. R. Stephen Lloyd (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). Between 10 and 20 μg of restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA was aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes with linearized (unirradiated) plasmid DNA, containing DNA sequences complementary to the probe, as a standard to correct for loading differences between lanes. DNA in T4 endo V digestion buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was digested with 1 μl of a 1:10 dilution of T4 endo V preparation for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of concentrated alkaline gel loading buffer (Maniatis et al., 1982). Samples were loaded on 0.6-0.9% alkaline agarose gels (Maniatis et al., 1982) and electrophoresed at room temperature, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.), and hybridized with strand-specific probes (see below) as described in Murad(1991). Membranes were exposed to (preflashed) x-ray film with intensifying screens and stripped of RNA probes for additional hybridizations (Murad, 1991). Plasmids containing 1) the entire LTL construct (pLTL1), 2) an incomplete cDNA of the immunoglobulin J chain gene of mouse (pJc21), or 3) a 3.9-kb cDNA clone of the mouse c-abl type IV transcript (pBS-Ty4) were used for generating single strand probes. A 1.5-kb BamHI-NcoI tk gene fragment (see Fig. 1) and 1.0-kb ClaI-PvuII LTR fragment of pLTL1, and a 1.2-kb EcoRI fragment of pJc21, were subcloned into plasmid pBS (Stratagene Cloning Systems, CA) containing T3 and T7 RNA promoters for generation of single strand RNA probes. Strand-specific RNA probes were generated from these plasmids, and plasmid pBS-Ty4, according to the manufacturer's specifications. Strand-specific DNA probes were generated using primer-extension from vector sequences (Ruven et al., 1994). After UV irradiation, the medium (containing 0.1 μM dexamethasone) was added, and cells were incubated for 60-90 min to induce tk gene expression. (For repair experiments, cells were incubated for longer periods (up to 24 h).) Total cellular RNA was isolated from L1.4-3 cells, electrophoresed on formaldehyde agarose gels (1.2%), transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with single strand (antisense) probes (Murad, 1991). Membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray films as described above. Film linearity and preflash conditions were determined using published procedures (see Murad, 1991). Quantitation of autoradiograms was performed by scanning with a laser densitometer (LKB model 2222) or by video densitometry using the Visage 60 computer system (Bio Image, MA) and the whole band analysis software for this system. In most cases, band intensities were normalized to the loading standard in each lane, and then to the band intensities of the -T4 endo V samples, to give the fraction of fragments free of CPDs (Po). The average number of CPD/fragment was determined from the Poisson equation [-ln(Po)] (Bohr and Okumoto, 1988). Fig. 1A shows a map of the LTL construct, as it was inserted into mouse L1.4-3 cells, where two transcripts are generated (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). The tk transcript starts in the 5′-LTR and continues to either the polyadenylation site in the tk gene (1.6 kb) or, less frequently, through the partial env gene to the polyadenylation site in the 3′-LTR (3.8 kb; Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). As shown in Fig. 1B, the 1.6-kb transcript is the major transcript induced (>50-fold) by treatment with 0.1 μM dexamethasone, and little transcription occurs in the absence of dexamethasone (also see Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984). Also shown in Fig. 1B is the 6.5-kb c-abl (type IV) transcript, which is constitutively expressed in these cells, and is unaffected by dexamethasone treatment. (For comparison, the blot shown in Fig. 1B was hybridized with the tk and c-abl probes simultaneously.) Initially, we measured the CPD yield in each strand of the 13.5-kb HindIII fragment (entire LTL insert) and the 3.7-kb StuI fragment (see Fig. 1A) of LTL using the method of Bohr et al. (1985). This assay measures the fraction of restriction fragments resistant to cutting by T4 endo V, which cleaves DNA strands specifically at CPDs. Cells were harvested immediately after irradiation, and genomic DNA was isolated and digested with either HindIII or StuI. An unirradiated 1.6-kb fragment containing the HSV tk gene was added to each sample, prior to T4 endo V digestion, to correct for loading differences between gel lanes. Samples were then treated (or mock treated) with T4 endo V, run on denaturing agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 3232P-labeled RNA probes containing the tk gene (see Fig. 1A). Fig. 2(top panel) shows sections of an autoradiogram obtained for each digest and probed with RNA complementary to the transcribed strand of the tk gene. Results from quantitation of Southern blots for cells irradiated at different UV doses are shown for both fragments in the bottom panel. The initial frequency of CPDs as a function of UV dose is plotted for both the transcribed (TS) and coding strands (CS) in the presence (dashed lines) or absence (solid lines) of dexamethasone. In the absence of dexamethasone, the average number of CPDs in each strand of the HindIII fragment is about 0.7 CPD/100 kb/J/m2, as determined from slopes of linear regression fits to the data. These values increased slightly (to about 1.0 CPD/100 kb/J/m2) for cells irradiated in the presence of dexamethasone. The smaller StuI fragment yielded a higher value (0.9 CPD/100 kb/J/m2) for each strand in the absence of dexamethasone and was essentially unchanged following treatment with dexamethasone (Fig. 2, C and D). The average number of CPD/100 kb/J/m2 formed in each fragment is shown in Table 1. Our values for CPD formation in the HindIII fragment of the LTL are within the range of values reported for other known sequences of DNA (e.g. see Venema et al., 1990a; Evans et al., 1993). The average number of CPDs in the genome of Chinese hamster ovary cells, as determined from alkaline sucrose gradient profiles, is about 0.7 CPD/100 kb/J/m2 (Bohr et al., 1985). Taken together, these data indicate that there is no unusual bias for CPD formation when the entire LTL domain is considered. However, we consistently observe frequencies of CPD formation (per unit of DNA) in the 3.7-kb StuI fragment that are about 25% higher than the 13.5-kb HindIII fragment (calculated from data such as that shown in Fig. 2, C and D). Since the HSV-tk gene is GC-rich (36% AT) and the LTR (56% AT) has many long T-tracts, we examined if the HSV-tk gene is less efficient in forming CPDs in plasmid DNA irradiated in vitro. Plasmid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes that liberated fragments from just the tk gene (1.5 kb) and LTR (1.0 kb) regions, and the samples were irradiated at high UV doses (to accurately measure the CPD yield in such short fragments; Bohr and Okumoto, 1988). The LTR fragment forms CPDs about 4-fold more efficiently than the tk gene sequence (Fig. 3). Thus, if most CPDs formed in the StuI fragment in vivo are localized outside the 1.5-kb tk sequence, the average number of CPDs formed in this fragment (per 100 kb/J/m2) may be much higher than in the longer HindIII fragment.Table I Open table in a new tab This agrees with a computer analysis of the LTL sequence (Murad, 1991), which examines the distribution of potential thymidine dimer (TD) sites, the major type of CPD in random sequence DNA (Patrick and Rahn, 1976). The MMTV-LTR sequence has an unusually high number of potential TD forming sites (e.g. 183 TT sites/kb in the LTR sequence and 25 of these are in runs of four or more), whereas the HSV-tk sequence has a much lower number (92 TT sites/kb and only eight in runs of four or more). This non-uniform distribution of potential TD sites within the LTL sequence becomes even more striking when the effect of adjacent flanking bases is taken into account (Murad, 1991). A similar search for TC pairs, the most prevalent sites for UV-induced) pyrimidine-pyrimidone formation (Franklin and Haseltine, 1986; Mitchell et al., 1990), failed to show any unusual bias in these sequences (110 TC sites/kb in the LTR and 92 TC sites/kb in the tk gene). These results again predict preferential damage by UV radiation in the LTR region in intact mouse L1.4-3 cells. Radiolabeling studies in mouse L cells have shown that total synthesis of RNA is reduced following UV irradiation (Sauerbier, 1976). More recently, it has been shown that a single CPD in a transcribed sequence will inhibit transcription through that sequence (Selby and Sancar, 1990; see also Protic-Sabljic and Kraemer, 1985). Therefore, for short-lived mRNA (i.e.t½≪ repair incubation times) Northern analysis yields an indirect assay of the level of transcription blocking UV damage to the DNA of an active gene. Treatment of mouse L1.4-3 cells with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D yields a half-life of 55 min for the 1.6-kb tk mRNA transcript (Murad, 1991). This indicates that the tk message is in the “short-lived class” of mRNAs in mammalian cells (Raghow, 1987) and can be used to monitor repair of the tk gene. If the inhibition of tk mRNA synthesis results from formation of UV photoproducts within sequences required for tk gene expression, then a plot of tk mRNA level versus UV dose should follow single-hit kinetics (Freifelder, 1982). Therefore, tk mRNA levels in mouse L1.4-3 cells, at 1.5 h after UV irradiation and treatment with dexamethasone, were determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, both induction and synthesis of new tk mRNA are required after UV damage to LTL. The tk mRNA levels decline exponentially with UV dose which is typical of one-hit, one-target events, indicating that synthesis of tk mRNA is directly inhibited by UV light. Furthermore, a UV dose of 20 J/m2 blocks >85% of the tk gene expression (Fig. 4). This result is not predicted for a random distribution of CPDs in LTL, where only 25% of the tk mRNA should be inhibited from direct blockage of RNA polymerase elongation (Fig. 4, dashed line), using the CPD/100 kb/J/m2 value for the StuI fragment (Table 1). This result suggests that hotspots for CPD formation may exist within sequences essential for tk transcription, and/or other UV photoproducts (e.g.) pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimers) play a major role in affecting tk gene transcription in the LTL. We initially measured removal of CPDs from both strands of the 13.5-kb HindIII fragment using the Southern blot method and a nick-translated probe to the LTL insert. As shown in Fig. 5A, after 12 J/m2 UV a fraction of the HindIII fragment (30-40%) remains uncut after T4 endo V treatment, and this fraction is markedly increased following 24 h of repair incubation. Surprisingly, this was observed in both dexamethasone-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 5A). Since some experimental variation was observed in the efficiency of BrdUrd-density labeling in these cells (possibly reflecting differential expression of the tk gene), we wondered if the appearance of efficient repair in the untreated cells was due, in part, to background replicative synthesis. Therefore, we used both the BrdUrd density-shift method, and 2 mM hydroxyurea to suppress replicative synthesis (Murad, 1991), to measure repair of CPDs in mouse L1.4-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, ~80% of the fragments are resistant to T4 endo V cutting after the 24-h incubation period in both density-labeled and hydroxyurea-suppressed cells. Thus, the increase in T4 endo V-resistant fragments in uninduced cells cannot be explained by background replicative synthesis. To determine if this efficient repair of LTL is reflected by a rapid recovery of tk mRNA expression, the level of full-length tk mRNA was examined after UV irradiation. (This “in vivo method” was used for measuring the recovery of tk mRNA transcription, instead of a nuclear run-off assay, since the latter only measures elongation from an already formed RNA polymerase complex and cannot measure effects of UV damage on initiation of the tk transcript.) As shown in Fig. 4, this expression is very sensitive to UV damage, being reduced by >85% after 20 J/m2 UV light. Northern blot experiments were performed to measure the return of tk mRNA after UV irradiation in cells treated with dexamethasone and hydroxyurea. Fig. 6A shows representative autoradiograms for different times after a UV dose of 20 J/m2. As can be seen, the level of full-length tk mRNA in irradiated cells lags behind the level observed in unirradiated cells following induction by dexamethasone. Quantitation of autoradiograms, such as those in Fig. 6A, indicates that over 65% of the tk mRNA production in unirradiated cells is recovered following 24 h of repair incubation (Fig. 6B). These data correlate with the efficient repair of CPDs observed in both strands to the LTL (see Fig. 5). Even though no differences are observed in repair of both strands (together) of LTL, following hormone induction, differences may be observed in repair of individual strands of this insert, as observed for all other transcribed genes examined in rodent cells (see Hanawalt and Mellon, 1993). Therefore, we investigated strand-specific repair of LTL, again using the method of Bohr et al.((5Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1988: 347-366Google Scholar), and complementary probes to individual strands of the tk gene. As shown in Fig. 7A, repair of CPDs in untreated cells was almost complete in each strand of LTL following 24 h of repair incubation after 12 J/m2 UV light. Quantitation of these autoradiograms, expressed as the percent of CPDs removed, is shown in Fig. 8(top panel) along with the time course for recovery of tk mRNA (dotted line). The data indicate that there is little difference in the extent of repair of CPDs after 24 h in either strand with or without induction of tk transcription, although a slight increase in repair rate may occur in the TS with dexamethasone treatment (compare open and closed circles in Fig. 8, top panel). Furthermore, the time course for repair is similar to that of the tk mRNA recovery, indicating that transcription-blocking CPDs are included in the sites efficiently repaired in the LTL insert.Figure 8:Repair of CPDs for individual strands of the integrated LTL construct, and active and inactive genomic genes in mouse L1.4-3 cells irradiated with 12 J/m2 UV light.

After electrophoresis and transfer (as in Fig. 7), membranes were hybridized with DNA probes to the template (○, •) or coding (Δ, ▲) strands of the tk gene (see Fig. 1). The dotted line is for the return of tk mRNA (taken from Fig. 6B). Bottom panel, repair of the constitutively expressed c-abl gene and the inactive immunoglobulin J chain gene. Data are for the transcribed strand of the BamHI fragment of c-abl (○, •) and both strands of the HindIII fragment of the J chain gene (Δ, ▲). The data shown are for one set of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is possible that mouse L1.4-3 cells repair all genomic sequences efficiently, similar to D. melanogaster embryonic cells (de Cock et al., 1991, 1992a, 1992b) and D. discoideum cells (Mauldin et al., 1994). Therefore, we examined whether preferential repair occurs in native genomic sequences in mouse L1.4-3 cells. Repair of CPDs was measured in the constitutively expressed c-abl proto-oncogene (Fig. 1B) and compared to repair in the inactive immunoglobulin J chain gene (Cann et al., 1982). These studies also served as controls for the effect of dexamethasone on the general repair response in these cells as the transcription of these genes is not affected by dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 1B; and Murad, 1991). The rate of repair of the c-abl gene in mouse 3T3 cells has been previously measured by Madhani et al.(1986). Although strand-specific repair was not measured in that study, these authors found that about 60% of the CPDs are removed from actively growing cells, and 85% of CPDs are removed from confluent cells, within 24 h. Fig. 7B shows autoradiograms for the repair of each strand of these two genes, after 20 J/m2 UV light with and without dexamethasone treatment. Quantitation of autoradiograms such as these, indicates that the c-abl gene is repaired in a strand-specific manner in L1.4-3 cells, and repair of the transcribed strand is similar to that reported for actively growing 3T3 cells (Fig. 8, bottom panel). The nontranscribed strand showed little (or no) repair during the 24-h incubation (Fig. 7B), similar to both strands of the inactive J chain gene (Fig. 8B), as expected for nontranscribed DNA in rodent cells. Finally, dexamethasone treatment had little effect on the repair in each of these sequences (Fig. 8) indicating that, at 0.1 μM concentration, dexamethasone does not markedly effect the normal repair response in these cells. Our results on the distribution of UV-induced CPDs in the inserted LTL construct indicate that the majority of these lesions are localized in the LTR region of intact mouse cells. Combination of in vivo and in vitro dose response curves, as well as sequence analysis for potential thymidine dimer (TD) sites, indicates that CPD formation may occur at a higher frequency in the MMTV-LTR than reported previously for other defined sequences (e.g. see Evans et al., 1993; Venema et al., 1990a). The extent of damage to the tk gene seen by Northern blot analysis (>85% of transcription blocked after 20 J/m2 UV) in a transcript that is only 1.6 kb in size also suggests there are “hotspots” for UV damage in the LTL domain. In addition, the fact that this inhibition follows single-hit theory (Fig. 4) suggests that the inhibition of transcription is a direct result of UV damage to LTL DNA. Both the primary sequence of LTR (e.g. long pyrimidine tracts) and the conformation of DNA in chromatin may contribute to this inhibition in vivo. Formation of CPDs has been shown to be modulated by (a) flanking sequences (e.g. Gordon and Haseltine, 1982; Mitchell, et al. 1992), (b) DNA conformation (e.g. Becker and Wang, 1989; Tang et al., 1991), (c) nucleosome formation (Gale et al., 1987; Gale and Smerdon, 1988), and (d) binding of transcription factors (Pfeifer et al., 1992). The phased array of six nucleosomes in the MMTV-LTR may “fix” the path of the DNA helix around the histone octamer (Piña et al., 1990a), yielding favorable stacking of pyrimidine bases at specific sites for formation of CPDs or other UV photoproducts (Gale and Smerdon, 1988; Pfeifer et al., 1992). Although there is good evidence that CPDs in the path of RNA polymerase block transcription (Selby and Sancar, 1990), little is known about the effect of UV damage in regulatory regions on formation of the initiation complex. In the case of the LTL construct, blockage of transcription may occur at the initiation of transcription, since most of the transcribed region is GC-rich and there is a clear bias for CPD formation in the LTR promotor (Fig. 3). In the receptor-binding domain of LTR, a nucleosome precisely positions two of the four GREs, which are accessible to the hormone-receptor complex (Beato et al., 1991). Furthermore, KMnO4 interference studies indicate that receptor binding is very sensitive to modification of two thymidines in the TGTTCT motifs within the GRE (Truss et al., 1990). Thus, CPD formation in this region may alter hormone-receptor binding, which is required for the induction of transcription. Experiments are currently underway to test this hypothesis. This study was undertaken with the expectation of finding enhanced repair of CPDs in LTL in the transcriptionally induced state and a lower rate of repair in the uninduced state (see Introduction). However, even when transcription is induced greater than 50-fold from a very low constitutive level, there is no increase observed in the overall rate of repair of the LTL sequence, and equivalent rates of repair are observed for both the transcribed and nontranscribed strands (Fig. 8). 2Lower values for the extent of repair of LTL were initially calculated for these cells (Murad, 1991; Smerdon et al., 1993); however, further analysis at lower UV doses and repeat analysis of previous data indicate a higher level of repair occurs, while confirming the lack of transcription-coupled repair. The efficient repair of both strands of LTL is not due to background replicative synthesis, since isolation of unreplicated DNA (by the density-shift technique) and inhibition of replicative synthesis (with hydroxyurea) during repair yield similar results as untreated cells (e.g.Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the removal of CPDs occurs rapidly in the transcribed strand of c-abl, much more than in the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 7B) or either strand of the inactive J chain gene (Fig. 8). Therefore, transcription-coupled repair occurs in these cells. Furthermore, the nontranscribed strand of c-abl and both strands of the J chain gene are inefficiently repaired in the presence or absence of hormone (Figure 7:, Figure 8:). Thus, although we observe very efficient repair in both strands of the LTL insert (not coupled to transcription), transcription-repair coupling exists in other genes in these cells, in agreement with numerous studies on pol II genes (e.g. see Hanawalt and Mellon, 1993; Friedberg et al., 1994). Northern blots showed no (measurable) transcripts from the nontranscribed strand of the tk gene (data not shown). This was the case for probes to either the tk or LTR sequences. Furthermore, a dsDNA probe to the entire LTL yielded only the 1.6- and 3.8-kb transcripts of the tk gene. Therefore, it is unlikely that efficient repair of the nontranscribed strand of the tk gene results from transcription of sequences in that strand of LTL (although it is possible that regions very close to the LTL insert are transcribed). The lack of transcription-repair coupling in LTL most likely reflects either (a) the strong bias of CPD formation in the LTR promotor or (b) some unique feature(s) of the LTR chromatin. If the 4-fold bias (discussed earlier) of CPD formation in the LTR promotor occurs in intact cells, a 6:1 ratio of CPDs in LTR over tk gene would be expected (for the three LTR and two tk sequences in LTL). Thus, repair of CPDs in LTL may reflect primarily repair of the LTR promotor, and this region may lack transcription-repair coupling while the tk gene does not. Alternatively, the LTL insert may have unique features in the mouse chromatin, which “influence” the efficiency of repair enzymes. These features could reflect an unusual primary structure of the viral sequences in LTL (e.g. no introns), and/or the chromatin position in which the LTL has inserted. Indeed, the rate of DNase I digestion of LTL chromatin in the absence of dexamethasone is greater than for the J chain gene (Zaret and Yamamoto, 1984), indicating that LTL DNA may be in a “poised” chromatin configuration even in the absence of tk transcription. Thus, the LTL construct may have inserted into a very efficiently repaired region, and its repair is modulated by adjacent chromatin structure (analogous to position effect variegation). Finally, we have shown that the rate of DNA repair at specific CPD sites in a yeast minichromosome varies markedly (Smerdon and Thoma, 1990). Five different transcripts are made from this minichromosome, and four of the five templates show a good correlation between rate of transcription and rate of repair (Bedoyan et al., 1992; Smerdon et al., 1993). The fifth template region, however, is transcribed very weakly and, yet, is repaired very rapidly (Bedoyan et al., 1992; Smerdon et al., 1993). This region of the minichromosome was found to contain two very unstable nucleosomes in water (i.e. the conditions used for repair experiments; Bedoyan et al., 1992). Thus, the specific chromatin structure of the MMTV-LTR may also affect the coupling of repair and transcription in the LTL construct. We thank Drs.
