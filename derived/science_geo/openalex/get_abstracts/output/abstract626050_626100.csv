https://openalex.org/W2908930063,"The increasing prevalence of diabetes has resulted in a global epidemic1. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and amputation of lower limbs. These are often caused by changes in blood vessels, such as the expansion of the basement membrane and a loss of vascular cells2-4. Diabetes also impairs the functions of endothelial cells5 and disturbs the communication between endothelial cells and pericytes6. How dysfunction of endothelial cells and/or pericytes leads to diabetic vasculopathy remains largely unknown. Here we report the development of self-organizing three-dimensional human blood vessel organoids from pluripotent stem cells. These human blood vessel organoids contain endothelial cells and pericytes that self-assemble into capillary networks that are enveloped by a basement membrane. Human blood vessel organoids transplanted into mice form a stable, perfused vascular tree, including arteries, arterioles and venules. Exposure of blood vessel organoids to hyperglycaemia and inflammatory cytokines in vitro induces thickening of the vascular basement membrane. Human blood vessels, exposed in vivo to a diabetic milieu in mice, also mimic the microvascular changes found in patients with diabetes. DLL4 and NOTCH3 were identified as key drivers of diabetic vasculopathy in human blood vessels. Therefore, organoids derived from human stem cells faithfully recapitulate the structure and function of human blood vessels and are amenable systems for modelling and identifying the regulators of diabetic vasculopathy, a disease that affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2910387602,"Recent advances in photoredox catalysis have made it possible to achieve various challenging synthetic transformations, polymerizations and surface modifications1-3. All of these reactions require ultraviolet- or visible-light stimuli; however, the use of visible-light irradiation has intrinsic challenges. For example, the penetration of visible light through most reaction media is very low, leading to problems in large-scale reactions. Moreover, reactants can compete with photocatalysts for the absorption of incident light, limiting the scope of the reactions. These problems can be overcome by the use of near-infrared light, which has a much higher penetration depth through various media, notably biological tissue4. Here we demonstrate various photoredox transformations under infrared radiation by utilizing the photophysical process of triplet fusion upconversion, a mechanism by which two low-energy photons are converted into a higher-energy photon. We show that this is a general strategy applicable to a wide range of photoredox reactions. We tune the upconversion components to adjust the output light, accessing both orange light and blue light from low-energy infrared light, by pairwise manipulation of the sensitizer and annihilator. We further demonstrate that the annihilator itself can be used as a photocatalyst, thus simplifying the reaction. This approach enables catalysis of high-energy transformations through several opaque barriers using low-energy infrared light."
https://openalex.org/W2910837103,"Architected materials that consist of periodic arrangements of nodes and struts are lightweight and can exhibit combinations of properties (such as negative Poisson ratios) that do not occur in conventional solids. Architected materials reported previously are usually constructed from identical ‘unit cells’ arranged so that they all have the same orientation. As a result, when loaded beyond the yield point, localized bands of high stress emerge, causing catastrophic collapse of the mechanical strength of the material. This ‘post-yielding collapse’ is analogous to the rapid decreases in stress associated with dislocation slip in metallic single crystals. Here we use the hardening mechanisms found in crystalline materials to develop architected materials that are robust and damage-tolerant, by mimicking the microscale structure of crystalline materials—such as grain boundaries, precipitates and phases. The crystal-inspired mesoscale structures in our architected materials are as important for their mechanical properties as are crystallographic microstructures in metallic alloys. Our approach combines the hardening principles of metallurgy and architected materials, enabling the design of materials with desired properties. Inspired by the enhanced mechanical strength of microstructured metals, damage-tolerant architected materials are developed in which the internal structure is granular, with different regions having different lattice orientations."
https://openalex.org/W3100453682,"The discovery of a repeating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) source, FRB 121102, eliminated models involving cataclysmic events for this source. No other repeating FRB has yet been detected in spite of many recent FRB discoveries and follow-ups, suggesting repeaters may be rare in the FRB population. Here we report the detection of six repeat bursts from FRB 180814.J0422+73, one of the 13 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project during its pre-commissioning phase in July and August 2018. These repeat bursts are consistent with originating from a single position on the sky, with the same dispersion measure (DM), ~189 pc cm-3. This DM is approximately twice the expected Milky Way column density, and implies an upper limit on the source redshift of 0.1, at least a factor of ~2 closer than FRB 121102. In some of the repeat bursts, we observe sub-pulse frequency structure, drifting, and spectral variation reminiscent of that seen in FRB 121102, suggesting similar emission mechanisms and/or propagation effects. This second repeater, found among the first few CHIME/FRB discoveries, suggests that there exists -- and that CHIME/FRB and other wide-field, sensitive radio telescopes will find -- a substantial population of repeating FRBs."

https://openalex.org/W3106113684,"Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are highly dispersed millisecond-duration radio flashes probably arriving from far outside the Milky Way1,2. This phenomenon was discovered at radio frequencies near 1.4 gigahertz and so far has been observed in one case3 at as high as 8 gigahertz, but not at below 700 megahertz in spite of substantial searches at low frequencies4-7. Here we report detections of 13 FRBs at radio frequencies as low as 400 megahertz, on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) using the CHIME/FRB instrument8. They were detected during a telescope pre-commissioning phase, when the sensitivity and field of view were not yet at design specifications. Emission in multiple events is seen down to 400 megahertz, the lowest radio frequency to which the telescope is sensitive. The FRBs show various temporal scattering behaviours, with the majority detectably scattered, and some apparently unscattered to within measurement uncertainty even at our lowest frequencies. Of the 13 reported here, one event has the lowest dispersion measure yet reported, implying that it is among the closest yet known, and another has shown multiple repeat bursts, as described in a companion paper9. The overall scattering properties of our sample suggest that FRBs as a class are preferentially located in environments that scatter radio waves more strongly than in the diffuse interstellar medium in the Milky Way."
https://openalex.org/W2908844519,"Categorically distinct basic drives (for example, for social versus feeding behaviour1–3) can exert potent influences on each other; such interactions are likely to have important adaptive consequences (such as appropriate regulation of feeding in the context of social hierarchies) and can become maladaptive (such as in clinical settings involving anorexia). It is known that neural systems regulating natural and adaptive caloric intake, and those regulating social behaviours, involve related circuitry4–7, but the causal circuit mechanisms of these drive adjudications are not clear. Here we investigate the causal role in behaviour of cellular-resolution experience-specific neuronal populations in the orbitofrontal cortex, a major reward-processing hub that contains diverse activity-specific neuronal populations that respond differentially to various aspects of caloric intake8–13 and social stimuli14,15. We coupled genetically encoded activity imaging with the development and application of methods for optogenetic control of multiple individually defined cells, to both optically monitor and manipulate the activity of many orbitofrontal cortex neurons at the single-cell level in real time during rewarding experiences (caloric consumption and social interaction). We identified distinct populations within the orbitofrontal cortex that selectively responded to either caloric rewards or social stimuli, and found that activity of individually specified naturally feeding-responsive neurons was causally linked to increased feeding behaviour; this effect was selective as, by contrast, single-cell resolution activation of naturally social-responsive neurons inhibited feeding, and activation of neurons responsive to neither feeding nor social stimuli did not alter feeding behaviour. These results reveal the presence of potent cellular-level subnetworks within the orbitofrontal cortex that can be precisely engaged to bidirectionally control feeding behaviours subject to, for example, social influences. Distinct but partially overlapping subsets of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of mice respond to feeding and/or social stimuli and, when optogenetically stimulated at single-cell resolution, specifically regulate reward-seeking behaviours."

https://openalex.org/W2910624744,"Endochondral ossification, an important process in vertebrate bone formation, is highly dependent on correct functioning of growth plate chondrocytes1. Proliferation of these cells determines longitudinal bone growth and the matrix deposited provides a scaffold for future bone formation. However, these two energy-dependent anabolic processes occur in an avascular environment1,2. In addition, the centre of the expanding growth plate becomes hypoxic, and local activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α is necessary for chondrocyte survival by unidentified cell-intrinsic mechanisms3-6. It is unknown whether there is a requirement for restriction of HIF-1α signalling in the other regions of the growth plate and whether chondrocyte metabolism controls cell function. Here we show that prolonged HIF-1α signalling in chondrocytes leads to skeletal dysplasia by interfering with cellular bioenergetics and biosynthesis. Decreased glucose oxidation results in an energy deficit, which limits proliferation, activates the unfolded protein response and reduces collagen synthesis. However, enhanced glutamine flux increases α-ketoglutarate levels, which in turn increases proline and lysine hydroxylation on collagen. This metabolically regulated collagen modification renders the cartilaginous matrix more resistant to protease-mediated degradation and thereby increases bone mass. Thus, inappropriate HIF-1α signalling results in skeletal dysplasia caused by collagen overmodification, an effect that may also contribute to other diseases involving the extracellular matrix such as cancer and fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2952328530,"Spliceosomal introns are ubiquitous non-coding RNAs that are typically destined for rapid debranching and degradation. Here we describe 34 excised introns in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that-despite being rapidly degraded in log-phase growth-accumulate as linear RNAs under either saturated-growth conditions or other stresses that cause prolonged inhibition of TORC1, which is a key integrator of growth signalling. Introns that become stabilized remain associated with components of the spliceosome and differ from other spliceosomal introns in having a short distance between their lariat branch point and 3' splice site, which is necessary and sufficient for their stabilization. Deletion of these unusual introns is disadvantageous in saturated conditions and causes aberrantly high growth rates in yeast that are chronically challenged with the TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. The reintroduction of native or engineered stable introns suppresses this aberrant rapamycin response. Thus, excised introns function within the TOR growth-signalling network of S. cerevisiae and, more generally, excised spliceosomal introns can have biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2909038511,"Introduction Tibial stress fractures are a common overuse injury resulting from the accumulation of bone microdamage due to repeated loading. Researchers and wearable device developers have sought to understand or predict stress fracture risks, and other injury risks, by monitoring the ground reaction force (GRF, the force between the foot and ground), or GRF correlates (e.g., tibial shock) captured via wearable sensors. Increases in GRF metrics are typically assumed to reflect increases in loading on internal biological structures (e.g., bones). The purpose of this study was to evaluate this assumption for running by testing if increases in GRF metrics were strongly correlated with increases in tibial compression force over a range of speeds and slopes. Methods Ten healthy individuals performed running trials while we collected GRFs and kinematics. We assessed if commonly-used vertical GRF metrics (impact peak, loading rate, active peak, impulse) were strongly correlated with tibial load metrics (peak force, impulse). Results On average, increases in GRF metrics were not strongly correlated with increases in tibial load metrics. For instance, correlating GRF impact peak and loading rate with peak tibial load resulted in r = -0.29±0.37 and r = -0.20±0.35 (inter-subject mean and standard deviation), respectively. We observed high inter-subject variability in correlations, though most coefficients were negligible, weak or moderate. Seventy-six of the 80 subject-specific correlation coefficients computed indicated that higher GRF metrics were not strongly correlated with higher tibial forces. Conclusions These results demonstrate that commonly-used GRF metrics can mislead our understanding of loading on internal structures, such as the tibia. Increases in GRF metrics should not be assumed to be an indicator of increases in tibial bone load or overuse injury risk during running. This has important implications for sports, wearable devices, and research on running-related injuries, affecting >50 scientific publications per year from 2015–2017."
https://openalex.org/W2910736055,"Long γ-ray bursts are associated with energetic, broad-lined, stripped-envelope supernovae1,2 and as such mark the death of massive stars. The scarcity of such events nearby and the brightness of the γ-ray burst afterglow, which dominates the emission in the first few days after the burst, have so far prevented the study of the very early evolution of supernovae associated with γ-ray bursts3. In hydrogen-stripped supernovae that are not associated with γ-ray bursts, an excess of high-velocity (roughly 30,000 kilometres per second) material has been interpreted as a signature of a choked jet, which did not emerge from the progenitor star and instead deposited all of its energy in a thermal cocoon4. Here we report multi-epoch spectroscopic observations of the supernova SN 2017iuk, which is associated with the γ-ray burst GRB 171205A. Our spectra display features at extremely high expansion velocities (around 115,000 kilometres per second) within the first day after the burst5,6. Using spectral synthesis models developed for SN 2017iuk, we show that these features are characterized by chemical abundances that differ from those observed in the ejecta of SN 2017iuk at later times. We further show that the high-velocity features originate from the mildly relativistic hot cocoon that is generated by an ultra-relativistic jet within the γ-ray burst expanding and decelerating into the medium that surrounds the progenitor star7,8. This cocoon rapidly becomes transparent9 and is outshone by the supernova emission, which starts to dominate the emission three days after the burst."
https://openalex.org/W2909916003,"Dietary, fructose-containing sugars have been strongly associated with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent studies suggest that fructose also can be produced via the polyol pathway in the liver, where it may induce hepatic fat accumulation. Moreover, fructose metabolism yields uric acid, which is highly associated with NAFLD. Here, using biochemical assays, reporter gene expression, and confocal fluorescence microscopy, we investigated whether uric acid regulates aldose reductase, a key enzyme in the polyol pathway. We evaluated whether soluble uric acid regulates aldose reductase expression both in cultured hepatocytes (HepG2 cells) and in the liver of hyperuricemic rats and whether this stimulation is associated with endogenous fructose production and fat accumulation. Uric acid dose-dependently stimulated aldose reductase expression in the HepG2 cells, and this stimulation was associated with endogenous fructose production and triglyceride accumulation. This stimulatory mechanism was mediated by uric acid-induced oxidative stress and stimulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5). Uric acid also amplified the effects of elevated glucose levels to stimulate hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation. Hyperuricemic rats exhibited elevated hepatic aldose reductase expression, endogenous fructose accumulation, and fat buildup that was significantly reduced by co-administration of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. These results suggest that uric acid generated during fructose metabolism may act as a positive feedback mechanism that stimulates endogenous fructose production by stimulating aldose reductase in the polyol pathway. Our findings suggest an amplifying mechanism whereby soft drinks rich in glucose and fructose can induce NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W2911075401,"Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by anorexia, body wasting, and muscle and adipose tissue loss, impairing patient's tolerance to anticancer treatments and survival. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects induced in mice by tumor growth alone (C26) or in combination with chemotherapy [C26 oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (oxfu)] and to evaluate the potential of moderate exercise. Oxfu administration to C26 mice exacerbated muscle wasting and triggered autophagy or mitophagy, decreased protein synthesis, and induced mitochondrial alterations. Exercise in C26 oxfu mice counteracted the loss of muscle mass and strength, partially rescuing autophagy and mitochondrial function. Nevertheless, exercise worsened survival in C26 oxfu mice in late stages of cachexia. In summary, chemotherapy further impinges on cancer-induced alterations, worsening muscle wasting. An ideal multifactorial and early intervention to prevent cancer cachexia could take advantage of exercise, improving patient's energy metabolism, mobility, and quality of life.-Ballarò, R., Beltrà, M., De Lucia, S., Pin, F., Ranjbar, K., Hulmi, J.

https://openalex.org/W2908691578,"Invadopodia are cell protrusions that mediate cancer cell extravasation but the microenvironmental cues and signaling factors that induce invadopodia formation during extravasation remain unclear. Using intravital imaging and loss of function experiments, we determined invadopodia contain receptors involved in chemotaxis, namely GABA receptor and EGFR. These chemotaxis capabilities are mediated in part by PAK1 which controls invadopodia responsiveness to ligands such as GABA and EGF via assembly, stability, and turnover of invadopodia in vivo. PAK1 knockdown rendered cells unresponsive to chemotactic stimuli present in the stroma, resulting in dramatically lower rates of cancer cell extravasation and metastatic colony formation compared to stimulated cancer cells. In an experimental mouse model of brain metastasis, inhibition of PAK1 significantly reduced overall tumor burden and reduced the average size of brain metastases. In summary, invadopodia contain chemotaxis receptors that can respond to microenvironmental cues to guide cancer cell extravasation, and when PAK1 is depleted, brain tropism of metastatic breast cancer cells is significantly reduced, blocking secondary colony growth at sites otherwise permissive for metastatic outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2909096837,"mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a major regulator of cell growth and proliferation that coordinates nutrient inputs with anabolic and catabolic processes. Amino acid signals are transmitted to mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which directly recruit mTORC1 onto the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. The Rag GTPase heterodimer has a unique architecture that consists of two GTPase subunits, RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD. Their nucleotide-loading states are strictly controlled by several lysosomal or cytosolic protein complexes that directly detect and transmit the amino acid signals. GATOR1 (GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity toward Rags-1), a negative regulator of the cytosolic branch of the nutrient-sensing pathway, comprises three subunits, Depdc5 (DEP domain–containing protein 5), Nprl2 (NPR2-like GATOR1 complex subunit), and Nprl3 (NPR3-like GATOR1 complex subunit), and is a GAP for RagA. GATOR1 binds the Rag GTPases via two modes: an inhibitory mode that holds the Rag GTPase heterodimer and has previously been captured by structural determination, and a GAP mode that stimulates GTP hydrolysis by RagA but remains structurally elusive. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, GTP hydrolysis assays, coimmunoprecipitation experiments, and structural analysis, we probed the GAP mode and found that a critical residue on Nprl2, Arg-78, is the arginine finger that carries out GATOR1's GAP function. Substitutions of this arginine residue rendered mTORC1 signaling insensitive to amino acid starvation and are found frequently in cancers such as glioblastoma.

https://openalex.org/W2908784365,"Activation of the NACHT, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domains-containing protein 3 (collectively known as NLRP3) inflammasome plays a key role in host immune response, which is the first line of defense against cellular stresses and pathogen infections. However, excessive inflammasome activation damages host cells, and therefore it must be precisely controlled. Here, we discover that Cullin1 (CUL1), a key component of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box E3 ligase, plays a critical role in controlling the NLRP3 inflammasome. CUL1 represses inflammasome assembly in cultured cells, suppresses NLRP3 function in human monocytic cell line macrophages, and attenuates inflammatory responses in mouse model. Detailed studies demonstrate that CUL1 interacts with NLRP3 and promotes NLRP3 ubiquitination, but not protein degradation, to repress the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, upon inflammatory stimuli, including ATP and nigericin treatments, CUL1 disassociates from NLRP3 to release the repression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, this study reveals a distinct and unique mechanism underlying the control of systematic activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.—Wan, P., Zhang, Q., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Ai, S., Wang, T., Wang, W., Pan, P., Yang, G., Xiang, Q., Huang, S., Yang, Q., Zhang, W., Liu, F., Tan, Q., Zhang, W., Wu, K., Liu, Y., Wu, J.

In the present study, we aimed to characterize the immunological features of primary UM cancer and to provide an association with prognostic markers and outcome. Also, we assessed the influence of the microenvironment on the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoints in UM. Genes of interest included MHC Class I and Class II molecules, as well as inhibitory immune-checkpoints, i.e. PDL1, PDL2, B7-H3, B7-H4, TBFRSF6B, CD47, CD155, GAL9, HVEM and CD200. We observed significant lower levels of MHC genes in UM cells as compared to normal uveal melanocytes. Unexpectedly however, the expression levels of most of the analyzed inhibitory immune-checkpoint genes were not different in cancer cells as compared to normal melanocytes, with the exception of CD200 and HVEM, that resulted significantly reduced. On the other hand, PDL1 inversely correlated with OS, PFS and thickness of the tumor. Also, PDL1, along with PDL2, expression significantly increased under inflammatory conditions. Finally, for the first time, we propose a possible role for CD47 in the immune evasive properties of UM. We show here that CD47 is significantly upregulated by UM cells following inflammatory stimuli and that it represents a good independent predictor of disease progression. The results from this study may propel advances in the development of immune-based therapies for UM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2908772491,"The embryonic gut tube is a cylindrical structure from which the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts develop1. Although the early emergence of the endoderm as an epithelial sheet2,3 and later morphogenesis of the definitive digestive and respiratory organs4–6 have been investigated, the intervening process of gut tube formation remains relatively understudied7,8. Here we investigate the molecular control of macroscopic forces underlying early morphogenesis of the gut tube in the chick embryo. The gut tube has been described as forming from two endodermal invaginations—the anterior intestinal portal (AIP) towards the rostral end of the embryo and the caudal intestinal portal (CIP) at the caudal end—that migrate towards one another, internalizing the endoderm until they meet at the yolk stalk (umbilicus in mammals)1,6. Migration of the AIP to form foregut has been descriptively characterized8,9, but the hindgut is likely to form by a distinct mechanism that has not been fully explained10. We find that the hindgut is formed by collective cell movements through a stationary CIP, rather than by movement of the CIP itself. Further, combining in vivo imaging, biophysics and mathematical modelling with molecular and embryological approaches, we identify a contractile force gradient that drives cell movements in the hindgut-forming endoderm, enabling tissue-scale posterior extension of the forming hindgut tube. The force gradient, in turn, is established in response to a morphogenic gradient of fibroblast growth factor signalling. As a result, we propose that an important positive feedback arises, whereby contracting cells draw passive cells from low to high fibroblast growth factor levels, recruiting them to contract and pull more cells into the elongating hindgut. In addition to providing insight into the early gut development, these findings illustrate how large-scale tissue level forces can be traced to developmental signals during vertebrate morphogenesis. Cell-labelling experiments are used to demonstrate that the hindgut in the chick embryo is formed by cells moving through the stationary caudal intestinal portal as a result of a contractile force gradient directed by fibroblast growth factor signalling."

This park thus presents a valuable and rare opportunity to monitor long-term trends and baseline variability of native bees in natural habitats. Fifteen years after a species inventory marked Pinnacles as a biodiversity hotspot for native bees, we resurveyed these native bee communities over two flowering seasons using a systematic, plot-based design. Combining results, we report a total of 450 bee species within this 109km2 natural area of California, including 48 new species records as of 2012 and 95 species not seen since 1999. As far as we are aware, this species richness marks Pinnacles National Park as one of the most densely diverse places known for native bees. We explore patterns of bee diversity across this protected landscape, compare results to other surveyed natural areas, and highlight the need for additional repeated inventories in protected areas over time amid widespread concerns of bee declines."

In the formation of fluorescent jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a complexes, calcium binding is followed by rate-limiting isomerization.

Red GECIs (RGECIs) follow the design of GCaMPs because they are composed of a cp red fluorescent protein (cpRFP) that is fused to the smooth muscle myosin light-chain kinase peptide RS20 at its N terminus and to calmodulin (CaM) at its C terminus. The RGECO variants are based on the cp mApple, whereas the RCaMPs contain cp mRuby, with the exception of R-CaMPs, which are also based on cp mApple (9Inoue M. Takeuchi A. Horigane S. Ohkura M.

Probes that are based on mApple usually show higher dynamic range; however, excitation by blue light leads to photoswitching, generating a fluorescence output that can lead to artifacts (7Akerboom J.

We have drawn up a “family tree” of GECIs and derived variants to provide an overview of the mutation sites and lineage of probe development (Fig. 1). Because of the core cpFP, without Ca2+, the intrinsic chromophore exists mostly in its protonated neutral state that shows no fluorescence. Upon Ca2+ binding to CaM, a hydrophobic interface is exposed that binds to the RS20 peptide forcing changes in the conformation of the β-barrel structure of the cpRFP, leading to deprotonation of the chromophore and formation of the anionic state that has high fluorescence emission. Previous studies on GCaMP3 and GCaMP6f showed slow fluorescence rise and decay in response to Ca2+ concentration changes, to a large extent caused by the steric constraints imposed by cpFP interjecting between CaM and the RS20 peptide as well as their strong binding with a Kd in the nanomolar range (20Török K.

In both models Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe of CaM is mandatory for the formation of a fluorescent state, whereas C-lobe activation that involves slow Ca2+ binding to the C-lobe as the initial step, followed by Ca2+ binding to the N-lobe, is only included in a pathway in one of the models (21Sun X.R.

However, little is known about the mechanism of RGECIs, and there are no variants with improved kinetic properties available yet. Following the same design principle that led to GCaMP3fast and GCaMP6fu (23Helassa N. Zhang X.H. Conte I. Scaringi J. Esposito E. Bradley J. Carter T. Ogden D. Morad M. Török K.

Specific mutations were introduced in the CaM EF hands to disable the Ca2+ sites (termed EF-1 to EF-4 according to the mutated hand) and the W4Y mutation in the RS20 target sequence (termed RS-1). The novel variant RGECI probes were analyzed in detail and showed significantly faster transients than their parental variants in ATP-stimulated HEK293T cells. To obtain information about the mechanism of the formation and decay of the highly fluorescent state, the Ca2+ response kinetics were analyzed in detail. The results offer a deeper insight into the mechanisms and the effects of the mutations on them for better understanding of GECI and the rational design of new and faster probes. Following our hypothesis that weakening the interaction of CaM and RS20 will generate probes with faster kinetics, we disabled single EF hands of CaM by mutating the first conserved aspartate into alanine (25Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D.

In total, nine jRGECO1a and nine jRCaMP1a variants were generated in which the RS-1 mutation and/or one of the four EF-hand mutations were present. The parent and variant proteins were heterologously expressed, purified, and biophysically characterized. Two variants of each jRGECO1a: jRGECO1a EF-1 (f-RGECO1) and jRGECO1a RS-1 EF-4 (f-RGECO2) and jRCaMP1a: jRCaMP1a RS-1 (f-RCaMP1) and jRCaMP1a EF-3 (f-RCaMP2) with the fastest decay were examined in HEK293T cells and hippocampal CA3 neurons for reporting Ca2+ dynamics. The kinetics of the fast jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a variants were determined in detail and where possible an analytical solution was found. The remaining 14 variants are shown in the supporting information (Figs. S2-S9 and Tables S1-S2). In the absorption spectrum the excitation peak for Ca2+-dependent fluorescence was ∼570 nm for all RGECIs. For Ca2+-bound jRGECO1a and its variants, the peak wavelength was 562 nm with a shoulder at 530 nm. The absorption maximum for Ca2+-bound jRCaMP1a and variants lay at 570 nm with a shoulder at 538 nm (Fig. S1). For both jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a, the peak at ∼570 nm corresponds to the anionic state of the chromophore, more prominent in the presence of Ca2+. The absorption peak at 450 nm in the absence of Ca2+ is assigned to the neutral state of the chromophore for all RGECIs (28Barnett L.M. Hughes T.E. Drobizhev M. Deciphering the molecular mechanism responsible for GCaMP6m's Ca2+-dependent change in fluorescence.PLoS One. 2017; 12 (28182677)e017093410.1371/journal.pone.0170934Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of the fluorescence enhancement for jRGECO1a- and jRCaMP1a-type GECI derived from an increase of the extinction coefficient with fluorescence quantum yield increasing <2-fold by Ca2+ binding (Table 1). Fluorescence dynamic ranges (F+Ca2+/F−Ca2+) were determined from three different kinds of measurement: (i) the emission spectra, (ii) Ca2+ equilibrium titrations, and (iii) the ratio of brightness values from quantum yield and extinction coefficient measurements, and were in good agreement (Table 1). Taking all these measurements into account, the following average dynamic range values were obtained: 14 ± 3 for jRGECO1a, 10 ± 5 for f-RGECO1, and 14 ± 5 for f-RGECO2. jRCaMP1a and its variants had in general lower dynamic range values with 7 ± 3 for jRCaMP1a, 6 ± 1 for f-RCaMP1, and 6 ± 2 for f-RCaMP2. Thus, the mutations making the probes faster had no adverse effect on the fluorescence dynamic range (Table 2).Table 1Summary of pKa, quantum yield Φ, extinction coefficient ɛo, and brightness of RGECI variants Open table in a new tab Table 2Dynamic range, Kd, Hill coefficient n, and limiting rate constants of RGECI variants Open table in a new tab pKa values for jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a and their variants were determined from the pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Figs. S1, C and D, S2, and S3 and Table S1). For jRGECO1a and f-RGECO1, the pKa values at saturating Ca2+ were 6.4 ± 0.1 and 6.6 ± 0.1. The RS-1 EF-4 mutation shifted the pKa to 7.4 ± 0.1. In the absence of Ca2+, the pKa values of jRGECO1a and its variants were ∼8.5 ± 0.2. A more detailed look at the pH dependences of jRGECO1a variants in the absence of Ca2+ revealed increasing fluorescence intensity with the pH almost reaching the value measured in 1 mm CaCl2 at pH 10 (Fig. S2). For the jRCaMP1a variants all Ca2+-saturated pKa values were 6.5 ± 0.2, and in the absence of Ca2+ pKa = 7.5 ± 0.2. In contrast to jRGECO1a, normalized fluorescence for jRCaMP1a and its variants in the absence of Ca2+ remained low across the pH range (Fig. S3). The differences in the pH dependences in the absence of Ca2+ are thus based on the intrinsic properties of the cp red fluorescent proteins derived from mApple and mRuby (supporting sequence alignment). The EF-hand mutations disabled Ca2+ binding in one of the binding motifs (25Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M. Davis T.N.

Thus, the mutations were expected to affect the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, for Ca2+. The dissociation constants of jRGECO1a and jRCaMP1a and their fast-decay variants were determined by titrations in BAPTA (see “Experimental procedures”). jRGECO1a had a high affinity for Ca2+ with a Kd of 161 ± 2 nm and a Hill coefficient n of 1.8 ± 0.1 measured (Fig. 2A and Table 2), similar to the reported values (148 nm Kd and n of 1.9 (8Dana H.

The Kd values for f-RGECO1 and f-RGECO2 were increased to 1.2 ± 0.2 and 1.3 ± 0.1 μm, respectively, with higher cooperativity shown by Hill coefficients n of 3.0 ± 0.2 and 5.8 ± 0.3. jRCaMP1a has been reported to have a strong affinity for Ca2+ (Kd of 214 nm) with an essentially linear response to Ca2+ (Hill coefficient of 0.9 (8Dana H.

In our measurements the binding was even a bit stronger with a Kd of 141 ± 3 nm and also more cooperative with a Hill coefficient of 1.5 ± 0.1 (Fig. 2B and Table 2). Both the f-RCaMP1 and f-RCaMP2 mutations slightly lowered the affinity and increased the cooperativity with Kd of 520 ± 12 and 785 ± 12 nm, respectively, and Hill coefficients of 2.3 ± 0.1 and 3.5 ± 0.2. The range of EF-hand and/or peptide mutations thus decreased the affinity between 5- and 10-fold and also increased the cooperativity (Fig. S4). Representative records obtained at saturating [Ca2+] (20 μm) at 37 °C show monophasic fluorescence rises with limiting rates (kon(lim)) of 544 ± 5 s−1 for jRGECO1a and 100 ± 1 s−1 for f-RGECO1 (Fig. 2C). f-RGECO2 had biphasic on-kinetics with kon(lim) of 457 ± 7 and 86 ± 2 s−1, with relative amplitudes of 65 and 35%, respectively. Thus, the mutations applied did not improve the rise kinetics for f-RGECO1, whereas f-RGECO2 fast phase had similar kinetics to its parental GECI. The dissociation rate for jRGECO1a at 37 °C was 14.1 ± 0.1 s−1. f-RGECO1 and f-RGECO2 had 8-fold faster off rates of 109 ± 1 and 108 ± 1 s−1, respectively (Fig. 2E). The association kinetics of jRCaMP1a variants were all biphasic at 37 °C, revealing the formation of two fluorescent states (Fig. 2D). Rates obtained at saturating [Ca2+], kon(lim) for jRCaMP1a were 153 ± 7 and 4.0 ± 0.1 s−1 with relative amplitudes of 19 and 81%, respectively. f-RCaMP1 showed similar rates of 152 ± 2 s−1 and 12 ± 1 s−1, but with the faster rate representing the majority of the relative amplitude of 68%. f-RCaMP2 association kinetics were a bit slower with limiting rates of 64 ± 2 and 5.2 ± 0.1 s−1 and amplitudes of 35 and 65%, respectively. The Ca2+ off-kinetics of the two new fast variants of jRCaMP1a were biexponential, both showing faster decay rates (koff) compared with their parental probe. For jRCaMP1a the dissociation rates at 37 °C were 5.8 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.1 s−1 with relative amplitudes of 35 and 65%, respectively (Fig. 2F). f-RCaMP1 had a three times faster rate of 15.8 ± 0.1 s−1 and a similar slow rate of 1.4 ± 0.1. However, the fast rate represented the majority of the relative amplitude with 78%. For f-RCaMP2 koff was 4-fold faster with a value of 21 ± 1 s−1 (86%) and a slower rate of 0.9 ± 0.1 s−1 (14%). Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and fluorescence dynamic ranges (ΔF/F0) of RGECIs and their fast-decay variants were monitored in ATP-stimulated HEK293T cells. After stimulation the fluorescence rapidly rises and then decays over several seconds. The data were fitted with monoexponential decays resulting in time constants τ of 42 ± 2 s for jRGECO1a, 31 ± 2 s for f-RGECO1, and 5.0 ± 0.5 s f-RGECO2, with ΔF/F0 of 0.81 ± 0.37, 0.59 ± 0.25, and 0.29 ± 0.20, respectively (Fig. 2G). For the jRCaMP1a variants the obtained time constants τ were 17.5 ± 0.3 s for jRCaMP1a, 10.4 ± 0.7 s for f-RCaMP1, and 6.0 ± 0.6 s for f-RCaMP2, with ΔF/F0 of 1.00 ± 0.50, 0.42 ± 0.26, and 0.14 ± 0.06, respectively (Fig. 2H). Thus, faster response kinetics enabled the RGECI variants to more faithfully report Ca2+ dynamics in the cells. The novel fast variants were expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices. Backpropagating action potentials (bAP) were induced by somatic current injections and the Ca2+ transients simultaneously optically recorded from a single spine with two-photon imaging (Fig. 3, A and B).

A study of health seeking behaviour of DR-TB patients in such a situation, offers an opportunity to understand the problems patients face while interacting with health systems.Forty-six DR-TB patients drawn from 15 high TB burden wards in Mumbai were interviewed using an open ended interview tool. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. Pathway schematics developed from analysis of patient records, were linked to transcripts. Open coding was used to analyse these units and themes were derived after collating the codes.The paper presents themes interwoven with narratives in the discussions. These include awareness-action gap among patients, role of neighbourhood providers, responsiveness of health systems, the not-such a 'merry go round' that patients go/are made to go on while seeking care, costs of diagnostics and treatment, and how DR-TB is viewed as the 'big TB'.The recommendations are based on a preventative ethos which is sustainable, compared to interventions with top-down approaches, which get piloted, but fail to sustain impact when scaled up."
https://openalex.org/W2909136159,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive cancer with limited therapeutic options and treatment efficiency. Even if the latency period between asbestos exposure, the main risk factor, and mesothelioma development is very long, the local invasion of mesothelioma is very rapid leading to a mean survival of one year after diagnosis. ADAM10 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) sheddase targets membrane-bound substrates and its overexpression is associated with progression in several cancers. However, nothing is known about ADAM10 implication in MPM. In this study, we demonstrated higher ADAM10 expression levels in human MPM as compared to control pleural samples and in human MPM cell line. This ADAM10 overexpression was also observed in murine MPM samples. Two mouse mesothelioma cell lines were used in this study including one primary cell line obtained by repeated asbestos fibre injections. We show, in vitro, that ADAM10 targeting through shRNA and pharmacological (GI254023X) approaches reduced drastically mesothelioma cell migration and invasion, as well as for human mesothelioma cells treated with siRNA targeting ADAM10. Moreover, ADAM10 downregulation in murine mesothelioma cells significantly impairs MPM progression in vivo after intrapleural cell injection. We also demonstrate that ADAM10 sheddase downregulation decreases the production of a soluble N-cadherin fragment through membrane N-cadherin, which stimulated mesothelioma cell migration. Taken together, we demonstrate that ADAM10 is overexpressed in MPM and takes part to MPM progression through the generation of N-cadherin fragment that stimulates mesothelioma cell migration. ADAM10 inhibition is worth considering as a therapeutic perspective in mesothelioma context."
https://openalex.org/W2911051601,"The melanocytic lineage, which is prominently exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and radiation-independent oxidative damage, requires specific DNA-damage response mechanisms to maintain genomic and transcriptional homeostasis. The coordinate lineage-specific regulation of intricately intertwined DNA repair and transcription is incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that the Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) directly controls general transcription and UVR-induced nucleotide excision repair by transactivation of GTF2H1 as a core element of TFIIH. Thus, MITF ensures the rapid resumption of transcription after completion of strand repair and maintains transcriptional output, which is indispensable for survival of the melanocytic lineage including melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, MITF controls c-MYC implicated in general transcription by transactivation of far upstream binding protein 2 (FUBP2/KSHRP), which induces c-MYC pulse regulation through TFIIH, and experimental depletion of MITF results in consecutive loss of CDK7 in the TFIIH-CAK subcomplex. Targeted for proteasomal degradation, CDK7 is dependent on transactivation by MITF or c-MYC to maintain a steady state. The dependence of TFIIH-CAK on sequence-specific MITF and c-MYC constitutes a previously unrecognized mechanism feeding into super-enhancer-driven or other oncogenic transcriptional circuitries, which supports the concept of a transcription-directed therapeutic intervention in melanoma."

TDF is a known nephrotoxin however, renal dysfunction from TDF is mostly reversible following discontinuation. Aims To describe the renal function, risk factors for renal disease and associated clinical testing practices in a cohort of PrEP patients. Methods A retrospective review was conducted of all PrEP patients commenced on TDF/FTC at an inner metropolitan sexual health clinic in Sydney, Australia between April 2016 and July 2017, with follow-up data obtained at 3-monthly intervals until 18 months. Results 525 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients were almost exclusively male and median age was 34 years (IQR: 28 to 42). At baseline, 1.5% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <70 mL/min/1.73m2. A small significant drop in eGFR of -2.5 mL/min/1.73m2 (p<0.05) occurred between PrEP commencement and the first follow-up period, followed by a progressive decline in eGFR of -0.38 mL/min/1.73m2 per month (95%CI: -0.57 to -0.20; p<0.001). Renal impairment (eGFR <70 mL/min/1.73m2) occurred in 6.5% of patients and persisted across consecutive follow-up periods in five (1.0%) patients. Patients aged ≥40 years had a greater risk of renal impairment than younger patients (HR 3.9, 95%CI: 1.8 to 8.4; p<0.001), despite similar rates of eGFR decline (p = 0.19). PrEP was discontinued in two patients (0.4%) due to renal function concerns. Conclusion PrEP use led to an initial drop in eGFR and a more gradual progressive decline subsequently, but significant renal impairment remained uncommon up to 18 months of follow-up."

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects linked with the long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) AK089579 on the EMT of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) as well as the associated regulatory mechanisms of AK089579 downstream of tyrosine kinase 2 (DOK2) and microRNA-296-3p (miR-296-3p). Enrichment analysis, gene intersection association analysis, and a gene-gene intersection network were initially constructed to ascertain whether AK089579 regulated the expression of DOK2 through the mediation of miR-296-3p via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in PF. After the PF mouse model had been constructed, the expression of the proteins associated with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and EMT and PMC migration and invasion were all determined accordingly. Based on the obtained results, AK089579 was determined to function as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-296-3p while acting to up-regulate the expression of DOK2, which is a target gene of miR-296-3p. AK089579 was detected to confer an inhibitory effect on the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the migration and invasion of PMCs among the mice models were suppressed. Meanwhile, up-regulated miR-296-3p and down-regulated DOK2 produced contrasting effects when compared with the aforementioned findings. Treatment with wpl0066, a JAK2/STAS3 signaling pathway inhibitor, was shown to reverse the effects exerted by up-regulated miR-296-3p. Taken together, the central findings of the current study present evidence highlighting the capability of the IncRNA AK089579 to bind competitively to miR-296-3p and indirectly enhance the expression of DOK2, which in turn suppresses the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the EMT, migration, and invasion of PMCs was inhibited in PF.—Zhang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2910892871,"Angiogenesis is a crucial defense response to hypoxia that regulates the process of raising the promise of long-term neurologic recovery during the management of stroke. A high expression of antiangiogenic factors leads to the loss of neovascularization capacity in pathologic conditions. We have previously documented an impairment of the cerebral vessel perfusion and neovascularization in the cortex neighboring the stroke-induced lesion, which was accompanied by an activation of semaphorin 3E (Sema3E)/PlexinD1 after ischemic stroke. In this study, we employed micro-optical sectioning tomography to fully investigate the details of the vascular pattern, including the capillaries. We found that after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, inhibiting PlexinD1 signaling led to an organized recovery of the vascular network in the ischemic area. We then further explored the possible mechanisms. In vivo, Sema3E substantially decreased dynamic delta-like 4 (DLL4) expression. In cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells, Sema3E down-regulated DLL4 expression via inhibiting Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1–induced JNK phosphorylation. At the microcosmic level, Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling promoted F-actin disassembly and focal adhesion reduction by activating the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog family member J by releasing RhoGEF Tuba from direct binding to PlexinD1, thus mediating endothelial cell motility and filopodia retraction. Our study reveals that Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling, which suppressed endothelial DLL4 expression, cell motility, and filopodia formation, is expected to be a novel druggable target for angiogenesis during poststroke progression.— Zhou, Y.-F., Chen, A.-Q., Wu, J.-H., Mao, L., Xia, Y.-P., Jin, H.-J., He, Q.-W., Miao, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2909412078,"Background Referral to specialized palliative care services (SPCS) occurs often late in the illness trajectory but may differ across cancer types. We examined differences between cancer types in the use and timing of referral to specialized palliative care services (SPCS) and in the reasons for non-referral. Methods We conducted a population-based mortality follow-back survey among physicians who certified a representative sample of deaths in Flanders, Belgium. We focused only on sampled death cases of cancer (n = 2392). The questionnaire asked about the use of the existing types of SPCS and the timing of referral to these services. Results Response rate was 58% (1394/2392). Patients who died from breast, respiratory, head and neck, genitourinary or gastrointestinal cancer had higher chances of using SPCS compared to hematologic cancer patients. The most prevalent reason for non-referral was that regular care sufficiently addressed palliative and supportive care needs (51%). This differed significantly between cancer types ranging from 77,8% for breast cancer and 42.1% for hematologic cancer. A second prevalent reason for not using SPCS was that it was not meaningful (enough) (23.9%), particularly for hematologic malignancies (35,1%) and only in 5.3% for breast cancer. Conclusion Differences in referral across different types of cancer were found. Referral is more often delayed or not initiated for patients with hematologic cancer, possibly due to differences in illness trajectory. An influencing reason is that physicians perceive palliative care as not meaningful or not meaningful enough for these patients which may be linked to the uncertainty in the disease trajectory of hematologic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2909000429,"Female breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common noncutaneous cancer among women in the United States. Human epidemiological studies reveal that a p53 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 72, encoding proline (P72) or arginine (R72), is associated with differential risk of several cancers, including BrCa. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these variants affect mammary tumorigenesis remain unresolved. To investigate the effects of this polymorphism on susceptibility to mammary cancer, we used a humanized p53 mouse model, homozygous for either P72 or R72. Our studies revealed that R72 mice had a significantly higher mammary tumor incidence and reduced latency in both DMBA-induced and MMTV-Erbb2/Neu mouse mammary tumor models compared to P72 mice. Analyses showed that susceptible mammary glands from E-R72 (R72 x MMTV-Erbb2/Neu) mice developed a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with influx of proinflammatory macrophages, ultimately resulting in chronic, protumorigenic inflammation. Mammary tumors arising in E-R72 mice also had an increased influx of tumor-associated macrophages, contributing to angiogenesis and elevated tumor growth rates. These results demonstrate that the p53 R72 variant increased susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis through chronic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2910037313,"The underlying forces that shape mutational patterns within any type of cancer have been poorly characterized. One of the best preserved exclusionary relationships is that between BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61) in melanomas. To explore possible mechanisms which could explain this phenomenon, we overexpressed NRAS(Q61) in a set of BRAF(V600E) melanoma lines and vice versa. Controlled expression of a second activating oncogene led to growth arrest (“synthetic suppression”) in a subset of cells, which was accompanied by cell cycle arrest and senescence in several melanoma cell lines along with apoptosis. Through differential gene expression analysis, we identified SPRY4 as the potential mediator of this synthetic response to dual oncogene suppression. Ectopic introduction of SPRY4 recapitulated the growth arrest phenotype of dual BRAF(V600E)/NRAS(Q61) expression while SPRY4 depletion led to a partial rescue from oncogenic antagonism. This study thus defined SPRY4 as a potential mediator of synthetic suppression, which is likely to contribute to the observed exclusivity between BRAF(V600E) and NRAS(Q61R) mutations in melanoma. Further leverage of the SPRY4 pathway may also hold therapeutic promise for NRAS(Q61) melanomas."

Among them are ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) which form a protein cluster around rpS0 (uS2) at the ""neck"" of the SSU (S0-cluster) and others forming a nearby protein cluster around rpS3 (uS3) at the SSU ""beak"". Here we applied semi-quantitative proteomics together with complementary biochemical approaches to study how incomplete assembly of these two r-protein clusters affects binding and release of SSU maturation factors and assembly of other r-proteins in late SSU precursors in S. cerevisiae. For each of the two clusters specific impairment of the local r-protein assembly state was observed in Rio2 associated SSU precursors. Besides, cluster-specific effects on the association of biogenesis factors were detected. These suggested a role of S0-cluster formation for the efficient release of the two nuclear export factors Rrp12 and Slx9 from SSU precursors and for the correct incorporation of the late acting biogenesis factor Rio2. Based on our and on previous results we propose the existence of at least two different r-protein assembly checkpoints during late SSU maturation in S. cerevisiae. We discuss in the light of recent SSU precursor structure models how r-protein assembly states might be sensed by biogenesis factors at the S0-cluster checkpoint."

Here, we investigated chaperone-mediated secretion switching from early to middle substrates in the T3SS encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2), essential for systemic infection. Our findings revealed that the protein encoded by ssaH regulates the secretion of an inner rod and early substrate, SsaI. Structural modeling revealed that SsaH is structurally similar to class III chaperones, known to associate with proteins in various pathogenic bacteria.

In fact, urinary tract dysfunction associated with SCI is urinary dysfunction could be a consequence of a lack of neuroregeneration of supraspinal pathways that control bladder function. The object of the current research was to explore the effects of adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate, on bladder damage generated after SCI in mice. Spinal cord was exposed via laminectomy, and SCI was induced by extradural compression at T6 to T7 level, by an aneurysm clip with a closing force of 24 g. Mice were treated intravesically with adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate daily for 48 h and 7 days after SCI. Adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced significantly mast cell degranulation and down-regulated the nuclear factor-κB pathway in the bladder after SCI both at 48 h and 7days. Moreover, adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced nerve growth factor expression, suggesting an association between neurotrophins and bladder pressure. At 7 days after SCI, the bladder was characterized by a marked bacterial infection and proteinuria; surprisingly, adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate reduced significantly both parameters. These data show the protective roles of adelmidrol + sodium hyaluronate on bladder following SCI, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for the reduction of bladder changes."

Neural network dysfunction may contribute to disease mechanisms underlying different clinical subtypes. Here, we apply resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging based measures of brain connectivity to investigate network dysfunction in severely depressed in-patients with and without psychotic symptoms.A cohort study was performed at two sites. Older patients with major depressive disorder with or without psychotic symptoms were included (n = 23 at site one, n = 26 at site two). Resting state 3-Tesla functional MRI scans, with eyes closed, were obtained and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scales were completed. We denoised data and calculated resting state networks in the two groups separately. We selected five networks of interest (1. bilateral frontoparietal, 2.left lateralized frontoparietal, 3.right lateralized frontoparietal, 4.default mode network (DMN) and 5.bilateral basal ganglia and insula network) and performed regression analyses with severity of depression, as well as presence or absence of psychotic symptoms.The functional connectivity (FC) patterns did not correlate with severity of depression. Depressed patients with psychotic symptoms (n = 14, 61%) compared with patients without psychotic symptoms (n = 9, 39%) from site one showed significantly decreased FC in the right part of the bilateral frontoparietal network (p = 0.002). This result was not replicated when comparing patients with (n = 9, 35%) and without (n = 17, 65%) psychotic symptoms from site two.Psychotic depression may be associated with decreased FC of the frontoparietal network, which is involved in cognitive control processes, such as attention and emotion regulation. These findings suggest that FC in the frontoparietal network may be related to the subtype of depression, i.e. presence of psychotic symptoms, rather than severity of depression. Since the findings could not be replicated in the 2nd sample, replication is needed before drawing definite conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2910349558,"Experimental acute lung injury models are often used to increase our knowledge on the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), however, existing animal models often do not take into account the impact of specific fluid strategies on the development of lung injury. In contrast, the current literature strongly suggests that fluid management strategies have a significant impact on clinical outcome of patients with ARDS. Thus, it is important to characterize the role of fluid management strategies in experimental models of lung injury. In this study we investigated the effect of two different fluid strategies on commonly used outcome variables in a short-term model of acute lung injury, in relation to age. Infant (2–3 weeks) and adult (3–4 months) Wistar rats received intratracheal instillations of lipopolysaccharide and 24 hours later were mechanically ventilated for 6 hours. During mechanical ventilation, rats from both age groups were randomized to either a standard or conservative intravenous fluid strategy. We found that the hemodynamic response in infant and adult rats was similar in both fluid strategies. Lung wet-to-dry ratios were lower in adult, but not in infant rats receiving the conservative fluid strategy as compared to the standard fluid strategy. There were age-related differences in markers of alveolar capillary barrier disruption and alveolar fluid clearance, yet these were unaffected by fluid strategy. Finally, we found significantly higher IL-1β and TNF-α concentrations in the adult rats treated with the conservative as compared to the standard fluid regimen. In conclusion, the choice of fluid strategy in mechanically ventilated rats with experimental LPS-induced acute lung injury has a significant effect on pulmonary extravascular water, an important and well-recognized lung injury marker, and on the local pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles. We advocate the use of a more uniform, conservative, fluid strategy regimen in experimental models of acute lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2910669354,"Internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, however their roles in mRNA regulation have only recently started to be elucidated. Here we investigated the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in transcripts from the hippocampus of HIV transgenic (Tg) rats. The distribution of m6A peaks within HIV transcripts in HIV Tg rats largely corresponded to the ones observed for HIV transcripts in cell lines and T cells. Host transcripts were found to be differentially m6A methylated in HIV Tg rats. The functional roles of the differentially m6A methylated pathways in HIV Tg rats is consistent with a key role of RNA methylation in the regulation of the brain transcriptome in chronic HIV disease. In particular, host transcripts show significant differential m6A methylation of genes involved in several pathways related to neural function, suggestive of synaptodendritic injury and neurodegeneration, inflammation and immune response, as well as RNA processing and metabolism, such as splicing. Changes in m6A methylation were usually positively correlated with differential expression, while differential m6A methylation of pathways involved in RNA processing were more likely to be negatively correlated with gene expression changes. Thus, sets of differentially m6A methylated, functionally-related transcripts appear to be involved in coordinated transcriptional responses in the context of chronic HIV. Altogether, our results support that m6A methylation represents an additional layer of regulation of HIV and host gene expression in vivo that contributes significantly to the transcriptional effects of chronic HIV."

We have previously reported a novel mono-ADP-ribosylation of H3R117, which promoted proliferation of LoVo cells. Here we showed that mono-ADP-ribosylated H3R117 of LoVo cells depressed demethylation of tumor suppressor TFPI2 promoter by suppressing TET1 expression and adjusting H3K9me3 enrichment of TFPI2 promoter to attenuate affinity of TET1, besides, since high H3K27me3 level was associated with hypermethylation, mono-ADP-ribosylated-H3R117-depended-H3K27me3 of TFPI2 promoter may contribute to hypermethylation of TFPI2. However, H3R117A mutation increased poly-ADP-ribosylated modification of TET1 promoter not TFPI2 promoter, which resulted in boosting transcription and expression of TET1 by altering DNA methylated modification, chromatin accessibility, and histone-methylated modification of TET1 promoter, while knockout TET1 of H3R117A LoVo cells directly led to hypermethylation of TFPI2 promoter and depression of TFPI2 secretion as well as enhanced proliferation, suggested that TET1 played a key role in demethylation of TFPI2, production of TFPI2, and cell proliferation. Bioinformatics analyses reveal prevalent hypermethylation of TFPI2 was an early event in tumorigenesis of colorectal caner, and expression of TET1 and TFPI2 was positive correlation in colorectal cancer and normal tissue. These data suggested that mono-ADP-ribosylation of H3R117 upregulated methylation of TFPI2 by impact TET1, since hypermethyaltion of TFPI2 was an early event in tumorigenesis, selectively target mono-ADP-ribosylation of H3R117 deficiency could be a feasible way to block tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer."

A previous study showed that the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, glucose-regulated-protein-78 (GRP78), is a potential prognostic marker for ccRCC. The present study aimed to: (1) examine whether GRP78 was upregulated in ccRCC compared with matched non-neoplastic renal tissue; and (2) investigate whether GRP78 expression in ccRCC tissue or perinephric adipose tissue has any association with ccRCC aggressiveness.A retrospective cross-sectional study of 267 patients who underwent nephrectomy for renal tumors between June 2013 and October 2017 was conducted at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Software-assisted quantification of average grey value of staining intensity (staining intensity method) and proportion of positive pixels (positive pixel method) was applied to measure expression of GRP78 in archived specimens of renal tumor tissues (n = 114), adjacent non-neoplastic renal tissues (n = 68), and perinephric adipose tissues (n = 60) in participants diagnosed with ccRCC.GRP78 was not upregulated in renal tumor tissue compared with paired normal renal tissue. In tumor tissue, GRP78 expression did not show any association with ccRCC aggressiveness using either quantification method. In adipose tissue, downregulation of GRP78 demonstrated poor correlation with increased probability of metastasis, with one unit increase in average grey value of GRP78 staining weakly correlating with a 17% increase in the odds ratio of metastasis (95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 1.38, p = 0.07).GRP78 is not valuable as a risk stratification marker for ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2909812732,"Squamous cell carcinoma–related oncogene (SCCRO, also known as DCUN1D1) is a component of the E3 for neddylation. As such, DCUN1D1 regulates the neddylation of cullin family members. Targeted inactivation of DCUN1D1 in mice results in male-specific infertility. Infertility in DCUN1D1-/- mice is secondary to primary defects in spermatogenesis. Time-dam experiments mapped the onset of the defect in spermatogenesis to 5.5 to 6 weeks of age, which temporally corresponds to defects in spermiogenesis. Although the first round of spermatogenesis progressed normally, the number of spermatozoa released into the seminiferous lumen and epididymis of DCUN1D1-/- mice was significantly reduced. Spermatozoa in DCUN1D1-/- mice had multiple abnormalities, including globozoospermia, macrocephaly, and multiple flagella. Many of the malformed spermatozoa in DCUN1D1-/- mice were multinucleated, with supernumerary and malpositioned centrioles, suggesting a defect in the resolution of intercellular bridges. The onset of the defect in spermatogenesis in DCUN1D1-/- mice corresponds to an increase in DCUN1D1 expression observed during normal spermatogenesis. Moreover, consistent with its known function as a component of the E3 in neddylation, the pattern of DCUN1D1 expression temporally correlates with an increase in the neddylated cullin fraction and stage-specific increases in the total ubiquitinated protein pool in wild-type mice. Levels of neddylated Cul3 were decreased in DCUN1D1-/- mice, and ubiquitinated proteins did not accumulate during the stages in which DCUN1D1 expression peaks during spermatogenesis in wild-type mice. Combined, these findings suggest that DCUN1D1-/- mice fail to release mature spermatozoa into the seminiferous lumen, possibly due to unresolved intercellular bridges. Furthermore, the effects of DCUN1D1 on spermatogenesis likely involve its regulation of cullin-RING-ligase (CRL)–type ubiquitin E3 activity during spermiogenesis through its role in promoting Cul3 neddylation. The specific CRLs required for spermiogenesis and their protein targets require identification."
https://openalex.org/W2908604724,"To evaluate CF800, a novel lipid-based liposomal nanoparticle that co-encapsulates indocyanine green (ICG) and iohexol, for CT imaging of pulmonary vasculature in minimally-invasive thoracic surgery planning.CF800 was intravenously administered to 7 healthy rabbits. In vivo CT imaging was performed 15 min post-injection, with a subset of animals imaged at 24h, 48h, and 72h post injection. Signal-to-background ratios (SBR) were calculated at the inferior vena cava and compared across time-points. A similar protocol was applied to 2 healthy pigs to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy in a large animal model. To evaluate the feasibility of clinical application, a survey was completed by 7 surgical trainees to assess pre- and post-injection CT images of rabbits and pigs. Responses on the discernibility of pulmonary vasculature sub-branches and comfort level to use the images for pre-operative planning were collected and analyzed.CF800 injection improved visualization of pulmonary vessels in both rabbit and pig models. The SBR of rabbit pulmonary vasculature was significantly higher after CF800 injection (range 3.7-4.4) compared to pre-injection (range 3.3-3.8, n = 7; p<0.05). SBR remained significantly different up to 24 hours after injection (range 3.7-4.3, n = 4; p<0.05). Trainees' evaluation found the post-injection CT images had significantly higher discernibility at the second vessel branch generation in both rabbit and pig models. Trainees identified smaller vasculature branch generations in the post-injection images compared to the pre-treatment images in both rabbit (mean 6.7±1.8 vs 5.4±2.1; p<0.05) and pig (mean 6.7±1.8 vs 5.4±2.1; p<0.05). Trainees were significantly more comfortable using post-injection images for surgical planning compared to the pre-injection images (rabbit: 8.1±1.1 vs. 4.7±2.1; pig: 7.6±2.1 vs. 4.9±2.2; p<0.05).CF800 provides SBR and contrast enhancement of pulmonary vasculature which may assist in pre-surgical CT planning of minimally invasive thoracic surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2910001282,"Guide rails’ nonlinear dynamic response to the collision process between gangues and the suspended buffer is the basis for its intensity examination and fatigue prediction. This paper established a numerical model for simulating the dynamic response of buffer’s guide rails using Pro/E and Femap based on an analysis of the basic structural components of the suspended buffer. The effects of the gangues diameter and feeding rate on the guide rails’ dynamic response were investigated, which were mainly revealed by a tension in guide rails. Simulation results showed that the tension in guide rails rapidly increased to a peak value after the suspended buffer was impacted by gangues, followed by a periodic vibration. The peak tension, maximum and minimum tensions within the periodic vibration were exponential functions of the gangues diameter. And they depended linearly on the feeding rate. The vibration frequency of the tension in guide rails was an exponential function of the gangues diameter but did not depend on the feeding rate. Based on the backfilling workface parameters used in D.Ping coal miner’s 15601 working panel, the feeding rate of 500 t/h was selected. The diameter of the crushed gangues was selected to be 50 mm based on the strength of guide rails. Their expected service life is 54.2 years. Finally, an industrial test was performed in D.Ping coal miner’s 15601 working panel and the guide rails operated steadily. The measured vibration parameters of the tension in guide rails agree well with that of numerical predictions, which verified the reliability of the numerical model to some extent."
https://openalex.org/W2910337166,"Protein sequences of members of the plasminogen activation system are present throughout the entire vertebrate phylum. This important and well-described proteolytic cascade is governed by numerous protease–substrate and protease–inhibitor interactions whose conservation is crucial to maintaining unchanged protein function throughout evolution. The pressure to preserve protein–protein interactions may lead to either co-conservation or covariation of binding interfaces. Here, we combined covariation analysis and structure-based prediction to analyze the binding interfaces of urokinase (uPA):plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and uPA:plasminogen complexes. We detected correlated variation between the S3-pocket–lining residues of uPA and the P3 residue of both PAI-1 and plasminogen. These residues are known to form numerous polar interactions in the human uPA:PAI-1 Michaelis complex. To test the effect of mutations that correlate with each other and have occurred during mammalian diversification on protein–protein interactions, we produced uPA, PAI-1, and plasminogen from human and zebrafish to represent mammalian and nonmammalian orthologs. Using single amino acid point substitutions in these proteins, we found that the binding interfaces of uPA:plasminogen and uPA:PAI-1 may have coevolved to maintain tight interactions. Moreover, we conclude that although the interaction areas between protease–substrate and protease–inhibitor are shared, the two interactions are mechanistically different. Compared with a protease cleaving its natural substrate, the interaction between a protease and its inhibitor is more complex and involves a more fine-tuned mechanism. Understanding the effects of evolution on specific protein interactions may help further pharmacological interventions of the plasminogen activation system and other proteolytic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2953125813,"The native octameric structure of streptococcal enolase from Streptococcus pyogenes increasingly dissociates as amino acid residues are removed one by one from the carboxy-terminus. These truncations gradually convert native octameric enolase into monomers and oligomers. In this work, we investigated how these truncations influence the interaction between Streptococcal enolase and canine plasminogen. We used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to study the interaction. The DPI was our first technique, was performed on all the truncations and used one exclusive kind of chip. The LSRP was used to show that the DPI results were not dependent on the type of chip used. The AUC was required to show that our surface results were not the result of selecting a minority population in any given sample; the majority of the protein was responsible for the binding phenomenon we observed. By comparing results from these techniques we identified one detail that is essential for streptococcal enolase to bind plasminogen: In our hands the individual monomers bind plasminogen; dimers, trimers, tetramers may or may not bind, the fully intact, native, octamer does not bind plasminogen. We also evaluated the contribution to the equilibrium constant made by surface binding as well as in solution. On a surface, the association coefficient is about twice that in solution. The difference is probably not significant. Finally, the fully octameric form of the protein that does not contain a hexa-his N-terminal peptide does not bind to a silicon oxynitride surface, does not bind to an Au-nanoparticle surface, does not bind to a surface coated with Ni-NTA nor does it bind to a surface coated with DPgn. The likelihood is great that the enolase species on the surface of Streptococcus pyogenes is an x-mer of the native octamer."

https://openalex.org/W2910545570,"In many offline studies, children show selectively better comprehension of sentences with the focus particle only when it modifies the object argument (Jane only ate an apple) than they do when it modifies the subject argument (Only Jane ate an apple). Here we explore the nature of this asymmetry by examining performance in a different kind of task: the moment-to-moment comprehension of unambiguous sentences. If past errors reflect a fundamental difference in representation or complexity of computation, we would expect the same asymmetry in this task. We observed that adults were able to successfully predict the target referent for both types of only-sentences, as indicated by anticipatory looks, while 6- to 8-year-old children could do so only for subject-modifying only-sentences. These findings suggest that much of the asymmetry in past work may be due to task demands. We discuss the implications of these results for children's syntactic and pragmatic development."
