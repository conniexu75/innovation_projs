Zener's model of ferromagnetism, originally proposed for transition metals in 1950, can explain T C of Ga 1− x Mn x As and that of its II-VI counterpart Zn 1− x Mn x Te and is used to predict materials with T C exceeding room temperature, an important step toward semiconductor electronics that use both charge and spin."

https://openalex.org/W2162665706,"The deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing human brain are poorly understood. Here it is reported that ethanol, acting by a dual mechanism [blockade of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors and excessive activation of GABA A receptors], triggers widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing rat forebrain. Vulnerability coincides with the period of synaptogenesis, which in humans extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. During this period, transient ethanol exposure can delete millions of neurons from the developing brain. This can explain the reduced brain mass and neurobehavioral disturbances associated with human fetal alcohol syndrome."

Comparison of the discrete relaxation constants measured for different multiple-pair states indicates that the carrier decay rate is cubic in carrier concentration, which is characteristic of an Auger process. We observe that in the quantum-confined regime, the Auger constant is strongly size-dependent and decreases with decreasing the quantum dot size as the radius cubed."

Mice lacking heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)–coupled PI3Kγ were viable and had fully differentiated neutrophils and macrophages. Chemoattractant-stimulated PI3Kγ −/− neutrophils did not produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, did not activate protein kinase B, and displayed impaired respiratory burst and motility. Peritoneal PI3Kγ-null macrophages showed a reduced migration toward a wide range of chemotactic stimuli and a severely defective accumulation in a septic peritonitis model. These results demonstrate that PI3Kγ is a crucial signaling molecule required for macrophage accumulation in inflammation."

Viable gene-targeted mice lacking the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3Kgamma were generated. We show that PI3Kgamma controls thymocyte survival and activation of mature T cells but has no role in the development or function of B cells. PI3Kgamma-deficient neutrophils exhibited severe defects in migration and respiratory burst in response to heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and chemotactic agents. PI3Kgamma links GPCR stimulation to the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and the activation of protein kinase B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Thus, PI3Kgamma regulates thymocyte development, T cell activation, neutrophil migration, and the oxidative burst."

As a probe of intracellular signals responsible for this asymmetry, the pleckstrin homology domain of the AKT protein kinase (or protein kinase B), tagged with the green fluorescent protein (PHAKT-GFP), was expressed in neutrophils. Upon exposure of cells to chemoattractant, PHAKT-GFP is recruited selectively to membrane at the cell's leading edge, indicating an internal signaling gradient that is much steeper than that of the chemoattractant. Translocation of PHAKT-GFP is inhibited by toxin-B from Clostridium difficile, indicating that it requires activity of one or more Rho guanosine triphosphatases."

PI3Kgamma was required for chemoattractant-induced production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns (3,4,5)P3] and has an important role in chemoattractant-induced superoxide production and chemotaxis in mouse neutrophils and in production of T cell-independent antigen-specific antibodies composed of the immunoglobulin lambda light chain (TI-IglambdaL). The study of the mice lacking PLC-beta2 and -beta3 revealed that the PLC pathways have an important role in chemoattractant-mediated production of superoxide and regulation of protein kinases, but not chemotaxis. The PLC pathways also appear to inhibit the chemotactic activity induced by certain chemoattractants and to suppress TI-IglambdaL production."

Surface expression of HLA-E depends on binding of conserved peptides derived from MHC class I molecules. The same peptide is present in the leader sequence of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoprotein UL40 (gpUL40). It is shown that, independently of the transporter associated with antigen processing, gpUL40 can up-regulate expression of HLA-E, which protects targets from NK cell lysis.

The transition rate exhibited a resonance line shape with an extremely narrow width as small as 1.5 kilohertz. The precise shape and position of the resonance are sensitive to the mean-field interactions between the molecules and the atomic condensate. As a result, we were able to measure the molecule-condensate interactions. This method allows molecular binding energies to be determined with unprecedented accuracy and is of interest as a mechanism for the generation of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate."

https://openalex.org/W2130874431,"Adult skeletal muscle fibers can be categorized into fast and slow twitch subtypes based on specialized contractile and metabolic properties and on distinctive patterns of muscle gene expression. Muscle fiber-type characteristics are dependent on the frequency of motor nerve stimulation and are thought to be controlled by calcium-dependent signaling. The calcium, calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, stimulates slow fiber-specific gene promoters in cultured skeletal muscle cells, and the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A, inhibits slow fiber gene expression in vivo, suggesting a key role of calcineurin in activation of the slow muscle fiber phenotype. Calcineurin has also been shown to induce hypertrophy of cardiac muscle and to mediate the hypertrophic effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 on skeletal myocytes in vitro.

Certain fast fibers exhibit a glycolytic metabolism, whereas slow twitch fibers are predominantly oxidative. These properties reflect the expression of specific sets of fast and slow contractile protein isoforms of myosin heavy and light chains, tropomyosin, and troponins, as well as myoglobin. The fiber-type characteristics of adult skeletal muscle are regulated, at least in part, by the frequency of motor nerve stimulation and resulting changes in intracellular calcium levels (3.Pette D. Vrbova G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 120: 115-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Williams R.S. Salmons S. Newsholme E.A. Kaufman R.E. Mellor J. J. Biol.

Tonic low frequency stimulation, either from the motor neuron or by direct electrical stimulation of muscle fibers, induces the slow fiber phenotype, whereas denervation or lack of electrical stimulation evokes a slow-to-fast fiber conversion (reviewed in Ref. 6.Hughes S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R892-R894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that slow fibers maintain higher levels of intracellular calcium (7.Chin E.R. Allen D.G. Physiologist. 1996; 39: A-75Google Scholar, 8.Westerblad H. Allen D.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), but the signaling systems responsible for activation of the slow fiber gene program remain poorly understood. Calcineurin is a calcium-, calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase activated by changes in intracellular calcium (reviewed in Ref. 9.Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The properties of calcineurin have been studied most extensively in T cells, whereupon activation in response to T cell receptor signaling, calcineurin dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)1proteins, which translocate to the nucleus and act combinatorially with other transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 10.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT is driven selectively by sustained, low amplitude elevations in intracellular calcium concentrations, while brief calcium transients, even of high amplitude, are insufficient for this purpose (11.Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Activation of calcineurin-dependent genes in T cells requires costimulation of mitogen-activated and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase signaling pathways (10.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), which activate the AP-1 and MEF2 transcription factors. Recent studies have also shown that activated calcineurin stimulates transcriptional activity of MEF2 transcription factors (12.Liu S. Liu P. Borras A. Chatila T. Speck S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), expressed in T cells and muscle (reviewed in Ref. 13.Black B. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), through mechanisms that remain to be defined. Several properties of calcineurin signaling suggest that it may participate in the control of slow skeletal muscle gene expression. First, its selective activation by prolonged elevation of calcium and insensitivity to high amplitude calcium spikes correspond to the type of signaling thought to activate slow fiber-specific genes (9.Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Second, the control regions of several slow fiber-specific genes contain adjacent binding sites for NFAT and MEF2 factors (14.Nakayama M. Strauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6641-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Third, transplant patients maintained on the calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK-506, develop skeletal myopathy and a loss of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, suggesting an important role for calcineurin in regulating muscle function (18.Goy J.-J. Stauffer J.-C. Deruaz J.-P. Gillard D. Kaufmann U. Kuntzer T. Kappenberger L. Lancet. 1989; I: 1446-1447Abstract Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that calcineurin up-regulates slow muscle fiber genes in cultured C2C12 muscle cells (15.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the myoglobin and slow troponin I (TnI) genes by calcineurin was dependent on adjacent binding sites for NFAT and MEF2. Moreover, treatment of rats with CsA or FK-506 resulted in partial conversion of slow to fast fibers, suggesting that calcineurin activity was required for slow fiber gene expression. However, since systemic administration of CsA can also inhibit calcineurin activity in neurons, potentially altering motor innervation, and also has nonspecific effects, it was unclear whether the decrease in slow fiber gene expression in response to CsA reflected an essential role of calcineurin in skeletal muscle per se. Calcineurin has also been implicated in hypertrophy of cardiac and skeletal muscle (19.Molkentin J.D. Lu J. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 20.Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yoeh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P. Graham R.M.

Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In primary cardiomyocytes, calcineurin activation is required for hypertrophic growth in response to a variety of agonists (19.Molkentin J.D. Lu J. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of activated calcineurin in the hearts of transgenic mice results in dramatic myocardial growth that can be partially mimicked by a mutant form of NFAT3 lacking the phosphorylation sites normally dephosphorylated by calcineurin (19.Molkentin J.D. Lu J. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Activated calcineurin has also been shown to induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle cells in culture, and inhibition of calcineurin activity can block the hypertrophic response to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 (20.Semsarian C. Wu M.J. Ju Y.K. Marciniec T. Yoeh T. Allen D.G. Harvey R.P. Graham R.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 21.Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). CsA has also been reported to inhibit both hypertrophy and fast-to-slow fiber transformations induced in muscles of intact animals by mechanical load (22.Dunn S.E. Bums J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). While the latter studies suggest an important role for calcineurin in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, they do not indicate whether calcineurin activation alone is sufficient to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivoor, alternatively, whether other signals are also required to activate calcineurin-dependent genes, as is the case in T cells. To further investigate the role of calcineurin in the control of skeletal muscle fiber type and hypertrophy, we generated transgenic mice in which activated calcineurin was expressed in skeletal muscle under control of the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer. These mice show a dramatic increase in slow skeletal muscle fibers, but no evidence for skeletal muscle hypertrophy. We conclude that activated calcineurin is sufficient to activate the slow fiber gene regulatory program in vivo and that additional signals are required for skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The 4800-base pair upstream region of the mouse MCK gene was released from the pCK4800CAT construct (23.Sternberg E.A. Spizz G. Perry W.M. Vizard D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 8: 2896-2909Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) by HindIII digestion and ligated to the HindIII site of pBluescript (Stratagene). The activated form of calcineurin (24.O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) was ligated into theEcoRI site followed by the human growth hormone (hGH) polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal. This transgene is referred to as MCK-CN*. Transgenic mice were created by injection of the MCK-CN* construct into the male pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes obtained from the B6C3F1 strain. The MCK-CN* cassette was released from the vector backbone by digestion with eitherXhoI and SacII or BssHII, gel-purified, and eluted using Qiaquick columns (Qiagen). Stable founder lines were identified initially by Southern analysis and subsequently by PCR using primers specific for the hGH poly(A) signal sequences. Expression of the transgene was assessed by Northern analysis using a calcineurin cDNA as a probe. Hindlimb muscle (soleus, gastrocnemius, and plantaris), isolated from 2- to 3-month-old nontransgenic and transgenic littermates was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections were stained histochemically for myosin ATPase activity at pH 4.54 as described previously (25.Brooke M.H. Kaiser K.K. Arch. Neurol. 1970; 23: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from tissues of 2-month-old nontransgenic and transgenic littermates using the TRIzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed using standard techniques. RT-PCR analysis of fiber-specific transcripts was performed as described (26.Rawls A. Valdez M.R. Zhang W. Richardson J. Klein W.H. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from 2-month-old nontransgenic and transgenic hindlimb muscle (minus soleus) was used as a template for reverse transcriptase. cDNAs were subsequently subjected to PCR, fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant Program (Molecular Dynamics). RT-PCR reactions were performed under conditions of linearity with respect to input RNA and the number of amplification cycles. PCR reactions were determined to be linear for 18–24 cycles. Primers for detecting fiber-specific transcripts were as follows: myoglobin (sense, 5′-GCACAAGATCCCGGTCAAGTACCTGGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGACGAAGGCCACTTTGCACCTCTG-3′), TnI slow (sense, 5′-TGCCGGAAGTTGAGAGGAAATCCAAGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGCACCTTCAGCTTCAGGTCCTTGAT-3′), sMtCK (sense, 5′-GATGGCCAGTGCCTTCTCAAAGTTGCTA-3′; antisense, 5′-TGTCCACTCCAGTTTGGATGCACTGGTC-3′); parvalbumin (sense, 5′-GCAGGATGTCGATGACAGACGTGCTCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCACTTACGTTTCAGCCACCAGAGTGGA-3′), MCK (sense, 5′-GATGTCATCCAGACTGGGGTGGACAACC-3′; antisense, 5′-TGAACTCGCCCGTCAGGCTGTTGAG-3′). To determine whether activated calcineurin was sufficient to modify the properties of skeletal muscle in vivo, we created transgenic mice harboring an expression cassette in which the 4800-bp region upstream of the mouse MCK gene was linked to a cDNA encoding an activated form of calcineurin. This constitutively active variant of calcineurin lacks the carboxyl-terminal autoinhibitory domain that binds calcium/calmodulin (24.O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Four independent lines of MCK-calcineurin (MCK-CN*) transgenic mice were obtained. Expression of the transgene was confirmed by Northern analysis using a probe specific for the truncated calcineurin transcript. MCK is normally expressed preferentially in fast skeletal muscle fibers, with detectable but reduced expression in heart and slow skeletal muscle (27.Johnson J.E. Wold B.J. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Consistent with the muscle-specific expression of the MCK upstream region, transgene expression was restricted to skeletal and cardiac muscle (Fig. 1). Expression in the heart was only detected upon longer exposure. Calcineurin expression from the transgene was at least 10-fold higher than the level of expression of the endogenous gene in skeletal muscle and about 2-fold higher than the level of expression in brain (Fig.1 B). Previously, we showed that expression of activated calcineurin in the heart, under control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter, resulted in severe cardiac hypertrophy, with a 2–3-fold increase in cardiac mass by 4 weeks of age (19.Molkentin J.D. Lu J. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). MCK-CN* transgenic mice showed only mild cardiac hypertrophy, reflecting the weak postnatal expression of the MCK upstream region in the heart. Based on visual inspection and histological sections of skeletal muscle, we found no evidence for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in MCK-CN* transgenic mice. We also determined myofiber cross-sectional areas and weight of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles from wild-type and MCK-CN* transgenic mice, but found no statistically significant differences. The only obvious difference in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice was the deep red appearance of fast fibers, such as the gastrocnemius, which normally appears more pale. This suggested that fast muscles from the transgenics expressed a higher amount of myoglobin, characteristic of slow fibers. To investigate possible changes in fiber type in MCK-CN* transgenic mice, transverse sections of hindlimb muscle were assayed for myosin ATPase activity using a pH-sensitive histochemical stain that distinguishes between slow and fast muscle fibers. As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was a visible increase in dark stained fibers in MCK-CN* transgenic mice, demonstrating a transformation to the slow fiber phenotype. To further confirm the qualitative changes observed, we quantitated numbers of slow fibers in hindlimbs by counting dark stained fibers in gastrocnemius tissue sections. In nontransgenic mice, there was an average number of 60.4 ± 11.2 (n = 5) slow fibers in the gastrocnemius, whereas in MCK-CN* transgenics, there was an average of 128.4 ± 28.6 (n = 5) gastrocnemius fibers that stained positively for slow myosin. This represents a 2.1-fold (p < 0.05) increase in the number of slow fibers. The increase in slow fibers was similar in the different transgenic lines. We also examined expression of transcripts for several slow and fast fiber-restricted genes in MCK-CN* transgenic mice. Myoglobin, TnI slow, and sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK), which are normally expressed primarily in slow fibers, showed a 2.5 ± 0.6 (n = 3), 3.1 ± 0.7 (n = 3), and 1.8 ± 0.2 (n = 3)-fold increase in expression, respectively, in gastrocnemius of the transgenics (Fig. 3). Conversely, transcripts for parvalbumin and MCK, which are expressed predominantly in fast fibers, were expressed at 0.51 ± 0.06 (n= 3) and 0.65 ± 0.06 (n = 3) of wild-type levels, respectively, in gastrocnemius of transgenics. Together, the above results demonstrated that expression of activated calcineurin in skeletal muscle is sufficient to induce a fast to slow fiber transformation. The results of this study lead to two important conclusions concerning calcineurin signaling in skeletal muscle. First, they demonstrate that activated calcineurin is sufficient to induce slow fiber gene expression in vivo. Second, they show that calcineurin activation alone is insufficient to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo. The fast and slow muscle fiber phenotypes are thought to be dependent on differences in intracellular calcium resulting from motor innervation (reviewed in Ref. 6.Hughes S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R892-R894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Slow fibers maintain higher intracellular calcium concentrations, evoked by sustained, tonic motor nerve stimulation, whereas fast fibers are characterized by intermittent stimulation and higher amplitude fluctuations in calcium levels (6.Hughes S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R892-R894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that activated calcineurin partially mimics the effects of tonic motor nerve stimulation on skeletal muscle, resulting in an increase in slow skeletal muscle fibers. However, this fast to slow fiber transformation in response to activated calcineurin is incomplete, in that not all fast fibers undergo this transition. Similarly, systemic administration of CsA to rats causes only a partial loss of slow fibers in vivo (15.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that there is heterogeneity among fibers with respect to their sensitivity to calcineurin signaling and suggest that other calcium-dependent signaling systems may also be required for determining slow and fast fiber gene expression. In this regard, we have recently found that activated calcium, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) can up-regulate slow fiber genes and can synergize with calcineurin to stimulate transcriptional activity of the transcription factor MEF2, which binds several slow fiber gene regulatory regions. 2H. Wu, F. J. Naya, T. McKinsey, B. Mercer, R. Bassel-Duby, E. N. Olson, and R. S. Williams, unpublished results. The existence of calcineurin-independent signaling systems for slow fiber gene expression is also suggested by recent studies demonstrating that slow fiber gene expression can be conferred by transcription factors other than those known to be targets for calcineurin (16.Esser K.

We propose that activated calcineurin may be necessary, but not sufficient, to induce hypertrophic growth of skeletal muscle. Perhaps calcineurin is only one of multiple downstream signaling pathways activated by IGFs and, under the conditions of cell culture systems, activated calcineurin can induce hypertrophy because the other essential pathways are already activated. Paradoxically, IGF-1 has been shown to induce an increase in glycolytic enzymes, as well as hypertrophy, in cultured skeletal muscle cells (21.Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olson E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Similarly, fast fibers are preferentially hypertrophied in response to certain forms of exercise. This suggests that the regulatory programs that control hypertrophy and slow fiber gene expression can be uncoupled and that although calcineurin is required for hypertrophic growth in response to IGF-1, additional signaling pathways are also required for slow fiber gene expression. An important goal for the future will be to identify the signaling pathways that cooperate with calcineurin and to determine how these signaling systems are integrated to establish the transcriptional programs that govern hypertrophy and fiber type."

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. PPARγ mRNA expression was found in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes, raising the possibility of PPARγ involvement in the regulation of T cell function. Here we show that PPARγ ligands, troglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 prostaglandin J2, but not PPARα agonist Wy14643, inhibited IL-2 production and phytohemagglutinin-inducible proliferation in human peripheral blood T-cells in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect on IL-2 was restricted to the PPARγ2-expressing, not the PPARγ-lacking, subpopulation of transfected Jurkat cells. The activated PPARγ physically associates with transcriptional factor NFAT regulating the IL-2 promoter, blocking NFAT DNA binding and transcriptional activity. This interaction with T-cell-specific transcription factors indicates an important immunomodulatory role for PPARγ in T lymphocytes and could suggest a previously unrecognized clinical potential for PPARγ ligands as immunotherapeutic drugs to treat T-cell-mediated diseases by targeting IL-2 gene expression.

However, in higher organisms, the widespread tissue distribution of PPARγ (6.Spiegelman B.M.

It is well known that the activation of T lymphocytes is much different from monocytes because it proceeds by the initial activation of transcription factors that ultimately fulfill the biological amplification of the immune response. Although PPARγ mRNA is expressed in human peripheral blood T lymphocytes (9.Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar), nothing is known about the physiologic regulation of PPARγ in T-cell activation. Here we demonstrate that the activated PPARγ physically associates with the T-cell specific transcriptional factor NFAT and blocks NFAT DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Ultimately, the transcription and production of the vital T-cell cytokine IL-2 is blocked.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether PPARγ interferes with T lymphocyte activation, we investigated the effect of the PPARγ ligands on PHA-mediated T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production. Human peripheral blood T cells were stimulated by PHA and cultured with various concentrations of different ligands for 72 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, the specific PPARγ agonist of the thiazolidinedione family, troglitazone (13.Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), completely abolished PHA-inducible [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects were observed in the presence of 15d-PGJ2 (14.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar), which is a natural PPARγ ligand. By contrast, the PPARα-specific ligand Wy14643 did not inhibit PHA-mediated T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, PHA/PMA-induced IL-2 synthesis assayed by ELISA was also restricted by the co-addition of troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B).Because the induction of IL-2 gene expression is a pivotal event in early T lymphocyte activation, we next performed RNase protection assays of human peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PHA/PMA in the presence or absence of troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Total RNA was isolated and probed for IL-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig.1 C, IL-2 mRNA steady-state levels were detected as early as 6 h and strongly increased after 12 h of PHA/PMA stimulation. Treatment with troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2totally abrogated expression of IL-2 mRNA. The quantification of decreased IL-2 mRNA levels was performed by normalizing densitometric traces against L32 mRNA. The IL-2 transcript was reduced by greater than 90% as compared with controls, suggesting that PPARγ ligands blocked transcription of the IL-2 gene.Because transfection efficiency of circulating human T cells is very poor, we chose to use the human T cell line Jurkat that expresses little detectable PPARγ mRNA (9.Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar) as a model system to directly assess the actual role of PPARγ expression in the PPARγ ligand-induced inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte activation. The Jurkat cells were transfected with PPARγ2 wild type expression vector (pSG5hPPARγ2) (15.Elbrecht A. Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M. Moller D.E. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) or control pSG5 plasmid. For this study, we used GFP as a cotransfected biomarker to simplify the selection of transfected target cells (13.Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) by FACS sorting and assay for IL-2 production. As shown in Fig.2 A, PPARγ ligands troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-2 production only in the PPARγ2-expressing, but not in PPARγ2-nonexpressing, subpopulation of transfected Jurkat cells. Interestingly, Wy14643 did not also show this inhibitory effect. Thus, from the data presented, it is clear that such inhibitory effects on T-cell activation are mediated by PPARγ.Figure 2Troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 inhibit transcription and production of IL-2 in transfected Jurkat T cells in a PPAR γ-dependent manner. A, Jurkat cells were transfected with either control vector (pSG5) or PPARγ2 wild type expression vector (pSG5hPPARγ2) and co-transfected with pEGFPC1 plasmid. Transfected target cells were sorted by FACS and then assayed for IL-2 production. B,upper panel, Jurkat cells were co-transfected with a PPARγ-expression plasmid (+PPARγ2) or control DNA (−PPARγ2) and a PPRE reporter gene (AOx-TK). Cells were treated with 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone for an additional 24 h. The luciferase activity was determined.Lower panel, Jurkat cells were co-transfected with an IL-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid and a PPARγ expression plasmid (+PPARγ) or control DNA (−PPARγ).

Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar) into Jurkat T cells. Fig.2 B (upper panel) shows that activation of a PPAR-dependent promoter required co-expression of PPARγ in Jurkat T cells. Upon addition of the PPARγ ligand troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2, luciferase activity was significantly increased corresponding to overexpression of PPARγ. To determine whether changes in IL-2 mRNA levels can be ascribed, at least in part, to differences in promoter activity, Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with IL-2 luciferase reporter constructs and a PPARγ expression plasmid. PMA/PHA treatment resulted in a marked increase in IL-2 promoter activity. Lack of PPARγ expression rendered the Jurkat cells unresponsive to the inhibitory effects of troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 on PHA/PMA-induced IL-2 promoter activation (Fig.2 B, lower panel). However, this effect was restored by transfection of PPARγ. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 on IL-2 promoter activity are directly dependent on the expression and activation of PPARγ.The transcription factor NFAT plays an essential role in IL-2 gene expression. NF-ATc1 is also involved in the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes (16.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated transcriptional activity and DNA binding of NFAT to determine whether NFAT might be a target for negative regulation of T-cell activation by PPARγ ligands. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the specific binding of NFAT probe corresponding to the human IL-2 promoter is strongly induced by PHA/PMA, whereas equivalent nuclear extracts from troglitazone- or 15d-PGJ2-treated cells displayed diminished binding capacity to the 32P-radiolabeled probes. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of PPARγ ligands on NF-κB and AP-1 DNA-binding activities was also observed in T cells activated by PHA/PMA (data not shown). In contrast, the DNA binding of Sp-1 (17.Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was unaffected by troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 (Fig.3 B). The EMSA data obtained correlated with the effect of PPARγ ligands on the transcriptional activity analyzed by a reporter construct directed by the NFAT distal site of the IL-2 promoter. The transcriptional activation of the above reporter construct was abrogated by troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in the presence of PPARγ overexpression (Fig. 3 C). Thus, one conceivable explanation for the repression of IL-2 transcription in troglitazone- or 15d-PGJ2-treated cells could be due to selective disruption of the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter.Figure 3Troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 inhibit DNA binding and transcriptional activation of NFAT. Aand B, DNA binding of tran- scription factors NFAT (A) and Sp-1 (B) induced by PHA/PMA in human peripheral blood T cells as demonstrated by EMSA. Cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide-control or troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 and incubated with medium (−) or PHA/PMA (+) for 2 h at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with a 32P-labeled probe. Arrowindicates migrational location of each DNA complex. Excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild type (wt) or mutated (mt) NFAT sites were used as competitors to test for specificity of DNA complex. Antibodies against NFAT supershifted the protein-DNA complex. C, Jurkat cells were co-transfected with a reporter construct directed by the NFAT distal site of the IL-2 promoter and either a PPARγ-wild type (+PPARγ) or control DNA plasmid (−PPARγ). Cells were treated with different ligands, stimulated by PHA/PMA as shown, and collected for analysis of reporter gene activity 24 h later.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we focused our attention on how functional co-association of PPARγ with transcription factors NFAT might mediate T-cell suppression. We tested for complex formation between PPARγ and NFAT in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Fresh human peripheral blood T cells were induced by PMA/PHA and treated with troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a PPARγ-specific antibody; immunoprecipitates were developed on Western blots with an NFATc1-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, The NFATc1 complex can be co-precipitated with PPARγ in cells induced by PMA/PHA and troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Furthermore, the addition of anti-PPARγ antibody induced high affinity binding of extracts to the NFAT probes as determined by EMSA (data not shown), demonstrating that removal of PPARγ with this antiserum increases the target specificity of NFAT. These data indicate that a direct physical protein-protein interaction occurs between nuclear receptor PPARγ and transcription factors NFAT.Figure 4PPAR γ associates with NFAT in T cells. PPARγ-NFAT complexes were detected after immunoprecipitation and protein immunoblot analysis of T cells. Cells lysates from T cells induced by PHA/PMA or ligands were prepared. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-PPARγ antibodies. Immune complexes were washed and analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-NFATc1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms by which steroid nuclear receptors regulate cytokine genes (18.Gottlicher M. Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Corticosteroids may bind directly as a dimer to regulatory sequences (GRE) in target gene promoters and subsequently affect activation of transcription. Dexamethasone has also been shown to inhibit the IL-2 promoter by interference with AP-1. The current model of dexamethasone inhibition has demonstrated a physical interaction between corticosteroid receptor and NF-κB. In the case of PPARγ, a non-steroid nuclear receptor, it has been reported that PPARγ agonists specifically inhibit expression of tumor necrosis factor α through inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α promoter activity in monocytes (9.Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar). However, no physical co-precipitation of PPARγ with other transcription factors was shown. The data presented here demonstrate that PPARγ ligands suppress transactivation of IL-2 via down-regulation of the IL-2 promoter in a PPARγ-dependent manner. The transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene has been analyzed extensively at the level of the IL-2 promoter. cis-Acting elements for several transcription factors have been identified within this regulatory region. The factors that bind to these motifs include NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB proteins. Also, a binding site for Sp-1 has been identified immediately upstream of the distal NFAT site. Our data show that PPARγ ligands selectively block DNA binding and transcriptional activation of transcription factors such as NFAT regulating the IL-2 promoter in T cells.From our data, PPARγ down-regulates the IL-2 promoter by a novel mechanism that involves protein-protein interactions. As shown in Fig.4, formation of a molecular complex between PPARγ and NFAT may occur in T cells, which could block PHA/PMA-induced DNA binding and transactivation. Although we have focused on the interaction between NFAT and PPARγ, we cannot exclude the possibility that PPARγ interaction with AP-1 or NF-κB may also play an important role in blocking IL-2 gene transcription. However, activation and function of NFAT is an absolute requirement for IL-2 transcription.Taken together, these data provided the evidence that the inhibitory role of PPARγ in the immunomodulation of T lymphocytes is based on functional interaction between PPARγ and T-cell-specific transcription factors. Such a model could highlight the importance of transcriptional cross-talk in T-cell biology and may lead to a new molecular class of immunomodulators. PPARγ ligands may be of therapeutic value in human T-cell-mediated diseases by targeting IL-2 gene expression. T-cell activation is a key step in the initiation of an immunological response. An activating stimulus initiates a complex signaling cascade, resulting in cell proliferation and secretion of cytokines that enhance the immune response (1.Crabtree G.R.

To determine whether changes in IL-2 mRNA levels can be ascribed, at least in part, to differences in promoter activity, Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with IL-2 luciferase reporter constructs and a PPARγ expression plasmid. PMA/PHA treatment resulted in a marked increase in IL-2 promoter activity. Lack of PPARγ expression rendered the Jurkat cells unresponsive to the inhibitory effects of troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 on PHA/PMA-induced IL-2 promoter activation (Fig.2 B, lower panel). However, this effect was restored by transfection of PPARγ. These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 on IL-2 promoter activity are directly dependent on the expression and activation of PPARγ.The transcription factor NFAT plays an essential role in IL-2 gene expression. NF-ATc1 is also involved in the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes (16.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated transcriptional activity and DNA binding of NFAT to determine whether NFAT might be a target for negative regulation of T-cell activation by PPARγ ligands. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the specific binding of NFAT probe corresponding to the human IL-2 promoter is strongly induced by PHA/PMA, whereas equivalent nuclear extracts from troglitazone- or 15d-PGJ2-treated cells displayed diminished binding capacity to the 32P-radiolabeled probes. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of PPARγ ligands on NF-κB and AP-1 DNA-binding activities was also observed in T cells activated by PHA/PMA (data not shown). In contrast, the DNA binding of Sp-1 (17.Skerka C. Decker E.L. Zipfel P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was unaffected by troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 (Fig.3 B). The EMSA data obtained correlated with the effect of PPARγ ligands on the transcriptional activity analyzed by a reporter construct directed by the NFAT distal site of the IL-2 promoter. The transcriptional activation of the above reporter construct was abrogated by troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in the presence of PPARγ overexpression (Fig. 3 C). Thus, one conceivable explanation for the repression of IL-2 transcription in troglitazone- or 15d-PGJ2-treated cells could be due to selective disruption of the transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 promoter.Figure 3Troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 inhibit DNA binding and transcriptional activation of NFAT.

Cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide-control or troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 and incubated with medium (−) or PHA/PMA (+) for 2 h at 37 °C. Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated with a 32P-labeled probe. Arrowindicates migrational location of each DNA complex. Excess amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing wild type (wt) or mutated (mt) NFAT sites were used as competitors to test for specificity of DNA complex.

Cells were treated with different ligands, stimulated by PHA/PMA as shown, and collected for analysis of reporter gene activity 24 h later.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we focused our attention on how functional co-association of PPARγ with transcription factors NFAT might mediate T-cell suppression. We tested for complex formation between PPARγ and NFAT in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Fresh human peripheral blood T cells were induced by PMA/PHA and treated with troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with a PPARγ-specific antibody; immunoprecipitates were developed on Western blots with an NFATc1-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, The NFATc1 complex can be co-precipitated with PPARγ in cells induced by PMA/PHA and troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Furthermore, the addition of anti-PPARγ antibody induced high affinity binding of extracts to the NFAT probes as determined by EMSA (data not shown), demonstrating that removal of PPARγ with this antiserum increases the target specificity of NFAT. These data indicate that a direct physical protein-protein interaction occurs between nuclear receptor PPARγ and transcription factors NFAT.Figure 4PPAR γ associates with NFAT in T cells. PPARγ-NFAT complexes were detected after immunoprecipitation and protein immunoblot analysis of T cells. Cells lysates from T cells induced by PHA/PMA or ligands were prepared. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using anti-PPARγ antibodies.

Heck S. Herrlich P. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Corticosteroids may bind directly as a dimer to regulatory sequences (GRE) in target gene promoters and subsequently affect activation of transcription. Dexamethasone has also been shown to inhibit the IL-2 promoter by interference with AP-1. The current model of dexamethasone inhibition has demonstrated a physical interaction between corticosteroid receptor and NF-κB. In the case of PPARγ, a non-steroid nuclear receptor, it has been reported that PPARγ agonists specifically inhibit expression of tumor necrosis factor α through inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α promoter activity in monocytes (9.Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar). However, no physical co-precipitation of PPARγ with other transcription factors was shown. The data presented here demonstrate that PPARγ ligands suppress transactivation of IL-2 via down-regulation of the IL-2 promoter in a PPARγ-dependent manner. The transcriptional regulation of the IL-2 gene has been analyzed extensively at the level of the IL-2 promoter. cis-Acting elements for several transcription factors have been identified within this regulatory region. The factors that bind to these motifs include NFAT, AP-1, and NF-κB proteins. Also, a binding site for Sp-1 has been identified immediately upstream of the distal NFAT site. Our data show that PPARγ ligands selectively block DNA binding and transcriptional activation of transcription factors such as NFAT regulating the IL-2 promoter in T cells.From our data, PPARγ down-regulates the IL-2 promoter by a novel mechanism that involves protein-protein interactions. As shown in Fig.4, formation of a molecular complex between PPARγ and NFAT may occur in T cells, which could block PHA/PMA-induced DNA binding and transactivation. Although we have focused on the interaction between NFAT and PPARγ, we cannot exclude the possibility that PPARγ interaction with AP-1 or NF-κB may also play an important role in blocking IL-2 gene transcription. However, activation and function of NFAT is an absolute requirement for IL-2 transcription.Taken together, these data provided the evidence that the inhibitory role of PPARγ in the immunomodulation of T lymphocytes is based on functional interaction between PPARγ and T-cell-specific transcription factors. Such a model could highlight the importance of transcriptional cross-talk in T-cell biology and may lead to a new molecular class of immunomodulators. PPARγ ligands may be of therapeutic value in human T-cell-mediated diseases by targeting IL-2 gene expression. To determine whether PPARγ interferes with T lymphocyte activation, we investigated the effect of the PPARγ ligands on PHA-mediated T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production. Human peripheral blood T cells were stimulated by PHA and cultured with various concentrations of different ligands for 72 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, the specific PPARγ agonist of the thiazolidinedione family, troglitazone (13.Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), completely abolished PHA-inducible [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner. Similar effects were observed in the presence of 15d-PGJ2 (14.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar), which is a natural PPARγ ligand. By contrast, the PPARα-specific ligand Wy14643 did not inhibit PHA-mediated T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, PHA/PMA-induced IL-2 synthesis assayed by ELISA was also restricted by the co-addition of troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Because the induction of IL-2 gene expression is a pivotal event in early T lymphocyte activation, we next performed RNase protection assays of human peripheral blood T cells stimulated with PHA/PMA in the presence or absence of troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2. Total RNA was isolated and probed for IL-2 mRNA. As shown in Fig.1 C, IL-2 mRNA steady-state levels were detected as early as 6 h and strongly increased after 12 h of PHA/PMA stimulation. Treatment with troglitazone or 15d-PGJ2totally abrogated expression of IL-2 mRNA. The quantification of decreased IL-2 mRNA levels was performed by normalizing densitometric traces against L32 mRNA. The IL-2 transcript was reduced by greater than 90% as compared with controls, suggesting that PPARγ ligands blocked transcription of the IL-2 gene. Because transfection efficiency of circulating human T cells is very poor, we chose to use the human T cell line Jurkat that expresses little detectable PPARγ mRNA (9.Greene M.E. Blumberg B. McBride O.W. Yi H.F. Kronquist K. Kwan K. Hsieh L. Greene G. Nimer S.D. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 281-299PubMed Google Scholar) as a model system to directly assess the actual role of PPARγ expression in the PPARγ ligand-induced inhibitory effects on T lymphocyte activation. The Jurkat cells were transfected with PPARγ2 wild type expression vector (pSG5hPPARγ2) (15.Elbrecht A. Elbrecht A. Chen Y. Cullinan C.A. Hayes N. Leibowitz M. Moller D.E. Berger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) or control pSG5 plasmid. For this study, we used GFP as a cotransfected biomarker to simplify the selection of transfected target cells (13.Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) by FACS sorting and assay for IL-2 production. As shown in Fig.2 A, PPARγ ligands troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-2 production only in the PPARγ2-expressing, but not in PPARγ2-nonexpressing, subpopulation of transfected Jurkat cells. Interestingly, Wy14643 did not also show this inhibitory effect. Thus, from the data presented, it is clear that such inhibitory effects on T-cell activation are mediated by PPARγ. To verify that the human PPARγ2 cDNA is capable of activating gene transcription through a PPRE in human T cells, we introduced a PPARγ2 expression vector (pSG5hPPARγ2) together with a PPRE-driven luciferase reporter construct (AOx-TK) (14.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar) into Jurkat T cells.

A uniformly applied chemoattractant generated binding sites for pleckstrin homology (PH) domains on the inner surface of the membrane in a pattern similar to that of the Gbetagamma subunits. Loss of cell polarity resulted in uniform distribution of both the Gbetagamma subunits and the sensitivity of PH domain recruitment. These observations indicate that Gbetagamma subunits are not sufficiently localized to restrict signaling events to the leading edge but that their distribution may determine the relative chemotactic sensitivity of polarized cells."

Recent studies have shown a number of puzzling phenomena associated with vortex motion, including: low-frequency noise1,2,3,4,5 and slow voltage oscillations3,6; a history-dependent dynamic response7,8,9,10,11,12, and memory of the direction, amplitude duration and frequency of the previously applied current13,14; high vortex mobility for alternating current, but no apparent vortex motion for direct currents13,15,16; and strong suppression of an a.c. response by small d.c. bias13. Taken together, these phenomena are incompatible with current understanding of vortex dynamics. Here we report a generic mechanism that accounts for these observations. Our model, which is derived from investigations of the current distribution across single crystals of NbSe2, is based on a competition between the injection of a disordered vortex phase at the sample edges, and the dynamic annealing of this metastable disorder by the transport current. For an alternating current, only narrow regions near the edges are in the disordered phase, while for d.c. bias, most of the sample is in the disordered phase—preventing vortex motion because of more efficient pinning. The resulting spatial dependence of the disordered vortex system serves as an active memory of the previous history."

While the chaperone function of αA-crystallin markedly improves with an increase in temperature, the activity of αB homopolymer appears to change very little upon heating. Compared with αB-crystallin, the αA-homopolymer is markedly less active at low temperatures, but becomes a more active species at high temperatures.

The lenticular α-crystallin consists of two 20-kDa polypeptide chains, αA and αB, that share about 60% sequence homology. These chains self-associate, forming large oligomeric complexes that contain 30–50 subunits at the αA to αB ratio of approximately 3:1. Although the high resolution structure of α-crystallin is currently not known, recent cryoelectron microscopy data shows that the recombinant αB-crystallin assembles into spherical particles with a diameter of 8–18 nm and a central cavity (4.Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For many years it was believed that the expression of α-crystallin was restricted to the ocular lens. More recently, αB-crystallin has been shown to be expressed in a number of non-lenticular tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain (3.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chaperone function of α-crystallin is likely to be of considerable importancein vivo. In particular, the above function was suggested to be instrumental in the prevention of cataract formation in the ocular lens (9.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 14.Rao P.V. Huang Q.L. Horwitz J. Zigler J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1245: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In nonlenticular tissues, the role of small heat shock proteins may be to maintain substrate proteins in a folding-competent state (15.Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16.Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of the chaperone action of α-crystallin is at present not fully understood, it was shown that α-crystallin specifically recognizes aggregation-prone non-native structures that occur early on the denaturation pathway of proteins (17.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18.Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol.

Furthermore, a number of studies suggest that the chaperone activity of the protein is dependent on the presence of surface-exposed hydrophobic patches (11.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

The apparent difference in the tissue specificity of αA- and αB-crystallins strongly suggests that these two proteins might have evolved to play distinct physiological functions. Therefore, it is of considerable importance to understand how these differences correlate with the physicochemical properties of αA- and αB-crystallins. In the present study, we present a detailed comparison of the recombinant human αA- and αB-crystallins, with a special emphasis on the chaperone activity and the surface hydrophobicity of both proteins. Insulin, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, bovine α-lactalbumin (type III), lysozyme, DNase, protease inhibitor mixture, and DTT1 were purchased from Sigma. ANS and bis-ANS were obtained from Molecular Probes. Complementary DNA fragments encoding human αA- and αB-crystallin were cloned into the pET23d expression plasmid (Novagen). Cloning of human αA-crystallin cDNA was described previously (26.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Human αB-crystallin cDNA was obtained as an IMAGE clone (GenBank number N35834) from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis. MO). Coding regions in expression constructs were completely sequenced to verify their structures. For overexpression, plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21, and 1-liter cultures were grown as described previously (26.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation and proteins extracted by the DNase/lysozyme method as described by Andley et al. (26.Andley U.P. Mathur S. Griest T.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31973-31980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), with the exception that different DNase treatment conditions were used in the present study (1 h incubation at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml of the enzyme). The above conditions allowed us to completely remove nucleic acid contamination of α-crystallin preparations (see below). The extracted proteins were dialyzed against a large volume of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble lysate was applied onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The proteins were eluted using a linear 0–0.5 m gradient of NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions containing αA- or αB-crystallins were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified recombinant α-crystallins showed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel a single band corresponding to protein with a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient, ε280, of 16,500 and 19,000m−1 cm−1 for αA- and αB-crystallin, respectively (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The lack of nucleic acid contamination in the final protein preparations was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and absorption spectroscopy: theA 280/A 260 ratio for all samples was higher than 1.5 (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin samples for FTIR were prepared in deuterium oxide buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.2) at a protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml and placed between two calcium fluoride windows separated by a 50-μm thick spacer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker FTS 66 instrument equipped with a thermostated cell holder as described previously (28.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The spectra in the 1500–1800 cm−1 region were corrected for the weak absorption of the buffer and for the residual water vapor signal. The technique of Fourier self-deconvolution was used to resolve the overlapping infrared bands (28.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The secondary structure content was estimated by curve fitting of amide I band contours (28.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of ANS and bis-ANS in the presence of α-crystallin was measured on SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer using the excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 490 nm, respectively. All measurements were performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. To determine dye-α-crystallin binding constants, small aliquots of a concentrated bis-ANS solution (250 μm) were successively added to protein solution in buffer (0.1 mg/ml). After each addition of the dye the mixture was thoroughly mixed and left to incubate for 5 min (such an incubation period was found to be sufficient to establish equilibrium). Fluorescence intensity was then measured and the readings were corrected for buffer blanks and dilution. The calibration factor that relates the change in fluorescence intensity to the amount of bis-ANS bound to the protein was determined by a reverse titration method as described previously (29.Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To probe the temperature dependence of dye-protein binding, α-crystallin (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 25 μm bis-ANS for 10 min at each temperature, and the fluorescence of the dye was measured at 490 nm (20.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallin was probed by measuring the ability of these proteins to prevent the aggregation of substrate proteins denatured by reduction of disulfide bonds (insulin, α-lactalbumin) or heat (alcohol dehydrogenase, citrate synthase). The aggregation of proteins upon denaturation was monitored by measuring the apparent absorption at 360 nm as a function of time. The relative chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallin was calculated as a percentage of protection against aggregation using the formula: % protection = ((A o − A)/A o) × 100, where A o and A represent the apparent saturation absorption (usually after 1 h) in the absence and presence of α-crystallin, respectively (11.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregation assays with different target proteins were performed essentially as described by Horwitz et al. (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The conformation-sensitive amide I band contours of αA- and αB-crystallin at room temperature exhibit a maximum at 1632 cm−1, a feature characteristic of proteins rich in β-sheet structure (Fig.1 A). The spectra of both proteins also show a shoulder between approximately 1645 and 1660 cm−1. However, the relative intensity of the 1632 cm−1 maximum with respect to the above shoulder is significantly higher for αB- than for αA-crystallin, suggesting that the former protein is characterized by a higher proportion of β-sheet structure. This qualitative conclusion has been confirmed using Fourier self-deconvolution and band fitting analysis of the spectra (28.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 30.Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). The deconvolved spectra of both proteins are dominated by a β-sheet band at 1631 cm−1 (Fig.1 B). The weaker bands at 1645, 1656, and 1663 cm−1 are usually assigned to unordered structure, α-helices and turns, respectively, whereas the components at 1672/1673 and 1682/1684 cm−1 may contain contributions from both β-sheets and turns (28.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 30.Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar, 31.Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Chapman D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 32.Surewicz W.K. Olesen P.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9655-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Quantitative band fitting analysis shows that the fractional area of the β-sheet band at 1631 cm−1 amounts to 43% for αA-crystallin and 48% for αB-crystallin. The respective values for the α-helical band at 1656 cm−1 are 18 and 12%. The conclusion that αB homopolymer contains a higher proportion of β-structure and lower content of α-helix is valid despite the ambiguity in the assignment of the 1672/1673 and 1682/1684 cm−1 bands since the fractional area of these weak components in the spectra of both proteins is very similar. Infrared spectroscopy was also used to probe the thermal stability of αA and αB homopolymers. Upon heating of αA-crystallin, the “native” β-sheet peak at 1632 cm−1 was gradually replaced by a broad band with a maximum at 1647–1649 cm−1(Fig. 2 A). Similar spectral changes were observed for αB-crystallin (spectra not shown). To further analyze the thermotropic changes in the secondary structure of α-crystallin homopolymers, the intensity ratio of the amide I band contour at 1632 cm−1 to that at 1649 cm−1 was plotted as a function of temperature (Fig. 2 B). The above plots indicate that both proteins undergo a relatively minor conformational change between approximately 40 and 55 °C, followed by a major transition in the backbone conformation with a midpoint around 62 °C. Bis-ANS is a hydrophobic molecule that becomes highly fluorescent upon binding to protein hydrophobic sites. This dye has been widely used for probing the surface hydrophobicity of proteins (20.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 25.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33.Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1535-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence titration curves for bis-ANS binding to αA- and αB-crystallins at 23 °C. At a saturating dye concentration, the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS associated with αB-crystallin is approximately 50% higher than that of the dye bound to αA-crystallin. A very similar difference between the saturation fluorescence intensity of the dye in the presence of αA and αB homopolymers was also seen when protein hydrophobicity was probed using a related monomeric dye, ANS (data not shown). The Scatchard analysis of the titration data for bis-ANS (Fig. 3, inset) yields the dissociation constants of 1.4 and 1.1 μm and a number of binding sites per protein monomer of 0.44 and 0.55 for αA- and αB-crystallin, respectively. The above dissociation constants are similar to those reported previously for the mixed chain α-crystallin from bovine lens (25.Sharma K.K. Kaur H. Kumar S. Kester K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8965-8970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Overall, this data indicates that at room temperature αB-crystallin is characterized by a higher surface hydrophobicity than αA-crystallin. However, the above difference is not preserved at elevated temperatures. As shown in Fig.4 A, the temperature dependence of the surface hydrophobicity for αA- and αB-crystallin is dramatically different. For αA-crystallin, the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS is relatively stable up to approximately 30 °C and increases rapidly upon further increase in temperature, reaching a maximum at approximately 48 °C. This phase is followed by a gradual decrease in bis-ANS fluorescence upon further heating of the protein. The increase in the emission intensity between approximately 30 and 48 °C indicates that in this temperature range αA-crystallin undergoes a conformational transition associated with the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites. No such conformational transition is detectable for αB-crystallin. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS in the presence of the latter protein shows a small gradual decrease upon heating in the entire temperature range between 20 and 60 °C. Overall, data of Fig. 4 A shows that the relative surface hydrophobicity of αA- and αB-crystallins is strongly temperature dependent: compared with αA homopolymer, αB-crystallin appears to be more hydrophobic at low temperatures, but becomes less hydrophobic at high temperatures. Importantly, at physiological temperatures the hydrophobicity properties of the two proteins are very similar.Figure 4A, temperature dependence of the fluorescence intensity at 490 nm of bis-ANS (25 μm) in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml αA- (closed circle) and αB-crystallin (open circle). B, fluorescence emission intensity at 23 °C of bis-ANS in the presence of αA- (closed circle) and αB-crystallin (open circle) as a function of the preincubation temperature. Samples of αA- or αB-crystallin (0.1 mg/ml) were preincubated at different temperatures for 15 min and cooled down to 23 °C. Bis-ANS (25 μm) was then added and fluorescence intensity measured at 490 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the thermotropic behavior of αA- and αB-crystallins, the proteins were preincubated for 15 min at temperatures between 22 and 60 °C. After cooling down to 23 °C, the samples were incubated for 3 h with bis-ANS and the fluorescence intensity of the dye was measured. As shown in Fig.4 B, when αA-crystallin was preincubated at temperatures above approximately 30 °C, upon cooling it was characterized by a markedly increased affinity for bis-ANS. This indicates that, once exposed to elevated temperatures, the protein does not return to its original conformational structure but adopts a new conformation that is characterized by an increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. No such “activation” of hydrophobic surfaces was observed for αB-crystallin. The chaperone activity of αA- and αB-crystallin was studied by monitoring the ability of these proteins to prevent the aggregation of substrate proteins denatured by a reducing agent or heat. The application of complementary assays allowed us to compare the chaperone activity of αA and αB homopolymers over the wide range of temperature. Reduction of the disulfide bond connecting the insulin A and B chains leads to the unfolding and aggregation of the B chain. The aggregation reaction can be suppressed by α-crystallin which binds the non-native conformer of the B-chain (12.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.-L. Ding L.-L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.-J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Fig.5 A shows the percentage protection at two different temperatures as a function of the concentration of αA- and αB-crystallin. From these plots, one can estimate the concentration of αA and αB homopolymers required to reduce the aggregation of insulin B-chain by 50%. The above parameter provides an empirical measure of a relative chaperone activity of both proteins. At 23 °C, the αB homopolymer is approximately 4.5 times more active than αA-crystallin. However, the two proteins respond differently to temperature changes: the chaperone activity of αA-crystallin markedly increases when the temperature is increased from 23 to 37 °C, whereas the activity of αB-crystallin remains essentially unchanged (Fig. 5 A). At 37 °C, αB-crystallin still appears to be more effective at suppressing insulin B chain aggregation. However, the ratio of the apparent potency of the αB and αA species is reduced from 4.5 at room temperature to approximately 2 at 37 °C. The insulin assay was also used to probe the relationship between the chaperone activity and structural reorganization of α-crystallin upon activation at high temperatures. As discussed above (see data of Fig. 4 B), upon exposure to elevated temperatures and subsequent cooling, αA-crystallin (but not αB-crystallin) adopts a conformation characterized by substantially increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. Fig. 5 B shows that high temperature preincubation also results in a markedly increased chaperone activity of the αA-homopolymer. This contrasts with αB-crystallin which shows no improvement of the chaperone function upon preincubation at elevated temperatures. Another protein suitable for studying the chaperone action of α-crystallin is bovine apolactalbumin. Reduction of disulfide bonds with DTT results in a rapid aggregation of this protein (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Both αA- and αB-crystallin suppress this nonspecific aggregation. At 23 °C, the αB homopolymer shows approximately three times higher activity than the αA species (Fig. 6). However, the ability of αA-crystallin to suppress the aggregation of α-lactalbumin markedly improves when the temperature is raised to 37 °C. This contrasts with the behavior of αB homopolymer, the activity of which is unaffected by the temperature. Importantly, at temperatures around 37 °C, the αA and αB homopolymers appear to have essentially the same ability to prevent the aggregation of α-apolactalbumin. Due to thermal instability of DTT, the chaperone assays described above could not be performed at temperatures exceeding 40 °C. However, the chaperone function of αA- and αB-crystallin at high temperatures could be studied by measuring the ability of these homopolymers to prevent the aggregation of thermally denatured proteins. The substrates suitable for such studies are alcohol dehydrogenase and citrate synthase (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 34.Muchowski P.I. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the relative potency of αA and αB homopolymers in suppressing the thermal aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase is strongly temperature dependent. At 40 °C αB-crystallin is about two times more potent than αA-crystallin. However, at 50 °C the two proteins become almost equally active and, upon further increase in temperature to 55 °C, the chaperone activity of αA-crystallin exceeds that of the αB homopolymer. A very similar temperature dependence of the relative chaperone activity of αA and αB homopolymers was observed using citrate synthase as a substrate protein (Fig.8).Figure 8The chaperone activity of αA- (closed circle) and αB-crystallin (open circle) as assessed by the suppression of the aggregation of heat-denatured citrate synthase at 40 °C (panel A), 50 °C (panel B), and 55 °C (panel C). The enzyme (0.05 mg/ml in 50 mmphosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) was incubated at a given temperature in the absence and presence of αA- or αB-crystallin, and the kinetics of enzyme aggregation was followed by monitoring the apparent absorption at 360 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the unresolved issues in α-crystallin research is the significance of the apparently different tissue specificity of the αA and αB chains. While the lens protein contains both αA and αB subunits (1.Hoenders H.J. Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley and Sons, New York1981: 279-326Google Scholar, 2.Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 10-21PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), non-lenticular distribution of α-crystallin is clearly dominated by the αB chain (3.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 5.Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 69: 153-201Google Scholar). Furthermore, elevated expression of the αB gene has been correlated with a number of neurological disorders (3.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 5.Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 69: 153-201Google Scholar). The above differences suggest that αA- and αB-crystallins may play distinct physiological functions. Based on very limited data, it was recently proposed that the broader tissue distribution of αB-crystallin may be rationalized by the greater hydrophobicity, and thus higher chaperone activity, of the αB-homopolymer as compared with αA-crystallin (35.Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The present results provide new insight into the relationship between the surface hydrophobicity and the chaperone function of αA- and αB-crystallins. One of the main findings of this study is that αA- and αB-crystallins fundamentally differ in the way they respond to temperature. The chaperone function of the αA homopolymer markedly improves with an increase in temperature, whereas the activity of αB-crystallin appears to change very little. As a result of this different response, the relative chaperone potency of αA- and αB-crystallins strongly depends on the temperature: αA homopolymer is markedly less active than αB at low temperatures, but becomes a more active species at high temperatures. Under physiologically relevant conditions (37–40 °C), the αB homopolymer is approximately two times more potent as a chaperone with respect to three out of four proteins tested, whereas with respect to one substrate the activity of both species is essentially identical. Based on the results of the “insulin assay,” it was recently concluded that αB-crystallin has a dramatically higher chaperone activity than αA homopolymer (35.Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A direct comparison of this data with our results is hampered by the lack of information about the temperature used in the previous study. Nevertheless, the present data shows that at physiological temperatures the difference in the chaperone activity of αA and αB-crystallins is very modest. To gain insight into the molecular basis of the temperature-dependent functional properties of αA- and αB-crystallins, we compared selected structural properties of these two proteins. Previous circular dichroism experiments provided conflicting data regarding the secondary structure of αA- and αB-crystallins. Sun et al. (35.Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) reported a higher content of β-sheet and lower proportion of α-helix for αA than αB-homopolymer, whereas data of Horwitz et al. (27.Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods. Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) indicates a similar secondary structure of both species. Here, we analyzed the secondary structure of both proteins using FTIR spectroscopy. Unlike circular dichroism, the FTIR method is not prone to potential artifacts due to light scattering and, thus, it is well suited for studying large oligomeric proteins such as α-crystallin. The FTIR results indicate that the secondary structure of both homopolymers is similar, with a slightly higher content of a β-sheet structure (and a lower proportion of α-helix) in αB-crystallin. The above small difference in the secondary structure is, however, unlikely to account for the temperature-dependent differences in the chaperone activities of αA- and αB-crystallins. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the thermotropic changes in the secondary structure of αA and αB homopolymers are essentially identical. Furthermore, the notion that the secondary structure is not a key determinant of the chaperone activity of α-crystallin is consistent with the observation that the chaperone function is preserved at temperatures as high as 55–65 °C, i.e. under the conditions leading to a major loss of the native secondary structure of α-crystallin. It is believed that binding of non-native proteins to α-crystallin is driven largely by hydrophobic interactions (11.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

(35.Sun T.-X. Das B.K. Liang J.J.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) recently reported that αB-crystallin is characterized by a much higher surface hydrophobicity than αA-crystallin, as indicated by a 3-fold stronger fluorescence intensity of the αB-bound ANS probe. However, our results do not concur with the previous study. While at room temperature αB indeed appears to be somewhat more hydrophobic than αA homopolymer, the hydrophobicity properties of the two proteins at physiologically relevant temperatures are essentially identical. The αA and αB homopolymers differ, however, with respect to the temperature dependence of their hydrophobicity profiles. Between approximately 30 and 48 °C, αA-crystallin appears to undergo a conformational transition resulting in the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites. Furthermore, once exposed to elevated temperature, upon cooling the protein adopts a new conformational state that is characterized by a markedly increased affinity for hydrophobic probes. No such effects occur for αB-crystallin. Its hydrophobicity properties appear to be remarkably resistant to temperature changes. The structural basis for the “thermal activation” of the surface hydrophobicity and chaperone activity of αA-crystallin is at present unknown. However, our preliminary spectroscopic experiments with various single tryptophan mutants of αA-homopolymer suggest that these effects may be related to an irreversible thermal transition within the C-terminal portion of the protein. 2G. B. Reddy, J. M. Petrash, and W. K. Surewicz, unpublished data. The assessment of the “intrinsic” chaperone activity of α-crystallin at different temperatures is complicated by a potential effect of temperature on the hydrophobicity of substrate proteins. However, under the present experimental conditions the latter effect appears to be not very significant since bis-ANS binding to two substrate proteins (non-reduced insulin and α-lactalbumin) was found essentially identical at 23 and 40 °C (data not shown). Furthermore, any potential temperature-dependent changes in surface hydrophobicity of target proteins would affect the interaction of these proteins with αA and αB homopolymers in the same way and, therefore, could not account for the observed differences in temperature-dependent chaperone function of αA and αB homopolymers. Given that, it is remarkable that the increase in the surface hydrophobicity of αA-crystallin invariably leads to an improved chaperone activity of this homopolymer. Furthermore, the temperature insensitivity of the chaperone function of αB homopolymer appears to correlate with the lack of thermal changes in the hydrophobicity of the latter protein. This apparent correlation provides strong support to the notion that the chaperone activity of α-crystallin is dependent on the presence of surface-exposed hydrophobic patches (11.Raman B. Rao C.M.

However, the present data also show that surface hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant of the chaperone activity of α-crystallin. For example, at physiologically relevant temperatures the two homopolymers are characterized by very similar hydrophobicity, whereas their ability to suppress the aggregation of some target proteins is significantly different. These findings provide a basis for future studies (e.g. using site-directed spectroscopic probes) on the structural correlates of the chaperone function of αA/αB-crystallin and related small heat shock proteins."

The facilitative effect of P on sexual receptivity in female rats was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides to DARPP-32. Homozygous mice carrying a null mutation for the DARPP-32 gene exhibited minimal levels of P-facilitated sexual receptivity when compared to their wild-type littermates. P significantly increased hypothalamic cAMP levels and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These increases were not inhibited by a D1 subclass dopamine receptor antagonist. P also enhanced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on threonine 34 in the hypothalamus of mice.

In the present study, we found that trypsin stimulates integrin-dependent adhesion and growth of MKN-1 human gastric carcinoma cells. MKN-1 cells expressed both proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and PAR-2, which are activated by thrombin and trypsin, respectively. Both trypsin and the PAR-2 ligand SLIGKV promoted integrin α5β1-mediated adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin, and less effectively integrin αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not that to type IV collagen or laminin-1 at all. Thrombin and the PAR-1 ligand SFLLRN promoted the cell adhesion to vitronectin more strongly than trypsin or the PAR-2 ligand, but not the cell adhesion to fibronectin at all. The cell adhesion-stimulating effect of the PAR-2 ligand was significantly reduced by the pre-treatment of cells with trypsin, indicating that the effect of trypsin is mediated by PAR-2 activation. The trypsin-stimulated cell adhesion to vitronectin, but not to fibronectin, was effectively inhibited by the Giprotein blocker pertussis toxin, and both cell adhesions were completely inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Furthermore, trypsin and the PAR-2 ligand stimulated growth of MKN-1 cells more strongly than thrombin or the PAR-1 ligand.

These results suggest that tumor-derived trypsin not only contributes to the ECM degradation but also modulates growth and adhesion properties of cancer cells in an autocrine manner. On the other hand, physiological roles of trypsin expressed by normal non-pancreatic cells remain to be clarified. It has long been known that trypsin, thrombin, and other proteinases stimulate DNA synthesis and cell division of fibroblasts in culture (14.Sefton B.M. Rubin H.

Haematol. 1996; 92: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A few studies have suggested that the stimulatory effect of thrombin on cell adhesion is mediated by thrombin receptor, a member of G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane domain receptor family termed proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) (20.Nierodzik M.L. Bain R.M. Liu L.X. Shivji M. Takeshita K. Karpatkin S. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Up to now, four members of the PAR family, PARs-1, -2, -3, and -4, have been identified (21.Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9200-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22.Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1429-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PARs are cleaved by serine proteinases within the extracellular N terminus, allowing the new N terminus to bind and activate the receptors themselves (21.Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9200-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PAR-1 (thrombin receptor) and PAR-3, which are expressed mainly in platelets, endothelium, and leukocytes, are effectively activated by thrombin (23.Vu T.-K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

In contrast, PAR-2, which is expressed in a wide variety of epithelial tissues, endothelial cells, T cells, smooth muscle cells and tumor cell lines, is activated by trypsin but not by thrombin (22.Dery O.

In common to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), activated PARs induce G protein-mediated signal transduction, stimulating generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, intracellular calcium mobilization, arachidonic acid release, and prostaglandin secretion (22.Dery O.

Thus PARs are thought to be involved in various pathophysiological processes, including development, cell growth and inflammation (22.Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1429-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the natural activator of PAR-2 remains uncertain despite the wide distribution of the receptor (29.Fox M.T. Harriott P. Walker B. Stone S.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

Human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-1 was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). This cell line was cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. RPMI 1640 (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 1.2 mg/ml NaHCO3, and 2 mm glutamine was used as the basal medium. Culture was maintained in the basal medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Adhesion of MKN-1 cells to ECM proteins was assayed by the method reported previously (30.Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). Each well of 96-well plates (Sumibe Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was incubated with 100 μl of each ECM protein solution at indicated concentrations at 37 °C overnight. The plates were blocked with 200 μl of 1.2% (w/v) BSA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 1.5 h and then washed with PBS. Cells were harvested by incubating with 6.6 mm EDTA in PBS in the presence or absence of 6.25 μm (150 μg/ml) trypsin at 37 °C for 10 min. After inactivation of trypsin with 50 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, the cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and suspended into the serum-free medium containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml. The cell suspension (100 μl) was inoculated into each well of the ECM protein-coated plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Non-adherent cells were removed by gentle agitation, and adherent cells were fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained with 100 μl of 0.0005% (w/v) Hoechst 33342–0.001% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 1.5 h. The fluorescent intensity of each well of the plates was measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore, Bedford, MA). MKN-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) were harvested, suspended in 1.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mmMgCl2 and 2 mm CaCl2 and homogenized by a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 7 min, and the supernatants were again centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant precipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-integrin α5 polyclonal antibody and with anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibody. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (4.Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Miyazaki K.

Molecular weight (M r) markers (prestained SDS-PAGE standards; Bio-Rad) used are rabbit skeletal muscle myosin (M r 207,000), E. coli β-galactosidase (M r 121,000), BSA (M r 81,000), and chicken egg ovalbumin (M r 51, 200). Total RNA was prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), human lung carcinoma cell line A549, and human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN-1 with Trizol reagent according to manufacturer's protocol. Twenty micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed with Mo-MLV reverse transcriptase, and one-fifth of the transcript was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as previously reported (2.Koshikawa N. Nagashima Y. Miyagi Y. Yanoma S. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction consisted of incubation for 4 min at 94 °C and subsequent 30 cycles of incubations at 94 °C for 1 min, at 60 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1.5 min.

Our previous study showed that MKN-1 human gastric carcinoma cells transfected with trypsinogen-1 cDNA grow faster and adhere to fibronectin substrate more efficiently than the parent MKN-1 cells (13.Miyata S.

In the present study, first we examined effect of trypsin treatment on adhesion of the parent MKN-1 cells, which secrete neither trypsinogen nor trypsin, to a plastic plate precoated with various concentrations of the cell adhesion proteins fibronectin. In this experiment, MKN-1 cells were harvested by incubating with EDTA in the presence or absence of 6.25 μm trypsin for 10 min. After inactivation of trypsin with soybean trypsin inhibitor, cells were incubated on the fibronectin-coated plastic plate at 37 °C for 1 h. Trypsin treatment increased the cell adhesion to fibronectin substrate 2–4-fold at low fibronectin concentrations (0.6–1.2 μg/ml) (Fig. 1). The trypsin-treated cells more rapidly spread on the fibronectin substrate than the control cells (Fig. 2). Trypsin treatment at 12.5 μm showed almost the same effect as that at 6.25 μm (data not shown). On the other hand, trypsin treatment at 6.25 μm rather decreased the cell adhesion to vitronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin-1 (data not shown).Figure 2Morphology of MKN-1 cells harvested with EDTA alone or with EDTA plus trypsin on fibronectin substrate. MKN-1 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h on 24-well plates precoated with 500 μl of 0.625 μg/ml fibronectin. Other experimental conditions are the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the mechanism of the trypsin-stimulated cell adhesion of MKN-1 cells, quantitative and qualitative changes of integrin α5β1, the primary receptor for fibronectin, were analyzed by immunoblotting analysis after trypsin treatment of MKN-1 cells. When MKN-1 cells were treated with 6.25 μmtrypsin for 10 min, the apparent amount of cell surface integrin α5 was decreased to less than 50% after the trypsin treatment, and about half the amount of the 150-kDa integrin β1 molecule was partially hydrolyzed to a 140-kDa protein (data not shown). These changes were not clearly detected when the cells were treated with 0.1 μm trypsin. It has been reported that trypsin activates PAR-2 efficiently, stimulating signal transduction through G proteins (23.Vu T.-K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar,25.Santulli R.J. Derian C.K. Darrow A.L. Tomko K.A. Eckardt A.J. Seiberg M. Scarborough R.M. Andrade-Gordon P.

Therefore, the activation of PARs seemed to be a possible mechanism for the stimulatory effect of trypsin on adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin. First, we examined the expression of PAR-1 and PAR-2 mRNAs in MKN-1 cells by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 3). The PCR product amplified with PAR-1 primers was detected at a size of 708 base pairs in MKN-1 cells as well as in HUVECs as a positive control (23.Vu T.-K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar). The PCR product amplified with PAR-2 primers was detected at a size of 358 base pairs in MKN-1 cells as well as in A549 cells as a positive control (27.Böhm S.K. Kong W. Brömme D. Smeekens P.S.

The nucleotide sequences of the PCR products of PAR-1 and PAR-2 in MKN-1 cells were all identical to their corresponding sequences (data not shown). Thrombin and trypsin cleave the N-terminal, extracellular tethered sequences of PAR-1 and PAR-2, respectively, at a specific site, allowing the new terminal sequences of 6 amino acids to bind to the respective PARs (21.Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9200-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptides for the new N-terminal sequences, so-called tethered ligands, can be used as the active ligands for PARs to investigate PAR-mediated signal transduction (21.Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9200-9202Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,31.Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the effects of trypsin, thrombin, and the PAR-1- and the PAR-2-activating peptides as the PAR ligands, on adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin, vitronectin, type IV collagen, and laminin-1 (Fig. 4). In this experiment, MKN-1 cells harvested with EDTA were incubated with each of the proteinases and the PAR-activating peptides for 30 min and then inoculated on fibronectin-, vitronectin-, type IV collagen-, and laminin-1-coated plates. Trypsin at a concentration of 0.1 μm, but not thrombin, enhanced the cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 4 A). Although the PAR-1-activating peptide (SFLLRN) did not have significant effect, the PAR-2-activating peptide (SLIGKV) enhanced the cell adhesion over 2-fold as compared with the control peptide (LSIGKV), which had the same amino acid composition as the PAR-2 peptide. In contrast, all of trypsin, thrombin, and PAR-1- and PAR-2-activating peptides dose-dependently enhanced the cell adhesion to vitronectin (Fig. 4 B). The cell adhesion stimulating activity on vitronectin was significantly higher in thrombin than trypsin and in the PAR-1-activating peptide than the PAR-2-activating peptide at any concentrations tested. When the trypsin concentration was increased to 6.25 μm, the cell adhesion was rather inhibited (data not shown). Any of the proteinases and the PAR-activating peptides did not enhance the adhesion of MKN-1 cells to type IV collagen or laminin-1 (Fig. 4, C and D). Both trypsin and thrombin at 0.1 μm rather inhibited the cell adhesion to laminin-1, presumably due to the degradation of related integrins. We also examined cell surface integrins responsible for the adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin or vitronectin enhanced by treatments with the proteinases and the PAR-activating peptides. For this experiment, the proteinase- or peptide-treated MKN-1 cells were incubated with anti-integrin α5 (P1D6), anti-integrin β1(P4C10), or anti-integrin αvβ3 (LM609) monoclonal antibody, all of which are neutralizing antibodies, and then inoculated to fibronectin- or vitronectin-coated plates. The adhesion to fibronectin of MKN-1 cells stimulated by trypsin or the PAR-2-activating peptide, as well as that of non-stimulated MKN-1 cells, was almost completely blocked by any of the anti-integrin α5 and anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibodies, indicating that integrin α5β1was responsible for the enhanced cell adhesion (Fig.5 A). When the cell adhesion of MKN-1 cells to vitronectin was similarly tested, it was partially blocked by anti-integrin αvβ3 monoclonal antibody but not by anti-integrin α5 or anti-integrin β1 monoclonal antibody, regardless of the type of treatment. This indicated that integrin αvβ3 is mainly responsible for the cell adhesion to vitronectin (Fig. 5 B). The results shown above suggest that trypsin stimulates integrin α5β1-mediated adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin through PAR-2 activation. To confirm this possibility, we examined if trypsin treatment of MKN-1 cells desensitizes PAR-2 for the second challenge by the PAR-2-activating peptide. Although proteolytic activation of PARs is irreversible, their rapid resensitization occurs due to de novo synthesis and the trafficking of pre-formed receptors from intracellular pools (22.Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: 1429-1452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid resensitization of PAR-2 after trypsin treatment is effectively suppressed by the protein-trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (32.Cocks T., M. Fong B. Chow J., M. Anderson G.P. Frauman A., G. Goldie R., G. Henry P., J. Carr M., J. Hamilton J., R. Moffatt J., D. Nature. 1999; 398: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In this experiment, therefore, MKN-1 cells were initially treated with trypsin for 30 min, left in the presence or absence of brefeldin A or cycloheximide for 3 h, and then treated with the PAR-2-activating peptide SLIGKV. In the absence of the inhibitors, the treatment with the PAR-2-activating peptide SLIGKV increased the cell adhesion to fibronectin of non-stimulated cells by about 110% and that of trypsin-stimulated cells by about 75%, indicating that trypsin-treated cells had been well resensitized (Fig.6). Even in non-stimulated cells, both brefeldin A and cycloheximide significantly decreased the cell adhesion. When non-stimulated cells and trypsin-stimulated cells were compared in the presence of brefeldin A, the treatment with the PAR-2-activating peptide increased the cell adhesion of non-treated cells by 159% but increased that of trypsin-treated cells by only 27%. Essentially the same result was obtained when cycloheximide was used in stead of brefeldin A. These results indicated that the PAR-2-activating peptide could not restimulate the adhesion of the trypsin-treated cells when intracellular protein trafficking or protein synthesis was blocked. This strongly suggests that the trypsin-stimulated cell adhesion is mediated by the activation of PAR-2. G proteins are heterotrimers consisting of α, β, and γ subunits, and the α subunit is grouped into four classes on the basis of sequence homology: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 (33.Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). PAR-1-dependent or other GPCR signalings are often inhibited by pertussis toxin, which inactivates by ADP-ribosylation the α subunits of the Gi class such as three forms of αi (αi1, αi2, and αi3) and two forms of α0(α01 and α02) (34.Chung J. Gao A.-G Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 35.LaMorte V.J. Harootunian A.T. Spiegel A.M. Tsien R.Y. Feramisco J.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27372-27377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Gi proteins in the trypsin-stimulated cell adhesion, effect of pertussis toxin on the stimulation of the MKN-1 cell adhesion by trypsin or the PAR-2-activating peptide was investigated in this study. The stimulatory effects of trypsin and the PAR-2 ligand on adhesion of MKN-1 cells to fibronectin were hardly blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig.7 A), whereas their stimulatory effects on the cell adhesion to vitronectin were almost completely blocked by pertussis toxin (Fig. 7 B). This differential sensitivity to pertussis toxin indicates that Gi protein mediates the activation of integrin αvβ3-dependent cell adhesion by the PAR-2 signal, whereas a different G protein might be involved in the activation of integrin α5β1-dependent cell adhesion. It is well known that the Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases play important roles in PAR-1-dependent and other GPCR signalings (36.Chen"

Cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2p) accumulates as a precursor in cox20 mutants, suggesting a defect in biogenesis of this mitochondrially encoded protein. The inability of cox20 mutants to process the subunit 2 precursor (pCox2p) is not due to impaired export of the protein across the inner membrane or to an inactive Imp1p/Imp2p peptidase.

All of the endogenous pCox2p accumulated in an Δimp1 mutant, and a small fraction of Cox2p in wild type yeast, is detected in a complex with Cox20p. Following maturation Cox2p remained associated with Cox20p, prior to assembling into the cytochrome oxidase complex.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cox2p is synthesized with an N-terminal presequence of 15 amino acids, which is removed following its export to the intermembrane space but prior to assembly of the protein into the functional enzyme complex (47.Tzagoloff A.

Another mitochondrial protein involved in processing of pCox2p, Som1p, was identified as a multicopy suppressor of temperature-sensitiveimp1 mutants (18.Esser K. Pratje E. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen.

Respiratory-deficient pet mutants of S. cerevisiae are powerful tools for studying different aspects of mitochondrial function and biogenesis (for review see Ref. 19.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants have been grouped into broad phenotypic classes based on their cytochrome spectra and the enzymatic activities of the respiratory chain complexes. An important class of pet mutants is defined by cytochrome oxidase-deficient strains (20.McEwen J.E. Cameron V.L. Poyton R.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 831-835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is encountered not only in mutants with lesions in the structural genes of the enzyme but also in a large number of other strains that are defective in expression of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase subunits 1–3 (for review see Refs. 21.Capaldi R.A.

To ascertain whether there are still other factors required for the biogenesis of Cox2p, we have screened a group of cytochrome oxidase yeast mutants for defects in processing the Cox2p precursor. We report a new gene, designated COX20, whose product functions in Cox2p maturation. This gene is defined by the complementation group G92 of a previously described pet collection (19.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product of this gene, Cox20p, is an integral protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Accumulation of pCox2p in cox20 mutants is not a consequence of a defect in translocation of the Cox2p precursor across the inner membrane by the Oxa1p machinery. Cox20p is also not essential for the intrinsic proteolytic activity of the Imp1p-Imp2p complex. Instead, Cox20p functions at a step subsequent to export of the pCox2p. We present evidence that Cox20p binds to the exported pCox2p species and chaperones it through the Imp1p processing step and perhaps subsequent assembly into the cytochrome oxidase complex. The genotypes and sources of the yeast strains used in this study are listed in TableI. The OXA1disruption/deletion strain (aW303ΔOXA1) (Δoxa1) was constructed by replacing the nucleotides 220–1038 of the open reading frame encoding Oxa1p, with the HIS3 gene, as described (32.Arnold I.

Plasmid DNA isolated from C176/L6/T1 was amplified inEscherichia coli and used to subclone COX20. A partially deleted allele of COX20 was made by transferring the 1.7-kilobase pair HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the entire gene to YEp352 (35.Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. Yeast. 1986; 2: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid pG92/ST3 was digested with StuI which cleavesCOX20 internally at a position corresponding to codon 194 and ligated to an 8-nucleotide-long SacI linker. This plasmid was digested with SacI removing the sequence coding for the 72 residues of the C-terminal half of the protein and was ligated to a 1.1-kilobase pair SacI fragment containing the yeast URA3 gene. The mutant allele was introduced into the diploid strain W303 by the one-step gene replacement procedure (36.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Transformants prototrophic for uracil were sporulated, and haploid spores (W303ΔCOX20) with the Δcox20::URA3 allele were recovered by tetrad dissection. The presence of the null allele in one of the respiratory-deficient spores (aW303ΔCOX20) (Δcox20) was verified by Southern analysis of genomic DNA. Antibodies were obtained against Cox20p expressed from a trpE fusion gene. AnEcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the entire gene was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification with primers 5′-GGGGGGATCCGAATTCACCATGCGTTGGTGGCCGTGG and 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGGATCCTCACCAGAACTTGTACCATTTC. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and was ligated in-frame to the N-terminal coding region of trpE in pATH20 (37.Koerner T.J. Hill J.E. Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).E. coli transformed with this plasmid, expressed a protein of approximately 60 kDa that co-fractionated quantitatively with the insoluble protein fraction. The fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits after solubilization with SDS and partial purification on a Bio-Gel A 0.5 sizing column (Bio-Rad). Biotinylated Cox20p was expressed from a fusion gene consisting of COX20 fused at its 3′ end to a sequence coding for the biotinylation site of bacterial transcarboxylase (38.Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The gene with 325 nucleotides of 5′ sequence and its termination replaced with a BamHI site was polymerase chain reaction-amplified with the forward primer 5′-CACACAACCGAATTCAGTATCAGC and reverse primer 5′-GGGCGGATCCC-CAGAACTTGTACCATTTC. Following digestion withEcoRI and HindIII, the modified gene was ligated in-frame to the transcarboxylase sequence in the 2-μm plasmid YEp352-Bio6 (29.Glerum D.M. Koerner T.J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15585-15590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This plasmid pG92/ST20 was introduced into the wild type haploid strain W303-1A yielding the transformant aW303/ST20. The fusion gene was also targeted to the chromosomal URA3 locus of W303-1B. The transformed clone αW303/ST25 with the integrated version of the gene was crossed to aW303ΔCOX20 (Δcox20), and the resultant diploid cells were sporulated. The ability of the fusion gene to complement the cox20 null mutation was confirmed by tetrad dissections. Mitochondria were initially subjected to hypotonic swelling by diluting 10-fold in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the presence of 1 mm ATP for 30 min on ice. Resulting mitoplasts were reisolated by centrifugation (Sigma, rotor 12154, 7 min, 10,000 rpm) and suspended to a protein concentration of 1.34 mg/ml in 230 μl of translation buffer (39.Herrmann J.M. Foelsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar), containing pyruvate kinase (0.9 units), malate (2.5 mm), and succinate (2.5 mm). After 5 min of incubation at 25 °C, NADH (2 mm) and 1.2 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml) were added, and samples were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C. Translation was stopped by the addition of unlabeled methionine (30 mm) and puromycin (42 μg/ml). Samples were divided, and proteinase K treatment (50 μg/ml) of 1 aliquot was performed, as described previously (40.Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. In vitrolabeling of mitochondrial translation products, followed by the addition of cold methionine and puromycin, was performed with a protein concentration of 3.3 mg/ml as described (39.Herrmann J.M. Foelsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 538-544Google Scholar) except the translation buffer used contained no bovine serum albumin, and the Tris/HCl buffer was substituted with HEPES. Mitochondria were isolated, washed, and resuspended in 150 μl of SHKCl (0.6 m sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, pH 7.2). Samples were either mock-treated (−) or incubated with the chemical cross-linkerN-succinimidyl 3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionate (SPDP, 0.3 mm) (+) for 15 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of glycine, pH 8 (100 mm). Isolated mitochondria were lysed in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) and were diluted 20-fold with TBS/Triton X-100 buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitation of cross-linked adducts, using preimmune or specific antiserum against either Cox20p or Cox2p, was performed essentially as described before (9.Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 40.Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Antibodies against Cox20p and preimmune serum (100 μl each) were covalently bound to 15 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the cross-linker dimethyl pimelidate, as described (42.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 521-523Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria (1 mg/ml) were solubilized gently for 30 min at 4 °C in digitonin buffer (1% digitonin, 150 mm KOAc, 30 mm HEPES at pH 7.4, 2 mm MgOAc, 2 mm ATP, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml α2-macroglobulin). After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was divided and incubated under gentle shaking conditions for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose beads bearing either antibodies specific for Cox20p or from preimmune serum. The beads were washed three times with the digitonin buffer lacking the protease inhibitors, except phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. The co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, followed by immune decoration with Cox2p-specific antiserum. Growth of yeast strains and isolation of mitochondria was performed, as described previously (39.Herrmann J.M. Foelsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 1.

Outer membrane vesicle preparation, alkaline extraction, and mitoplasting were performed as described (32.Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H.

Protein was estimated according to published methods (45.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Enzymatic measurement of respiratory chain activities was performed essentially as described before (47.Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8228-8235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial translation products were labeled with [35S]methionine in total yeast cells, as previously published (48.Douglas M. Finkelstein D. Butow R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 49.Van Dyck L. Neupert W. Langer T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Detection of blotted proteins following SDS-PAGE was performed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). C176/L6 is 1 of 11 independent isolates previously assigned to complementation group G92 of a collection of respiratory- defective pet mutants (19.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain is deficient in cytochrome oxidase activity (TableII) and lacks the absorption bands of cytochromes a and a 3 (Fig.1). Other segments of the respiratory chain, measured as NADH-cytochrome c reductase, are normal or even somewhat elevated. Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is also comparable with that of wild type yeast.Table IIRespiratory and ATPase activities of mitochondria from wild type and cox20 mutants refer to μmol of ATP hydrolyzed or of cytochrome c reduced or oxidized per min per mg of mitochondrial protein as described under “Experimental Procedures”.StrainATPaseNADH-cytochrome creductaseCytochrome oxidase−Oligomycin+OligomycinWT3.501.130.781.78Δcox203.631.090.65<0.01C176/L63.680.910.740.09 Open table in a new tab Transformation of C176/L6 with a yeast genomic library yielded a clone whose respiratory competence was ascertained to depend on a segregating plasmid (pG92/T1). The DNA insert of pG92/T1 was approximately 3 kilobase pairs in length and spanned nucleotides 925,368 to 928,408 of chromosome IV. This region contains three entire reading frames (Fig.2 A), the longest of which (YDR229w) was unlikely to be the gene since the subclone pG92/ST3 lacking the N-terminal coding region of the YDR229w reading frame was able to restore respiration in C176/L6. The other two open reading frames YDR230w and YDR231c contained a substantial degree of sequence overlap. The identity of YDR231c as the gene responsible for conferring respiration to C176/L6 was established in several ways. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified reading frames corresponding to YDR231c and YDR230w were cloned in the CEN plasmid pYX122 (Novagen) behind the triose-phosphate isomerase promoter. Only the construct containing reading frame YDR231c was able to restore growth of the mutant on non-fermentable substrates. This was also true of a plasmid construct expressing YDR231c fused at its C terminus to an 8-kDa peptide containing the biotinylation site of bacterial transcarboxylase (38.Murtif V.L. Bahler C.R. Samols D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5617-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the open reading frame YDR230w was not able to restore growth using both types of assays. In keeping with the previously used convention for designating genes affecting cytochrome oxidase, the gene YDR231c defined by complementation group G92 has been namedCOX20. COX20 was partially deleted in a respiratory competent strain of yeast, W303-1A. The resulting null mutant aW303ΔCOX20 (Δcox20) had a phenotype similar to that observed in C176/L6 (Fig. 1 and Table II). It lacked cytochromes a anda 3 (Fig. 1) and had reduced cytochrome oxidase but not NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity (Table II). Oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was also not affected. Allelism tests provided additional evidence that C176/L6 carries a mutation in COX20. An integrative plasmid containing the sequence of COX20 from the HindIII site upstream of the initiation codon and ending immediately after the termination codon (pG92/ST18) was linearized at the unique SphI site inside the gene (Fig. 2 A). Leucine prototrophic clones obtained by transformation of C176/L6 with the linear plasmid were respiratory-competent consistent with integration of the linear plasmid at the cox20 locus thereby creating one wild type copy of the gene. This was corroborated by crosses of two independent Leu+ transformants to the respiratory competent haploid strain W303-1A and to the isogenic strain Δcox20 with the null allele. All of the tetrads from cross to the wild type strain consisted of four respiratory-competent spores, whereas in the cross to Δcox20, two spores were respiratory-competent. These results indicated tight linkage of the mutation in C176/L6 to thecox20::URA3 allele and together with the biochemical data constitute strong evidence that C176/L6 has a mutation in COX20. The molecular mass of Cox20p based on the gene sequence is 23,761 kDa (Fig. 2 B). The protein has two putative transmembrane domains between residues 91–109 and 116–132 (Fig. 2 C). The sequences preceding the first transmembrane domain and following the second transmembrane domain are hydrophilic with an equal number of acidic and basic residues. The N-terminal sequence of Cox20p does not resemble a typical mitochondrial import signal, which characteristically are rich in basic and hydroxylated residues (50.von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Neither is it possible to discern an internal (40.Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20937-20942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) which would clearly qualify as an import signal. Cox20p does not exhibit any sequence similarity to other known proteins in the current data bases. The mitochondrial localization of Cox20p was determined in two ways. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a protein expressed from atrpE/COX20 fusion gene. By using this antisera, a protein of ∼23 kDa was detected in mitochondria and not in the cytoplasm of wild type yeast. This protein was absent in the Δcox20 mitochondria (Fig.3 A). Independent evidence that Cox20p is a constituent of mitochondria was obtained with a biotin-tagged form of the protein. COX20-BIOcoding for Cox20p with a C-terminal biotinylation signal fully complemented the Δcox20 mutant, either on a multicopy plasmid or chromosomally integrated. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins from the transformants were analyzed by Western blotting and immune decoration with antibodies against Cox20p (Fig. 3 A) or by probing with peroxidase coupled to avidin (Fig. 3 B). Both methods revealed the presence of a novel biotinylated component of the expected size (31 kDa) in mitochondria of the yeast transformants. As expected, the biotinylated protein was present in higher concentrations in cells transformed with the gene on a multicopy plasmid. The submitochondrial localization of Cox20p was examined in wild type yeast and in the Δcox20 mutant with a chromosomally integratedCOX20-BIO gene. Cox20p is an intrinsic membrane protein as it was resistant to extraction with sodium carbonate (Fig.4 A). Cox20p was not present in purified mitochondrial outer membranes (Fig. 4 B). Both native and biotinylated Cox20p were protected against proteinase K in intact mitochondria but not in mitoplasts prepared by hypotonic swelling of mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and D). No C-terminal fragment of the Cox20p with the biotin tag was observed following proteolytic treatment of mitoplasts, suggesting this domain is accessible to protease in the intermembrane space (Fig.4 D). The apparent protease sensitivity of the C terminus in the intermembrane space and the presence of two predicted transmembrane segments would suggest Cox20p has an Nout–Coutorientation in the membrane, with a short hydrophilic loop in the matrix. In vivo labeling of the mitochondrial translation products indicated that cox20 mutants are capable of synthesizing subunits 1–3 of the cytochrome oxidase (Fig.5 A). In contrast to wild type cells, newly synthesized cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (Cox2p) accumulated as the precursor form (pCox2p) in the C176/L6 and Δcox20 strains (Fig. 5 A). The precursor form was also evident in the control Δoxa1 mitochondria (aW303ΔOXA1, a null mutant of"

Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because this model of Fhit function depends on forming complexes with inabundant substrates, and recognition (and stabilization) of these complexes by a Fhit effector, it was important to assay the more abundant cellular mononucleotides as competitive inhibitors of Fhit. To a first approximation, the cellular abundance of a Fhit-ApnA complex is expected to be a function of the equilibrium binding constant of Fhit for that ApnA, the binding constants of Fhit for competing compounds, the abundance of Fhit and each compound, and the lifetimes of these complexes, potentially as modulated by cellular proteins. In the past, determination of the K m values for competing substrates would have required assaying products from each substrate. Determination of KI values for competitive inhibitors would have required measuring rates of [3H]AMP and [3H]ADP formation from [3H]ApppA as a function of each inhibitor (18.Barnes L.D. Robinson A.K. Mumford C.H. Garrison P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 144: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A recently reported method of visualizing ApppA reaction products by staining them with SYBR GREEN II is unsuitable for kinetic measurements (19.Ji L. Fang B. Roth J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Dietheno-ApppA has also been synthesized and shown to be a Fhit substrate with a 2 μm K m (20.Asensio A.C. Oaknin S. Rotllan P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here, we synthesized novel fluorescent analogs of ApppA by joining thiol-reactive derivatives of 7-diethylamino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) and 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacine-3-yl (BODIPY FL) to ATPγS and GTPγS. We characterized the resulting ApppAMC, ApppBODIPY, and GpppBODIPY compounds biochemically and found them to be sensitive probes of Fhit activity. Despite a lack of any fluorescence acceptor function on guanine, GpppBODIPY had fluorescence that was more than 5-fold quenched relative to parental BODIPY compounds and with respect to the ppBODIPY enzymatic product. Proton NMR measurements reported herein provide evidence for the proximity of the guanine to BODIPY, suggesting that BODIPY fluorescence is quenched by a stacked or collisional mechanism (21.Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Having developed fluorescent and fluorogenic assays for the Fhit active site, we titrated unlabeled competitive inhibitors into these assay to determine the K m of Fhit for ApppA, AppppA, ApppppA, ATPαS, and GTPαS, and the KI of Fhit for AMP, inorganic pyrophosphate, and monophosphate. Surprisingly, pyrophosphate competes 10-fold better for the Fhit active site than do purine mononucleotides. The results indicate that the ability of Fhit to function as an ApnA-dependent signaling protein in epithelial tumor suppression may depend on a hierarchy of competing compounds: ApnA competing out pyrophosphate, and pyrophosphate competing out purine mononucleotides. ATPγS or GTPγS tetralithium salts (25 mg, Sigma 85% pure, 0.05 mmol) were dissolved in 3 ml of water, buffered to pH 9.0 with sodium bicarbonate. Equimolar amounts of thiol-reactive fluorescent dyes (7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (22.Khalfan H. Abuknesha R. Rand-Weaver M. Price R.G. Robinson D. Histochem.

Ny T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7801-7806Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar), Molecular Probes) were added in 3.0 ml of dioxane. Reactions were stirred and monitored by silica gel TLC, using dioxane:2-propanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (40:20:35:35) as the mobile phase. ATPγS, GTPγS, and the unreacted dyes migrated withRF values of 0.25, 0.20, and 0.95, respectively, while fluorescent adenosine nucleotide products had anRF of 0.7 and GpppBODIPY had anRF of 0.65. When, after several hours, reactions were judged complete by TLC, the resulting solutions were concentrated via rotary evaporation to 2 ml. Crude products were applied to an aqueous 2 × 30-cm column of Sephadex LH-20 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Pooling and lyophilization of pure product fractions afforded nucleotide-dye conjugates as their sodium salts with 76–86% yield. For ApppAMC, 1H NMR (D2O) peaks were 8.51 (s, 1H, adenosine H2); 8.10 (s, 1H, adenosine H8); 7.55 (m, 2H, dye CH-3 and CH-5); 7.38 (m, 4H, dye phenyl); 6.81 (m, 1H, dye CH-6); 6.59 (d, 1H, dye CH-8); 6.10 (d, 1H, C1); 4.6 (m, 1H, -C(O)CHS-); 4.3 (m, 3H, C2,C3,C4); 3.50 (m, 6H, C5 + NCH2CH3); 2.17 (s, 2H, C(O)-CH2-CH); 1.22 (t, 6H, NCH2CH3); and 31P (D2O) peaks were 6.5 ppm (d, 1P); -9.3 (m, 1P); -21.4 (m, 1P). For ApppBODIPY, the proton peaks were 8.31 (s, 1H, adenosine H2); 8.03 (s, 1H, adenosine H8); 7.29 (s, 1H, dye CH); 6.83 (d, 1H, dye CH); 6.40 (d, 1H, dye CH); 6.29 (s, 1H, dye CH); 5.98 (d, 1H, C1); 4.59 (s, 2H, -C(O)CH2S-); 4.51 (d, 2H, C5); 4.3 (m, 3H, C2,C3,C4); 3.75 (d, 2H, dye CH2NH-); 2.47 (s, 3H, dye CH3); 2.28 (s, 3H, dye CH3); and phosphorous peaks were 8.6 ppm (d, 1P); -9.4 (d, 1P); -21.45 (dd, 1P). For GpppBODIPY, the proton peaks were 7.90 (s, 1H, guanosine C8); 7.83 (br s, 1H, NH); 7.77 (br m, 4H, NH2 and OH); 7.29 (s, 1H, dye CH); 6.92 (s, 1H, dye CH); 6.39 (s, 1H, dye CH); 6.25 (s, 1H, dye CH); 5.73 (m, 1H, C1); 4.57 (s, 2H, SCH2); 4.49 (t, 1H, C3); 4.41 (br s, 1H, C2); 4.28 (br s, 1H, C4); 4.21 (dd, 2H, C5); 3.79 (dq, 2H, NCH2); 2.43 (s, 3H, dye CH3); and 2.25 (s, 3H, dye CH3). The covalent structures of ApppA, ApppAMC, ApppBODIPY, and GpppBODIPY are represented in Fig. 1. Fluorescent substrates at 1–30 μm were incubated with purified Fhit protein (16.Brenner C. Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Rosler A. Liu X.H. Blackburn G.M. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Barnes L.D. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1461-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in reactions at 37 °C containing 20 mm Na HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Competitive compounds, when indicated, were mixed with fluorescent substrate at 8–10 concentrations, surrounding theK m or KI values of the competitor. Reaction samples (≤5 μl) were spotted on silica TLC plates (E. Merck) at 60–120-s intervals. Plates were air-dried and developed in 2-propanol:NH4OH:1,4-dioxane:H2O (50:35:8:7 for ApppAMC and ApppBODIPY; 50:33:6:11 for GpppBODIPY). Developed plates were imaged by epi-UV illumination and quantitated on a Bio-Rad Fluor-S instrument using Multi-Analyst 1.0.2 software. Three types of thin layer assays were performed. First-order decay assays, reactions in which time courses of complete consumption of low concentrations of fluorescent substrate were measured, were used to determine the specificity constant,k cat/K m. Initial rate assays, reactions that measured the rates of appearance of the first few percent of products formed as a function of substrate concentration, were used to determine k cat andK m. Competitive inhibition assays, first-order assays with titration of nonlabeled competitive inhibitors, were used to determine binding constants of competitors from their ability to reducek cat/K m (apparent). For first-order decay assays, substrate fluorescence minus background fluorescence was obtained in arbitrary units. Plots of log[remaining substrate] against time yielded experimental slopes, having units of s−1, which were multiplied by −1/[enzyme], to obtain values of k cat/K m ork cat/K m(apparent). For initial rate assays, ppBODIPY fluorescence was converted to picomoles with a standard product curve and k catand K m values were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots (24.Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publications, New York1987Google Scholar). For calculation of KI (orK m) in competitive inhibition assays,k cat/K m apparent values were plotted against [I] and values ofk cat/K m andKI (or K m) were determined using Equation 1. kcatKm (apparent)=kcatKm−[I]kcatKM[I]+KIEquation 1 In these experiments, the value fork cat/K m, although treated as an independent variable, was always within 15% of the experimentally determined value. Reactions in black 96-well plates containing GpppBODIPY at 1.25–40 μm in 60 μl of 20 mm Na HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MnCl2, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were initiated with addition of 167 fmol of Fhit and incubated for 300–360 s at 37 °C. Duplicate reactions were stopped by addition of 60 μl of 200 mmsodium citrate, pH 3.0, and read with a Wallach Victor2Multilabel Counter 1420 with a 485-nm excitation filer and a 535-nm emission filter. At each substrate concentration, mock reactions were created by mixing 0%, 5%, and 10% volumes of acid-stopped complete hydrolysates with acid-stopped mock reactions (100%, 95%, and 90%). Fluorescent emissions of experimental and mock reactions were counted and plotted to calculate ppBODIPY production per active site per second at each concentration of GpppBODIPY. To prove that ApppA, pyrophosphate, and AMP are competitive inhibitors, these compounds were titrated into 96-well GpppBODIPY assays at four concentrations at each of five concentrations of GpppBODIPY (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 μm). Initial rates as a function of GpppBODIPY and inhibitor concentration were plotted by the method of Eadie and Hofstee (24.Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publications, New York1987Google Scholar). HIT proteins are a superfamily of homodimeric nucleotide-binding proteins with a unique mode of nucleotide recognition (14.Brenner C. Bieganowski P. Pace H.C. Huebner K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Each monomer contributes 5 strands to a 10-stranded anti-parallel β sheet that forms two identical purine nucleotide-binding sites (9.Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A.

In Hint dimers, the two nucleotide-binding sites accommodate two equivalents of AMP or GMP with the α phosphates proximal to the catalytic histidines (9.Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In Fhit dimers bound to ApnA, one pair of AMP moieties are buried proximal to the catalytic histidines with polyphosphate chains extending from the tightly bound AMP groups to expose the second pair of adenosines in a solvent-accessible site near Thr-79 (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because Fhit tolerates substitutions of the second adenosine (3.Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 11.Abend A. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3668-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we expected that Fhit would hydrolyze ApppX-type substrates to produce AMP plus ppX. Thiol-reactive fluorescent dyes, 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (22.Khalfan H. Abuknesha R. Rand-Weaver M. Price R.G. Robinson D. Histochem. J. 1986; 18: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and BODIPY FL C1-iodoacetamide (23.Karolin J. Johansson L.B.-A. Strandberg L. Ny T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7801-7806Crossref Scopus (562) Google Scholar), which were initially synthesized to label protein thiols, were reacted with ATPγS to generate first generation fluorescent compounds, ApppAMC and ApppBODIPY. The second generation substrate, GpppBODIPY, was made by conjugating BODIPY FL C1-iodoacetamide to GTPγS. Fluorescent substrates are depicted in Fig. 1. At substrate concentrations below K m, reactions proceed with first-order kinetics such that the negative slope of a plot of log[remaining substrate] against time equalsk cat/K m times the enzyme concentration (24.Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. Dover Publications, New York1987Google Scholar). To test whether Fhit would tolerate substitution of one adenosine in a fluorescent ApppA analog, we incubated 0.5–2.5 nm Fhit with 1.5–5 μm ApppAMC and ApppBODIPY. Time courses of such reactions, analyzed by TLC and digitally imaged upon UV illumination, made it clear that Fhit cleaves each substrate, generating one fluorescent product with reduced chromatographic mobility (Fig. 2,A and B). One thousand times more concentrated substrates were required to visualize the nonfluorescent product by UV shadowing on TLC plates with fluorescent indicator (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and, as expected, that product was indistinguishable from AMP (data not shown). Thus, Fhit cleaves ApppAMC and ApppBODIPY to produce AMP + ppAMC and AMP + ppBODIPY, respectively. At an initial substrate concentration of 3 μm ApppAMC ([enzyme] = 2.5 nm) or 1.5 μm ApppBODIPY ([enzyme] = 1.2 nm), the first-order decay kinetics of ApppAMC and ApppBODIPY were examined. As shown in Fig.3 (A and B) and Table I, calculatedk cat/K m values for each substrate were 1.2 × 106 s−1m−1 and 2.3 × 106s−1m−1, respectively.Table IKinetic parameters with FhitCompoundk cat aFrom initial rate assays.

Open table in a new tab ApppBODIPY is an effective and useful substrate for Fhit with a quantitative disadvantage in cleavage (k cat/K m for ApppBODIPY = 2.3 × 106 s−1m−1 versus 3.8 × 107 s−1m−1 for ApppA (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). Initial rates as a function of ApppBODIPY concentration were measured and revealed that the basis for the catalytic disadvantage is in the k cat term. While theK m for ApppBODIPY, 3.0 μm, is less than 60% higher than that for ApppA, the k catfor ApppBODIPY, 7.3 s−1, is 10-fold lower than that for ApppA (Table I). Considering that ApppBODIPY is an ApppX-type compound, containing an unaltered adenylating functionality (11.Abend A. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3668-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is interesting to consider why the BODIPY substitution affectsk cat rather than K m. Retention of a low K m at the expense of reducedk cat could indicate that ApppBODIPY has multiple binding modes, only some of which are productive, or that ppBODIPY is not as good a leaving group as ADP. Thus, the 10-fold reduction ink cat might correspond to the reciprocal fraction of time ApppBODIPY is in a productive, ApppA-type conformation or a tendency of the ppBODIPY product to re-attack His-96-AMP rather than exiting the active site. Cleavage of ApppG by Fhit yielded a two-thirds mixture of AMP + GDP with a one-third mixture of GMP + ADP (3.Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W. Croce C.M. Ohta M. Huebner K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11529-11535Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Thus, the guanine in GpppBODIPY was expected to be an acceptable substitution for adenine in ApppBODIPY. Upon synthesis, GpppBODIPY was found to have only 11% of the fluorescence in aqueous solution of the parental dye. Because guanine does not absorb photons in the visible range, fluorescent resonance energy transfer was ruled out as the mechanism of quenching. In methanol, the yield of GpppBODIPY fluorescence rose to 60% that of BODIPY fluorescence, suggesting that a solvent-sensitive binding interaction between guanine and BODIPY is responsible for quenching. The NMR signal in D2O for the guanine C-8 proton was shifted from 8.2 ppm (GTP) to 7.9 ppm (GpppBODIPY), indicating that guanine is bound in the electron-rich BODIPY environment. No proton NMR shift or alteration of fluorescence was observed with ApppBODIPY. By analogy to fluorescent uridine nucleotide analogs (21.Dhar G. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14568-14572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we conclude that GpppBODIPY is quenched by stacking. The TLC assay of 2 μm GpppBODIPY ([enzyme] = 2.4 nm) in Figs. 2 C and 3 C shows that GpppBODIPY is within 4-fold as good a substrate as ApppBODIPY (k cat/K m = 5.8 × 105 s−1m−1 versus 2.3 × 106 s−1m−1) and that cleavage to ppBODIPY produces a 5.4-fold increase in fluorescence. The fluorogenic nature of GpppBODIPY allowed us to measure hydrolysis continuously or as stopped end points in a multiwell fluorescent plate reader. As shown in Table I, substitution of guanine for adenine reduces k cat10-fold while reducing K m 2-fold. In the crystal structure of Hint-GMP, the carbonyl oxygen of His-42 makes a buried hydrogen bond to the N-2 nitrogen of GMP (9.Brenner C. Garrison P. Gilmour J. Peisach D. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Lowenstein J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A similar interaction in Fhit could be positioning the GMP moiety of GpppBODIPY nonoptimally for catalysis and/or changing the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The readout of first-order ApppBODIPY assays,k cat/K m times enzyme concentration, is well suited for assays of competitive inhibitors. Competitive inhibitors rob from the pool of available enzyme, decreasingk cat/K m(apparent). The decrease ink cat/K m(apparent) is a function of the equilibrium binding constant and the concentration of the competitor. When the competing ligand is not a substrate, the equilibrium binding constant representsKI . When the competing ligand is itself a Fhit substrate, the equilibrium binding constant is K m, the apparent dissociation constant for all bound forms with enzyme. As shown in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table I, ApnA compounds, purine mononucleotides, inorganic pyrophosphate, and monophosphate were titrated into ApppBODIPY assays as competitive inhibitors. ApppA and AppppA displayed the lowest K m values. The K m for ApppA measured as a competing substrate was 2.0 ± 0.2 μm, consistent with the K m value measured for ApppA by 3H product formation, 1.9 ± 0.2 μm (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The additional phosphate group and two phosphate groups in AppppA and ApppppA increased K m by 30% and 600%, respectively. The next best competitor was inorganic pyrophosphate with a KI of 19.9 ± 3.8 μm. ATP and GTP, probably the most abundant cellular mononucleotides (26.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 54Google Scholar), were difficult to fit to Equation 1 (see “Experimental Procedures”), potentially because of formation of pyrophosphate. To estimate the K m values of ATP and GTP, the slowly hydrolyzed αS forms of these nucleotides (11.Abend A. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3668-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were examined. All purine mononucleotides tested hadKI and K m values approximately 10-fold higher than that of pyrophosphate. Monophosphate, on the other hand, inhibited with a KI of 2.9 ± 0.4 mm. To prove that the compounds inhibit competitively, rather than by a noncompetitive or uncompetitive mechanism, compounds were titrated into fluorogenic GpppBODIPY initial-rate assays over a range of substrate and inhibitor concentrations. As shown in Fig.5, ApppA, pyrophosphate, and AMP all increase the apparent K m of GpppBODIPY without affecting the k cat value, displaying the classical signature of competitive inhibitors in Eadie-Hofstee plots. These experiments also demonstrated that, much as the BODIPY for adenosine substitution was responsible for a 10-fold decrease ink cat with minimal effect onK m, the guanine for adenine substitution is responsible for a 10-fold decrease in k cat with minimal effect on K m. The new compounds described herein can be considered analogs of ATP and GTP as well as ApnA and have potential uses with a wide variety of enzymes including ATPases and GTPases. The compounds have been used to purify and characterize the Fhit active site of NitFhit, 3H. C. Pace, S. C. Hodawadekar, A. Draganescu, J. Huang, P. Bieganowski, Y. Pekarsky, C. M. Croce, and C. Brenner, manuscript in preparation. the Fhit ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans that is fused to Nit (27.Pekarsky Y. Campiglio M. Siprashvili Z. Druck T. Sedkov Y. Tillib S. Draganescu A. Wermuth P.

Brenner C. Guranowski A. Starzynska E. Blackburn G.M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1245-1247Google Scholar), a Fhit diagnostic kit can be developed for use in clinical laboratories. The GpppBODIPY assay for Fhit, as a 96-well fluorogenic assay, is also suitable for a high throughput screen for inhibitors. Among Fhit inhibitors, uncompetitive compounds (those that bind and retard the enzyme-substrate complex) might include compounds that are competitive with a Fhit effector (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The present study provides valuable information about properties of substrates and related compounds that determine binding to Fhit. Fhit-ApnA complexes may be required for signaling (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and formation of these complexes would have to occur in the face of competition with mononucleotides, monophosphate, pyrophosphate, and other compounds. The finding that reversible binding constants for ApnA, pyrophosphate, and purine mononucleotides are 2 E−6, 2 E−5, and 2 E−4 m, respectively, suggests that Fhit may have evolved a hierarchical system to avail itself of ApnA in the presence of competing compounds. Prior to our measurements of pyrophosphate and purine mononucleotides as competitive inhibitors of Fhit, one might have expected that the ground state of Fhit would be ATP-bound. Indeed, if purine mononucleotides are at low millimolar levels (26.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 54Google Scholar), 10 times their equilibrium-binding constants, ∼90% of Fhit would be occupied by mononucleotides in the absence of other competitors. The reported amount of inorganic pyrophosphate (1.33 × 10−16 mol, Ref. 29.Barshop B.A. Adamson D.T. Vellom D.C. Rosen F. Epstein B.L. Seegmiller J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) per lymphocyte (volume = 1.37 × 10−13liters, Ref. 30.Thompson C.B. Scher I. Schaefer M.E. Lindsten T. Finkelman F.D. Mond J.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 2333-2342PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the concentration of pyrophosphate (∼1 mm) exceeds the KI for pyrophosphate by 50-fold. Thus, Fhit may be primarily bound to pyrophosphate rather than ATP under low ApnA conditions. From the competition binding data presented in Table I, we calculate that a spike of ∼100 μm ApnA would convert half the Fhit-pyrophosphate to Fhit-ApnA. Conditions that lead to dramatic increases in ApnA levels include interferon (31.Vartanian A. Narovlyansky A. Amchenkova A. Turpaev K. Kisselev L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and etoposide (32.Vartanian A. Prudovsky I. Suzuki H. Dal Pra I. Kisselev L.

Pintor J. Miras-Portugal M.T. Soria B. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The data presented herein illustrate a surprising degree ofk cat discrimination among chemically similar substrates. Although the kinetics of Fhit-dependent cleavage of ApppA are robust, the function of Fhit appears to depend not on cleavage but binding ApnA substrates (5.Huebner K. Sozzi G. Brenner C. Pierotti M.A. Croce C.M. Adv. Oncol. 1999; 15: 3-10Google Scholar,6.Siprashvili Z. Sozzi G. Barnes L.D. McCue P. Robinson A.K. Eryomin V. Sard L. Tagliabue E. Greco A. Fusetti L. Schwartz G.

We have argued that important Fhit substrates are those with low K m values but not necessarily the highestk cat values. Less optimal substrates, such as AppppA, may be more important than ApppA if they are more abundant and if their residence time on Fhit is longer than that of ApppA (12.Pace H.C. Garrison P.N. Robinson A.K. Barnes L.D. Draganescu A. Rosler A. Blackburn G.M. Siprashvili Z. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Brenner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5484-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the cell, the lifetime of Fhit-substrate complexes may be stabilized by effector interactions. The observation that substrates with fundamentally unaltered chemical lability such as ApppBODIPY and GpppBODIPY are cleaved with reduced k catvalues suggests that Fhit has binding modes that are at least 100-fold stabilized with respect to optimized in vitro kinetics. The stereochemical course of the Fhit reaction (11.Abend A. Garrison P.N. Barnes L.D. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3668-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) dictates that ADP (in case of ApppA), ATP (in case of AppppA), or ppBODIPY (in case of fluorescent substrates) must leave before the hydrolytic water can be bound by the enzyme. Thus, any Fhit or Fhit-effector conformation that prevents leaving-group exit or blocks water entry would be expected to retard substrate hydrolysis. The 20 μmpyrophosphate-binding site that is competitive with substrate is a likely facilitator of leaving group-reattack. A Fhit effector may stabilize Fhit-ApnA by pinning the leaving group down on this site. Many intracellular and extracellular receptors are enzymatically inert, while others, such as GTPases, are slow enzymes with intrinsically long-lived enzyme-substrate complexes. Fhit appears to be a receptor for ApnA with rapid kinetics but with features that allow it to be stabilized in vivo. The kinetics and structural biology of Fhit-associated proteins (15.Chaudhuri A.R.

L., Gillespie, C. S., and Brophy, P. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 5794–5800). Here we show that L-periaxin is targeted to the nucleus of embryonic Schwann cells. Subsequently, the protein redistributes to the plasma membrane processes of the myelinating Schwann cell where it is believed to function in a signaling complex. In contrast, L-periaxin remains in the nucleus when expressed ectopically in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming glia of the central nervous system. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) is basic and tripartite and comprises three signals that act synergistically. Nuclear targeting of L-periaxin is energy-dependent and is inhibited by cell-cell contact. These data show that L-periaxin is a member of a growing family of proteins that can shuttle between the nucleus and cortical signaling/adherence complexes."

It represents the common signal transducing receptor component of the so called interleukin-6-type cytokines. For several cytokine receptors including gp130 it has been shown that receptor activation cannot only be achieved by the natural ligand but also by single monoclonal antibodies raised against the receptor ectodomain. These findings have been interpreted in a way that dimerization of cytokine receptors is sufficient for receptor activation. Here we show that the recently described gp130-activating antibody B-S12 actually consists of two different monoclonal antibodies. By subcloning of B-S12 the monoclonal antibodies B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7 were obtained. The individual antibodies are biologically inactive, in combination they exert B-S12-like activity on hepatoma cells. On Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with gp130 a combination of B-S12-G7 with another monoclonal gp130 antibody, B-P8, is required to stimulate proliferation. Using gp130 deletion mutants we show that all three antibodies map to domains 2 and 3 of gp130 which constitute the cytokine binding module. The individual antibodies inhibit activation of the signal transducer by interleukin-6 and interfere with binding of interleukin-6 to gp130. Interestingly, the combination of B-S12-G7 and a Fab fragment of B-P8 retains biological activity. We conclude from our data that (i) the monoclonal antibodies activate gp130 by mimicking the natural ligand and (ii) enforcement of gp130 dimerization is not sufficient for receptor activation but additional conformational requirements have to be fulfilled.

A central mode of communication is the release of mediators by one cell that are recognized specifically by the cognate receptors on the plasma membrane of target cells. Receptors act like a kind of molecular switches that respond to ligand binding with the triggering of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways. These signaling cascades often target to nuclear DNA leading to specific cellular responses like growth, differentiation, or even apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of receptor activation by the ligand depends on the type of receptor involved. The commonly accepted activation mechanism for most receptors spanning the membrane only once is ligand-induced receptor dimerization (1.Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem.

Important receptors sharing this feature belong to the families of receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. The type I transmembrane glycoprotein gp130 is a cytokine receptor that represents the common signal transducing receptor component of the IL-61-type cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1. IL-6-type cytokines are not only involved in the regulation of immune responses or hematopoiesis as the definition of cytokines suggests but are also required for female fertility, heart development, and several other important physiological processes (for review, see Ref. 3.Heinrich P.C.

These α-receptors can functionally be replaced by their soluble forms since they do not contribute to signal transduction (13.Taga T. Hibi M. Hirata Y. Yamasaki K. Yasukawa K. Matsuda T. Hirano T.

Responsiveness of cells to IL-6-type cytokines is tightly regulated by the more restricted expression of IL-6R, IL-11R, CNTFR, LIFR, and OSMR (3.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of gp130 is proposed to consist of an N-terminal Ig-like domain followed by a cytokine-binding module (CBM) and three fibronectin type III-like domains (14.Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The CBM is the hallmark of class I cytokine receptors and consists of two fibronectin type III-like domains that show as conserved features a distinct pattern of cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain and a WSXWS motif in the C-terminal domain (16.Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The structures of the CBM constituting domains 2 and 3 of gp130 have recently been solved (17.Bravo J. Staunton D. Heath J.K. Jones E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1665-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Kernebeck T. Pflanz S. Müller-Newen G. Kurapkat G. Scheek R.M. Dijkstra K. Heinrich P.C. Wollmer A. Grzesiek S. Grötzinger J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1-8Google Scholar). The Ig-like domain and the CBM of gp130 are required and sufficient to bind IL-6·IL-6R- as well as IL-11·IL-11R complexes (19.Horsten U. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Müllberg J. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20.Kurth I. Horsten U. Pflanz S. Dahmen H. Küster A. Grötzinger J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1480-1487PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison to the ectodomains of other cytokine receptors such as EpoR, IL-2R, IL-4R, or GHR that only consist of a single CBM (for review, see Ref. 21.Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the architecture of gp130 is relatively complex. The functional relevance of its structural features are not fully understood. Activation of gp130 by IL-6-type cytokines triggers several cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades from which the Jak/STAT pathway is understood in greatest detail. After cytokine binding Jak kinases that are constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic tail of gp130 are activated and subsequently phosphorylate tyrosine residues of gp130. These phosphotyrosine side chains serve as docking sites for latent transcription factors of the STAT family, mainly STAT3. Upon phosphorylation the STATs dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and induce IL-6-type cytokine target genes (22.Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M. Yuan J. Buschmann J. Schindler C. Ziemiecki A. Harpur A.G. Wilks A.F. Yasukawa K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 23.Stahl N.

Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, it is believed that IL-6 and IL-11, bound to their respective α-receptors, trigger dimerization of gp130 and that receptor dimerization is sufficient to launch signal transduction (4.Murakami M.

The fact that several cytokine receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases can be activated by monoclonal antibodies has been interpreted to support the hypothesis that receptor dimerization is sufficient for receptor activation (25.Ballinger M.D. Wells J.A. Nature Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 938-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study we show that efficient activation of gp130 requires the simultaneous action of two monoclonal antibodies and provide evidence that the mechanism of gp130 activation goes beyond simple receptor dimerization.

The digestion was stopped by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm). 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and after incubation for 12 h at 4 °C the supernatant was used for further studies. Fab fragments prepared were analyzed by gel filtration.

After 72 h of incubation, viable and metabolically active cells were quantified using a colorimetric assay based on the Cell Proliferation Kit II, XTT (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany).Figure 4Inhibitory activities of monoclonal antibodies. A, Ba/F3-gp130 cells were stimulated with IL-6 (5 ng/ml) and sIL-6R (1 μg/ml) in the presence of varying amounts (50–0.024 μg/ml; 333–0.16 nm) of the antibodies B-P8, B-S12-G7, B-S12-A5, B-R3, or B-K11. After 72 h a tetrazolium compound was added as a substrate and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the absorbance at 450 and 690 nm was measured. The difference of absorbances corresponds to the number of metabolically active cells (XTT proliferation assay). 100% correspond to proliferation in the absence of antibody. ■, B-P8; ○, B-S12-G7; Δ, B-S12-A5; *, B-R3; ×, B-K11.

Aliquots were transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate precoated with the gp130 mAb B-P4. After several washing steps avidin conjugated to peroxidase was added. Binding of avidin-peroxidase to bsIL-6R was detected by the conversion of a chromogenic substrate that was measured as an increase of absorbance at 450 nm.

Subsequently, cells were incubated on ice with 4 μg/ml gp130 antibodies or Fab fragments, respectively. Cells were washed with cold PBS/azide and incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment at a 1:50 dilution. Again, cells were washed with cold PBS/azide and then resuspended in 400 μl of PBS/azide followed by flow cytometry analysis using a FACScalibur (Beckton Dickinson). To analyze ternary complex formation in the presence of different antibodies, IL-6 (400 ng/ml) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with biotinylated sIL-6R (12.5 ng/ml), sgp130 (25 ng/ml), and various amounts of antibodies (see Fig. 4, B and C) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. 96-Well microtiter plates (F96 MaxiSorp immunoplate, Nunc) were coated overnight at room temperature with the monoclonal gp130 antibody B-P4 (0.5 μg/well in PBS). The plates were incubated with saturation buffer (0.1 m Tris, 20% sucrose, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.7) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, 0.02% Tween 20 was added to the samples and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently the plates were washed again and streptavidin poly-horseradish peroxidase (100 ng/ml in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After a final wash, substrate solution (100 μg/ml tetramethylbenzidine in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and 0.003% H2O2) was added. After incubation for 30 min the color reaction was stopped with 2m H2SO4 and the absorbance at 450 nm determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (SLT-Labinstruments, Austria). In previous studies several monoclonal antibodies (mAb) raised against the ectodomain of gp130 have been characterized in respect to their antagonistic or agonistic activities. Among these B-S12 has been described to be a potent agonist exerting IL-6-type cytokine-like responses on cells expressing gp130 (24.Fourcin M. Chevalier S. Guillet C. Robledo O. Froger J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11756-11760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29.Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Zong-Jiang G. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The mAb B-P8 acted synergistically by supporting the agonistic activity of B-S12. In an epitope competition assay we found that B-S12 displaced B-P8, but B-P8 even at high concentrations did not displace B-S12 (29.Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Müller-Newen G. Roche C. Zong-Jiang G. Clement C. Klein B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3474-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using a similar assay Autissier et al. (35.Autissier P. Liautard J. Brochier J. Gaillard J.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that B-S12 recognizes two different epitopes and therefore may be a mixture of two antibodies. These observations prompted us to re-examine the nature of B-S12. After application of small amounts of B-P8 or B-S12 (0.5 μg) to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions the heavy chain and light chain of B-P8 appear as single bands (Fig.1 A, lane 1) whereas the heavy chain of B-S12 appears as a double band of two species of slightly different molecular masses (lane 2). After application of a larger amount of B-S12 also the light chain is clearly visible as a double band of two species showing a more pronounced difference in electrophoretic mobilities (lane 3). After deglycosylation of the antibodies, the heavy chains shift to lower molecular masses but the double band remains suggesting that the two species are not due to differential glycosylation of the B-S12 heavy chain (not shown). These data suggest that B-S12 may indeed represent a mixture of two mAb. Therefore, the B-S12 secreting hybridoma cells were subcloned and the antibodies produced by the individual clones were analyzed. The resulting antibodies can be divided into two groups due to their appearance in SDS-PAGE. In Fig. 1 B two representatives of each group are shown (B-S12-A5/B-S12-A9 and B-S12-A12/B-S12-G7, respectively). The electrophoretic mobilities of the heavy and light chains of the individual antibodies when compared with B-S12 indicate that the agonistic antibody previously described is a mixture of two monoclonal antibodies. For further studies one antibody of each group was chosen, namely B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7. To analyze the biological activities of the individual antibodies, HepG2 human hepatoma cells that respond to IL-6-type cytokine stimulation with the production of acute phase proteins were used. HepG2 cells were incubated at different concentrations with single gp130 mAb or a combination of two antibodies. Incubation of HepG2 cells with B-S12 leads to the induction of synthesis of the acute phase protein α1-antichymotrypsin that is indistinguishable from stimulation by IL-6 (Fig.2 A). Even at high concentrations (up to 50 μg/ml) neither B-P8 alone nor the B-S12 constituting antibodies B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7 alone induce prominent activation of α1-antichymotrypsin synthesis. The combination of B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7, however, exerts B-S12-like activity. These findings suggest that two antibodies are required for activation of gp130. Interestingly, the combination of B-P8 and B-S12-G7 was biologically active as well whereas the combination of B-P8 and B-S12-A5 was completely inactive indicating that gp130 is not activated by any combination of two antibodies. Activation of gp130 by IL-6-type cytokines leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and to a lesser extent STAT1. Upon phosphorylation the STATs homo- or heterodimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to enhancers of IL-6-type cytokine target genes. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay presented in Fig. 2 B shows that STAT activation in response to stimulation of gp130 with monoclonal antibodies also requires the specific action of two monoclonal antibodies. Neither B-P8 nor B-S12-A5 nor B-S12-G7 alone led to any significant activation of STAT3 or STAT1 in HepG2 cells. Again the combination of B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7 (that constitute B-S12) and the combination of B-S12-G7 and B-P8 is biologically active whereas the combination of B-S12-A5 and B-P8 failed to induce STAT activation. Combination of B-S12-G7 with another gp130 mAb (B-K11) did not lead to STAT activation indicating that not any pair of gp130 mAb comprising B-S12-G7 is able to activate gp130. To confirm the biological activities of the antibody combinations, another cellular response to activation of gp130 was studied. Ba/F3 cells stably transfected with gp130 (Ba/F3-gp130 (34.Horsten U. Müller-Newen G. Gerhartz C. Wollmer A. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C. Grötzinger J. J. Biol.

Ba/F3-gp130 cells were incubated with IL-6 and sIL-6R or with different combinations of antibodies and subsequently cell proliferation was measured. Any antibody or antibody combination that was inactive on HepG2 cells also failed to stimulate growth of Ba/F3-gp130 cells (Fig.3 A). Surprisingly, even at high concentrations (up to 333 nm) neither B-S12 (not shown) nor a combination of B-S12-A5 and B-S12-G7 efficiently stimulated growth of Ba/F3-gp130 cells (Fig. 3 A) although these antibodies acted agonistically on HepG2 cells. On the other hand, the combination of B-S12-G7 and B-P8 acte"

In experiments with the human carcinoma A431 cell line, we have previously described miniature Ca2+ channels (I min), which are activated by application of uridine trisphosphate and bradykinin to cell-attached patches or by application of InsP3 to excised inside-out patches (6.Mozhayeva G.N.

Major functional properties of I minchannels, such as small conductance (1 picosiemens for divalent cations), high selectivity for divalent cations (P Ca/K > 1,000), inward rectification, and sensitivity to block by SKF95365 are very similar to properties ofI CRAC channels (8.Kiselyov K.I.

Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 2.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 3.Putney Jr., J.W. McKay R.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), with attention in the field primarily focused on two major hypotheses. In the first scenario,I CRAC is activated by a “diffusible messenger” released by depleted Ca2+ stores (13.Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the second scenario, I CRAC is activated via a direct mechanical connection with the intracellular InsP3R via a “conformational coupling” mechanism (1.Berridge M.J. Biochem.

Evidence for a “conformational coupling” model comes from the highly compartmentalized connection between InsP3-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx processes (15.Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J.

InsP3R located just underneath the plasma membrane must exist in cells to support formation of InsP3R-I min complexes. It has been recently proposed that a subpopulation of intracellular InsP3R forms tight complexes with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the plasma membrane (23.Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Can the same InsP3R interact with both Imin and PIP2? Can theI min-InsP3R-PIP2 complex mediate signal transduction? To answer these questions, here we tested the effects of monoclonal anti-PIP2 antibody (PIP2Ab) (24.Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and exogenous PIP2 onI min activity in patches excised from A431 cells. We found that PIP2Ab activated and exogenous PIP2 inhibited I min activity. Based on these results, we propose a novelI min-InsP3R-PIP2functional coupling model. Human carcinoma A431 cells (Cell Culture Collection, Institute of Cytology, St. Petersburg, Russia) were kept in culture as described elsewhere (8.Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For patch clamp experiments, cells were seeded onto coverslips and maintained in culture for 1–3 days before use. Single-channel currents were recorded using the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique (25.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15065) Google Scholar). Currents filtered at 500 Hz were recorded using a PC-501A patch clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments, USA) with a conventional feedback resistance in the head stage (10 gigaohms). During recording, the currents were digitized at 2.5 kHz. For data analysis and presentation, currents were additionally digitally filtered as indicated. Imin open probability (NP o) was determined using the following equation: NP o = <I>/i where <I> and iare the mean channel current and unitary current amplitude, respectively. <I> was estimated from the time integral of the current above the base line, and i was determined from current records and all-point amplitude histograms. Data were collected from 20-s current records after channel activity reached steady state. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were performed at standard conditions optimal for I Ca activity at −70 mV holding potential. The pipette solution contained 105 mmBaCl2 and 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). The standard intracellular solution contained 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, 1.13 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm EGTA (pCa 7, pH 7.4). Experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C). PIP2Ab (24.Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was from PerSeptive Biosystems. PIP2Ab was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (titer 1:1500), diluted 1:100 by intracellular solution, and used for chamber perfusion. Stearoyl-arachidonyl 4,5-PIP2was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PIP2 vesicles were prepared as described previously (23.Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and applied to the patch at the 10 μm final concentration by rapid bath perfusion. 4–4-bromophenacylbromide and HEPES were from Sigma; EGTA was from Fluka Chemie AG (Buchs, Switzerland). InsP3 and U73122 were from Calbiochem. In inside-out patches excised from the plasma membrane of human carcinoma A431 cells, the application of 5 μm InsP3 to the cytoplasmic side of the patch in approximately 50% of experiments induced activation of I min (Fig.1 A). At 5 μmInsP3, Imin activity in excised patches was transient due to InsP3-dependent inactivation (8.Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and channel activity rapidly subsided (Fig. 1, A andB). We found that I min activity can be restored and further enchanced by the application of PIP2Ab (24.Fukami K. Matsuoka K. Nakanishi O. Yamakawa A. Kawai S. Takenawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9057-9061Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) to the cytosolic side of the patch membrane (Fig. 1, A and B). PIP2Ab activated Imin in all experiments (11 of 11), and, on average, increased channel NP o in the presence of 2.5 μm InsP3 from 0.8 ± 0.2 (n = 13) to 3.0 ± 0.2 (n = 7). The addition of boiled PIP2Ab had no effect onI min (n = 5). By reversing the order of InsP3 and PIP2Ab additions to the patch, we established that InsP3 was absolutely required to register channel activity (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, current-voltage relationship and voltage-dependence of channels observed in the presence of PIP2Ab and InsP3were indistinguishable from the corresponding properties ofI min channels recorded in the presence of InsP3 alone (Fig. 1, D and E). To gain insight into the mechanism of PIP2Ab action, we characterized the effect of PIP2Ab onI min sensitivity to activation by InsP3. In this series of experiments, we determined the mean NP o of I min in inside-out patches as a function of InsP3 concentration. Fit to the data obtained in control conditions (Fig.2, filled circles) yielded apparent affinity (K app) of 0.51 μm InsP3, maximal NPo( NPomax) of 0.87 and a Hill coefficient (n H) of 1.05 (curve). In contrast, fit to the data obtained in the presence of PIP2Ab (Fig. 2, open circles) resulted in K app of 0.08 μmInsP3, NPomax of 3.21, and n H of 0.8 (curve). Thus, on average, PIP2Ab induced a greater than 6-fold change inI min apparent affinity for InsP3 and a 3.7-fold change in NPomax. PIP2Ab did not activate I min in the absence of InsP3 (Fig. 1 C) but instead dramatically increased the potency of InsP3 to activateI min (Fig. 2). PIP2Ab acts by specifically chelating PIP2(24). The addition of exogenous PIP2 is expected to have an effect opposite to that of PIP2Ab. Indeed, the addition of PIP2 vesicles to the cytosolic surface of inside-out patches inhibited InsP3-activatedI min (Fig.3 A) (15 of 18) and shifted InsP3 dose-dependence curve toward lower apparent affinity for InsP3 (Fig. 2, triangles). The inhibitory influence of PIP2 could be partially overcome by raising InsP3 concentration to 20 μm (Figs. 2 and3 A). The addition of high InsP3 concentrations prior to PIP2 was not possible due to InsP3-induced desensitization ofI min (8.Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An ability of PIP2 to inhibit I min was not significantly affected by phospholipase A2 inhibitor 4-bromophenacylbromide (Fig.3 B) (9 of 13) or phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (Fig.3 C) (4 of 4). Thus, it is unlikely that exogenous PIP2 needs to be converted to arachidonic acid (8.Kiselyov K.I. Semyonova S.B. Mamin A.G. Mozhayeva G.N. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 437: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or diacylglycerol to inhibit Imin. Moreover, diacylglycerol had no inhibitory effect on I min activity (6 of 6) (data not shown). Activation of I min by PIP2Ab in inside-out patches (Fig. 1), a dramatic shift inI min InsP3 dose dependence induced by PIP2Ab (Fig. 2), and the ability of PIP2 to exert the opposite effects (Fig. 3) are all highly reminiscent of recently described effects of PIP2Ab and PIP2on intracellular InsP3R (23.Lupu V.D.

We recently demonstrated direct I min-InsP3R functional coupling (12.Zubov A.I. Kaznacheyeva E.V. Nikolaev A.V. Alexeenko V.A. Kiselyov K. Muallem S. Mozhayeva G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25983-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The data described in the present report can be explained under the assumption that the I min in A431 cells are directly coupled to InsP3R-PIP2complexes proposed to exist underneath the plasma membrane (Fig.4 A). It is generally believed that inside-out patch is not a bare bilayer but rather a membrane-covered bleb of cytoplasm (26.Ruknudin A. Song M.J. Sachs F. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that may include InsP3R-containing organelles and cytoskeleton. We reason that PIP2Ab and PIP2 exert an influence on InsP3R as described previously (23.Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); change in InsP3R conformation is in turn transmitted to changes inI min behavior via the conformation coupling mechanism (1.Berridge M.J.

Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cleavage of InsP3R-tethered PIP2 has been previously proposed to lead to localized Ca2+ release from the “trigger” stores and Ca2+ wave initiation (23.Lupu V.D. Kaznacheyeva E. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14067-14070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). “On-site” conversion of PIP2 into InsP3should induce large scale conformational changes of the InsP3R-N domain (27.Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Conformational change of the InsP3R-N domain, which plays an organizing role inI min-InsP3R-PIP2 complex formation, leads to opening of the InsP3R channel gate and to activation of I min via direct protein-protein interaction (Fig. 4 B). Indeed, only InsP3-ligated InsP3R-N is able to evoke humantrp3 channel activity (21.Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), in general agreement with our model. The proposed model also agrees with much of experimental evidence supporting a highly compartmentalized connection between InsP3-induced Ca2+ release and Ca2+influx (15.Paradiso A.M. Mason S.J. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16.Petersen C.C. Berridge M.J.

Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The proposed coupling model (Fig. 4) implies that InsP3R is essential for capacitative Ca2+ entry channel activation. The removal of all three InsP3R isoforms by genetic means in chicken B lymphocytes had no effect on thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx (28.Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), apparently in direct conflict with the conformational coupling model. The existence of at least one more Ca2+ influx pathway in nonexcitable cells can potentially account for these results. This additional pathway may be stimulated by the global intracellular Ca2+ store depletion and does not require InsP3R for activation. Additional studies are needed to clarify which channel type is responsible for an InsP3R-independent Ca2+ influx in nonexcitable cells."

The primary structure of the peptide was established by a combination of microsequencing, mass spectroscopy and site-directed antiserum immunoreactivity as SDEEVQVPGGVISNGYFLFRPRN-amide (Mr 2580.6). A synthetic replicate of frog NmU-23 displaced monoradioiodinated rat NmU-23 from uterine membranes in a dose-dependent fashion indistinguishable from nonisotopically labeled rat NmU-23. In a rat uterine smooth muscle strip preparation, synthetic frog NmU-23 produced dose-dependent contractions identical to porcine NmU-25. However, in a preparation of human urinary bladder muscle strip, the synthetic frog peptide was more potent than porcine NmU-25 in eliciting contraction and produced desensitization of the preparation to the latter peptide. This report demonstrates that the defensive skin secretion of a frog contains a novel peptide exhibiting a high degree of primary structural similarity to the endogenous vertebrate peptide, NmU, and that this frog skin analog displays biological activity in mammalian tissues.

Melchiorri P. Falconieri Erspamer G.F. Montecucchi P.P. De Castiglione R. Peptides. 1985; 6 Suppl. 3: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Currently, in excess of 100 peptides have been structurally characterized, and these have been classified into several families based upon primary structural similarities (2.Lazarus L.H. Attila M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 473-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Many of these peptides have primary structures that are either identical to their endogenous mammalian counterparts (e.g.bradykinin from the skin of the European common frog, Rana temporaria (3.Anastasi A. Erspamer V. Bertaccini G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1965; 14: 43-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or possess discrete regions of identity with the active sites of such (e.g. bombesin from the skin of the European frog, Bombina bombina (4.Anastasi A. Erspamer V. Bucci M. Experientia (Basel). 1971; 27: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar)). A number of approaches have been adopted to identify and isolate bioactive peptides from amphibian skin on the basis of physiological tests or bioassay. For example, contractile activity of smooth muscle preparations has enabled several peptides to be identified from a large number of amphibian species (5.Erspamer V. Erspamer G.F. Mazzanti G. Endean R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1984; 71: 99-108Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6.Erspamer V. Erspamer G.F. Cei J.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Chartrel N. Vaudry H. Nicolas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10295-10299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The glandular secretion of the green tree frog, Litoria caerulea, found in the northern territories of Australia and in New Guinea, is known to contain large quantities of peptides, only a few of which have been structurally characterized. These include a group of homologous peptides, the caerins (11.Stone D.J.M. Waugh R.J. Bowie J.H. Wallace J.C. Tyler M.J. J. Chem. Res. 1993; 4: 138Google Scholar), certain of which have antibacterial and antiviral properties (12.Stone D.J.M. Bowie J.H. Wallace J.C. Tyler M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1992; 17: 1224-1225Crossref Google Scholar); the caeridins, whose bioactivity is unknown (13.Waugh R.J. Stone D.J.M. Bowie J.H. Wallace J.C. Tyler M.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993; 5: 73-76Google Scholar); and caerulein, with physiological effects indistinguishable from CCK-8 (14.Anastasi A. Erspamer V. Endean R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 125: 57-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To date, the identity of other peptides within the skin secretion remains to be established. The neuromedin U (NmU)1 group of peptides exhibit limited sequence similarity with other peptide families. The prototype peptides, NmU-8 and NmU-25, the former representing the C-terminal octapeptide amide of the latter, were isolated from extracts of porcine spinal cord tissues (15.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and both were found to be myoactive. NmU immunoreactivity has been found throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems, with the highest concentrations in the pituitary gland, gastrointestinal tract, and nucleus accumbens (16.Nandha K.A. Bloom S.R. Biomed. Res. Tokyo. 1993; 14: 71-76Google Scholar). Primary structural information currently exists on six other members of this peptide family from the rat (17.Conlon J.M. Domin J.

Pept. 1992; 41: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The primary structure of a putative human NmU-25 has been deduced from cDNA encoding the human NmU precursor (24.Austin C. Lo G. Nandha K.A. Meleagros L. Bloom S.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). NmU peptides have been shown to be potent stimulators of uterine smooth muscle contractionin vitro (15.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A variety of motor responses have been reported to be mediated by NmU in the gastrointestinal tract of several different species (28.Brown D.R. Quito Eur. J.

NmU may also exert a direct and indirect effect on the regulation of growth, structure, and function of the adrenal cortex (31.Malendowicz L.K. Andeis P.G. Markowska A. Nowak M. Warchol J.B. Neri G.

We report here, for the first time, the isolation and structural characterization of a 23-amino acid residue NmU analog from the defensive skin secretion of an amphibian. We further demonstrate that a synthetic replicate of this peptide is biologically active in smooth muscle tissues of rat and man and that it can effectively compete with its endogenous mammalian counterparts for specific high affinity binding sites on membrane preparations from such tissues. Synthetic NmU-8 and NmU-25 and Lys0-NmU-8 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (St. Helens, United Kingdom); NmU-8 tracer was monoradioiodinated within our laboratory. Carbamylcholine chloride (Carbachol) was supplied by Sigma (Dorset, UK). All other reagents were of analytical or HPLC grade. Guinea pigs were immunized with porcine Lys0-NmU-8 conjugated to ovalbumin using glutaraldehyde. Animals were given primary subcutaneous immunizations of 50 μg of coupled peptide dispersed in 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant and monthly boosters of 10 μg of coupled peptide dispersed in 1 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. After two booster injections, an antiserum with appropriate affinity for radioimmunoassay was obtained. All of the reactants for the NmU radioimmunoassay were diluted in 0.04 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.14 m sodium chloride and 2% (v/v) horse serum. The assay system consisted of 100 μl of diluted NmU-8 antiserum (reference code GP 9320 (1:38,000)), 100 μl of monoradioiodinated NmU-8 tracer (100 Bq, 2 pg), and 100 μl of porcine NmU-8 standard (0–500 pg/assay tube) or sample. Antiserum and NmU-8 standards (or samples) were incubated for 24 h at 4 °C, with further incubation of the assay system for 24 h at 4 °C following the addition of monoradioiodinated NmU-8 tracer. Separation of bound from free counts was achieved by the addition of 1 ml of 0.05% (w/v) dextran-coated charcoal, followed by centrifugation at 1100 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Charcoal pellets, containing free counts, were counted using a Nuclear Enterprises NE 1600 γ-counter. Under these conditions, the sensitivity of the assay was 1.5 pg of NmU-8/assay tube. Cross-reactivity of the antiserum with substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, pancreatic polypeptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, neuropeptide tyrosine, peptide tyrosine tyrosine, and neuropeptide phenylalanine was assessed. Young adult, captive bred specimens (n = 4, snout to vent length of 8 cm) ofL. caerulea were obtained from a local supplier. The frogs were maintained in terraria at a temperature of 24 °C with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle and were fed crickets twice weekly. Following a 4-week period of acclimatization, skin secretions were obtained from the frogs by gentle electrical stimulation (4-ms pulse width, 50 Hz, 5 V) using platinum electrodes placed over the paired parotoid glands. Secretions were visible after a few seconds, and these were washed into a glass beaker with deionized water. The resultant secretions were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen prior to lyophilization. Approximately 50 mg, dry weight, of skin secretion could be obtained from the four frogs on a monthly basis without obvious deleterious effects on the frogs over a period of 2 years. Lyophilized skin secretions (approximately 50 mg, dry weight) were reconstituted in 3 ml of 2m acetic acid and applied to a precalibrated 90 × 1.6-cm chromatographic column packed with Sephadex G50 (medium) gel, equilibrated in 2 m acetic acid. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 10 ml/h, and 2.5-ml fractions were collected. NmU immunoreactive gel permeation chromatographic fractions were pooled and fractionated by reverse phase HPLC using a 30 × 1-cm Vydac C18 column and a Waters system: mobile phase A, trifluoroacetic acid/water (0.1:99.9, v/v); mobile phase B, trifluoroacetic acid/water/acetonitrile (0.1:19.9:80.0, v/v/v); linear gradient 0–80% B in 80 min, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Following screening by radioimmunoassay, immunoreactive peptides were purified using a (25 × 0.46-cm) Vydac diphenyl column and a (15 × 0.46-cm) Kromasil C18 column: mobile phase A, trifluoroacetic acid/water (0.1:99.9, v/v); mobile phase B, trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (0.1:99.9, v/v); linear gradients were used, as indicated, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The purified NmU immunoreactive peptide was subjected to automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise 491 microsequencer. The limit for detection of phenylthiohydantoin amino acids was 0.2 pmol. The correct mass of the purified peptide was verified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) on a linear time-of-flight Biflex mass spectrometer (Bruker Instruments), with a positive detection mode and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Internal mass calibration of the instrument with known standards established the accuracy of mass determination as ±0.1%. Frog NmU-23 was synthesized automatically by the solid-phase method using standard Fmoc chemistry on 0.5–1.0 g of TentaGel S RAM resin (0.22 mmol/g; Rapp Polymere, Tübingen). Couplings were carried out with 4–8 eq of Fmoc-amino acid derivatives at ambient temperature. After final cleavage, crude peptides were purified by preparative HPLC using a 250 × 20-mm PolyEncap A300 column (Bischoff Analysentechnik GmbH, Leonberg) and a Shimadzu LC-8A system: mobile phase A, trifluoroacetic acid/water (0.1:99.9, v/v); mobile phase B, trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile/water (0.1/50.0/49.9, v/v/v); linear gradient 50–90% B in 70 min, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The correct mass of the purified peptide was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry on a linear time-of-flight MALDI II mass spectrometer (Kratos, Manchester, UK) using the positive detection mode and a sinapinic acid matrix. The spectra were obtained by summing over 50 laser pulses (337 nm). The [M + H]+ peak of bovine insulin (m/z 5735) was used for internal mass calibration. Virgin female Wistar rats (200–250 g) were killed by cervical dislocation, and both uterine horns were removed en bloc and placed in ice-cold De Jalon solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.95 mm NaHCO3, 5.63 mm KCl, 0.54 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 2.78 mm glucose) equilibrated with a carbogen mixture (95% O2, 5% CO2). Each uterine horn was halved, mounted in a 2-ml organ bath containing De Jalon solution, and maintained at 30 °C. NmU-8, NmU-25, and frog NmU-23 were dissolved in fresh De Jalon solution each day and added directly to the bath. Contractions were measured isometrically using UFI force displacement transducers (Pioden Controls Ltd., Canterbury, UK). Concentration response curves were constructed by the addition of a single concentration of an agonist, followed by two 5-min washes of the tissue subsequent to a maximum contraction being achieved; the process was then repeated with a higher concentration of the agonist. Tissue responses were normalized by expression in grams of tension produced per milligram of tissue (wet weight) (g/mg). Drug potencies were expressed as EC50values, determined by the method of De Lean et al. (34.De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results were expressed as mean values ± S.E., and significance (p value < 0.05) was tested using analysis of variance. Full thickness specimens were taken from the dome of the bladder from two cadaver donors (with consent) and immediately placed in ice-cold Krebs solution (120 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 15.4 mmNaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl, 11.5 mm glucose) previously equilibrated with a carbogen mixture (97% O2, 3% CO2) to give a stable pH of 7.4. Muscle strips (two 2 × 10-mm strips) comprising parallel muscle bundles were dissected from the specimen using a dissection microscope and fine silk (5/0) ligatures tied to each end of the strips. Strips were mounted in 2-ml organ baths containing Krebs solution and maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with constant bubbling (97% O2, 3% CO2). After an initial application of 1 g of tension, tissue was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h, during which time the bath was constantly perfused with Krebs solution (37 °C at 1 ml/min). Strips were initially challenged with carbachol (100 μm) in order to test the integrity of the muscle and obtain a measure of the maximum contraction. NmU-8, NmU-25, and frog NmU-23 were dissolved fresh each day in Krebs solution and added directly to the bath. Agonists were applied in a noncumulative manner; however, after exposure to an agonist, the organ bath was drained and washed (2 × 5 min) as described above before being perfused at 1 ml/min with fresh, gas-equilibrated Krebs (37 °C) for 20 min. Measurement of contraction was performed as described above. Female Wistar rats were killed by asphyxiation in CO2, and the uteri were rapidly dissected and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Uterus membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation, as described previously (35.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Membranes were resuspended in ice-cold HEPES (50 mm) buffer (pH 7.6) containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (0.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), antipain (0.5 μg/ml), benzamidine (0.1 μg/ml), aprotinin (30 μg/ml), and bacitracin (0.1 μg/ml) to a final concentration of approximately 10 mg of protein/ml and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Biuret method (36.Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic rat-NmU-23 was iodinated by the chloramine T method as described previously (35.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peak fractions were assayed for binding to uterine membranes, and the average specific activity, as determined by a specific NmU radioimmunoassay (37.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S. Peptides. 1987; 8: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was 24 Bq/fmol. The assay was performed as described by Nandha et al. (35.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, incubations were carried out at 4 °C for 60 min in a final volume of 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and aprotinin (30 μg/ml). The presence of constant amounts of membrane protein (200 μg/ml) and radiolabeled peptide (2000 Bq; 0.17 nm) with the concentration of the unlabeled synthetic peptide varied from 0 to 1 μm. The receptor-[125I]rat NmU complex was separated from free tracer by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 2 min. The pellet was washed once with ice-cold binding buffer (0.5 ml) and counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled rat NmU-23. Specific binding is defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression to determine the affinity (K D) of binding sites using Receptor-Fit programs (Lundon Software, Cleveland, OH). NmU immunoreactivity was detected in the gel permeation chromatographic fractions of lyophilized L. caerulea skin secretion eluting in fractions suggestive of a molecular mass of less than 3 kDa (data not shown). Radioimmunoassay indicated the presence of a least 4.5 nmol of NmU immunoreactive peptide in the sample. Following semipreparative HPLC fractionation of 50% of the pooled NmU immunoreactive gel permeation chromatographic fractions, immunoreactivity was localized to a single peak spanning three fractions (Fig. 1 A). Further purification of these fractions by diphenyl reverse phase HPLC produced a single symmetrical peak of UV absorbance coincident with NmU immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, B and C). This purified peptide was subjected to structural analysis. The primary structure of the purified peptide was established unequivocally as SDEEVQVPGGVISNGYFLFRPRN, and the observed mass of 2580.6 Da corresponded precisely with the theoretically predicted mass of the peptide with an amidated C-terminal residue (2580.8 Da). The full molar cross-reactivity of the frog NmU-23 with the amide requiring NmU antiserum employed in a radioimmunoassay confirmed the presence of this common post-translational modification. Sequence alignment of the newly identified peptide with those of the Swiss-Prot and GenBankTM peptide/protein sequence data bases revealed a very high degree of sequence similarity with peptides of the NmU family (Table I). Approximately 87% of the NmU immunoreactivity applied to the original chromatographic column was purified to homogeneity.Table IA comparison of the primary structures of NmU peptides from different speciesSpeciesSequencea*, gaps have been introduced in the sequence to maximize homology: _, identical residues.Frog skin NmUSDEEVQVPGGVISNGYFLFRPRN-NH2Frog (gut)LKP___L_G____L_R___V_____RabbitFPV___F_S_F_SR_R_________HumanFRV___F_S_F_SR_R_________RatYKVN_*Y_G_*_AP_G_F_______ChickenYKV__DL_GA__IQ_R___F_____PigFKV___F_G_IVSQNRR________DogFRL___F_G_IASQVRRQ_______Guinea pig_________The amino acid sequence for frog gut neuromedian U can be accessed in the Swiss-Prot Database under accession no.

The frog NmU-23, along with porcine NmU-25 and NmU-8 produced dose-dependent contractions in rat uterine smooth muscle preparations (Fig.2), with EC50 values of 1.1 ± 0.1, 1.8 ± 0.1, and 12 ± 0.6 nm, respectively. The potencies of porcine NmU-25 and frog NmU-23 were not significantly different; however, both peptides were significantly more potent than porcine NmU-8 (NmU-25 was 6.7 times and NmU-23 was 10.9 times more potent than NmU-8). The maximum contraction elicited by each peptide was not significantly different. Application of frog NmU induced contractions of human detrusor smooth muscle strips in a dose-dependent manner (n = 4) (Fig.3). It was apparent that 10 nm frog NmU-23 produced stronger contraction, suggesting a greater potency when compared with an equimolar concentration of porcine NmU-25 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, upon reapplication of the same concentration of porcine NmU-25 following frog NmU-23, a 35.3 ± 12.1% decrease was apparent when compared with the previously evoked response (n = 4).Figure 4Traces showing the repeated application of porcine NmU-25 (10 nm; small arrows) on human detrusor smooth muscle and the effect of application of frog NmU (10 nm) on the subsequent contraction elicited by porcine NmU-25 (10 nm).

https://openalex.org/W2054221842,"The eukaryotic chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) is required in vivo for the production of native actin and tubulin. It is a 900-kDa oligomer formed from two back-to-back rings, each containing eight different subunits surrounding a central cavity in which interactions with substrates are thought to occur. Here, we show that a monoclonal antibody recognizing the C terminus of the CCTα subunit can bind inside, and partially occlude, both cavities of apo-CCT. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate was programmed to synthesize β-actin and α-tubulin in the presence and absence of anti-CCTα antibody. The binding of the antibody inside the cavity and its occupancy of a large part of it does not prevent the folding of β-actin and α-tubulin by CCT, despite the fact that all the CCT in the in vitro translation reactions was continuously bound by two antibody molecules. Furthermore, no differences in the protease susceptibility of actin bound to CCT in the presence and absence of the monoclonal antibody were detected, indicating that the antibody molecules do not perturb the conformation of actin folding intermediates substantially. These data indicate that complete sequestration of substrate by CCT may not be required for productive folding, suggesting that there are differences in its folding mechanism compared with the Group I chaperonins.

Each ring encloses a cavity that is capped by the co-chaperonin ring of Group I chaperonins, such as GroES in the case of GroEL (1.Xu X. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), or access to the cavity may be closed off by an in-built lid, which is the helical protrusion of the thermosome, a Group II chaperonin (2.Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.-O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Two extreme views can be taken for the existence of cavities in chaperonins. Either they act primarily as folding cages, which sequester folding polypeptide chains, or they exist as a consequence of the allosteric mechanism of action of chaperonin rings, which may require the specific positioning of subunits in relation to one another. The rings of the Group II chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide 1 (CCT)1 are composed of eight different subunit species (4.Kubota H. Willison K.R. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-folding Catalysts. Sambrook/Tooze Publications at Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997: 207-226Google Scholar), with one copy of each subunit occupying a fixed position in each ring (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CCT subunits are divergent from each other in their apical, putative substrate binding domains (6.Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Unlike the Group I chaperonins, which fold a broad range of proteins, the folding substrates of CCT are predominantly limited to actins and tubulins (7.Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Willison K. Yaffe M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), although G-protein α-transducin has recently been identified as a substrate for CCTin vivo (8.Farr G.W. Schar I.E.-C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The complex arrangement of divergent CCT subunits and the limited number of CCT substrates are highly suggestive of specific, sequence-dependent interactions occurring between CCT and its substrates, rather than the more general interactions that presumably occur between GroEL (which contains only one type of subunit) and non-native proteins (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study we have utilized a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 23C, which recognizes the extreme C terminus of the CCTα subunit (9.Harrison Lavoie K.J. Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Collison K.S. Nutland E. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2847-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the Group I chaperonin, GroEL (11.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), and of the Group II chaperonin, the thermosome (3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), has shown that the C termini lie within the central cavity. Therefore, an antibody such as 23C would be expected to occupy at least part of the central cavity of CCT. This has been confirmed here by using electron microscopy to analyze negatively stained CCT-23C complexes. The images also support the biochemical model in which CCT contains a single copy of CCTα in each ring, although they do not prove formally that this is the case. The ability of CCT to produce native actin and tubulin when bound by two molecules of the 23C antibody has been investigated in functional in vitro translational experiments using rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with both β-actin and α-tubulin. CCT-23C complexes were obtained by incubation of CCT with excess 23C, which yields a mixture of single bound and double bound CCT-23C complexes. Lower antibody/CCT ratios were used for electron microscopy compared to the biochemical experiments to reduce the background on the grid due to unbound free antibody. Afterward, CCT-23C complexes were incubated with 10 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm ATP to induce the appearance of a larger percentage of side views and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Front and side views of the CCT-23C complexes were directly recorded using a GATAN ssCCD camera attached to a JEOL 1200EX II microscope. The particles were centered using a synthetic mask and aligned using a free-pattern algorithm (12.Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 13.Marco S. Chagoyen M. Gerado de la Fraga L. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The average images of the front views of the CCT-23C complexes and of the side views of CCT bound to one or two 23C antibodies were generated with 423, 371, and 71 particles, respectively. In vitro translations of β-actin and α-tubulin (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were carried out by priming TnTTM rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI) with Bluescript SKII+ plasmids encoding full-length human β-actin and α-tubulin cDNAs cloned in T7 orientation for transcription. Co-translations were carried out with a 1.325-μg input DNA template in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 40 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine (in vitrocell-labeling grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 30 °C with the β-actin and α-tubulin DNA template ratio optimized to produce similar levels of native proteins. Time course samples (4 μl) were taken and further translation was stopped by addition of EDTA (pH 8.0) to 6 mm. Samples were stored on ice prior to loading on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out according to Liou and Willison (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Upon co-translation, to quantitate more accurately the35S-protein bands corresponding to native β-actin and α-tubulin monomers by phosphor imaging, monoclonal antibodies to β-actin and α-tubulin were added to samples of the reticulocyte mixture after translation had been stopped by the addition of EDTA. The formation of actin- or tubulin-antibody complexes results in a less diffuse migration of the [35S]β-actin and [35S]α-tubulin polypeptides during electrophoresis but still allows for discrimination of the respective proteins. Samples of reticulocyte lysate reaction (2 μl) were mixed with 6 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1.1 μg of anti-β-actin mAb (A5441, Sigma), and 1.5 μg of anti-α-tubulin mAb (T5168, Sigma) and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to analysis by native PAGE and autoradiography. One objective of these experiments was to address the question of the degree of homogeneity of CCT. Is “core” CCT composed of two identical rings containing one copy of each of the eight CCT subunits as previously proposed (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)? Biochemical analysis of the CCT/antibody interaction showed that the migration of rabbit CCT in native polyacrylamide gel bandshift assays can be substantially retarded by addition of mAb 23C, which binds specifically to the CCTα subunit, and that replacement of one CCTα subunit by a mutant CCTα subunit unable to bind mAb 23C produced an intermediately migrating complex (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Liou et al.'s interpretation of these results was that the CCT 16-mer contains two copies of the CCTα subunit, one in each ring. Furthermore, because all CCT complexes were shifted by mAb 23C in these experiments, Liou et al. (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggested that all CCT complexes contain two copies of the CCTα subunit. Now we have examined CCT-mAb 23C complexes by negative-stain electron microscopy and image processing. CCT-antibody complexes are composed of CCT and either one (Fig. 1 B) or two (Fig. 1 C) antibody molecules. Side views of double antibody-bound CCT only showed one antibody bound to each ring (Fig.1 C), which is consistent with there being only one CCTα subunit present in each ring. However, if two CCTα subunits were directly adjacent in each of the rings, it is possible that steric hindrance would result in only one antibody molecule binding. The disposition of antibody in the double bound complexes also shows that the CCTα subunits do not contact each other across the rings; in fact, the two CCTα subunits are opposite, or nearly opposite, each other in the opposing rings. Clearly, the antibody binds within the central cavity of CCT and partially occludes it, suggesting that the C terminus of CCTα is located within the cavity. Although the C termini of the chaperonin subunits in the structures of GroEL (11.Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) and the thermosome (3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) are disordered, the structures show that they are also located within the central cavity. A further indication that 23C is fairly deeply embedded in the cavity of CCT is that, although 23C is a bivalent IgG antibody, it is not able to cross-link multiple CCT complexes (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, if an anti-rat secondary antibody is added to the CCT-23C complex, all the CCT becomes cross-linked and trapped in the well of a native gel (data not shown), demonstrating that the Fc portion of the 23C IgG is protruding, as can be seen clearly in the side view images of 23C-decorated complexes (Fig. 1,B and C). We have already shown that 23C can bind CCT complexes that contain bound substrates such as α-tubulin (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether 23C might interfere with processing of substrates by CCT in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation reactions, and we have analyzed β-actin and α-tubulin folding in this system. Various experiments were carried out to optimize the amount of 23C to avoid inhibitory effects of the addition of exogenous protein to this biochemically rather labile system. A final concentration of 60 μg ml−1 23C was well tolerated (data not shown), and this concentration was in excess for complete CCT binding. An example of a stacking gel is shown (Fig.2 A) to confirm that little protein denaturation/aggregation is occurring in this system. Individual translation reactions were programmed with both β-actin and α-tubulin to act as internal controls for each other for any possible effects of 23C on folding of substrates. The results are clear and slightly surprising; there are no inhibitory effects of 23C on the rate of production or yield of either β-actin or α-tubulin over a 90-min time course (Fig. 2, A–G). The lag phase seen during the production of α-tubulin monomers may be a result of the co-factor binding of α-tubulin after release from CCT (14.Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and has been observed previously in our native gel system (Fig. 2) (10.Liou K.F. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the total level of native actin produced in the presence and absence of 23C appears unchanged, it would appear that some difference occurs between the distribution of actin in the two closely migrating actin bands shown in Fig. 2. However, upon further analysis no difference could be detected by SDS-PAGE ± 23C (Fig.3 A), and both preparations of β-actin folded in the presence and absence of 23C bound to DNase I (Fig. 3 B), showing that the β-actin produced is native. The susceptibility of β-actin to cleavage by trypsin while bound to CCT and CCT-23C complexes was analyzed by semi-native diagonal electrophoresis (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The β-actin bound to both CCT and CCT-23C consists of two closely migrating species corresponding to native β-actin (Fig. 4, A andC, asterisks) and three smaller fragments, known to be the products of initiations at internal methionines during translation 3E. A. McCormack and K. R. Willison, unpublished results. (Fig. 4,A and B). Upon trypsin treatment a further three β-actin fragments were detected bound to CCT (Fig. 4 C,arrowheads), whereas no native G-actin was digested under these conditions, consistent with the notion that β-actin is in a different conformation to native G-actin when bound to CCT (Fig. 4,C and D). This suggests that the presence of the antibody does not alter the binding or conformation of β-actin sufficiently to result in changes in protease sensitivity when β-actin is bound to CCT-23C complexes. The amount of 23C added, in this proteolysis experiment only, was sufficient to produce a partial shift of CCT (Fig. 4, B and D). This made it possible to confirm that the trypsin susceptibility of the β-actin when bound to either CCT or CCT-23C is the same within a single sample.Figure 3Analysis of the integrity of β-actin produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of the 23C mAb. A, human β-actin was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of 60 μg ml−1 23C mAb. Translation was stopped after 90 min by the addition of EDTA to 6 mm. Samples (4 μl) were prepared for SDS-PAGE and resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and the production of 35S-labeled β-actin was analyzed by autoradiography. The positions of molecular standards and their sizes (in kDa) are indicated on the left. B, 1 μl of stopped lysate was incubated in the presence and absence of 10 μg of DNase I with PBS added to 10 μl for 30 min at 4 °C. 1.5 μl of loading buffer was added, and the entire sample was resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide native gel followed by autoradiography. The positions of CCT, native β-actin, β-actin/DNase I complex, and a β-actin complex formed during later stages of translation (but disrupted in the presence of DNase I) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Limited proteolysis of β-actin bound to CCT and CCT-23C complexes.Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (50 μl) was programmed with 0.9 μg of cDNA encoding full-length human β-actin in the presence and absence of the 23C mAb. After translation for 20 min at 30 °C, 1-μl samples were incubated in the presence and absence of 10 ng of trypsin for 15 min at room temperature. 6 μl of PBS and 1 μl of sample buffer were added, and the entire sample was resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide native gel. Lanes were excised, rotated 90°, and run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. A, β-actin translated in the absence of 23C; B, β-actin translated in the presence of 23C; C, β-actin translated in the absence of 23C followed by trypsin treatment; D, β-actin translated in the presence of 23C with subsequent trypsin treatment. The positions of unshifted (CCT (u)) and antibody-shifted (CCT (s)) CCT and the position of native β-actin in the first gel dimension are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cavity of the thermosome has a volume of 130,000 Å3 (3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and we have recently shown the striking similarity in volume of the thermosome and the asymmetric folding cavity of CCT (15.Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Radermacher M. Steinbacher S. Valpuesta J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Approximately 20% of the volume of the CCT cavity is occupied by antibody (Fig. 1 A) as measured by the signal of the two-dimensional projection of the density. An IgG antibody has a total volume estimated at 100,000 Å3, and each Fab comprises around 30% of the molecule. Because it can be seen that only one combining site of the 23C mAb enters the CCT cavity and that the Fc portion protrudes, one can estimate that 30,000/130,000,i.e. 23% of the CCT cavity would be occluded, in good agreement with the experiment. Although we do not know the conformation that a substrate such as actin (375 amino acid residues) adopts when it is enclosed inside the CCT cavity, one can estimate the volume of a globular protein of 375 residues to be 29,000 Å3 and conclude that such a molecule would occupy 22% of the cavity. However, it should be noted that native actin is not globular and its maximum dimensions will only just fit in the cavity (3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In principle there could be room to accommodate a folding actin or tubulin molecule and 23C in the folding cavity. A recent study on the maximum size of proteins able to occupy and complete folding in the GroEL cavity underneath GroES showed that a 54-kDa fused dimer of green fluorescence protein could fold, but an 82-kDa green fluorescence protein trimer could not (16.Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). CCT seems to function normally with its cavity occupied at the upper limit of the GroEL substrate size range, because β-actin + 23C and α-tubulin + 23C have a combined molecular mass of 70- and 80-kDa, respectively. Furthermore, Weissman et al. (17.Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) showed that the substrate is protease-resistant in preformed polypeptide-GroEL-GroES complexes, although we found β-actin bound to CCT to be highly sensitive to proteolysis. It can be seen from the negatively stained side views that the CCT rings bound by 23C are distorted; this may reflect the flexibility of the helical protrusions of the apical domains. Perhaps, because of this inherent flexibility (2.Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.-O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 3.Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.-O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the apical domains are still able to undergo the movements required (15.Llorca O. Smyth M.G. Carrascosa J.L. Willison K.R. Radermacher M. Steinbacher S. Valpuesta J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to close off the CCT cavity in the presence of antibody without perturbing the folding cycle. Apart from being smaller, the antibody-occluded folding cavity could reasonably be expected to have a different structure, with some of its internal surfaces completely obscured. If all the eight apical domains have equivalent functions, one would predict the folding rates of the two substrates would be slowed down by the presence of 23C. Therefore, as suggested by Liou and Willison (5.Liou A.K.F. Willison K.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4311-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), perhaps not all the subunits are involved in substrate interactions. Nevertheless, both actin and tubulin fold normally in such smaller cavities, and these experiments point to differences between the folding mechanisms of CCT and GroEL."
