https://openalex.org/W2062729355,"In seven strains of cultured normal human osteoblast-like cells, a mean of 1615 molecules of tritium-labeled 17 beta-estradiol per cell nucleus could be bound to specific nuclear sites. The nuclear binding of the labeled steroid was temperature-dependent, steroid-specific, saturable, and cell type-specific. These are characteristics of biologically active estrogen receptors. Pretreatment with 10 nanomolar estradiol in vitro increased the specific nuclear binding of progesterone in four of six cell strains, indicating an induction of functional progesterone receptors. RNA blot analysis demonstrated the presence of messenger RNA for the human estrogen receptor. The data suggest that estrogen acts directly on human bone cells through a classical estrogen receptor-mediated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2103957060,"The bicoid (bcd) protein in a Drosophila embryo is derived from an anteriorly localized mRNA and comes to be distributed in an exponential concentration gradient along the anteroposterior axis. To determine whether the levels of bcd protein are directly related to certain cell fates, we manipulated the density and distribution of bcd mRNA by genetic means, measured the resultant alterations in height and shape of the bcd protein gradient, and correlated the gradient with the fate map of the respective embryos. Increases or decreases in bcd protein levels in a given region of the embryo cause a corresponding posterior or anterior shift of anterior anlagen in the embryo. The bcd protein thus has the properties of a morphogen that autonomously determines positions in the anterior half of the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2019562739,"The maternal gene bicoid (bcd) organizes anterior development in Drosophila. Its mRNA is localized at the anterior tip of the oocyte and early embryo. Antibodies raised against bcd fusion proteins recognize a 55-57 kd doublet band in Western blots of extracts of 0-4 hr old embryos. This protein is absent or reduced in embryonic extracts of nine of the 11 bcd alleles. The protein is concentrated in the nuclei of cleavage stage embryos. It cannot be detected in oocytes, indicating temporal control of bcd mRNA translation. The bcd protein is distributed in an exponential concentration gradient with a maximum at the anterior tip, reaching background levels in the posterior third of the embryo. The gradient is probably generated by diffusion from the local mRNA source and dispersed degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2086322317,"Mutational inactivation of the retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB) gene, a recessive cancer gene, has been implicated in the genesis of retinoblastoma and certain other human neoplasms. This gene is now shown to be inactivated in two of nine human breast cancer cell lines examined. The RB gene of one cell line had a homozygous internal duplication of a 5-kilobase region containing exons 5 and 6. The RB messenger RNA transcript was correspondingly lengthened, and its translation was probably terminated prematurely due to a shifted reading frame. The other cell line had a homozygous deletion of the RB gene that removed the entire gene beyond exon 2. The RB gene product, pp110RB, was not detectable in either cell line by immuno-precipitation with specific antibodies. These findings are significant in relation to proposed genetic mechanisms of breast cancer formation."
https://openalex.org/W2029475329,"We have constructed novel chimeric receptors, GAL-ER and GAL-GR, consisting of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 joined to the C-terminal region containing the hormone-binding domain of either the human estrogen (hER) or human glucocorticoid (hGR) receptor. Stimulation of transcription by GAL-ER and GAL-GR from GAL4-responsive reporter genes was hormone dependent, and the activation function has been localized to the hER or hGR region. Both chimeric receptors recognized GAL4-responsive elements only in the presence of hormone or anti-hormone, yet solely the hormone was capable of stimulating transcription. These and additional results suggest that the hormone plays at least a dual role. First, the hormone, or anti-hormone, is responsible for receptor ""transformation"" allowing the recognition of responsive DNA elements. Second, the hormone, but not the anti-hormone, can induce a transcription activation function present in the region that contains the hormone-binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W2018151716,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was studied by fluorescence microscopy of living CV-1 cells treated with the fluorescent carbocyanine dye DiOC6(3). Using video recording and image processing techniques, several distinct forms of highly localized movements of ER were documented, categorized, and analyzed in terms of mechanism and structural implications. These include tubule branching, ring closure, and sliding. These localized movements have been observed to generate the basic elements of ER: linear tubules, polygonal reticulum, and triple junctions. We propose that as such they act as the mechanism for constructing the polygonal lattice of interconnected membrane tubules that constitutes ER. The nature of these movements suggests possible involvement of the cytoskeleton, and, in view of the close correlations in the distributions of ER and microtubules, and the accompanying paper (Dabora and Sheetz), it is possible that microtubules may play a role in generating ER motility and in constructing and maintaining the ER network in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2046975858,"Recent growth studies in children suggest that there is no threshold for adverse effects from the universal exposure to inorganic lead. The biochemical mechanisms mediating low-level toxicity are unclear, but in several biological systems, lead alters calcium-mediated cellular processes and may mimic calcium in binding to regulatory proteins. Here we present evidence that lead stimulates diacylglycerol-activated calcium and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, partially purified from rat brain. Picomolar concentrations of lead are equivalent to micromolar calcium in kinase activation, so this regulatory enzyme is sensitive to the lead levels expected from current environmental exposure."

https://openalex.org/W1965158583,"An N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive transport component (NSF) has been purified on the basis of its ability to support transport between Golgi cisternae. We now report that NSF is needed for membrane fusion. Thus, when NSF is withheld from incubations of Golgi stacks with cytosol and ATP, uncoated transport vesicles accumulate. Biochemical experiments confirm this conclusion and reveal that NSF is needed to form the first of two previously described prefusion complexes. NSF, therefore, acts within a cascade in which a vesicle-cisterna complex is matured until it is competent for fusion. We suggest that this reflects the stepwise assembly of a multisubunit ""fusion machine"" following vesicle attachment."

https://openalex.org/W2060690425,"A method of combinatorial cassette mutagenesis was designed to readily determine the informational content of individual residues in protein sequences. The technique consists of simultaneously randomizing two or three positions by oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis, selecting for functional protein, and then sequencing to determine the spectrum of allowable substitutions at each position. Repeated application of this method to the dimer interface of the DNA-binding domain of lambda repressor reveals that the number and type of substitutions allowed at each position are extremely variable. At some positions only one or two residues are functionally acceptable; at other positions a wide range of residues and residue types are tolerated. The number of substitutions allowed at each position roughly correlates with the solvent accessibility of the wild-type side chain."

https://openalex.org/W2064511169,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a naturally occurring phospholipid that serves as a critical mediator in diverse biological and pathophysiological processes. In this study of the interactions of PAF with neuronal cells, it was found that PAF increased the intracellular levels of free calcium ions in cells of the clones NG108-15 and PC12. The increase was dependent on extracellular calcium and was inhibited by the antagonistic PAF analog CV-3988 and by the calcium-influx blockers prenylamine and diltiazem. A functional consequence of this interaction was revealed by measuring a PAF-elicited, Ca2+-dependent secretion of adenosine triphosphate from PC12 cells. Exposure of NG108-15 cells for 3 to 4 days to low concentrations of PAF induced neuronal differentiation; higher concentrations were neurotoxic. Thus, by influencing Ca2+ fluxes, PAF may play a physiological role in neuronal development and a pathophysiological role in the degeneration that occurs when neurons are exposed to circulatory factors as a result of trauma, stroke, or spinal cord injury."

https://openalex.org/W2074440847,"Arsenic is a well-established carcinogen in humans, but there is little evidence for its carcinogenicity in animals and it is inactive as an initiator or tumor promoter in two-stage models of carcinogenicity in mice. Two arsenic salts (sodium arsenite and sodium arsenate) induced a high frequency of methotrexate-resistant 3T6 cells, which were shown to have amplified copies of the dihydrofolate reductase gene. The ability of arsenic to induce gene amplification may relate to its carcinogenic effects in humans since amplification of oncogenes is observed in many human tumors. The inability of arsenic to induce gene mutations may relate to the negative results of arsenic in long-term animal studies and suggests that these experiments may not detect some environmental agents that act late in the carcinogenic process in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2074389301,"Three forms of nonassociative learning (habituation, dishabituation, and sensitization) have commonly been explained by a dual-process view in which a single decrementing process produces habituation and a single facilitatory process produces both dishabituation and sensitization. A key prediction of this view is that dishabituation and sensitization should always occur together. However, we show that dishabituation and sensitization, as well as an additional process, inhibition, can be behaviorally dissociated in Aplysia by (i) their differential time of onset, (ii) their differential sensitivity to stimulus intensity, and (iii) their differential emergence during development. A simple dual-process view cannot explain these results; rather, a multiprocess view appears necessary to account for nonassociative learning in Aplysia ."
https://openalex.org/W1945168372,"An increased airway response to various bronchocon-stricting agents is one of the hallmarks of asthma. An interdependence of heredity and environment appears to determine this nonspecific hyperreactivity of the airways. The present study describes the patterns of inheritance of the airway response to a direct mediator of smooth muscle contraction (acetylcholine) in A/J and C3H/HeJ inbred mice and their offspring. The mean airway response to acetylcholine was greater than sixfold higher in A/J mice as compared with C3H/HeJ mice. Two phenotypes were easily distinguished on the basis of airway responses to acetylcholine in the progeny of A/J and C3H/HeJ mice. These two phenotypes were termed HYPERREACTIVE (after the A/J strain) and HYPOREACTIVE (after the C3H/HeJ strain). The observed frequencies of HYPERREACTIVE and HYPOREACTIVE phenotypes in the (A/J × C3H/HeJ) Fl; (C3H/HeJ × A/J) F1 × C3H/HeJ (C3H/HeJ backcross); and the [(A/J × C3H/HeJ) F1 × (C3H/HeJ x A/J) F1] F2 are consistent with a single autosomal recessive gene primarily controlling acetylcholine-mediated airway responses. This single gene difference in airway response is completely inhibited by atropine and therefore mediated entirely by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.— Levitt, R. C.; Mitzner, W.

https://openalex.org/W1981864966,"A protein designated p14 was purified from a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV Mne ) and was shown by amino acid sequence analysis to be nearly identical to the predicted translational product of a unique open reading frame (X-ORF) in the nucleotide sequences of SIV mac and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). Thus the X-ORF is proven to be a new retroviral gene. The p14 is present in SIV Mne in molar amounts equivalent to those of the gag proteins. This is the first example of a retrovirus that contains a substantial quantity of a viral protein that is not a product of the gag , pro , pol , or env genes. SIV p14 and its homolog in HIV-2 may function as nucleic acid binding proteins since purified p14 binds to single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro. Antisera to the purified protein detected p14 in SIV Mne , SIV mac , and a homologous protein (16 kilodaltons) in HIV-2 but did not react with HIV-1. Diagnostic procedures based on this novel protein will distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2."

Sera from HIV-1-infected patients and from goats immunized with polyacrylamide gel-purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp120), native gp120, or gp120-derived recombinant peptides, showed marked heterogeneity in neutralizing activity against these closely related viruses. The change of a single amino acid residue in gp120 may account for such ""clonal restriction"" of neutralizing activity."

https://openalex.org/W2071092703,"Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a human autosomal recessive disease caused by a deficiency of aldolase B that results in an inability to metabolize fructose and related sugars. We report here the first identification of a molecular lesion in the aldolase B gene of an affected individual whose defective protein has previously been characterized. The mutation is a G→C transversion in exon 5 that creates a new recognition site for the restriction enzyme Ahall and results in an amino acid substitution (Ala→Pro) at position 149 of the protein within a region critical for substrate binding. Utilizing this novel restriction site and the polymerase chain reaction, the patient was shown to be homozygous for the mutation. Three other HFI patients from pedigrees unrelated to this individual were found to have the same mutation: two were homozygous and one was heterozygous. We suggest that this genetic lesion is a prevailing cause of hereditary fructose intolerance."

https://openalex.org/W2127098620,"Chalcone isomerase from soybean has been purified 11,000-fold over the crude extract. The purification procedure features pseudo-affinity chromatography on an Amicon Matrex Orange A column with selective elution by a product of the enzymatic reaction. The purified enzyme is greater than 99.5% pure and possesses a specificity activity of 340 IU/mg, which is 520-fold greater than previously reported. The apparent molecular weight of the chalcone isomerase is 24,000 as determined from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and from size exclusion chromatography under native conditions on Sephacryl S-200. The enzyme exists as a monomer that migrates on isoelectric focusing gels with a pI of 5.7. Amino acid analysis indicates that almost 50% of the residues are hydrophobic and yields a partial specific volume of 0.750 ml/g. Chalcone isomerase contains no carbohydrate moieties and has a blocked N terminus. The purified enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 2', 4',4-trihydroxychalcone (I) to (2S)-4',7-dihydroxyflavanone (II) at pH 7.6 with a second order rate constant, kcat/Km, of 1.1 X 10(9) M-1 min-1 and an apparent equilibrium constant, [II]/[I], of 7.6. The rate constant for the conversion of enzyme-bound substrate to the (2S)-flavanone, kcat = 11,000 min-1, exceeds the spontaneous conversion by 36 million-fold. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of (2S)-flavanone over 100,000-fold faster than to the (2R)-flavanone, indicating that the enzyme is highly stereoselective, yielding over 99.999% of the (2S)-flavanone."

Neural crest cells from the axolotl embryo responded to extracellular matrix material explanted from the subepidermal migratory pathway by dispersing and by differentiating into pigment cells. In contrast, matrix material from the presumptive site of dorsal root ganglia stimulated pronounced cell-cell association and neurotypic expression. Cell line segregation during ontogeny of the neural crest that leads to diversification into pigment cells of the skin or into elements of the peripheral nervous system appears to be controlled in part by local cell-matrix interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1986712100,"The geometric properties of duplex DNA are systematically altered when the DNA is wrapped on a protein surface. The linking number of surface-wrapped closed circular DNA is the sum of two integers: the winding number, phi, a function of the helical repeat; and the surface linking number, SLk, a newly defined geometric constant that accounts for the effects of surface geometry on the twist and writhe of DNA. Changes in the helical repeat, h, and in the winding number can be deduced solely from surface geometry and superhelix density, sigma. This treatment relates the theoretically important properties twist and writhe to the more experimentally accessible quantities phi, h, SLk, and sigma. The analysis is applied to three biologically important cases: interwinding of DNA in a plectonemic superhelix, catenated DNA, and minichromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1512904958,"Two lysophospholipase activities (designated I and II) were identified in the macrophage-like cell line P388D1. Lysophospholipase I was purified (8,500-fold) to homogeneity by DEAE-Sephacel, Sephadex G-75, Blue-Sepharose, and chromatofocusing chromatography. Lysophospholipase II was separated from the lysophospholipase I in the Blue-Sepharose step. The apparent molecular mass of lysophospholipase I and II are 27,000 and 28,000 daltons, respectively, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their pI values were 4.4 and 6.1 respectively, as determined by isoelectric focusing. Lysophospholipase I exhibited a broad pH optimum between 7.5-9.0. The double-reciprocal plot of the substrate dependence curve of the purified lysophospholipase I showed a break around the critical micelle concentration of the substrate (1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine). The apparent Km, determined from substrate concentrations above 10 microM was 22 microM, and the apparent Vmax was 1.3 mumol min-1mg-1. The purified enzyme did not have phospholipase A1, phospholipase A2, acyltransferase, or lysophospholipase-transacylase activity. No activity was detected toward triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, p-nitrophenol acetate, p-nitrophenol palmitate, or cholesterol ester. The enzyme did, however, hydrolyze monoacylglycerol although at a rate 20-fold less than lysophospholipid, 0.06 mumol min-1mg-1. The lysophospholipase I was inhibited by fatty acids but not by glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine, glycerol-3-phosphorylethanolamine, or glyc-fjerol-3-phosphorylserine. A synthetic manoalide analogue 3(cis,cis,-7,10)hexadecadienyl-4-hydroxy-2-butenolide inhibited the enzyme with half-inhibition (IC50) at about 160 microM. Triton X-100 decreased the enzymatic activity, although this apparent inhibition can be explained by a surface dilution effect. The pure lysophospholipase I was stable for at least 5 months at -20 degrees C in the presence of glycerol and beta-mercaptoethanol. Lysophospholipid also demonstrated a protective effect during the later stage of purification."
https://openalex.org/W1558731290,"In the I/Lyn mouse strain a mutation on the X chromosome results in a deficiency of the major calmodulin-regulated enzyme in skeletal muscle, phosphorylase kinase. Calmodulin has been identified as the delta-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, and it is estimated that approximately 40% of the total calmodulin in rabbit skeletal muscle is associated with the phosphorylase kinase hexadecamer (alpha, beta, gamma, delta)4. The absence of phosphorylase kinase in I/Lyn skeletal muscle results in a reduction in the total amount of calmodulin. The mechanisms affecting this reduction were investigated by comparing the abundance and heterogeneities in calmodulin mRNAs between normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient skeletal muscles. The results demonstrate that in normal tissue there are four species of calmodulin mRNA distinguished by their molecular weight. All four of these species are present in the deficient tissue, and none of them are preferentially reduced. However, there is a 54% reduction in all four mRNAs as well as in calmodulin in the deficient skeletal muscle relative to normal skeletal muscle. These results indicate that the expression of calmodulin mRNAs is coordinated with the expression of its major enzyme target in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1544037236,"Cyclase I from Salvia officinalis leaf catalyzes the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate to the stereo-chemically related bicyclic monoterpenes (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)-camphene and to lesser quantities of monocyclic and acyclic olefins, whereas cyclase II from this plant tissue converts the same acyclic precursor to (-)-alpha-pinene, (-)-beta-pinene and (-)-camphene as well as to lesser amounts of monocyclics and acyclics. These antipodal cyclizations are considered to proceed by the initial isomerization of the substrate to the respective bound tertiary allylic intermediates (-)-(3R)- and (+)-(3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate. [(3R)-8,9-14C,(3RS)-1E-3H]Linalyl pyrophosphate (3H:14C = 5.14) was tested as a substrate with both cyclases to determine the configuration of the cyclizing intermediate. This substrate with cyclase I yielded alpha-pinene and camphene with 3H:14C ratios of 3.1 and 4.2, respectively, indicating preferential, but not exclusive, utilization of the (3R)-enantiomer. With cyclase II, the doubly labeled substrate gave bicyclic olefins with 3H:14C ratios of from 13 to 20, indicating preferential, but not exclusive, utilization of the (3S)-enantiomer in this case. (3R)- and (3S)-[1Z-3H]linalyl pyrophosphate were separately compared to the achiral precursors [1-3H]geranyl pyrophosphate and [1-3H]neryl pyrophosphate (cis-isomer) as substrates for the cyclizations. With cyclase I, geranyl, neryl, and (3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate gave rise exclusively to (+)-alpha-pinene and (+)-camphene, whereas (3S)-linayl pyrophosphate produced, at relatively low rates, the (-)-isomers. With cyclase II, geranyl, neryl, and (3S)-linalyl pyrophosphate yielded exclusively the (-)-isomer series, whereas (3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate afforded the (+)-isomers at low rates. These results are entirely consistent with the predicted stereochemistries and additionally revealed the unusual ability of these enzymes to catalyze antipodal cyclizations when presented with the unnatural linalyl enantiomer."

Lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected in the isolated matrix vesicles only in the presence of detergents, suggesting that NADH, the cofactor for the assay, does not penetrate the membrane of matrix vesicles. In contrast, the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a marker enzyme of the outer surface of matrix vesicles, was detected in the matrix vesicles using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate both in the presence and absence of detergents. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was detected only in the cytosol of chondrocytes of the epiphyseal growth plates but not in other subcellular fractions, showing that lactate dehydrogenase is not from the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles of chondrocytes. The isolated matrix vesicles contained all five lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes but did not possess other cytosolic enzymes. These results show that lactate dehydrogenase is located in the matrix vesicles and suggest the presence of a mechanism for the specific uptake of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase and the possibility of enzymatic quantification of the matrix vesicles at various calcification sites."
https://openalex.org/W1561904972,"It is a common observation that cis-unsaturated and branched chain fatty acids, which are usually liquid, affect membrane function differently from saturated and trans-unsaturated fatty acids, which are usually solid. We also found that the former are much more potent than the latter in inhibiting viral hemolytic activity. A search for the origin of this difference revealed a correlation between inhibition and equilibrium surface pressure (the surface pressure at the air/water interface of a solution of the substance in question). Using a simple but rigorous thermodynamic analysis, we show that penetration of a lipid bilayer is correlated with equilibrium surface pressure of the penetrating molecule. We therefore conclude that an important reason for the difference in effects of liquid and solid fatty acids on membranes is the greater penetrability of the former relative to the latter. We suggest that attributing such effects to fluidity changes in the membrane should await demonstration of actual intramonolayer residence of the fatty acid in the membrane. The thermodynamic analysis is readily generalized and, in the absence of specific interactions between penetration and bilayer molecules, provides a convenient method for predicting membrane penetration by virtually any type of exogenous molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1558604072,"The major cell surface glycoprotein (ascites sialoglycoprotein-1 (ASGP-1] of ascites 13762 rat mammary tumor cells is a large (Mr greater than 500,000), highly glycosylated sialomucin which is present in great abundance (greater than 0.5% of total cell protein). Thus, these tumors provide a useful system for investigating the biosynthesis of O-glycosylated glycoproteins. Previous studies in this system have demonstrated that initiation of O-linked oligosaccharides occurs throughout most of the transit period of ASGP-1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. By pulse-chase threonine labeling and precipitation with peanut agglutinin, ASGP-1 is first observed as an immature lightly glycosylated form (Mr approximately 200,000) which is converted to a more mature, more heavily glycosylated form (designated the premature or P form) with a half-time of about 30 min. The P form is then more gradually converted into the mature ASGP-1. Analysis of glucosamine-labeled oligosaccharitols obtained from the immature form showed primarily unsialylated derivatives consisting of the structures of the size of the tetrasaccharide Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,6(Gal beta 1,3)GalNAc and smaller, whereas the mature form showed a mixture of sialylated and unsialylated structures. Desialylation of glucosamine-labeled mature form resulted in a glycoprotein intermediate in size between the immature and mature forms, indicating that the size change with maturation is not solely due to sialylation. Treatment of the cells with 10(-6) M monensin significantly reduced the conversion of immature to mature form without inhibiting initiation of O-linked oligosaccharides and without preventing sialylation. Analysis of oligosaccharitols obtained from ASGP-1 of monensin-treated cells showed that the major oligosaccharides are trisaccharide GlcNAc beta 1,6(Gal beta 1,3)GalNAc and sialylated trisaccharide GlcNAc beta 1,6(NeuAc alpha 2,3-Gal-beta 1,3) GalNAc. These results suggest that monensin specifically disrupts the compartment of the biosynthetic pathway which adds most of the beta 1,4-Gal to the oligosaccharides of ASGP-1 and that this compartment is separate from the primary site of sialylation."
