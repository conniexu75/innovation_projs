https://openalex.org/W1997183854,"Nonapoptotic forms of cell death may facilitate the selective elimination of some tumor cells or be activated in specific pathological states. The oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that we term ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron, but not other metals, and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x(c)(-)), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration."

While past work has focused on the role of these cells during disease, recent imaging studies reveal dynamic interactions between microglia and synaptic elements in the healthy brain. Despite these intriguing observations, the precise function of microglia at remodeling synapses and the mechanisms that underlie microglia-synapse interactions remain elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate a role for microglia in activity-dependent synaptic pruning in the postnatal retinogeniculate system. We show that microglia engulf presynaptic inputs during peak retinogeniculate pruning and that engulfment is dependent upon neural activity and the microglia-specific phagocytic signaling pathway, complement receptor 3(CR3)/C3. Furthermore, disrupting microglia-specific CR3/C3 signaling resulted in sustained deficits in synaptic connectivity. These results define a role for microglia during postnatal development and identify underlying mechanisms by which microglia engulf and remodel developing synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2054868321,"Here, we use single-molecule techniques to study the aggregation of α-synuclein, the protein whose misfolding and deposition is associated with Parkinson's disease. We identify a conformational change from the initially formed oligomers to stable, more compact proteinase-K-resistant oligomers as the key step that leads ultimately to fibril formation. The oligomers formed as a result of the structural conversion generate much higher levels of oxidative stress in rat primary neurons than do the oligomers formed initially, showing that they are more damaging to cells. The structural conversion is remarkably slow, indicating a high kinetic barrier for the conversion and suggesting that there is a significant period of time for the cellular protective machinery to operate and potentially for therapeutic intervention, prior to the onset of cellular damage. In the absence of added soluble protein, the assembly process is reversed and fibrils disaggregate to form stable oligomers, hence acting as a source of cytotoxic species."
https://openalex.org/W2047656863,"Neural-tube closure is a critical step of embryogenesis, and its failure causes serious birth defects. Coordination of two morphogenetic processes--convergent extension and neural-plate apical constriction--ensures the complete closure of the neural tube. We now provide evidence that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling directly links these two processes. In the bending neural plates, we find that a PCP-regulating cadherin, Celsr1, is concentrated in adherens junctions (AJs) oriented toward the mediolateral axes of the plates. At these AJs, Celsr1 cooperates with Dishevelled, DAAM1, and the PDZ-RhoGEF to upregulate Rho kinase, causing their actomyosin-dependent contraction in a planar-polarized manner. This planar-polarized contraction promotes simultaneous apical constriction and midline convergence of neuroepithelial cells. Together our findings demonstrate that PCP signals confer anisotropic contractility on the AJs, producing cellular forces that promote the polarized bending of the neural plate."
https://openalex.org/W2044217732,"Selective targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) offers promise for a new generation of therapeutics. However, assays for both human CSCs and normal stem cells that are amenable to robust biological screens are limited. Using a discovery platform that reveals differences between neoplastic and normal human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), we identify small molecules from libraries of known compounds that induce differentiation to overcome neoplastic self-renewal. Surprisingly, thioridazine, an antipsychotic drug, selectively targets the neoplastic cells, and impairs human somatic CSCs capable of in vivo leukemic disease initiation while having no effect on normal blood SCs. The drug antagonizes dopamine receptors that are expressed on CSCs and on breast cancer cells as well. These results suggest that dopamine receptors may serve as a biomarker for diverse malignancies, demonstrate the utility of using neoplastic hPSCs for identifying CSC-targeting drugs, and provide support for the use of differentiation as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2040737547,"We used magneto-encephalography to study the temporal dynamics of band-limited power correlation at rest within and across six brain networks previously defined by prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Epochs of transiently high within-network band limited power (BLP) correlation were identified and correlation of BLP time-series across networks was assessed in these epochs. These analyses demonstrate that functional networks are not equivalent with respect to cross-network interactions. The default-mode network and the posterior cingulate cortex, in particular, exhibit the highest degree of transient BLP correlation with other networks especially in the 14-25 Hz (β band) frequency range. Our results indicate that the previously demonstrated neuroanatomical centrality of the PCC and DMN has a physiological counterpart in the temporal dynamics of network interaction at behaviorally relevant timescales. This interaction involved subsets of nodes from other networks during periods in which their internal correlation was low."
https://openalex.org/W2004277471,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are responsible for a variety of processes in the mammalian brain including fast excitatory neurotransmission, postsynaptic plasticity, or synapse development. Here, with comprehensive and quantitative proteomic analyses, we demonstrate that native AMPARs are macromolecular complexes with a large molecular diversity. This diversity results from coassembly of the known AMPAR subunits, pore-forming GluA and three types of auxiliary proteins, with 21 additional constituents, mostly secreted proteins or transmembrane proteins of different classes. Their integration at distinct abundance and stability establishes the heteromultimeric architecture of native AMPAR complexes: a defined core with a variable periphery resulting in an apparent molecular mass between 0.6 and 1 MDa. The additional constituents change the gating properties of AMPARs and provide links to the protein dynamics fundamental for the complex role of AMPARs in formation and operation of glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2123850444,"We show that comprehensive sequence-function maps obtained by deep sequencing can be used to reprogram interaction specificity and to leapfrog over bottlenecks in affinity maturation by combining many individually small contributions not detectable in conventional approaches. We use this approach to optimize two computationally designed inhibitors against H1N1 influenza hemagglutinin and, in both cases, obtain variants with subnanomolar binding affinity. The most potent of these, a 51-residue protein, is broadly cross-reactive against all influenza group 1 hemagglutinins, including human H2, and neutralizes H1N1 viruses with a potency that rivals that of several human monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that computational design followed by comprehensive energy landscape mapping can generate proteins with potential therapeutic utility."
https://openalex.org/W2041977230,"Continuous turnover of neurons in the olfactory bulb is implicated in several key aspects of olfaction. There is a dramatic decline postnatally in the number of migratory neuroblasts en route to the olfactory bulb in humans, and it has been unclear to what extent the small number of neuroblasts at later stages contributes new neurons to the olfactory bulb. We have assessed the age of olfactory bulb neurons in humans by measuring the levels of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA. We report that 14C concentrations correspond to the atmospheric levels at the time of birth of the individuals, establishing that there is very limited, if any, postnatal neurogenesis in the human olfactory bulb. This identifies a fundamental difference in the plasticity of the human brain compared to other mammals.

Carbon dating establishes cell turnover dynamics in the human olfactory bulb The yearly exchange rate of nonneuronal cells is 2.0%–3.4% Olfactory bulb neurons are as old as the individual <1% of olfactory bulb neurons are exchanged over 100 years in humans Neural stem cells residing in the walls of the lateral ventricles of the brain give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb throughout life (Lois et al., 1996Lois C.

The new neurons integrate into the synaptic circuitry and are implicated in complex processes such as olfactory memory formation, odorant discrimination, and social interactions (Carlén et al., 2002Carlén M.

Olfactory bulb neurogenesis is well characterized in rodents and has been shown to persist in adult monkeys (Kornack and Rakic, 2001Kornack D.R. Rakic P.

USA. 2001; 98: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), but the extent and potential role of postnatal olfactory bulb neurogenesis in humans is unclear. Anosmia is a common and early symptom in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and it has been suggested that this may be due to reduced adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis (Höglinger et al., 2004Höglinger G.U. Rizk P. Muriel M.P. Duyckaerts C. Oertel W.H. Caille I. Hirsch E.C. Dopamine depletion impairs precursor cell proliferation in Parkinson disease.Nat.

Nannmark U. Anderson M.F. Axell M.Z. Wikkelso C. Holtås S. van Roon-Mom W.M. Björk-Eriksson T.

Recently, two studies demonstrated a dramatic decline in the number of cells with a marker profile and morphology of migratory neuroblasts after birth in humans (Sanai et al., 2011Sanai N. Nguyen T. Ihrie R.A. Mirzadeh Z. Tsai H.H. Wong M. Gupta N. Berger M.S. Huang E.

Zhang Q. et al.Identification and characterization of neuroblasts in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream of the adult human brain.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1534-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, both studies found neuroblasts also in adult subjects, albeit the cells did not form a distinct migratory stream but appeared as individual cells and at a very much lower frequency than in the perinatal period (Sanai et al., 2011Sanai N. Nguyen T. Ihrie R.A. Mirzadeh Z. Tsai H.H. Wong M. Gupta N. Berger M.S. Huang E. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. et al.Corridors of migrating neurons in the human brain and their decline during infancy.Nature. 2011; 478: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2011Wang C.

It is difficult to infer the extent of neurogenesis from the number of neuroblasts, as it is not possible to know whether the neuroblasts differentiate to mature neurons and integrate stably in the circuitry. Even in a situation in which a very small number of neuroblasts are present at any given time, the neuroblasts could potentially give rise to a substantial proportion of olfactory bulb neurons if they would integrate efficiently and if this process would be continuous over a long time. Moreover, there are also neural stem cells present in the adult rodent and human olfactory bulb, and new neurons may not only derive from the ventricle wall but may be generated locally in the olfactory bulb (Gritti et al., 2002Gritti A. Bonfanti L. Doetsch F. Caille I. Alvarez-Buylla A. Lim D.A. Galli R. Verdugo J.M. Herrera D.G. Vescovi A.L.

Giombini S. et al.Isolation and characterization of neural stem cells from the adult human olfactory bulb.Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Due to the important role of adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis in experimental animals and the suggested alteration of this process underlying common symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, we set out to establish to what extent this process is operational in humans. We report that there is a continuous turnover of nonneuronal cells throughout life but that there is minimal, if any, addition of new neurons after the perinatal period in humans. We have determined the age of olfactory bulb cells by measuring the concentration of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in genomic DNA (Spalding et al., 2005aSpalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Atmospheric 14C levels were stable until nuclear bomb tests conducted during the Cold War resulted in a dramatic increase (De Vries, 1958De Vries H. Atomic bomb effect: variation of radiocarbon in plants, shells, and snails in the past 4 years.Science. 1958; 128: 250-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Nydal and Lövseth, 1965Nydal R. Lövseth K. Distribution of radiocarbon from nuclear tests.Nature. 1965; 206: 1029-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There have been no major above ground nuclear tests after the International Test Ban Treaty in 1963, and the atmospheric 14C levels have since declined due to uptake by the biotope and diffusion from the atmosphere (Levin and Kromer, 2004Levin I. Kromer B. The tropospheric 14CO2 level in mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere (1959-2003).Radiocarbon. 2004; 46: 1261-1272Google Scholar, Levin et al., 2010Levin I. Naegler T. Kromer B. Diehl M.

Observations and modelling of the global distribution and long-term trend of atmospheric 14CO2.Tellus. 2010; 62: 26-46Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 14C in the atmosphere reacts with oxygen to form 14CO2 and enters the food chain through plant photosynthesis. By eating plants and animals that live off plants, the 14C concentration in the human body closely parallels that in the atmosphere at any given time (Harkness, 1972Harkness D.D. Further investigations of the transfer of bomb 14C to man.Nature. 1972; 240: 302-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Libby et al., 1964Libby W.F. Berger R. Mead J.F. Alexander G.V.

Buchholz B.A. Bergman L.-E. Druid H. Frisén J. Forensics: age written in teeth by nuclear tests.Nature. 2005; 437: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When cells undergo mitosis and duplicate their DNA, they integrate 14C with a concentration corresponding to that in the atmosphere, resulting in a stable date mark. By measuring 14C in genomic DNA and determining when the corresponding 14C concentration was present in the atmosphere, it is possible to establish the birth date of cells (Figure 1A ) and their turnover dynamics (Bergmann et al., 2009Bergmann O.

Britton T. et al.Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans.Nature. 2008; 453: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). Changes in DNA methylation can alter the 14C content of DNA, but not to a degree that can influence the analysis of cell turnover (Spalding et al., 2005aSpalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). 14C abundance can be measured by accelerator mass spectrometry, and we developed a protocol to enable analysis with increased sensitivity (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). Analysis of the 14C concentration in postmortem olfactory bulb genomic DNA from adult humans revealed levels corresponding to time points after the birth of the individual, establishing that there is significant postnatal cell turnover in the human olfactory bulb (p < 0.02; Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1 and Supplemental Information). The oldest studied individual, born more than 20 years before the onset of the increase in atmospheric 14C levels, had a 14C concentration significantly higher than that present in the period up to 1955, establishing that there is substantial cell turnover at least up to early adulthood in humans (Figure 1C). However, several of the individuals born before 1950 had genomic 14C concentrations lower than at any time after the onset of the nuclear bomb tests, indicating that there must be very long-lived cells in the olfactory bulb that have remained for more than 50 years. The human olfactory bulb contains approximately equal numbers of neurons and nonneuronal cells, and it is not possible to conclude from this data whether all cell types are exchanged or if cell turnover is restricted to one of these populations. In order to specifically establish the age and turnover of neurons and nonneuronal cells, respectively, we isolated neuronal nuclei labeled with an antibody to NeuN (Fox3) by flow cytometry (Figures 2A and 2B ) (Bhardwaj et al., 2006Bhardwaj R.D. Curtis M.A. Spalding K.L. Buchholz B.A. Fink D. Björk-Eriksson T. Nordborg C. Gage F.H. Druid H. Eriksson P.S. Frisén J. Neocortical neurogenesis in humans is restricted to development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12564-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Spalding et al., 2005aSpalding K.L. Bhardwaj R.D. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. Frisén J. Retrospective birth dating of cells in humans.Cell. 2005; 122: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). NeuN has been extensively validated as a marker for most neuronal subsets, but mitral cells and some glomerular layer neurons in the olfactory bulb are not immunoreactive to NeuN in rodents (Mullen et al., 1992Mullen R.J. Buck C.R. Smith A.M. NeuN, a neuronal specific nuclear protein in vertebrates.Development. 1992; 116: 201-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histological analysis revealed that there is a small subset of neurons also in the human olfactory bulb that are NeuN− (Figure 2C). We therefore wanted to develop an additional strategy to isolate neuronal nuclei from the human olfactory bulb, which would not exclude any neuronal subtype. We used antibodies to the RNA binding protein HuD, which is specific to postmitotic neurons (Barami et al., 1995Barami K. Iversen K. Furneaux H. Goldman S.A. Hu protein as an early marker of neuronal phenotypic differentiation by subependymal zone cells of the adult songbird forebrain.J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), to isolate nuclei from the adult human olfactory bulb (Figures 2D and 2E). Histological analysis confirmed that HuD antibodies label all cells with neuronal characteristics in the adult human olfactory bulb (Figure 2F and Figure S1). However, we found that HuD antibodies, in addition to neurons, also labeled a subset of nonneuronal cells (Figure 2F). Histology and flow cytometry revealed that the nonneuronal population labeled with HuD antibodies had oligodendrocyte morphology and coexpressed the oligodendrocyte lineage markers Sox10 and CNPase (Figures 2E and 2F and Figures S2 and S3). Thus, by isolating cell nuclei that were HuD+ and Sox10−, we were able to specifically isolate neuronal nuclei (Figure 2E). All NeuN+ nuclei were within the HuD+/Sox10− population and 93.5% ± 3.6% (mean ± SD) of HuD+/Sox10− nuclei were NeuN+, in line with only a small subpopulation of neurons being NeuN− in the adult human olfactory bulb. We used both these isolation strategies to birth date neurons and nonneuronal cells. Analysis of the 14C concentration in genomic DNA from isolated nonneuronal nuclei from the adult human olfactory bulb revealed levels corresponding to concentrations well after the birth of the individual in all cases, establishing substantial turnover of nonneuronal cells (p = 0.0002; Figure 3; see Supplemental Information). Integrating data from several individuals born at different times in relation to the nuclear bomb tests allows estimating the turnover dynamics of a cell population (Bergmann et al., 2009Bergmann O. Bhardwaj R.D. Bernard S. Zdunek S. Barnabé-Heider F. Walsh S. Zupicich J. Alkass K. Buchholz B.A. Druid H. et al.Evidence for cardiomyocyte renewal in humans.Science. 2009; 324: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar, Spalding et al., 2008Spalding K.L. Arner E. Westermark P.O. Bernard S. Buchholz B.A. Bergmann O. Blomqvist L. Hoffstedt J. Näslund E. Britton T. et al.Dynamics of fat cell turnover in humans.Nature. 2008; 453: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). This indicated an annual turnover rate of 2.0%–3.4% in the nonneuronal cell population (see Supplemental Information). This represents an average for all cells negative for the respective neuronal marker profile, and it is likely that the turnover dynamics vary between specific nonneuronal cell types. We next assessed the 14C concentration in genomic DNA from NeuN+ or HuD+/Sox10− neuronal nuclei. In all cases (n = 15), the 14C concentration in neuronal genomic DNA was very close to that present in the atmosphere at the time of birth of each individual (Figure 4) and not significantly different from what one would see if there was no postnatal generation of olfactory bulb neurons (p = 0.91; see Supplemental Information). We cannot exclude that there may be low-grade turnover of neurons, but at a constant rate, the annual turnover would be 0.008% ± 0.08% (mean ± SE; see Supplemental Information). That corresponds to <1% of neurons being exchanged after 100 years. It has been estimated that up to 50% of olfactory bulb neurons are exchanged annually in rodents (Imayoshi et al., 2008Imayoshi I.

Neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases and substance abuse have been suggested to reduce olfactory bulb neurogenesis (Hansson et al., 2010Hansson A.C. Nixon K. Rimondini R. Damadzic R.

However, as all studied individuals had neuronal 14C concentrations corresponding to the time around birth, we did not find any apparent correlation between these conditions and postnatal olfactory bulb neurogenesis in humans.

Functional studies in rodents have implicated adult neurogenesis in olfactory memory formation, odorant discrimination, and social interactions (Lazarini and Lledo, 2011Lazarini F. Lledo P.M. Is adult neurogenesis essential for olfaction?.Trends Neurosci. 2011; 34: 20-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The lack of comparable adult olfactory bulb neurogenesis in humans poses the question whether these functions are mediated by conceptually different mechanisms in humans, or whether the more limited dependence on olfaction in humans compared to rodents in part may be due to the lack of one type of plasticity, adult neurogenesis. Tissues were procured from cases admitted during 2005 and 2011 to the Department of Forensic Medicine in Stockholm for autopsy, after informed consent from relatives. Ethical permission for this study was granted by the Regional Ethical Committee in Stockholm. Whole olfactory bulbs from both hemispheres were analyzed. Cerebellar cortex samples from the same subjects served as controls. Brain tissue was frozen and stored at −80°C until further analysis. Tissue samples were thawed and Dounce homogenized in 10 ml lysis buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT). Homogenized samples were suspended in 20 ml of sucrose solution (1.7 M sucrose, 3 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]), layered onto a cushion of 10 ml sucrose solution, and centrifuged at 36,500 × g for 2.4 hr at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were resuspended in nuclei storage buffer (NSB) (10 mM Tris [pH 7.2], 2 mM MgCl2, 70 mM KCl, and 15% sucrose) for consecutive immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis. Isolated nuclei were stained with mouse NeuN (A-60) (Millipore, 1:1,000), rabbit Fox3 (Atlas Antibody, 1:300), mouse HuD (E-1) (Santa Cruz, 1:100), mouse HuD/HuC 16A11-biotin (Invitrogen, 1:300), or goat Sox10 (R&D, 1:300). NeuN (A-60) antibody was directly conjugated to Alexa 647 (Invitrogen Antibody Labeling Kit Alexa 647). All other primary antibodies were visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:500), Alexa 647 (1:500) (Invitrogen), or R-phycoerythrin (PE) (Santa Cruz, 1:100). Flow cytometry sorting was performed with a BD FACS Diva and flow cytometry analysis was performed with a BD FACS Aria instrument. Olfactory bulbs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde buffered in PBS for 24 hr and embedded in low-melting paraffin (52°C–54°C), according to standard procedures. Olfactory bulbs were sectioned (5 μm) longitudinally and orthogonally according to their long axis. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a descending ethanol series. Antigen retrieval was performed in citraconic acid solution (pH = 7.4; 0.05% citraconic acid) for 20 min in a domestic steamer (Namimatsu et al., 2005Namimatsu S. Ghazizadeh M. Sugisaki Y. Reversing the effects of formalin fixation with citraconic anhydride and heat: a universal antigen retrieval method.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were allowed to cool down for 20 min before immunostaining was started. Sections were incubated with the respective primary antibody overnight at 4°C: mouse NeuN (Millipore A-60 clone; 1:100), rabbit Fox3 (Atlas Antibody, 1:300), goat Sox10 (R&D, 1:100), rabbit calbindin (Abcam, 1:200), chicken MAP-2 (Abcam, 1:1,000), rabbit calretinin (Abcam, 1:200), rabbit parvalbumin (Abcam, 1:1,000), rabbit tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Millipore, 1:1,000), rabbit GAD65/67 (Millipore, 1:500), rabbit CNPase (Atlas Antibody, 1:400), mouse GFAP (Sigma Aldrich, 1:1,000), rabbit Iba1 (Wako, 1:1,000), mouse HuD (E-1) (Santa Cruz, 1:100), and mouse HuD/HuC 16A11-biotin (Invitrogen, 1:100), and visualized with the matching secondary antibody and streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 488, 546, or 647 (1:1,000, Invitrogen). All experiments were carried out in a clean room (ISO8) to prevent any carbon contamination of the samples. All glassware was prebaked at 450°C for 4 hr. DNA isolation was performed according to a modified protocol from Miller et al., 1988Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. A simple salting out procedure for extracting DNA from human nucleated cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17877) Google Scholar. Five hundred microliters of DNA lysis buffer (100 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, and 5 mM EDTA) and 6 μl Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) were added to the collected nuclei and incubated overnight at 65°C. RNase cocktail (Ambion) was added and incubated at 65°C for 1 hr. Half of the existing volume of 5 M NaCl solution was added and agitated for 15 s. The solution was spun down at 13,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant containing the DNA was transferred to a 12 ml glass vial. Three times the volume of absolute ethanol was added, and the glass vial was inverted several times to precipitate the DNA. The DNA precipitate was washed three times in DNA washing solution (70% Ethanol [v/v] and 0.5 M NaCl) and transferred to 500 μl DNase/RNAase free water (GIBCO/Invitrogen). The DNA was quantified and DNA purity verified by UV spectroscopy (NanoDrop). 14C accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurements were performed on graphitized samples. DNA in aqueous solution was freeze dried, combusted to CO2, and reduced to graphite according to the procedures described in Liebl et al., 2010Liebl J. Avalos Ortiz R. Golser R. Handle F.

LINC formation relies on direct binding of KASH and SUN in the perinuclear space. Thereby, molecular tethers are formed that can transmit forces for chromosome movements, nuclear migration, and anchorage. We present crystal structures of the human SUN2-KASH1/2 complex, the core of the LINC complex. The SUN2 domain is rigidly attached to a trimeric coiled coil that prepositions it to bind three KASH peptides. The peptides bind in three deep and expansive grooves formed between adjacent SUN domains, effectively acting as molecular glue. In addition, a disulfide between conserved cysteines on SUN and KASH covalently links both proteins. The structure provides the basis of LINC complex formation and suggests a model for how LINC complexes might arrange into higher-order clusters to enhance force-coupling.

The integrity and physical properties of the NE play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis, signaling, and organization of intracellular architecture (Mekhail and Moazed, 2010Mekhail K. Moazed D. The nuclear envelope in genome organization, expression and stability.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, Stewart et al., 2007Stewart C.L. Roux K.J. Burke B. Blurring the boundary: the nuclear envelope extends its reach.Science. 2007; 318: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The exchange of material between nucleus and cytoplasm is guaranteed by passageways through the NE that are formed by nuclear pore complexes (Onischenko and Weis, 2011Onischenko E. Weis K. Nuclear pore complex-a coat specifically tailored for the nuclear envelope.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Communication between nucleus and nuclear exterior is not limited to transport of macromolecules across the NE but involves connections of the NE and the cytoskeleton. These physical linkages are instrumental for plasticity of cellular organization and are required for processes such as nuclear migration and anchorage, meiotic chromosome movements, centrosome positioning, and global organization of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in Burke and Roux, 2009Burke B.

Here come the SUNs: a nucleocytoskeletal missing link.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 67-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The molecular tether between NE and cytoskeletal elements is built by protein complexes referred to as linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) (Crisp et al., 2006Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. Coupling of the nucleus and cytoplasm: role of the LINC complex.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). LINC complexes are conserved from yeast to human. They form bridges across the perinuclear space by pairing of KASH (Klarsicht, ANC-1, and Syne homology) and SUN (Sad1, UNC-84) proteins that localize to the ONM (outer nuclear membrane) and INM (inner nuclear membrane), respectively (Razafsky and Hodzic, 2009Razafsky D. Hodzic D. Bringing KASH under the SUN: the many faces of nucleo-cytoskeletal connections.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Starr and Fischer, 2005Starr D.A. Fischer J.A. KASH 'n Karry: the KASH domain family of cargo-specific cytoskeletal adaptor proteins.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). KASH proteins are tail-anchored membrane proteins. Their large cytoplasmic domains extend into the cytoplasm, where they interact with actin filaments, microtubules, intermediate filaments, or centrosomes. At their C termini, KASH proteins expose a short peptide of ∼30 residues into the perinuclear space. This luminal peptide together with the preceding transmembrane segment provides the characteristic signature of KASH proteins referred to as KASH domain (Starr and Han, 2002Starr D.A. Han M. Role of ANC-1 in tethering nuclei to the actin cytoskeleton.Science. 2002; 298: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The luminal KASH peptides of many family members are similar. Their conserved features are the presence of aromatic/hydrophobic residues at defined positions and proline(s) close to their C-terminal ends. Studies in various organisms have shown that KASH domains are necessary and sufficient for localization of KASH proteins to the ONM (reviewed in Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010Starr D.A. Fridolfsson H.N. Interactions between nuclei and the cytoskeleton are mediated by SUN-KASH nuclear-envelope bridges.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 421-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This is achieved by a direct interaction of the KASH peptide with members of the SUN protein family residing in the INM (Ostlund et al., 2009Ostlund C. Folker E.S. Choi J.C. Gomes E.R. Gundersen G.G.

Vertebrates possess at least four different KASH proteins (SYNE/Nesprin-1 to -4) that contain spectrin repeats in their cytoplasmic domains (Apel et al., 2000Apel E.D. Lewis R.M. Grady R.M.

Nesprin-1 and -2 (SYNE1, 2) exist in numerous splice isoforms. The giant isoforms of Nesprin-1 and -2 interact with actin via their N-terminal actin-binding domain, whereas other isoforms can associate with microtubule motors (Padmakumar et al., 2004Padmakumar V.C.

They are anchored in the INM by at least one transmembrane segment, exposing their N termini to the nucleoplasm. These nucleoplasmic domains harbor signals that aid targeting of SUN proteins to the INM and mediate association with nuclear binding partners such as the nuclear lamina (Fridkin et al., 2004Fridkin A.

The C-terminal segments of SUN proteins reside in the perinuclear space and consist of coiled-coil regions followed by the conserved SUN domain, which is required for KASH binding. Among the five characterized mammalian SUN proteins, only SUN1 and SUN2 are widely expressed (Crisp et al., 2006Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D.

How SUN and KASH interact to provide mechanical coupling between structural components of the nucleus and the cytoskeleton has remained elusive. Here, we present crystal structures of the SUN domain of human SUN2 in its free and KASH-bound conformations. These structures reveal a trimeric organization of SUN domains intimately bound to three KASH peptides at the SUN protomer interfaces. Biochemical and cell biological studies support and further qualify our structural findings. To define the minimal region in human SUN2 that is required for binding of the luminal part of KASH domains, we used recombinant KASH fusion proteins composed of an N-terminal protein A tag (zz) and the C-terminal 29 residues of human Nesprin-1 or -2 (Figure 1A ; zz-KASH1 and zz-KASH2) in pull-down experiments. First, we tested whether the KASH fusion proteins could interact with endogenous SUN proteins that are present in HeLa cell detergent extract. Both KASH1 and KASH2 retrieved SUN1 and SUN2 from the extract as verified by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). Binding of SUN proteins to KASH1/2 was specific, as no binding of SUN proteins was observed to either zz alone or zz-KASH2Δ, in which the four C-terminal amino acids of KASH that are required for interaction with SUN proteins are missing (Padmakumar et al., 2005Padmakumar V.C. Libotte T. Lu W. Zaim H. Abraham S. Noegel A.A. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Karakesisoglou I. The INM protein Sun1 mediates the anchorage of Nesprin-2 to the nuclear envelope.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3419-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Next, we tested direct KASH binding of recombinant SUN2 protein fragments comprising different regions of its luminal domain (Figures 1C and 1D). In agreement with published data (Ostlund et al., 2009Ostlund C. Folker E.S. Choi J.C. Gomes E.R. Gundersen G.G. Worman H.J. Dynamics and molecular interactions of linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 4099-4108Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we observed that a protein fragment comprising both the predicted coiled-coil regions and the C-terminal SUN domain of SUN2 (SUN2335–717) efficiently bound to both KASH peptides. However, neither the isolated coiled-coil region (SUN2335–539) nor the SUN domain alone (SUN2540–717) was sufficient for KASH interaction. Further deletion analysis revealed that the coiled-coil region preceding the SUN domain could be significantly shortened without losing KASH interaction. A fragment comprising an N terminally extended SUN domain (SUN2507–717) was found to be sufficient for efficient binding to both KASH peptides. When we introduced further truncations (Figure S1 available online), we observed that binding to KASH decreased (SUN2514–717) and finally became barely detectable (SUN2521–717). As the protein segment 507–539 is not part of the conserved SUN domain and is just adjacent to the last predicted coiled-coil of SUN2, we reasoned that the contribution of residues 507–539 to KASH binding may be attributed to a potential role in organization of the SUN domain into a higher-order structure. To test this assumption, we fused an unrelated, well-characterized coiled-coil region derived from the yeast transcription factor Gcn4 (Ciani et al., 2010Ciani B. Bjelic S. Honnappa S. Jawhari H. Jaussi R. Payapilly A. Jowitt T. Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Molecular basis of coiled-coil oligomerization-state specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 19850-19855Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in front of the three extended SUN domain fragments (SUN2521–717, SUN2514–717, and SUN2507–717). Strikingly, addition of this unrelated coiled-coil (ucc) restored the KASH binding capacity of SUN2521–717, demonstrating that residues 521–717 of SUN2 are sufficient for interaction with KASH peptides and suggesting that coiled-coil regions in front of the SUN domain contribute to the higher-order organization of SUN domains into a KASH-binding-competent state. After determining the minimal SUN domain of human SUN2, we set up crystallization screens for apo-SUN2522–717, SUN2522–717-KASH1 (Nesprin-1, residues 8769–8797), and SUN2522–717-KASH2 (Nesprin-2, residues 6857–6885). We first obtained crystals of apo-SUN2, diffracting to 2.2 Å (Table 1). We used selenomethionine-derivatized protein to solve the structure with the single-anomalous dispersion (SAD) method (for details, see Experimental Procedures). The refined apo-SUN2 structure (R/Rfree 16.9%/22.6%) was subsequently used to solve the structures of the SUN2-KASH1 and SUN2-KASH2 complexes by molecular replacement.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticshSUN2hSUN2-L546MhSUN2:KASH1hSUN2:KASH2Data CollectionData setnativeselenomethioninenativenativeSpace groupR32R32R32R32a, b, c (Å)79.6, 79.6, 199.179.7, 79.7, 200.279.6, 79.6, 256.479.3, 79.3, 260.0Wavelength (Å)0.97950.97920.97920.9792Resolution range (Å)56.7–2.2 (2.3–2.2)56.8–2.4 (2.5–2.4)85.5–2.3 (2.4–2.3)43.3–2.7 (2.8–2.7)Total reflections72,98856,71449,14652,267Unique reflections12,3059,51013,9448,912Completeness (%)99.8 (99.9)99.6 (99.8)99.6 (97.7)99.9 (99.8)Redundancy5.9 (6.1)3.1 (3.1)3.5 (3.4)5.9 (6.1)Rmerge (%)4.8 (57.0)4.6 (65.0)7.6 (70.7)5.5 (69.5)Rr.i.m.

Two sets of antiparallel β sheets composed of three and five strands form this basic structure. The β sandwich is decorated by two main additions, which are of major functional importance. At the N terminus, we find a helical extension (residues 525–540) that is involved in the formation of a coiled-coil. Between residues 567 and 587, there is a 20 residue extension that folds into a protruding antiparallel β sheet, which we term the KASH lid. As a third addition, residues 593–601 form a well-defined loop that surrounds and coordinates a bound cation via five backbone carbonyls; thus, we call this detail the cation loop. Judged by the coordination sphere, the bond distances (Harding, 2006Harding M.M. Small revisions to predicted distances around metal sites in proteins.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the temperature factor, we suggest that the bound cation is a potassium ion in our crystal. However, due to the possible malleability of the loop, the evolutionary relationship to other proteins (see below), and the ionic environment in the perinuclear space, a calcium ion might be coordinated in vivo. The arrangement of the cation loop is further defined by an intrachain disulfide bond formed between conserved cysteines at positions 601 and 705. SUN2 is organized around the 3-fold crystallographic axis to form a stable trimer (Figures 2C, 2D, and 2E), consistent with a recent crystallographic study of apo-SUN2 (Zhou et al., 2012Zhou Z. Du X. Cai Z. Song X. Zhang H. Mizuno T. Suzuki E. Yee M.R. Berezov A. Murali R. et al.Structure of the SUN domain defines features of a molecular bridge in the nuclear envelope.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 5317-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The contacts between the SUN2 protomers are substantial. First, the N-terminal helical extension forms an unusual, right-handed supercoiled three-helix bundle around a neatly packed hydrophobic core. Second, each SUN protomer interacts with its two neighbors via two independent binding surfaces. As a result, 1,766 Å2 of surface exposed area are buried by SUN-SUN interactions per interface. The SUN2 trimer harbors three independent binding sites for KASH2 peptides such that the overall complex is hexameric. The 23 visible residues of an individual KASH2 peptide bind in an extended groove meandering over the surface of the SUN2 trimer. The four C-terminal residues are buried in a deep pocket on SUN2 protomer 1. The next 11 residues are clamped between the KASH lid of protomer 1 and the β sandwich core of protomer 2. The eight N-terminal residues are bound by protomer 2 alone. C6862 is the last interacting residue and forms a disulfide bridge with C563 of SUN2. The SUN-KASH interaction is massive, and altogether 1,520 Å2 are additionally buried on each SUN2 protomer surface upon KASH binding, presumably generating high affinity for KASH and further stabilizing the trimer. It has been suggested previously that SUN proteins form higher-order oligomers, assuming a dimeric organization as the basic unit (Lu et al., 2008Lu W. Gotzmann J. Sironi L. Jaeger V.M. Schneider M. Lüke Y. Uhlén M. Szigyarto C.A. Brachner A. Ellenberg J. et al.Sun1 forms immobile macromolecular assemblies at the nuclear envelope.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Oligomerization was also observed during gel filtration of our samples (data not shown). To confirm that the trimeric form is the physiologically relevant oligomerization state of human SUN2, we studied its behavior in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation (Figure 2F). We used SUN2335–717 that comprises almost the entire luminal domain of SUN2, including both the predicted coiled-coil regions and the SUN domain. Data obtained by sedimentation equilibrium analysis using two different centrifugal speeds and two protein concentrations were globally fitted to a mass of 131.3 ± 6.1 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated mass of 138 kDa of a SUN2335–717 homotrimer. We conclude that the luminal domain of SUN2 is a homotrimer in solution. A hallmark feature of all KASH peptides identified to date is their strict location at the very C terminus of a protein. Thus, in the following discussion, we count the KASH peptide residues inversely, starting at the C terminus with 0 for the last residue followed by negative numbers (Figure 3). Residues 0 to −3 line a pocket crafted into the SUN2 surface of protomer 1 that is perfectly complementary to the shape of the peptide. The terminal carboxyl group points into this pocket, indicating that the positioning of the C-terminal end of KASH should be incompatible with extending the peptide by even one residue. The carboxyl group is specifically coordinated by the hydroxyl groups of S641, Y703, and Y707. H628, the C601-C705 disulfide, and a part of the cation loop form the backside of the pocket. The three prolines in the −1, −2, and −3 positions are all in the trans-conformation and in close van der Waals contact with SUN2. Residues in positions −4, −5, and −6 are more solvent exposed, and their side chains are not interacting strongly with SUN2. Tyr at −7 is again deeply buried in a slot lined by SUN2 protomers 1 and 2, explaining its strong conservation. The next three KASH residues are sandwiched between the KASH lid of protomer 1 and the core of protomer 2. They hydrogen bond to the KASH lid, in turn forming a third β strand. Like Tyr at −7, Leu at −9 is also deeply buried in a cleft between SUN2 protomers 1 and 2 and is again highly conserved. Pro at −11 ends the β strand. Between positions −11 and −12, the peptide kinks by about 90° to continue to the N-terminal Cys at −23. After the kink, the peptide exclusively interacts with SUN2 protomer 2. Other than bridging the distance to Cys at −23, the most noticeable interaction is burial of Phe at −17 into a hydrophobic pocket. Similar to positions −7 and −9, the large hydrophobic residue at −17 is also conserved. Cys at −23 is perfectly positioned to engage in a disulfide bond with SUN2-C563. The conservation of SUN2-C563 (Figure S2) and the presence of the SUN-KASH disulfide bond in living cells (Figure S3) suggest that it is physiologically important. Altogether, 24 hydrogen bonds—11 between SUN2 protomer 1 and KASH2 and 13 between protomer 2 and KASH2—tie the peptide strongly to the SUN2 trimer base. In comparison, merely three hydrogen b"
https://openalex.org/W2142393970,"F-box proteins are the substrate binding subunits of SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complexes. Using affinity purifications and mass spectrometry, we identified RRM2 (the ribonucleotide reductase family member 2) as an interactor of the F-box protein cyclin F. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are necessary for both replicative and repair DNA synthesis. We found that, during G2, following CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Thr33, RRM2 is degraded via SCF(cyclin F) to maintain balanced dNTP pools and genome stability. After DNA damage, cyclin F is downregulated in an ATR-dependent manner to allow accumulation of RRM2. Defective elimination of cyclin F delays DNA repair and sensitizes cells to DNA damage, a phenotype that is reverted by expressing a nondegradable RRM2 mutant. In summary, we have identified a biochemical pathway that controls the abundance of dNTPs and ensures efficient DNA repair in response to genotoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1994253350,"The elaborate courtship ritual of Drosophila males is dictated by neural circuitry established by the transcription factor Fruitless and triggered by sex-specific sensory cues. Deciphering the role of different stimuli in driving courtship behavior has been limited by the inability to selectively target appropriate sensory classes. Here, we identify two ion channel genes belonging to the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel/pickpocket (ppk) family, ppk23 and ppk29, which are expressed in fruitless-positive neurons on the legs and are essential for courtship. Gene loss-of-function, cell-inactivation, and cell-activation experiments demonstrate that these genes and neurons are necessary and sufficient to inhibit courtship toward males and promote courtship toward females. Moreover, these cells respond to cuticular hydrocarbons, with different cells selectively responding to male or female pheromones. These studies identify a large population of pheromone-sensing neurons and demonstrate the essential role of contact chemosensation in the early courtship steps of mate selection and courtship initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2082338288,"Activity-dependent gene expression triggered by Ca(2+) entry into neurons is critical for learning and memory, but whether specific sources of Ca(2+) act distinctly or merely supply Ca(2+) to a common pool remains uncertain. Here, we report that both signaling modes coexist and pertain to Ca(V)1 and Ca(V)2 channels, respectively, coupling membrane depolarization to CREB phosphorylation and gene expression. Ca(V)1 channels are advantaged in their voltage-dependent gating and use nanodomain Ca(2+) to drive local CaMKII aggregation and trigger communication with the nucleus. In contrast, Ca(V)2 channels must elevate [Ca(2+)](i) microns away and promote CaMKII aggregation at Ca(V)1 channels. Consequently, Ca(V)2 channels are ~10-fold less effective in signaling to the nucleus than are Ca(V)1 channels for the same bulk [Ca(2+)](i) increase. Furthermore, Ca(V)2-mediated Ca(2+) rises are preferentially curbed by uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. This source-biased buffering limits the spatial spread of Ca(2+), further attenuating Ca(V)2-mediated gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2066032422,"AnkyrinG (ankG) is highly enriched in neurons at axon initial segments (AISs) where it clusters Na(+) and K(+) channels and maintains neuronal polarity. How ankG becomes concentrated at the AIS is unknown. Here, we show that as neurons break symmetry, they assemble a distal axonal submembranous cytoskeleton, comprised of ankyrinB (ankB), αII-spectrin, and βII-spectrin, that defines a boundary limiting ankG to the proximal axon. Experimentally moving this boundary altered the length of ankG staining in the proximal axon, whereas disruption of the boundary through silencing of ankB, αII-spectrin, or βII-spectrin expression blocked AIS assembly and permitted ankG to redistribute throughout the distal axon. In support of an essential role for the distal cytoskeleton in ankG clustering, we also found that αII and βII-spectrin-deficient mice had disrupted AIS. Thus, the distal axonal cytoskeleton functions as an intra-axonal boundary restricting ankG to the AIS."

Recent exciting research has led not only to the end of the skepticism that proteins can transmit disease, but also to expanding the concept that transmissible proteins might be at the root of some of the most prevalent human illnesses. At the same time, the idea that biological information can be transmitted by propagation of protein (mis)folding raises the possibility that heritable protein agents may be operating as epigenetic factors in normal biological functions and participating in evolutionary adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2022745333,"Neuropathic pain is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by mechanical allodynia and spontaneous pain. Because symptoms are often unresponsive to conventional methods of pain treatment, new therapeutic approaches are essential. Here, we describe a strategy that not only ameliorates symptoms of neuropathic pain but is also potentially disease modifying. We show that transplantation of immature telencephalic GABAergic interneurons from the mouse medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) into the adult mouse spinal cord completely reverses the mechanical hypersensitivity produced by peripheral nerve injury. Underlying this improvement is a remarkable integration of the MGE transplants into the host spinal cord circuitry, in which the transplanted cells make functional connections with both primary afferent and spinal cord neurons. By contrast, MGE transplants were not effective against inflammatory pain. Our findings suggest that MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons overcome the spinal cord hyperexcitability that is a hallmark of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2088341873,"Neuronal excitation can be substantially modulated by alterations in metabolism, as evident from the anticonvulsant effect of diets that reduce glucose utilization and promote ketone body metabolism. We provide genetic evidence that BAD, a protein with dual functions in apoptosis and glucose metabolism, imparts reciprocal effects on metabolism of glucose and ketone bodies in brain cells. These effects involve phosphoregulation of BAD and are independent of its apoptotic function. BAD modifications that reduce glucose metabolism produce a marked increase in the activity of metabolically sensitive K(ATP) channels in neurons, as well as resistance to behavioral and electrographic seizures in vivo. Seizure resistance is reversed by genetic ablation of the K(ATP) channel, implicating the BAD-K(ATP) axis in metabolic control of neuronal excitation and seizure responses."
https://openalex.org/W2039403600,Neuropathic pain and allodynia may arise from sensitization of central circuits. We report a mechanism of disinhibition-based central sensitization resulting from long-term depression (LTD) of GABAergic interneurons as a consequence of TRPV1 activation in the spinal cord. Intrathecal administration of TRPV1 agonists led to mechanical allodynia that was not dependent on peripheral TRPV1 neurons. TRPV1 was functionally expressed in GABAergic spinal interneurons and activation of spinal TRPV1 resulted in LTD of excitatory inputs and a reduction of inhibitory signaling to spinothalamic tract (STT) projection neurons. Mechanical hypersensitivity after peripheral nerve injury was attenuated in TRPV1(-/-) mice but not in mice lacking TRPV1-expressing peripheral neurons. Mechanical pain was reversed by a spinally applied TRPV1 antagonist while avoiding the hyperthermic side effect of systemic treatment. Our results demonstrate that spinal TRPV1 plays a critical role as a synaptic regulator and suggest the utility of central nervous system-specific TRPV1 antagonists for treating neuropathic pain.

Functional imaging studies of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and anxiety indicate that a fundamental neural circuit controls emotion, with different elements of the circuit contributing to specific aspects of emotive behavior (Drevets et al., 2008Drevets W.C.

For example, fMRI and PET imaging of patients suffering from MDD has consistently demonstrated decreased prefrontal cortex function, and alterations in the activity of subcortical structures that include the basal ganglia, amygdala, and thalamus (Drevets, 2000Drevets W.C.

Psychiatry. 1999; 156: 675-682PubMed Google Scholar). There is general agreement that in MDD, disease and treatment mechanisms impact the same basic circuitry controlling emotional state. However, it is evident from deep brain stimulation studies in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders that the pathological mechanisms causing dysfunction and the immediate targets of clinical interventions most effective in alleviating symptoms may involve different brain structures. Given this realization, our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression as well as the development of improved therapies for this disorder will be advanced by identification of cell types and molecular mechanisms responsible for generating depression-like phenotypes, as well as those mediating responses to antidepressant treatment. Recently, p11 (the protein product of the S100a10 gene) was found to be an important factor mediating antidepressant responses and depression-like states (Svenningsson et al., 2006Svenningsson P. Chergui K. Rachleff I. Flajolet M. Zhang X. El Yacoubi M. Vaugeois J.M. Nomikos G.G. Greengard P. Alterations in 5-HT1B receptor function by p11 in depression-like states.Science. 2006; 311: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). P11 is an adaptor protein that is expressed specifically in the central nervous system (CNS) (Egeland et al., 2011Egeland M. Warner-Schmidt J. Greengard P. Svenningsson P. Co-expression of serotonin 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(4) receptors in p11 containing cells in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen and cerebellum.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It regulates serotonin signaling by binding to serotonin receptors (Htrs) 1b, 1d, and 4 and stabilizing the localization of these receptors at the cell surface (Svenningsson et al., 2006Svenningsson P.

Decreased p11 levels were found in the cortex of MDD patients, suicide victims, and a mouse model of depression (Anisman et al., 2008Anisman H. Du L. Palkovits M. Faludi G. Kovacs G.G.

Antidepressant drugs target neuromodulatory systems that have widespread effects throughout the CNS, engaging receptors that are broadly expressed in the brain. Although the pharmacological effect of these drugs is immediate, there is a therapeutic delay of weeks to months before antidepressant activity is evident. This delay is thought to reflect neuroadaptive changes in pre- and postsynaptic cells, including long-term changes in gene expression and protein translation (Krishnan and Nestler, 2008Krishnan V. Nestler E.J. The molecular neurobiology of depression.Nature. 2008; 455: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Although the cell types and precise molecular mechanisms mediating the efficacy of antidepressant drugs have not been identified, neuroimaging studies have shown that the clinical effects of antidepressant drug therapy and deep brain stimulation correlate with increased activity in the cerebral cortex (Drevets et al., 2008Drevets W.C.

Invest. 2009; 119: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Given these observations, and the dramatic regulation of p11 in the frontal cortex of depressed patients, we wished to determine whether p11-expressing cells in the cerebral cortex are critically important for antidepressant action, and to search for beneficial adaptations that may occur in these cells in response to chronic antidepressant treatment. For this study, we created an S100a10 bacTRAP mouse line to characterize p11-expressing cells and measure their responses to antidepressant treatment (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D.

We report that p11 is highly enriched in layer 5 corticostriatal (CStr) projection neurons, that these cells respond preferentially to chronic SSRI treatment by altering serotonergic tone, and that loss of p11 in the cortex results in the inability to respond to an SSRI. Our data demonstrate that the beneficial actions of antidepressant therapy can be mediated by a single cell type in the cerebral cortex, and suggest that development of drugs that specifically target the activity of CStr neurons can result in improved therapies for depression. Previous in situ hybridization (ISH) studies have shown that the S100a10 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R.

To identify this cell population and study its properties using the translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) approach, bacTRAP transgenic mice were generated using a BAC clone containing the S100a10 gene. The EGFP-L10a ribosomal protein fusion (Heiman et al., 2008Heiman M. Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A.

S100a10 bacTRAP founder line ES691 was chosen for further analysis because the pattern of transgene expression reliably recapitulated endogenous expression patterns of the S100a10 gene throughout the brain (Figure S1 available online).Figure S1EGFP-L10a Transgene Expression Matches Endogenous S100a10 Expression throughout Brain of S100a10 bacTRAP Transgenic Mouse Line, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) A comparison of S100a10 in situ hybridization (left side) and anti-EGFP immunohistochemistry (right side) in three representative brain sections that include frontal, motor, and sensory cortex.(B–H) Side-by-side comparison of high resolution S100a10 in situ hybridization images (left) and anti-EGFP immunocytochemistry (right) in a variety of sub-cortical structures including: granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb (B), large cell body interneurons in the striatum (C), colliculus, midbrain, and pons (D), thalamus, hypothalamus, and globus pallidus (E), superior and brainstem motor nuclei (F and G), and cervical spinal cord (H).

In the cortex, EGFP-L10a was expressed in a laminar pattern (Figures 1B and 1C and S1A), consistent with previous reports (Arlotta et al., 2005Arlotta P. Molyneaux B.J. Chen J. Inoue J. Kominami R.

Transgene expression was primarily restricted to superficial layer 5 (layer 5a), although a few cells with low levels of EGFP-L10a expression could be found in layers 4 and 5b. EGFP-L10a expression was localized to the soma, proximal dendrites, and the nucleolus, as previously described for other bacTRAP mouse lines (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D. Heiman M. Schmidt E.F. Stevens T.R. Ma G. Bupp S. Shrestha P. Shah R.D.

At high magnification, it was evident that somas of EGFP-L10a+ cells were pyramidal, with a clear apical dendrite (Figure 1D). As shown in Figure 1E, all EGFP+ cells were also labeled with anti-p11, and the vast majority of p11+ cells also expressed the fusion protein. These results confirm previous studies demonstrating laminar expression of the S100a10 gene in the cortex, identify these cells as layer 5a pyramidal cells, and demonstrate that the ES691 bacTRAP transgenic line faithfully reproduces expression of endogenous S100a10 in the mouse cortex. Inspection of an S100a10 EGFP transgenic reporter line (http://www.gensat.org) revealed axons within the corpus callosum and striatum, and no labeling in the thalamus or pyramidal tract, suggesting that the S100a10-expressing cells project primarily to the striatum. To determine definitively the axonal targets of the pyramidal cells labeled in the S100a10 bacTRAP line, retrograde tracing experiments were performed using fluorescently-tagged cholera toxin β subunit (CTβ). These studies demonstrate that pyramidal cells labeled in the S100a10 bacTRAP line provide a major afferent input to the dorsal striatum (caudate putamen [CPu]). Thus, 72 ± 5% of the cortical neurons labeled by injecting CTβ into CPu were also EGFP-L10a+ (Figures 2A and 2C ). Injections into different areas of the CPu resulted in labeling of S100a10 neurons in diverse areas of cortex, reflecting the topographic map of CStr projections (Figure S2D ). A large proportion of cells that were double positive for CTβ and EGFP-L10a were also found in contralateral cortex following injections into CPu (Figure 2C), indicating that the S100a10 cells are capable of making both ipsilateral and contralateral projections to the dorsal striatum. The laminar distribution of EGFP-L10a+ and CTβ+ substantially overlapped (Figure 2B), consistent with previous studies demonstrating that a majority of striatally projecting cortical neurons are present in layer 5a.Figure S2Retrograde Labeling in S100a10 bacTRAP Line, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Representative low magnification immunofluorescent images of injection sites for CPu (left), NAcc (center), and contralateral cortex (right).

Because the CPu and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are known to be functionally distinct, and because the majority of cortical inputs to the NAc arise from medial prefrontal cortical areas, we employed CTβ retrograde tracing to ask whether S100a10-expressing neurons project to the ventral striatum. Although CTβ- and EGFP-L10a-labeled cell bodies were intermingled in frontal cortex, there was minimal overlap between accumbal projecting neurons and S100a10 cells (1.9 ± 1.7% ipsilaterally and 3.9 ± 1.4% contralaterally; Figures 2A and 2C). Rather, medial prefrontal S100a10 cells colabeled with injections to anteromedial CPu whereas those in lateral regions sent projections primarily to anterolateral CPu (Figure S2 and data not shown). We conclude that the major afferent input from the cortex to the CPu originates in S100a10-expressing pyramidal cells, but that direct projections from the frontal cortex to the NAc do not arise from this cell population. As it is common for CStr neurons to send collateral projections to contralateral cortex, we examined whether this was the case for S100a10 cells. When CTβ was injected into somatosensory cortex, CTβ+ commissural projecting neurons (CPNs) were widely distributed across the cortex and showed no laminar patterning (Figures 2A and 2B). However, we found that 66 ± 8% of CTβ+ cells in layer 5 of contralateral cortex were also EGFP+ (Figure 2C). Although we cannot definitively conclude that individual S100a10-expressing neurons that project to the striatum also send collaterals to contralateral cortex, strong support for this suggestion comes from the fact that the majority of layer 5 cells labeled by retrograde tracing with CTβ from either the dorsal striatum or the contralateral cortex are EGFP-L10a+. Finally, we note that retrograde tracing from the cervical spinal cord revealed little overlap between corticospinal tract (CST) projection neurons in layer 5b and S100a10-expressing cells (Figures 2B and S2B), despite the fact that long distance projection neurons of this class are known to send axon collaterals to the striatum. Taken together, our results demonstrate that S100a10-expressing pyramidal cells constitute a major class of layer 5 neurons whose projections are limited to forebrain structures (Figure 2D). The fact that these neurons send afferents specifically to medial and lateral CPu, and that they do not provide inputs to the NAc, is interesting given the concept of multiple, parallel, and functionally segregated pathways from the cerebral cortex to the striatum that has emerged from rodent and primate neuroanatomical studies over the last several decades (Voorn et al., 2004Voorn P.

To compare the molecular properties of a second well characterized pyramidal cell type to the S100a10 CStr cell population, we chose Glt25d2-expressing corticopontine neurons. Glt25d2-expressing pyramidal cells are long-distance projection neurons that reside in layer 5b and send axons to pons, thalamus, and spinal cord (Doyle et al., 2008Doyle J.P. Dougherty J.D.

Glt25d2 cells are present deeper in layer 5 than S100a10 neurons in multiple areas of cortex and cell somas of Glt25d2 cells are larger than those of S100a10 cells (Figure S3), consistent with previous observations (Groh et al., 2010Groh A.

To identify molecular distinctions between S100a10 and Glt25d2-expressing cells, we isolated polysome-bound mRNA from these cell types and assayed global differences in gene expression using microarrays. Because the S100a10 gene and the corresponding EGFP-L10a bacTRAP construct are also expressed in the pia mater and some blood vessels in the brain (Figures S4A–S4D ), we limited our analysis to a subset of 12,235 probe sets (representing 8,390 genes) that are expressed specifically in neurons (Table S1). As shown in Figure 3A , comparative analysis of mRNAs immunoprecipitated (IP) from S100a10 cells versus those present in the whole cortex (input) demonstrates selective enrichment of S100a10 probe sets in the IP (7.5- and 5.9-fold). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) of TRAP RNA showed that mRNA for the vesicular glutamate transporter, Slc17a7, was expressed (although not enriched compared to neighboring cells), confirming that the S100a10 cells are indeed excitatory neurons (Figure 3B).

It is widely believed that development stabilizes the synapses from thalamus to cortex and that adult experience alters only synaptic connections between cortical neurons. Here we show that thalamocortical (TC) inputs themselves undergo massive plasticity in adults. We combined whole-cell recording from individual thalamocortical neurons in adult rats with a recently developed automatic tracing technique to reconstruct individual axonal trees. Whisker trimming substantially reduced thalamocortical axon length in barrel cortex but not the density of TC synapses along a fiber. Thus, sensory experience alters the total number of TC synapses. After trimming, sensory stimulation evoked more tightly time-locked responses among thalamorecipient layer 4 cortical neurons. These findings indicate that thalamocortical input itself remains plastic in adulthood, raising the possibility that the axons of other subcortical structures might also remain in flux throughout life."
https://openalex.org/W2082612814,"At the optic chiasm, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project ipsi- or contralaterally to establish the circuitry for binocular vision. Ipsilateral guidance programs have been characterized, but contralateral guidance programs are not well understood. Here, we identify a tripartite molecular system for contralateral RGC projections: Semaphorin6D (Sema6D) and Nr-CAM are expressed on midline radial glia and Plexin-A1 on chiasm neurons, and Plexin-A1 and Nr-CAM are also expressed on contralateral RGCs. Sema6D is repulsive to contralateral RGCs, but Sema6D in combination with Nr-CAM and Plexin-A1 converts repulsion to growth promotion. Nr-CAM functions as a receptor for Sema6D. Sema6D, Plexin-A1, and Nr-CAM are all required for efficient RGC decussation at the optic chiasm. These findings suggest a mechanism by which a complex of Sema6D, Nr-CAM, and Plexin-A1 at the chiasm midline alters the sign of Sema6D and signals Nr-CAM/Plexin-A1 receptors on RGCs to implement the contralateral RGC projection."

To identify early populations of committed progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we screened self-renewing, BMP4-treated and retinoic acid–treated cultures with >400 antibodies recognizing cell-surface antigens. Sorting of >30 subpopulations followed by transcriptional analysis of developmental genes identified four distinct candidate progenitor groups. Subsets detected in self-renewing cultures, including CXCR4+ cells, expressed primitive endoderm genes. Expression of Cxcr4 in primitive endoderm was confirmed in visceral endoderm of mouse embryos. BMP4-induced progenitors exhibited gene signatures of mesoderm, trophoblast and vascular endothelium, suggesting correspondence to gastrulation-stage primitive streak, chorion and allantois precursors, respectively. Functional studies in vitro and in vivo confirmed that ROR2+ cells produce mesoderm progeny, APA+ cells generate syncytiotrophoblasts and CD87+ cells give rise to vasculature. The same progenitor classes emerged during the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

Given the potential role of PNPLA3 in fatty liver development, we aimed to explore whether the influence of PNPLA3 genotype on hepatic fat in obese youth might be modulated by dietary factors such as essential omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake.We studied 127 children and adolescents (56 boys, 71 girls; 58 Caucasians; 30 African Americans and 39 Hispanics; mean age 14.7±3.3; mean BMI 30.7±7.2). The dietary composition was assessed by the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R version 2011). The patients underwent a MRI study to assess the liver fat content (HFF%), ALT measurement and the genotyping of the rs738409 SNP by automatic sequencing.As previously observed, HFF% and ALT levels varied according to the genotype in each ethnicity. ALT levels and HFF% were significantly influenced by the interaction between genotype and omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio (n-6/n-3), p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively. HFF% and ALT levels were, in fact, related to the n-6/n-3 consumption only in subjects homozygote for the G allele of the rs738409 (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.001 and r2 = 0.40, p = 0.006, respectively).These findings suggest that the association of a high dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA with fatty liver and liver damage in obese youths may be driven by a predisposing genotype."
https://openalex.org/W2079475614,"Background The retina is a light-sensitive tissue lining the inner surface of the eye and one of the few human organs whose cholesterol maintenance is still poorly understood. Challenges in studies of the retina include its complex multicellular and multilayered structure; unique cell types and functions; and specific physico-chemical environment. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated specimens of the neural retina (NR) and underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid from six deceased human donors and evaluated them for expression of genes and proteins representing the major pathways of cholesterol input, output and regulation. Eighty-four genes were studied by PCR array, 16 genes were assessed by quantitative real time PCR, and 13 proteins were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Cholesterol distribution among different retinal layers was analyzed as well by histochemical staining with filipin. Our major findings pertain to two adjacent retinal layers: the photoreceptor outer segments of NR and the RPE. We demonstrate that in the photoreceptor outer segments, cholesterol biosynthesis, catabolism and regulation via LXR and SREBP are weak or absent and cholesterol content is the lowest of all retinal layers. Cholesterol maintenance in the RPE is different, yet the gene expression also does not appear to be regulated by the SREBPs and varies significantly among different individuals. Conclusions/Significance This comprehensive investigation provides important insights into the relationship and spatial distribution of different pathways of cholesterol input, output and regulation in the NR-RPE region. The data obtained are important for deciphering the putative link between cholesterol and age-related macular degeneration, a major cause of irreversible vision loss in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2117291237,"Contingency, the persistent influence of past random events, pervades biology. To what extent, then, is each course of ecological or evolutionary dynamics unique, and to what extent are these dynamics subject to a common statistical structure? Addressing this question requires replicate measurements to search for emergent statistical laws. We establish a readily replicated microbial closed ecosystem (CES), sustaining its three species for years. We precisely measure the local population density of each species in many CES replicates, started from the same initial conditions and kept under constant light and temperature. The covariation among replicates of the three species densities acquires a stable structure, which could be decomposed into discrete eigenvectors, or “ecomodes.” The largest ecomode dominates population density fluctuations around the replicate-average dynamics. These fluctuations follow simple power laws consistent with a geometric random walk. Thus, variability in ecological dynamics can be studied with CES replicates and described by simple statistical laws."

Urinary concentrations of CCL18, PAI-1, and BTA were significantly elevated in subjects with BCa. CCL18 was the most accurate biomarker (AUC; 0.919; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8704-0.9674). Multivariate regression analysis highlighted CCL18 (OR; 18.31; 95% CI, 4.95-67.70, p<0.0001) and BTA (OR; 6.43; 95% CI, 1.86-22.21, p = 0.0033) as independent predictors of BCa in voided urine samples. The combination of CCL18, PAI-1 and CD44 improved the area under the curve to 0.938. Preliminary results indicate that CCL18 was a highly accurate biomarker for BCa detection in this cohort. Monitoring CCL18 in voided urine samples has the potential to improve non-invasive tests for BCa diagnosis. Furthermore using the combination of CCL18, PAI-1 and CD44 may make the model more robust to errors to detect BCa over the individual biomarkers or BTA."

Here, plasticity induced by unilateral infraorbital (IO) nerve resection in 4-week-old rats was mapped using MRI and synaptic mechanisms were elucidated by slice electrophysiology. Functional MRI demonstrates a cortical potentiation compared to thalamus 2 weeks after IO nerve resection. Tracing thalamocortical (TC) projections with manganese-enhanced MRI revealed circuit changes in the spared layer 4 (L4) barrel cortex. Brain slice electrophysiology revealed TC input strengthening onto L4 stellate cells due to an increase in postsynaptic strength and the number of functional synapses. This work shows that the TC input is a site for robust plasticity after the end of the previously defined critical period for this input. Thus, TC inputs may represent a major site for adult plasticity in contrast to the consensus that adult plasticity mainly occurs at cortico-cortical connections."
https://openalex.org/W2003330837,"This study examined fiber type-dependent differences in the regulation of protein synthesis in individual muscle fibers found within the same whole muscle. Specifically, the in vivo SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) methodology was used to measure protein synthesis in type 1, 2A, 2X and 2B fibers of the mouse plantaris muscle, in response to food deprivation (FD), and mechanical overload induced by synergist ablation (SA). The results show that 48 h of FD induced a greater decrease in protein synthesis in type 2X and 2B fibers compared to type 1 and 2A fibers. Type 2X and 2B fibers also had the largest FD-induced decrease in total S6 protein and Ser240/244 S6 phosphorylation, respectively. Moreover, only type 2X and 2B fibers displayed a FD-induced decrease in cross-sectional area (CSA). Ten days of SA also induced fiber type-dependent responses, with type 2B fibers having the smallest SA-induced increases in protein synthesis, CSA and Ser240/244 S6 phosphorylation, but the largest increase in total S6 protein. Embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHCEmb) positive fibers were also found in SA muscles and the protein synthesis rates, levels of S6 Ser240/244 phosphorylation, and total S6 protein content, were 3.6-, 6.1- and 2.9-fold greater than that found in fibers from control muscles, respectively. Overall, these results reveal differential responses in the regulation of protein synthesis and fiber size between fiber types found within the same whole muscle. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that changes found at the whole muscle level do not necessarily reflect changes in individual fiber types."
https://openalex.org/W2007884363,"Circadian rhythms offer an excellent opportunity to dissect the neural circuits underlying innate behavior because the genes and neurons involved are relatively well understood. We first sought to understand how Drosophila clock neurons interact in the simple circuit that generates circadian rhythms in larval light avoidance. We used genetics to manipulate two groups of clock neurons, increasing or reducing excitability, stopping their molecular clocks, and blocking neurotransmitter release and reception. Our results revealed that lateral neurons (LN(v)s) promote and dorsal clock neurons (DN(1)s) inhibit light avoidance, these neurons probably signal at different times of day, and both signals are required for rhythmic behavior. We found that similar principles apply in the more complex adult circadian circuit that generates locomotor rhythms. Thus, the changing balance in activity between clock neurons with opposing behavioral effects generates robust circadian behavior and probably helps organisms transition between discrete behavioral states, such as sleep and wakefulness."
https://openalex.org/W2013935630,"Between 2005 and 2009, we deployed 58 miniature pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and 132 implanted archival tags on juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna (age 2-5) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Data returned from these efforts (n = 26 PSATs, 1 archival tag) revealed their dispersal routes, horizontal and vertical movements and habitat utilization. All of the tagged bluefin tuna remained in the northwest Atlantic for the duration observed, and in summer months exhibited core-use of coastal seas extending from Maryland to Cape Cod, MA, (USA) out to the shelf break. Their winter distributions were more spatially disaggregated, ranging south to the South Atlantic Bight, northern Bahamas and Gulf Stream. Vertical habitat patterns showed that juvenile bluefin tuna mainly occupied shallow depths (mean= 5-12 m, sd = 15-23.7 m) and relatively warm water masses in summer (mean= 17.9-20.9°C, sd= 4.2-2.6°C) and had deeper and more variable depth patterns in winter (mean= 41-58 m, sd= 48.9-62.2 m). Our tagging results reveal annual dispersal patterns, behavior and oceanographic associations of juvenile Atlantic bluefin tuna that were only surmised in earlier studies. Fishery independent profiling from electronic tagging also provide spatially and temporally explicit information for evaluating dispersals rates, population structure and fisheries catch patterns."

Most cell types and pathways depicted correspond to published work on human cells, except for the production of spermatozoa, oocyte-like cells, otic hair cells, cortical layers, and optic cup, which were generated with mouse ESCs or iPSCs.In order to uncover these differentiation strategies, stem cell biologists have relied heavily on previous research in model organisms, including"
https://openalex.org/W1968479074,"Functional neuroimaging studies show that perceptual judgments about time and space activate similar prefrontal and parietal areas, and it is known that perceptions in these two cognitive domains interfere with each other. These findings have led to the theory that temporal and spatial perceptions, among other metrics, draw on a common representation of magnitude. Our results indicate that an alternative principle applies to the prefrontal cortex. Analysis at the single-cell level shows that separate, domain-specific populations of neurons encode relative magnitude in time and space. These neurons are intermixed with each other in the prefrontal cortex, along with a separate intermixed population that encodes the goal chosen on the basis of these perceptual decisions. As a result, domain-specific neural processing at the single-cell level seems to underlie domain generality as observed at the regional level, with a common representation of prospective goals rather than a common representation of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2045474213,"Cell migration is of paramount importance to organism development and maintenance as well as multiple pathological processes, including cancer metastasis. The RhoGTPases Rac1 and RhoA are indispensable for cell migration as they regulate cell protrusion, cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and force transduction. However, the consequences of their activity at a molecular level within the cell remain undetermined. Using a combination of FRET, FRAP and biochemical analyses we show that the interactions between the focal adhesion proteins vinculin and paxillin, as well as the closely related family member Hic-5 are spatially and reciprocally regulated by the activity of Rac1 and RhoA. Vinculin in its active conformation interacts with either paxillin or Hic-5 in adhesions in response to Rac1 and RhoA activation respectively, while inactive vinculin interacts with paxillin in the membrane following Rac1 inhibition. Additionally, Rac1 specifically regulates the dynamics of paxillin as well as its binding partner and F-actin interacting protein actopaxin (α-parvin) in adhesions. Furthermore, FRET analysis of protein:protein interactions within cell adhesions formed in 3D matrices revealed that, in contrast to 2D systems vinculin interacts preferentially with Hic-5. This study provides new insight into the complexity of cell-ECM adhesions in both 2D and 3D matrices by providing the first description of RhoGTPase-coordinated protein:protein interactions in a cellular microenvironment. These data identify discrete roles for paxillin and Hic-5 in Rac1 and RhoA-dependent cell adhesion formation and maturation; processes essential for productive cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2022509150,"Background Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been suggested as an efficient clinical approach for the treatment of dental plaque in the field of dental care. In PDT, once the photosensitizer is irradiated with light of a specific wavelength, it transfers the excitation energy to molecular oxygen, which gives rise to singlet oxygen. Methodology/Principal Findings Since plaque disclosing agents usually contain photosensitizers such as rose bengal, erythrosine, and phloxine, they could be used for PTD upon photoactivation. The aim of the present study is to compare the ability of these three photosensitizers to produce singlet oxygen in relation to their bactericidal activity. The generation rates of singlet oxygen determined by applying an electron spin resonance technique were in the order phloxine > erythrosine ≒ rose bengal. On the other hand, rose bengal showed the highest bactericidal activity against Streptococcus mutans, a major causative pathogen of caries, followed by erythrosine and phloxine, both of which showed activity similar to each other. One of the reasons for the discrepancy between the singlet oxygen generating ability and bactericidal activity was the incorporation efficiency of the photosensitizers into the bacterial cells. The incorporation rate of rose bengal was the highest among the three photosensitizers examined in the present study, likely leading to the highest bactericidal activity. Meanwhile, the addition of L-histidine, a singlet oxygen quencher, cancelled the bactericidal activity of any of the three photoactivated photosensitizers, proving that singlet oxygen was responsible for the bactericidal action. Conclusions It is strongly suggested that rose bengal is a suitable photosensitizer for the plaque disclosing agents as compared to the other two photosensitizers, phloxine and erythrosine, when used for PDT."

The present study is aimed to investigate the epidemiology of HAIs caused by CRAB and the association of CRAB infection and hospital usage of different antimicrobials.Two nationwide databases in the period 2003 to 2008, the Taiwan Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System and National Health Insurance claim data, were used for analysis. A total of 13,811 healthcare-associated A. baumannii infections and antimicrobial usage data from 121 hospitals were analyzed.There was a significant increase in the proportion of number of HAIs caused by CRAB over that by all A. baumannii (CRABpAB), from 14% in 2003 to 46% in 2008 (P<0.0001). The greatest increase was in central Taiwan, from 4% in 2003 to 62% in 2008 (P<0.0001). Use of anti-pseudomonal carbapenems, but not other classes of antibiotics, was significantly correlated with the increase of CRABpAB (r = 0.86, P<0.0001).We suggested that dedicated use of anti-pseudomonal carbapenems would be an important intervention to control the increase of CRABpAB."
https://openalex.org/W2077035433,"How complex signaling networks shape highly coordinated, multistep cellular responses is poorly understood. Here, we made use of a network-perturbation approach to investigate causal influences, or “crosstalk,” among signaling modules involved in the cytoskeletal response of neutrophils to chemoattractant. We quantified the intensity and polarity of cytoskeletal marker proteins over time to characterize stereotyped cellular responses. Analyzing the effects of network disruptions revealed that, not only does crosstalk evolve rapidly during polarization, but also that intensity and polarity responses are influenced by different patterns of crosstalk. Interestingly, persistent crosstalk is arranged in a surprisingly simple circuit: a linear cascade from front to back to microtubules influences intensities, and a feed-forward network in the reverse direction influences polarity. Our approach provided a rational strategy for decomposing a complex, dynamically evolving signaling system and revealed evolving paths of causal influence that shape the neutrophil polarization response."
https://openalex.org/W2128255086,"Background Elevated cholesterol levels in children can be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in later life. In adults, it has been shown that blood lipid levels are strongly influenced by polymorphisms in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster in addition to nutritional and other exogenous and endogenous determinants. Our aim was to investigate whether lipid levels are determined by the FADS genotype already in children and whether this association interacts with dietary intake of n-3 fatty acids. Methods The analysis was based on data of 2006 children from two German prospective birth cohort studies. Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides were measured at 10 years of age. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the FADS gene cluster were genotyped. Dietary n-3 fatty acid intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Linear regression modeling was used to assess the association between lipid levels, n-3 fatty acid intake and FADS genotype. Results Individuals carrying the homozygous minor allele had lower levels of total cholesterol [means ratio (MR) ranging from 0.96 (p = 0.0093) to 0.98 (p = 0.2949), depending on SNPs] and LDL [MR between 0.94 (p = 0.0179) and 0.97 (p = 0.2963)] compared to homozygous major allele carriers. Carriers of the heterozygous allele showed lower HDL levels [β between −0.04 (p = 0.0074) to −0.01 (p = 0.3318)] and higher triglyceride levels [MR ranging from 1.06 (p = 0.0065) to 1.07 (p = 0.0028)] compared to homozygous major allele carriers. A higher n-3 PUFA intake was associated with higher concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and lower triglyceride levels, but these associations did not interact with the FADS1 FADS2 genotype. Conclusion Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride concentrations may be influenced by the FADS1 FADS2 genotype already in 10 year old children. Genetically determined blood lipid levels during childhood might differentially predispose individuals to the development of cardiovascular diseases later in life."
https://openalex.org/W1982111738,"Frequent treatment of the growth-restricted (IUGR) ovine fetus with intra-amniotic IGF-1 increases fetal growth. We aimed to determine whether increased growth was maintained with an extended dosing interval and to examine possible mechanisms. Pregnant ewes were allocated to three groups: Control, and two IUGR groups (induced by placental embolization) treated with weekly intra-amniotic injections of either saline (IUGR) or 360 µg IGF-1 (IGF1). IUGR fetuses were hypoxic, hyperuremic, hypoglycemic, and grew more slowly than controls. Placental glucose uptake and SLC2A1 (GLUT2) mRNA levels decreased in IUGR fetuses, but SLC2A3 (GLUT3) and SLC2A4 (GLUT4) levels were unaffected. IGF-1 treatment increased fetal growth rate, did not alter uterine blood flow or placental glucose uptake, and increased placental SLC2A1 and SLC2A4 (but not SLC2A3) mRNA levels compared with saline-treated IUGR animals. Following IGF-1 treatment, placental mRNA levels of isoforms of the system A, y(+), and L amino acid transporters increased 1.3 to 5.0 fold, while the ratio of phosphorylated-mTOR to total mTOR also tended to increase. Weekly intra-amniotic IGF-1 treatment provides a promising avenue for intra-uterine treatment of IUGR babies, and may act via increased fetal substrate supply, up-regulating placental transporters for neutral, cationic, and branched-chain amino acids, possibly via increased activation of the mTOR pathway."

In both cases, this strategy revealed mnemonic signals not previously observed in the other species. Monkey and human subjects performed a conditional motor associative learning task in which they learned to match one of four target locations presented on a computer screen with novel complex visual stimuli for either juice reward (monkeys; Figure 1A ) or positive feedback (humans; Figure 1B). Highly familiar “reference” stimulus-target associations were also randomly presented throughout the task. Trials started with subjects briefly fixating a central point before the stimulus and targets appeared. After 500 ms, the stimulus disappeared, leaving the targets on the screen for a 700 ms delay period. The subjects were then cued to respond with either an eye movement (monkeys) or a touch response (humans) to one of the possible targets. Correct responses were followed immediately by either juice reward or positive feedback. The start of the next trial was preceded by an inter-trial-interval (ITI). Before each new learning session, monkeys performed a “fixation only” task during which the novel complex visual stimuli to be presented during the learning trials for that day were shown. Animals received juice reward simply for maintaining fixation during the stimulus presentation. For similar baseline purposes, human subjects performed a challenging, non-mnemonic, perceptual baseline condition randomly interspersed throughout learning. Monkeys A and B were given between two to four or one to two new visuomotor associations to learn concurrently in each recording session, respectively. Thirty-one human subjects were tested with 4, 8, or 12 visuomotor associations run concurrently, dependent on individual performance during a prescan training session. The total number of associations presented in each session varied across human subjects as new associations would replace learned associations during training (after greater than six correct responses in a row). To characterize the behavioral learning of visuomotor associations in both species, we used a logistic regression algorithm (Smith et al., 2004Smith A.C. Frank L.M. Wirth S. Yanike M. Hu D. Kubota Y. Graybiel A.M. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Dynamic analysis of learning in behavioral experiments.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) to generate learning curves based on binary responses (Law et al., 2005Law J.R. Flanery M.A. Wirth S. Yanike M. Smith A.C. Frank L.M. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Stark C.E. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during the gradual acquisition and expression of paired-associate memory.J.

Single neurons in the monkey hippocampus and learning of new associations.Science. 2003; 300: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Typical learning curves consisted of a variable number of predominantly incorrect responses, followed by a sharp transition to predominantly correct responses. Associations were considered learned once the lower bound 95% confidence interval of the logistic regression became greater than would be expected by chance. The trial on which the learning passed this criterion was considered the “learning trial.” An analysis of the learning trial indicated that the curves initially presented within a set could be ordered, identifying “fast,” “medium,” and “slow” learned conditions, a pattern observed both in monkeys (F(3,21) = 17.92; p < 0.001) and humans (F(3,87) = 34.91; p < 0.0005) that was linear in nature (F(1,36) = 115.97; p < 0.0005). A similar analysis of the maximum learning curve slopes reinforced the idea that the curves could be ordered linearly (F(1,36) = 52.45; p < 0.0005). Overall, the pattern suggests that a common strategy was adopted by both monkeys and humans during which only one association was “worked on” at a time (Hadj-Bouziane and Boussaoud, 2003Hadj-Bouziane F. Boussaoud D. Neuronal activity in the monkey striatum during conditional visuomotor learning.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 153: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the overall learning strategy appeared remarkably similar across species, not surprisingly, both the speed of learning and number of learned associations were superior in humans compared to monkeys. Human subjects had steeper learning curves than monkeys, as evidenced by differences in the average maximum slope of learned visuomotor associations (t(125) = 13.81; p < 0.0001) and a smaller number trials to criterion (Humans: mean 4.67, range 2–28, SEM 0.68; Monkeys: mean 17.14, range 2–39, SEM 0.69; t(30) = 5.483; p < 0.0001). As a consequence, humans learned significantly more associations per session than monkeys (monkeys = 1.73, humans = 20.26; t(30) = 13.64; p < 0.0001). Of the 152 visuomotor associations presented during the 74 recording sessions, monkeys learned a total of 56.56% (86) associations. Conversely, of the 924 stimulus-location associations presented in 31 scanning sessions, human subjects learned a total of 67.96% (628) associations. Thus, overall, humans also learned a significantly greater percentage of conditions than did the monkeys (χ2(1) = 7.58; p < 0.01). To identify homologies between the neurophysiological responses in the monkeys and human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during the performance of the same behavioral task, we measured LFP recordings from two monkeys (Figures 1C and 1D) and BOLD fMRI from 31 human subjects focused on these two regions (Goense and Logothetis, 2008Goense J.B.

The BOLD activity was analyzed with a traditional general linear model (GLM) approach using multiple linear regression to estimate β weights that correspond to activity for each trial type of interest relative to a perceptual baseline condition (Kirwan et al., 2007Kirwan C.B.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during the gradual acquisition and expression of paired-associate memory.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5720-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We analyzed the monkey LFP data using the same multiple linear regression β weight analysis used on the human BOLD fMRI signals, examining nonoverlapping frequency bandwidths in the gamma (30–100 Hz) and beta (10–25 Hz) ranges derived from spectral analyses (Figures S1A and S1B available online). In some cases where there was not enough data available to carry out a multiple regression analysis, we used standard parametric statistics to analyze the LFP data. The results of each analysis were compared across species to identify similarities as well as differences in the neurophysiological responses. A common finding from the monkey entorhinal cortex has been strong responses to relatively novel stimuli (stimuli seen for the first time in the current session) compared to highly familiar stimuli (significant exposure over multiple days to months) (Brown et al., 1987Brown M.W. Wilson F.A.W. Riches I.P.

Differential neuronal encoding of novelty, familiarity and recency in regions of the anterior temporal lobe.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Few if any such signals have been reported in the hippocampus (Brown et al., 1987Brown M.W. Wilson F.A.W. Riches I.P. Neuronal evidence that inferomedial temporal cortex is more important than hippocampus in certain processes underlying recognition memory.Brain Res. 1987; 409: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, Xiang and Brown, 1998Xiang J.Z. Brown M.W. Differential neuronal encoding of novelty, familiarity and recency in regions of the anterior temporal lobe.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We first asked whether differences in responses to new versus highly familiar stimuli could be found in the monkey LFP signals. LFP sweeps were converted to frequency spectra and the mean log power from both the beta and gamma bandwidths of a 1,100 ms epoch spanning the scene and delay periods were derived. The spectral power values from the selected bandwidths were then analyzed with multiple regressions for each session to generate β values for both the new and the highly familiar reference stimuli. These β values were then compared across sessions using parametric tests. For the monkey entorhinal cortex, significant differences between new and reference β values were found for the beta bandwidth (t(52) = 5.69; p < 0.0005), but not the gamma bandwidth (t(52) = 0.323; p = ns; Figure 2A ). The direction of the effect in the beta bandwidth favored reference over new trial spectra. During separate recording sessions in the monkey hippocampus, significant differences in β values were found for both the beta (t(39) = 3.15; p < 0.003) and the gamma (t(39) = 2.35; p < 0.024) bandwidths. Additional analyses done to examine the detailed structure of signal showed that the differential signals we observed arose from a transient decrease during the scene/delay period relative to the fixation period that was larger (more negative) for the new conditions than for the reference conditions (Figures S1C–S1F). In humans, we applied a multiple regression analysis of the fMRI data calculating coefficients for the new and reference trial responses for each subject. The β values reflected the difference in activity between mnemonic and non-mnemonic tasks for each voxel. To parallel the LFP monkey data, we used an anatomically-defined region of interest (ROI) approach, hand-segmenting the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus for each subject. These segmentations, collapsed across hemispheres, were used to assess average activity within each region. The resulting estimates of activity (mean β values) were then subjected to group analyses to determine whether the novelty of the trial reliably affected the fMRI signal in these regions. Results indicated a significant difference for the hippocampal ROI (t(30) = 3.46; p < 0.0017; Figure 2D) and a trend toward significance for the entorhinal ROI (t(30) = 2.0; p = 0.055), as depicted in Figure 2C. The direction of the differences for the hippocampal and entorhinal ROIs both favored the reference trials over the new trials. Thus, parallel signals of relative stimulus novelty/familiarity are seen in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus of both monkeys and humans. One of the more prominent findings in the human fMRI study of Law et al., 2005Law J.R. Flanery M.A. Wirth S. Yanike M. Smith A.C. Frank L.M. Suzuki W.A. Brown E.N. Stark C.E. Functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during the gradual acquisition and expression of paired-associate memory.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5720-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar was an immediate novelty effect in which the initial presentation of new stimuli was followed by a drop in BOLD activity on successive presentations. This immediate novelty effect is common in the neuroimaging literature and is thought to provide a novelty detection signal (Schacter and Wagner, 1999Schacter D.L. Wagner A.D. Medial temporal lobe activations in fMRI and PET studies of episodic encoding and retrieval.Hippocampus. 1999; 9: 7-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). When the human fMRI data were reanalyzed using the methods here, the results were consistent with the original Law et al., 2005Law J.R. Flanery M.A. Wirth S. Yanike M. Smith A.C. Frank L.M.

One difference between the monkey and human testing was that although the humans saw the novel visual images for the first time during the associative learning task, the monkeys were habituated to the novel visual images for 15–20 trials of simple fixation before the learning trials started. Because these fixation trials were the very first time the animals saw these novel stimuli, we focused our analysis on these trials.

https://openalex.org/W2052393634,"Alcoholism is a devastating brain disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The development of alcoholism is caused by alcohol-induced maladaptive changes in neural circuits involved in emotions, motivation, and decision-making. Because of its involvement in these processes, the amygdala is thought to be a key neural structure involved in alcohol addiction. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the development of alcoholism are incompletely understood. We have previously shown that in a limited access choice paradigm, C57BL/6J mice progressively escalate their alcohol intake and display important behavioral characteristic of alcohol addiction, in that they become insensitive to quinine-induced adulteration of alcohol. This study used the limited access choice paradigm to study gene expression changes in the amygdala during the escalation to high alcohol consumption in C57BL/6J mice. Microarray analysis revealed that changes in gene expression occurred predominantly after one week, i.e. during the initial escalation of alcohol intake. One gene that stood out from our analysis was the adapter protein 14-3-3ζ, which was up-regulated during the transition from low to high alcohol intake. Independent qPCR analysis confirmed the up-regulation of amygdala 14-3-3ζ during the escalation of alcohol intake. Subsequently, we found that local knockdown of 14-3-3ζ in the amygdala, using RNA interference, dramatically augmented alcohol intake. In addition, knockdown of amygdala 14-3-3ζ promoted the development of inflexible alcohol drinking, as apparent from insensitivity to quinine adulteration of alcohol. This study identifies amygdala 14-3-3ζ as a novel key modulator that is engaged during escalation of alcohol use."
https://openalex.org/W2061379821,"Background The current practice in newborn medicine is to subjectively assess when a premature infant is ready to feed by mouth. When the assessment is inaccurate, the resulting feeding morbidities may be significant, resulting in long-term health consequences and millions of health care dollars annually. We hypothesized that the developmental maturation of hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior is a predictor of successful oral feeding in the premature infant. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the gene expression of neuropeptide Y2 receptor (NPY2R), a known hypothalamic regulator of feeding behavior, in neonatal saliva to determine its role as a biomarker in predicting oral feeding success in the neonate. Methodology/Principal Findings Salivary samples (n = 116), were prospectively collected from 63 preterm and 13 term neonates (post-conceptual age (PCA) 26 4/7 to 41 4/7 weeks) from five predefined feeding stages. Expression of NPY2R in neonatal saliva was determined by multiplex RT-qPCR amplification. Expression results were retrospectively correlated with feeding status at time of sample collection. Statistical analysis revealed that expression of NPY2R had a 95% positive predictive value for feeding immaturity. NPY2R expression statistically significantly decreased with advancing PCA (Wilcoxon test p value<0.01), and was associated with feeding status (chi square p value = 0.013). Conclusions/Significance Developmental maturation of hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior is an essential component of oral feeding success in the newborn. NPY2R expression in neonatal saliva is predictive of an immature feeding pattern. It is a clinically relevant biomarker that may be monitored in saliva to improve clinical care and reduce significant feeding-associated morbidities that affect the premature neonate."
https://openalex.org/W2018078485,"Retinal melatonin is involved in the modulation of many important retinal functions. Our previous studies have shown that the viability of photoreceptors and ganglion cells is reduced during aging in mice that lack melatonin receptor type 1. This demonstrates that melatonin signaling is important for the survival of retinal neurons. In the present study, we investigate the effects of aging on photoreceptor physiology and retinal organization in CH3-f+/+ mice, a melatonin proficient mouse strain. Our data indicate that the amplitude of the a and b waves of the scotopic and photopic electroretinogram decreases with age. Moreover, the daily rhythm in the amplitude of the a- and b- waves is lost during the aging process. Similarly, the scotopic threshold response is significantly affected by aging, but only when it is measured during the night. Interestingly, the changes observed in the ERGs are not paralleled by relevant changes in retinal morphological features, and administration of exogenous melatonin does not affect the ERGs in C3H-f+/+ at 12 months of age. This suggests that the responsiveness of the photoreceptors to exogenous melatonin is reduced during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2149307563,"Dopamine signaling modulates voluntary movement and reward-driven behaviors by acting through G protein-coupled receptors in striatal neurons, and defects in dopamine signaling underlie Parkinson's disease and drug addiction. Despite the importance of understanding how dopamine modifies the activity of striatal neurons to control basal ganglia output, the molecular mechanisms that control dopamine signaling remain largely unclear. Dopamine signaling also controls locomotion behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans. To better understand how dopamine acts in the brain we performed a large-scale dsRNA interference screen in C. elegans for genes required for endogenous dopamine signaling and identified six genes (eat-16, rsbp-1, unc-43, flp-1, grk-1, and cat-1) required for dopamine-mediated behavior. We then used a combination of mutant analysis and cell-specific transgenic rescue experiments to investigate the functional interaction between the proteins encoded by two of these genes, eat-16 and rsbp-1, within single cell types and to examine their role in the modulation of dopamine receptor signaling. We found that EAT-16 and RSBP-1 act together to modulate dopamine signaling and that while they are coexpressed with both D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors, they do not modulate D2 receptor signaling. Instead, EAT-16 and RSBP-1 act together to selectively inhibit D1 dopamine receptor signaling in cholinergic motor neurons to modulate locomotion behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1975395035,"A linkage map consisting of 24 linkage groups has been constructed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in Nicotiana tabacum. However, chromosomal assignments of all linkage groups have not yet been made. The Q chromosome in N. tabacum encodes a gene or genes triggering hybrid lethality, a phenomenon that causes death of hybrids derived from some crosses.We identified a linkage group corresponding to the Q chromosome using an interspecific cross between an N. tabacum monosomic line lacking the Q chromosome and N. africana. N. ingulba yielded inviable hybrids after crossing with N. tabacum. SSR markers on the identified linkage group were used to analyze hybrid lethality in this cross. The results implied that one or more genes on the Q chromosome are responsible for hybrid lethality in this cross. Furthermore, the gene(s) responsible for hybrid lethality in the cross N. tabacum × N. africana appear to be on the region of the Q chromosome to which SSR markers PT30342 and PT30365 map.Linkage group 11 corresponded to the Q chromosome. We propose a new method to correlate linkage groups with chromosomes in N. tabacum."
https://openalex.org/W2007355088,"Background To evaluate the efficacy of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) surgery and the optimal interval between penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and AGV implantation in a population of Asian patients with preexisting glaucoma who underwent PKP. Methodology/Principal Findings In total, 45 eyes of 45 patients were included in this retrospective chart review. The final intraocular pressures (IOPs), graft survival rate, and changes in visual acuity were assessed to evaluate the outcomes of AGV implantations in eyes in which AGV implantation occurred within 1 month of post-PKP IOP elevation (Group 1) and in eyes in which AGV implantation took place more than 1 month after the post-PKP IOP evaluation (Group 2). Factors that were associated with graft failure were analyzed, and the overall patterns of complications were reviewed. By their final follow-up visits, 58% of the patients had been successfully treated for glaucoma. After the operation, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to graft survival (p = 0.98), but significant differences for IOP control (p = 0.049) and the maintenance of visual acuity (VA) (p<0.05) were observed. One year after surgery, the success rates of IOP control in Group 1 and Group 2 were 80% and 46.7%, respectively, and these rates fell to 70% and 37.3%, respectively, by 2 years. Factors that were associated with a high risk of AGV failure were a diagnosis of preexisting angle-closure glaucoma, a history of previous PKP, and a preoperative IOP that was >21 mm Hg. The most common surgical complication, aside from graft failure, was hyphema. Conclusions/Significance Early AGV implantation results in a higher probability of AGV survival and a better VA outcome without increasing the risk of corneal graft failure as a result of post-PKP glaucoma drainage tube implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2011190723,"Dorsal stream areas provide motion information used by the oculomotor system to generate pursuit eye movements. Neurons in these areas saturate at low levels of luminance contrast. We therefore hypothesized that during the early phase of pursuit, eye velocity would exhibit an oculomotor gain function that saturates at low luminance contrast. To test this, we recorded eye movements in two macaques trained to saccade to an aperture in which a pattern of dots moved left or right. Shortly after the end of the saccade, the eyes followed the direction of motion with an oculomotor gain that increased with contrast before saturating. The addition of a second pattern of dots, moving in the opposite direction and superimposed on the first, resulted in a rightward shift of the contrast-dependent oculomotor gain function. The magnitude of this shift increased with the contrast of the second pattern of dots. Motion was nulled when the two patterns were equal in contrast. Next, we varied contrast over time. Contrast differences that disappeared before saccade onset biased post-saccadic eye movements at short latency. Changes in contrast occurring during or after saccade termination did not influence eye movements for approximately 150 ms. Earlier studies found that eye movements can be explained by a vector average computation when both targets are equal in contrast. We suggest that this averaging computation may reflect a special case of divisive normalization, yielding saturating contrast response functions that shift to the right with opposed motion, averaging motions when targets are equated in contrast."
