https://openalex.org/W1997993215,"Synthesis of soluble A, B, H, and Lewis b blood group antigens in humans is determined by the Secretor (Se) (FUT2) blood group locus. Genetic, biochemical, and molecular analyses indicate that this locus corresponds to an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene distinct from the genetically-linked H blood group α(1,2)fucosyltransferase locus. The accompanying paper (Rouquier, S., Lowe, J. B., Kelly, R. J., Fertitta, A. L., Lennon, G. G., and Giorgi, D.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4632-4639) describes the molecular cloning and mapping of two human DNA segments that are physically linked to, and cross-hybridize with, the H locus. We present here an analysis of these two new DNA segments. One of these, termed Sec1, is a pseudogene, because translational frameshifts and termination codons interrupt potential open reading frames that would otherwise share primary sequence similarity with the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. The other DNA segment, termed Sec2, predicts a 332-amino acid-long polypeptide, and a longer isoform, that share 68% sequence identity with the COOH-terminal 292 residues of the human H blood group α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. Sec2 encodes an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase with catalytic properties that mirror those ascribed to the Secretor locus-encoded α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. Approximately 20% of randomly-selected individuals were found to be apparently homozygous for an enzyme-inactivating nonsense allele (Trp143 → ter) at this locus, in correspondence to the frequency of the non-secretor phenotype in most human populations. Furthermore, each of six unrelated non-secretor individuals are also apparently homozygous for this null allele. These results indicate that Sec2 corresponds to the human Secretor blood group locus (FUT2) and indicate that homozygosity for a common nonsense allele is responsible for the non-secretor phenotype in many non-secretor individuals. Synthesis of soluble A, B, H, and Lewis b blood group antigens in humans is determined by the Secretor (Se) (FUT2) blood group locus. Genetic, biochemical, and molecular analyses indicate that this locus corresponds to an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene distinct from the genetically-linked H blood group α(1,2)fucosyltransferase locus. The accompanying paper (Rouquier, S., Lowe, J. B., Kelly, R. J., Fertitta, A. L., Lennon, G. G., and Giorgi, D.(1995) J. Biol.

The ABO blood group antigens consist of oligosaccharides synthesized by the sequential action of glycosyltransferases. While these molecules were classically defined as polymorphic red cell antigens, subsequent studies demonstrated that soluble forms of these molecules may be found in the saliva and in other secretions in some, although not all, humans (reviewed in (1Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 1-116PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sadler J.E. Ginsburg V. Robbins P.W. Biology of Carbohydrates. Vol. 2. Wiley, New York1984: 199-213Google Scholar, 3Oriol R. J. Immunogenet. 1990; 17: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability to elaborate soluble A, B, and H antigens is determined by the Secretor blood group locus. Homozygosity for null alleles at this locus occurs in approximately 20% of most populations (4Mourant A.E. Kop è c A.C. Domaniewska-Sobczak K. The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups and Other Biochemical Polymorphisms. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, London1976Google Scholar) and yields the non-secretory phenotype, characterized by absence of normal amounts of soluble A, B, and H substance in the saliva(1Watkins W.M. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1980; 10: 1-116PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, most humans maintain the secretor phenotype and elaborate soluble blood group substance in amounts easily detectable by standard hemagglutination-inhibition assays(5Gaensslen R.E. Bell S.C. Lee H.C. J. Forensic Sci. 1987; 32: 1016-1058PubMed Google Scholar, 6Milne R.W. Dawes C. Vox Sang. 1973; 25: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The penultimate step in the pathway leading to synthesis of soluble and membrane-associated A and B antigens is catalyzed by α(1,2)fucosyltransferases 1The abbreviations used are: α(1,2)-fucosyltransferaseGDP-L-fucose:β-D-galactoside 2-α-L-fucosyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s).

These enzymes form a precursor oligosaccharide substrate (Fuc α(1,2)Galβ-) termed the H antigen, which is an essential substrate for the final step in the pathway, catalyzed by allelic glycosyltransferases encoded by the ABO locus(1Watkins W.M.

By contrast, these studies are consistent with a hypothesis (7Oriol R. Danilovs J. Hawkins B.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1981; 33: 421-431PubMed Google Scholar) that the Secretor locus corresponds to a closely linked but distinct α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene whose expression is restricted to secretory epithelial cells in the salivary glands, gastrointestinal tract, and elsewhere, where it controls expression of soluble H antigen (and thus A or B antigen synthesis) in saliva and other secretions (reviewed in (3Oriol R.

In the accompanying paper(14Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.G. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we report the isolation of two human DNA segments that represent candidates for the Secretor α(1,2)fucosyltransferase locus because they cross-hybridize with the H blood group α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene and are in close physical proximity to this locus on chromosome 19. We report here the results of our structural and functional analysis of these two newly identified sequences. One of these, termed Sec1, represents a pseudogene. The other sequence, termed Sec2, encodes a polypeptide of 332 amino acids in length (and an isoform that is longer by 11 NH2-terminal amino acids) that in turn functions as an α(1,2)fucosyltransferase with catalytic properties corresponding to those assigned previously to the Secretor locus-encoded α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. We furthermore find that each of six unrelated non-secretor individuals maintains homozygosity for an allele at this locus which contains an enzyme-inactivating translational termination codon corresponding to amino acid residue 143. 10 of 52 (19%) randomly chosen individuals were determined to be homozygous for the mutant allele, in close correspondence to the frequency of the non-secretor phenotype in most populations. These results confirm that this newly described α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene is the FUT2 gene corresponding to the human Secretor blood group locus and provide molecular confirmation of the hypothesis (7Oriol R. Danilovs J. Hawkins B.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1981; 33: 421-431PubMed Google Scholar) that the H and Secretor loci correspond to two distinct α(1,2)fucosyltransferase genes. Cosmid 31553 (14Rouquier S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was mapped using a 1.3-kb probe made from the coding region of the human H blood group α(1,2) fucosyltransferase gene (8Larsen R.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (FUT1). Two sequences related to FUT1, termed Sec1 and Sec2 (Secretor candidates 1 and 2), were identified in this cosmid. The Sec1 sequence is contained within an 8.2-kb EcoRI fragment that cross-hybridizes with the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase coding region probe(14Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.G. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This 8.2-kb fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen) to create the vector pcDNAI-Sec1. Approximately 3.0 kb of this 8.2-kb fragment, representing the cross-hybridizing portion of this fragment, was subjected to DNA sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) using T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, Amersham). Both strands were sequenced using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the insert sequence. The Sec2 sequence is contained within an 18.5-kb EcoRI restriction fragment of the cosmid that cross-hybridizes with the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase coding region probe. Four cross-hybridizing and co-linear PstI fragments were subcloned into the PstI site of pTZ19R (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.), and their sequence was determined. Direct sequencing of the cosmid was also performed to verify restriction fragment junctions. Preliminary sequence analysis of the Sec2 allele within cosmid 31553 suggested that a nonsense codon at codon 143 might be an alternative to a tryptophan codon in a potential functional, wild type allele, by way of comparison to the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase DNA and protein sequence at this position. This analysis predicted that a putative wild type allele at this position would maintain an intact BstNI cleavage site (CCTGG), whereas this restriction site would not exist at this position in the putative Trp143 → ter null allele (CCTGA) within the cosmid sequence. Preliminary analysis of a secretor-positive individual indicated that he was heterozygous for the BstI restriction site at this position. We therefore cloned the coding regions of both alleles at the Sec2 locus from this individual, using the PCR (16Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1370-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (6794) Google Scholar) and primers that flank the codon corresponding to the Trp143 → ter polymorphism. Each primer contains 30 bp derived from the Sec2 DNA sequence (below, underlined) and 10 bp that contain a restriction site (EcoRI, GAATTC; XbaI, TCTAGA) to facilitate subcloning. One primer pair amplifies the DNA sequence between base pairs −216 and −187 (GCGCGAATTCTATAAACACACTTGAGATACATGCCTGTGC; Sec2 sequence underlined), 5′ to the “short” initiation codon, and between base pairs 535 and 564 (GCGCTCTAGAATGGACCCCTACAAAGGTGCCCGGCCGGCT; Sec2 sequence underlined) within the putative coding region of Sec2, and 3′ to the polymorphic DNA sequence corresponding to codon 143. The second primer pair amplifies the DNA sequence between base pairs 369 and 398 (GCGCGAATTCGAGGAATACCGCCACATCCCGGGGGAGTAC; Sec2 sequence underlined) of the coding sequence, at a position 5′ to the polymorphic site, and between base pairs 1049 and 1088 (GCGCTCTAGAGAACCATGTGCTTCTCATGCCCGGGCACTC; Sec2 sequence underlined), 50 base pairs 3′ to the termination codon. Genomic DNA isolated (17Ausubel J. Frederick M. Molecular Biology-Laboratory Manuals. Vols. 1 and 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) from this secretor-positive individual was subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (denaturation at 94°C for 1.5 min, annealing/extension for 2.5 min at 72°C). Fragments generated with these primers were restricted with EcoRI and XbaI, gel-purified, and cloned into EcoRI/XbaI-cleaved pTZ19R. Clones corresponding to the putative wild type allele, and the putative Trp143 → ter allele, were distinguished by restriction digestion with BstNI. The DNA sequences of a representative number of fragments from each allele were determined(15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Both strands were sequenced using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the insert sequence. Multiple clones corresponding to each allele were sequenced to distinguish PCR errors from actual sequence polymorphisms. For expression of Sec1, we used the vector pcDNAI-Sec1 (described above) and a related vector (pcDNAI-Sec1-rev) containing the identical 8.2-kb EcoRI fragment of Sec1 but cloned in the opposite orientation in pcDNAI. For the expression of the Sec2 allele in cosmid 31553(14Rouquier S. Lowe J.B. Kelly R.J. Fertitta A.L. Lennon G.G. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4632-4639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the PCR and cosmid 31553 template DNA were used to construct an expression vector (pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTse) with an insert encompassing the coding sequence of Sec2. The pair of PCR primers used amplifies the Sec2 sequence from a position bounded by base pair −15 and base pair 15 (assigning the A of the initiation codon, highlighted in bold type, as position 1; GCGCGAATTCCCTTTCTCCTTTCCCATGGCCCACTTCATC; Sec2 sequence underlined), to a position bounded by base pairs 1000 and 1029, immediately 3′ to the stop codon at base pairs 997-999 (GCGCTCTAGAGGAGAAAAGGTCTCAAAGGACGGGCCAGCA; Sec2 sequence underlined). PCR conditions were used that minimize PCR-mediated DNA sequence alterations(18Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product from this amplification was restricted with EcoRI and XbaI, gel-purified, and ligated into EcoRI-XbaI-doubly digested pcDNAI. Clones with a single insert in the correct orientation were subjected to DNA sequence analysis to identify one without PCR-mediated DNA sequence alterations; one such clone was termed pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTse. Other expression vectors containing single or multiple DNA sequence polymorphisms were assembled with restriction fragment exchange procedures (17Ausubel J. Frederick M. Molecular Biology-Laboratory Manuals. Vols. 1 and 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar) using restriction sites within pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTse. The vector pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-int, containing the wild type sequence corresponding to codon 143 (TGG; Trp) along with wild type protein sequence-neutral DNA sequence polymorphisms at DNA sequence positions 171 (wild type = A; cosmid-derived = G) and 216 (wild type = C; cosmid-derived = T), was constructed by replacing the 0.4-kb AgeI/PstI restriction fragment (base pairs 90 to 524) in pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTse, that encompasses these three polymorphisms, with the corresponding 0.4-kb AgeI/PstI restriction fragment from the wild type allele. This latter fragment was derived from a 599-bp fragment encompassing this 150-bp EcoRI-AgeI fragment, using the PCR, genomic DNA template from the heterozygous secretor-positive individual described above, a synthetic oligonucleotide PCR primer (GCGCGAATTCTATAAACACACTTGAGATACATGCCTGTGC; Sec2 sequence underlined) corresponding to a position approximately 100 bp upstream from the short initiation codon, and a primer corresponding to base pairs 535 and 564 of the Sec2 coding region (GCGCGAATTCATGGACCCCTACAAAGGTGCCCGGCCGGCT; Sec2 sequence underlined). A vector encompassing the short form of the entire wild type allele (pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-short) was constructed by exchanging the 0.5-kb PstI/XbaI restriction fragment (base pairs 524 to 1029) of pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-int (encodes Ser at codon 247) with the same fragment from the wild type allele (encodes Gly at codon 247) prepared from the heterozygous secretor-positive individual described above, using the PCR. To reiterate, this exchange replaces the serine codon found at protein sequence position 247 in the allele derived from cosmid 31553 with a glycine codon found at this position in the wild type allele. Finally, plasmid pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-long was constructed by replacing a 130-bp EcoRI-AgeI in pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-short (encompasses the short initiation codon) with a 150-bp EcoRI-AgeI fragment encompassing the “long” initiation codon. This latter fragment was generated using the PCR, wild type allele template DNA, and a primer pair that amplifies the DNA sequence between base pairs −35 and −6 of the Sec2 sequence (GCGCGAATTCCCATGCTGGTCGTTCAGATGCCTTTCTCCT; Sec2 sequence underlined), corresponding to the long initiation codon (indicated in bold in the PCR primer sequence), and between base pairs 535 and 564 of the Sec2 coding region (GCGCGAATTCATGGACCCCTACAAAGGTGCCCGGCCGGCT; Sec2 sequence underlined). Plasmid pcDNAI without an insert served as the negative control vector. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with expression vectors using a DEAE-dextran procedure, all as described previously(8Larsen R.D.

Cell extracts were prepared 72 h after transfection and were used in α(1,2)fucosyltransferase assays as described below. An aliquot of the cell culture medium was also subjected to assay for α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity. Cell extracts were also subjected to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity assays(17Ausubel J. Frederick M. Molecular Biology-Laboratory Manuals. Vols. 1 and 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol were prepared from transfected COS-7 cells using procedures previously described(9Kelly R.J. Ernst L.K. Larsen R.D. Bryant J.G. Robinson J.S. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cell extract protein concentrations were determined using the micro-BCA assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co.). Fucosyltransferase assays were performed in a volume of 20 μl and contained 3 μM GDP-[14C]fucose, various concentrations of unlabeled GDP-fucose, 5 mM ATP, 25 mM sodium phosphate at pH 6.0, 2-8 μl of cell extract (approximately 25-42 μg of protein), and various concentrations of different low molecular weight glycan acceptors, as described previously(9Kelly R.J. Ernst L.K. Larsen R.D. Bryant J.G. Robinson J.S. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary assays were used to adjust the amount of cell extract added to each assay to ensure that reactions were linear (no more than 10% of GDP-fucose consumed prior to assay termination). All assays were performed in duplicate, along with parallel control reactions containing no added acceptor. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 2 h and then terminated by adding 20 μl of ethanol and either 1 ml of water (for phenyl-β-D-galactoside acceptor assays) or 560 μl of water (for all other acceptor assays). The reactions were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected and used to determine the amount of fucosylated product formed. When phenyl-β-D-galactoside was used as the acceptor, a hydrophobic interaction chromatography procedure was used, in which the product of the reaction is retained by, and then eluted from, a Sep-Pak column (Waters-Millipore)(19Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ajmera S. Ernst L.K. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When neutral acceptors were used (lacto-N-biose and N-acetyllactosamine), a portion of the reaction was applied to a 500-μl column of Dowex 1X 2-400, formate form(18Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unincorporated GDP-fucose is retained on the column, and radiolabeled product is recovered in the column flow-through fractions and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For all acceptors tested, background counts obtained in the absence of added acceptor was no more than 1% of the total added radiolabel. When total enzyme activity was measured in a plate of transfected COS-7 cells, and in the media prepared from those cells, units were defined as picomoles of product (phenyl-β-D-galactoside acceptor) formed per h, per unit of 1-μl volume of cell extract or cell media assayed. For pH optimum determination, reactions were buffered with either 25 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5-6.0), 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5-7.5), or 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0-9.0), using concentrated solutions of these buffers previously titrated to the various pH values. The final pH of each reaction was directly determined with a micro pH electrode as described previously(19Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ajmera S. Ernst L.K. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenyl-β-D-galactoside was used as the acceptor in these assays. These experiments were completed using the enzyme derived from the pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-short vector. In assays to determine the apparent Km values, the concentration of the acceptors was varied as follows: phenyl-β-D-galactoside, 0-170 mM; lacto-N-biose I, 0-10 mM; N-acetyllactosamine, 0-12.5 mM. These assays were performed in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, using 3 μM GDP-[14C]fucose. To determine the apparent Km value for GDP-fucose, 3 μM GDP-[14C]fucose was supplemented with different amounts of unlabeled GDP-fucose (19Rajan V.P. Larsen R.D. Ajmera S. Ernst L.K. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11158-11167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to achieve final GDP-fucose concentrations that ranged from 3 μM to 400 μM. The GDP-fucose Km determination was completed in reactions containing 25 mM phenyl-β-D-galactoside and buffered with 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Apparent Michaelis constants were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots of substrate concentration-rate determinations. These experiments were completed using the enzyme derived from the pcDNAI-α(1,2)FTSe-short vector. Human genomic DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples(11Kumazaki T. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), or from freshly plucked hairs(20Higuchi R. von Beroldingen C.H. Sensabaugh G.F. Erlich H.A. Nature. 1988; 332: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), from 60 individuals. The secretor status of eight of these individuals was determined with standard blood group typing methods, using their red blood cells and saliva(21Walker R.H. American Association of Blood Banks Technical Manual. American Association of Blood Banks, Arlington, VA1990Google Scholar). PCR analyses were performed using conditions described above.

The cross-hybridizing portions of each of these sequences were subcloned, sequenced, and tested for function, in order to determine if either represent the Secretor blood group fucosyltransferase locus. Sequence analysis of the cross-hybridizing portion of Sec1 identified substantial primary sequence similarity to the human H blood group α(1,2)fucosyltransferase gene (Fig. 1). This sequence yields an open reading frame with primary protein sequence similarity to the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase, beginning at a methionine codon at a position that roughly corresponds to the initiator codon of the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. This open reading frame predicts an amino-terminal hydrophobic segment typical of the membrane-spanning signal-anchor sequences found in mammalian glycosyltransferases(24Lowe J.B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 289-307PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the DNA sequence of the Sec1 fragment does not yield a single long translational reading frame corresponding to the H locus, due to the presence of frameshift and nonsense mutations that disrupt this reading frame, and each of the other two, relative to the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase reading frame. Maximal and sustained alignment of amino acid sequence residues predicted by the Sec1 DNA sequence with the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase sequence may be accomplished, however, by conceptual suppression of a single frameshift mutation and a single nonsense mutation, as shown in Fig. 1. This conceptual sequence maintains several predicted asparagine-linked glycosylation sites(25Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar), including some that are at positions precisely corresponding to those in the H α(1,2)fucosyltransferase. Expression of this segment in α((1,2)fucosyltransferase-deficient COS-7 cells (via vectors pcDNAI-Sec1 or pcDNAI-Sec1-rev; see “Materials and Methods”) generates no detectable α(1,2)fucosyltransferase activity (data not shown). Furthermore, transcripts corresponding to this gene are not detectable by Northern blot or cDNA selection approaches (dat"

https://openalex.org/W2074295150,"The biological action of adrenomedullin, a novel hypotensive peptide, on bovine aortic endothelial cells, was examined. The specific binding of adrenomedullin to these cells was observed, and adrenomedullin was found to induce intracellular cAMP accumulation in a dose-dependent manner.

Adrenomedullin also induced increase of intracellular free Ca2+ in endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner.

This intracellular free Ca2+ increase resulted from phospholipase C activation and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, and seemed to cause nitric oxide synthase activation by monitoring intracellular cGMP accumulation. Both cAMP accumulation and Ca2+ increased responses to adrenomedullin were mediated by cholera toxin-sensitive G protein, but the two signal transduction pathways were independent.

INTRODUCTIONAdrenomedullin is a novel hypotensive peptide isolated from human pheochromocytoma(1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichili Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). It consists of 52 amino acid residues with one intracellular disulfide bond and is classified into the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CGRPcalcitonin gene-related peptideRASMCrat aortic smooth muscle cellsBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsH-89N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamidePTXpertussis toxinCTXcholera toxinIns-1,4,5-P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. family. It has a highly conserved structure among mammals such as porcine (2Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Ichiki Y. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and rat (3Sakata J. Shimokubo T. Kitamura K. Nakamura S. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Only a few pharmacological activities of adrenomedullin have been revealed, such as a potent hypotensive effect in anesthetized rat and cAMP accumulation in rat platelets and aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC)(1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichili Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 4Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Kano H. Sato K. Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the strong hypotensive effect and other physiological roles are still unclear. Adrenomedullin may act primarily on vascular endothelial cells because it exists in plasma at comparable levels (5Ichiki Y. Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) with atrial natriuretic peptide, another circulating hypotensive hormone secreted by the heart. To investigate the physiological role(s) and mechanism of pharmacological effects, we examined the response of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to adrenomedullin. Here we report the action of adrenomedullin on BAEC through two independent signal transduction pathways, cAMP accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman adrenomedullin, bradykinin, and CGRP were obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Bovine serum albumin, EGTA, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, HEPES, and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester were from Sigma. N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-89) was from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). U-73122, U-73343, pertussis toxin (PTX) and cholera toxin (CTX) were from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Fura-2/AM was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). 125I-Adrenomedullin was synthesized by the lactoperoxidase method and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (specific activity: 80 TBq/mmol) as in (6Ishizaka Y. Ishizaka Y. Tanaka M. Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar).Cell CulturePrimary culture of BAEC was prepared as reported previously (7Liano J.K. Homcy C.K. Circ. Res. 1993; 70: 1018-1026Google Scholar) and maintained in 199 medium (Flow Laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) supplemented with fetal calf serum (20%), HEPES (20 mM, pH 7.3), heparin (12,000 units/liter, NOVO, Denmark), and bovine endothelial mitogen (100 mg/liter, Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). The cells at the third or fourth passage were used for all experiments. RASMC were prepared as in (8Kambayashi Y. Nakajima S. Ueda M. Inouye K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. The cells at the seventh passage were used. All cultures were kept at 37°C under 5% CO2 atmosphere.Competitive Binding AssayAccording to the procedure in the previous report(9Itazaki K. Shigeri Y. Fujimoto M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 245: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), confluent cells were incubated in Hanks' solution, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 250 μg/ml bacitracin, and 0.1 mM amastatin) and 20 pM125I-adrenomedullin in the presence or absence of cold peptides for competition for 2 h at 20°C. After washing twice with ice-cold Hanks' solution containing inhibitors, cells were lysed in 10% SDS, 1 N NaOH and counted for radioactivity in a γ counter.Measurements of cAMP and cGMPCellular cAMP and cGMP were measured as reported previously(10Shimekake Y. Kawabata T. Nakamura M. Nagata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). After washing twice with Hanks', 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, pH 7.4, cells were incubated for 15 min in the same solution in the presence or absence of adrenomedullin. Cells were lysed in 6% trichloroacetic acid, and the acid was removed by water-saturated diethyl ether extraction. After lyophilization of the aqueous phase, cyclic nucleotides were determined by radioimmunoassay (Yamasa, Tokyo, Japan).Determination of Cytoplasmic Free Ca2+ Concentration ([Ca2+]i)Cells were harvested with 0.1% trypsin and 0.01% EDTA and then washed once with growth medium. Next, the cells were counted, resuspended in Hanks', 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated with 2 μM Fura-2/AM for 30 min at 37°C. The Fura-2-loaded cells were washed with HEPES-buffered Hanks' and resuspended in the same solution at 1 × 105 cells/ml in a cuvette with continuous stirring. Fluorescence was measured with a CAF-100 spectrofluorometer (Japan Spectroscopy Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The level of Ca2+ mobilization was determined from the excitation ratio of 340 nm and 380 nm (F340/F380). The ratio of 0.1 corresponded to about 34 nM in Δ[Ca2+]i.Measurement of Inositol 1,4,5-TrisphosphateCells were washed twice with Hanks', 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM LiCl, pH 7.3, and incubated in the same solution for 10 min. Next, the cells were exposed to 0.1 μM adrenomedullin in the same solution at 37°C for an appropriate time. The cells were then lysed in 15% trichloroacetic acid and processed as described above for the cAMP assay up to lyophilization. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) was determined by the protein binding assay (Amersham Corp.) as described in (11Fukami K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14985-14989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSBinding AssaySpecific binding of adrenomedullin to BAEC was observed as shown in Fig. 1. Because cold adrenomedullin at 5 μM did not show complete displacement of binding [125I]-adrenomedullin, the exact IC50 value could not be calculated, but it seemed to be around 10 nM. Some reported that CGRP and CGRP (8-37), a CGRP antagonist, inhibit adrenomedullin-induced actions in certain systems (4Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Kano H. Sato K. Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Nuki C. Kawasaki H. Kitamura K. Takenaga M. Kangawa K. Eto T. Wada A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In BAEC, CGRP at 1 μM did not compete with 125I-adrenomedullin binding at all, suggesting that adrenomedullin does not share the same binding site (or receptor) with CGRP in BAEC.Effect of Adrenomedullin on Intracellular cAMP AccumulationA recent report showed that adrenomedullin causes accumulation of intracellular cAMP in smooth muscle cells(4Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Kano H. Sato K. Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Next, we examined alteration of the intracellular cAMP level in BAEC responding to adrenomedullin. Adrenomedullin increased the cAMP level in a dose-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 2A. An effective response was observed at concentrations higher than 10 pM, and EC50 was 0.175 ± 0.017 nM (n = 4). This EC50 value was about 100 times lower than the apparent IC50 in the binding assay, suggesting that the high affinity binding sites for cAMP response were hidden among the large number of binding sites with lower affinity. The maximal effect was observed at 1 nM and higher. Similar increase of cellular cAMP level was observed in RASMC, as shown in the previous report(4Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Kano H. Sato K. Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), but EC50 (1.41 ± 0.49 nM, n = 4) was about 10 times higher than that obtained in BAEC. The increase of cAMP is usually mediated by CTX-sensitive Gαs protein. The cAMP increase by adrenomedullin was also diminished when cells were pretreated with CTX (100 ng/ml, 20 h) as observed in dopamine-D1 receptor (13Liu Y.F. Civelli O. Zhou Q.-Y. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1815-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor(14Yu Y. Nair B.G. Patel T.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), while pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml, 20 h) had no effect on cAMP response to adrenomedullin (Fig. 2B). The addition of H-89 (10 μM), a selective cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor(15Geilen C.C. Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Reutter W. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), at 30 min before CTX treatment (2 μg/ml, 4 h) did not alter the deterioration of cAMP response to adrenomedullin by CTX under the condition that blocked the cAMP-dependent hormone release from rat GH3 cells (16Shimekake Y. Ohta S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is unlikely that CTX desensitizes the adrenomedullin receptor through the constitutive cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation.Figure 2:Response of intracellular cAMP level to adrenomedullin.

Adrenomedullin increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). The maximal response was observed at 0.1 μM and higher. The EC50 was 3.07 ± 0.21 nM (n = 7), which was comparable with that of bradykinin (6.7 nM(17Hirano K. Hirano M. Kanaide H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 244: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the maximal [Ca2+]i level was one-third to one-half of that induced by bradykinin at 1 μM. This [Ca2+]i increase was receptor-mediated because the successive addition of adrenomedullin failed to elicit a significant [Ca2+]i increase, probably due to receptor desensitization (data not shown). The [Ca2+]i increase profile by adrenomedullin was similar to that of bradykinin, which was thought to be mediated by both Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor (release from intracellular Ca2+ storage) and Ca2+ channel in the plasma membrane (influx of extracellular Ca2+).Figure 3:Dose response of [Ca2+]i increase to adrenomedullin.

(n = 7) with values relative to the response to 1 μM adrenomedullin in each experiment as 100%. [Ca2+]i increase was measured with Fura-2-loaded cells suspended in Hanks' solution by monitoring fluorescence ratio of 340-380 nm (F340/F380).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For further investigation of the Ca2+ mobilization mechanism of adrenomedullin in BAEC, we examined the effects of channel blockers and other inhibitory reagents. First, EGTA, SK& (a receptor operating ion channel blocker), and nifedipine (an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker) did not affect the initial peak for [Ca2+]i increase by adrenomedullin, but EGTA and SK& caused loss of the prolonged plateau phase (Fig. 4A), suggesting that this prolonged plateau phase was due to Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane ion channel (with the exception of the L-type channel). Next, thapsigargin (3 μM), which is a microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor and known to inhibit the bradykinin-induced Ca2+ mobilization(18Machrthur H. Hecker M. Busse R. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), significantly diminished the initial peak of [Ca2+]i increase by adrenomedullin, while the second prolonged phase was retained (Fig. 4B). This retained prolonged phase was lost when cells were successively treated with SK&, suggesting again that this prolonged response was mediated by an ion channel. Ziegelstein et al.(19Ziegelstein R.C. Spurgeon H.A. Pili R. Passaniti A. Cheng L. Corda S. Lakatta E.G. Capogrossi M.C. Cir. Res. 1994; 74: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have recently reported the existence of a ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ storage site in vascular endothelial cells. Ryanodine at 5 μM did not affect the [Ca2+]i increase response to adrenomedullin as shown in Fig. 4B. When the cells were pretreated with 10 μM U-73122, an inhibitor of agonist-induced phospholipase C activation(20Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), adrenomedullin did not induce either the initial or the prolonged [Ca2+]i increase, while pretreatment with 10 μM U-73343, an inactive analog to U-73122(20Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), did not affect the [Ca2+]i increase response at all (Fig. 4C). Pretreatment of cells with 10 μM H-89 did not affect the [Ca2+]i increase response. These results suggest that activation of phospholipase C is required for an adrenomedullin-induced biphasic [Ca2+]i increase and that the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is not involved in the [Ca2+]i increase as is often the case in hormone-secreting cells(21Lussian B.T. Frebch M.B. Moor B.C. Kraicer J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Lussian B.T. Frebch M.B. Moor B.C. Kraicer J.

This also suggests that the receptor responsible for the [Ca2+]i increase response to adrenomedullin is not the CGRP receptor, as the adrenomedullin response would have been desensitized by CGRP pretreatment. For further characterization of the G protein involved in the [Ca2+]i increase response to adrenomedullin, the effects of PTX and CTX were again examined (Fig. 4D). The adrenomedullin-induced [Ca2+]i increase was not affected at all by the PTX treatment (100 ng/ml, 20 h) but was greatly diminished by the CTX treatment (2 μg/ml, 4 h). The addition of H-89 (10 μM) at 30 min before CTX treatment did not alter the deterioration of [Ca2+]i response, suggesting again that the desensitization of the adrenomedullin receptor through cAMP-dependent protein kinase constitutively activated by CTX is unlikely. Thus, the G protein in BAEC responsible for the [Ca2+]i response to adrenomedullin showed similar toxin sensitivity to that observed in the cAMP response (Fig. 2B).Figure 4:Effects of reagents possibly influencing on [Ca2+]i increase response to adrenomedullin.

The traces were obtained from one experiment but are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Adrenomedullin on Ins-1,4,5-P3 LevelIntracellular Ca2+ mobilization is often mediated by Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation, as observed with some hormones, bradykinin(23Myers D.E.

Adrenomedullin at 0.1 μM also increased the intracellular Ins-1,4,5-P3 level within 10 s (Fig. 5). The maximal level was about one-third of that by bradykinin, corresponding to the difference in maximal [Ca2+]i levels induced by bradykinin and adrenomedullin (Fig. 3A). These observations suggest that adrenomedullin activates phospholipase C followed by Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation and then increases [Ca2+]i via Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor (a thapsigargin-sensitive and ryanodine-insensitive subtype) of endoplasmic reticulum in BAEC.Figure 5:Time course of Ins-1,4,5-P3 response of BAEC to adrenomedullin.

Thomb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, adrenomedullin may also induce a hypotensive effect through an NO-mediated pathway because it induces [Ca2+]i increase as shown above. This led us to examine the intracellular cGMP level in BAEC. Adrenomedullin at 0.1 μM significantly elevated the cGMP level (Fig. 6). The potency was about one-third of that by bradykinin and was parallel to that for Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation and the [Ca2+]i response. Pretreatment of cells with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an NO synthase inhibitor, deteriorated the cGMP accumulation by adrenomedullin, suggesting that the cGMP generation was mediated by NO.Figure 6:Intracellular cGMP increase response of BAEC to adrenomedullin. After preincubation with or without 100 nMNG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, cells were treated with Hanks' solution in the absence (openbar) or presence (hatchedbar) of 100 nM adrenomedullin for 15 min, and then cGMP levels were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as means ± S.E.

Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichili Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), although its hypotensive mechanism has not been clarified. Recently, adrenomedullin was found to be 10-fold more potent than CGRP for increasing the cAMP level in RASMC, suggesting that adrenomedullin and CGRP may share the same receptor (4Eguchi S. Hirata Y. Kano H. Sato K. Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the actions of adrenomedullin on BAEC, because vascular endothelial cells may be the primary target of the circulating hormones (adrenomedullin is present in normal plasma at about 17 pg/ml(3Sakata J. Shimokubo T. Kitamura K. Nakamura S. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and BAEC showed the most specific binding of 125I-adrenomedullin among the several cultured cells examined (data not shown). Results from the competitive binding assay and [Ca2+]i response indicated the existence of an adrenomedullin-specific receptor in BAEC. We also found that adrenomedullin could activate at least two signal transduction pathways, cAMP accumulation and [Ca2+]i mobilization, in BAEC. The cAMP accumulation by adrenomedullin seemed to be mediated by CTX-sensitive PTX-insensitive G protein, probably Gαs, which is involved in many systems of receptor-operated cAMP increase. As the cAMP response to adrenomedullin was not completely diminished by CTX treatment (Fig. 2, B and C), it could be possible that the cAMP increase response to adrenomedullin is mediated in part by other mechanism(s), such as facilitating the interaction between activated Gαs and adenyl cyclase as shown in the case of angiotensin II action in RASMC (28Kubalak S.W. Webb J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H86-H96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second signal by adrenomedullin, [Ca2+]i mobilization, was also mediated by CTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive subtype of G protein. In relation to this, Gil-Longo et al.(29Gil-Longo J. Dofour M.N. Guillon G. Lugnier C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 247: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have reported that the [Ca2+]i and cGMP increase in BAEC by bradykinin was mediated by CTX-sensitive G protein and proposed Gαq and Gα11 as candidates for the G protein. Using some inhibitors and blockers, we showed that the [Ca2+]i increase response of BAEC to adrenomedullin was biphasic. Adrenomedullin activated phospholipase C through its specific receptor and coupled CTX-sensitive G protein and accelerated Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation to stimulate Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ storage, endoplasmic reticulum, through thapsigargin-sensitive Ins-1,4,5-P3 receptor on the one hand (the initial rapid increase phase), and through the ion channel on the plasma membrane to promote Ca2+ influx on the other hand (the prolonged increase phase).We also showed the possibility that the [Ca2+]i increase response of BAEC to adrenomedullin caused activation of NO synthase and NO release monitored by cGMP formation. It has been reported that bradykinin evokes a PTX-insensitive phosphoinositol response to increase [Ca2+]i and cGMP in endothelial cells(29Gil-Longo J. Dofour M.N. Guillon G. Lugnier C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 247: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Endothelin 3 also elicited a [Ca2+]i increase response through the receptor coupled with PTX-sensitive G protein in endothelial cells causing NO release(30Emori T. Hirata Y. Kanno K. Ohta K. Eguchi S. Imai T. Shichiri M. Marumo F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All of these peptide hormones were thought to stimulate Ins-1,4,5-P3 formation through phospholipase C activation. The toxin sensitivity was similar in [Ca2+]i response to adrenomedullin and to bradykinin but not to endothelin 3, suggesting that at least two subtypes of G protein could be involved in the [Ca2+]i increase response. Adrenomedullin was likely to open ion channel(s), because EGTA and SK& diminished the prolonged phase in the [Ca2+]i response, while the response was completely diminished by the addition of SK& after treatment with thapsigargin. The activation of phospholipase C was also involved in the ion channel opening, because U-73122 completely extinguished the adrenomedullin-induced biphasic [Ca2+]i response. In this respect, Ins-1,4,5-P3 and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate are possible candidates for direct action on the ion channel(31Fasolato C. Innocenti B. Pozzan T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 77-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 32Adams D.J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1994; 4: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The two signal transduction pathways activated by adrenomedullin seemed to be independent, because a strong inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, H-89, had no effect on [Ca2+]i response to adrenomedullin at a concentration that caused great loss of cAMP-dependent hormone release from GH3 cells(16Shimekake Y. Ohta S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, cAMP-elevating agents, such as forskolin, dibutylyl-cAMP, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, did not increase [Ca2+]i in endothelial cells (data not shown). It is not clear whether these two adrenomedullin-induced independent signal transduction pathways are mediated by one receptor or not. The big difference between the apparent IC50 value in binding assay (Fig. 1) and EC50 value in cAMP increase response (Fig. 2A) suggests the existence of different receptor subtypes. However, there are several reports of one receptor being coupled to two independent signal mechanisms, for example, the prostacyclin receptor (33Namba T. Oida H. Sugimoto Y. Kakizuka A. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9986-9992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the endothelin receptor(34Oda K. Fujitani Y. Watakabe T. Inui T. Okada T. Urade Y. Okuda-Ashitaka E. Ito S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 299: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that the hypotensive effect of adrenomedullin could be explained by at least two mechanisms. First, adrenomedullin can directly act on vascular smooth muscle cells to cause intracellular cAMP increase leading to relaxation, probably through inactivation of myosin light chain kinase. Second, adrenomedullin can act on vascular endothelial cells to cause a [Ca2+]i increase leading to the activation of NO synthase and NO release. The released NO could then induce the relaxation of smooth muscle cells. In smooth muscle cells, [Ca2+]i increase should lead to contraction, but we could not detect any [Ca2+]i increase in RASMC by adrenomedullin even at 1 μM (data not shown), while intracellular cAMP increased greatly (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the signal transduction mechanism by adrenomedullin in smooth muscle cells must differ from that in endothelial cells. Recently, immunoreative adrenomedullin was detected in the conditioned medium of cultured endothelial cells(35Sugo S. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Miyamoto K. Kitamura K. Sakata J. Eto T. Matuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), suggesting the secretion of adrenomedullin from endothelial cells. Therefore, adrenomedullin may act as a local modulator as well as a circulating hormone in the cardiovascular system. The physiological role of intracellular cAMP accumulation in endothelial cells is not clear. This activity is seen to be important because the activity was 15-fold more potent than [Ca2+]i increasing activity. Further investigation, for example, by altering the expression of some genes, should be done to solve this problem. INTRODUCTIONAdrenomedullin is a novel hypotensive peptide isolated from human pheochromocytoma(1Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Ichili Y. Nakamura S. Matsuo H. Eto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). It consists of 52 amino acid residues with one intracellular disulfide bond and is classified into the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CGRPcalcitonin gene-related peptideRASMCrat aortic smooth muscle cellsBAECbovine aortic endothelial cellsH-89N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamidePTXpertussis toxinCTXcholera toxinIns-1,4,5-P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. family. It has a highly conserved structure among mammals such as porcine (2Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Ichiki Y. Matsuo H. Eto T.

Only a few pharmacological activities of adrenomedullin have been revealed, such as a potent hypotensive effect in anesthetized rat and cAMP accumulation in rat platelets and aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC)(1Kitamura K.

Watanabe Y. Watanabe T.X. Nakajima K. Sakakibara S. Marumo F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the strong hypotensive effect and other physiological roles are still unclear. Adrenomedullin may act primarily on vascular endothelial cells because it exists in plasma at comparable levels (5Ichiki Y. Kitamura K. Kangawa K. Kawamoto M. Matsuo H. Eto T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) with atrial natriuretic peptide, another circulating hypotensive hormone secreted by the heart. To investigate the physiological role(s) and mechanism of pharmacological effects, we examined the response of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to adrenomedullin. Here we report the action of adrenomedullin on BAEC through two independent signal transduction pathways, cAMP accumulation and Ca2+ mobilization."

Mouse EGF (mEGF), human EGF (hEGF), and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) bind to the human EGF receptor (EGFR) with similar affinities at pH 7.4. However, the binding properties of these ligands have substantially different pH sensitivities resulting in varying degrees of dissociation from the receptors at lower pH levels characteristic of endosomes. We employed a steady-state sorting assay to determine the fraction of ligand sorted to recycling versus degradation as a function of the number of intracellular ligand molecules in mouse B82 fibroblasts. mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα display significantly different steady-state endosomal sorting patterns which correspond to the extent of their dissociation at endosomal pH. Moreover, several recombinant hEGF mutants with differing affinities exhibit altered endosomal sorting compared to hEGF, demonstrating a similar direct relationship between ligand binding properties and endosomal sorting outcomes. Intracellular trafficking of the EGF ligands was also monitored by measuring the observed degradation rate constants.

Eukaryotic cells are able to direct and maintain substantial flows of intracellular protein and membrane traffic. Newly synthesized proteins are directed through the secretory pathway or targeted to various organelles. Molecules are taken up from the cell's environment through the endocytotic pathway and sorted to different cellular locations. Similarities in sorting have emerged between the secretory and endocytotic pathways. For example, most membrane-associated proteins appear to flow through default pathways unless they are specifically retained or targeted to particular destinations (Hopkins, 1992). Small GTP binding proteins are localized to distinct compartments within both pathways and are involved in regulation of membrane traffic (Novick and Brennwald, 1993). Although more is becoming understood about intracellular trafficking through both the secretory and endocytotic pathways, the mechanisms underlying the sorting decisions are not well characterized. Internalized ligand/receptor complexes in the endocytotic pathway may be sorted to a variety of destinations. For example, transferrin releases its iron in the acidic environment of the endosome and almost completely recycles back to the cell surface with its receptor (Hopkins and Trowbridge, 1983). In contrast, low density lipoprotein dissociates from its receptor and is degraded in lysosomes while its receptor recycles back to the cell surface (Goldstein et al., 1985). Signaling molecules, such as growth factors, are often degraded along with their receptors down-regulating cellular response to future hormonal stimulation (Carpenter and Cohen, 1976; Stoscheck and Carpenter, 1984). In the absence of specific targeting, the default pathway for internalized membrane and membrane-associated proteins is recycling back to the cell surface (Hopkins, 1992; Mayor et al., 1993). Fluorescent lipid analogues internalized in fibroblasts were efficiently recycled back to the plasma membrane (Koval and Pagano, 1990). The majority of endocytosed plasma membrane proteins have also been shown to recycle with only a minor fraction being degraded (Burgert and Thilo, 1983; Raub et al., 1986). Differential endosomal sorting of recycling receptors from dissociated, fluid-phase ligands has been quantitatively studied. Dunn et al.(1989) demonstrated that repeated removal of recycling receptors increases sorting efficiency. The iterative removal of recycling components from the endosomal tubules which possess much higher area-to-volume ratios than the endosomal central vesicle was proposed as a mechanism for the segregation of membrane-associated, recycling components from fluid-phase, lysosomally directed molecules (Dunn et al., 1989; Mayor et al., 1993). Membrane-associated components are also specifically targeted for degradation, and this is a much less understood phenomenon. Signaling ligand/receptor complexes, such as EGF/receptor complexes, 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptormmousehhumanTGFtransforming growth factorPAOphenylarsine oxide. platelet-derived growth factor/receptor complexes, and colony-stimulating factor/receptor complexes, are often targeted for degradation in lysosomes (Stoscheck and Carpenter, 1984; Guilbert and Stanley, 1986; Sorkin et al., 1991). Other membrane-associated proteins, such as lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, are internalized from the plasma membrane and targeted to lysosomes (Guarnieri et al., 1993). Aggregated receptors (e.g. immune complexes) are also routed to lysosomes (Ukkonen et al., 1986; Mellman and Plutner, 1984). epidermal growth factor EGF receptor mouse human transforming growth factor phenylarsine oxide. Linderman and Lauffenburger(1988) proposed that endosomal sorting of membrane-associated receptors is governed by molecular transport out of the central endosomal vesicle into recycling tubules. They postulated that endosomal retention resulting in lysosomal targeting of membrane-associated receptors is modulated by interactions with putative sorting components and that these interactions may be influenced by the receptor's state of occupancy and aggregation. We have employed EGF and its receptor as a model system with which to investigate the endosomal sorting of membrane-associated receptors. Herbst et al.(1994) demonstrated that the intracellular trafficking of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is regulated by an endosomal apparatus which preferentially recognizes cytoplasmic domain elements of occupied EGFRs compared to unoccupied EGFRs. We have further characterized the endosomal sorting of EGF/receptor complexes using a series of EGFR mutants and demonstrated that lysosomal targeting of occupied EGFRs occurs via endosomal retention that is both specific and saturable (French et al., 1994). These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of endosomal sorting proposed by Linderman and Lauffenburger(1988). Using members of the EGF family as well as several site-directed recombinant hEGF mutants, we have now investigated how receptor-ligand interactions modulate endosomal sorting. The pH sensitivities of different EGF ligands' binding parameters were measured and correlated with endosomal sorting outcomes. We present evidence that changes in ligand binding at the low endosomal pH levels directly alter the intracellular trafficking of the ligand. mEGF, purified from mouse submaxillary glands, was a generous gift from H. S. Wiley (University of Utah). Recombinant hEGF proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and purified with reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (Tadaki and Niyogi, 1993). TGFα was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Ligands were iodinated with 125I (Amersham) using IODOBEADS following the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce Biochemicals). Free iodine was removed from labeled ligands with an 8-ml column of Sephadex G-15 (Pharmacia). Specific activity of the labeled ligands ranged from 45,000 to 250,000 cpm/ng. B82 mouse fibroblast cells, which lack endogenous EGF receptors, that had been transfected with the wild-type (WT) human EGF receptor were a generous gift of G. N. Gill (University of California at San Diego). Cell surface receptor expression was determined to be 2.4 × 105 receptors per cell by Scatchard analysis at 0°C (Chen et al., 1989). Transfected cells were maintained with 5 μM methotrexate and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Flow Laboratories) containing dialyzed 10% calf serum (Sigma). Phenylarsine oxide (PAO) was purchased from Sigma. B82 cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm tissue culture dishes and were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with no bicarbonate containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (D/H/B) 4 to 12 h before experiments. Internalization must be inhibited during association experiments so that the measured association and dissociation with the cell surface are not compromised. Internalization can be inhibited by using temperature or pharmacological manipulations. Experiments performed at 4°C effectively eliminate internalization (Dunn et al., 1980), but this lower temperature affects the values of association and dissociation rate constants (Lauffenburger and Linderman, 1993). PAO has been shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of internalization (Low et al., 1981; Gibson et al., 1989). Relative levels of inhibition achieved using low temperature or PAO were investigated in an experiment with three parallel sets of six plates. Two sets experienced no pretreatment while one set was incubated with 0.1 mM PAO at 4°C for 20 min. All three sets were then incubated with 1.7 nM125I-hEGF for 2 h at either 4°C or 37°C. Inhibition of internalization was measured by examining the amount of labeled ligand associated with the cell surface compared to the amount internalized. In the absence of any intervention at 37°C, the ratio of surface-associated to internalized ligand was 0.8 ± 0.3. The plates which were pretreated with 0.1 mM PAO and incubated at 37°C had a ratio of 15 ± 2, and the plates without pretreatment incubated at 4°C had a ratio of 44 ± 6. Therefore, PAO pretreatment will significantly inhibit internalization while still allowing measurements of binding parameters to be made at physiologically relevant temperatures. Further controls were performed to determine both the minimal concentration of PAO and incubation time necessary to effectively inhibit internalization in B82 fibroblasts. Cells used in association experiments were pretreated for 20 min with 0.1 mM PAO. A concentrated 0.1 M PAO stock solution was made in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to the final concentration in WHIPS buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone). Following the PAO pretreatment, parallel plates of cells were incubated at 37°C in 1 ml of 1.7 nM labeled ligand for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 min after which they were transferred to 4°C and rapidly washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold WHIPS buffer. The cells were washed for 12 min with an acid strip (50 mM glycine-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0) containing 2 M urea to remove surface-bound radioactivity (~98% stripping efficiency (Wiley et al., 1991)) and were then solubilized with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to check that the amount of internalized radioactivity was minimal. A plot of the number of surface-associated ligands per cell versus time was fit with an analytic solution to the following differential equation which describes the interaction between surface receptors and ligands in the absence of internalization and with no ligand depletion (Lauffenburger and Linderman, 1993): dC/dt = kf(R - C)Lo - krC where C, R, Lo, kf, and kr represent the number of surface complexes, the total number of receptors, the ligand concentration, and the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively. To simulate environments at the cell surface or in early endosomes, these experiments were performed either in 20 mM HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at pH 7.4 or in 0.1 M citric acid/phosphate buffer with 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone and 135 mM NaCl at pH 6. The steady-state endosomal sorting assay described by French et al., 1994 was used to directly monitor endosomal sorting outcomes. Parallel plates of cells were incubated at 37°C in 2 to 5 mls of D/H/B buffer containing various concentrations (0.008-17 nM) of 125I-ligand for 2 h to allow the sorting process to reach a steady-state (Wiley et al., 1991, Herbst et al., 1994). After the 2-h incubation, the cells were washed with acid-strip at 4°C to remove most of the surface-bound ligand (~90% stripping efficiency (Wiley et al., 1991)), rinsed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and returned to 37°C. The cells were then bathed in 1 ml of D/H/B buffer containing 167 nM unlabeled mEGF to inhibit the rebinding and reinternalization of recycled labeled ligand. The medium was collected from parallel plates at 0, 0, 5, 5, 10, and 15 min. Cells were rinsed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold WHIPS buffer, washed with acid-strip containing 2 M urea to remove the surface-bound radioactivity, and then solubilized with 2% SDS to collect the internalized radioactivity. A mass balance for each time point was calculated by adding the amount of radioactivity internalized, released into the medium, and associated with the surface. Cell number per plate was determined with parallel plates using a hemocytometer. Nonspecific binding was determined to be less than 2% of total binding in B82 cells (Wiley et al., 1991). Nonspecific internalization of fluid-phase ligand was investigated by comparing the amounts of labeled ligand which nontransfected B82 cells and B82 cells transfected with the EGFRs internalized after 2 h and was generally found to be negligible (less than 2%) except at high concentrations (e.g. for mEGF at 17 nM, nonspecific internalization accounted for 8% of the internalized ligand) and for the low affinity ligands (e.g. for our lowest affinity ligand, Y13G, nonspecific internalization accounted for approximately 20% of the internalized ligand at all concentrations). Degraded and intact (recycled) radiolabeled ligands in the medium were separated using an 8-ml column of Sephadex G-15 and quantified with a Packard 5000 series γ-counter. The first elution peak represented undegraded EGF, while the second peak was degraded EGF composed mainly of monoiodotyrosine (Carpenter and Cohen, 1976; Wiley and Cunningham, 1982). The sorting fraction or percent recycled was defined as the radioactivity in the first peak divided by the total radioactivity collected from the column. Sorting fractions at each of the three time points (5, 10, and 15 min) were averaged to calculate the overall sorting fraction for each experiment. The observed degradation rate was calculated by quantifying the radioactivity in the second peak, dividing by the chase time to get the number of molecules degraded per min per cell, and averaging over each of the time points. Values of the observed degradation rate constants were calculated by dividing the observed degradation rate by the number of intracellular ligand molecules per cell. TGFα, mEGF, and hEGF are all members of the EGF family and bind to the EGFR. Association experiments were performed with these ligands and several site-directed recombinant hEGF mutants to determine how their association and dissociation rate constants were affected by changes in pH. Following pretreatment with PAO, cells were incubated at 37°C with 1.7 nM125I-ligand in buffer either at pH 7.4 or pH 6 mimicking the different pH environments on the cell surface and in early endosomes (Mellman et al., 1986; Sorkin et al., 1988). The amount of surface-bound ligand was monitored as a function of time. A plot of the number of surface-associated ligands per cell versus time was fit to determine the association and dissociation rate constants (Lauffenburger and Linderman, 1993). Fig. 1 presents composite association curves for three experiments with hEGF, mEGF, and TGFα at pH 7.4 and pH 6. The association rate constant dominated the initial slope of these curves while the ratio of the dissociation to association rate constants controlled the shape of the curve after several minutes. Average individual rate constants at pH 7.4 and 6 were determined from a minimum of three separate experiments for each of the different ligands (Table 1). Individual association and dissociation rate constants were used to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the different ligands at both pH 7.4 and pH 6 (Fig. 2A). The ratio of Kd values in pH 6 buffer to Kd values in pH 7.4 buffer provided a measurement of the pH sensitivity of each ligand's binding constants. Although mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα had roughly equivalent Kd values at pH 7.4, the ratio of hEGF Kd values in pH 6 and pH 7.4 environments was 4.5 times greater than that of mEGF, while the ratio for TGFα was 9 times greater than that of mEGF (Fig. 2B).Tabled 1Figure 2:Equilibrium dissociation constant values at pH 7.4 and pH 6. A, individual association and dissociation rate constants tabulated in Table 1 were used to calculate equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) at pH 7.4 (□) and pH 6 (•).

Sorting events were isolated from surface binding effects by plotting the sorting fractions versus the number of intracellular ligands per cell rather than the incubation concentration. mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα exhibited different sorting patterns as the number of intracellular ligands per cell was varied over 3 orders of magnitude (Fig. 3). The fraction of mEGF which was recycled increased from approximately 45% to 80% as the number of intracellular ligands per cell rose from about 400 to 100,000. In striking contrast, the fraction of TGFα which was recycled decreased slightly from 55% to 48% over the same range of intracellular ligand levels. The sorting outcome for hEGF appeared fairly insensitive to changes in intracellular ligand levels, and a relatively constant fraction (56-59%) of hEGF was recycled over the same range of intracellular ligand levels. Binding affinities and sorting fractions can be compared to receptor down-regulation levels to help provide some basic insights into trafficking dynamics. We found that 27%, 34%, and 65% of the original numbers of surface receptors remain following a 2-h incubation in 100 ng/ml mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα, respectively. These measurements correspond well with down-regulation results in B82 cells reported by Chen et al.(1989) for mEGF and by Ebner and Derynck(1991) for hEGF and TGFα. Since EGFRs internalize at similar rates when bound by mEGF, hEGF, or TGFα, the observed differences in down-regulation imply that slightly more receptors recycle when internalized with hEGF than with mEGF, and significantly more receptors recycle when internalized with TGFα than with either mEGF or hEGF. These findings also correlate well with the extent of endosomal receptor/ligand complex dissociation measured for the various ligands since unoccupied EGFRs predominantly recycle (Herbst et al., 1994). The intracellular trafficking of several site-directed recombinant hEGF mutants was also investigated. Tyrosine 13 is a highly conserved amino acid in EGF-like proteins and appears to play an important role in contributing to the hydrophobic binding site environment of EGF and its receptor (Tadaki and Niyogi, 1993). Glutamate 40 is involved in binding by virtue of its proximity to the crucial arginine 41 residue (Campion et al., 1992). The binding parameters of several mutants generated at these residues were evaluated. E40A, Y13H, and Y13G retained approximately 5%, 10%, and 2% of the affinity of hEGF at pH 7.4, respectively (Table 1). These mutants had larger equilibrium dissociation constants than hEGF in pH 6 environments (Fig. 2). Steady-state sorting experiments were performed with these hEGF mutants. Differences in surface binding (pH 7.4) were normalized by plotting the sorting fractions versus the number of intracellular ligands per cell rather than the incubation concentration. This approach isolated intracellular sorting behavior from surface binding and internalization events and allowed the sorting behavior of different ligands to be compared in cells with similar amounts of intracellular ligands. Sorting patterns of the mutants were different from the sorting pattern of hEGF (Fig. 4) and showed a slightly negative relationship to increasing intracellular ligand levels per cell analogous to TGFα's sorting behavior, although their actual sorting fractions were higher than the sorting fractions of TGFα. The observed degradation rate constant (kh) is a lumped kinetic parameter describing the proteolytic and transport processes ligands undergo as they move through the degradation pathway. Values of kh were measured for mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα (Fig. 5). Parallel plates of fibroblasts were first incubated for 2 h in labeled ligand at 37°C and then chased with an excess of unlabeled ligand. The accumulation of degradation products in the medium was monitored at 5-, 10-, and 15-min intervals during the chase, and the numbers of ligand molecules degraded per min per cell for each of the time points were averaged. Values of observed degradation rate constants were calculated by dividing the number of ligand molecules degraded per min per cell by the number of intracellular ligand molecules per cell. Values of kh for both mEGF and hEGF decreased as functions of increasing intracellular ligand levels. In contrast, the values of kh for TGFα remained relatively constant. Values of kh were also measured for the hEGF mutants and compared to the values of kh for hEGF (Fig. 6). Values of kh for the hEGF mutants were insensitive to increasing numbers of intracellular ligand molecules and were lower than hEGF kh values. Although the values of kh for hEGF mutants and TGFα were all fairly insensitive to changes in intracellular ligand levels, the magnitudes of the kh values of the hEGF mutants were significantly lower than those for TGFα. Several examples exist of receptor mutations which alter receptor/ligand interactions and consequently change the intracellular trafficking of receptor/ligand complexes. A deletion mutant of the LDL receptor was constructed which did not release its ligand in the low pH environment of the endosome and consequently was rapidly degraded rather than recycled (Davis et al., 1987). A receptor mutant with similar abnormal ligand binding and trafficking properties was later found in a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (Miyake et al., 1989). Another example is a mutant insulin receptor isolated in a patient with severe insulin-resistant diabetes (Kadowaki et al., 1988). This receptor was characterized and found not to release insulin efficiently in the acidic environment of the endosome. This failure to release its ligand resulted in the receptor being degraded rather than recycled (Kadowaki et al., 1990). We have investigated how different ligand properties influence the endosomal sorting of internalized EGF/receptor complexes. Several members of the EGF family are sorted quite differently in the endosome even though they are all internalized with the EGF receptor. The association and dissociation rate constants of these ligands measured at pH 6 are useful in interpreting the different endosomal sorting outcomes. Coupling association and steady-state sorting experiments yields increased understanding of how ligand properties directly affect the intracellular trafficking of the ligand and its receptor. mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα are members of the EGF family which bind to EGFRs with similar affinity at pH 7.4, but their binding is differentially affected by the low pH endosomal environment (Fig. 2). For example, the dissociation rate constant of TGFα was 9 times larger at pH 6 than at pH 7.4 while the dissociation rate constants of mEGF and hEGF were only 3 to 4 times larger. pH sensitivity of the binding parameters was assessed using a ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants in pH 6 buffer to the equilibrium dissociation constants in pH 7.4 buffer. The ratio of hEGF Kd values in pH 6 and pH 7.4 buffers was 4.5 times greater than that of mEGF, while the ratio for TGFα was 9 times greater than that of mEGF. The large difference in the pH sensitivity of binding between mEGF and TGFα correlated well with experimental data reported by other investigators. Using a permeabilization technique, Sorkin et al.(1988) found that the majority of internalized mEGF molecules remained complexed with receptors. In contrast, Korc and Finman (1989) and Ebner and Derynck(1991) observed that TGFα dissociated within the endosome to a much greater extent than EGF. These three ligands exhibited quite different sorting patterns as the numbers of intracellular ligands per cell were varied over 3 orders of magnitude (Fig. 3). The affinity of mEGF for the EGFR is fairly insensitive to endosomal pH, and the majority of mEGF remains bound to its receptor. Correspondingly, the fraction of internalized mEGF which was recycled rose from 45% to 80% as the increasing number of intracellular complexes saturated the endosomes' ability to target complexes to the lysosomes for degradation (French et al., 1994). In contrast, the affinity of TGFα for the EGFR is very sensitive to the lower pH environment in the endosome, and TGFα is largely dissociated from its receptor. Its sorting pattern is distinctly different from the saturating behavior observed with mEGF and may simply reflect the partitioning of fluid-phase ligands. The sorting behavior of hEGF is intermediate between the two extremes of ligands almost completely complexed with receptors (mEGF) and ligands almost completely dissociated from receptors (TGFα). This finding correlates well with hEGF's intermediate sensitivity to lower pH levels and suggests that the sorting outcomes of hEGF may represent the integration of many short-lived interactions between the ligand and its receptor. These three EGF ligands demonstrate that at high intracellular ligand concentrations a 5- to 10-fold increase in the binding affinity's pH sensitivity can decrease the percentage of the intracellular ligand that is recycled from 80% down to 50%. Observed degradation rate constants measured for mEGF, hEGF, and TGFα also illustrate that the intracellular trafficking of EGF ligands may be directly influenced by the differing pH sensitivities of their binding properties. The observed degradation rate constant represents a lumped kinetic parameter describing the rate at which labeled ligand moves from early endosomes to lysosomes, is degraded, and is transported out of the cell. Values of kh for mEGF decreased as a function of increasing intracellular ligand levels. This trend corresponds well with the mEGF sorting fractions and supports the hypothesis that endosomal targeting of mEGF complexes to degradation is saturated at high intracellular ligand levels. In contrast, values of kh for TGFα remained relatively constant suggesting that the degradation of TGFα is the result of a nonspecific process and appears to be simply proportional to the number of internalized TGFα molecules. The values of kh for hEGF fell between the values for mEGF and TGFα indicating that some specific endosomal targeting of hEGF was being saturated but not to the same extent as for mEGF. Both the steady-state endosomal sorting patterns and observed degradation rate constants of these EGF ligands illustrate how different receptor-ligand interactions in the low pH endosomal environment can change the intracellular trafficking of the ligands. The differences observed in trafficking between hEGF and mEGF may be related to sequence differences between these ligands. hEGF, unlike mEGF, shares several histidine residues (10 and 16) with TGFα (Carpenter and Wahl, 1990) conferring a greater sensitivity to changes in pH. Binding differences between mEGF and hEGF at the low pH levels found in endosomes result in altered intracellular trafficking as evidenced by different steady-state sorting patterns and observed degradation rate constants. Single amino acid substitutions in hEGF result in altered intracellular trafficking which correlates with changes in the binding properties of the mutants at pH 6. The hEGF mutants have dissociation rate constants at pH 6 that are roughly 3 times larger than that of hEGF. When the number of intracellular ligands per cell is low, 10-15% more of the internalized mutant hEGF is recycled than hEGF. Degradation rate constants for the mutants were about half the magnitude of hEGF values at low intracellular ligand levels and were much less sensitive to changes in intracellular ligand levels. These differences between the intracellular trafficking of hEGF mutants and hEGF, which were most distinct at low intracellular ligand levels, illustrate the direct relationship between the altered binding of these mutants at endosomal pH levels and sorting outcomes. Although the mutants' binding properties at pH 6 were similar to those of TGFα, larger percentages of the hEGF mutants were recycled, and their kh values were significantly lower at all intracellular ligand levels than TGFα. Interpretation of the differences observed in steady-state sorting measurements between the low affinity hEGF mutants and hEGF may be complicated by several factors. The sorting fraction reflects not only accumulation of degraded ligand and dissociated recycled ligand in the medium but also dissociation of residual, noninternalized ligand from the cell surface. This potential distortion was minimized by using an acid-strip during the experiment to remove most of the noninternalized, surface-associated ligand before the measurements were made, and we have previously established that the experimental sorting fraction does accurately represent the true percentage of recycled mEGF (French et al., 1994). The low affinity mutants dissociate from the surface faster than mEGF (kr = 0.4 to 1.2 min-1 for hEGF mutants, kr = 0.3 min-1 for mEGF). This may skew measurements of the low affinity mutants' sorting fractions artificially higher as any residual, noninternalized ligand will dissociate more rapidly. Another factor which may distort the sorting fractions of the mutants is that a larger fraction of the endosomal ligand is nonspecifically internalized. This effectively raises the endosomal concentration of ligand relative to the number of intracellular receptors and may alter the dynamics of the interactions within endosomes skewing the sorting fraction lower. However, observed degradation rate constants should not be influenced by increased dissociation from the surface during the measurements, and the impact of increased nonspecific internalization should be to increase degradation rate constants. Measured degradation rate constants of the low affinity mutants were significantly lower than hEGF values demonstrating that the intracellular trafficking of the hEGF mutants is indeed altered compared to hEGF. These experiments show that changes in ligand binding properties can quantitatively modify endosomal sorting outcomes. Ligands of the EGF family, which are all internalized bound to the EGFR, undergo different intracellular processing that may account for differences that have been observed in cellular response (Schreiber et al., 1986; Korc et al., 1987; Brenner et al., 1989). Single amino acid substitutions can modulate endosomal sorting outcomes by changing the growth factor's binding properties at low pH levels. This suggests that ligands may be genetically engineered to achieve desired changes in intracellular trafficking and thereby potentially modify cellular response. A more rigorous understanding of how ligand properties govern trafficking may facilitate improved therapeutic interventions in areas such as wound healing, cancer treatment, and tissue regeneration (Lauffenburger, 1994).

A myristoyl or related N-acyl group covalently attached to the amino terminus of recoverin enables it to bind to disc membranes when the Ca2+ level is elevated. Ca2+-bound recoverin prolongs the lifetime of photoexcited rhodopsin, most likely by blocking its phosphorylation. We report here Ca2+ binding studies of myristoylated and unmyristoylated recombinant recoverin using flow dialysis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. Unmyristoylated recoverin exhibits heterogeneous and uncooperative binding of two Ca2+ with dissociation constants of 0.11 and 6.9 μM. In contrast, two Ca2+ bind cooperatively to myristoylated recoverin with a Hill coefficient of 1.75 and an apparent dissociation constant of 17 μM. Thus, the attached myristoyl group lowers the calcium affinity of the protein and induces cooperativity in Ca2+ binding. One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 15N-1H shift correlation NMR spectra of myristoylated recoverin measured as a function of Ca2+ concentration show that a concerted conformational change occurs when two Ca2+ are bound. The Ca2+ binding and NMR data can be fit to a concerted allosteric model in which the two Ca2+ binding sites have different affinities in both the T and R states. The T and R conformational states are defined in terms of the Ca2+-myristoyl switch; in the T state, the myristoyl group is sequestered inside the protein, whereas in the R state, the myristoyl group is extruded. Ca2+ binds to the R state at least 10,000-fold more tightly than to T. In this model, the dissociation constants of the two sites in the R state of the myristoylated protein are 0.11 and 6.9 μM, as in unmyristoylated recoverin. The ratio of the unliganded form of T to that of R is estimated to be 400 for myristoylated and <0.05 for unmyristoylated recoverin.

https://openalex.org/W2047457443,"To understand the mechanism of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) activation in apoptosis, we analyzed the expression of ICE mRNA in two human cell lines by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. This resulted in the identification and cloning of four alternatively spliced ICE mRNA isoforms. Although all the alternative splicing events were within the coding sequence of ICE, the four ICE isoforms maintained open reading frames and were designated as ICEβ, γ, δ, and ∊. In ICEγ, most of the propeptide (amino acids 20-112) is deleted, which suggests that it may function as a catalyst for ICE autoprocessing in vivo. In ICEδ, amino acids 288-335, which contain the cleavage sites between the p20 and p10 subunits of ICE, are deleted thus resulting in its inactivation. Intriguingly, in ICE∊ amino acids 20-335, which encompass most of the propeptide and the p20 subunit, are deleted resulting in the formation of a molecule that is homologous to the p10 subunit. Examination of the ability of these four ICE isoforms to cause apoptosis revealed that only the parental ICEα and isoforms β and γ, but not isoforms δ and ∊, can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. In addition, coexpression of the p20 and p10 but not the p20 and ICE∊ in Sf9 cells results in apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of ICE∊ and to a lesser degree ICEδ resulted in extension of the survival of baculovirus-infected cells in a manner similar to expression of BCL2. The ability of ICE∊ to extend the survival of Sf9 cells suggests that baculovirusinduced apoptosis in these cells is mediated by an ICE-like protease. We show that ICE∊ can bind to the p20 subunit of ICE and potentially may compete with the p10 subunit to form an inactive ICE complex. Therefore, by acting as a dominant inhibitor of ICE activity, ICE∊ may regulate ICE activation in vivo. To understand the mechanism of interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) activation in apoptosis, we analyzed the expression of ICE mRNA in two human cell lines by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. This resulted in the identification and cloning of four alternatively spliced ICE mRNA isoforms. Although all the alternative splicing events were within the coding sequence of ICE, the four ICE isoforms maintained open reading frames and were designated as ICEβ, γ, δ, and ∊. In ICEγ, most of the propeptide (amino acids 20-112) is deleted, which suggests that it may function as a catalyst for ICE autoprocessing in vivo. In ICEδ, amino acids 288-335, which contain the cleavage sites between the p20 and p10 subunits of ICE, are deleted thus resulting in its inactivation. Intriguingly, in ICE∊ amino acids 20-335, which encompass most of the propeptide and the p20 subunit, are deleted resulting in the formation of a molecule that is homologous to the p10 subunit. Examination of the ability of these four ICE isoforms to cause apoptosis revealed that only the parental ICEα and isoforms β and γ, but not isoforms δ and ∊, can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. In addition, coexpression of the p20 and p10 but not the p20 and ICE∊ in Sf9 cells results in apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of ICE∊ and to a lesser degree ICEδ resulted in extension of the survival of baculovirus-infected cells in a manner similar to expression of BCL2. The ability of ICE∊ to extend the survival of Sf9 cells suggests that baculovirusinduced apoptosis in these cells is mediated by an ICE-like protease. We show that ICE∊ can bind to the p20 subunit of ICE and potentially may compete with the p10 subunit to form an inactive ICE complex. Therefore, by acting as a dominant inhibitor of ICE activity, ICE∊ may regulate ICE activation in vivo.

Sequence homology between ICE and the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene product CED-3 suggests that mammalian ICE or its homologs might be involved in apoptosis. The two proteins share an overall 28% sequence identity (10Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar).

A significant homology between ICE or CED-3 and a newly discovered mouse protein known as Nedd2 was also demonstrated in a recent study(11Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

The cDNAs for individual ICE isoforms were cloned by a combination of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction techniques (RT-PCR). Reverse transcription was performed on poly(A)+ RNA from the human T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat or total RNA from the human monocyte cell line THP-1 using a synthetic primer (ICE-RT) derived from the 3′ untranslated sequence of human ICE (3Cerretti D.P.

The reverse transcription products were then used as templates for PCR using two nested ICE-specific primers ICE1 and ICE2 (see Fig. 1). Primer sequences were as follows: ICE-RT, CAGAACGATCTCTTCAC; ICE1, ATGGCCGACAAGGTCCTG; ICE2, CCTGCCCGCAGACATTCA. The amplified DNA was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then fractionated on low melting point agarose gels. Several DNA fragments ranging in size from 0.3 to 1.3 kb were observed after staining the gel with ethidium bromide. After confirming that all these DNA fragments contain ICE sequences by Southern blot analysis with an ICE-specific probe, they were excised from the gel and cloned into a SmaI-cut pBluescript II KS+ vector (Stratagene). The cloned cDNAs were then sequenced with T3 and T7 sequencing primers and other ICE-specific primers. The largest clone corresponding to the published ICE sequence (3Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J.

The other ICE clones were designated as KS-ICEβ, KS-ICEγ, KS-ICEδ, and KS-ICE∊ based on decreasing size. As outlined above, cDNAs of all ICE isoforms were cloned in the SmaI site of pBluescript II KS+ plasmid vector under the T7 promoter. The cDNAs for the p20 and p10 subunits were obtained by PCR using synthetic primers (ICE1 and p20TAA for p20; p10ATG and ICE2 for p10) and KS-ICEγ as a template. The sequence of the p20TAA primer is GGTTTCCAGAAACTCCTACTTAATC and the p10ATG primer is ATGGCTATTAAGAAAGCCCACATA. The amplified DNA fragments were blunt-ended, phosphorylated, and then cloned in the SmaI site of pBluescript II KS+ vector under the T7 promoter and designated as KS-p10 and KS-p20. The cDNA fragments corresponding to ICEα, β, γ, δ, ∊, p20, and p10 were excised from their corresponding Bluescript vectors with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and subcloned into a BamHI/EcoRI-cut pVL1393 to generate the corresponding recombinant transfer vectors. These recombinant transfer vectors were then used to generate recombinant baculoviruses as described previously(15Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar, 16Alnemri E.S. Maksymowych A.B. Robertson N.M. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3925-3936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The five KS-ICE or KS-p10 vectors were linearized with EcoRI and then used as templates for T7 RNA polymerase. The in vitro synthesized mRNA was precipitated by ethanol, dried and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). In vitro translation was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 80 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and 200 μg/ml in vitro transcribed mRNA. The translation products were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The p20 cDNA was subcloned in-frame into the BamHI site of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The p20 cDNA was obtained by PCR using synthetic primers p20GEX and p20TAA and KS-ICEγ as a template. The sequence of p20GEX primer is GGGATCCTGAACCCAGCTATGCCCACATCC. The amplified DNA fragment was blunt-ended, phosphorylated, and then cloned in the SmaI site of pBluescript II KS+ vector under the T7 promoter. The cDNA fragment was then excised from the Bluescript vectors with BamHI and then subcloned in a BamHI-cut pGEX-5X-3. The expression plasmid PGEX-p20 was introduced into E. coli DH5α, and protein expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Exponentially growing bacteria carrying the expression plasmid PGEX-p20 was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h and then lysed by sonication. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase-p20 present in the bacterial lysate was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose resin for 10 min at room temperature and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The immobilized p20 fusion protein was incubated with reticulocyte lysates containing 35S-labeled p10 or ICE∊ for 1 h at 30°C and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Laemmli sample buffer was then added to the resin, and the eluted proteins were analyzed on a 5-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and visualized by autoradiography. Employing RT-PCR to analyze the expression of ICE mRNA in the human Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell line, several DNA products of 1248, 1185, 969, 825, and 300 bp were detected by ethidium bromide staining. The two largest PCR products were the most abundant. All five products were detected by Southern blot hybridization using the full-length ICE cDNA as a probe (data not shown). This pattern of RT-PCR products was also observed using total RNA from the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Subsequently, the two largest PCR products (1185 and 1248 bp) were cloned from Jurkat mRNA and the three smaller less abundant products (300, 825, and 969 bp), which represent 10-15% of the larger products, were cloned from THP-1 mRNA. All cloned PCR products were then sequenced (Fig. 1). The largest form (1248 bp) corresponds to the sequence of the full-length ICE as reported previously (3Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B.

Intriguingly, sequence analysis of the four smaller PCR products revealed that these forms were generated by independent alternative splicing events of the parental ICE mRNA transcript. Table 1 lists the splice donor and acceptor sequences of the human ICE gene (17Cerretti D.P. Hollingsworth L.T. Kozlosky C.J. Valentine M.B. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Nelson N. Genomics. 1994; 20: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that are utilized to generate the four ICE isoforms. All the splice junction sequences within the splice donor and acceptor sites conform to the consensus GT/AG rule (Table 1). The 1185-bp cDNA, designated as ICEβ, lacks the entire exon 3 of the ICE gene (bp 275-338; amino acids 92-112) (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). The 969-bp cDNA, designated as ICEγ, lacks most of exon 2 and the entire exon 3 (bp 59-338; amino acids 20-112). The 825-bp cDNA, designated as ICEδ is similar to ICEγ but also lacks the entire exon 7 (bp 863-1006; amino acids 288-335). The smallest 300-bp cDNA, designated as ICE∊ lacks most of exon 2 and exons 3 to 7 (bp 59-1006; amino acids 20-335). All these alternatively spliced ICE isoforms maintained an open reading frame, which gave rise to different translation products (Fig. 3A). ICE proenzyme (ICEα here) requires proteolytic cleavage to generate p20 and p10 subunits for enzymatic activation(4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

It is not yet clear whether ICE activation occurs via an intramolecular autoprocessing mechanism or requires limited proteolysis by an unknown protease(4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Ellison K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C.

However, it has been shown that active ICE heterodimer can cleave reticulocyte lysate translated proICE to generate the p20 and p10 subunits(4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Ellison K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M.

Because ICE isoforms β, γ, and δ contain the active site Cys-285 but lack part or most of the 119 N-terminal propeptide it was interesting to determine whether these isoforms possess autoprocessing activity. ICE isoforms α, β, γ, and δ were in vitro transcribed and translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Translation of ICE mRNA isoforms gave rise to 30-48-kDa translation products (Fig. 3A). We also detected a major 34-kDa product in ICEα and ICEβ translation reactions (Fig. 3A, lanes α and β). This p34 product is similar in size to the ICEγ translation product (lane γ) and could be a processed ICEα and β. However, all these products were stable for 24 h in reticulocyte lysates at room temperature (Fig. 3B). No decrease in the intensity of the 30-48-kDa translation products or appearance of a p20 species was observed after this prolonged incubation (Fig. 3B, lanes α-δ). In addition, incubation of ICEα with ICEγ or ICEδ, or incubation of ICEγ with ICEδ for 24 h at room temperature did not result in processing of these isoforms to the p20 and p10 subunits (Fig. 3B). The stability of the ICE isoforms suggests that ICE isoforms do not possess autocatalytic activity under these in vitro conditions.Tabled 1Figure 2:Structure and alternative splicing of ICE mRNA.

The viability of infected cells was determined at various times post-infection. As shown in Fig. 4A, the viability of Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant ICEα baculovirus decreased sharply 24-48 h post-infection. Similar effects were also observed with ICEβ and ICEγ (Fig. 4B). In contrast, cells infected with the wild type virus, ICEδ, ICE∊ or BCL2 baculoviruses showed very little decrease in viability during this period (Fig. 4, A and B). The decrease in viability of cells infected with the recombinant ICEα, β, and γ baculoviruses was due to induction of apoptosis when the recombinant ICE proteins started to rise 24-48 h post-infection. This period is the time at which proteins under the polyhedrin promoter are induced. During this period, cells expressing ICEα, β, or γ showed characteristic signs of apoptosis including cytoplasmic membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and internucleosomal DNA cleavage (Fig. 4C, lanes α, β, and γ). These apoptotic signs were not observed in Sf9 cells infected with ICEδ or ∊ baculoviruses (Fig. 4C, lanes δ and ∊) or with the wild type (Fig. 4C, lane WT) or BCL2 baculoviruses(18Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In fact, it was surprising to discover that expression of ICE∊ and to a lesser degree ICEδ conferred some protection and delayed the apoptotic response to baculovirus infection (Fig. 4A). In this experiment, cells infected with ICE∊ baculovirus showed a lesser decrease in viability compared to cells infected with the wild type virus (Fig. 4A). This protective effect was similar to that observed with the expression of BCL2 in these cells (Fig. 4A and (18Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Coexpression of ICEα with BCL2 or ICE∊ resulted in a slight delay in the onset of apoptosis, but was not protective. Because of the lethality of ICEα, we detected a significantly lower expression of BCL2 or ICE∊ in this coexpression experiment (data not shown). Because ICE∊ is homologous to the p10 subunit of active ICE (Fig. 5), we decided to test whether its coexpression with the p20 subunit could generate an active ICE heterodimer. As shown in Table 2, expression of either the p10, p20, or ICE∊ in Sf9 cells does not cause apoptosis. On the other hand, coexpression of the p10 and p20 subunits resulted in apoptosis within the same time frame as did ICEα. In contrast, coexpression of ICE∊ and p20 does not cause apoptosis in Sf9 cells. These results suggest that the first 19 amino acids of the p10 subunit are essential for ICE activity. Substitution of these amino acids as in ICE∊ may result in loss of activity.Tabled 1 To determine whether ICE∊ can interact with p20, ICE∊ was in vitro transcribed and then translated in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The labeled ICE∊ was then incubated with a glutathione S-transferase-p20 fusion protein expressed in bacteria and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin. The p10 subunit was also labeled in reticulocyte lysate with 35S and used as a control. As shown in Fig. 6, both p10 and ICE∊ were able to interact with the glutathione S-transferase-p20 fusion protein (lanes +). A small amount of p10 and ICE∊ were bound nonspecifically to free glutathione-Sepharose resin (lanes -). These results suggest that ICE∊ can form a heterodimer with p20 and may regulate its activity in vivo by forming an inactive complex. In this report we have identified and characterized four human ICE mRNA isoforms. These four cDNAs result from one or more alternative splicing events involving exons 2-7 of the ICE gene (17Cerretti D.P. Hollingsworth L.T. Kozlosky C.J. Valentine M.B. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Nelson N. Genomics. 1994; 20: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). In ICEβ the deletion of exon 3 resulted from splicing of the DNA sequence between exons 2 and 4 using intron 2 splice donor and intron 3 splice acceptor (Table 1 and (17Cerretti D.P. Hollingsworth L.T. Kozlosky C.J. Valentine M.B. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Nelson N. Genomics. 1994; 20: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, the deletion of exon 7 in ICEδ resulted from splicing of the DNA sequence between exon 6 and 8 using intron 6 splice donor and intron 7 splice acceptor (Table 1 and (17Cerretti D.P. Hollingsworth L.T. Kozlosky C.J. Valentine M.B. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Nelson N. Genomics. 1994; 20: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the deletions within exons 2-7 in ICEγ, δ, and ∊ resulted from the use of an alternative splice donor located within the coding sequence of exon 2 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). However, in ICEγ and δ intron 3 splice acceptor was used, whereas in ICE∊ intron 7 splice acceptor was used (Table 1). When expressed in Sf9 cells, two of these isoforms, ICEβ and ICEγ had similar activity to the parental ICEα isoform. The deletion of 21 or 93 amino acids from the N-terminal propeptide in ICEβ and ICEγ, respectively, had no effect on their ability to induce apoptosis in Sf9 cells. This is not surprising since the propeptide is not required for ICE activity. The ability of these isoforms to cause apoptosis was associated with complete processing of their respective precursor peptides to the p20 and p10 subunits. Only p20 and p10 subunits but no precursors were detected in Sf9 cells expressing ICEα, β, or γ at 48 h post-infection (data not shown). This suggests that Sf9 cells may contain a protease that can cleave proICE, or that proICE itself possesses an autocatalytic activity. So far the mechanism by which proICE is post-translationally processed to the active ICE heterodimer is not known. It is also not clear whether the propeptide influences the kinetics by which the ICE heterodimer is generated. There is some evidence that active ICE is generated by an autoprocessing mechanism. Thornberry et al.(4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Ellison K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar) demonstrated that purified active ICE heterodimer can cleave the in vitro translated p45 proICE molecule, to generate several intermediates including the p34, p20, and p10 forms. They also demonstrated that the p45 proICE is stable for a prolonged incubation at room temperature, suggesting that p45 lacks an intramolecular autoprocessing activity(4Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Ellison K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.-F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C. Raju S.M. Rolando A.M. Salley J.P. Yamin T.-T. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. MacCross M. Mumford R.A. Schmidt J.A. Tocci M.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our findings that in vitro translated proICEα, β, and γ, were stable for a prolonged period of time. Nevertheless, our in vitro translation reactions seemed to contain intermediate p34 species in proICEα and β reactions, similar in size to proICEγ, but not in ICEδ reaction. This suggests that proICEα or β may have partial intramolecular autoprocessing activity and that the first step in autoprocessing of ICE, is removal of the propeptide. In a recent study, Wilson et al.(5Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thompson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) stated that purified p45, and the p30 (p34 here) form which lacks the N-terminal propeptide, can autoprocess to the active form in vitro, by manipulation of the enzyme concentrations and temperature(5Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thompson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). They also demonstrated that a mutant p30 (p34 here) in which the active site Cys285 has been changed to Ala was inactive and was not processed to the p20/p10 heterodimer in vivo. Therefore, whether active ICE heterodimer is generated by an intra- or intermolecular processing mechanism, we believe that the removal of the propeptide sequence may accelerate the autoprocessing mechanism. The removal of most of the propeptide at the level of mRNA splicing as in ICEγ, may provide a p34 ICE species that can be more readily converted to active ICE heterodimer than the full-length p45 species. Therefore, ICEγ may act as an in vivo catalyst for generation of active ICE heterodimer. Once an active ICE heterodimer is generated, it may then act on the p45 species and convert it to the active form. Another way by which ICE activity may be regulated is at the level of formation of ICE heterodimer. The ICE∊ cDNA codes for a protein which corresponds to the p10 subunit of ICE except for the first 19 amino acids, which are derived from exon 2 in ICE∊, and from exon 7 in the p10 subunit (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 5). We have demonstrated that ICE∊, like the p10 subunit, can form a heterodimer with the p20 subunit. The crystal structure of ICE complexed to a tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitor suggests that the side chains of p10 residues Val-338 to Pro-343 interact with the inhibitor, except for Ser-339(5Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thompson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Although all these residues are present in ICE∊, the ICE∊/p20 heterodimer is inactive. This could be attributed to the fact that active ICE exists as a (p20)2/(p10)2 tetramer in which the participation of p10 residues 318-322 in the formation of this tetrameric complex is essential(5Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thompson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Because 4 of these residues are substituted in ICE∊ (Fig. 5), this may prevent the formation of a (p20)2/(ICE∊)2 tetramer. The biological significance of the expression of an alternatively spliced ICE∊ isoform is realized from its ability to modulate ICE activity. ICE∊ might compete with p10 for binding to p20 in vivo. This could be why overexpression of ICE∊ in Sf9 cells resulted in a delay of apoptosis in a fashion similar to or even better than BCL2 expression. Insect Sf9 cells apparently express an ICE-like protein which might be involved in insect cell apoptosis. Support for the existence of an ICE-like molecule in Sf9 cells was obtained from our overexpression studies of pro-IL-1β. Overexpression of pro-IL-1β in Sf9 cells resulted in its cleavage to the 17.5-kDa active IL-1β cytokine. 2E. S. Alnemri, T. Fernandes-Alnemri, and G. Litwack, manuscript in preparation. Three ICE mRNA species (2.5, 1.9, and 0.5 kb) have been detected in THP-1 cell line and several other normal human tissues, including peripheral blood monocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood neutrophils, resting and activated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, and placenta(3Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Black R.A. Science. 1992; 256: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). We believe that the smallest 0.5-kb mRNA is the ICE∊ isoform. ICE∊ transcript is highly expressed in peripheral blood neutrophils and placenta(3Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Mosley B. Nelson N. Van Ness K. Greenstreet T.A. March C.J. Kronheim S.R. Druck T. Cannizzaro L.A. Huebner K. Black R.A. Science. 1992; 256: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The significance of this high level of expression is not yet established. We speculate that, by acting as a dominant inhibitor, ICE∊ may inhibit ICE activity thus indirect regulating apoptosis in these tissues. Regulation of the biological activity of a protein by alternative splicing is a well known phenomenon(19Sharp P.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Examples where alternative splicing has contributed to different apoptotic activities are found in the gene products of bclx(20Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) and grb2(21Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.-C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Nature. 1994; 264: 971-974Google Scholar). The bclx gene is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, Bclx-l and Bclx-s(20Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). The Bclx-s isoform lacks 63 amino acids as a result of internal splicing within the first coding exon of the bclx gene(20Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Whereas Bclx-l protects cells from apoptosis, Bclx-s has an opposite effect(20Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). This is probably due to forming of an inactive heterodimer with Bcl2 or Bclx-l. The Grb2 isoform Grb3-3 has a deletion in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain as a result of alternative splicing of one exon(21Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.-C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Nature. 1994; 264: 971-974Google Scholar). Grb3-3 has been shown to cause apoptosis in Swiss 3T3 cells by acting as a dominant inhibitor of Grb2 function, probably by forming an inactive heterodimeric complex with other protein partners(21Fath I. Schweighoffer F. Rey I. Multon M.-C. Boiziau J. Duchesne M. Tocqué B. Nature. 1994; 264: 971-974Google Scholar). In conclusion, the ICE isoforms described here are another example where the biological activity of a protein was altered by alternative splicing. This is an important tissue-specific regulatory mechanism. Deregulation of alternative splicing of the ICE gene in certain tissues could result in abnormal levels of ICE activity. Understanding of this mechanism could contribute significantly to our knowledge of this important enzyme. This is especially important in the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, where ICE activity might be elevated(22Griffin W.S. Stanley L.C.

Two models have been proposed to explain this. In the first model, induced internalization expands the intracellular pool of receptors, leading to enhanced lysosomal targeting. The second model proposes that activation of intrinsic receptor kinase activity induces inward vesiculation of endosomes, thus interrupting receptor recycling. To test these models, we created EGFR mutants that lack the conserved tyrosine kinase domain, but retain different parts of the distal carboxyl terminus regulatory region. Mutants lacking all distal regulatory sequences underwent slow internalization (0.02 min−1) and turnover (t1/2∼ 24 h), similar to unoccupied, holo-EGFR. Mutant receptors that lacked the kinase domain, but retained the entire distal regulatory domain, were constitutively internalized and targeted to lysosomes, even in the absence of EGF. The turnover of these receptors (t1/2∼ 11 h) was similar to that of occupied, kinase-active holo-EGFR (t1/2∼ 9.5 h). These results show that receptor tyrosine kinase activity is not required for the targeting of EGFR to lysosomes. Receptor mutants which expressed previously identified endocytic sequences underwent rapid internalization. Unexpectedly, enhanced turnover of EGFR mutants required additional sequences located between residues 945 and 991 in the holo-EGFR. Thus, internalization and lysosomal targeting of EGFR are separate processes mediated by distinct sequences. Our results indicate that induced internalization is necessary, but not sufficient, for enhanced EGFR degradation. Instead, down-regulation requires exposure of previously cryptic internalization and lysosomal targeting sequences.

To gain some understanding in a simpler system of how the DnaJ and GrpE cochaperonins influence the activity of DnaK, we have examined the effect of the cochaperonins on the weak intrinsic ATPase activity of the molecular chaperone DnaK in the presence and absence of peptide effectors. We have found that random sequence peptide chains of 8 or 9 amino acid residues in length yield optimal (10-fold) activation of the DnaK ATPase, whereas peptides with 5 or fewer residues fail to stimulate the ATPase of this bacterial hsp70 homologue. Furthermore, we have discovered that those peptides that interact best with DnaK, as judged by their KA as activators of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK, also act as strong inhibitors of λ DNA replication in vitro. The inhibitory effect of peptides on λ DNA replication was overcome by increasing the concentration of DnaK in the replication system. Diminished inhibition was also found when the replication system was supplemented with GrpE cochaperonin, a protein known to increase the effectiveness of DnaK action in λ DNA replication. These and other results suggest that the peptide-binding site of DnaK is required for its function in λ DNA replication. Apparently, peptides sequester free DnaK protein and block λ DNA replication by reducing the amount of DnaK that is free to mediate disassembly of nucleoprotein preinitiation structures. In related studies, we have found that DnaJ, like short peptides, activates the intrinsic ATPase activity of DnaK. DnaJ, however, is substantially more potent in this regard, since it activates DnaK at concentrations 1000-fold below those required for a peptide of random sequence. By itself, the GrpE cochaperonin has no effect on the peptide-independent ATPase activity of DnaK, but GrpE does vigorously stimulate the peptide-dependent ATPase of the DnaK chaperone. Under steady-state conditions, the Vmax of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK was elevated approximately 40-fold by the presence of GrpE and saturating levels of peptides.

As members of the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptor family, α2AR share a number of conserved structural features including an extracellular amino terminus, an intracellular carboxyl terminus, and seven transmembrane-spanning domains linked by three extracellular loops and three intracellular loops(2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Studies that have used chimeric or mutated forms of G-protein coupled receptors have demonstrated the involvement of the transmembrane domains in ligand binding (3Liggett S.B. Raymond J.R. Bouloux P.-M.G. Catecholamines. Vol. 7. W. B. Saunders, London1993: 279-306Google Scholar) and the cytosolic domains in G-protein coupling (3Liggett S.B. Raymond J.R. Bouloux P.-M.G. Catecholamines. Vol. 7. W. B. Saunders, London1993: 279-306Google Scholar) and regulatory processes such as receptor sequestration, down-regulation, and phosphorylation(4Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 71-97Google Scholar).Receptor phosphorylation by a variety of kinases is one mechanism by which the phenomenon of desensitization, or refractoriness, of the stimulated receptor-mediated response develops during conditions of prolonged agonist exposure. There are essentially two classes of kinases which are involved in the phosphorylation of G-protein coupled receptors: those that are activated by second messenger production (e.g. cAMP-dependent protein kinases and protein kinase C) and those that are second messenger-independent (e.g. G-protein coupled receptor kinases). G-protein coupled receptor kinases phosphorylate the agonist-occupied form of G-protein coupled receptors at serine and threonine residues in the intracellular domains, typically the third intracellular loop or carboxyl terminus(5Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One such kinase, the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2In this report, βARK refers to the cloned bovine βARK, EC 2.7.1.126(6Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

However, as with other G-protein coupled receptors that are phosphorylated by βARK, the precise serine or threonine residues in α2C10 which are phosphorylated are not known. This is largely because of the lack of a defined consensus sequence for βARK-mediated phosphorylation. For the most part, attempts to delineate discrete residues within a receptor which are phosphorylated by βARK have been limited to the prototypical substrate, the β2AR. However, despite extensive deletion (20Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. DeBlasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) mutagenesis studies, the sites for βARK-mediated phosphorylation for the β2AR remain unidentified. Moreover, in an examination of the intracellular portions of the receptors that have been definitively shown to be phosphorylated by βARK, there are typically numerous serine and threonine residues and a low amino acid sequence homology between receptors.Previously, we have shown that removal of 75 amino acids(257-332), including nine serine and threonine residues, in the middle of the third intracellular loop of α2C10 ablates the rapid component of agonist-promoted desensitization and receptor phosphorylation(15Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the sites for βARKmediated phosphorylation are found within this region. Of the nine serine and threonine residues, four serines occur consecutively and are preceded by two glutamic acid residues (EESSSS). Using a series of synthetic peptides in a reconstituted phospholipid vesicle system with purified βARK, Onorato et al.(19Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) showed that βARK preferentially phosphorylates serines preceded by amino-terminal acidic residues, with the most preferred sequence being EXS. Consequently, we considered that these aforementioned four consecutive serines (Ser-296-299) might serve as sites for βARK-mediated phosphorylation of α2C10. To explore this possibility, six mutant α2C10 receptors lacking all or some combination of the four serines were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis, recombinantly expressed in clonal cell lines, and assessed for their ability to undergo the processes of agonist-promoted desensitization and βARK-mediated phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs and MutagenesisThe human α2C10 cDNA construct in the mammalian expression vector pBC12BI has been described previously(13Kobilka B.K. Matsui H.M. Kobilka T.S. Yang-Feng T.L. Francke U. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Regan J.W. Science. 1987; 238: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a template for mutagenesis and for subsequent transient and permanent transfection of the mutant and wild type α2C10 cDNA into CHO and COS-7 cells as described below. A mutated α2C10 in which amino acid residues 293-304 (denoted as DEL 293-304) were deleted was constructed using a polymerase chain reaction-based technique as described(15Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to unique BspEI and SacII restriction sites (located at amino acid residues 235-236 and 333-334, respectively) were utilized in combination with two mutagenic primers encoding two new AgeI restriction sites (located at amino acids 292-293 and 303-304, respectively) to allow for polymerase extension of a BspEI/AgeI fragment and an AgeI/SacII fragment. These fragments, when digested and ligated into the α2AR-pBC12BI construct, eliminate the nucleotides encoding amino acids 293-304. For construction of the substitution mutants denoted as AAAA, AASS, SSAA, SAAA, and SSSA, a BglII/KpnI fragment of α2C10 was cloned into the phage vector M13, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method of Kunkel et al.(24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar). Mutated fragments were digested with BspEI and KpnI and ligated back into digested α2C10-pBC12BI. All mutations were verified by dideoxy sequencing. The construct consisting of bovine βARK in pBC12BI was as described by Benovic et al.(6Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1989; 256: 235-240Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar).Transfection and Cell CultureFor transient expression of wild type and mutant α2AR, COS-7 cells in monolayers at ∼30-50% confluence were transfected with 10 μg each of the wild type or mutant α2AR constructs and the βARK construct via the DEAE-dextran method as described(25Cullen B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with this method routinely expressed mutant and wild type α2C10 at levels of 10-12 pmol/mg. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were then used for experiments 48 h following transfection. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For permanent expression of wild type and mutant α2AR, CHO cells in monolayers at ∼30% confluence were cotransfected using a calcium precipitation method (25Cullen B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 3 μg of pSV2neo, which provides for G-418 resistance, and 20-40 μg of wild type or mutant α2AR constructs. Clones were screened for expression of wild type or mutant α2AR using a [3H]yohimbine binding assay as described below. CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 80 μg/ml G-418 (to maintain selection pressure) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For experiments using permanently expressed mutant and wild type α2AR in CHO cells, cells in monolayers at ∼90% confluence were utilized. Multiple clones expressing each receptor were studied.Desensitization Conditions and Membrane PreparationCHO cells expressing wild type or mutant α2AR at 90% confluence in monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fresh Ham's F-12 medium without fetal bovine serum was added. Epinephrine at a final concentration of 100 μM was added, and cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. To prevent oxidation of epinephrine, 100 μM ascorbic acid was added to all flasks, including controls. Incubations were terminated by placing flasks on ice and washing five times with ice-cold PBS. Membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis in ice-cold buffer (5 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and scraping with a rubber policeman, followed by centrifugation at 42,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The crude membrane pellets were then resuspended in the appropriate buffer for use in the assays.Adenylyl Cyclase AssayAdenylyl cyclase activities were determined in the presence of buffer alone (basal activity), 1.0 μM forskolin, or 1.0 μM forskolin with the indicated concentrations of agonist via the method of Salomon et al.(26Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar) as modified(17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes from CHO cells expressing the wild type and mutant α2AR, which had been exposed to either media alone or 100 μM epinephrine for 30 min, were prepared as described above and resuspended in a buffer that provided for a final assay concentration of 25 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM EDTA, and 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Since α2AR expressed in CHO cells can also couple to Gs and result in a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase at high agonist concentrations in the assay(27Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar), cells were pretreated with 20 μg/ml cholera toxin as described (27Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15795-15801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 24 h prior to agonist exposure to ablate Gs coupling. Membranes (20-30 μg) were incubated in the above buffer with 2.7 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 μM GTP, 0.1 mM cAMP, 0.12 mM ATP, 50 μg/ml myokinase, 0.05 mM ascorbic acid, and 1.0 μCi of [α-32P]ATP for 45 min at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.0 ml of an ice-cold solution containing [3H]cAMP (∼100,000 dpm) and excess ATP and cAMP. [32P]cAMP and [3H]cAMP were isolated by sequential chromatography over Dowex and alumina columns, with [3H]cAMP used to quantitate individual column recovery. Dose-response data were analyzed using iterative least squares techniques(29De Lean A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 5-16Google Scholar). Agonist-promoted desensitization of wild type α2C10 expressed in CHO cells under the above conditions typically is manifested by a ∼5-fold increase in the EC50 for epinephrine-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, without a change in the maximal extent of inhibition(17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative overexpression of mutant and wild type α2C10 in the current studies probably accounts for this degree of desensitization as compared to the more robust desensitization reported in lower expressing cells(30Thomas J.M. Hoffman B.B. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1305-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Jones S.B. Leone S.L. Bylund D.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 254: 294-300PubMed Google Scholar).Radioligand Binding AssaysExpression levels of wild type and mutant α2AR were determined using a [3H]yohimbine binding assay. Membranes prepared as described above were incubated with 25 nM [3H]yohimbine in the absence or presence of 10 μM phentolamine, which was used to define nonspecific binding, in a buffer containing 75 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM EDTA for 30 min at 37°C. Specific binding was normalized for protein. Competition studies were performed by incubation of membranes with 6 nM [3H]yohimbine in the presence of 12 concentrations of agonist, ranging from 10 nM to 1 mM, in a 50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgSO4, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM EDTA buffer for 30 min at room temperature in both the absence and presence of 100 μM GTP. Saturation binding studies were carried out by incubation of membranes with various concentrations of [3H]yohimbine ranging from 0.5 to 30 nM, in the absence and presence of 10 μM phentolamine in a 25 mM glycylglycine buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. Determination of agonist-promoted receptor sequestration was carried out using a whole cell [3H]yohimbine binding assay at 4°C exactly as described(17Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For all radioligand binding assays, reactions were terminated by dilution with ice-cold 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, followed by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters.Receptor Phosphorylation StudiesWhole cell phosphorylation assays were carried out using COS-7 cells transiently coexpressing βARK with the wild type or one of the mutated α2C10 receptors. For these studies, cells in monolayers were washed twice with PBS, placed in fresh serum-free medium containing 0.3 Ci/ml 32Pi, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with vehicle or a 10 μM concentration of the α2AR agonist UK-14304 for 15 min. Incubations were terminated by placing flasks on ice and washing five times with ice-cold PBS. Membranes were prepared by scraping with a rubber policeman in an ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 at 4°C, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 10 mM NaF) and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), followed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. Crude membrane pellets were then resuspended in the above lysis buffer, sonicated for 15 s, and then repelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. For solubilization, membrane fractions were resuspended in PBS with 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and the aforementioned phosphatase and protease inhibitors and stirred for 2 h at 4°C. Samples were cleared of unsolubilized material by centrifugation at 40,000 × g. Receptors were purified via immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against α2C10 as described previously(15Liggett S.B. Ostrowski J. Chesnut L.C. Kurose H. Raymond J.R. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized material was first rotated at room temperature with preimmune serum (1:200) and protein A-Sepharose 6MB beads for 1 h, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then rotated at 4°C with α2C10 antiserum (1:200) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 6MB beads overnight. Beads complexed to immunoprecipitated material were washed five times with 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, sonicated for five minutes, centrifuged, and supernatants containing equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to 10% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm-MP for ∼6 h with an intensifying screen at −70°C. Dried gels were also exposed to storage Phosphor screens for 2 h, and incorporated 32Pi was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). To confirm the total lack of agonist-promoted phosphorylation observed for the AAAA mutant expressed in COS-7 cells (see “Results”), a limited number of phosphorylation studies were also carried out in CHO cells using the same methods as described above.Data AnalysisAdenylyl cyclase dose-response data and radioligand binding data from competition and saturation experiments were analyzed by iterative least squares techniques, as described by De Lean et al.(29De Lean A. Hancock A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 5-16Google Scholar). For determination of whether agonist competition data was best fit by a simple model (one-site curve) or more complex model (two-site curve), F-test analysis was used with the assignment of the more complex model when p < 0.05. For adenylyl cyclase studies, data are reported as mean ± standard error of the Rmax (maximal response) and the EC50 for epinephrine-mediated inhibition from the indicated number of individual experiments. Comparisons for all experiments were made by two-tailed t tests, with significance imparted at p < 0.05.Materials[3H]Yohimbine (80 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]ATP (30 Ci/mmol), [3H]cAMP (31 Ci/mmol), and 32Pi (9,000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. Forskolin,(-)-epinephrine, cholera toxin, and protein A-Sepharose 6MB beads were from Sigma. UK-14304 and phentolamine were from Research Biochemicals. The cDNA encoding bovine βARK was a generous gift from Jeffrey L. Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University). Geneticin (G-418) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Ham's F-12 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal calf serum were from JRH Biosciences. All other reagents were obtained from standard commercial sources.RESULTSTo ascertain the role of Ser-296-299 in the agonist-promoted desensitization and βARK-mediated phosphorylation of α2C10, we initially constructed a deletion mutant (denoted as DEL 293-304) lacking 12 amino acids, including the four serines and preceding glutamic acids (Fig. 1). This mutant failed to undergo agonist-promoted desensitization (see below), and so we focused our efforts on the four serines within this region with five additional mutants having direct substitution of the potentially phosphorylated serines (Ser-296, 297, 298, and 299). For one of these substitution mutants, all four serines in this region were replaced by alanine residues (denoted as receptor AAAA). Two other mutants had two consecutive serines of the four serines replaced by alanine residues (denoted as receptors AASS and SSAA) (Fig. 1). Mutant and wild type α2C10 were transfected into CHO cells, and clones stably expressing receptors at 3100 ± 200 fmol/mg were utilized for pharmacological characterization and agonist-promoted desensitization studies.Prior to functional studies, the pharmacological characteristics of the mutant and wild type α2C10 were assessed. As summarized in Table 1, all receptors bound [3H]yohimbine with high affinity and displayed the ability to form the agonist-receptor-G-protein high affinity complex in [3H]yohimbine competition studies with epinephrine, with ∼60-70% of the receptors occupying the high affinity state. Both high and low affinity binding constants of the mutant receptors for epinephrine were similar to those of the wild type α2C10, such that similar occupancy would be observed during epinephrine exposure of 100 μM (Table 1). This high affinity binding was sensitive to guanine nucleotide, as curves for both mutant and wild type receptors were monophasic and were best fit to one-site models when 100 μM GTP was included in the assay (Table 1). In addition (see below), the mutated α2ARs functionally coupled to Gi as determined in adenylyl cyclase assays.Tabled 1For studies of agonist-promoted desensitization, wild type α2C10 (α2C10), the deletion mutant (DEL 293-304), and the substitution mutants (AAAA, AASS, and SSAA) were exposed to 100 μM epinephrine for 30 min, and the effects of agonist pretreatment on α2AR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity were assessed in the membranes. As shown in Fig. 2, wild type α2C10-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity underwent desensitization following a 30-min exposure to agonist. This desensitization was manifested as a ∼5-fold increase in the EC50 for epinephrine-mediated inhibition (0.26 ± 0.03 μMversus 1.25 ± 0.12 μM, p < 0.002, Table 2) with no change in the maximal inhibition (44 ± 2% versus 48 ± 2% decrease in forskolin-stimulated cyclase activity, p = NS, Table 2). In contrast, all of the mutant receptors failed to undergo agonist-promoted desensitization, with no significant change in the EC50 or maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 2 and Table 2).Figure 2:Effects of substitution or deletion of Ser 296-299 on agonist-promoted desensitization of α2C10. CHO cells expressing wild type α2C10 (WT α2C10) and the mutants DEL 293-304, AAAA, AASS, and SSAA were exposed to 100 μM epinephrine for 30 min, membranes prepared, and adenylyl"

Release of internal Ca2+ was induced by ATP, via a receptor identified pharmacologically as a P2U type. In single cells, low concentrations of ATP evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. These events were blocked by the putative phospholipase C inhibitor, U-73122 (but not by the inactive analog U-73343) and by the ATP/ADPase, apyrase. In addition, both these agents reduced the [Ca2+]i of unstimulated cells, especially after stirring, and blocked spontaneously occurring [Ca2+]i oscillations, which suggested an already activated state of the ATP receptor, independent from exogenous stimulations. Moreover, it was found that stirring of the cells was correlated with a steady accumulation of inositol phosphates, also blockable by apyrase, and that [Ca2+]i mobilization could be induced by puffs of saline in single cells. The transition to a Ca2+-free environment also provoked [Ca2+]i oscillations, most likely via the increase in ATP4− concentration. This evidence suggests that endogenous ATP is released from L fibroblasts in response to fluid shear stress, and this results in an autocrine, tonic up-regulation of the phosphoinositide signaling system and an ensuing alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis.

The importance of the inositol phosphate (InsP) 1The abbreviations used are: InsPinositol phosphateInsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate[Ca2+]i and [Ca2+]ifree Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and in the extracellular medium, respectivelyKRHKrebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered salinePPIpolyphosphoinositideLPAlysophosphatidic acid. signaling pathway is well recognized in controlling a wide variety of physiological functions, and it is clear that the level of activation of this pathway acutely regulates the release of free Ca2+ from intracellular storage pools and, perhaps indirectly, the influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane(1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). What is less clear, however, is how such systems can be tonically modulated by a constant low level of receptor activation, and the possibility should be considered that a subtle regulation of this pathway might exist via some sort of autocrine mechanism. One cell type which seems to have evolved this kind of mechanism is the endothelial cells of the vasculature. The fluid shear stress of blood flow appears to dynamically regulate the polyphosphoinositide (PPI) metabolism in these cells, and changes in flow rate can alter this balance(2Bhagylakshmi A. Berthlaume F. Reich K.M. Frangos J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This, in turn, leads to changes in nitric oxide synthesis and [Ca2+]i(3Palmer R.M.J.

To our knowledge, a response analogous to this has not been previously reported in cell types other than endothelia. However, from our studies of Ca2+ homeostasis in the mouse fibroblast cell line (L, clone 929), we find striking parallels with the fluid shear stress response of endothelial cells. inositol phosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate free Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol and in the extracellular medium, respectively Krebs-Ringer HEPES-buffered saline polyphosphoinositide lysophosphatidic acid. The L cell line has been widely employed for the expression of recombinant cDNA vectors and also in studies of wound contraction in skin (see (7Niewiarowski S. Goldstein S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1973; 82: 605-610PubMed Google Scholar). It is perhaps in the wound response that the similarity between fibroblasts and endothelial cells is most clearly seen, since both cell types can migrate and generate force via the action of actin and myosin fibrils(8Kolodney M.S. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This contractile response can produce important adverse effects in both tissues: scarring of the skin and permeability of the vascular lining(9Majno G. Palade G.E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 11: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to understand the signaling mechanisms at work in these cells. From in vitro experiments on endothelial cells, it is becoming clear that an increase in fluid shear stress has several direct effects, including a rapid release of ATP and other transmitters, a transient stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and rise in [Ca2+]i and cytoskelatl rearrangement(2Bhagylakshmi A. Berthlaume F. Reich K.M. Frangos J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Milner P. Bodin P. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1991; 179: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that increases in vortical stirring of fibroblast cell suspensions correlated with increases in phospholipid metabolism and in resting [Ca2+]i. The involvement of extracellular ATP in mediating these changes was inferred from the observation that the responses were blocked by the addition of a purified ATP/ADPase, or by the phospholipase C inhibitor, U-73122(12Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar). Responses to fluid shear stress and endogenous, extracellular ATP were also found in individual, adherent cells using fura-2 [Ca2+]i imaging. In these experiments, [Ca2+]i oscillations were induced by short bursts of saline perfusion, which were dependent on extracellular ATP. Thus, we provide evidence for a tonic stimulation of PPI metabolism in L cells which is sustained by extracellular ATP, apparently acting via a P2U type receptor. We propose that, in a fashion similar to that of vascular endothelial cells, ATP is released from the fibroblasts in response to fluid shear stress, and this results in a tonic up-regulation of the InsP signaling system and an alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis. Fura-2 and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. U-73122 (1-[6-[[17β-3-methoxyestra-1-3-5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) from Biomol Research Laboratories, was also prepared as a 2 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. Apyrase (EC 3.6.1.5) grade III and all additional chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Mouse L cells (ATCC CCL 1, clone 929, a kind gift from Dr A. Mantovani, Mario Negri Inst. of Pharmacology, Milan) were plated on either 10-cm plastic dishes or 24-mm glass coverslips and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio-Whittaker), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and antibiotics, in an incubator at 37°C with a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were detached from Petri dishes using a trypsin/EDTA solution, then mixed with a Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's buffered salt solution, 0.1% albumin, centrifuged and resuspended in a Hepes-buffered, Krebs-Ringer saline (KRH) (mmol/liter): 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1.2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 6 glucose, 25 Hepes (pH 7.4). They were then loaded with 2 μM fura-2/AM (acetoxymethylester form) and pluronic acid (0.025%) for 45 min at 24°C, centrifuged, and resuspended in KRH containing 250 μM sulfinpyrazone (to block dye extrusion). Cells were stored at room temperature, at a density of 2 × 106/ml until use. For each experiment, cells were diluted 1:2 with KRH and transferred to a quartz cuvette of either 1.5- or 3-ml volume (volume of cell suspension 0.75 or 1.5 ml, respectively). Fluorescence measurements were made, at 37°C, using LS-50 fluorimeters (Perkin-Elmer), mostly in single-wavelength mode for increased speed. Traces were calibrated at the end of the experiment with membrane permeabilization and EGTA and Ca2+. Data was transferred to a spreadsheet program for off-line analysis and plotting. Cells attached to glass coverslips were fura-2-loaded as above, rinsed, and then mounted on a thermostatted microscope stage (37°C, PDMI-2, Medical Systems Corp.) in 1 ml of KRH. The digital fluorescence imaging system used a Zeiss Axiovert 135 TV microscope connected to a dual monochromator light source (Jasco CAM-230, emitting at 340 and 380 nm) in epifluorescent mode. Fluorescent images (510 nm, 1 pair at each excitation wavelength every 2 s) were collected by an intensified CCD camera (Photonic Science), digitized and integrated in real time (Imaging Technology), and stored on magnetic media. Ratio images and mean ratio values in discrete areas were computed off-line. Stimulation of perfused cultures was achieved by changing the reservoir connected to the peristaltic pump (delay time, 30 s). For experiments which used a static bath, additions were made by removing 0.5 ml of KRH from the cell chamber and replacing it with prewarmed KRH containing the test solution at 2× concentration. For additional details, see Grohovaz et al.(13Grohovaz F. Zacchetti D. Clementi E. Lorenzon P. Meldolesi J. Fumagalli G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures were labeled for 24 h with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/ml) in a medium consisting of 28% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 61.5% Hank's buffered salt solution, 0.5% fetal bovine serum. They were then rinsed twice with Hank's buffered salt solution, detached with trypsin/EDTA, and resuspended in KRH (1 × 106 cells/ml). Ten min before agonist addition, LiCl (10 mM) was added to inhibit the hydrolysis of inositol 1-phosphate. After stimulation, aliquots were removed at the appropriate times and added to trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) to stop the reaction. Following extraction with ether (5 times), the samples were neutralized and the inositol phosphates were separated on Dowex 1-X8 (Fluka) columns. Inositol 1-phosphate (InsP), inositol 1,4-phosphate, and InsP3 were eluted with 10 ml of 0.2, 0.45, and 1.0 M ammonium formate, all in 0.1 M formic acid, respectively. It is likely that the InsP3 fraction also contained some fraction of the inositol tetrakisphosphate content, although this was not determined. Populations of fura-2-loaded L cells, in a fluorimeter with constant stirring, exhibited an average resting [Ca2+]i of 110 ± 28.7 nM (± S.E. of mean). This value, however, was only attained after 1-2 min in the cuvette since immediately following transferral of the cells [Ca2+]i was consistently higher (200-250 nM, data not shown). This change in resting [Ca2+]i appeared not to be due to a change in temperature, but it could be avoided with an extremely gentle transferral procedure. The putative inhibitor of phospholipase C, U-73122 (2-5 μM)(12Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), was also found to block the initial rise (not shown). Once stabilized, the populations responded to 100 μM ATP with a swift elevation of [Ca2+]i (peak 320 ± 23 nM S.E. of mean), which then subsided gradually to prestimulus values (Fig. 1A). Unlike the InsP3-mediated [Ca2+]i transients in other cell types, there was no plateau following the initial spike, although in some cases there was a small and gradual increase in [Ca2+]i 2-3 min after stimulation. The response to ATP was dose-dependent from 0.1 to 100 μM (Fig. 1A). Above 100 μM, the peak of Ca2+ release was progressively reduced. There appeared to be no contribution from external Ca2+ to the ATP-induced rise, since the response looked unchanged in Ca2+-free (1 mM Ca2+, 2 mM EGTA) KRH (not shown). L cells also responded to UTP and ADP with a release of stored Ca2+, but we observed no response to adenosine. The Ca2+ transient evoked by UTP was almost identical with that of ATP, and the two nucleotides were equipotent (Fig. 1, B and D). ADP, on the other hand, was a substantially weaker agonist (Fig. 1, C and D). The response to UTP or ADP was prevented by prior stimulation of the cells with the maximally effective concentration of ATP (100 μM). This was true both in the presence and absence of [Ca2+]o (results not shown), but only in experiments where the first stimulus was not rinsed out. A similar result was obtained if a maximally effective concentration of UTP (100 μM) was applied before ATP or ADP. This was not due to depletion of Ca2+ stores because subsequent application of either thapsigargin (1 μM, a blocker of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases that pump Ca2+ into the store lumen) or of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 1 nM, an agonist which is known to induce GTP-dependent PPI hydrolysis and intracellular Ca2+ release in a variety of cells (14Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) including fibroblasts(15Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12232-12239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) induced an appreciable [Ca2+]i spike (not shown). Submaximal concentrations of the primary nucleotides, however, did permit a second stimulation, a feature common to the quantal release properties of stored Ca2+ by agonists which liberate InsP3(16Muallem S. Pandol S.J. Beeker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 205-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that a single receptor might mediate the Ca2+ release by the nucleotides and that it could be of the P2U subtype(17Watson S. Girdlestone D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 38Google Scholar). Further aspects of the [Ca2+]i responses were revealed when adherent, fura-2-loaded, L cells were examined with the video imaging system. Under resting conditions, the majority of cells were apparently silent, but a few cells showed occasional [Ca2+]i spikes. When the coverslip was perfused with 1 μM ATP (Fig. 2), about 50% of the population responded with a Ca2+ transient and, in about half of those, repetitive spikes or sinusoidal oscillations in [Ca2+]i were observed. Higher concentrations of ATP elicited a response from more cells, but oscillatory behavior was less common. The [Ca2+]i transients did not appear to spread from one cell to the next, and responsive cells did not look morphologically different from unresponsive ones. Oscillatory activity was gradually blocked by the addition of 0.5 mM excess EGTA; cells showed two or three spikes before stopping. The dihydropyridine blocker of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, nitrendipine, had no effect on the oscillations, but, in contrast, an immediate cessation was produced by the addition of U-73122 (2 μM) to the perfusate. When U-73122 was rinsed out, the oscillations would recommence. A characteristic behavior of these cells was a transient increase in [Ca2+]i in the form of a “hump,” which occurred after the addition of EGTA to L cell suspensions. Fig. 3A shows an example of this hump, immediately after the EGTA-induced fluorescence drop (due to extracellular fura-2). We found that this slow transient could not be reproduced when EGTA was administered to cells suspended in Ca2+-free KRH or when the cells in complete KRH were subjected to a small drop in pH, as might occur upon EGTA addition (data not shown). We then considered that it might arise from the conversion of endogenous CaATP to the ATP4- form, known to be more efficacious at the P2U receptors(17Watson S. Girdlestone D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 38Google Scholar) . This was tested by using a naturally occurring ATPase, apyrase, which rapidly hydrolyzes both ATP and ADP. At concentrations between 0.2 and 1.0 unit per ml (2-10 μg of protein), this purified protein eliminated the EGTA-induced hump (Fig. 3B), but did not significantly affect the response to LPA (Fig. 3D). It can also be seen from Fig. 3B that a drop in [Ca2+]i of around 20-30 nM occurred following apyrase addition. These results suggest that there is some occupancy of ATP receptors in the presence of “normal” [Ca2+]i (2 mM), and this produces some tonic stimulation of InsP3 production and Ca2+ release. The addition of U-73122 (2-5 μM) also produced a drop in resting [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3C) of the same magnitude as that of apyrase. When U-73122 and apyrase were administered sequentially, the induced drop in [Ca2+]i was found not to be additive (Fig. 3C), suggesting that a common pathway was affected by the two agents. U-73122 also eliminated the EGTA-induced hump and prevented the initial elevation in [Ca2+]i which occurred during transferral of the cells to the cuvette (not shown), indicating that these three phenomena were causally related. In contrast, the inactive analog of U-73122, U-73343(12Bleasdale J.E. Thakur N.R. Gremban R.S. Bundy G.L. Fitzpatrick F.A. Smith R.J. Bunting S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 756-768PubMed Google Scholar), used at 2-5 μM, had no effect on resting [Ca2+]i, the EGTA-induced hump, or the initial rise. None of the compounds tested, apyrase, U-73122, or U-73343, was found to have any intrinsic fluorescence at the settings used, nor did they show any quenching of fura-2 fluorescence. These data therefore suggest that “resting” L cells are maintained at a plateau level of Ca2+ mobilization and that this is caused by endogenous ATP activating the cell surface receptors. Similar phenomena could be observed in single attached cells in a static bath, i.e. one without continuous perfusion. Both single and repeated [Ca2+]i transients could be initiated in individual cells simply by the addition of EGTA (Fig. 4). In 75% of cells of such experiments, the response to EGTA was a brief spike and, for half of those, the spikes were repetitive. The remaining 25% of cells exhibited longer lasting transients or complex spikes. These “spontaneous” spikes were of a peak height similar to an ATP-induced transient, as can be seen when 100 μM ATP was added at the end of a series of spontaneous spikes (Fig. 4). When apyrase (0.5 unit/ml) was included in the extracellular saline (Fig. 4), we found that some random spikes remained, but the EGTA-induced spikes and oscillations were absent. In some cells, bathed in Ca2+-containing KRH, a single [Ca2+]i spike could apparently be provoked by a puff of saline alone, following a lag time of about 3 s. To produce these saline puffs, saline was drawn up and re-expelled from a tube at a short distance from the imaged cells; thus, the cells within the microscope field received saline which had washed over neighboring cells. The [Ca2+]i spikes induced in this manner were usually not repetitive, but were otherwise similar in form to the EGTA-induced spikes. They were blocked by U-73122 (2 μM, not shown). Further confirmation that ATP exerted a tonic activation of receptors was obtained by examination of InsP accumulation under conditions where inositol-1-phosphatase was blocked by Li+. Fig. 5A shows that, for L cells analyzed in a stirred suspension, addition of exogenous ATP (100 μM) induced a steady accumulation of InsPs (+100%) for the 10 min of the experiment. A more moderate but clear steady increase was observed also in the unstimulated control cells. Only when 0.5 unit/ml apyrase was included in the KRH was this rise prevented, indicating that PPI hydrolysis had virtually stopped (Fig. 5A). A similar result was obtained if U-73122 (2 μM), but not U-73343, was used instead of apyrase (data not shown). Also examined was the profile of InsP3 formation under the same conditions (in the presence and absence of Li+). Fig. 5B shows that the stirring of the unstimulated cell suspension caused [InsP3] to rise, although moderately and slowly, and that this could be suppressed with apyrase. When stimulated with 100 μM ATP, InsP3 formation was stimulated over a period of 2 min and then was maintained at an elevated plateau. For comparison, we also tested the effect of LPA; stimulation by LPA dramatically increased levels of InsP3 within the first 30 s and following that subsided to prestimulus levels (Fig. 5B). In this investigation we show that mouse L cells respond to applied ATP with increased PPI turnover and Ca2+ release. As a plated monolayer, the cells frequently responded to exogenous ATP with a series of [Ca2+]i spikes. Our evidence suggests that the experimental manipulation of these cells also leads to their stimulation in an autocrine fashion. This, we suggest, is due to the release of ATP in response to fluid shear stress. The ATP receptor expressed by mouse L cells, as evidenced by pharmacological results, appeared to be of the P2U subtype (recently redefined as P2Y2, (18Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). This receptor displays equal sensitivity to ATP and UTP and a low sensitivity for ADP(14Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It also shows a relatively greater sensitivity for ATP4− ions(17Watson S. Girdlestone D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 38Google Scholar), confirmed in the present study. A receptor with a similar agonist specificity appears to be expressed by variety of cells, including fibroblasts (19Fine J. Cole P. Davidson J.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Fischer G.A. Clementi E. Raichman M. Südhof T. Ullrich A. Meldolesi J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Murrin R.J.A. Boarder M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 561-568PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lin T.A. Lustig K.D. Sportiello M.G. Weisman G.A. Sun G.Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1115-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The P2Y receptor, on the other hand, which is expressed by endothelial cells(24Boeynaems J.-M. Pearson J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 34-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), has a sensitivity ATP = ADP > UTP, and so is clearly different. The ATP receptor of L cells appeared to be a relatively weak stimulator of phospholipase C, because when compared to the InsP3-liberating action of LPA, the release of InsP3 by ATP was small and slow. This could be due to partial, homologous desensitization of a type which seems frequent in phospholipase C-coupled receptors(25Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We also noted that ATP was never able to deplete Ca2+ stores (in single cells or suspension), whereas LPA was able to, thus precluding any further release by the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase blocker, thapsigargin. The fact that fluid shear stress can induce the release of ATP, prostacyclin, and other vasoactive substances from endothelial cells is relatively known(5Korenaga R. Ando J. Tsuboi H. Yang W. Sakuma I. Toyo-oka T. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Milner P. Bodin P. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and, in vivo, this process is thought to mediate the vasodilation which occurs when blood flow increases(3Palmer R.M.J. Ferrige A.G. Moncada S. Nature. 1987; 327: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (9343) Google Scholar, 6Rubanyi G.M. Romero J.C. Vanhoutte P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: H1145-H1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling pathway involved and the mechanism of transmitter release, however, is less. In single cells, shear stress produces a transient rise in [Ca2+]i, and the peak amplitude is proportional to the applied shear(4Shen J. Luscinskas F.W. Connolly A. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Am J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C384-C390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Milner P. Bodin P. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Intracellular [Ca2+]i oscillations can occur, and PPI metabolism, as well as several other lipid pathways, is also stimulated (2Bhagylakshmi A. Berthlaume F. Reich K.M. Frangos J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Shen J. Luscinskas F.W. Connolly A. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Am J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C384-C390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The responses of mouse L cells, observed in the present study to the physical stress of saline movement, appeared similar to the shear stress-response of endothelial cells, although differences were also apparent. Agitation of the cells by either transferral or stirring was associated with an increase in [Ca2+]i, but, since this could be rapidly reduced with U-73122, or apyrase, it suggests that it was an elevated plateau. Vortical stirring also resulted in an increase in InsP3 production which was similarly and dramatically reduced by the addition of apyrase. These data point toward a shear-induced stimulation of PPI metabolism leading to an enhanced discharge of intracellular Ca2+ pools. The similarity of the effect of apyrase addition to that of putative phospholipase C inhibitor, U-73122, in reducing [Ca2+]i and PPI metabolism implicated the involvement of extracellular ATP in setting the resting [Ca2+]i. The existence of tangible levels of ATP in the extracellular milieu was also suggested by the induction of small [Ca2+]i transients by EGTA addition. The chelation of Ca2+ by EGTA could lead to a 2-fold increase in the effective ATP4− concentration(26Greenberg S. Di Virgilio F. Steinberg S.H. Silverstein S. J. Biol.

Apyrase was found to eliminate this EGTA-induced hump and yet had no effect on [Ca2+]i mobilization provoked by LPA. The ATPase also inhibited repetitive [Ca2+]i spikes induced by EGTA in plated cells. Thus, we believe that ATP, released into the medium by L cells experiencing fluid shear stress, is responsible for the activation of PPI metabolism and [Ca2+]i release. The oscillations in membrane potential previously observed in multinucleate L cell giants (27Okada Y. Tsuchiya W. Yada T. J. Physiol. 1982; 327: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28Oiki S. Okada Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) appear unrelated to [Ca2+]i oscillations, since only the first were inhibitable by dehydropyridine antagonists of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, spontaneously occurring cell giants (n = 2) were found to have very small [Ca2+]i oscillations. This, and the finding that oscillations could continue for a short time in a Ca2+-free saline, suggests that it is the kinetics of discharging and recharging the internal Ca2+ pools which most likely create the oscillatory behavior(29Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, endothelial cells do not show Ca2+ oscillations when exposed to low concentrations of ATP, but do in response to histamine(30Jacob R. Merritt J.E. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1988; 335: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the lack of effect of ATP is due to the high level of ectonucleotidase activity associated with these cells (24Boeynaems J.-M. Pearson J.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 34-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 31O'Connor S.E. Dainty I.A. Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 137-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) or that the response is intrinsic to the ATP receptor subtype. It is perhaps significant that, in endothelial cells, 1-10 μM ATP produced a [Ca2+]i transient 3-5-fold higher than that of stress-induced response(10Milner P. Bodin P. Loesch A. Burnstock G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas in L cells exogenous ATP (10-100 μM) produced a Ca2+ transient of a similar height, but broader than a spontaneous spike. We found that L cells exhibited a variety of oscillatory forms; from repetitive Ca2+ spikes with no elevated baseline to cells which showed sinusoidal [Ca2+]i oscillations on an elevated baseline. The continuum of forms of oscillations exhibited by these cell indicates that the mechanism for each must be fundamentally the same. To speculate on a possible role that tonic ATP stimulation and induction of [Ca2+]i oscillation might play in the living animal, we might suggest that these events are important during fibroblast migration. It is well known that, after cutaneous wounding, quiescent fibroblasts become activated and migrate to the fibronectin-fibrin wound interface(32Hebda P.A. Collins M.A. Tharp M.D. Dermatol. Clin. 1993; 11: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that [Ca2+]i oscillations occur during the migration of both fibroblasts and endothelial cells(33Osipchuk Y.V. Cahalan M. Nature. 1992; 359: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The oscillations and thus, perhaps, cell movement, could be modulated by autocrine release of low concentrations of ATP. It has been reported recently that mast cells also migrate into the wound area and establish a special relationship with the activated fibroblasts(34Hahn K. DeBiasio R. Taylor D.L. Nature. 1992; 359: 736-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mast cells release ATP upon antigen binding, and this spreads the activation response from cell to cell. It is thus likely that fibroblasts in the wound site would also be party to this flow of information. We have demonstrated that L fibroblasts express a P2U-subtype ATP receptor, a relatively weak stimulator of PPI metabolism, which, however, can elicit [Ca2+]i oscillations. In addition, this receptor appears to play a key role in the change of Ca2+ homeostasis induced in fibroblast cells by fluid shear stress, a response that appears to be sustained by the autocrine release of ATP. We advise, therefore, that particular care be employed when using mouse L cells in models of signaling in view of their sensitivity to handling. Clearly, many aspects of the above processes remain to be investigated, including the nature of the shear stress receptor and the mechanism(s) of ATP secretion. Further studies should also address fibroblasts from various origins, since it is clear from the endothelial cells (2Bhagylakshmi A. Berthlaume F. Reich K.M. Frangos J.A. J. Vasc. Res. 1992; 29: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that origin has a profound effect on physiological response."

In this report, we extend our earlier studies of HMG-I/Y binding to naked A•T-rich DNA and to chicken mononucleosomes to include the effect of protein binding on the topological state of closed circular DNA. Topoisomerase I-mediated relaxation assays of complexes of HMG-I/Y with supercoiled plasmid DNA reveal that HMG-I/Y induces positive supercoiling at low protein to nucleotide molar ratios in a manner similar to netropsin, suggesting that bends are induced in the substrate at these protein concentrations. At higher ratios, however, negative supercoils are induced, indicating that protein binding leads to underwinding of DNA at these concentrations, in contrast to the positive supercoils induced by binding of netropsin. Additionally, we present footprinting evidence that HMG-I/Y is capable of binding to and altering the secondary structure of non-B-form DNA. Recombinant human HMG-I and HMG-Y were produced using the expression vector pET7C and were purified by ion exchange chromatography as described previously (32Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using e220 = 74,000 and e220 = 68,000 liters/mol•cm for HMG-I and HMG-Y, respectively(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional HMG-I protein, ΔE91, was also prepared using the same methods. This protein lacks the 17 glutamic acid-rich residues at the carboxyl terminus of the intact HMG-I molecule, and its construction has been detailed previously(33Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21137-21146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of plasmid pBLT, which contains the 300-base pair A•T-rich 3′-untranslated region derived from the bovine interleukin-2 cDNA, has been described(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pUC-18 and pBLT were purified by banding on CsCl gradients, and concentrations were determined by absorption at 260 nm. Washed, packed, and frozen chicken erythrocytes were purchased as 10-ml aliquots from Lampire Biological, Pipersville, PA. Cells were simultaneously thawed and lysed in ice-cold 10 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the nuclear pellet was washed by resuspension in buffer without Nonidet P-40 and subsequent centrifugation. Topoisomerase I was then isolated from washed nuclei, employing the procedure detailed by Pfaffle and Jackson (34Pfaffle P. Jackson V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16821-16829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing topoisomerase activity were pooled and split into aliquots. These aliquots were stored frozen at −70°C. Enzyme activity was assayed using pUC18, where one unit will relax 0.5 μg of supercoiled DNA in 0.5 h at 37°C. For a typical assay, either HMG-I or HMG-Y protein, ethidium bromide (EtBr) or netropsin was added in varying ratios to 2 μg of negatively supercoiled pBLT or pUC18 plasmid, and incubated at 23°C for 30 min in 200 μl of 20 mM Tris•Cl, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Twenty units of topoisomerase I were added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Samples were then made 0.1% in SDS and digested with 0.1 mg/ml Proteinase K for 30 min at 37°C followed by extensive extraction with phenol/CHCl3 and ethanol precipitation of the DNA. The DNA was redissolved in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mM EDTA) and electrophoresed overnight on 1.5% agarose-TAE gels at 0.5 V/cm and 23°C. The gels were stained with EtBr and photographed. Aliquots of topoisomerase-relaxed DNA prepared for one-dimensional analysis were loaded onto 1.5% agarose-TAE (40 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 20 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM EDTA) gels and electrophoresed for 3 h at 6 V/cm and 23°C. The gels were then stained for 1 h in TAE containing 1.5 μg/ml chloroquine phosphate, rotated 90° with respect to the original direction of migration, and the electrophoresis was repeated in TAE supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml chloroquine phosphate. The gels were stained with EtBr and photographed. Dissociation constants of HMG-I and HMG-I(ΔE91) to supercoiled plasmids were determined using a fluorescence competition assay employing the dye Hoechst 33258 as reported previously(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Suzuki M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For these assays, plasmid concentration was fixed at 0.33 μg/ml, protein concentration was 10 nM, and dye concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 nM. Footprinting of supercoiled DNA with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) was largely as described by McLean(36Mclean M.J. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1994: 89-95Google Scholar). Various amounts of HMG-I(ΔE91) were mixed with 1 μg of supercoiled pBLT in 45 μl of TE. Following a 30-min incubation at 23°C, 5 μl of DEPC was added, and incubation continued for an additional 15 min. The samples were then precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol and redissolved in water. After addition of the appropriate buffer, the DNA was digested with EcoRI, and the ends were labeled by standard methods (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloaning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow polymerase. The labeled 300-base pair fragment was then released from the vector by digestion with SalI, isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified from the agarose with Geneclean (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). The purified DNA was finally cleaved by treatment with 10% piperidine for 15 min at 90°C and the cleavage products were visualized by autoradiography following electrophoresis on a 6% sequencing gel. Autoradiographs were scanned with an LKB Ultroscan XL laser densitometer. The effect of various DNA binding ligands on the superhelicity of two plasmid substrates was investigated by agarose gel electrophoresis. In these experiments, ligand-DNA complexes were treated with topoisomerase I to relax the superhelical stress in the DNA followed by removal of the ligand and subsequent electrophoretic resolution of the resulting topoisomers. Topoisomerase I removes any superhelical stress that is not constrained by ligand-DNA interactions. Consequently, the topoisomers resolved following removal of the ligand reflect changes in DNA secondary and tertiary structure due to interaction with the ligand. Plasmid pBLT was chosen as a test DNA substrate because it contains a 300-base pair A•T-rich insert whose interaction with HMG-I/Y has been previously characterized(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Reeves R. Elton T.S. Nissen M.S. Lehn D. Johnson K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6531-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The A•T-rich insert was derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the bovine interleukin-2 cDNA and has an A•T base content of 71.4 mol % discounting the poly(A) tail. Plasmid pUC18 was used for sake of comparison since pBLT was derived from it. Fig. 1 shows the one-dimensional electrophoretic results typical for a topoisomerase assay. Lane1 of each panel shows the plasmid relaxed with topoisomerase I in the absence of protein. The relative positions of relaxed and supercoiled plasmid are indicated in the figure. In panelA, the two plasmids were relaxed with topoisomerase in the presence of molar ratios of HMG-I to nucleotide that varied from 0 to 2.2. It should be noted that in these assays, the plasmids are initially supercoiled when HMG-I/Y is bound and that topoisomerase is added subsequently. Consequently, non-B-form DNA conformations, which might be formed as a result of supercoiling, could also serve as recognition sights for protein binding. It can be clearly seen that the presence of increasing amounts of HMG-I protein results in a change in the distribution of the topoisomers formed following relaxation of either plasmid and subsequent removal of the protein. PanelB of the figure shows results of an assay performed with HMG-Y. Comparison of panelsA and B indicates that increasing concentrations of both HMG-I and HMG-Y produce identical distributions of topoisomers in either pBLT or pUC18. Interestingly, HMG-I and HMG-Y produced qualitatively similar distributions of topoisomers in both the A•T-rich pBLT plasmid and its parent vector, pUC18. We interpret this to mean that HMG-I/Y, in addition to its ability to bind A•T-rich sequences and influence the secondary and tertiary structure of the plasmid, may also recognize and bind structures induced in substrate DNA as a result of supercoiling. It should also be noted that the distribution of isomers over the course of the titration is different for the two plasmids, suggesting that the A•T-rich insert of supercoiled pBLT may have some intrinsic structure or that HMG-I/Y interacts differently with it. The same experiment was carried out using the A•T-binding antibiotic netropsin as the DNA binding ligand. Netropsin was chosen for two reasons. First, it has been suggested that the DNA binding domain of HMG-I may mimic the structure of netropsin (8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lund T. Dahl H.D. Mork E. Holtlund J. Laland S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that the two molecules may interact with DNA in a similar fashion. Second, it has also been demonstrated that netropsin introduces positive supercoils into DNA when subjected to the sort of assay employed here(40Snounou G. Malcolm A.D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Storl K. Storl J. Zimmer C. Lown J.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, relaxation of the plasmid in the presence of netropsin followed by removal of the antibiotic results in changes in the superhelical density of the DNA that are qualitatively similar to those produced by HMG-I/Y. In order to help determine the sign of the supercoils introduced by HMG-I/Y, topological “standards” were prepared by topoisomerase-mediated relaxation of plasmid DNA in the presence of the intercalating dye EtBr. The binding of EtBr to DNA has been extensively characterized, and it is well known that intercalation of EtBr causes unwinding of the helix(42Pulleyblank D.E. Morgan A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 783-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). It is also known that relaxation of circular DNA in the presence of EtBr followed by removal of the dye results in negatively supercoiled DNA; an effect opposite of that produced by netropsin(40Snounou G. Malcolm A.D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 1D demonstrates the results of relaxation of pBLT and pUC18 in the presence of increasing concentrations of EtBr. Aliquots of the samples shown in Fig. 1 were electrophoresed on two-dimensional agarose gels in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml of chloroquine in the second dimension. Chloroquine intercalates into DNA and, under the conditions employed here, will retard the migration of negatively supercoiled DNA while it increases the migration of relaxed and positively supercoiled DNA(44Shure M. Pulleyblank D.E. Vinograd J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1183-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This effect is seen in Fig. 2. In the figure, negatively supercoiled topoisomers tend to the left of the figure (the origin of the second dimension), while positively supercoiled topoisomers tend to the right (the direction of migration in the second dimension). Fig. 2, A and B, shows two-dimensional gels of pBLT and pUC18 relaxed in the presence of HMG-I and HMG-Y, respectively. In both cases, it is seen that with increasing protein concentration, the plasmids initially become positively supercoiled, that is, the migration rate of the topoisomers increases. However, as the protein concentration increases, the plasmids become negatively supercoiled as demonstrated by the reduced mobility of the ensemble of topoisomers. In contrast, pBLT relaxed in the presence of netropsin shows the opposite behavior (Fig. 2C). In this case, migration of the topoisomers is increased, indicating that the DNA is positively supercoiled; an observation in agreement with that reported previously(40Snounou G. Malcolm A.D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Storl K. Storl J. Zimmer C. Lown J.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that pUC18 exhibits both positive and negative supercoils at a netropsin concentration that produces all positive supercoils in pBLT, again suggesting that the ligand interacts differently with the A•T-rich BLT DNA. Fig. 2D shows the effect of EtBr on the distribution of topoisomers. It is evident that EtBr induces formation of negative supercoils in this assay. Overall, the distribution of topoisomers produced at low protein to nucleotide molar ratios resembles that produced by netropsin, while at higher protein to nucleotide molar ratios, the distribution resembles that produced by ethidium. Topoisomerase-mediated relaxation assays were performed using ΔE91, an HMG-I protein that lacks the 17-glutamic acid-rich C-terminal residues found in the full-length protein(33Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21137-21146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results of a typical one-dimensional assay are shown in Fig. 3A. The overall pattern of topoisomers produced by relaxation of DNA in the presence of the truncated protein is similar to that produced by the full-length protein (Fig. 1A). It is important to note, however, that the ΔE91 to nucleotide molar ratios in Fig. 3 are approximately 10-fold less than the HMG-I to nucleotide ratios in Fig. 1. The sign of supercoiling induced by ΔE91 was determined by analysis on two-dimensional chloroquine gels (Fig. 3B), and the sign of the induced supercoils was determined to be positive at relatively low protein to nucleotide molar ratios, with negative supercoils being induced at higher protein to nucleotide molar ratios. We investigated the relative affinity of both HMG-I and ΔE91 for supercoiled DNA using an assay based on the competition of binding of a fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33258, to A•T-rich HMG-I binding sites(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this determination, supercoiled plasmid DNA at a fixed concentration was titrated with Hoechst 33258 in the absence or in the presence, of 10 nM HMG-I or ΔE91 in buffer containing 50 mM NaCl. In Table 1, it is seen that the affinity of Hoechst 33258 for supercoiled DNA is between 13 and 18 nM, in good agreement with a dissociation constant of 9.6 nM previously reported for binding of the dye to linear, A•T-rich DNA(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinities of HMG-I and ΔE91 for supercoiled pUC18 were very similar with values of 35.5 nM and 32.4 nM, respectively. In contrast, the affinity of HMG-I for supercoiled pBLT was determined to be 38.0 nM, and that of ΔE91 was determined to be 26.6 nM, a change in affinity of about 1.4-fold. This suggests that the acidic carboxyl-terminal of HMG-I is capable of modulating, to a relatively small degree, the binding of the protein with supercoiled A•T-rich DNA, while at the same time dramatically changing the ability of the protein to induce both positive and negative supercoils in plasmid DNAs.Tabled 1 The A•T-rich insert of supercoiled pBLT was footprinted with DEPC either as naked DNA or as a complex with ΔE91. Fig. 4 compares the relative cleavage frequency at adenine of supercoiled DNA alone or of supercoiled DNA complexed with ΔE91 (this experiment was not performed on pUC18). It is apparent that certain regions of the A•T-rich pBLT DNA react readily with DEPC, suggesting that the DNA is not in the refractory “normal” B conformation but possesses an altered secondary structure, which renders it more susceptible to reaction with the reagent(36Mclean M.J. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1994: 89-95Google Scholar). It can also be seen that addition of ΔE91 protein causes a dramatic change in the cleavage pattern of the DNA and that this change involves the regions most susceptible to modification by DEPC (Fig. 4, bracketedpeaks). In contrast, A•T-rich regions of the BLT DNA that have been previously identified by footprinting to be HMG-I binding sites(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Reeves R. Elton T.S. Nissen M.S. Lehn D. Johnson K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6531-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) show little or no change in their DEPC footprint (Fig. 4). The data suggest that, in addition to the characterized ability to bind to the minor groove of A•T-rich DNA, HMG-I/Y proteins may also recognize and bind non-B-form DNA and that such binding may, in turn, further alter the conformation of the bound DNA. Earlier work from this laboratory has identified an 11-amino acid peptide, with the consensus sequence TPKRPRGRPKK, as the sequence responsible for the specific interaction of HMG-I/Y with the minor groove of A•T-rich DNA(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The core of the binding domain sequence, PRGRP, has been suggested to have a structure similar to that of the A•T DNA binding drug netropsin(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lund T. Holtlund J. Laland S.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a suggestion that is supported by circular dichroism(46Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Johnson K.R. Reeves R. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 963-971PubMed Google Scholar), molecular modeling(8Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and two-dimensional 1H NMR studies(9Evans J.N.S. Nissen M.S. Reeves R. Bull. Magn. Reson. 1992; 14: 171-174Google Scholar). This notion is further strengthened by the fact that netropsin and the structurally similar drug distamycin bind to DNA sequences that are preferred HMG-I/Y binding sites and will, in fact, compete with the protein for these sites(10Radic M.Z. Saghbini M. Elton T.S. Reeves R. Hamkalo B. Chromosoma. 1992; 101: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 47Wegner M. Grummt F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1110-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Prior studies on the binding of netropsin to negatively supercoiled DNA established that relaxation of the drug-DNA complex by topoisomerase I followed by removal of the drug resulted in the introduction of positive supercoils(40Snounou G. Malcolm A.D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A more recent study compared the effects of minor groove binding drugs including netropsin, distamycin, pentamidine, and others. The investigators concluded that different minor groove binding ligands differ in their ability to induce changes in supercoiling and that these differences are not due to a single binding property of each ligand(48Storl K. Burckhardt G. Lown J.W. Zimmer C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to examine the effect of binding of HMG-I/Y on DNA supercoiling and to compare it to the known effect of netropsin binding. The fundamental relationship between the topological and geometrical properties of closed circular DNA is described by the expression Lk = Tw + Wr wh"

We observed endocytosis in transfected epithelial cells by confocal microscopy using cyanine 3-GRP (cyanine 3.18-labeled gastrin releasing peptide) and GRP-R antibodies. At 4°C, cy3-GRP and GRP-R were confined to the plasma membrane. After 5 min at 37°C, ligand and receptor were internalized into early endosomes with fluorescein isothiocyanate-transferrin. After 10 min, cy3-GRP and GRP-R were in perinuclear vesicles, and at 60 min cy3-GRP was in large, central vesicles, while GRP-R was at the cell surface. We quantified surface GRP-R using an antibody to an extracellular epitope and an 125I-labeled secondary antibody. After exposure to GRP, there was a loss and subsequent recovery of surface GRP-R. Recovery was unaffected by cycloheximide, and thus independent of new protein synthesis, but was attenuated by acidotropic agents, and therefore required endosomal acidification. Internalization of 125I-GRP, assessed using an acid wash, was maximal after 10-20 min, and was clathrin-mediated since it was inhibited by hyperosmolar sucrose and phenylarsine oxide. Thus, GRP and its receptor are rapidly internalized into early endosomes and then dissociate in an acidified compartment. GRP is probably degraded whereas the GRP-R recycles.

Walsh J.H. Dockray G.J. Gut Peptides. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 423-445Google Scholar).

The response of many cells expressing the GRP-R desensitizes and resensitizes after exposure to agonist(7Lee P.C. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. Am. J.

The mechanism of desensitization is unknown, but may include phosphorylation of the receptor with subsequent uncoupling from G proteins and physical removal of the receptor from the plasma membrane by endocytosis(8Pandol S.J. Jensen R.T. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12024-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another neuropeptide, substance P, induces endocytosis and recycling of the neurokinin 1 receptor which coincides with desensitization and resensitization of cellular responses to substance P(10Bowden J.J. Garland A.M. Baluk P. Lefevre P. Grady E.F. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. McDonald D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8964-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 11Garland A.M.

Endocytosis of the thrombin receptor also contributes to desensitization(12Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, endocytosis of the β2-adrenergic receptor is not involved in rapid desensitization, but is required for resensitization(13Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol.

Endocytosis of the GRP-R has usually been studied indirectly by ligand binding experiments using 125I-labeled ligand and an acid wash procedure to distinguish between cell surface and internalized peptide(15Zachary I. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Brown K.D. Laurie M.S. Littlewood C.J. Blakeley D.M. Corps A.N.

However, the intracellular compartment containing GRP and the GRP-R has not been identified, and the mechanism of endocytosis and sorting has not been examined. We directly observed endocytosis of both GRP and the GRP-R in transfected cells using fluorescent GRP and receptor antibodies. The results show that GRP and its receptor are rapidly internalized by a clathrin-dependent mechanism into early endosomes. GRP is sorted from its receptor in an acidified perinuclear compartment; GRP remains in the cell whereas the GRP-R recycles to the plasma membrane.

Cells were plated 24-48 h before experiments on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips (for microscopy or Ca2+ mobilization), on 16-mm plastic wells (for quantification of surface GRP-R), or on 30-mm plastic wells (for 125I-GRP binding experiments). Unless stated otherwise, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (DMEM/BSA) during all experiments. Cells were washed with Hank's buffered salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, loaded with 2.5 μM fura-2/AM for 20 min at 37°C, and washed(21Okamoto A. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured in a fluorimeter (F-2000, Hitachi Instruments, Irvine, CA) at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission. A single injection of GRP-10 or cy3-GRP (10 pM-1 μM) was followed by addition of digitonin (50 μM) to lyse cells, and then EGTA (5 mM). Cells were dissociated using an enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer, adjusted to 106 per tube in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum, washed, and incubated with 100 nM cy3-GRP in 500 μl of DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum for 60 min at 4°C. They were washed, resuspended in 200 μl of the dissociation buffer with 0.3% fetal calf serum and 1.5 μg/ml of propidium iodide, and analyzed using a FACS StarPLUS (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), equipped with dual argon and helium-neon lasers. A minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed per sample. Viability of cells, as determined by exclusion of propidium iodide, exceeded 80%. Cells were incubated with 100 nM cy3-GRP at 4°C, to allow equilibrium binding, and were washed at 4°C. Medium at 37°C was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 0-120 min to allow internalization. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4°C, and mounted in Slow Fade. To examine the specificity of cy3-GRP binding, cells were preincubated with 1 μM unlabeled GRP-10 for 30 min at 4°C, and then incubated with 1 μM unlabeled GRP-10 and 100 nM cy3-GRP for 60 min at 4°C. To examine endocytosis of cy3-GRP in living cells, cells were incubated with cy3-GRP as described, washed, and then incubated at 37 or 18°C on an inverted microscope equipped with a microincubator (PDMI-2, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY). To simultaneously observe endocytosis of GRP and transferrin, cells were incubated with 100 nM cy3-GRP and 17 μM iron-loaded FITC-transferrin (22van Renswoude J. Bridges K.R. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) at 4°C, warmed to 37°C for 0-10 min, and fixed as described. To localize the internalized receptor, cells were incubated with 10-100 nM GRP-10 at 4°C, washed, and incubated at 37°C for 0-120 min. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and incubated in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin for 3 periods of 5 min. All subsequent washes and antibody dilutions used this buffer. Cells were incubated with the GRP-R antiserum #9432 (1:50 for 4 h at 37°C or 1:500 overnight at 4°C), washed, incubated with a FITC- or rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 for 2 h at room temperature), washed, and mounted. Fixed cells were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope, equipped with fluorescein (Zeiss 487910, excitation 450-490 nm, emission 515-565 nm, chromatic beam splitter 510 nm) and rhodamine (Zeiss 487915, excitation 546 nm, emission>590 nm, chromatic beam splitter 580 nm) filters. Endocytosis in living cells was observed using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter. Images were either captured using a cooled CCD color video camera system (ZVS-47EC, Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA) directly to a Macintosh Centris 650 computer using a ColorSnap 32+ video capture board (Computer Friends Inc., Portland, OR) (image size 640 × 480 pixels) or obtained using a Zeiss MC100 camera and Ektachrome EPH p1600 film, and transferred to Photo CD (Kodak). For confocal microscopy, we used a Zeiss Laser Scan Inverted 410 microscope with an argon-krypton laser with fluorescein (line selection 485/20 nm, main dichroic 510 nm, emission LP 515 nm) and rhodamine (line selection 530-585 nm, main dichroic 580 nm, emission LP 568 nm) filters, yielding images that were 512 × 512 pixels. All images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 2.5 (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA) on a Macintosh Centris 650 computer, and photographed using an Image Corder slide maker (Focus Graphics, Foster City, CA). Cells were washed with binding buffer (1:1 DMEM and Weymouth's medium MB 752/1 plus 8.2 g/liter BES, containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% bacitracin, pH 7.4), and incubated with 125I-GRP (400,000 cpm) and 0.039-10 nM unlabeled GRP-27 in 1 ml of binding buffer for 60 min at 4°C, to allow binding to reach equilibrium(19Slice L.W. Wong H.C. Sternini C. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Walsh J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21755-21761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, lysed in 2% Na2HCO3, 1% SDS, and 0.1 M NaOH for 10 min at 37°C and counted. Specific counts were obtained by subtraction of nonspecific binding (cells pretreated with 1 μM GRP-27 prior to incubation with 125I-GRP). Results were expressed as femtomole of 125I-GRP bound per 106 cells and kd and Bmax were determined by Scatchard analysis. To quantify internalized peptide, cells were incubated with 400,000 cpm of 125I-GRP and 2 nM unlabeled GRP-27 for 60 min at 4°C, and washed 3 times at 4°C. Warm medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37°C for 0-60 min, and washed 3 times with ice-cold buffer. To separate cell-surface (acid-sensitive) from internalized (acid-resistant) 125I-GRP, cells were incubated in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.2 M acetic acid, 500 mM NaCl (pH 2.5) for 5 min, lysed, and the acid-sensitive and acid-resistant pools were counted(11Garland A.M.

Cells were incubated with 0.01-1 μM GRP-10 in 250 μl of DMEM/BSA for 60 min at 4°C, washed, and incubated at 37°C for 0-60 min. They were then incubated with 0.1 μg/ml Flag antibody for 60 min at 4°C, washed 3 times for 5 min at 4°C, and incubated with 0.1 μCi/well of 125I-sheep anti-mouse IG for 60 min at 4°C. Cells were washed in PBS at 4°C, and lysed with 0.5 M NaOH overnight at room temperature. Radioactivity and protein content of the lysate were measured. Specific binding was determined by subtracting nonspecific binding to KNRK CMV cells from total binding. To calculate the extent of GRP-induced internalization, we compared the specific binding of KNRK Flag GRP-R cells treated with GRP to that of cells incubated with medium alone, but otherwise treated identically. Endocytosis can be inhibited by hyperosmolar sucrose, which blocks formation of clathrin-coated pits and interferes with bulk phase endocytosis in fibroblasts(23Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), and by phenylarsine oxide, which cross-links sulfur groups(24Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of these agents on endocytosis of GRP and GRP-R were examined. Cells were either preincubated with 0.45 M sucrose for 30 min at 37°C and 0.45 M sucrose was added to all solutions, or preincubated with 80 μM phenylarsine oxide for 5 min only, washed, and incubated in DMEM/BSA for 30 min at 37°C before the experiment(11Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The effects of cycloheximide, brefeldin A, and various acidotropic agents on recovery of cell-surface GRP-R were examined. Brefeldin A causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and mixing with the endoplasmic reticulum, and induces alterations in the morphological appearance of endosomes and lysosomes(25Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Acidotropic agents used included bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase(26Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17707-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and monensin, which prevents intracellular degradation of 125I-substance P(11Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with 70 μM cycloheximide, 1 μM bafilomycin A1, 50 μM monensin, or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A for 30-60 min at 37°C before addition of GRP, and the drugs were included in all solutions during the experiment. Control cells were incubated with appropriate carrier solutions. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between multiple groups are examined by an analysis of variance and a Student-Newman Keuls test or a Bonferroni t test. A p < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The Flag GRP-R was fully functional, as assessed by binding experiments using 125I-GRP and by measurement of GRP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Scatchard analysis indicated that KNRK Flag GRP-R cells expressed 0.3 × 106 sites per cell with an apparent kd of 0.7 nM. The EC50 for GRP-induced Ca2+ mobilization was 0.42 nM. KNRK GRP-R cells expressed 2 × 106 sites per cells with a similar kd and EC50 as the KNRK Flag GRP-R cells(19Slice L.W. Wong H.C. Sternini C. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Walsh J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21755-21761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, KNRK Flag GRP-R cells expressed high affinity GRP-Rs that were coupled to Ca2+ mobilization. We have previously shown that the Flag epitope does not affect ligand binding, Ca2+ mobilization, or endocytosis of the neurokinin 1 receptor(11Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Vigna S. Bowden J.J. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lys0 GRP-27 was readily labeled with cyanine 3.18 and the products were separated by HPLC (Fig. 1A). Unlabeled GRP eluted from the HPLC column after 18.1 min, and fluorescent products eluted at 16.6 min (peak 1), 19.1 min (peak 2), and 20.2 min (peak 3). Peak 2 was obtained with a higher yield and produced a stronger signal on binding, and was used in all further experiments. Amino acid composition analysis indicated that approximately 20% of the starting material eluted as peak 2, and confirmed that peak 2 was Lys0 GRP-27. Mass spectrometry indicated a Mr of 3728.8, and that the peptide was labeled by a single cyanine molecule. The biological activity of GRP was not affected by the cyanine 3.18 group, since cy3-GRP induced a prompt increase in [Ca2+]i in KNRK Flag GRP-R cells with an EC50 of 0.15 nM, similar to that of unlabeled GRP-10 (Fig. 1B). This result is not surprising, since only the C-terminal nonapeptide of GRP is required for full activity(27Broccardo M. Falconieri Erspamer G. Melchiorri P. Negri L. de Castiglioni R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1975; 55: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and both substance P and neurokinin A labeled with cyanine 3.18 retain full biological activity (11Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). 2E. F. Grady and N. W. Bunnett, unpublished observations. The specificity of cy3-GRP binding to KNKR Flag GRP-R cells and the homogeneity of the cell population were examined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. KNRK Flag GRP-R cells incubated with cy3-GRP yielded at least 1 log fold greater intensity in the cyanine 3 channel than KNRK CMV control cells (Fig. 1C). At 4°C, a strong, crisp signal was localized to the cell surface (Fig. 2A). No fluorescent signal was detected when KNRK Flag GRP-R cells were preincubated with 1 μM GRP-10 for 30 min at 4°C, and then incubated with both cy3-GRP and 1 μM GRP-10 (Fig. 2B), or when KNRK-CMV cells were incubated with cy3-GRP. Since preincubation with excess unlabeled GRP blocked binding, cy3-GRP binds the GRP-R specifically in KNRK-Flag GRP-R cells. Biotinylated GRP-27 is also biologically active, and specifically interacts with the GRP-R on Swiss 3T3 cells(28Anton P.A. Reeve Jr., J.R. Rivier J.E. Vidrich A. Schepp W. Shanahan F. Peptides. 1991; 12: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, use of this ligand requires a secondary detection system, which can cause artifacts in fluorescence microscopy and flow analysis, and necessitates extensive controls. Since cy3-GRP is directly visualized, it can be used for flow analysis and sorting of receptor bearing cells based directly on receptor affinity or number, and is also ideally suited for direct observation of peptide internalization in living cells. We directly observed endocytosis of cy3-GRP in living KNRK Flag GRP-R cells to examine the precise timing and pathway of internalization. Cells incubated with cy3-GRP at 4°C were warmed to 37°C, during which time endocytosis was continuously monitored and sequential images captured. At 4°C, cy3-GRP was confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A). Within 2 min at 37°C, cy3-GRP was in numerous small vesicles underlying the cell surface, and there was diminished surface staining (Fig. 3B). After 10 and 30 min, cy3-GRP was evident in larger vesicles in a perinuclear region (Fig. 3, C and D). This process was uniform, since all cells in the field progressed at the same rate. In parallel experiments, after equilibrium binding of cy3-GRP (Fig. 3E), the temperature was raised to 18°C, which is permissive for endocytosis but does not allow delivery to lysosomes (29Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Within 2 min at 18°C, cy3-GRP was internalized into small vesicles beneath the cell surface (Fig. 3F). Cy3-GRP remained in small, peripherally located vesicles when the cells were maintained at 18°C for up to 40 min (Fig. 3H, 20 min). When these same cells were warmed to 37°C, cy3-GRP entered larger vesicles in a perinuclear region, suggesting that the larger more central vesicles are lysosomes. This agrees with previous studies showing that internalized 125I-GRP is degraded in pancreatic acinar cells by a mechanism partially sensitive to the acidotropic agent chloroquine(17Zhu W.-Y. Goke B. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G57-G64PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescently-labeled transferrin, epidermal growth factor, and low density lipoprotein have been used to study endocytosis(22van Renswoude J. Bridges K.R. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6186-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In contrast, small fluorescent peptides have not been widely used since they usually can be labeled on only 1 residue and therefore fluoresce weakly. Cy3-GRP not only generated a bright signal, but enabled sequential visualization of the same cell, which is often difficult with a rapidly photobleached fluorophore such as FITC. Based on our observations with cy3-GRP, we selected specific time points to examine endocytosis of GRP and its receptor in more detail. We incubated KNRK Flag GRP-R cells with cy3-GRP and fixed the cells at various times after warming to 37°C to (a) examine the uniformity of endocytosis in multiple cells; (b) investigate in detail the intracellular distribution of the peptide; and (c) make direct comparisons between these results and those showing the distribution of internalized GRP-R. In all cells examined, cy3-GRP was confined to the plasma membrane at 4°C (Fig. 4A), and internalized into superficial vesicles after 5 min at 37°C (Fig. 4B). After 10 min, cy3-GRP was predominantly localized in larger vesicles although also present in small superficial vesicles (Fig. 4C). By 30 min, cy3-GRP was found in large vesicles near the nucleus. At 60 and 120 min, cy3-GRP was observed in large, central vesicles and there was also diffuse central staining (Fig. 4D). Labeling of the plasma membrane was not observed at the later time points, suggesting that GRP did not recycle to the cell surface. We compared the distribution of the GRP-R with that of cy3-GRP at the same times. KNRK Flag GRP-R cells were incubated with unlabeled GRP-10 at 4°C, and warmed to 37°C. At 4°C, GRP-R immunoreactivity, like cy3-GRP, was confined to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5A). After 5 min at 37°C, GRP-R was detected in numerous small vesicles located beneath the cell surface, similar to those containing cy3-GRP (Fig. 5B). After 10 min, the GRP-R was present in vesicles in a perinuclear region (Fig. 5C). After 30 and 60 min the intracellular staining had declined, and the plasma membrane was again strongly stained (Fig. 5D). This recovery of surface GRP-R immunoreactivity is in contrast to the distribution of cy3-GRP, which remained inside the cell. We used confocal microscopy to confirm that the punctate pattern of staining was due to internalization of the receptor into vesicles rather than its aggregation in the plasma membrane, and to more precisely examine the distribution of the receptor. At 4°C, GRP-R immunoreactivity was confined to the plasma membrane in optical sections just below the plasma membrane and through the center of the cell (Fig. 6A). No large pools of preformed intracellular GRP-R were detectable. After 5"

Human RPA is composed of subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa with intrinsic DNA-binding activity localized to the 616-amino acid, 70-kDa subunit (RPA70). We have made a series of C-terminal deletions to map the functional domains of RPA70. Deletion of the C terminus resulted in polypeptides that were significantly more soluble than RPA70 but were unable to form stable complexes with the other two subunits of RPA. These data suggest that the C-terminal region of RPA70 may be important for complex formation. The DNA-binding domain was localized to a region of RPA70 between residues 1 and 441. A mutant containing residues 1-441 bound oligonucleotides with an intrinsic affinity close to wild-type RPA complex. This mutant also appeared to bind with reduced cooperativity. We conclude that the C terminus of RPA70 and the 32- and 14-kDa subunits are not involved directly with interactions with DNA but may have a role in cooperativity of RPA binding.

NIFNE was purified using a modification of the published protocol. Immunoblot analysis of anoxic native gels indicated that distinct forms of NIFNE accumulate in strains deficient in either NIFB (ΔnifB::kan ΔnifDK) or NIFH (ΔnifHDK). During the purification of NIFNE from the ΔnifHDK mutant, its mobility in these gels changed, becoming similar to that of NIFNE from the ΔnifB::kan ΔnifDK mutant. While NIFB activity initially co-purified with the NIFNE activity from the ΔnifHDK mutant, further purification of NIFNE activity resulted in the loss of the co-purifying NIFB activity; this loss correlated with the change in NIFNE mobility on native gels. These results suggest that the form of NIFNE accumulated in the ΔnifHDK mutant is associated with NIFB activity in crude extract but loses this association during NIFNE purification. Addition of the purified metabolic product of NIFB, termed NifB-co, to either NIFNE purified from the ΔnifHDK strain or to the NIFNE in crude extract of the ΔnifB::kan ΔnifDK strain caused a change in the mobility of NIFNE on anoxic native gels to that of the form accumulated in a ΔnifHDK mutant.

While NIFB activity initially co-purified with the NIFNE activity from the ΔnifHDK mutant, further purification of NIFNE activity resulted in the loss of the co-purifying NIFB activity; this loss correlated with the change in NIFNE mobility on native gels. These results suggest that the form of NIFNE accumulated in the ΔnifHDK mutant is associated with NIFB activity in crude extract but loses this association during NIFNE purification. Addition of the purified metabolic product of NIFB, termed NifB-co, to either NIFNE purified from the ΔnifHDK strain or to the NIFNE in crude extract of the ΔnifB::kan ΔnifDK strain caused a change in the mobility of NIFNE on anoxic native gels to that of the form accumulated in a ΔnifHDK mutant. These results support a model where both NifB-co and dinitrogenase reductase participate in FeMo-co synthesis through NIFNE, which serves as a scaffold for this process."

Chem. 266, 7864-7869), we reported that a 15-17-base pair DNA sequence (designated a Barbie box element) in the 5′-regulatory regions of cytochrome P450BM−1and P450BM−3 genes from Bacillus megaterium was recognized by a barbiturate-regulated protein. It is now recognized that essentially all eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes whose 5′-flanking regions are known and that encode barbiturate-inducible proteins contain the Barbie box element. A 4-base pair sequence (AAAG) is found in the same relative position in all Barbie box elements. In B. megaterium, mutation of the Barbie box located in the P450BM−1 gene leads to the constitutive synthesis of cytochrome P450BM−1 and a 10-fold increase of expression of Bm1P1, a small gene located upstream of the P450BM−1 gene, that encodes a putative regulatory protein. Mutation of the P450BM−3 Barbie box significantly increased the expression of both P450BM−3 and Bm3P1 (another small gene located upstream of the P450BM−3 gene that encodes a second putative regulatory protein) in response to pentobarbital induction but left the basal levels unaffected. In gel mobility shift assays, Bm3R1, a repressor of the P450BM−3 gene, was found to specifically interact with the Barbie box sequences of the B. megaterium P450 genes. Mutated Barbie boxes showed a decreased binding affinity for Bm3R1 compared to their wild type (unmutated) counterparts. Barbie box sequences were also shown to specifically interact with putative positive regulatory factors of B. megaterium cells. These putative positive factors were induced by pentobarbital and were also present at high levels during late stationary phase of B. megaterium cell cultures grown in the absence of barbiturates. The mutated Barbie box sequences had greater binding affinity for these positive factors than did unmutated Barbie box sequences. DNase I footprinting analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM−1 gene revealed that these positive factors protected a segment of DNA covering a portion of the Barbie box sequence and a small flanking region. Similar footprinting experiments with the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM−3 gene failed, however, to unambiguously reveal protected sequences in the Barbie box region. The evidence suggests that the positive factors and Bm3R1 compete with each other for binding to the Barbie box region, especially in the 5′-flanking region of the P450BM−1 gene, and for putative roles in the regulation of transcription from the B. megaterium P450 genes. This inference was further supported by evidence derived from a nested-deletion analysis in and around the Barbie box of the P450BM−1 regulatory region that showed that a repressor binding site and a positive factor binding site overlap at the Barbie box sequence. In toto, these experimental results indicate that, in B. megaterium at least, the Barbie box sequences are important cis-acting elements for coordinately regulating the barbiturate-mediated expression of the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes and the genes encoding their positive regulatory factors. In a previous publication (He, J.-S., and Fulco, A. J.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7864-7869), we reported that a 15-17-base pair DNA sequence (designated a Barbie box element) in the 5′-regulatory regions of cytochrome P450BM−1and P450BM−3 genes from Bacillus megaterium was recognized by a barbiturate-regulated protein.

Cytochromes P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 are two barbiturate-inducible P450 monooxygenases from Bacillus megaterium that were discovered, cloned, sequenced, and characterized in our laboratory(1Fulco A.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1991; 31: 177-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). P450BM−1 (molecular mass 47.5 kilodaltons) shows sequence similarity to P450CAM and to several other bacterial P450s and is moderately barbiturate-inducible(2Schwalb H. Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. Biochim.

We subsequently cloned the genes encoding these two P450s, including the apparently complete regulatory regions, studied them with respect to the regulation of their expression, and adduced experimental evidence that barbiturate-mediated induction of P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 of B. megaterium may be mechanistically related to the analogous induction of cytochromes P4502B1 and P4502B2 of the rat(1Fulco A.J.

Analyses of the 5′-regulatory sequences of the genes encoding these four P450 cytochromes revealed a string of 17 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePCRpolymerase chain reaction. in the 5′-flanking region of each that shared a high degree of sequence identity. Labeled oligonucleotide probes of each of these sequences were tested in gel retardation assays with protein obtained from B. megaterium grown either in the presence or absence of barbiturates or with protein from nuclear extracts from livers of rats left untreated or injected with phenobarbital. Each of the four 17-mers bound strongly to a single protein in partially fractionated extracts from bacteria grown in the absence of barbiturates but this binding was dramatically reduced when extracts from pentobarbital- or phenobarbital-grown cells were used. Conversely, the probes complexed weakly to one protein band from nuclear extracts from untreated rats but much more strongly with protein from phenobarbital-treated rats. Similar effects could be obtained by prolonged incubation with phenobarbital of either soluble protein from the bacteria grown in the absence of barbiturates or nuclear extract protein from untreated rats. The potential importance of this sequence, designated a “Barbie box” (18Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is highlighted by the observation that essentially all of the eukaryotic genes whose 5′-flanking regions are known and which encode barbiturate-inducible proteins contain 15 bp sequences (the last 15 bp of the 17 bp sequences) that are highly homologous to the 15-bp Barbie box sequence of the P450BM−3 gene and to a consensus sequence that strongly binds the barbiturate-regulated proteins of rat and B. megaterium. These sequences are shown in Table 1. In particular, there is an identical 4-bp sequence (AAAG) that is found in the same relative location within the 15-bp Barbie box sequence of each gene that seems to be critical for DNA-protein interaction. One somewhat baffling finding reported in our published results (4He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was that the barbiturate-regulated rat protein that bound to Barbie box sequences appeared to be a positive regulator (i.e. was induced or transformed into a DNA-binding protein by barbiturates) while the barbiturate-negatively regulated bacterial protein appeared to be a repressor. Our results reported here offer a possible explanation to this puzzle and establish the critical nature of the Barbie box. We have now detected several proteins from B. megaterium in cells grown in the presence of barbiturates which, like the putative repressor previously identified, bind to the Barbie box. These protein factors may be analogous to the rat positive regulatory factor and may function by binding to the Barbie box and displacing the repressor. As the results we report here indicate, this putative repressor is probably identical to Bm3R1, a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding protein shown previously to bind, in the absence of barbiturates, to a 20-bp palindromic operator sequence near the promoter region of the P450BM−3 gene(17Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of inducer-barbiturates, however, Bm3R1 is inhibited from binding to its operator and induction ensues(18Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also present evidence in the present report that the induction of P450BM−1 by barbiturates may also involve competition between a positive DNA-binding protein and the Bm3R1 repressor.Tabled 1 base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) chloramphenicol acetyltransferase polymerase chain reaction. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and DNase I were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. Taq DNA polymerase was a product of Promega.

Poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC) and Nest-DeletionTM kits were from Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology. SequenaseTM kit and Escherichia coli vector pTZ19R were from U. S. Biochemical Corp. GeneCleanTM kits were ordered from BIO 101 Inc. The genes encoding cytochromes P450BM−1 and P450BM-3, including 5′-flanking regulatory regions, were cloned and sequenced in our laboratory(3He J.-S. Ruettinger R.T. Liu H.-M. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Ruettinger R.T. Wen L.-P. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10987-10995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); these sequences are available under GeneBank accession numbers X16610 and J04832, respectively. All chemicals used in the experiments were reagent grade. The 5′-regulatory regions of the P450BM−1 gene (0.5 kb) and the P450BM−3 gene (1.6 kb) were each cloned into plasmid vector pTZ19R. Oligonucleotide primers (designated BB1-1, BB1-2, BB3-1, and BB3-2) used for the introduction of mutations into the Barbie boxes of the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes by PCR are described in Fig. 1. Each pair of mutant oligonucleotides contained a Barbie box sequence with 2 bp changes in the most conserved sequence (AAAG in the wild type) as shown in Table 1. PCR was set up as reported previously (19Liang Q. Richardson T. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 730-735PubMed Google Scholar) except that 3 mM MgCl2 was substituted for 1.5 mM MgCl2 in the reaction. For introducing mutations in the Barbie box of P450BM−1, the reaction was carried out in an automatic thermal cycler for 4 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 0.5 min at 72°C and then for 20 cycles of 1 min at 92°C, 1 min at 58°C, and 0.5 min at 72°C. The 72°C incubation of the last cycle was extended for an extra 5 min before the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The DNA region (250 bp) between the 5′ end of the P450BM−1 regulatory region and the P450BM−1 wild type Barbie box (BB1) was mutated and amplified by PCR with primer BB1-2 and the universal primer for the vector pTZ19R. The DNA region (370 bp) between BB1 and the 3′ end of the P450BM−1 regulatory region was mutated and amplified by PCR with primer BB1-1 and the reverse primer from the vector. After treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dNTP, these two mutated DNA fragments (250 and 370 bp) were purified by low melt agarose electrophoresis and GeneCleanTM kit. The whole length of mutated P450BM−1 regulatory region (0.5 kb) was produced by placing the two mutated DNA fragments (overlapping at the BB1 sequence) in the PCR cycler for 10 cycles of 1 min at 92°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C and then for 10 cycles of PCR amplification with the universal and reverse primers. The mutated P450BM−1 regulatory region was digested with HindIII and cloned into pTZ19R. The same strategy, employing PCR was used for site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type Barbie box (BB3) of the P450BM−3 regulatory region. The mutated P450BM−3 regulatory region (1.6 kb) was also cloned into pTZ19R. Both the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 mutated regulatory regions were further analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm the desired mutations in the Barbie boxes. E. coli DH5α (recA-, F-, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, hsdR17, supE44, relA1) was used for plasmid transformation and preparation. A plasmid vector, pTZ19R, was used for recombinant DNA manipulation. Plasmid pUBCAT(16Wen L.-P. Ruettinger R.T. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10996-11003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an E. coli-B. megaterium shuttle vector containing a promoterless CAT gene, was utilized for analysis of Barbie box effects on the transcriptional regulation of the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes. B. megaterium ATCC 14581, the original strain from which the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes were cloned in our laboratory(3He J.-S. Ruettinger R.T. Liu H.-M. Fulco A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Ruettinger R.T. Wen L.-P. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10987-10995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the wild type source for analysis of transcriptional regulation of the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes and derived constructs. A B. megaterium ATCC 14581 mutant (designated G39E) constitutive for the expression of cytochrome P450BM−3 and previously characterized as resulting from a point mutation in the bm3R1 gene (17Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was also used in some of the experiments presented here. E. coli JM109 was used as a host for overexpression of wild type and mutant Bm3R1 protein(17Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After confirming, by sequence analysis, that we had obtained the desired mutations in the Barbie box sequences, the mutated and wild type P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 regulatory regions, respectively, were cloned into pUBCAT in both orientations using the unique HindIII site on the vector. Eight heterologous CAT constructs were produced and designated pcat1A, pcat1mA, pcat1B, pcat1mB, pcat3A, pcat3mA, pcat3B and pcat3 mB (Fig. 2). Cell free extracts of B. megaterium cells were prepared as described previously (14Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2147-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. B. megaterium cells were grown at 35°C in 500 ml of BM medium, and harvested in early stationary phase. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of 25 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Then, the cells were broken by pulsed sonication. The resulting preparation was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min to remove debris. The same procedure was used to prepare protein extract from E. coli cells carrying pGS101 (for overproduction of Bm3R1) or pGS102 (for overproduction of mutant Bm3R1)(17Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the preparations from E. coli cells were treated with (NH4)2SO4 (40% of saturation) and the precipitate was collected(18Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitated proteins, containing Bm3R1 or mutant Bm3R1, were resuspended in 5 ml of 25 mM Tris-Cl, and dialyzed against 2 × 2 liters of 25 mM Tris-Cl buffer to remove the salt. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay was based on Sleigh's procedure (20Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 20 μl of 8 mM chloramphenicol, 10 μl of 40,000 × g cell-free extract (with a protein concentration of 0.2-1.0 mg/ml), 50 μl of 0.15 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.8), and 20 μl of acetyl-CoA (5 μCi/ml [1-14C]acetyl-CoA plus 0.5 mM unlabeled acetyl-CoA). After incubating the mixture for 30 min to 1 h at 37°C (the time of incubation was dependent on the CAT activity of the cell extract), the reaction mixture was heated at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate deacetylases. The samples were then transferred to an ice bath and 100 μl of distilled H2O and 200 μl of ice-cold ethyl acetate were added. After the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 20 s and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, 100 μl of upper organic phase was transferred to a counting vail, mixed with 5 ml of scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. A series of 5′ to 3′ deletion derivatives of the P450BM−1 regulatory region were generated as reported previously(4He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five deletion derivatives around the BB1 region, harboring 345-, 329-, 318-, 308-, and 294-bp portions of the P450BM−1 regulatory region (517 bp in length; Fig. 9A), were selected and cloned into the pUBCAT shuttle vector. For the P450BM−3 regulatory region (a 1.6-kb DNA segment inserted into vector pTZ19R), a unidirectional deletion from the 5′ end was performed according to the manufacturer's (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology) protocol included with the Nest-DeletionTM kit with the 3′ overhanging end of a KpnI site serving as the protected end to exonuclease III action and the 5′ overhanging end of a SalI site as the deletion end. A deletion derivative (pBM3-9) carrying a 447-bp portion of the P450BM−3 regulatory region (containing BB3) was selected for footprinting analysis. The gel mobility shift assay was a modification of a standard procedure (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 1-9Google Scholar) for the detection of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Each pair of Barbie box oligonucleotides (Fig. 1) was annealed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl by incubating the mixture at 70°C for 10 min and then cooling slowly to room temperature. After radioactive labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, the double-stranded DNA probe was purified on a small filtration column. The binding reaction was set up in a total volume of 30 μl by mixing 4 ng of DNA probe and various amounts of cell extract (0.5-20 μg of protein) in a binding buffer consisting of 12 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 4 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, 1 μg of double stranded poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC), and 10 ng of the single stranded oligonucleotides, 5′-GGAATTCGTAATGAGATAAGCAGTTCGC-3′. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis in 1 × Tris glycine buffer. The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel was dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography. The P450BM−1 regulatory region portion of the 385-bp segment containing BB1 was obtained by PCR amplification with the introduction of an EcoRI site at its 5′ end and a HindIII site at its 3′ end. The DNA fragment was digested at the 5′ end with EcoRI, filled in with [α-32P]dNTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and purified by gel filtration. For footprinting analysis on the P450BM−3 regulatory region, pBM3-9 was digested with SalI and then labeled with [α-32P]dNTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The P450BM−3 DNA fragment was excised by HindIII digestion to render it one end-labeled and then purified by low melt agarose gel electrophoresis and by use of the GeneCleanTM kit. The footprinting reaction was set up in a total volume of 30 μl which contained 1 μl of probe (about 5 ng DNA), 20 μl of cell extract (0.25-2 mg/ml of proteins), 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)•(dI-dC), 12 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 12 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature the samples were placed into an ice bath for 10 min. Following a 2-min incubation of the samples at 25°C, 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 ng of DNase I were added to digest unprotected regions of DNA for 40 s at 25°C before the addition of 100 μl of stop solution (1 M ammonium acetate, 200 μg/ml tRNA, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. After vacuum drying, each sample was resuspended in 8 μl of loading buffer (50% deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol) and heated at 75°C for 2 min before 4-μl samples were loaded onto the gel. The chemical (Maxam-Gilbert) sequencing reaction (G + A) was carried out exactly as described in a standard procedure (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 1-9Google Scholar). The introduction of site-specific mutations in Barbie box sequences by PCR is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting mutant Barbie boxes and their wild type counterparts are shown in Fig. 1. Because both P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 Barbie boxes (BB1 and BB3) are located in coding regions, the mutations in BB1 and BB3 were designed to produce no change or minimum change in the corresponding polypeptide sequences. In BB1, the highly conserved sequence AAAG was mutated to GAAC with the two corresponding amino acid residues Leu and Phe changed to similar residues, Val and Leu in the predicted polypeptide sequence. Although the function of the polypeptide encoded by this open reading frame has not yet been fully characterized, the 2-amino acid residue change resulting from the mutations in BB1 did not result in a significant change in the protein secondary structure as predicted by computer analysis (MacVectorTM Protein Analysis Toolbox). For BB3, the change from AAAG to GAAA involved silent mutations since no amino acid residue was changed in the Bm3R1 protein, a repressor for the P450BM−3 gene(17Shaw G.-C. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5515-5526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” wild type and mutated regulatory sequences of both P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 were cloned into the E. coli-B. megaterium shuttle vector, pUBCAT, each in both orientations. The resulting eight different heterologous CAT constructs are illustrated as in Fig. 2. In the “A orientation,” the promoterless CAT gene was placed just downstream from the 5′ coding regions (5 amino acid residues for the P450BM−1 constructs; 27 amino acid residues for the P450BM−3 constructs) of P450 genes. Since there are three stop codons upstream from the AUG start codon of the CAT gene, no translational read-through into the CAT coding region is possible and the effects of a mutation in a Barbie box would be directly reported by the promoterless CAT gene. The 5′-regulatory regions of the P450BM−1 and P450BM−3 genes each contain a small open reading frame in the opposite orientation to and upstream from the P450 coding region. In the 5′-regulatory region of P450BM−1, the two opposite promoters overlap (Fig. 2); in P450BM−3, the two opposite promoters are adjacent. Based on the structural relationships and orientations of these promoters, it was conceivable that mutations in the Barbie box sequences could affect transcription of the two small coding regions. To test this hypothesis, we placed the CAT reporter gene at the 5′ ends of the regulatory sequences of the P450BM−1and P450BM−3 genes (the “B orientation” constructs in Fig. 2). All eight CAT constructs were used to transform B. megaterium ATCC 14581. Each pair of constructs containing the wild type or mutant Barbie boxes were analyzed for CAT expression in the resulting transformed cells under identical conditions (Fig. 3). Under our normal overnight growth conditions (15-16 h of culture growth in the presence or absence of 4 mM pentobarbital), B. megaterium cells harboring pcat1A (wild type BB1) produced a significant level of CAT activity in the absence of barbiturate and this activity increased about 2.5-fold when the cells were grown in the presence of 4 mM pentobarbital (Fig. 3A). We were surprised to find, however, that the cells carrying pcat1 mA (mutant Barbie box BB1m) expressed CAT at a high constitutive level and showed no response to growth in the presence of pentobarbital. Thus, it seemed likely that the 2-bp mutation in BB1 resulted in the elimination of or a significant decrease in repressor binding, so that the repressor was unable compete with positive factors for the BB1 region. For constructs of pcat3A (wild type BB3) and pcat3 mA (mutant BB3m), the basal levels of CAT expression in the transformants were essentially the same. However, pcat3 mA produced a higher induced level of CAT activity than pcat3A (Fig. 3C). The former showed a 9-fo"

This endo/exonuclease has been shown to be highly homologous to human XP-G, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD2, and S. cerevisiae YKL510. Like FEN-1, these related structure-specific nucleases recognize and cleave a branched DNA structure called a DNA flap and its derivative, called a pseudo Y-structure. To dissect the important structural components of the DNA flap structure, we have developed a mobility shift assay. We find that the Fadj strand (located adjacent to the displaced flap strand) is necessary for efficient binding and cleavage of flap structures by FEN-1. When this strand is absent or when it is present, but recessed from the elbow of the flap strand, binding efficiency drops. Further investigation of the role of the Fadj strand using double flap structures reveals that the Fadj strand is necessary to provide a double-stranded template upon which FEN-1 can bind near the elbow of the flap strand. These results provide a basis for understanding how this structure-specific nuclease recognizes a variety of DNA substrates.

These results provide a basis for understanding how this structure-specific nuclease recognizes a variety of DNA substrates. DNA flap structures have been proposed to be important intermediates in many DNA metabolic reactions. During DNA replication, for example, displacement of an upstream primer by the incoming polymerase results in the formation of a 5′-flap structure(1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 931Google Scholar). The formation and resolution of this structure may allow certain types of DNA damage to be removed from the DNA duplex. Likewise, other repair processes may also occur via flap intermediates. DNA flaps have been proposed in homologous recombination(2Pont K.G. Dawson R.J. Carroll D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), double-strand break repair (3Roth D.B. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4295-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and nucleotide excision repair(5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A structure-specific endonuclease capable of resolving DNA flap structures has been purified and characterized(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This enzyme, called FEN-1 (flap endonuclease-1), cleaves 5′-flap structures endonucleolytically and has a double strand-specific 5′-3′-exonuclease activity. Because these activities are similar to the activities of exonuclease VI (the 5′-3′-exonuclease domain of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I) (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 931Google Scholar) and identical to an activity necessary for in vitro DNA replication by mammalian cell extracts(6Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 7Waga S. Bauer G. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10923-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that FEN-1 plays a role in replication(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether FEN-1 also plays a role in DNA recombination and repair. The murine gene that encodes FEN-1 has been identified and shown to be highly homologous to the RAD2 gene family(5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Within this family, FEN-1 is most homologous in sequence and structure to Saccharomyces cerevisiae YKL510 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad2. Although these gene products have no known biological function at this time, YKL510 and FEN-1 have been shown to have identical enzymatic activities. This suggests that YKL510 (and presumably S. pombe Rad2) is the yeast analog of FEN-1 and likely plays a role in DNA replication. Other members of this family include the nucleotide excision repair genes RAD2 (S. cerevisiae), RAD13 (S. pombe), and XP-G (human). Analysis of enzymatic specificity confirms that a truncated form of S. cerevisiae Rad2 is a structure-specific endonuclease that cleaves flap and pseudo Y-structures(5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This suggests that these structures may be important intermediates in nucleotide excision repair. Furthermore, the relationship between XP-G and FEN-1 raises the possibility that mutation of the FEN-1 gene may result in a disease phenotype similar to xeroderma pigmentosum. The recent cloning and mapping of the human FEN-1 gene indicate that FEN-1 does not map to any known congenital disease locus(8Hiraoka L. Harrington J.J. Gerhard D.S. Lieber M.R. Hsieh C.-L. Genomics. 1995; 25: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although alterations in malignant somatic cells remain a possibility. As the role of flap structures in DNA metabolism is becoming more clear, it is necessary to understand the important components of this structure that are necessary for recognition by this family of structure-specific nucleases. Although the substrate specificity of FEN-1 has been characterized using a variety of nuclease assays, many questions related to the recognition of DNA structures by FEN-1 can not be answered by this approach. Specifically, the important structural components of many nucleic acid substrates cannot be dissected because small changes in structure result in an inability of FEN-1 to cleave the substrate. To answer questions regarding substrate recognition by FEN-1, we have developed a mobility shift assay using a labeled DNA flap structure as a probe. The study described here is aimed at providing a foundation upon which a better understanding of the substrate recognition by structure-specific nucleases can be reached. FEN-1 was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously(5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The final purity of FEN-1 was >95%. All DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). The sequence of each is shown after its name and is written 5′ to 3′: SC1, CAGCAACGCAAGCTTG; SC3, GTCGACCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGCGTTGCTG; SC5, ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGGCTGCAGGTCGAC; AI4, GGCCGTATCTGGGTTCGAATTCATCAAGGGACATCTCCTAC; HJ46, CCTATCGTTGCATGGTGCCAGAACCCAGATACGGC; HJ47, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAATTC; HJ73, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAATT; HJ74, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAA; HJ75, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATG; HJ77, GTAGGAGAT GTCCCTTGATGAATTCC; HJ78, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAATTCCTTGTGTTTC; CLH2, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAATT; CLH3, CGAACCCAGATACGGC; and CLH6, GTAGGAGATGTCCCTTGATGAATTCGAACCCAGATACGGC. The standard endonuclease assay has been described previously(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, FEN-1 endonuclease activity was measured in a 15-μl reaction containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 fmol of labeled substrate. Reactions were carried out at 30°C for 30 min and terminated by adding 15 μl of 95% formamide, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol. The tubes were heated to 95°C for 5 min, loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea and 1 × TBE (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8)), and run for 90 min at 75 watts. One unit of FEN-1 activity produces 1 fmol of cleaved product under these standard reaction conditions. Binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 ng (10 fmol) of labeled oligonucleotide probe, and the indicated amount of FEN-1. Following a 5-min incubation at 20°C, the reactions were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE and run at 125 V for 90 min. The gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens to allow quantitation of bands. When more than one oligonucleotide composes a multi-oligonucleotide competitor structure (e.g. AI4/HJ46/HJ47 in a flap structure) in any of the figures, the mass given in the figure is only for the oligonucleotide AI4, and an equimolar quantity of the other oligonucleotides listed in the name of the structure is added in addition to constitute the complete competitor structure. The recognition of unusual DNA structures by endonucleases is poorly understood at this time. In part, this is due to the lack of purified and cloned structure-specific nucleases. The structure-specific nuclease FEN-1 has now been cloned, overexpressed, and purified and therefore is a good candidate for carrying out substrate binding studies. To characterize the substrate binding characteristics of FEN-1, we have developed a mobility shift assay. Because FEN-1 is a potent nuclease in the presence of divalent metal ions, EDTA was included in the binding reaction to remove residual metal ions. Under these conditions, FEN-1 was found to bind to the DNA flap structure in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). This dose response was linear between 10 and 60 ng of FEN-1 under the standard binding conditions. In this range of FEN-1 concentrations, a single shifted species was observed. Although we cannot rule out Mg2+ being involved in the binding, we believe this to be unlikely because the substrate binding properties of purified FEN-1 in the absence of Mg2+ are entirely consistent with the endonucleolytic activity of FEN-1 in the presence of Mg2+ (see below). To determine the specificity of FEN-1 for the 5′-flap structure in the mobility shift assay, we titrated various nucleic acid competitors into the binding reaction (Fig. 2). Double- and single-stranded DNAs compete inefficiently in this assay. An ∼1000-fold molar excess of these competitors was needed to fully compete the binding of FEN-1 away from the labeled flap structure. tRNA failed to compete for FEN-1 binding even when present in a 1000-fold molar excess over labeled substrate. These results are consistent with the inhibition profiles of these nucleic acid competitors in the standard flap endonuclease assay(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The binding specificity of FEN-1 was further characterized by titrating derivatives of the flap structure into the reaction (Fig. 3). Unlike double- and single-stranded DNAs, a 40-fold excess of unlabeled 5′-flap structure was sufficient to fully compete the binding of FEN-1 away from the labeled flap substrate. In addition, we found that the entire flap structure was required for optimal competition to occur. The pseudo Y-structure, which was missing the Fadj strand, competed 3-fold less efficiently than the 5′-flap structure. Furthermore, the 5′-overhang, which was missing the flap strand, competed 4-fold less efficiently than the 5′-flap structure, but 5-fold more efficiently than single-stranded DNA. This indicates that the presence of the Fadj strand enhances the binding of FEN-1 to this overhang structure. Thus, the reduction in binding of FEN-1 to the pseudo Y-structure (compared with the 5′-flap structure) and the enhancement in binding of FEN-1 to the 5′-overhang (compared with single-stranded DNA) demonstrate the importance of the Fadj strand in the binding step of this reaction. In addition to binding, we have shown that the Fadj strand is required for efficient cleavage of the flap strand. The efficiency of cleavage correlated with the proximity of the 3′-end of the Fadj strand to the elbow of the flap strand(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether these recessed Fadj strands were cleaved inefficiently due to a reduced ability of FEN-1 to bind to these substrates. To test this, we carried out the binding reaction in the presence of unlabeled 5′-flap structures with various gap sizes between the Fadj strand and the flap strand elbow (Fig. 4). We found that the ability of FEN-1 to bind to the flap structure efficiently was dependent upon the proximity of the Fadj strand to the elbow of the flap strand. This result suggests that the inability of FEN-1 to efficiently cleave 5′-flap structures with large gaps between the Fadj strand and the flap strand elbow is due, at least in part, to the failure of FEN-1 to bind to this substrate. Interestingly, FEN-1 binds to a 5nucleotide gap more efficiently than to a pseudo Y-structure. This indicates that the 5-nucleotide recessed Fadj strand is capable of partially stabilizing FEN-1 binding, thereby suggesting that FEN-1 contacts the Fadj strand at >5 nucleotides from the flap strand elbow. We have demonstrated the importance of the Fadj strand for the binding and cleavage of a 5′-flap structure by FEN-1. The exact role that the Fadj strand plays in the recognition of this structure by FEN-1, however, is not clear. For example, does FEN-1 require a fully base-paired 3′-terminus located in juxtaposition to the elbow of the flap strand, or does FEN-1 simply require that the region near the elbow of the flap strand be double-stranded? To determine which of these two possibilities is correct, we designed a flap substrate that contained an Fadj strand that had either 1 nucleotide or 10 nucleotides of extra sequence at the 3′-end. Thus, the base that contained the 3′-terminus was neither base-paired nor located in immediate juxtaposition to the elbow of the flap strand. This substrate, called a double flap structure, contained both a 5′- and a 3′-flap strand. Previously, we have shown that FEN-1 is not capable of cleaving 3′-flap strands(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Here, we were interested in determining whether a displaced 3′-flap strand can serve as an Fadj strand to allow efficient binding to this structure by FEN-1. In the mobility shift assay, we found that FEN-1 could bind a double flap efficiently (Fig. 5A). Double Flap 1 and the 5′-flap structure competed 3-5-fold more efficiently than Double Flap 2, which, in turn, competed 2-fold more efficiently compared with the pseudo Y-structure. This indicates that both a 1nucleotide and a 10-nucleotide 3′-flap strand can serve as an Fadj strand in the binding step of this reaction. Furthermore, this result indicates that the Fadj strand is required to create a double-stranded region next to the elbow of the flap strand rather than to supply a base-paired 3′-terminus. The ability of FEN-1 to bind to a double flap structure suggests that FEN-1 may be capable of cleaving the 5′-flap strand on this structure. To test this, we carried out the standard flap endonuclease assay. As determined previously(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), FEN-1 cleaves the flap strand of a 5′-flap structure efficiently; however, it cleaves a pseudo Y-structure ∼100-fold less efficiently. When Double Flaps 1 and 2 were tested in this cleavage assay, we found that the 1- and 10-nucleotide 3′-flap strands served as an Fadj strand, allowing FEN-1 to cleave the 5′-flap strand efficiently (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, cleavage of the double flap structures by FEN-1 was more efficient than that of the standard 5′-flap structure. The ability of FEN-1 to cleave the double flap structure raises important questions regarding the types of structures FEN-1 cleaves in vivo. In addition to flap cleavage activity, FEN-1 has been shown to have a 5′-3′-exonuclease activity that is dependent upon double-stranded DNA. Like the flap endonuclease, the 5′-3′-exonuclease is stimulated by the presence of an Fadj strand. Thus, the FEN-1 exonuclease is optimally active at a nick. To test the relative binding efficiency of FEN-1 on 5′-flap structures versus nicks, we compared the ability of these structures to compete in the mobility shift assay using a labeled flap substrate. We found that in this assay, a 5′-flap structure competed 2-4 times more efficiently than a nick structure (data not shown). In the cleavage assay, we found that FEN-1 cleaved flap structures severalfold more efficiently than nicks; however, there appears to be considerable variation among nicked DNA substrates. Substrate preference has been observed previously with CCA exonuclease (9Goulian M. Richards S.H. Heard C. Bigsby B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18461-18471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme that we believe to be the same as FEN-1. The basis for variability in substrate preference is not known at this time. The ability of nicked DNA to compete with FEN-1 binding to a 5′-flap structure suggests that we could use the mobility shift assay to dissect the important substrate features necessary for FEN-1 binding to DNA nicks. To test this, we labeled a nicked DNA substrate and carried out the mobility shift assay under standard binding and electrophoresis conditions. In this assay, FEN-1 did bind to a labeled nicked DNA substrate and retard its mobility on a native gel (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). Upon addition of unlabeled nicked DNA, the shifted substrate was no longer detectable in the presence of an 80-fold molar excess of competitor. In contrast, titration of unlabeled double-stranded DNA lacking a nick but containing the same nucleotide sequence failed to compete FEN-1 away from the labeled substrate completely, even in the presence of a 250-fold molar excess. This indicates that FEN-1 is recognizing some component of the nicked DNA structure. Analysis of the individual contribution of the Fadj strand and the 5′-recessed strand demonstrates that the Fadj strand is important in the binding step of this reaction. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that the calf thymus 5′-3′-exonuclease, the bovine analog of mouse FEN-1, requires the Fadj strand for efficient exonuclease activity(10Murante R. Huang L. Turchi J. Bambara R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1191-1196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments described here have identified the structural components of DNA flap structures that are recognized by FEN-1 in the binding portion of the cleavage reaction. The role of the Fadj strand, in particular, appears to play a pivotal role in the binding and cleavage steps of this reaction. When this strand is absent, FEN-1 binds to the 5′-flap structure ∼3-fold less efficiently. Because cleavage of the pseudo Y-structure is reduced by ∼100-fold, it appears that FEN-1 also requires the Fadj strand during the catalysis step of this reaction. In addition to the pseudo Y-structure, we found that FEN-1 binding to 5′-flap structures with recessed Fadj strands decreased to an extent proportional to the gap length between the 3′-terminus of the Fadj strand and the flap strand elbow. This effect correlated well with the reduction in FEN-1 cleavage using similar substrates reported previously(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of the Fadj strand in the binding portion (and probably the cleavage portion) of the nucleolytic reaction. Recently, it has been reported that FEN-1, referred to as DNase IV, cleaves pseudo Y-structures, but not bubble structures(11Robins P. Pappin D. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28535-28538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, flap structures were not analyzed. Although we have observed cleavage of pseudo Y-structures by FEN-1, cleavage was reduced by ∼20-100-fold compared with the flap structure(4Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that while cleavage of flap structures with different sequences was equally efficient, the same substrates that lacked the Fadj strand were cleaved with variable efficiency and at different cleavage sites. One explanation for this observation is that the single-stranded region of the Fbr strand (see the legend to Fig. 1 for nomenclature) snaps back to form a transient Fadj strand near the elbow of the flap strand, allowing FEN-1 to cleave. One would expect that the efficiency of snap-back would increase proportional to the length of the single-stranded region of the Fbr strand. In addition, one might expect snap-back within the single-stranded region of a bubble structure to be less efficient. Thus, it is possible that in cases where a low level of pseudo Y-structure cleavage is observed, a transient Fadj strand may be present. Further experiments, including detailed kinetic analysis, must be carried out to elucidate the mechanism of FEN-1 cleavage. Finally, the observation that FEN-1 cleaves the 5′-flap strand on a double flap structure raises an interesting question: do double flap structures form during normal cellular processes, and if so, is FEN-1 responsible for their resolution? Although a definitive answer is uncertain at this time, double flap structures have been hypothesized as intermediates in DNA end joining. Additionally, double flaps may form in some types of homologous recombination pathways that do not proceed through the classical Holliday junction. It is possible that FEN-1 resolves the 5′-flap and that some other enzyme cleaves the 3′-flap. It has been suggested that RAD1/RAD10 may be capable of cleaving 3′-flap and pseudo Y-structures(5Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and genetic evidence supports this hypothesis(12Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, this has been definitively demonstrated(13Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ultimate answers regarding the details of FEN-1/flap structure interactions will come upon co-crystallization of this complex. In the meantime, many important questions can be answered regarding enzyme/substrate interactions using a combination of mutagenesis, cleavage assays, and binding assays including the mobility shift assay described here."
https://openalex.org/W1969722894,"Two membrane-associated phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs (mPI-PLC-1 and mPI-PLC-2) and a cytosolic enzyme (cPI-PLC) that were activated by brain G-protein βγ subunits have been isolated from human platelets. The truncation of mPI-PLC-1 that was mediated by μ-calpain induced much higher activation by βγ subunits (Banno, Y., Asano, T., and Nozawa, Y.(1994) FEBS Lett. 340, 185-188). On the basis of size and immunological cross-reactivity, mPI-PLC-1 (155 kDa) was PLC-β3, and mPI-PLC-2 (100 kDa) was its truncated form. The cPI-PLC (140 kDa) was recognized by the antibody selective for internal sequences of PLC-β3 but not by the antibody raised against its carboxyl terminus, indicating that it may be related to PLC-β3.Treatment of human platelets with A23187 and dibucaine, activators of calpain, caused cleavage of actin-binding protein and talin in a time-dependent manner. At the same time, decrease of PLC-β3 (155 and 140 kDa) and concomitant increase of the 100-kDa product of cleavage were observed on immunoblots with the antibody to internal sequences of PLC-β3. Furthermore, stimulation of platelets by natural agonists, thrombin and collagen, caused the cleavage of PLC-β3 (155 and 140 kDa) and an increase of 100 kDa PLC-β3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cleavage of these PLC-β3 enzymes was completely blocked by calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, indicating that the PLC-β3 modification may be a consequence of platelet activation leading to activation of calpain. This is the first demonstration that PLC-β3 is indeed cleaved by calpain upon platelet activation by physiological agonists. The cleavage of PLC-β3 evoked by thrombin and collagen but not ADP was correlated with irreversible aggregation, suggesting that the PLC-β3 modification may play a role in secondary irreversible aggregation in agonist-stimulated human platelets. Two membrane-associated phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cs (mPI-PLC-1 and mPI-PLC-2) and a cytosolic enzyme (cPI-PLC) that were activated by brain G-protein βγ subunits have been isolated from human platelets. The truncation of mPI-PLC-1 that was mediated by μ-calpain induced much higher activation by βγ subunits (Banno, Y., Asano, T., and Nozawa, Y.(1994) FEBS Lett. 340, 185-188). On the basis of size and immunological cross-reactivity, mPI-PLC-1 (155 kDa) was PLC-β3, and mPI-PLC-2 (100 kDa) was its truncated form. The cPI-PLC (140 kDa) was recognized by the antibody selective for internal sequences of PLC-β3 but not by the antibody raised against its carboxyl terminus, indicating that it may be related to PLC-β3. Treatment of human platelets with A23187 and dibucaine, activators of calpain, caused cleavage of actin-binding protein and talin in a time-dependent manner. At the same time, decrease of PLC-β3 (155 and 140 kDa) and concomitant increase of the 100-kDa product of cleavage were observed on immunoblots with the antibody to internal sequences of PLC-β3. Furthermore, stimulation of platelets by natural agonists, thrombin and collagen, caused the cleavage of PLC-β3 (155 and 140 kDa) and an increase of 100 kDa PLC-β3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cleavage of these PLC-β3 enzymes was completely blocked by calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, indicating that the PLC-β3 modification may be a consequence of platelet activation leading to activation of calpain. This is the first demonstration that PLC-β3 is indeed cleaved by calpain upon platelet activation by physiological agonists. The cleavage of PLC-β3 evoked by thrombin and collagen but not ADP was correlated with irreversible aggregation, suggesting that the PLC-β3 modification may play a role in secondary irreversible aggregation in agonist-stimulated human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2013915902,"We have isolated a human cDNA clone encoding HIP116, a protein that binds to the SPH repeats of the SV40 enhancer and to the TATA/initiator region of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 promoter. The predicted HIP116 protein is related to the yeast SNF2/SWI2 transcription factor and to other members of this extended family and contains seven domains similar to those found in the vaccinia NTP1 ATPase. Interestingly, HIP116 also contains a C3HC4 zinc-binding motif (RING finger) interspersed between the ATPase motifs in an arrangement similar to that found in the yeast RAD5 and RAD16 proteins. The HIP116 amino terminus is unique among the members of this family, and houses a specific DNA-binding domain. Antiserum raised against HIP116 recognizes a 116-kDa nuclear protein in Western blots and specifically supershifts SV40 and HIV-1 protein-DNA complexes in gel shift experiments. The binding site for HIP116 on the SV40 enhancer directly overlaps the site for TEF-1, and like TEF-1, binding of HIP116 to the SV40 enhancer is destroyed by mutations that inhibit SPH enhancer activity in vivo. Purified fractions of HIP116 display strong ATPase activity that is preferentially stimulated by SPH DNA and can be inhibited specifically by antibodies to HIP116.

INTRODUCTIONActivation of RNA polymerase II transcription depends upon gene-specific DNA-binding proteins as well as factors that help enhancer-binding proteins to counter the repressive effects of chromatin structure.

The yeast SNF2/SWI2 protein controls expression of several classes of inducible genes (for review, see (9Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and are required for activated transcription by different enhancer-binding proteins, including, for example, several members of the steroid receptor superfamily(3Chiba H.

The Drosophila BRM protein is thought to act similarly to SNF2/SWI2 by countering the repressive effects of polycomb on homeotic gene transcription(7Tamkun J. Deuring R. Scott M. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A. Kaufman T. Kennison J. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Although SNF2/SWI2 appears to function within a multiprotein complex that is targeted indirectly to promoters, and is not itself a DNA-binding protein(1Peterson C. Herskowitz I. Cell. 1992; 68: 573-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Laurent B.C. Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the local chromatin structure at SNF2/SWI2-responsive promoters is altered in yeast strains carrying mutations in the snf2/swi2 gene(13Hirschhorn J. Brown S. Clark C. Winston F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and the snf2/swi2- mutant phenotype is suppressed in yeast strains that carry alterations in the genes encoding histone H2A, H2B, H3, or other chromatin-associated proteins(13Hirschhorn J. Brown S. Clark C. Winston F. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 14Kruger W. Herskowitz I. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5927-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that SNF2/SWI2 might act to help overcome nucleosomal repression of gene expression, for example, by perturbing chromatin structure to allow access of regulatory factors to their DNA binding sites. Indeed purified fractions of the multisubunit protein complex that contains SNF2/SWI2 have been shown to disrupt nucleosomes in vitro and enhance binding of the chimeric GAL4/VP16 activator to DNA(16Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which SNF2/SWI2 actively dissociates nucleosomes to facilitate binding of regulatory proteins to their control regions on the DNA.Recently, a large family of proteins have been identified that are more distantly related to SNF2/SWI2 in sequence and function. These include Mot1, a negative regulator of basal transcription that is essential for yeast mitotic growth(18Davis J. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G.F. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar); STH1, a protein of unknown function that is similarly essential for mitotic growth in yeast(20Laurent B. Yang X. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); lodestar, a protein that enters the nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner and is important for proper segregation of chromosomes in Drosophila(21Girdham C. Glover D. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1786-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); ERCC6, which mediates preferential repair of transcriptionally active genes and is disrupted in Cockayne's syndrome(22Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar); CHD-1, a putative transcription factor that binds directly to DNA(23Delmas V. Stokes D. Perry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2414-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); and RAD5, RAD16, and RAD54(24Emery H. Schild D. Kellog D. Mortimer R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Johnson R. Henderson S. Petes T. Prakash S. Bankmann M. Prakash L. Mol. Cell.

Yeast. 1992; 8: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which play a role in the repair of damaged DNA. These different SNF2/SWI2-related proteins are thus implicated in a wide variety of control processes, including gene expression, DNA repair, and control of chromosome segregation. The region most conserved among the different SNF2/SWI2-related proteins spans seven co-linearly arranged motifs that are characteristically found in ATPases and are distantly related to the ATPase domain of several poxvirus proteins(27Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 291-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A recombinant SNF2/SWI2 fusion protein has been shown to possess DNA-dependent ATPase activity in vitro(28Laurent B. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which is important for both its effects on transcription in vivo(28Laurent B. Treich I. Carlson M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) as well as for its ability to disrupt nucleosomes in vitro(16Cote J. Quinn J. Workman J.L. Peterson C.L. Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 17Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). By contrast, the yeast Mot1 protein behaves as a DNA-independent ATPase in vitro(19Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G.F. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The mechanism of repression of basal transcription by Mot1 is not tightly coupled to chromatin structure, rather, the protein acts to displace the TATA-binding protein from RNA polymerase II promoters in an ATP-dependent manner and can repress transcription in vitro on naked promoter DNAs(19Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G.F. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These two examples suggest that the different SNF2/SWI2-related proteins may affect cellular processes in distinct ways, through mechanisms that share in common a requirement for ATP hydrolysis.By screening a HeLa expression library with sequences from the initiator region of the HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIVhuman immunodeficiency viruskbkilobase pair(s)DTTdithiothreitolPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisORFopen reading framebpbase pair(s). promoter, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a new member of the SNF2/SWI2 family of proteins. The encoded protein (called HIP116) was also found to bind specifically to the SPH (I + II) motifs of the SV40 enhancer. Both of these binding sites are known to be recognized by other transcription factors; e.g. the SPH repeats are bound by TEF-1 transcription factor in non-lymphoid cells(29Davidson I. Xiao J. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and by the Oct proteins in B lymphocytes(30Sturm R. Baumruker T. Franza Jr, B. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 31Sturm R. Das G. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), similarly, this region of the HIV-1 promoter is recognized by LBP-1/CP2, TBP, and TFII-I (for reviews, see (32Gaynor R. J. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and (33Jones K.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antiserum to HIP116 was used to identify the native HIP116 protein in HeLa nuclear extracts, and the protein was purified by DNA affinity chromatography. We show here that HIP116 binds independently of TEF-1 to the SPH repeats of the SV40 enhancer, and, similarly, that it binds independently of LBP-1 to HIV-1 promoter. In addition, we find that the HeLa HIP116 protein is a DNA-dependent ATPase and that this activity is strongly stimulated by SV40 enhancer DNA and can be inhibited with anti-HIP116 antiserum. These findings suggest that HIP116 could affect transcription by acting as a DNA binding site-specific ATPase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of the HIP116 cDNA by Expression ScreeningThe HIP cDNA was isolated by screening an amplified γgt-11 cDNA expression library according to the procedure described by Vinson et al.(34Vinson C. LaMarco K. Johnson P. Landschultz W. McKnight S. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The library was derived from poly(A)-selected RNA prepared from phorbol-ester treated HeLa cells and contained 6 × 105 independent clones. The HIV-1 DNA oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-GCCTGTACTGGGTGGCCATGGTTAGACCAGATC-3′ and 5′-TGGTCTAACCATGGCCACCCAGTACAGGCGATC-3′) were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, purified on native gels, and ligated prior to use as a probe for hybridization to the filters. The specific activity of the DNA probe was 2 × 108 cpm/μg, and hybridizations contained 8 × 106 cpm/filter (150-mm filter), each containing a total of approximately 20,000 plaques. The first cDNA clone that was isolated (called 1.3KB/HIP) was subsequently used as a probe to isolate longer cDNAs of 1.5 kb and 2.7 kb from a cDNA library prepared from Jurkat RNA (35Waterman M.L. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 656-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). All cDNAs were sequenced in their entirety from both DNA strands using the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method.Expression of a trpE/HIP Fusion Protein in Escherichia coliTo obtain recombinant HIP protein for raising antisera, the entire 1.3KB/HIP cDNA was subcloned in frame to the E. colitrpE gene in a bacterial expression vector. Bacterial cell cultures (500 ml) were induced as described by Angel et al.(36Angel P. Smeal T. Meek J. Karin M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 35-43PubMed Google Scholar), pelleted at 6000 × g for 10 min, and suspended in 1.3 ml of buffer R: 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 25% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mM sodium metabisulfite. The bacterial pellets were lysed by incubation with 0.5 mg of lysozyme at 4°C for 1 h, and the extract was treated with volume of 10 M urea for 30 min at 37°C to solubilize the fusion protein. The mixture was centrifuged at 63,000 × g for 1 h to pellet insoluble proteins, and the supernatant was dialyzed for 2 h against 200 ml of TM 0.1M buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 M KCl) containing 1 M urea and then overnight against TM 0.1M buffer without urea. The recombinant trpE/HIP protein was used to generate antisera (Fig. 4) and assayed for binding activity DNase I footprint experiments (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Binding of recombinant HIP116 and AP-1 proteins to the SV40 enhancer as analyzed by DNase I footprint experiments. A, binding of recombinant HIP116 to the HIV-1 promoter is shown in the panel on the left. Reactions containing trpE/HIP116 or LBP-1 are indicated above each lane, and the DNA sequence in the TATA/initiator region of the HIV-1 promoter bound by HIP116 (−33 to +3) is shown to the right of the gel. DNA sequence markers are shown in lane G; control bacterial cell extract (uninduced) was added to the reaction in lane marked None; 100 ng of purified HeLa LBP-1 protein was added to lane marked LBP-1; and 10 and 25 μg of bacterial extracted expressing trpE/HIP were added to lanes 3 and 4, respectively, which are marked rHIP. B, binding of recombinant HIP116 to the 72-bp repeats of the SV40 enhancer. Reactions in lanes 1 and 4 contained 25 μg of control (uninduced) bacterial cell extract, and the other reactions included 25 μg of bacterial extract containing the trpE/HIP116 fusion protein (lane 2) or 25 μg of bacterial extract containing a trpE/c-jun fusion protein, which binds to the P motifs of the SV40 enhancer. The HIP116 binding sites on the SV40 enhancer are indicated with brackets, and a single binding site sequence is shown alongside the footprint.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Generation of Rabbit Polyclonal AntiserumTo generate antibodies specific to HIP116, the recombinant trpE/HIP fusion protein was isolated as a gel slice from a preparative SDS-PAGE, emulsified into Freund's adjuvant, and injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. Initial injections contained 200 and 100 μg of trpE/HIP, respectively, followed by subsequent injections of 25-50 μg of soluble trpE/HIP fusion protein, which had been eluted from a gel into Laemmli buffer, denatured in 6 M guanidine HCl, and renatured by exhaustive dialysis into TM 0.1M and then 1 × phosphate buffer saline solution. Preimmune serum obtained before the first injection served as a control for the specificity of the antisera. To purify the antibodies prior to their use in gel shift experiments, a portion of the crude antisera was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7, and centrifuged at 35,000 × g to remove insoluble protein. The samples were filtered and passed over a protein G-Superose column (HR 16/5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and the bound IgG was eluted with 100 mM glycine HCl buffer, pH 2.7, and subsequently adjusted to neutral pH. The purified antiserum was required for gel shift and immunoprecipitation assays, whereas crude or IgG-purified antisera were found to be equally useful for Western immunoblot experiments.Preparation of [35S]Methionine-labeled HeLa Cell Extracts and ImmunoprecipitationsTo identify HIP116 protein in extracts from HeLa cells, a 100-mm plate of exponentially growing HeLa-TK(-) cells (1-2 × 107 cells) was washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated at 37°C in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 15 min. 70 μl of [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN, 12 μCi/μl) was added to the media, and the cells were incubated for 2 h. The cells were then washed twice with Tris-buffered saline solution and incubated for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 0.01% aprotonin, 50 μM leupeptin, pH 7.5). The cells were then passed through a 20-gauge needle several times, mixed with 100 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was adjusted to a volume of 1.5 ml, and a 500-μl aliquot was incubated with 3 μl of the crude preimmune or immune HIP116 antibodies for 2 h at 4°C. For the blocking reaction, 1 μg of purified recombinant trpE/HIP protein was preincubated with antibody prior to the immunoprecipitation step. 40 μl of protein A beads (Pharmacia; beads were used as a 1:1 suspension with radioimmune precipitation buffer) was added and the protein/antibody/beads slurry was rotated at 4°C for 1 h. The beads were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was removed using a 18-gauge needle. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the pelleted beads were resuspended in sample buffer (120 mM Tris, 1% SDS, 500 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), boiled for 3 min, and loaded directly onto an SDS-PAGE.SDS-PAGE and Southwestern Blotting ExperimentsFor Western blot experiments, the proteins present in immunoprecipitates from HeLa nuclear extracts were treated with either preimmune or immune sera, resuspended and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed on an 8% gel (SDS-PAGE). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.45-μm filters) using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer apparatus operating at 1 mA/cm2 for 90 min. Nonspecific sites on the nitrocellulose were blocked with wash buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 9% powdered milk, for 60 min at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was then incubated overnight at 4°C with a solution containing a 1:500 dilution of crude HIP116 antibodies in wash buffer plus 5% milk, washed, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a 1:1000 dilution of horseradish-peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy and light chain specific, Cappel). The nitrocellulose filter was washed, equilibrated in substrate buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubation with substrate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml 4-chloro-1-napthol in 15% (v/v) methanol and 0.025% (v/v) H2O2.For SouthWestern blots, the transferred proteins were denatured by incubation of the filter in Z′ buffer (25 mM HEPES, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) containing 50 mM KCl and 6 M guanidine HCl, for 5 min at room temperature. The nitrocellulose filter was then incubated with Z′ 0.05M buffer to renature the proteins, followed by incubation with Z′ 0.05M buffer containing 5% milk at room temperature for 5 min. The filter was washed with Z′ 0.05M and placed in hybridization solution (Z′ 0.05M, 2 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 3 × 106 cpm/ml of labeled DNA) containing the [32P] end-labeled HIV-1 DNA, and incubated overnight at 4°C. The filter was then washed with an excess of Z′ 0.05M buffer at room temperature prior to autoradiography.Purification of HIP116 from HeLa Cell Nuclear ExtractsNuclear extracts prepared from 72 liters (4 × 1010 cells) of HeLa S-3 spinner cells were pooled, desalted on an 800-ml P-10 column (medium grade, Bio-Rad), and fractionated over a 20-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman; P-11) column in HEPES buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT) containing 100 mM KCl (H 0.1 M buffer). The column was washed with H 0.1M buffer and eluted with a salt gradient from 100 to 600 mM KCl followed by a 1 M step fraction. 1.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed directly for DNA binding activity in gel mobility shift experiments. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed into TM 0.1M buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl) and passed over an 8-ml heparin-agarose column. The column washed with 2 column volumes of Z′ 0.1M (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT), and bound proteins were eluted with a 100-600 mM KCl gradient followed by a Z′ 1.0M step fraction. The fractions were assayed for DNA binding activity or for HIP116 protein directly by gel shift and Western immunoblot assays, respectively.Fractions containing HIP116 activity were pooled, dialyzed into Z′ 0.1M buffer, and passed over DNA affinity resins containing multimerized copies of either the SV40 SPH DNA (used for the first pass) or the HIV-1 initiator DNA (used on the second and third pass DNA affinity columns). The columns were washed with Z′ 0.1M, and bound proteins were eluted with four successive steps of Z′ 1.0M buffer. Fractions were assayed for HIP116 protein by SDS-PAGE, DNA binding activity, and Western blot experiments. For DNA affinity chromatography, the HIP116 fraction was incubated for 10 min on ice (with 15 and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), for first and subsequent affinity column runs, respectively) before loading on the resins. In some cases, carbonic anhydrase was added (final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl) to the affinity-purified HIP116 fractions to stabilize its activity, although it was subsequently determined that this was not required. All column buffers included the following protease inhibitors: PMSF (0.1 mM), benzamidine (2 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), aprotonin (10 μg/ml), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml).Expression and Purification of His(6)/HIP from Recombinant Baculovirus-infected Sf9 CellsThe expression construct His(6)/HIP, containing a histidine tag at the amino terminus of the full-length HIP116 protein, was constructed by isolating the Asp718-HindIII fragment from the vector pGEMEX/3.2KBHIP, blunting the fragment by treatment with Klenow enzyme, and inserting it into a blunted NcoI site and the HindIII site of the baculovirus recombination vector pBlueBacHis-C (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus, called His(6)/HIP, was isolated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with linearized wild type AcMNPV and the His(6)/HIP construct using the cationic liposome transfection method (Invitrogen) and plaque-purified through three rounds. The recombinant protein His/HIP116 protein was isolated from a whole cell extract of Sf9 insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus for 3 days at 27°C. The recombinant protein was purified using the Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) without addition of DTT. Specifically, 40 ml of whole cell extract was isolated from 109 infected cells and passed over a 0.5-ml Ni2+ column. The column was washed sequentially with buffer D (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 17% glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 10 mM sodium fluoride) containing 0.8 and 8 mM imidizole and eluted with successive steps of buffer D containing 40, 80, or 300 mM imidazole. The purity of the His(6)/HIP protein was determined by SDS-PAGE with silver staining and immunoblot assays, and purified fractions were concentrated by binding to a 0.5-ml heparin-agarose column, eluted with TM 0.4M and dialyzed into TM 0.1M buffer before use in gel shift assays (Fig. 8).Figure 8:Binding of HIP116 and TEF-1 to the SV40 enhancer SPH motifs.

The reactions were prepared on ice, and 4-μg aliquots of the individual phosphocellulose column fractions were added. The reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min, mixed with 3 μl of dye buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol), and loaded directly onto a 4 or 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 × TBE, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol. The gels were run at 14 V/cm at room temperature for 90 min. DNA affinity-purified fractions of HIP116 or TEF-1 contained 25-50 ng of protein, and no competitor DNA was added. For the supershift experiments with the various antibodies, the binding reactions were incubated for 10 min on ice prior to adding 2 μl (0.1 μg) of HIP116 or control hLEF antiserum. The reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice before loading on the gel. For the DNA competition experiments, the unlabeled competitor DNAs were added to the reaction mix before the protein.

https://openalex.org/W2087059664,"The incorporation of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex, factor Xa-factor Va-phospholipid-Ca(II), results in an approximately 10<sup>5</sup>-fold higher rate of substrate activation than that of the enzyme alone. To examine the role of the prothrombin kringle domains in the interaction with prothrombinase we have employed site-directed mutagenesis to produce prothrombin species that lack either the first kringle domain, PT/ΔK1, or the second kringle domain, PT/ΔK2. Previously, we have shown that these proteins are fully carboxylated and that they bind to phospholipid vesicles. In this investigation we demonstrate that cleavage at Arg<sup>271</sup>-Thr<sup>272</sup> and Arg<sup>320</sup>-Ile<sup>321</sup> peptide bonds occurs upon activation with prothrombinase to yield normal thrombin from both PT/ΔK1 and PT/ΔK2. In the absence of factor Va, the <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>(app) for the activation of PT/ΔK1, PT/ΔK2, or plasma-derived prothrombin by factor Xa-phospholipid-Ca(II) are equivalent. The <i>K</i><sub>m</sub>(app) for the activation of PT/ΔK2 by prothrombinase is approximately 4-5-fold higher than that obtained for plasma-derived prothrombin or PT/ΔK1. These data demonstrate that the prothrombin kringle domains do not contribute significantly to the binding affinity of the substrate-enzyme interaction. In the absence of factor Va, equivalent <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values were obtained for all of the prothrombin species when they were activated by factor Xa-Ca(II)-phospholipid. In contrast, a 7-fold lower <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> value was obtained for the activation of PT/ΔK2 by prothrombinase as compared with that obtained for plasma prothrombin or PT/ΔK1. Collectively, these data suggest that determinants within the second prothrombin kringle domain interact with factor Va to elicit a significant acceleration in the catalytic rate of substrate turnover. Indeed, in contrast to plasma-derived prothrombin, no direct binding of PT/ΔK2 to factor Va to form the PT/ΔK2factor Va complex could be demonstrated by 90° light scattering."

The gene, located at 66D14, spans over 12.8 kilobases (kb) and is organized into 10 exons, 9 of which code for the paramyosin transcripts. An exon, located between exons 7 and 8, codes for the 5′-end of the miniparamyosin, and the two proteins share the two last exons of the gene.

The regulated expression of the muscle proteins is the main characteristic of myogenesis. Differentiation of a specific muscle type is achieved by a combination of mechanisms including the expression of distinct muscle proteins (1Vigoreaux J.O. Saide J.D. Valgeirsdottir K. Pardue M.L. J.

However, the functional significance of expressing specific isoforms in different muscles remains an unsolved issue. The identification of the different components of Drosophila thick filaments is a necessary step in exploiting the advantages of Drosophila for studies of muscle structure and function(4Fyrberg E.

The understanding of how assembly of thick filaments in the muscle fibers takes place, the molecular mechanisms involved, and the specific roles of each thick filament component remain to be clarified.

Mutant analysis indicates that interaction of myosin with paramyosin and maintenance of the proper stoichiometry of both proteins are also necessary for assembly and determination of the thick filament length(21Waterston R.H.

The flight musculature, a distinct insect muscle type, has been one of the experimental systems where, at least historically, the structure and organization of the contractile tissues has been analyzed(26Smith D.S. King R.C. Akai H. Insect Ultrastructure. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984: 111-150Crossref Google Scholar). D. melanogaster paramyosin was identified and cloned in our laboratory(10Vinós J. Maroto M. Garesse R. Marco R. Cervera M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), where it was shown that it has a similar sequence and molecular weight similar to those of other invertebrate paramyosins. Drosophila paramyosin was especially abundant in non-fibrillar musculature and relatively less abundant in the fibrillar indirect flight muscles(11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of approximately the same molecular mass of about 107 kDa were identified in Drosophila(11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More recently, through the identification of a cDNA, miniparamyosin, a distinct paramyosin isoform of lower molecular weight was described in Drosophila. Miniparamyosin, an isoform not previously identified in any invertebrate system, was described as exclusively present in certain types of muscles in the adult fly(27Becker K.D. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The role of different forms of paramyosin in regulating the properties and complex phenomenology of the thick filaments in invertebrate muscles made it interesting to study in more detail. In this article, we present the genomic clones that code for the complete sequence of paramyosin and miniparamyosin together with their intron/exon structure. The evidence supports the idea that all isoforms are coded in D. melanogaster by a single gene. Nevertheless, paramyosin and miniparamyosin are regulated from different promoter sequences located several kilobases apart. Their transcription initiation sites and the nucleotide sequence of the promoters have been determined. The analysis of these sequences has shown the existence of several putative regulatory sites, some of which are consensus binding sites for muscle-specific transcription factors. Furthermore, by producing antibodies specific for the paramyosin and miniparamyosin isoforms we have been able to show that miniparamyosin is widely distributed among phylogenetically distant invertebrates. The genomic DNA library (λ DASH) was screened following a standard protocol(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Positive clones were purified and subcloned into pBluescript II. Clones were mapped for positions of restriction endonuclease cleavage and by Southern analysis with paramyosin cDNA probes and oligonucleotides derived from the paramyosin and miniparamyosin cDNA sequences(10Vinós J.

Based on the paramyosin and miniparamyosin cDNA sequences, several oligonucleotides covering distinct regions of the cDNAs were synthesized and used as primers. PCR fragments were amplified through 30 cycles (94°C/1 min, 50°C/1 min, 72°C/1 min) using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Primer extensions were conducted basically as described by Heberlein(30Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar). The primers used were as follows: 5′-P3 (5′-TTC GCG TAT CTA GTA TTA TGA TTT GTG TGT-3′) and 5′-P1 (5′-CTA TAC AGC ACC GCA CGC AG-3′) complementary to nucleotides 107-136 and 70-89, respectively, of the paramyosin cDNA sequence; and mP5 (5′-CTG CAA TAT CTT AAG AGT GTC GCG TTT GAT-3′) and mP6 (5′-TCT TGT CGA GTT CGT TAT CCA ATT CAA TC-3′) complementary to nucleotides 69-98 and 109-138, respectively, of the miniparamyosin cDNA sequence. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and annealed at 60°C for 90 min with 100 μg of total RNA from late pupae (200-210 h). The annealed primers were extended with 10 units of reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) at 42°C for 90 min. The same primers were used on cloned genomic DNA templates to generate dideoxy sequencing ladders that were compared with the extension products of the primers to determine the paramyosin and miniparamyosin transcription initiation sites. The primer extensions were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. Assays were carried out as described previously(31Gil I. Gallego M.E. Renart J. Cruces J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6007-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the paramyosin assay, a 665-bp genomic fragment was amplified by PCR with the primers 5P (5′-CTT ATA TGT ATG TCA GTT CGA-3′) and 5′-P3 (described above). In the miniparamyosin assay, the 642-bp genomic PCR fragment was amplified using the primers 5mP (5′-CTG CCA CTG CTG CCA ACC GAG-3′) and mP5 (described above). Three antibodies were prepared. One of the antibodies was made against the polypeptide encoded by a specific exon of the paramyosin (exon 5), and the other two antibodies were raised against the polypeptide encoded by exon 1B, the specific exon of miniparamyosin. A 594-bp PCR fragment from exon 5 of the paramyosin (corresponding to nucleotides 1271-678 of the paramyosin cDNA) was cloned into the expression plasmid pT7-7. Following induction with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, a 198-amino acid polypeptide (23.2 kDa) was obtained, and inclusion bodies were purified. A 309-bp PCR fragment from exon 1B of miniparamyosin (corresponding to nucleotides 123-431 of the miniparamyosin cDNA) coding for a 103-amino acid polypeptide (11.7 kDa) was cloned in two different plasmids: pUEX3 and pMALc. The fusion proteins of 128.5 kDa and 53.5 kDa, respectively, were synthesized after induction, and inclusion bodies were purified. The three polypeptides were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and cut from the gels, and the bands were used to immunize the rabbits(32Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Specific antibodies against the polypeptide expressed by exon 1B were obtained by affinity purification (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antisera corresponding to each miniparamyosin fusion protein were purified by adsorption with the other miniparamyosin fusion protein immobilized on strips of nitrocellulose. The specificity of the three antibodies was tested. They recognized only one band, paramyosin or miniparamyosin, as expected, by Western blot in thorax samples (data not shown). The two miniparamyosin antibodies recognized the protein with the same specificity and intensity. Since the titer was higher, this work was done using the antibody obtained with the pUEX3 construct. The three antibodies gave a similar sarcomeric band pattern by immunofluorescence analysis with isolated Drosophila muscle fibers. Dissected muscles or whole animals were homogenized in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 140 mM ClNa, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml antipain. Insoluble cytoskeletal protein samples from various stages of Drosophila development were prepared as described previously (11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were done as described previously(11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amount of protein loaded in each lane was about 20 μg. After screening of a λ DASH genomic library using paramyosin cDNA probes from the 5′, 3′, and middle region of the gene (see “Materials and Methods”), three different genomic clones were isolated. The positives clones, containing inserts of 16, 17, and 17.5 kb, were analyzed. All clones share the same restriction sites in the overlapping regions and cover a region of 25 kb (Fig. 1a). The genomic DNA clones were partially sequenced, and it was found that the gene spans 12.8 kb and comprises 10 exons and 9 introns (Fig. 1a). Paramyosin is coded by 9 exons, all except exon 1B. This exon, located in an intron following exon 7 of paramyosin, codes for the 5′-end of miniparamyosin. Thus, the paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene codes for two proteins that share the two last exons, 8 and 9, of the gene. Furthermore (Fig. 1b), the positions of the intron-exon boundaries were defined precisely. The donor and acceptor splice sites correlate with the splice junction consensus for Drosophila(33Mount S.M. Burks C. Hertz G. Stormo G.D. White O. Fields C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4255-4262Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Paramyosin and miniparamyosin present at least two transcripts each, differing in the choice of alternative polyadenylation sites(10Vinós J. Maroto M. Garesse R. Marco R. Cervera M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Becker K.D. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 5′-ends of the paramyosin and miniparamyosin transcripts were mapped by primer extension analysis and nuclease S1 protection assays (Fig. 2). Assays were performed with total late pupae RNA because both the paramyosin and miniparamyosin transcripts are present at this developmental stage(10Vinós J. Maroto M. Garesse R. Marco R. Cervera M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Becker K.D. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The results in both assays indicate the existence of two transcription initiation sites for paramyosin mRNA, with the main one corresponding to the already published cDNA sequence. Slightly longer cDNAs with sequences corresponding to the minor site of transcription initiation at nucleotides (−35 to −37) have not yet been identified (10Vinós J. Maroto M. Garesse R. Marco R. Cervera M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Becker K.D. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, only one transcription start site for miniparamyosin has been detected. According to the mapping of the 5′-end of the miniparamyosin mRNAs (Fig. 2, a and b), this transcription start site is located 45 bp upstream of the published cDNA sequence (Fig. 2c). In an effort to identify conserved sequences that may also serve a regulatory function, we have cloned and sequenced the 5′-flanking regions of the paramyosin and miniparamyosin transcriptional initiation sites in D. melanogaster and Drosophila virilis. These two Drosophilidae species diverged more than 50 million years ago and therefore are useful to detect evolutionarily conserved regulatory features. In Fig. 3, the nucleotide sequences of the regions extending about 350 and 450 nucleotides for paramyosin and miniparamyosin, respectively, upstream of the main transcription initiation sites are presented. The nucleotide sequences reveal a number of potential regulatory elements (boxed or underlined in Fig. 3). The comparison with the homologous D. virilis sequences allows the preliminary identification of the functionally significant features in the sequence (boxed in Fig. 3). The pentanucleotide TCAGT, a consensus sequence for the eucaryotic promoter cap site (34Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) and for the regulatory initiator element(35Purnell B.A. Emanuel P.A. Gilmour D.S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), is present in the sequenced paramyosin and miniparamyosin transcriptional initiation sites. It is highly conserved between the two Drosophilidae and provides support for the likelihood of a functional role of these motifs. Furthermore, paramyosin and miniparamyosin proximal promoters in D. melanogaster show AT-rich regions between −25 and −40 from the main transcriptional initiation sites. Interestingly, the comparison with the D. virilis sequences suggests distinct roles for these putative TATA boxes. Whereas the AT-rich region of the paramyosin promoter is exactly conserved in D. virilis, validating the likelihood of it serving as a functional element, the corresponding region of the miniparamyosin promoter is not conserved in D. virilis. In addition, the CG and CCAAT elements, found to be critical in numerous eucaryotic promoters, were also detected. The paramyosin proximal promoter has a putative CCAAT element at position −45 that could be recognized by CCAAT transcriptional factors (36Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and is conserved in the two Drosophilidae species. An equivalent CCAAT element is not found in the miniparamyosin promoter. Instead, several GC boxes that could bind the general transcriptional factor Sp1 (37Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) are present at positions −45 and −52 in both Drosophilidae miniparamyosin promoters. Even though two GC boxes at −121 and −136 are present in the paramyosin promoter, they are not conserved in the D. virilis sequence, which suggests they have no functional role. Similarly, the GC element present at −113 in the miniparamyosin promoter is also absent in the D. virilis sequence. Therefore, in spite of being present in both D. melanogaster promoters, it is doubtful that these GC boxes contribute to the regulation of these proteins. The possibility of identifying cis-acting DNA elements responsible for muscle-specific transcription of the paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene was also examined. The analysis of the currently available sequence in the two Drosophilidae species reveals the conservation of several E-boxes in both promoters. The sequence CANNTG, or E-box, has been proposed as the consensus binding site of muscle-specific transcription factors of the MyoD family(38Olson E.N. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1454-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The paramyosin promoter has only one conserved E-box at −263, and the miniparamyosin sequence has two E-boxes, at −59 and −152, all numbered from the transcription initiation sites. On the other hand, two E-boxes at −61 and at −296 in the D. melanogaster paramyosin promoter are not conserved in D. virilis; neither is the E-box at −417 in the miniparamyosin promoter. To confirm that the two proteins are independently expressed in Drosophila, the developmental time course of the miniparamyosin expression was determined by Western analysis using the specific antibody against miniparamyosin produced in our laboratory (see “Materials and Methods”). Miniparamyosin was first detected in third instar larvae (90-100 h of development), and its levels decreased during early pupal stages. In late pupae (170-180 h of development), the levels increased progressively, reaching maximal levels at adulthood. Western analysis of thorax samples from 20-, 30-, and 45-day-old flies indicates that the amount of miniparamyosin remains constant during aging (data not shown). In contrast, paramyosin was detected at approximately 10-12 h of embryonic development and remained relatively constant. The amount of paramyosin decreases only slightly at pupal stages, in contrast to the levels of mRNA(10Vinós J. Maroto M. Garesse R. Marco R. Cervera M. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 27Becker K.D. O'Donnell P.T. Heitz J.M. Vito M. Bernstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 669-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The only paramyosin gene for which the detailed sequence is known is in C. elegans(39Kagawa H. Gengyo K. McLachlan A.D. Brenner S. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4, conservation of the exon and intron organization of the two paramyosin genes is very limited. Only two exons (namely, exons 2 and 3 of D. melanogaster that correspond to exons 3 and 4 of the nematode) are conserved and share the same splice sites. In addition, exon 4 of D. melanogaster corresponds to exons 5 and 6 in C. elegans. It is noteworthy that the sequence of exon 1B, the specific exon of the miniparamyosin, is not present in any region (exons or introns) of the C. elegans paramyosin gene sequence. In fact, exon 7 and 8 of the D. melanogaster paramyosin gene, the flanking exons of exon 1B, are linked in the same exon of the C. elegans paramyosin gene (Fig. 4). Thus, in contrast to paramyosin, either miniparamyosin is not generally expressed in invertebrates or it is transcribed from a still unidentified gene in C. elegans. To explore this alternative, we have used the polyclonal antibodies against specific regions of paramyosin/miniparamyosin gene (see “Materials and Methods”). The presence of a similar cross-reactive protein was investigated by immunoblotting analysis of extract from several representative members of different invertebrate phyla (namely, Diptera (D. melanogaster, D. virilis, and Calliphora), Hymenoptera (Formica), Coleoptera (Coccinella), Orthoptera (Locusta and Blatta), and a member of the Apterygota, the silverfish (Lepisma)) and from representative members of other arthropod classes (Arachnida (Araneus), Crustacea (Astacus) and Chilopoda (Scalopendra)). In parallel, muscle extracts from additional representative protostome invertebrates were also processed and tested (namely, Mollusca (Mytilus and Helix), Annelida (Lumbricus), and Nematoda (Caenorhabditis)). In addition, muscles from a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea urchin Sphaerochinus, and a mammal, Rattus, are included. In Fig. 5, Western blots made with three different antibodies (namely, anti-miniparamyosin (anti-exon 1B), anti-paramyosin (an antibody made against the purified protein(11Vinós J. Domingo A. Marco R. Cervera M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 687-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and anti-exon 5 antiserum (specific to paramyosin in D. melanogaster) are presented (see “Materials and Methods”). The miniparamyosin antiserum recognizes a protein of lower molecular mass than paramyosin (50-80 kDa) in all preparations except those from Caenorhabditis and Rattus. Interestingly, the miniparamyosin polyclonal antibody also cross-reacts with paramyosin in all the analyzed species except in Diptera (the two Drosophilae species and Calliphora) and Caenorhabditis (Fig. 5b). In Fig. 5c, the reaction with the antiparamyosin antibody made against the purified protein (11Vinós J"

In mammals, these receptors regulate processes ranging from chemotaxis to synaptic signaling and vasoconstriction. Their ligands likewise range from glycoproteins to biogenic amines and lipid molecules (reviewed in (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein cAMP receptor 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline. Despite this heterogeneity of function and ligand structure, occupancy of these receptors elicits an apparently conserved series of activation and desensitization processes. Initially, occupancy causes the activation of receptor-associated G-proteins, which, in turn, stimulate such effectors as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, and ion channels (reviewed in (2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, at least two different desensitization events, adaptation and “loss” of ligand binding, are observed. While most studies of these processes focused on the β-adrenergic receptor (reviewed in (3Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), similar observations have been made for other G-protein-coupled receptors. Adaptation, a rapid reduction in agonist-induced effector activation, has been attributed to the uncoupling of receptor from G-protein. This uncoupling is proposed to result from agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation and the subsequent association of arrestin, which appears to obstruct further receptor-G-protein interaction. The second agonist-induced desensitization process is a rapid reduction in the apparent number of surface binding sites. In some instances, this loss of ligand binding, often referred to as sequestration, has been attributed to receptor endocytosis. Dictyostelium utilizes a family of four cell-surface G-protein-coupled cAMP receptors (cARs) to mediate a transition from a unicellular amoeboid phase to a multicellular sporogenous phase upon nutrient depletion. One of these, cAR1, is expressed shortly after the initiation of starvation and is required for aggregation(5Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the growth stage when the endogenous receptor gene is not expressed. This property has been exploited for the study of cAR1 mutants resulting in the identification of the major sites of cAMP-stimulated cAR1 phosphorylation(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used this system to examine the mechanism of cAMP-induced loss of ligand binding. Our findings lead us to conclude that, following cAMP pretreatment, growth-stage cells overexpressing cAR1 exhibit reduced binding, not because of receptor internalization, but because of a reduction in the affinity of cAR1 for cAMP. We also demonstrate that this transition is defective in cAR1 mutants that lack targets of ligand-stimulated phosphorylation, suggesting a possible link between these processes. AX-3 cells were grown in shaking culture in HL-5(17Watts D. Ashworth J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Transformed cell cultures were supplemented with G418 (20 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells maintained on Petri dishes were grown in suspension for at least 2 days prior to each experiment. Harvested cells were washed once in PB (5 mM Na2HPO4, 5 mM KH2PO4, pH 6.1), and resuspended in ice-cold PB. Development in shaking culture with 50 nM cAMP pulses was initiated as described(18Devreotes P.N. Fontana D. Klein P. Sherring J. Theibert A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 299-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Met1 and Gly2 of cAR1 were replaced with a human c-Myc epitope(19Evan G.J. Lewis G.K. Ramsey G. Bishop M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar), MAEEQKLISEEDL, by polymerase chain reaction. The final nucleotideotide sequence was as follows: 5′GATCCAAAATAAA ATG GCT GAA GAA CAA AAA TTA ATT TCA GAA GAT CTT … 3′, where the last codon originates from codon 3 in the cAR1 cDNA(5Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1988; 241: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The resulting 1.3-kilobase pair fragment was subcloned into the BglII site of pBS18 (5Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1988; 241: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) to yield pMC8. pMC36 (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express wild-type cAR1. Both plasmids were electroporated into growth-stage Dictyostelium cells and transformants selected using G418 as described(20Dynes J.L. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Washed cells were resuspended to 108/ml in PB and [3H]cAMP binding measured using either a sedimentation assay (21Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or a silicone oil assay(22Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as indicated in the figure legends. Unless otherwise indicated, loss of ligand binding was induced with 10-5M cAMP in the presence of 10 mM dithiothreitol (to inhibit endogenous phosphodiesterase; (23Brenner M. Thomas S. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and measured as described previously(16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also unless otherwise indicated, a subsaturating cAMP concentration of 10 nM was used in the loss of binding experiments in order to allow a sensitive detection of binding affinity changes. For the concentration dependence experiment and for the experiment involving developed cells, 5 mM caffeine was included in the incubation to prevent the production of endogenous cAMP(24Henderson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4730-4736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the analysis of cAMP binding parameters, [3H]cAMP binding at concentrations ranging from 10-9M to 2 × 10-6M was measured using the silicone oil assay and analyzed using the program LIGAND(48Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). Uptake of radiolabeled cAMP was measured as described previously(16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Washed cells (2 × 107) were shaken 15 min at 22°C in 300 μl of PB containing 1 nM or 10 nM [3H]cAMP, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and unlabeled cAMP (0-2000 nM). Nonspecific uptake was measured in the presence of 10-4M unlabeled cAMP. Uptake was halted by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold PB containing 10-4M unlabeled cAMP, centrifugation (4 min, 2000 rpm, Sorvall HS-4 rotor), and three 3-ml washes with PB. Such extensive washing has been shown to remove all receptor-associated cAMP (25Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Devreotes P.N. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 897-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets were solubilized in 200 μl of 0.1 M formic acid, 4 ml of scintillation fluid was added, and radioactivity assessed. In control experiments, cells lacking cAR1 (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed virtually no cAMP uptake, even at the highest concentrations. Washed cells at 3 × 107/ml were shaken for 5 min at 0°C. L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (50 μg/ml, Worthington) was added for 0-15 min, followed by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml, Worthington) and two washes with 10 volumes of ice-cold PB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (4 min, 2000 rpm, Sorvall SS34 rotor). Pellets were washed once in 5 ml of ERB containing 1.5% CHAPS(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), once in ERB, and resuspended to 108/ml in sample buffer(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). Control experiments indicated that all detectable tryptic activity was removed during the washes. The human c-Myc peptide (AEEQKLISEEDLLRKRREQLKHKLEQLRNSCA, Oncogene Science) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described(27Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1982; 28: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and injected subcutaneously into a rabbit. High-titer serum was obtained within six weeks of the initial injection. Whole cells or the CHAPS-insoluble fraction, solubilized in sample buffer(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205463) Google Scholar), were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% low-bis polyacrylamide gels(28Klein P. Theibert A. Fontana D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1757-1764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated as described (28Klein P. Theibert A. Fontana D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1757-1764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with cAR1 COOH terminus-specific antiserum (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-c-Myc (1:1000). Proteins were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated to donkey anti-rabbit-IgG antibodies (Sigma) and chemiluminescence. Quantitation of scans was performed using a digitizing scanner (Logitech) and Sigmascan Image software (Jandel). Washed cells (5 × 107/ml) were rapidly fixed in suspension with methanol, 1% formaldehyde (−10°C, 15 min). Fixed cells were then pelleted (2000 rpm, 4 min, IEC rotor), washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 8 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM K2HPO4, 0.8% NaCl, pH 7.4), incubated in PBS containing cAR1 antiserum (1:1000, 60 min; (29Klein P. Vaughan R. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed four times in PBS, incubated 60 min in goat anti-rabbit fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (Cappel, Durham, NC), washed four times with PBS, and mounted on glass slides with mounting medium (PBS containing 90% glycerol and 1 mg/ml phenylenediamine, pH 8.5). Specimens were photographed using a Leitz Ortholux II fluorescence microscope. Antisera were preadsorbed with methanol-fixed vegetative AX-3 cells prior to use. We first characterized this process in growth-stage AX-3 cells expressing high levels (1-5 × 105 sites/cell) of exogenous cAR1 from a constitutive promotor. Cells were treated with cAMP, washed extensively, and residual cAMP binding examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment with 10 μM cAMP induced a rapid (t½ = 1.5-2 min) 80% reduction in 10 nM [3H]cAMP binding. While 1 nM cAMP elicited a detectable loss, 10 μM was required to elicit the full effect (Fig. 1B). The EC50 of this response was 25 nM. These results for overexpressed cAR1 in growth-stage cells are similar to those reported for endogenous cAR1 in developed AX-3 cells (t½ = 2-3 min, EC50 = 50 nM; (13Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7700-7704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the same process is occurring at these two developmental stages. Moreover, these properties are attributable to cAR1, since vector-transformed cells lacking cAR1 (pMC34/JB4; (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) exhibit less than 1% of the cAMP binding capacity described above (data not shown). Scatchard analyses were undertaken in order to elucidate the basis of the reduced binding observed in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 2A, untreated growth-stage cells exhibit a curvilinear cAMP binding profile. Computer-generated fits of these data (Table 1, experiments 1 and 2) reveal both low and high affinity classes of binding sites with affinities consistent with those reported previously(46Johnson R.L. Van Haastert P.J.M. Kimmel A.R. Jastorff B. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4600-4607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon pretreatment with cAMP, the Scatchard plot remains curvilinear but appears more shallow than that of control cells (Fig. 2A). This change reflects the fact that cAMP induces a 70-80% reduction of binding when measured at 10 nM cAMP (as in Fig. 1) but only a 40% reduction of binding when measured at 2 μM cAMP (rightmostpoints in Fig. 2A). Fitting of these data also reveals two classes of binding sites (Table 1, experiments 1 and 2), both of which appear to be affected by cAMP pretreatment. First and more dramatically, there is a 3-5-fold reduction in the cAMP affinity of the major, lower affinity class (from 293 ± 33 to 1117 ± 276 nM and from 454 ± 106 to 2442 ± 950 nM in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) without an appreciable loss of binding sites. Second, there is a small but reproducible reduction in the number of sites of the high affinity class (31,000 ± 10,000 to 13,000 ± 5000 sites/cell and 10,000 ± 6000 to 1000 ± 1000 sites/cell in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) with no consistent change in their affinity. There is relatively little reduction in the total number of cAMP binding sites (12 ± 7% and 5 ± 19% in experiments 1 and 2, respectively), suggesting that most cAR1 molecules remain on the cell surface following exposure to cAMP. Thus, while some of the loss of binding observed at very low cAMP concentrations (<35 nM) results from changes in both affinity components, the loss seen at higher subsaturating concentrations is largely attributable to the affinity reduction exhibited by the low affinity sites.Tabled 1 To assess whether this pattern of binding changes is a property unique to growth-stage cells, an identical analysis was performed using developed cells (Fig. 2B). As with growth-stage cells, the Scatchard plot of the untreated developed cells is curvilinear and cAMP pretreatment causes a shallowing of the plot. Again, much of the observed change results from a reduction in the affinity of the low affinity receptor form (Table 1, experiments 3 and 4). The total loss of cAMP binding sites may be slightly greater than in growth stage cells (32 ± 6% and 15 ± 11% in experiments 3 and 4, respectively) but does not fully explain the loss of binding. It is unclear whether, in developed cells, there is a reduction in the number of high affinity sites analogous to that observed in growth-stage cells. An overall difference between growth-stage and developed cells is an apparent trend toward increased affinities of all receptor classes in the latter. This increase may reflect the expression of the G-protein subunit, Gα2, which mediates cAR1 signaling during aggregation(49Kesbecke F. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on the Scatchard results, we predicted that cAMP pretreatment should increase the dose dependence of cAR1-mediated responses without altering maximum responsiveness. To test this prediction, we examined the effect of cAMP pretreatment on the subsequent “uptake” of [3H]cAMP. This cAR1-dependent process occurs more slowly than cAMP binding, is very slowly reversible, and does not represent persistent binding to the receptor (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Devreotes P.N. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 897-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12573-12578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, we examined this process in growth-stage cAR1-expressing cells and found that, following cAMP pretreatment, little change in the uptake of high cAMP concentrations occurred while uptake at lower cAMP concentrations is significantly decreased (57% decrease at 10-9M cAMP). This response profile is consistent with a reduction in the affinity of cAR1. The Scatchard analysis indicates that cAMP pretreatment causes a marked alteration in the affinity of most of the receptor molecules on the cell-surface with little or no reduction in the total number of surface binding sites. To extend this observation, we assessed the subcellular localization of cAR1 in cAMP-treated cells by proteolytic treatment of intact cells and by immunofluorescence. For these experiments, we expressed cAR1 containing a c-Myc epitope at its amino terminus in cells. Immunoblots of extracts prepared from these cells revealed a 47-kDa protein with immunoreactivity toward both anti-cAR1 serum and a polyclonal anti-Myc serum (Fig. 4A). Its migration is slightly slower than that of wild-type cAR1, reflecting the addition of 12 amino acids. The Myc-tagged cAR1 was comparable to wild-type cAR1 in binding affinities (data not shown) and extent of loss of ligand binding (80 ± 6% versus 77 ± 1%, measured at 16 nM [3H]cAMP). Unlike the wild-type cAR1, the Myc-tagged cAR1 is sensitive to surface trypsinization. Within 15 min, more than 87% of the molecules are cleaved to yield slightly smaller products which have lost the Myc epitope (Fig. 4B, left). The time dependence of the cleavage strongly suggests that trypsinization is occurring on intact cells, and not during subsequent sample preparation. Co-incubation of samples from trypsin-treated and untreated cells results in no further loss of Myc-tagged cAR1 (data not shown), further supporting this conclusion. When the cells were pretreated with cAMP, the mobility of the Myc-tagged cAR1 on SDS-PAGE was observed to further decrease (Fig. 4, right). This mobility alteration, previously reported for wild-type cAR1, is due to serine phosphorylation on the cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the pretreated cells were subjected to proteolysis, removal of the Myc epitope occurred as extensively as it did in untreated cells (Fig. 4B, right). The slight decrease in the amount of Myc-cAR1 detectable with anti-cAR1 serum (approximately 30% at 15 min, Fig. 4A) might reflect cleavage at basic residues within the cAR1 sequence or an inherent instability in the NH2-terminally cleaved Myc-cAR1. The failure of cAMP pretreatment to protect Myc-cAR1 from proteolysis is consistent with the notion that the reduction in cAMP binding observed upon pretreatment can occur without significant receptor internalization. This interpretation was corroborated by immunofluorescence studies. When untreated cells expressing Myc-cAR1 were rapidly fixed in suspension, they exhibited a predominantly peripheral pattern of immunofluorescent staining with anti-cAR1 antibodies (Fig. 5A). This pattern is similar to that described previously for endogenous cAR1 in developed cells and suggests that most receptor molecules are within the plasma membrane. Despite a 74% reduction of binding at 16 nM [3H]cAMP, cAMP-pretreated cells revealed the same pattern of cAR1 distribution as untreated cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that little if any relocalization had occurred. Vector control cells expressing no cAR1 displayed no peripheral staining under these conditions (data not shown). cAMP stimulates the addition of 3-4 phosphates (29Klein P. Vaughan R. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to serines within the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of cAR1(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This domain contains 18 serine residues organized into four clusters(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these serines and perhaps their phosphorylation play a role in the agonist-induced loss of ligand binding, we examined this process in cAR1 mutants in which combinations of these four serine clusters had been deleted or substituted with alanine and glycine residues(15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, substitution of all of the serine clusters (mutant cm1234) completely abolishes cAMP-induced affinity reduction. Furthermore, while the elimination of serines in clusters 2, 3, and 4 (mutant cm234) has little effect, substitution of the serines of cluster 1 alone (mutant cm1) results in a drastically reduced response. Thus, serines in cluster 1 appear to play a major and specific role in the modulation of cAR1 affinity classes. The nature of loss of ligand binding by G-protein-coupled receptors has been difficult to ascertain. Often, this process has been equated with receptor internalization. Studies using immunofluorescence (31Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wang M. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cell fractionation (33Chuang D.M. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Toews M.L. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11844-11850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed a strong correlation between the loss of ligand binding and the “sequestration” or movement of receptors to a new, apparently intracellular compartment. Consistent with this interpretation, cells expressing β-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, upon pretreatment, lose their ability to bind hydrophilic but not hydrophobic ligands (35Hertel C. Muller P. Portenier M. Staehelin M. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). While the reduction in binding and internalization may be tightly correlated, however, they might be separate processes. Several studies, in fact, have suggested that loss of binding can occur without receptor internalization(36Wang H. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Mahan L.C. Motulsky H.J. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1985; 82: 6566-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous studies of cAR1 (38Van Haastert P.J.M. Wang M. Bominaar A.A. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Tao Y. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15584-15589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our present results support this hypothesis. We demonstrate here that in response to cAMP pretreatment, growth-phase Dictyostelium cells overexpressing cAR1 exhibit a reduction of cAMP binding similar in rate, extent, and concentration dependence to that displayed in developed cells expressing endogenous cAR1. Scatchard analysis and computer fitting of cAMP binding data suggest that this binding alteration is due predominantly to a reduction in the affinity of the lower affinity receptor form, which represents the bulk of cell surface cAR1, with a concomitant small change in the number (but not the affinity) of high affinity binding sites. It is unclear whether this latter change represents an interconversion of high to low affinity sites or a selective removal of high affinity sites from the cell surface. Nevertheless, there is a minimal reduction in the total number of binding sites under these conditions, supporting the hypothesis that even at saturating cAMP concentrations, at least 80% of cAR1 molecules are neither internalized(38Van Haastert P.J.M. Wang M. Bominaar A.A. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Tao Y. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15584-15589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), “irreversibly” occupied with ligand (25Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Devreotes P.N. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 897-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or incapable of binding for other reasons. Developed cells overexpressing cAR1 exhibit a similar pattern of affinity changes, demonstrating that this phenomenon is not a function of the developmental stage. There is some suggestion from the present data, however, that in these cells, cAMP might induce a slightly higher fractional receptor internalization than in growth-stage cells. The binding affinity changes described above are mirrored functionally by changes in cell sensitivity to cAMP. The concentration dependence of cAR1-mediated cAMP uptake, a process distinct from binding, is altered by pretreatment. As with binding, pretreatment causes an apparent transition from high to low sensitivity of uptake, with little or no change in maximal uptake. A different conclusion was drawn in previous studies involving endogenous cAR1 in developed cells. There, Scatchard analysis suggested that loss of ligand binding was due to a reduction in total cAMP binding sites, with little change in affinity(12Klein C. Juliani M.H. Cell. 1977; 10: 329-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7700-7704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Devreotes P.N. Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 897-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We attribute these differences to our use of cells overexpressing cAR1, which enhances the detection of low affinity binding sites. In cAMP binding experiments involving endogenous cAR1, the expression levels are lower than those presented here, resulting in a lower signal-to-noise ratio at higher cAMP concentrations, and thereby precluding the detection of low affinity binding sites. In addition, our initial analysis of growth-stage cells, which exhibit less curvilinear Scatchard plots and less reduction in total binding, also facilitated the detection of changes among the low affinity sites. The protease accessibility and immunofluorescence experiments described here provide physical evidence that nearly all cAR1 molecules remain on the cell surface following cAMP pretreatment. The immunolocalization of cAR1 in cAMP-treated and untreated cells is virtually indistinguishable when these cells are rapidly fixed in suspension, suggesting there is not significant internalization. Furthermore, even after maximal induction of the response, nearly all epitope-tagged cAR1 molecules remain susceptible to surface trypsinization. Consistent with these results, sustained chymotrypsin sensitivity of endogenous cAR1 following cAMP pretreatment has been previously reported(39Tao Y. Klein C. J. Biol.

Our results with epitope-tagged cAR1 strengthen the proposal put forth by these authors that loss of ligand binding can occur without cAR1 internalization. Our immunofluorescence results appear to contradict the previously reported observation that cAR1 localization changes upon cAMP pretreatment from a peripheral pattern to a more punctate, possibly vesicular, one(32Wang M. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Van Haastert P.J.M. Wang M. Bominaar A.A. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We believe that this difference arises from the distinct treatment of the cells used in each case. In the previous studies, cells were allowed to adhere to glass slides, flattened with a sheet of agar, and then methanol-fixed. In the present study, in contrast, shaking cells were rapidly fixed in suspension. We too have found that adherent cells exhibit an apparent cAMP-induced redistribution of cAR1 immunofluorescence (data not shown), unlike cells fixed in suspension. Perhaps cAMP treatment normally induces cAR1 relocalization in the physiological context of a cell attached to a solid surface, while in suspension, the internalization process is uncoupled. Thus, the transition in cAR1 affinity appears not to depend upon internalization, though it might reflect an early step in this process, such as the binding of a component of the endocytic machinery to the receptor. Several domains within G-protein-coupled receptors have been described as important for agonist-induced reductions in ligand binding. Mutant adrenergic, muscarinic, or cAMP receptors bearing substitutions or deletions within the putative second and third intracellular loops have shown drastic impairment in this process(16Caterina M.J.

Replacement of a human β2-adrenergic receptor tyrosine (Tyr326) with an alanine has no influence on G-protein activation or desensitization with respect to adenylyl cyclase activation but blocks loss of ligand binding, receptor relocalization, and resensitization of the cyclase response(43Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tyrosine occurs within a sequence motif near the COOH-terminal end of the putative seventh transmembrane domain of many G-protein-coupled receptors (NPX2-3Y, where X represents aliphatic residues). A similar phenotype is seen with β-adrenergic receptor mutants in which putative targets of protein kinase A phosphorylation have been changed to alanines(44Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 45Yu S.S Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, removal of all serines from the COOH terminus of this receptor does not prevent the agonist-induced reduction of ligand binding(44Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that β-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation is unnecessary for loss of binding. Our present studies with cAR1 suggest that a subset of COOH-terminal serines is required for loss of cAMP binding. A cAR1 mutant lacking all serines in the cytoplasmic COOH terminus cannot undergo this process. Substitution of the 5 serines that comprise cluster 1 (serines 299, 302, 303, 304, and 308) with alanine and glycine residues (mutant cm1) results in a severe reduction in both the rate and extent of the agonist-induced binding changes, while substitution of all other serines in the COOH-terminal tail has virtually no effect. We previously demonstrated (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that approximately two-thirds of the cAMP-induced phosphorylation of cAR1 occurs within serine cluster 1 and the remainder occurs within cluster 2 (serines 324, 325, and 331). Which of these residues are modified has not yet been determined. The remaining 10 serines of the COOH-terminal domain, which comprise clusters 3 and 4 (as defined in (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not phosphorylated in response to cAMP binding. Phosphorylation occurring within cluster 1 is strongly correlated with the adaptation of cAMP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase(11Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Klein P. Vaughan R. Borleis J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity transition and phosphorylation undergone by cAR1 in response to cAMP appear to share either common or overlapping structural requirements within this domain. cAR1 contains two NPXnY motifs similar to that implicated in β2-adrenergic receptor loss of ligand binding(5Klein P.S. Sun T.J. Saxe III, C.L. Kimmel A.R. Johnson R.L. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1988; 241: 1467-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 43Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first of these (NPLMWRY277) like those of other receptors is located at the COOH-terminal portion of the seventh transmembrane domain. The second (NPSPY301) includes Ser299 of serine cluster 1 in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It is tempting to speculate that the latter is important for the loss of ligand binding in light of its proximity to cluster 1. Note, however, that in mutant cm1, which is impaired in loss of ligand binding, this sequence (NPAPY301) resembles the proposed consensus sequence even more closely than does the wild-type sequence. The mechanisms by which serine replacement affects cAR1 loss of ligand binding therefore remain to be clarified. In summary, agonist-induced loss of cAMP binding sites appears to involve a 3-5-fold reduction in the affinity of the predominant low affinity receptor form and is not dependent upon receptor internalization. The reduction in affinity could, however, reflect an intermediate step in the internalization process. Furthermore, this affinity transition depends upon a domain in the cAR1 cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus, which is also a target of cAMP-induced phosphorylation. Continued analysis of these processes should allow a detailed molecular description of the various adaptive changes undergone by cAR1 upon agonist binding.

Neuro-Oncol. 1991; 10: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The initiation of angiogenesis requires the physical breakdown of the basement membrane. Degradation of collagen IV represents a significant step in this process, since it composes between 60 and 90% of the basement membrane(8Bosman F.T. Cluetjens J. Beek C. Havenith M. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Type IV collagenases belong to the matrix metalloprotease family of enzymes.

The multiple degradative activities of proteasomes may be involved in the degradation of the vascular basement membrane during tumor-associated angiogenesis. At least four different proteasomes have been identified. Two represent intracellular proteasomes, the most extensively studied being the mammalian 20 S multicatalytic proteasome (9Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and the archaebacterial proteasome isolated from Thermoplasma acidophilum(10Dahlmann B. Kuehn L. Grziwa A. Zwickl P.

In working toward a goal of inhibiting tumor-associated angiogenesis, the extracellular enzymes secreted from C6 astrocytoma cells, which degrade collagen IV and nonfibrous proteins, were isolated and characterized in this study. α-[3H]Casein and 125I-β-insulin were kindly provided by R. A. Cook. Human collagen IV, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, EDTA, and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Sigma. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP-2) was obtained from Amgen. [35S]Methionine was obtained from ICN Biochemicals. Non-conditioned 10% fetal calf serum and non-conditioned serum-free medium were examined for collagenase IV and general protease activities utilizing the method described in the section “Proteolytic Assays.” The extent of cell lysis was determined by assaying for the intracellular marker lactate dehydrogenase in homogenized cells and in serum-free conditioned medium according to the method of Wroblewski et al. (14). [35S]Methionine studies were utilized to confirm that the proteasome-like enzyme arose from inside the C6 astrocytoma cells in culture. C6 cells were initially grown in 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium, the cells were then placed in serum-free medium containing 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and incubated for 4 h. The unconcentrated medium was then collected and run through the purification protocol listed below. The radioactive peak on the Superose 6 column, corresponding to the molecular weight of the proteasome, was characterized through inhibitor studies to identify this radioactive peak as the extracellular proteasome. Previous studies (3Vaithilingam I.S. McDonald W. Brown N.K. Stroude E.C. Cook R.A. Del Maestro R.F. J. Neursurg. 1992; 77: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Vaithilingam I.S.

Neursurg. 1992; 19: 17-22Google Scholar) indicated that C6 astrocytoma cells released collagenase IV continuously throughout growth; also the magnitude of this activity fluctuated during this period. In this study, serum-free medium conditioned by C6 astrocytoma cells was obtained for each of the five days of growth. Ten plates of serum-free medium were seeded with 3 × 104 cells on day 0. Conditioned medium was collected from two plates each day and concentrated 50-fold. This medium was not changed on a daily basis, to allow for continuous growth. The extracellular proteasome activity and gelatinase A activity were determined utilizing [3H]collagen IV as the substrate. The levels of extracellular proteasome activity throughout growth were assessed by adding 2.5 mM EDTA to the assay to block gelatinase activity. In contrast, when gelatinase A activity was assessed, 1 mM 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin was added to block EP activity. C6 cells were initially grown to subconfluency in three Nunclon tissue culture flasks (surface area 175 cm2), containing minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Myo-clone), penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). Seven flasks (175 cm2) each containing 50 ml of serum-free medium were inoculated with 3 × 106 cells. The cells were grown four days, at which point the conditioned medium was collected and concentrated. Serum-free conditioned medium was concentrated to 3 mg/ml on a YM-10 Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (Amicon, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). 200 μl of this sample was loaded onto a FPLC Mono Q HR 5/5 column (5 × 50 mm) resulting in two peaks of collagenase IV activity (data not shown). Each peak of collagenase IV activity from the Mono Q column was pooled and concentrated to 2 mg/ml using a YM-10 Amicon ultrafiltration membrane, simultaneously exchanged with gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 200 mM NaCl at pH 7.5). 200 μl of each peak was loaded onto a FPLC Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (10 × 300 mm). Each of the gel filtration columns were calibrated using the molecular weight standards denoted on the column chromatographs. The gel filtration standards were separately dissolved in column buffer to 2 mg/ml, 200 μl of this sample was run on the column. Each peak from the Mono Q column eluted at significantly different times when run on the the Superose 12 column, indicating both a high molecular weight and a low molecular weight collagenase IV. For a more accurate determination of the size of the high molecular weight collagenase IV peak, a Superose 6 column was utilized with the gel filtration standards. Proteolytic activity was assayed by measuring the degradation of α-[3H]casein and [3H]collagen type IV to products soluble in 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The α-casein and type IV collagen were labeled as described previously(3Vaithilingam I.S. McDonald W. Brown N.K. Stroude E.C. Cook R.A. Del Maestro R.F. J. Neursurg. 1992; 77: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To maintain linearity of the proteolytic activity, 1-3 μg of protein was utilized in each assay. One unit of activity represents the amount of enzyme required to solubilize 1 μg of [3H]collagen IV or α-[3H]casein or β-[3H]insulin per h at 37°C. Specific activity on each of the substrates is expressed as units per mg of protein. 5% discontinous (15Weitman D. Etlinger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6977-6982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or continuous at pH 8.3 (16Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15923) Google Scholar) nondenaturing gels were utilized. For the discontinuous gel, 10 μl of 1 mg/ml samples were loaded in buffer containing, 0.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Similar sample conditions were followed for the continuous gel except that the sample buffer had a pH of 8.3. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out according to the method of O'Farrell(17O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard low molecular weight markers obtained from Pharmacia were used to calibrate the 12% SDS gel of the second dimension. Two types of samples containing the extracellular proteasome were subjected to 5% native gel electrophoresis. One represented unconcentrated, unfractionated, or total conditioned free media, while the second was a proteasome sample purified through column chromatography. Nine lanes for each of these samples were run on this native gel. One lane was stained with Coomassie Blue to determine the number of bands (purity) and location of bands, while the remaining eight lanes were not stained. The unstained lanes were also sliced. The first slices (top of each lane) of each of the seven lanes were pooled and suspended in 70 μl of assay buffer. This was carried out for the subsequent slices. Elution was accomplished by storing the gel slices in buffer at 4°C overnight. A Pasteur pipette was then used to draw the liquid and subsequently to wash the gel slices. 30 μl of the band arising from the “unfractionated” media while 10 μl of enzyme from the column purified sample was utilized per assay. An aliquot from the Superose 6 gel filtration column containing the 1000-kDa fraction was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The proteasome structure was observed using a Philips EM 300 electron microscope at a magnification of 928,000 ×. Inhibitors were included in the collagenase IV assay, the α-casein, and β-insulin assay. The total assay mixture in each tube for each of the three different assays was 500 μl. Inhibitors were preincubated with an aliquot of enzyme for 10 min at 22°C before addition of the respective substrates and assay at 37°C. Dichloroisocoumarin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone were dissolved in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration per assay was 5%). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and p-chloromercuribenzoate, L-cysteine, and N-ethylmaleimide, 1,10-phenanthroline were dissolved in 50% ethanol (final concentration per assay was 1.0%). EDTA, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and E64 were dissolved in distilled water. Peptidase activity against the following synthetic substrates were measured: N-CBZ-Ala-Arg-Arg-4-methoxy-β-naphthylamide, N-CBZ-Leu-Leu-Glu-β-naphthylamide, and N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. Each of the substrates were separately incubated at a concentration of 0.05 mM with 4 μg of the proteasome in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, 200 mM NaCl, at pH 7.5, including 5% Me2SO. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 60 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. Enzyme activity was assessed by fluorometry according to the method of Ozaki et al.(18Ozaki M. Fujinami K. Tanaka K. Amemiya Y. Sato T. Ogura N. Nakagawa H. J. Biol.

N-(3-[2-Furyl]acryolyl)-Leu-Gly-Pro-Ala was detected by the method of Van Wart et al.(20Van Wart H.E. Steinbrink D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of N-(3-[2-furyl]acryolyl)-Phe-Gly-Gly was detected by the method of Holmquist et al.(21Holmquist B. Bünning P. Riordan J.F. Anal.

Finally, breakdown of N-CBZ-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroanilide was detected by the method of Lyublinskaya et al.(23Lyublinskaya L.A. Belyaev S.V. Strongin A.Y.A. Matyash L.F. Levin E.D. Stepanov V.M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned medium from C6 astrocytoma cells grown to day 3 was fractionated using filtration membranes: YM-10, YM-30, and XM-300. The 30-300-kDa fraction contained the active 68-kDa collagenase IV while the >300-kDa fraction contained the proteasome. Each of these two samples were electrophesed on a 4-15% SDS gradient gel (mini-protein ready gel, Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-nitrocellulose (Millipore) for 4 h at 100 volts; transfer buffer included, 4.5 g of Tris, 21.6 g of glycine, 300 ml of MeOH, and 1200 ml of H2O. The blot was developed according to the Bio-Rad procedures (Amplified Alkaline Phosphatase Immuno-blot Assay Procedure). A primary rabbit anti-human antibody to recombinant 72-kDa collagenase IV was utilized (kindly provided by W. G. Stetler-Stevenson). Two modifications to this procedure: the primary antibody was incubated for 2 h and the low molecular weight blocker, peptide 175 (provided by W. G. Stetler-Stevenson), was also included in the blocking solution. Serum-free medium conditioned by C6 cells was utilized to isolate and characterize the extracellular proteolytic activities. Control studies were carried out to ensure that the extracellular activities were not the result of proteolytic activity already present in non-conditioned medium, nor due to cell lysis. Collagenase IV activity was neither present in 10% fetal calf serum nor serum-free media. General protease activity present in non-conditioned media containing serum contributed less than 3% of total activity to the fetal calf serum-conditioned medium. General protease activity was not present in serum-free medium. In conjunction with these control medium studies, [35S]methionine studies confirm that the extracellular proteasome with collagenase IV activity was released from C6 cells and was not initially present in the media (Fig. 2B). To ensure that the extracellular location of the collagenase IV enzymes and general proteases in the serum-free conditioned medium were not due to cell lysis, activity of the intracellular enzyme marker lactate dehydrogenase was examined. The ratio of extracellular to intracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity was 0.0025/0.17, thereby only 1.5% lactate dehydrogenase activity was present in the extracellular media. Cell lysis did not appear to be significant in these studies. Day 0, represents the time when the C6 cells are placed in serum-free medium after growing in fetal calf serum (Fig. 1). Collagenase IV activity was absent at this time point, subsequently, total collagenase IV activity increased to peak on day 2 of growth, followed by a decline. These data confirms that the extracellular proteolytic activities found were not present in the non-conditioned medium, but were released at varying levels from growing C6 astrocytoma cells in culture. To identify and characterize the protease(s) present in the day 2 peak, a purification protocol was established, which utilized a FPLC Mono Q anion-exchange column followed by a FPLC Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Fig. 2A) and Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration columns (Fig. 2B). Day 2 medium was resolved into two peaks of collagenase IV activities (Fig. 2A). The first peak represented a 1000-kDa collagenase IV activity while the second peak contained the low molecular weight collagenase IV activity at 68 kDa. A more accurate determination of the molecular weight for the first peak was obtained utilizing a Superose 6 column, which eluted at 57 min, indicating a molecular mass of 1000 kDa (Fig. 2B). All column buffers utilized in this purification protocol did not contain calcium to eliminate the possibility of aggregation of the 68-kDa collagenase IV into the higher molecular weight collagenase IV. Purified aliquots of the 68-kDa collagenase IV were subjected to 5, 10, and 15 mM Ca2+. The latter two concentrations of calcium resulted in aggregation of the 68-kDa enzyme into dimers and trimers, higher aggregation units, however, were not obtained. Peak activity column fractions were analyzed on a 5% native gel (Fig. 3A) illustrating a single protein band. This native band was also observed in unconcentrated and nonfractionated conditioned medium. Gel purified enzyme and buffer elution of the band from both the fractionated and nonfractionated samples were similar in biochemical characteristics, attributed to that of the extracellular proteasome. The denatured form of this protein was subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis, indicating three subunit bands, two isoelectric variants at 70-kDa (Fig. 3, B2 and B3), and a single band at 65 kDa (Fig. 3, B4). The activated form of the matrix metalloprotease (68 kDa) is illustrated in Fig. 3, C2. Electron microscopy demonstrated a circular structure 11 nm in diameter (Fig. 4), which appears to represent an end-on view of an elongated cylinder(10Dahlmann B. Kuehn L. Grziwa A. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Palmer A. Mason G.G. Paramio J.M. Knecht E. Rivett A.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 163-175PubMed Google Scholar). These purification and structural studies identified the high molecular weight collagenase IV as a proteasome as defined by Rivett (9Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) and Tanaka et al.(12Tanaka K. Tamura T. Yoshimura T. Ichihara A. The New Biol. 1992; 4: 173-187PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 4:Structure of the extracellular proteasome. An aliquot from the Superose 12 gel filtration column containing the 1000-kDa purified fraction was negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The structure of the proteasome was then examined utilizing a Philips EM 300 electron microscope at a magnification × 928,000. Each of the three proteasomes shown contain an average inside diameter of 11 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For characterization and comparison with known proteasomes, the extracellular proteasome and the 68-kDa enzyme were tested against a variety of natural substrates (Table 1). Further characterization of substrate specificity by EP utilized synthetic peptide substrates. Although the extracellular proteasome complex was isolated and identified by collagenolytic IV activity; α-casein and β-chain of insulin also represent adequate substrates. To determine if the catalytic sites were distinct for each of the different substrates, inhibitor studies were performed(10Dahlmann B. Kuehn L. Grziwa A. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Collagenase IV activity was inhibited by the serine protease inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The hydrophobic microenvironment provided by Me2SO and ethanol, the solvents in which these inhibitors were dissolved, enhanced the collagenase IV activity of the extracellular proteasome by 4 and 2.2 ×, respectively. This microenvironment did not affect the general protease activity of the extracellular proteasome. The activity of this complex on the general protein substrates α-casein and the β-chain of insulin were inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitors EDTA, 1,10-o-phenanthroline, and TIMP-2.Tabled 1 The specific activity of EP on collagen IV is at least two times greater than that of gelatinase A. Unlike gelatinase A, the collagenase IV activity of EP is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors rather than metalloprotease inhibitors. Also gelatinase A does not degrade α-casein nor β-insulin. At least two independent catalytic sites appear to be present on the proteasome. For the synthetic peptide substrates tested, EP does not contain peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activity nor chymotrypsin-like activity (Table 2). EP degrades only one of the two trypsin-like substrates utilized. Collagenase activity and angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed using the respective synthetic peptide substrates. EP did not hydrolyze the thermolysin-like nor the subtilisin-like substrates.Tabled 1 Western blot analysis indicated that both the 70-kDa subunit band and the 68-kDa bond bound the antibody to human 72-kDa enzyme (Fig. 5). Ongoing studies will determine if one or both of the 70-kDa pI variants of the protease binds to the antibody. The 65-kDa subunit band, however, did not react with the antibody. This suggests that at least one of the 70-kDa variants is related to the 68-kDa matrix metalloprotease through protein sequence homology, although differing in sensitivity to protease inhibitors. Growing C6 astrocytoma cells in monolayer culture release at least two types of collagenase IV activities into serum-free conditioned medium, in addition to general protease activities. The serine-sensitive type IV collagenase activity is associated with a novel EP of 1000 kDa, while the 68-kDa activity represents the activated form of the 72-kDa matrix metalloprotease gelatinase A. These studies were conducted in the absence of calcium to eliminate the possibility of aggregation, even though the presence of 10 or 15 mM Ca2+ does not induce aggregation of the 68-kDa collagenase IV to form the 1000-kDa collagenase IV. Also these two enzymes represent two different types of collagenase IV activities. Unconcentrated, dilute serum-free conditioned medium still contained the 1000-kDa collagenase IV activity, excluding the possibility that concentration of the 68-kDa unit resulted in the higher molecular weight collagenase IV. The lower molecular weight collagenase IV does not degrade noncollagenase IV substrates, whereas the proteasome also degrades α-casein and β-insulin. The varying levels of each of these collagenases during C6 growth in culture, further distinguishes the 68-kDa collagenase IV from the 1000-kDa collagenase IV. Although the two type IV collagenase activities are distinguishable by inhibitor studies, antibody studies suggested a relationship between the 70-kDa subunits (ongoing studies will determine if the antibody binds to one or both of the 70-kDa pI variants) of the proteasome and the 68-kDa enzyme. According to Western blot analysis, the 65-kDa subunit of the proteasome does not appear to be related to either of these collagenase IV activities. These findings in addition to the inhibitor studies carried out on gelatin zymography, 2I. S. Vaithilingam, W. McDonald, and R. F. Del Maestro, unpublished data. indicate that the type IV collagenase activity of the proteasome is associated with one or both the 70-kDa subunits. The remaining 65-kDa subunit of the proteasome may then be responsible for the general protease activity. Each characteristic of EP, if considered separately does not constitute a unique finding. However, a combination of these particular characteristics on a single extracellular proteasome has not been reported. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that proteasomes are distributed intracellularly in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells from a variety of tissues(24Tanaka K. Yoshimura T. Tamura T. Fujiwara T. Kumatori A. Ichihara A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Beyette J.R. Mykles D.L.

Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Rajabi M. Dean D.D. Woessner J.F. Obstet. & Gynecol. 1987; 69: 179-186PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wada M. Kosaka M. Saito S. Sano T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 121: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar). The proteasome included in this group appears to be located extracellularly, possibly through lysis of tumor cells and hepatocytes associated with liver injury(28Wada M. Kosaka M. Saito S. Sano T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 121: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, EP is released by intact growing C6 astrocytoma cells. A high molecular weight metallo-collagenase IV (>2000 kDa) has been isolated from human carcinoma tissue(29Tsuda T.T. Kodama A. Yamamura M. Matsuzaki S. Tsuda M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Another proteasome sensitive to 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin has been isolated in the archaebacterium T. acidophilum(10Dahlmann B. Kuehn L. Grziwa A. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This bacterial proteasome hydrolyses peptide substrates and 14C-methylated casein, however, type IV collagenase activity has not been examined. While the 20 S mammalian multicatalytic proteasome and the archaebacterial proteasome demonstrate trypsin, chymotrypsin, and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities, the EP differs in that it contains trypsin-like activity, collagenase activity, and angiotensin converting enzyme activity on synthetic peptide substrates. Studies utilizing synthetic substrates may be informative in the classification of protease activity, regarding the amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site (either, basic, aromatic, or glutamic), however, little is understood about the degradation of natural protein substrates. Also studies utilizing synthetic peptide substrates for classification of proteases may be misleading as suggested by Baumeister et al.(30Wenzel T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Information on the EP activity of the synthetic substrates studied should only be utilized for initial comparison, utilizing similar studies conducted on other known proteasomes. The bacterial proteasome isolated from Thermoplasma represents the simplest subunit structure for a proteasome to date, being composed of two types of subunits: an α subunit of 27 kDa and β subunit of 25 kDa(31Dahlmann B. Kopp F. Kuehn L. Niedel B. Pfeifer G. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). EP has three subunits, two pI variants at 70 kDa and a single band at 65 kDa. EP is not composed of the 22-35-kDa range of multiple subunits characteristic of other mammalian proteasomes(1Alvarez O.A. Carmichael D.F. De Clerck Y.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 4Vaithilingam I.S. Stroude E.C. McDonald W. Del Maestro R.F. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1991; 10: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Comparison of the subunit structures thereby further differentiates the EP from the archaebacterial proteasome and the mammalian 20 S proteasome. Proteasomes contain more than one independent active site on the same protein complex(9Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Each site is sensitive to particular inhibitors, and accommodates certain substrates. EP contains at least two active sites. A serine active site which appears to be involved in the degradation of collagenase IV and a site sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors which degrades α-casein and β-insulin. EP degrades large complex substrates such as collagenase IV and relatively smaller polypeptides such as α-casein and β-insulin. The digestion of multiple substrates and the extracellular location of EP may account for the breakdown of many protein components of the basement membrane structure and extracellular space(4Vaithilingam I.S. Stroude E.C. McDonald W. Del Maestro R.F. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1991; 10: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Vaithilingam I.S. McDonald W. Stroude E.C. Cook R.A. Del Maestro R.F. Can. J. Neursurg. 1992; 19: 17-22Google Scholar). The levels and type of collagenase IV activity seen is dependent on the growth phase of C6 astrocytoma cells. After initial cell plating (day 2: early log), EP represents the major collagenase IV activity observed, whereas with continued growth (day 4: stationary), gelatinase A is the major contributor to collagen IV degradation. At the present time it is not clear what role the varying levels of the two different types of collagenase IV play in the initiation of angiogenesis, however, this finding does indicate that effective inhibition of collagenase IV activity may require a combination of serine protease inhibitors and metalloprotease inhibitors. The release of collagenase IV activities from C6 astrocytoma cells, which are sensitive to two different types of inhibitors, may result in a more controlled degradation of the basement membrane. If either a serine or a metalloprotease inhibitor was available at different times in vivo, it would appear that only one of the two activities of the EP would be expressed at this time. This study indicates that the inclusion of both types of protease inhibitors may result in effective inhibition of the extracellular collagenase IV activities released from C6 cells. To our knowledge, EP represents the first extracellular proteasome not released through cell lysis. The combined characteristics for EP have not been observed for proteasomes known to date. The multicatalytic ability together with the substrate specificity of this extracellular proteasome suggests it may play a significant role in the initiation of angiogenesis. The development of strategies for the inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis should take into account the activities of this proteasome-like structure. We thank Dr. R. A. Cook and Dr. V. J.

https://openalex.org/W1993468986,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate with the formation of an acetyl residue and reducing equivalents, which are transferred sequentially to the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase components. To examine the role of tryptophanyl residue(s) in the active site of E1, the enzyme was modified with the tryptophan-specific reagent N-bromosuccinimide. Modification of 2 tryptophan residues/mol of bovine E1 (out of 12 in a tetramer α2β2) resulted in complete inactivation of the enzyme. The inactivation was prevented by preincubation with thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP), indicating that the modified tryptophan residue(s) is a part of the active site of this enzyme. Fluorescence studies showed that thiamin pyrophosphate interacts with tryptophan residue(s) of E1. The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectral intensity at ∼292 nm was decreased by ∼15% for E1 + TPP relative to the intensity for E1 alone. Because this MCD band is uniquely sensitive to and quantitative for tryptophan, the simplest interpretation is that 1 out of 6 tryptophan residues present in E1 (αβ dimer) interacts with TPP. The natural circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of E1 is dramatically altered upon binding TPP, with concomitant induction of optical activity at ∼263 nm for the nonchiral TPP macrocyle. From CD studies, it is also inferred that loss of activity following N-bromosuccinimide treatment occurred without significant changes in the overall secondary structure of the protein. A single peptide was isolated by differential peptide mapping in the presence and absence of thiamin pyrophosphate following modification with N-bromosuccinimide. This peptide generated from human E1 was found to correspond to amino acid residues 116-143 in the deduced sequence of human E1β, suggesting that the tryptophan residue 135 in the β subunit of human E1 functions in the active site of E1. The amino acid sequences surrounding this tryptophan residue are conserved in E1β from several species, suggesting that this region may constitute a structurally and/or functionally essential part of the enzyme.

The multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) 1The abbreviations used are: PDCpyruvate dehydrogenase complexE1pyruvate dehydrogenaseTPPthiamin pyrophosphateNBSN-bromosuccinimideHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMCDmagnetic circular dichroism. plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism by regulating the oxidation of pyruvate. The mammalian complex consists of several catalytic as well as regulatory components namely, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, protein X, E1α-kinase, and phospho- E1α-phosphatase(1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-46Crossref Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 2Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1989; 4: 3224-3233Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The E1 tetramer (α2β2) has two active centers with equal catalytic efficiency but different affinity for thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP)(3Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1982; 5: 523-532Google Scholar). Considering the importance of this component in the overall catalytic reaction in the complex, little is known about the structure of the active site. Studies involving chemical modification of E1 have implicated the amino acid residues lysine(4Stepp L.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7187-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), histidine, arginine, tryptophan, and cysteine (5Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The primary structures of both α and β subunits of E1 from several species have been deduced from their cDNA sequences(7Ho L. Wexler I.D. Liu T-C. Thekkumkara T.J. Patel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The possible functional significance of several motifs in these deduced sequences have also been proposed based on sequence homology(12Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Wexler I.D. Hemalatha S.G. Patel M.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hawkins et al. (12Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) have identified a sequence motif of approximately 30 residues in length in several TPP-dependent enzymes; this motif begins with the sequence GDG and ends with NN. Aspargine has also been suggested as a possible residue for TPP binding(12Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Dahl et al. (14Dahl H.H.M. Hunt S.M. Hutchison W.M. Brown G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7398-7403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have speculated that tryptophan residue 214 of the α subunit of human E1 may be a possible site of TPP binding. In a number of TPP-dependent enzymes like Escherichia coli pyruvate oxidase(15O'Brien T. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3302-3307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase(16Diefanbach R.J. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transketolase(17Kochetov G.A. Usmanov R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 1134-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), tryptophan has been implicated in TPP binding from spectral analysis and chemical modification studies. Thus, clarification of the involvement of tryptophan or aspargine residue(s) in TPP binding in these enzymes is of fundamental importance. To investigate the possible role of tryptophan residue(s) in the structure-function relationship and to explore its specific localization in the E1 component of mammalian PDC, we have treated both highly purified bovine E1 and recombinant human E1 with NBS, a tryptophan-specific chemical reagent. We have identified by differential peptide mapping and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by sequence analysis that the tryptophan residue of E1, which is involved in TPP binding, corresponds to the tryptophan residue at position 135 in the human E1β subunit. TPP, sequencing grade trypsin, and pyruvate were purchased from Sigma; NBS was purchased from Aldrich; HPLC grade acetonitrile was from Fisher, and trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce. Bovine kidney PDC was purified as previously described(18Roche T.E. Cate R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and its components were resolved according to Linn et al.(19Linn T.C. Pelley J.W. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Randall D.D. Reed L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 148: 327-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recombinant human E1 overexpressed in E. coli M15 cells was purified by the method of Korotchkina et al.(20Korotchkina L.G. Tucker M.M. Thekkumkara T.J. Madhusudhan K.T. Pons G. Kim H. Patel M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). PDC activity was assayed by reconstituting E1 with dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase-X and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase according to the method of Roche and Reed(21Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein was determined spectrophotometrically using BIO-RAD protein reagent, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Bovine E1 (0.64 nmol) was incubated with varying concentrations of freshly prepared NBS in 0.1 ml of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) at 25°C. The progress of the reaction was monitored at 280 nm (21Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (model UV160U), while the corresponding decreases in enzymatic activity were measured by analyzing aliquots from reaction mixtures directly in the standard reconstituted PDC activity assay(21Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The number of tryptophan residues oxidized by NBS was determined by the method of Spande and Witkop(22Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-506Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The possibility of modification of tyrosine residues was also assessed from spectral analysis(23Holmes C.F.B. Campbell D.G. Candwell F.B. Aitken A. Cohen P. Eur.J. Biochem. 1986; 155: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the protection experiments, the enzyme was preincubated with TPP alone, pyruvate alone, or TPP plus pyruvate, for 10 min followed by incubation with varying concentrations of NBS. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer (model LS-5B) spectrofluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm (bandwidth, 10 nm). The emission spectra were obtained over the range of 300-400 nm (bandwidth, 5 nm). Reactions were performed at 25°C and initiated by addition of incremental amounts of TPP to bovine E1 (0.1 mg/ml) in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. MCD and circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained for bovine E1 in the presence of a 2-fold excess of TPP and also for a 200 μM sample of TPP itself. The data were obtained on Jasco J-720 spectrometer, equipped with a 1.5 Tesla (15,000 Gauss) electromagnet, using 1-mm quartz suprasil cuvettes. The instrument was calibrated daily prior to use with ammonium-d camphor-10-sulfonate (Jasco, Tokyo). Measurements were carried out at 18°C under a magnetic flux density of 1.39 Tesla, with the magnetic field direction parallel to the direction of light propagation. All samples were in pH 7.2 potassium phosphate buffer containing 1 mM Mg-EDTA. Experimental conditions for data collection were: wavelength range, 250-350 nm; 9-16 scan accumulation; spectral step resolution, 0.1 nm; scan rate, 20 nm/min; slit width, 1 nm; response, 0.25 s. Data manipulation and calculations utilized the Jasco J-720 software. CD data are presented as Δ∊ (M cm-1). Far ultraviolet (protein region CD spectra of both native and NBS-modified E1 preparations were recorded between 190 and 260 nm at 25°C using a J-600 Spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo). Human E1 (6.4 μM) modified with 0.25 mM NBS both in the presence and absence of TPP (1 mM) and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10-fold excess of tryptophan. The samples were dialyzed extensively overnight against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and then digested with trypsin (1:25, w/w, protease:protein) for 20-24 h in the presence of 6 M urea. In the case of NBS-modified bovine E1, the protein was digested with V8 protease for 48 h in the presence of 2 M guanidinium chloride. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Separation of peptides generated after trypsin digestion of both native and NBS-oxidized E1 samples was achieved using a Shimadzu HPLC system (model LC 600) equipped with a Synchropack C-4 reverse phase column (4.6 × 25 mm). The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in triply distilled water, and peptides were eluted with a 0-60% acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 120 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored simultaneously at 220 and 280 nm. The peptide peak of interest was dissolved in 0.5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and reinjected onto a C-8 reverse phase column. Separation was performed using a linear gradient of 10-40% acetonitrile in 90 min at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The purified peptide was sequenced using an Applied Biosystems model 470A/120A automatic gas phase sequencer(24Hunkapiller M.W. Hewick R.M. Dreyer W.J. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Bovine E1 exhibited a characteristic fluorescence emission with maximal intensity at 335 nm when excited at 295 nm. At this excitation wavelength, both tyrosine and phenylalanine contribute very little to the observed fluorescence, and the inner filter effect due to TPP absorption is also minimized. Experiments were conducted to study whether TPP, pyruvate, or Mg2+ interactions with the enzyme would induce changes in the accessibility of tryptophan residue(s) as reflected by changes in fluorescence quenching patterns. Among these ligands, only TPP substantially quenched the fluorescence intensity of E1. Fig. 1A shows that sequential addition of TPP to bovine E1 produced a progressive quenching of the tryptophanyl fluorescence of E1. Fig. 1B shows the dependence of the fluorescence intensity at the emission maximum on TPP concentration. These data indicate that the fluorescent tryptophan residue(s) is located at or near the TPP binding site. Barth et al. (25Barth G. Voelter W. Bunnenberg E. Djerassi C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) first reported the use of MCD spectroscopy for quantitative determination of tryptophan, noting that “tryptophan is the only naturally occurring amino acid that gives a positive MCD band.” The ∼292-nm MCD band intensity for tryptophan was shown to be independent of the amino acid location within the peptide chain and was not influenced by peptide conformation, even upon protein denaturation. Furthermore, the MCD intensity of tryptophan was not affected by pH in the range between 1 and 12(25Barth G. Voelter W. Bunnenberg E. Djerassi C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As noted by Holmquist and Vallee(26Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), MCD spectroscopy can be used with high sensitivity and accuracy to identify and quantitate tryptophan. Fig. 2 presents the MCD spectra of bovine E1 + TPP (solidline), E1 (dashedline), and the (E1 + TPP) - E1 difference spectrum (dotted-dashed line). The MCD maximum is, as expected, at ∼292 nm for both native and the (E1 + TPP) samples. A 15-17% decrease in intensity, concomitant with a red shift of ∼0.3 nm, occurred upon binding of TPP to bovine E1 (compare the solid and dashedspectra). This is perhaps most clearly shown by the dotted-dashed line, the difference spectrum of (E1 + TPP) - E1. These data strongly suggest that 1 out of 6 tryptophan residues of E1 interacts with TPP leading to a major loss in its MCD signal. We cannot eliminate partial reduction of the signal of more than one Trp, but the reduction in signal must result from an interaction changing the electronic character of Trp, and this is most easily explained with a change in single Trp. One possibility for the loss in signal is that binding of TPP to E1 involves a “stacking” interaction with the tryptophan residue(5Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is interesting, if this model is accurate, that stacking should cause a loss of MCD intensity (to our knowledge, such a perturbation of tryptophan MCD by stacking has not been previously addressed). The MCD bands of tryptophan were identified by comparision with their absorption bands (assigned by Strickland et al.(27Strickland E.H. Horwitz J. Billups C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4914-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The ∼292-nm MCD band of indole chromophores, i.e. tryptophan, was assigned by Holmquist and Vallee (26Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4409-4417Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to a π-π∗, Lb (0-0) transition. Albinsson et al. (28Albinsson B. Kubista M. Norden B. Thulstrup E.W. J. Phys. Chem. 1989; 93: 6646-6654Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that the UV transition moment was at + 45 ± 5o relative to the pseudo symmetry long axis. Thus, our data suggest that the nature of the tryptophan-thiamin interaction results in loss of this transition. This is of particular interest given the normal insensitivity of this feature to perturbants such as solvent, pH, or protein conformation. Fig. 3 presents the natural CD spectra of bovine E1 + TPP (solidline), E1 (dashedline), and TPP alone (parallelingbaseline). As evident from the spectrum, TPP alone has no optical activity. However, upon binding to bovine E1, a dramatic spectral change occurred (compare solid and dashedspectra). The entire spectrum becomes shifted upwards, and there is a new, intense feature at ∼263 nm, coincident with the electronic absorption maximum of TPP. Thus, these data represent a classic example of “induced optical activity,” with the optically inactive TPP coupling to the optically active protein chromophore, resulting in the observed spectral pattern. There is also a dramatic shift at higher wavelengths, as previously reported by Khailova and co-workers(3Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1982; 5: 523-532Google Scholar, 5Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Incubation of bovine E1 with increasing concentrations of NBS resulted in a progressive decrease in the enzyme activity (Fig. 4A). About 95% of the activity was lost from the treatment of E1 with 0.25 mM NBS for 1 min. Addition of TPP provided protection against NBS inactivation; about 60% protection was afforded by 0.4 mM TPP. However, a further increase in concentration of TPP to 1 mM did not have any significant additional effect. A similar effect of TPP against the inactivation of E. coli pyruvate oxidase has also been reported(15O'Brien T. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3302-3307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of pyruvate to bovine E1 did not protect against NBS inactivation. Our findings of TPP protection against NBS inactivation of bovine E1 also agree with the results of Khailova et al.(5Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) on pigeon breast E1. Thus, location of tryptophan residue(s) at or close to the TPP binding site may be a general feature of the active site of PDC E1s from higher organisms. Interestingly, E1 was not protected from inactivation when both TPP and pyruvate were added simultaneously. The formation of the charge transfer complex in the presence of TPP alone affords the protection against NBS modification of E1. The addition of pyruvate to holo-E1 has been shown to result in the disappearance of the charge transfer complex(5Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Severin S.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 573: 36-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which may explain the elimination of protection. The oxidation of bovine E1 with NBS produced an instantaneous decrease in absorbance at 280 nm with the transformation of the indole to oxindole chromophore (Fig. 4B). The maximal change in absorbance during the NBS titration can be used to determine the number of tryptophan residues oxidized(22Spande T.F. Witkop B. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 498-506Crossref Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows the concentration dependence for NBS modification of tryptophan residues in E1 and supports a stoichiometric reaction. At relatively low NBS/E1 molar ratio (40:1), 2 tryptophan residues/mol of E1 (α2β2) were oxidized. Based on the amino acid sequences of human E1α and E1β subunits, there are a total of 12 tryptophan residues in the tetrameric E1 (2 in α and 4 in β). Only 2 of the 12 tryptophan residues were modified by NBS under our experimental condition. Thus, a single tryptophan residue per subunit of bovine E1 appeared to be at or near the catalytic site. The number of essential tryptophan residues oxidized also correlates with the number of active centers of the enzyme(3Khailova L.S. Korochkina L.G. Biochem. Int. 1982; 5: 523-532Google Scholar). Table 1 provides results showing the extent of tryptophan modification in the absence and presence of different ligands. TPP (1 mM) alone caused almost complete protection of two tryptophan residues, but other combinations were ineffective in protecting the tryptophan residues from NBS modification (Table 1). The CD spectrum in the far ultraviolet region of the modified enzyme was essentially identical with that of the untreated enzyme (results not shown), indicating little or no significant change in secondary structure of the protein upon modification.Tabled 1 Our data using bovine E1 indicate that a single tryptophan residue per subunit (either in α and β) of E1 is protected by TPP. To isolate the peptide containing the active site tryptophan residue, recombinant human E1 was treated with NBS (0.25 mM) under similar conditions as were used for bovine E1. The extent of modification of tryptophan residue was quantitated from the decrease in absorbance at 280 nm. Complete loss of activity again correlated with the modification of a single active site tryptophan residue. TPP (0.4-1 mM) afforded 60-70% of protection against NBS modification of human E1 (results not shown). To locate this Trp residue, we employed differential peptide mapping following NBS inactivation of the human E1 in the presence and absence of TPP. After NBS modification, the enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC. The eluant from the HPLC column was monitored simultaneously at 220 and 280 nm. A typical chromatogram monitored at 280 nm is shown in Fig. 5. Detailed inspection of the chromatogram indicates that the peptide marked by plus sign eluting at 30% acetonitrile (at 60 min) was substantially protected by TPP. Other peptide peaks did not show any pronounced changes in the presence or absence of TPP. Since 2 mol of tryptophan were modified per mole of tetrameric E1 (Fig. 4B), the recovery of one tryptophanyl peptide as obtained is in accordance with the data above. The tryptophanyl peptide peak was collected and further purified by rechromatography on C-8 reverse phase column. This HPLC run provided only one major peak at 280 and 220 nm (results not shown). The peptide was concentrated and then sequenced. The peptide was expected to be very long, as judged from an HPLC elution profile and from the predicted trypsin cleavage sites. The peptide was sequenced for the first 15 amino acid residues. The sequence GPNGASAGVAAQHSQ matched completely with the sequence from 116 to 130 amino acid residues in human E1β, indicating tryptic cleavage occurred after Arg-115 in this protein. The next predicted trypsin cleavage site would be at Lys-143, giving rise to a peptide of 28 amino acid residues with only 1 tryptophan at 135. By a similar differential procedure, a peptide with the sequence AWYG was isolated from bovine E1 following V8 protease digestion. The sequence agrees with that around the same Trp in the human E1β subunit (cf. Fig. 6, discussed below). Although we are unable to explain the production of this peptide by V8 protease, this further supports the conclusion that it is this specific Trp of the E1β subunit, which is protected from modification by TPP. These results strongly support the contention that Trp-135 of E1β is involved in TPP binding. Amino acid sequences of the E1β subunit of PDC have been deduced from cDNAs isolated from human(8Ho L. Patel M.S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), rat(9Matuda S. Nakano K. Ohta S. Saheki T. Kawanishi Y-I. Miyata T. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. 1990; 191: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Comparison of the aligned sequences of these E1β subunits indicates that Trp-135 in human E1β is conserved among these proteins; amino acid residues surrounding the modified tryptophan are highly conserved (Fig. 6). Thus, this region may constitute a part of the enzyme active site. Because it has not been possible to isolate functionally active E1α and E1β separately, it is not known whether TPP binds to the α or the β subunit. A putative TPP binding motif as reported by Hawkins et al. (12Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) for TPP-dependent enzymes is found only in the E1α subunits of the α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. Based on the sequence similarities between E1β subunits of branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase and transketolase from several species, Zhao et al. (30Zhao Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. Crabb D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) have recently proposed that the E1β subunit may participate in TPP binding. X-ray crystallography studies of transketolase from S. cerevisiae have demonstrated that the TPP binding site is located in a deep cleft between the two subunits (homodimer), and residues(187-198) from both subunits interact with TPP(31Sundstrom M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies also revealed that the TPP binding site in transketolase is lined with several conserved amino acids such as His, Asp, Arg, Leu, and Ile(32Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Ermler U. Sundstrom M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). However, the identification and exact role of specific amino acid residue(s) in TPP binding of TPP-dependent enzymes is still unclear. This paper is the first evidence for the localization of a specific tryptophan residue in the E1β subunit at or near the TPP binding site in the TPP-dependent mammalian E1. We are thankful to Drs. Ganesh K. Kumar, Lioubov Korotchkina, and Joyce E. Jentoft of Case Western Reserve University for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript. We are indebted to Gary A.

Other residues outside the switch I region may also be required for the interaction with these proteins. Krev-1 (Rap1, smg p21), which is the product of a suppressor gene for transformation induced by an activated K-ras gene(32Kawata M. Matsui M. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol.

In particular, the amino acid sequence of Tyr32-Val44 in the Krev-1 protein is identical to the corresponding sequence in the Ras protein(32Kawata M. Matsui M. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18965-18971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M.

Therefore, the transforming activity requires other residue(s). A chimeric Ras protein, consisting of residues 41-60 of Krev-1, was devoid of transforming activity(35Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the putative effector residues are expected to exist in this region. To determine the effector residues essential for signal transduction, and to identify the binding sites for the putative target effectors, such as Raf-1 and GAP, we have performed mutational analyses of the Ras protein. We have previously prepared mutant Ras proteins with an amino acid residue replaced by the corresponding residue of the Krev-1 protein (Krev-1-type mutants; (36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and (37Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar). The Glu31→ Lys (E31K), V45E, and G48C mutants had no activity, and the N26G mutant was partially defective in a PC12 differentiation assay(36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 37Shirouzu M. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Ito Y. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar). The E31K, V45E, and N26G mutations also abolished the transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells(38Marshall M.S. Davis L. Keys D. Mosser S.D. Hill W.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1415-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the region Asn26-Gly48 was reported to be an extended effector region(40Marshall M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study, we prepared mutants in residues 42-55 and examined the effects of the mutations on the differentiation of PC12 cells. We also examined the affinity of GAP for these mutant proteins, and the activation of MAP kinase in PC12 cells. In addition, we compared these properties of the mutants with their abilities to bind the Raf-1 protein. Each mutation was introduced into synthetic human c-Ha-ras genes (41Miura K. Inoue Y. Nakamori H. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. J. Jpn. Cancer Res. (Gann). 1986; 77: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar) with and without the oncogenic Gly12→ Val (G12V) mutation, by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the Muta-Gene™ kit (Bio-Rad). The stable transfectant clones of PC12 cells harboring the ras gene with a Krev-1-type mutation on the oncogenic G12V background, or the v-raf gene, in the mammalian expression vector pMAM-neo (Clontech) were reported previously(36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 42Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shindo-Okada N. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2019-2024PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the newly prepared ras genes with a second mutation introduced on the G12V background (“V12 type”) was also subcloned into pMAM-neo. PC12 cells were transfected with DNA (5 μg) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and G418-resistant clones were selected. For each gene, three or more independent clones were obtained and used for the following experiments. Expression of the ras or v-raf gene in the PC12 cells was induced by addition of dexamethasone at the final concentration of 1 μM in the culture medium. After 24 h, the number of cells that have extended neurites was counted. MAP kinase activation was examined as described below, for the cells 8 h (unless otherwise noted) after the induction. The mutant Ras proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described, with the following modification(41Miura K. Inoue Y. Nakamori H. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Ikehara M. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. J. Jpn. Cancer Res. (Gann). 1986; 77: 45-51PubMed Google Scholar) : 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was used. The purified proteins were bound with GDP. To exchange the bound nucleotide from GDP to guanylyl-(β,γ-imido)diphosphonate (GMPPNP), the Ras protein (1 mg) was incubated with GMPPNP (0.2 μmol) and 1 mM EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. The free nucleotides were removed by ultrafiltration using centricon-10 units (Amicon). This cycle was repeated three times. By high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis, it was confirmed that 95% of the binding nucleotides were converted to GMPPNP. PC12 cells were replated 24 h before microinjection at a density of 1 × 105 cells/dish. We injected Ras mutants (10 mg/ml) in the GMPPNP-bound form into 100-200 cells using an injectoscope, model IMF-2 (Olympus). The Ras protein (0.3 nmol) was incubated with 1 mM EDTA and [8,5′-3H]GTP (0.28 nmol, 43.6 Ci/mmol) for 5 min at 37°C. Free nucleotides were removed by ultrafiltration, and the final concentration of Ras was adjusted to 3 μM. This solution of [8,5′-3H]GTP-bound Ras protein (25 μl) was mixed with purified recombinant rat GAP (0.01-2 μM) and incubated at 10°C. At different times, 5-μl aliquots were removed and boiled with 0.25% SDS and 5 mM EDTA. These mixtures were chromatographed on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Merck) in 0.5 M LiCl and 1 M formic acid. The radioactivities in the GTP and GDP spots were counted. From a semilogarithmic plot of the amounts of bound GTP versus time, the rates of GTP hydrolysis were obtained. After incubation of the Ras protein (2 μM) with [8,5′-3H]GDP or [8,5′-3H]GTP (2 Ci/mmol, 10 μM) in 450 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF for 10 min at 37°C, 2.5 μl of 1 M MgCl2 and 10 μl of 100 mM nonlabeled GTP were added to the solution. At different times, 100-μl aliquots were applied to nitrocellulose filters and washed five times with 2 ml of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM MgCl2. The radioactivities remaining on the filters were counted. PC12 cells (2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped with a scraper in 0.1 ml of an extraction buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 12 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 6 mM DTT, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate at 0°C. Homogenization and centrifugations were performed as described previously(43Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The supernatant was used as the cell extract. We used 10 μg of each extract per assay. The in-gel kinase assay was performed according to the method described previously(43Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Briefly, after electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing myelin basic protein (MBP), the SDS was removed by washing the gel with 20% 2-propanol. After denaturation with 6 M guanidine HCl and renaturation in a 0.04% Tween 40-containing buffer, the gel was incubated at 25°C for 1 h with 10 ml of 40 mM Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 25 μM [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/ml) for kinase reactions. The substrate protein for kinases, MBP (0.5 mg/ml), was added to the separating gel prior to the acrylamide polymerization. Experiments were performed at least three times with each transfectant. Cell extracts (25 μg/assay) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Western blots were probed with anti-ERK1 antibody 956/837 and visualized by using the ECL immunodetection system (Amersham Corp.). To identify the determinant residues responsible for the signal-transducing activity of Ras, we made a series of mutations in the amino acid residues on the C-terminal side (residues 42-55) of the switch I region of the human c-Ha-Ras protein. These residues are included in the antiparallel β-sheet that consists of the β2 and β3 strands of the Ras protein (Fig. 1). We have already prepared “Krev-1-type” mutants, with an amino acid residue replaced with the corresponding one of the Krev-1 protein, and have examined their neurite-inducing activity(36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, we substituted an alanine for each amino acid residue in this region (“alanine-scanning mutagenesis”). When the ras gene with an oncogenic mutation, Gly12→ Val (G12V), was expressed in PC12 cells, about 80% of the cells extended neurites (Fig. 2). We tested here the Ala mutations for their effects on the neurite induction by the G12V ras gene. Among the 15 mutations that we introduced on the G12V background in this study, we found that two mutations (K42A and L53A) completely diminished the neurite-inducing activity in PC12 cells; essentially none of the cells transfected with these mutant genes (V12 type) extended neurites (Fig. 2 and 3a). In addition, the I46A, G48A, and E49A mutations reduced the efficiency of neurite outgrowth down to 32, 45, and 17%, respectively, of the transfected cells (Fig. 3a). In contrast, other mutant ras genes induced neurite outgrowth for 80-95% of the PC12 cells. By Western blotting, it was confirmed that the neurite induction-deficient mutant proteins were expressed in PC12 cells to the same extent as the other mutant proteins (data not shown).Figure 3:The neurite-inducing activities of mutant Ras proteins. The numbers of PC12 cells that extended neurites were counted and are shown as percentages of the total number of cells. For each mutant, the value shown is the mean ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments with different transfectant clones. a, transfection with mutant ras genes (V12 type). b, microinjection with GMPPNP -bound mutant Ras proteins (G12 type).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have already reported that the V45E and G48C mutations abolished the neurite-inducing activity(36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the region bearing residues Lys42, Val45, Ile46, Gly48, Glu49, and Leu53 is now concluded to be essential for the neurite-inducing activity of Ras. The Ras protein is thought to transduce signals in the active GTP-bound form(44Satoh T. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4553-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There was a possibility that these inactive mutants could not interact properly with the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (45Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) and therefore failed to be converted to the GTP-bound form in the transfected cells. To test this possibility, we exchanged the bound nucleotide of the wild-type and K42A and L53A mutant proteins from GDP to an unhydrolyzable GTP analog, GMPPNP, and microinjected these proteins into PC12 cells (we used here the Ras proteins that have glycine at position 12 (G12 type)). As a result, 67% of the cells that were injected with the GMPPNP-bound wild-type Ras extended neurites. Microinjection of the GMPPNP-bound L53A mutant protein partially promoted neurite outgrowth, but the K42A mutant protein did not induce neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3b). We have already shown that the V45E and G48C mutants bound with GMPPNP had no neurite-inducing activity(36Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shirouzu M. Koide H. Nishimura S. Yokoyama S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We investigated the dissociation rates of guanine nucleotides from the mutants lacking the neurite-inducing activity. Ras proteins of the G12 type were used in this experiment. We measured the amounts of [3H]GTP or [3H]GDP bound to the Ras proteins after an incubation in the presence of Mg2+. As for the wild type, the dissociation rate was slightly higher for GDP than for GTP (Table 1). The nucleotide dissociation rates for the mutant proteins were very similar to those of the wild type, except for the L53A mutant. The GDP and GTP dissociation rates of the L53A mutant were 2.8- and 5.0-fold higher than those of the wild type, respectively. The effects of other mutations on the dissociation rates of guanine nucleotide were negligible.Tabled 1 To investigate the effects of mutations on GTPase activity, the G12-type Ras proteins were used. The intrinsic GTPase activities of the mutant proteins were similar to that of the wild-type Ras, except for the L52M/D54E mutant Ras, which had a 2-fold increased GTPase activity (Fig. 4a). Next, we investigated the GTPase activities in the presence of GAP. At 37°C, the GTPase activities of all the mutants in the presence of GAP were very similar to that of the wild type (data not shown). We then measured the GTP hydrolysis rates of mutant Ras proteins at 10°C in the presence of various concentrations of GAP. A plot of the results shows that the GTPase activity of 3 μM of the wild type is half-maximally increased by 0.20 μM GAP (Fig. 4b). The V45E mutant Ras protein had a 1.7-fold higher affinity with GAP, and the affinities of the I46A, G48A, and G48C mutant Ras proteins were reduced to half of that of the wild type (Fig. 4b). The GAP affinities of the other mutants were almost the same as that of the wild type. The fully GAP-enhanced GTP hydrolysis rates of all the mutants were similar to that of the wild type (0.74 min−1). As oncogenic ras genes activate MAP kinase in PC12 cells(7Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Burgge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 8Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether the MAP kinase was activated in PC12 cells that were induced to express a mutant Ras protein (V12 type). The in-gel kinase assay tests renatured MAP kinases for their abilities to phosphorylate the embedded MBP (43Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 5a. It should be noted here that the MAP kinase activation by Ras is much lower than that by nerve growth factor (NGF) as reported(8Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). So, by the in-gel kinase assay, it was impossible to analyze the band due to the p42 MAP kinase (ERK2) because of overlapping with an unidentified band. In contrast, the band of the p44 MAP kinase (ERK1) could clearly be distinguished. From the intensities of this band, therefore, we examined the abilities of the mutant Ras proteins to activate p44 MAP kinase in PC12 cells (Fig. 5a) as summarized in Table 2 in comparison with their neurite-inducing activities.Tabled 1 First, the K42A, V45E, G48C, and L53A mutations completely abolished the activation of p44 MAP kinase by Ras in the PC12 cells. In addition, the p44 MAP kinase activation was significantly diminished by the E49A mutation. Correspondingly, the neurite-inducing activity was completely impaired by the K42A, V45E, G48C, and L53A mutations and drastically reduced by the E49A mutation. In contrast, the other mutations, which did not affect the neurite-inducing activity, exhibited no effect on the p44 MAP kinase activation. Thus, as far as these mutations of Ras are concerned, the activation of p44 MAP kinase correlates well with the neurite-inducing activity. On the other hand, we could observe the activation of p42 MAP kinase by Western blotting detection of the phosphorylated, active form which migrates more slowly than the inactive form(8Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5b, the activation of p42 MAP kinase was certainly reduced by the K42A and E49A mutations, but not appreciably by the T50A and C51A mutations. Therefore, there is no significant difference, between the p42 and p44 MAP kinase species, in the effects of the Ras mutations on the activation in PC12 cells. In NIH 3T3 cells and COS cells, v-Raf has been reported to induce the activation of MAP kinase. To determine whether v-Raf activates p44 MAP kinase in PC12 cells, we utilized PC12 cells transfected by the v-raf gene(42Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shindo-Okada N. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2019-2024PubMed Google Scholar). For this stable transfectant, we have already reported that the induced expression of v-Raf resulted in neurite outgrowth(42Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Shindo-Okada N. Yokoyama S. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2019-2024PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it was also reported that a v-Raf expression failed to activate MAP kinases in PC12 cells, although it was unclear whether or not the transfectant cells exhibited v-Raf-dependent neurite outgrowth (8Wood K.W. Sarnecki C. Roberts T.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Fu"

Loss of this element resulted in drastically reduced β4 promoter activity in transfected cholinergic SN17 cells. Furthermore, this element specifically interacts with nuclear proteins prepared from both SN17 cells and adult rat brain. UV cross-linking experiments indicated the presence, in SN17 nuclear extracts, of a prominent protein species (approximately 50 kDa) that interacts specifically with the 19-base pair element. These results lead us to hypothesize that interactions between the 50-kDa protein and the novel 19-base pair element are necessary for transcriptional activation of the β4 subunit gene.

Characterization of the genetic events leading to the expression of specific neurotransmitter receptors is necessary for a thorough understanding of the complex communication mechanisms within the central nervous system.

Expression of ACh sensitivity is fundamental to the formation of neuromuscular synapses, and it has been shown that the increases in ACh sensitivity that occur in muscles following innervation are consequences of changes in the abundance and distribution of ACh receptors (reviewed in (1Schuetze S.M.

In addition, the ability of the α7, α8, and α9 subunits to form functional homomeric receptors has been demonstrated(13Schoepfer R. Conroy W.G. Whiting P. Gore M. Lindstrom J. Neuron. 1990; 5: 35-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 14Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.-M. Hernandez M.-C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M.

Boulter J. Patrick J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 589-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is likely, then, that the functional diversity exhibited by the neuronal ACh receptor family results from the differential expression and incorporation of different subunits into mature receptors. In support of this hypothesis, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that each of the ACh receptor subunit genes exhibits distinct, yet overlapping, temporally and spatially restricted patterns of expression in the peripheral and central nervous systems(3Sargent P.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 837-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, together with the functional studies, suggest specific molecular mechanisms for generating functional diversity in terms of cholinergic signal transmission within the nervous system. Despite these recent advances, the molecular details underlying the differential expression of the neuronal ACh receptor subunit genes remain largely unknown. Previous investigations indicated that regulation at the level of transcription plays a key role in the differential expression of ACh receptor subunits in the nervous system(30Bessis A. Savatier N. Devillers-Thiery A. Bejanin S. Changeux J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Daubas P. Salmon A.M. Zoli M. Geoffroy B. Devillers-Thiery A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These reports demonstrated that both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms are involved in the expression of neuronal receptor genes; however, specific transcriptional regulatory elements and associated factors have not been identified conclusively for any of the mammalian neuronal ACh receptor subunit genes. In our earlier studies aimed at identifying regulatory elements required for basal level and induced expression of the rat nicotinic ACh receptor β4 subunit gene, we reported the identification of cis-acting sequences within the β4 5′-flanking region capable of activating transcription of a reporter gene in transiently transfected nerve growth factor-stimulated PC12 cells(33Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a 19-base pair (bp) element in the β4 promoter region that, when deleted, resulted in a significant loss of reporter gene expression following transfection of a cholinergic cell line. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments of the 19-bp element were consistent with the transfection data and demonstrated that this element is necessary for high level expression of the β4 subunit gene. The 19-bp sequence specifically interacts in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with proteins present in nuclear extracts prepared from either a cholinergic cell line or adult rat brain. The DNA binding activity is also present, albeit in significantly lower abundance, in adult rat liver, lung, and kidney, while being completely absent in heart. Furthermore, ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking experiments indicated that the 19-bp element interacts with a DNA-binding protein with an apparent molecular size of 50 kDa. Interestingly, computer analysis of the 19-bp sequence suggests this to be a novel transcriptional regulatory element. Interactions of this novel element with its unidentified binding protein are potentially important for the establishment or maintenance of the cholinergic phenotype. We previously reported the generation of a rat β4/luciferase expression plasmid, pX1B4FH, containing a 226-bp FokI/HindIII fragment (spanning nucleotides −89 to +137, relative to the β4 transcription initiation site; (33Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The insert of this construct was excised and subcloned into Bluescript SK II+ (Stratagene) to yield pBLSKB4FH. Exonuclease III was used to generate two 5′-deletions of the FokI/HindIII fragment in pBLSKB4FH, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into the promoterless luciferase expression vector pXP1 (35Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar) to yield pX1B4D4 and pX1B4D18. pX1B4D4 contains a 200-bp fragment spanning nucleotides −63 to +137 while pX1B4D18 contains a 219-bp fragment spanning nucleotides −82 to +137 (sequences shown in Fig. 1). Synthetic oligonucleotides used in the EMSA and UV cross-linking experiments were obtained from a commercial source (Cruachem, Inc.). The 19-bp complementary oligonucleotides (sequence shown in Fig. 1) were annealed and then radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. SN17 cells (36Hammond D.N. Lee H.J. Tonsgard J.H. Wainer B.H. Brain Res. 1990; 512: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Approximately 24 h prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 105 cells/ml. Cells were transfected with 10 μg of test plasmid (β4 subunit promoter fragments fused upstream of the luciferase gene) and 5 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector, pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Transfections were performed using a modified calcium phosphate co-precipitation method(37Van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercially available kit (Promega Corp.) and an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (EG& Berthold). All transfections were done a minimum of three times with at least two preparations of plasmid DNA. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between dishes, luciferase activity in each sample was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity in that same sample. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a commercially available kit (Galacto-Light; Tropix, Inc.). Various tissues were dissected from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) and immediately used for preparation of nuclear extracts. SN17 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 150-mm dishes before harvesting. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Christy et al.(38Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford(39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217422) Google Scholar). EMSA (40Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar) were performed according to the method of Christy et al.(38Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (15 fmol) were incubated with various amounts of nuclear extract (as indicated in the figure legends) in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI•dC). Competition experiments were done with a 5-min preincubation of unlabeled, competitor, double-stranded oligonucleotides with nuclear extracts prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Electrophoresis of binding reactions was done through 6% polyacrylamide gels in low ionic strength buffer. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis of wild type pX1B4FH was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using a commercially available kit (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The sequence of the 5′-mutagenic oligonucleotide (nucleotides −82 to −64) was 5′-TTTGGATCCCTCTCAGACCCGACACGGCACGTTGA-3′ (top strand), and the sequence of the 3′ primer was 5′-GTTGTTGTCGACCCAGCTTCTGTG-3′ (bottom strand). The mutated bases are shown in bold type. The 5′ primer contains a BamHI site, and the 3′ primer contains a SalI site, which were used for directional cloning following PCR. Extra bases were added to the 5′ end of each primer to facilitate restriction enzyme digestion. The pBLSKB4FH plasmid was used as the template for the PCR amplification reactions. The PCR products containing mutations were purified, digested with BamHI and SalI, and ligated into the BamHI/SalI sites of the pXP1 vector to create pX1B4FHM. The mutations in pX1B4FHM were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (105 cpm) were incubated with SN17 nuclear extract in the presence of 2 μg of poly(dI•dC) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were irradiated with UV light in a Stratalinker® (Stratagene) for the indicated amounts of time. Proteinase K treatment was done with 1 μg (0.02 milliAnson unit) of enzyme at 37°C for 15 min following irradiation. Competition experiments were done with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled β4 oligonucleotide in the binding reaction prior to irradiation. The cross-linked species were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5% resolving gel), and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. We previously described the isolation of 226 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the rat β4 subunit gene and demonstrated the ability of this region to activate the expression of a luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected PC12 cells(33Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To further localize important transcriptional regulatory sequences within the β4 5′-flanking DNA, additional 5′-deletional analysis was carried out using the 226-bp FokI/HindIII genomic fragment present in pX1B4FH (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequences of two 5′-deletions, pX1B4D4 and pX1B4D18, are shown in Fig. 1. To determine the effect of these deletions on β4 promoter activity, transient transfections of the cholinergic cell line, SN17, were carried out (Fig. 2). SN17 cells were chosen for subsequent promoter studies as they are more receptive to CaPO4-mediated transient transfection relative to PC12 cells. Deletion of 7 bp from the 5′ end of the 226-bp FokI/HindIII fragment (to yield the construct, pX1B4D18) resulted in an approximately 30% drop in luciferase activity (compare the activities of pX1B4FH and pX1B4D18 in Fig. 2). Deletion of another 19 bp (to yield the construct, pX1B4D4) led to a 90% decrease in luciferase activity when compared to the full-length clone (see Fig. 2). These results indicate the presence of positively acting sequences within the 26 bp between the 5′ ends of pX1B4FH and pX1B4D4. Present within these 26 bp is a 5-bp element, CCCCT, directly repeated 2 times in the 19 bp between the 5′ ends of pX1B4D18 and pX1B4D4 (see Fig. 1). Since loss of this region resulted in a substantial decrease (90%) in reporter gene activity, the possible interaction of this 19-bp sequence with cellular factors was investigated. EMSA were used to determine whether nuclear extracts prepared from SN17 cells contain proteins that interact with the 19-bp element. Incubation of a radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the 19-bp sequence with an SN17 nuclear extract resulted in the formation of one prominent protein-DNA complex (arrow B in Fig. 3) and two less prominent complexes (arrows A and C in Fig. 3). Importantly, the amount of each complex increased with increasing protein concentration (Fig. 3), and specificity for the 19-bp sequence was demonstrated by EMSA in the presence of either unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the β4 19-bp sequence or to the binding sites for 3 general transcription factors, AP1, TFIID, and SP1. The results (Fig. 3) indicated that only the unlabeled β4 19-bp oligonucleotide was capable of interfering with radioactive DNA-protein complex formation, thereby demonstrating specificity of this protein complex for the 19-bp element. Overall, these experiments, carried out with independent preparations of SN17 nuclear extracts, indicated the presence in such extracts of a DNA binding activity that interacts specifically with the β4 19-bp element shown in transfection experiments to be required for β4 promoter activity. These results prompted further investigation into the possible co-expression of the β4 gene and this newly identified promoter binding activity. Earlier anatomical studies indicated the expression of the β4 subunit gene in discrete regions of the rat brain(18Duvoisin R.M. Deneris E.S. Patrick J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). More recent studies document the expression of the β4 gene in non-neural tissues such as the thymus (41Mihovilovic M. Denning S. Berrih-Aknin S. Roses A.D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993; 123: 13Google Scholar) and keratinocytes(42Pereira E.F.R. Albuquerque E.X. George P.G. Horton R.M. Conti-Tronconi B.M. Grando S.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 468: 12Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the DNA binding activity found in SN17 nuclear extracts is present in a more physiological context (coincides with β4 expression), EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts prepared from a variety of adult rat tissues. DNA binding activities were found to be in brain, liver, lung, and kidney with the activity being most abundant in brain (Fig. 4). There does not appear to be any DNA binding activity in heart nuclear extract. Interestingly, nuclear extracts from kidney contain a DNA binding activity that results in a distinct pattern of complexes when incubated with the β4 oligonucleotide (Fig. 4). This result has been seen in EMSA carried out with independent preparations of kidney nuclear extract; however, the significance of this observation remains to be elucidated. To confirm the functional significance of the 19-bp element, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. A mutant β4 promoter region was constructed in the context of the 226-bp FokI/HindIII fragment in which 9 of the 19 bp were altered (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transient transfections of SN17 cells with the wild type (pX1B4FH) and mutated (pX1B4FHM) promoter constructs indicated that mutation of the 19-bp element had a drastic effect on β4 promoter activity resulting in an approximately 70% decrease in activity (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the 19-bp region is critical for wild type β4 transcriptional activity, and, furthermore, that this region most likely interacts with transcriptional regulatory factors present in SN17 cells and various rat tissues. UV cross-linking experiments (43Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar) were carried out to estimate the size(s) of the protein(s) interacting with the β4 19-bp sequence. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of irradiated binding reactions revealed the presence of a single major cross-linked species with an apparent molecular size of 50 kDa (Fig. 6). The cross-linked protein was not observed when unlabeled specific β4 competitor was included in the binding reaction nor when the irradiated reaction mixture was treated with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 6). In addition, cross-linked species were not observed when nuclear extract was omitted from the binding reaction or when the binding reaction was not subjected to irradiation (Fig. 6). These data suggest that a 50-kDa protein present in SN17 nuclear extracts is capable of specifically interacting with the β4 19-bp sequence and further raise the possibility that this interaction is involved in the transcriptional activation of the β4 subunit gene. Although the analysis of transcriptional regulation of the neuronal nicotinic ACh receptor gene family is still in its infancy, the presence of both positive and negative regulation in the expression of the receptor subunit genes is clear(30Bessis A. Savatier N. Devillers-Thiery A. Bejanin S. Changeux J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Daubas P. Salmon A.M. Zoli M. Geoffroy B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Bessis et al.(30Bessis A. Savatier N. Devillers-Thiery A. Bejanin S. Changeux J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) recently reported the identification of a silencer element in the chick α2 subunit gene. This element is composed of six tandem repeats of an Oct-like motif (CCCCATGCAAT) but does not appear to interact with any member of the Oct family(30Bessis A. Savatier N. Devillers-Thiery A. Bejanin S. Changeux J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, if the tandem nature of the repeats was disrupted, the silencer activity was lost, and, further, if two, four or five of the motifs were deleted, the element actually enhanced transcription. The silencer element was shown by EMSA to specifically interact with at least one, and possibly two, nuclear proteins, the identities of which remain to be elucidated(30Bessis A. Savatier N. Devillers-Thiery A. Bejanin S. Changeux J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2185-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similarly, positive regulatory regions have been identified in the chick α2 (31Daubas P. Salmon A.M. Zoli M. Geoffroy B. Devillers-Thiery A. Bessis A. Medevielle F. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2237-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and α7 (32Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-45389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) subunit genes and the rat α3 subunit gene(34Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, specific DNA-protein interactions have not been demonstrated in any of these cases. The 19-bp regulatory element of the rat β4 subunit gene we have isolated does not exhibit significant homology with any of these positively acting transcriptional regulatory regions nor to the α2 silencer element, and therefore represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first characterized positive regulatory element within the mammalian neuronal nicotinic ACh receptor gene family. Computer-assisted comparisons of the β4 19-bp element with binding sites for known transcription factors did not reveal any significant homologies other than a 90% identity with the consensus binding site (“GC-box”) for the zinc finger transcription factor SP1(44Evans B.A. Richards R.I. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that SP1 may be involved in β4 subunit gene expression. However, our EMSA data (Fig. 3) demonstrate that an oligonucleotide corresponding to the SP1 consensus binding site does not compete with the β4 19-bp element for binding to proteins in SN17 nuclear extract, thus indicating this to be unlikely, at least in terms of the 19-bp sequence. Interestingly, the 5′-CCTCCCCTCCC-3′ sequence of the β4 19-bp element is found within the promoter regions of several eukaryotic genes encoding proteins known to play a variety of roles in neuronal development and differentiation. These genes include those encoding the γ subunit of the neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor (NGF; (45Watt R. Nishikura K. Sorrentino J. Ar-Rushdi A. Croce C.M. Rovera G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as well as the proto-oncogenes, c-myc(46Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and c-fos(47Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1991: 119-170Google Scholar). The binding of NGF to its high affinity receptor and the subsequent activation of a cellular program leading to neuronal differentiation has been well documented (see (48Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for review). Indeed, we have previously shown that NGF increases the transcriptional activities of β4/luciferase fusion genes in transfected PC12 cells (33Hu M. Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of the earliest events in the NGF-induced cascade are increases in the transcriptional activities of the c-myc and c-fos proto-oncogenes(48Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol.

The products of these two genes are involved in the expression of a number of genes leading ultimately to neuronal differentiation. It is interesting to speculate as to whether the 50-kDa polypeptide we have shown to interact with the β4 19-bp element also interacts with the NGF, c-myc, and c-fos promoter regions, and, consequently, is involved in the NGF-mediated regulatory cascade. As the nicotinic ACh receptor genes are members of the “late” class of NGF-induced genes(47Halegoua S. Armstrong R.C. Kremer N.E. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1991: 119-170Google Scholar), some mechanism must account for the differential temporal patterns of expression of the β4, NGF, c-myc, and c-fos genes. Further studies should help elucidate this mechanism and determine whether the CCTCCCCTCCC sequences in the NGF, c-myc, and c-fos genes are involved in transcriptional activation. The data presented in this report clearly indicate the presence in nuclear extracts prepared from SN17 cells, adult rat brain, liver, lung, and, to a much lesser extent, kidney, of a DNA binding activity that interacts with the β4 19-bp element. As UV cross-linking experiments revealed the existence of a single protein species interacting with the 19-bp element, it is reasonable to propose that the multiple shifted complexes observed in the EMSA are consequences of interactions between the 19-bp sequence and the 50-kDa protein in either a homomeric or heteromeric manner. The identities of the 50-kDa protein and any possible binding partner(s) remain unknown but are the focus of current studies. The presence of DNA binding activities in non-neural tissues was, at first glance, surprising given that β4 subunit gene expression was initially thought to be limited to specific neurons(18Duvoisin R.M. Deneris E.S. Patrick J. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggest a more ubiquitous expression pattern for the β4 gene with β4 mRNA being detected in cells such as thymocytes (41Mihovilovic M. Denning S. Berrih-Aknin S. Roses A.D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1993; 123: 13Google Scholar) and keratinocytes(42Pereira E.F.R. Albuquerque E.X. George P.G. Horton R.M. Conti-Tronconi B.M. Grando S.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 468: 12Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the β4 gene may not be expressed exclusively within the nervous system. This leads us to speculate that the DNA binding activity we observed in the EMSA may represent the binding of a more general transcription factor (as opposed to a neuronal-specific factor) to the β4 promoter and that cell type-specific expression of the β4 gene product may result from the interaction of this potentially general transcription factor (the 50-kDa protein) with a non-DNA-binding heterodimer partner expressed in a more specific fashion. This possibility awaits further investigation. In summary, we have identified a novel 19-bp, positively acting, transcriptional regulatory element within the 5′-flanking region of the rat nicotinic ACh receptor β4 subunit gene. This element, as determined by 5′-deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, is necessary for full transcriptional activation by the β4 promoter. Specific DNA-protein interactions between this element and proteins present in nuclear extracts prepared from a variety of sources were detected in EMSA. Importantly, a nuclear protein with apparent molecular size of 50 kDa was demonstrated to bind the 19-bp sequence, thus raising the possibility that interactions between the 19-bp element and the 50-kDa polypeptide are necessary for complete transcriptional activation of the β4 subunit promoter. Further characterization of the binding protein(s) that interact with the 19-bp element should provide considerable insight into the molecular mechanisms governing β4 subunit gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1998762260,"We previously reported the purification and characterization of the polyhedrin promoter-binding protein (PPBP), an unusual DNA-binding protein that interacts with transcriptionally important motifs of the baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter (S. Burma, B. Mukherjee, A. Jain, S. Habib, and S.E. Hasnain, J. Biol. Chem.(1994) 269, 2750-2757. PPBP also exhibits a sequence-specific single-stranded DNA-binding activity. Gel retardations and competition analyses with double- and single-stranded oligonucleotides indicated that PPBP binds the coding strand and not the noncoding strand of the promoter. This was further confirmed by UV cross-linking and Southwestern blotting experiments. Gel retardations with mutated oligonucleotides indicated that both dsDNA and ssDNA binding involve common AATAAATAAGTATT motifs. However, ssDNA binding is dependent upon ionic interactions unlike dsDNA binding, which is mainly through nonionic interactions. The affinity of PPBP for the coding strand appears to be higher than that for duplex promoter DNA. Interestingly, the PPBP-coding strand complex has a longer half-life (∼60 min) than the PPBP-duplex promoter complex (∼15 min). PPBP represents a unique example of an “initiator” promoter-binding protein with dual dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities, and this reconciles very well with the unusual binding characteristics displayed by it. The formation of the PPBP-coding strand complex in vivo may be a crucial step for the exceptionally high and repeated rounds of transcriptional activity of the baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter. We previously reported the purification and characterization of the polyhedrin promoter-binding protein (PPBP), an unusual DNA-binding protein that interacts with transcriptionally important motifs of the baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter (S.

PPBP represents a unique example of an “initiator” promoter-binding protein with dual dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities, and this reconciles very well with the unusual binding characteristics displayed by it. The formation of the PPBP-coding strand complex in vivo may be a crucial step for the exceptionally high and repeated rounds of transcriptional activity of the baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter. In the baculovirus expression vector system, the very late polyhedrin gene promoter of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus is used to direct the expression of foreign genes (Luckow, 1991; Jarvis and Summers, 1992; O'Reilly et al., 1992). Although the baculovirus expression vector system is widely used for heterologous gene expression, little is known about the regulation of the polyhedrin promoter and the mechanism responsible for hypertranscription from this promoter. The polyhedrin promoter of the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus consists of a 69-base pair region (−1 to −69) just upstream of the ATG start codon (Matsuura et al., 1987; Possee and Howard, 1987; Rankin et al., 1988). The transcription start point (at −50) lies within a highly conserved TAAGTATT motif that is absolutely essential for transcription initiation (Ooi et al., 1989). Morris and Miller(1994) have recently shown that an 18-base pair region surrounding the transcription start point (−42 to −59) is sufficient for “minimal” promoter activity, whereas the sequences encoding the untranslated mRNA leader are required for the very late burst of expression. The structure of the polyhedrin promoter is, therefore, similar to that of certain eukaryotic TATA-less promoters where the initiator (the sequence around the transcription start site) acts as a minimal promoter capable of directing basal levels of transcription (Smale and Baltimore, 1989). We previously reported (Burma et al., 1994) the identification and characterization of a 30-kDa host factor, the polyhedrin promoter-binding protein (PPBP). 1The abbreviations used are: PPBPpolyhedrin promoter-binding proteinssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNA. The transcriptionally essential TAAGTATT sequence is important for PPBP binding in association with an AATAAA motif present just upstream from it (Fig. 1), which is known to be important for promoter activity (linker scan mutations affecting the AATAAA motif decreased promoter activity by about 65% (Ooi et al., 1989)). The minimal promoter described by Morris and Miller (1994) consists essentially of these two hexa- and octanucleotide motifs. PPBP was purified from Sf21 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cell line and appeared to be an unusual DNA-binding protein with respect to its stability, high binding affinity, and high specificity. The correlation of functional promoter sequences and the factor-binding site argues that the interaction of PPBP with the polyhedrin promoter may be an important event in the initiation of transcription from this promoter. We proposed that PPBP might function in a manner analogous to the TATA-binding protein in recruiting the virus-specific RNA polymerase and/or trans-acting factor(s) to the polyhedrin promoter. polyhedrin promoter-binding protein single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA. The unusual structure of the polyhedrin promoter (with the initiator acting as the minimal promoter) and the binding characteristics of PPBP involving the transcription start point poses the problem of whether binding would be maintained even after the melting of DNA at this point during transcription initiation. We, therefore, carried out experiments to investigate whether PPBP exhibits any single-stranded DNA-binding activity. Such an activity would allow PPBP to maintain its position when the DNA helix melts during the initiation of transcription. We show here that in addition to binding duplex promoter DNA, PPBP binds the coding strand but not the noncoding strand of the promoter in a sequence-specific manner involving common cognate motifs. Unlike duplex-promoter binding, ssDNA binding appears to involve ionic interactions. Furthermore, the affinity of PPBP for the coding strand of the promoter is higher than that for duplex promoter DNA. Interestingly, the PPBP-coding strand complex has a longer half-life (∼60 min) compared with the PPBP-duplex promoter complex (∼15 min). These features of PPBP may have important implications in the regulation of hypertranscription from the polyhedrin promoter. Sf21 cells were maintained in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (O'Reilly et al., 1992). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared using a modification of the method of Dignam et al.(1983) as described earlier (Burma et al., 1994). Synthetic oligonucleotides were labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. 2 μg of crude nuclear extract was incubated at 25°C for 15 min with 1 ng of dsDNA or 0.5 ng of ssDNA (∼104 cpm) in the presence of 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)] in a final volume of 20 μl (Chodosh, 1988a). The DNA-protein complex was resolved by electrophoresis at 4°C in a 5% (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. For competition experiments, an appropriate amount of unlabeled ssDNA or dsDNA was added to the reaction mixture. The binding reaction was carried out as described above. After 15 min the incubation mixture was placed on ice and UV-irradiated (254 nm) at a distance of 1 cm for 30 min (Chodosh, 1988b). Following irradiation, the mixture was electrophoresed in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. All operations were carried out at 4°C. 50 μg of nuclear extract was fractionated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris and 190 mM glycine for 16 h at 30 mA. The filter was first incubated with blocking buffer (2% nonfat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 16 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) for 2 h and then incubated with binding buffer (blocking buffer with 0.2% nonfat dry milk) containing labeled ssDNA or dsDNA (∼106 cpm/ml) for 16 h, washed, and subjected to autoradiography (Burma et al., 1994). Oligonucleotides corresponding to a 32-base pair region of the polyhedrin promoter (−63 to −32) (Fig. 1) encompassing the 18-base pair minimal promoter (Morris and Miller, 1994) and bearing the PPBP-cognate motifs (Burma et al., 1994) were chemically synthesized, annealed, radioactively labeled, and used in gel retardation assays. The PPBP-dsDNA complex obtained (Fig. 2A, lane 2) could be competed out with a 30-fold excess of cold double-stranded promoter DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and also with a 30-fold molar excess of the coding strand (Fig. 2A, lane 5) but not with the noncoding strand (Fig. 2A, lane 6) of the promoter. Nonspecific dspUC18 DNA or sspUC18 DNA (generated by heating and quick cooling dspUC18) could not compete for complex formation (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 7, respectively). These results indicated that PPBP also binds the coding strand but not the noncoding strand of the promoter. Gel retardations and cold competition assays with the labeled coding or noncoding strand of the promoter (Fig. 2B) revealed that the former elicited a complex similar to that obtained with duplex promoter DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The complex obtained could be competed out with a 30-fold excess of unlabeled coding strand DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 3) but not with a similar excess of the noncoding strand or sspUC18 DNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). The complex could also be competed out with a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled duplex promoter DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 6) but not by a similar excess of dspUC18 DNA (Fig. 2B, lane 7). The ability of the coding strand to compete for the complex obtained with duplex promoter DNA (Fig. 2A, lane 5) and vice versa (Fig. 2B, lane 6) confirmed that the same factor, PPBP, can bind both dsDNA and ssDNA. The labeled noncoding strand did not show any evidence of complex formation in a gel retardation assay (Fig. 2B, lane 9), even after prolonged exposure of the film. The observation that PPBP had a distinct preference for the coding strand rather than the complementary noncoding strand validated that the binding of PPBP to the coding strand is sequence-specific. Before proceeding further, it was important to exclude the possibility that the observed dsDNA binding reflected binding to a small population of denatured DNA molecules. Double-stranded probes prepared individually by labeling either the coding strand (Fig. 2C, lane 2) or the noncoding strand (Fig. 2C, lane 3) formed identical complexes regardless of which strand was labeled. Since the noncoding strand did not bind, no complex formation should have been observed in lane 3, where the coding strand was not labeled, if the observed dsDNA binding was caused by denaturation of the double-stranded probe. Thus, double-stranded DNA binding activity truly represented binding to duplex DNA structure rather than to contaminating single strands. To characterize the relationship between the ssDNA and dsDNA binding activities of PPBP, UV cross-linking and Southwestern assays were performed with double-stranded and single-stranded probes. The DNA-protein complex was UV-irradiated (254 nm) for 30 min in the presence or absence of competitor DNA. After separation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography (Fig. 3A) it was apparent that the molecular mass of both of the binding activities was about 30 kDa. A cross-linked complex with an expected mass of about 30 kDa (Burma et al., 1994) was obtained with labeled double-stranded promoter DNA (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The cross-linked complex was not obtained with labeled noncoding strand DNA (Fig. 3A, lane 2) or when the labeled coding strand was irradiated alone in the absence of nuclear extract (Fig. 3A, lane 3). A 30-kDa cross-linked band was obtained upon irradiation of the PPBP-coding strand complex (Fig. 3A, lane 4). Complex formation was greatly reduced in the presence of an excess of cold coding strand or duplex promoter DNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 8) but was unaffected in the presence of an excess of cold noncoding strand DNA or sspUC18 DNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively), thereby demonstrating the specificity of the cross-linked complex. Southwestern analyses of the nuclear extract, using radiolabeled duplex promoter, coding strand, or noncoding strand as probe, was carried out to confirm the molecular mass of the dsDNA/ssDNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts were fractionated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed (Fig. 3B). A common band was obtained in the 30-kDa region when the blots were probed with labeled duplex promoter DNA or ssDNA corresponding to the coding strand (Fig. 3B, panels a and b, respectively). The band was specific since it did not appear when a similar blot was probed with noncoding strand DNA (Fig. 3B, panel c). These results reinforced the idea that the same factor, PPBP, displayed both of these binding activities. An octanucleotide motif (TAAGTATT) present at the transcription start point and a hexanucleotide motif (AATAAA) present immediately upstream of the octanucleotide (Fig. 1) are essential for PPBP binding (Burma et al., 1994). Mutated versions of the coding strand, mutOct-c (TAAGTATT substituted with GCCTGCGG) and mutHex-c (AATAAA substituted with CCGCCC), were used in gel retardation assays (Fig. 4). No binding was observed with labeled mutOct-c or mutHex-c (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), indicating that both of these motifs are essential for ssDNA binding (Fig. 4, lane 1). A complementary experiment, where the complex formed by the labeled wild type coding strand (Fig. 4, lane 4) could be competed out with an excess of cold wild type coding strand DNA (Fig. 4, lane 5) but not with the mutated versions of the same (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7), confirmed the involvement of the octa/hexa motifs (essential for ds DNA binding) in ssDNA binding also. There have been reports of sequence-specific binding of single-stranded nucleic acids by heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (Wilusz and Shenk, 1990; Kumar et al., 1986). Nuclear extracts (2 μg) were pre-treated with 2 μg of proteinase K or 2 μg of pancreatic RNase at 37°C for 60 min and assayed for dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities by gel retardation. Proteinase K abolished both dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5), whereas RNase treatment did not affect DNA binding in any way (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 6). Thus, dsDNA/ssDNA binding by PPBP does not involve any RNA component. PPBP can bind duplex promoter DNA over a very wide salt range, i.e. 200-2000 mM NaCl (Burma et al., 1994). Since complex formation was not affected by such a wide fluctuation in NaCl concentration, it appeared that the dsDNA-PPBP association was predominantly through nonionic interactions. Surprisingly, we found that the interaction of PPBP with the coding strand showed lower levels of salt tolerance (Fig. 6A). PPBP could bind to the coding strand only at salt concentrations ranging from 200 to 500 mM NaCl (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). Complex formation was greatly reduced at 1 M NaCl (Fig. 6A, lane 3) and was abolished at 2 M NaCl (Fig. 6A, lane 4). Therefore, it appears that ssDNA binding, unlike dsDNA binding, is dependent on ionic interactions. Divalent cations are not required for dsDNA binding (Burma et al., 1994). Divalent cations are also not required for ssDNA binding as evident from the observation (Fig. 6B, lane 2) that the addition of 100 mM EDTA did not affect complex formation in any way. A competition analysis was performed to directly assess the relative affinities of dsDNA and ssDNA binding by PPBP. Binding reactions (with labeled coding strand DNA) were performed in the presence of graded amounts of cold coding strand or duplex promoter DNA (0.25-4-fold excess). Bound probe was analyzed by the gel retardation assay (Fig. 7, inset). Relative amounts of bound material were quantitated by phosphor image analysis (Bio-Rad GS-250 molecular imager) and plotted (Fig. 7) as % maximal binding ((amount bound in presence of competitor/amount bound in absence of competitor) × 100). The coding strand-PPBP complex was competed to half-maximal binding by ∼2-fold lower molar quantities of coding strand DNA, compared with duplex promoter DNA (evident from three independent experiments). The half-life of a DNA-protein complex is usually determined by challenging a preformed complex of protein and labeled probe with an excess of unlabeled probe (Choo and Klug, 1993). In this method the dissociated protein is trapped in a new nonradioactive complex and thus prevented from rebinding to the probe. The decay of radioactivity in the original complex as a function of time would then reflect the half-life of the complex. Preformed dsDNA-PPBP (Fig. 8, panel a) or ssDNA-PPBP complexes (Fig. 8, panel b) were challenged with an excess of cold duplex promoter or coding strand DNA, respectively, and reactions were loaded onto a running gel over a time period ranging from 0 to 60 min. The decay of radioactivity in the original complexes was quantitated by phosphor-image analysis, and % maximal binding was plotted against time (Fig. 8). The half-life of the dsDNA-PPBP complex was estimated to be only ∼15 min, whereas that of the ssDNA-PPBP complex was ∼60 min. A knowledge of the factors interacting with the polyhedrin gene promoter and the mechanism of such interactions is a prerequisite for understanding polyhedrin promoter activation. Seven Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genes (lef-1 to lef-7) are now known to be involved in expression from the very late polyhedrin promoter (Li et al., 1993; Passarelli and Miller, 1993a, b, c; Morris et al., 1994). 2A. L. Passarelli and L. K. Miller, submitted for publication. However, it is not known whether the lef gene products act at the level of replication, transcription, or translation. To date, PPBP is the only factor known to directly interact with the polyhedrin promoter. Given the unusual structure of this promoter, its temporal pattern of activation, and the exceptionally high levels of polyhedrin gene expression it was pertinent to investigate the interaction of PPBP with the promoter. The structure of the polyhedrin promoter is similar to that of certain eukaryotic promoters where the initiator is capable of acting as the minimal promoter. The unique structure of such promoters is believed to be necessary for directing transcription of a subset of genes that require strict activation and inactivation during cellular differentiation and development (Smale and Baltimore, 1989). The structure of the polyhedrin promoter might ensure the very late pattern of polyhedrin gene expression in a similar manner. Although several initiator-binding proteins have been identified (Weis and Reinberg, 1992), the pathways for the assembly of transcription complexes at such promoters remain to be worked out, and it is not known whether these alternate pathways require the standard set of basal factors for initiation (Buratowski, 1994). Because of its position, the initiator element is susceptible to DNA melting very early in the transcription initiation process (Goodrich and Tjian, 1994). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that key initiator-binding factors must possess dual dsDNA/ssDNA binding activities that would enable them to maintain their positions at the initiator irrespective of the double- or single-stranded state of the DNA. Crick(1971) published a model for chromosomes of higher organisms in which “the recognition sites needed for control purposes are mainly unpaired single-stranded stretches of double-stranded DNA” and hypothesized that sequence-specific ssDNA binding proteins would be found and would play an important role in gene regulation. Reports have indicated that regulatory regions of chromatin may be sensitive to nuclease S1 (Larsen and Weintraub, 1982; Johnson et al., 1988), indicating the presence of ssDNA. Surprisingly, there have been few well documented reports of ssDNA binding transcription-regulatory proteins. Examples of transcription factors with dual dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities are even more limited: (i) the estrogen receptor selectively binds the coding strand of an estrogen receptor element (Lannigan and Notides, 1989); (ii) muscle factor 3 and MyoD interact with double- and single-stranded forms of muscle gene elements (Santoro et al., 1991); (iii) sterol regulatory element-binding factor recognizes both double-stranded and single-stranded forms of a sterol regulatory element, SRE-1 (Stark et al., 1992); (iv) the yeast α1 and MCM1 proteins bind either single-stranded or duplex DNA representing their cognate upstream activation sequence (Grayhack, 1992); (v) complex formation of nuclear proteins with repeated elements in the external transcribed spacer of Cucumis sativus ribosomal DNA does not depend upon the single- or double-stranded state of the DNA (Zentgraf and Hemleben, 1992); and (vi) oviduct nuclear proteins binding to the steroid-dependent regulatory elements of the chicken ovalbumin gene prefer ssDNA in a sequence-specific manner (Nordstrom, 1993). To our knowledge, PPBP is the first example of a “core” promoter-binding protein with dual dsDNA and ssDNA binding activities. There are three possible hypotheses to explain how a protein might bind both duplex and single-stranded DNA: (i) the protein might exclusively contact bases on one strand of the DNA. Such a protein might either impart on the ssDNA a conformation similar to that of the same strand in the duplex state or confer a distinct conformation to both dsDNA and ssDNA; (ii) the protein might recognize a common secondary structure formed by both dsDNA and ssDNA; or (iii) the protein might possess two domains, one recognizing dsDNA and the other recognizing ssDNA. Binding to ssDNA could then be caused by either a sequence-specific ssDNA binding domain or the combined action of a nonspecific ssDNA binding domain and the sequence-specific dsDNA binding domain, which retains some base-specific contacts in the cognate motif. It is important to reiterate here the observed differences in the kinetics of ssDNA and dsDNA binding. It is possible that, in vivo, PPBP initially binds to the duplex promoter. Following transcription initiation and “open complex” formation, PPBP would bind more tightly and stably to the coding strand of the promoter. Thus, PPBP can maintain its position at the transcription start point in spite of DNA melting. Experiments described by Mollegaard et al.,(1994) suggest that DNA melting might enhance promoter recognition by RNA polymerase. Therefore, PPBP could keep the promoter region single-stranded after the polymerase has passed in the elongation process and, thereby, enhance the next transcription round. Thus, the formation of the PPBP-coding strand complex may be a crucial step for repeated rounds of transcription to take place and could, perhaps, explain the exceptionally high levels of polyhedrin gene expression observed. Regulatory proteins are likely to interact with the transcription apparatus by looping, bending, twisting, and unwinding of DNA to bring the two sets of proteins into alignment (Ptashne, 1988). Thus, proteins like PPBP that tolerate structural changes in DNA may be able to regulate transcription more efficiently (the polyhedrin promoter is exceptionally hyperactive very late in the viral infection cycle). Indeed, ssDNA represents more structural pliability, as well as a greater number of contact points for specific DNA-protein interactions. Achieving the high sequence specificity necessary to accurately control gene expression in eukaryotes may thus be made easier by the use of such interactions. Therefore, it may be tempting to cite PPBP as another example where eukaryotic transcriptional activation is controlled not only by the more canonical transcription factors that bind dsDNA motifs but through another level of control, which involves regulatory proteins with dual double- and single-stranded DNA binding activities.

https://openalex.org/W2086313380,"Previously, we identified an arylphorin-binding protein of Sarcophagaperegrina (flesh fly) with a molecular mass of 120 kDa and suggested its participation in the selective uptake of arylphorin from the hemolymph into the pupal fat body at metamorphosis (Ueno, K., and Natori, S.(1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12107-12111). This paper reports the isolation and sequencing of cDNA for the 120-kDa protein. This protein consists of 1146 amino acid residues. Immunoblotting and RNA blotting experiments revealed that this protein is present as two fragments of 76 kDa (695 residues) and 53 kDa (451 residues) in the larval fat body. When larvae pupate, the 120-kDa protein gene is further activated and the complete 120-kDa protein is synthesized without fragmentation. This suggests a novel mechanism for the production of the 120-kDa protein regulated by a proteinase depending upon the stage of development of Sarcophaga. All of these proteins were found to be localized in protein granules in the adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2046316155,"Cellular retinoic acid-binding protein type II (CRABP-II) is one of two small molecular weight, cytosolic proteins which specifically bind retinoic acid (RA). Crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies of several related proteins have indicated that either one or two conserved amino acid residues, homologous to positions Arg111 and Arg132 of CRABP-II, are important for the binding of the hydrophobic ligand. In this report we have prepared site-directed mutations of these two positions of CRABP-II, Arg111 and Arg132, as well as Lys82 to determine the role of these residues in the binding of RA. Recombinant wild type and mutant CRABP-II proteins were expressed and purified, and the affinity for retinoids was determined by fluorometric titration and binding of 3H-labeled compounds. K82A displayed an identical Kd for all-trans-RA as wild type CRABP-II and the Kd for all-trans-RA of R111A was only slightly higher. On the other hand, the two Arg132 mutants, R132A and R132Q, of CRABP-II demonstrated undetectable binding of all-trans-RA.

Taken together these data demonstrate that Arg132 is a critical amino acid residue for the binding of RA by CRABP-II.

The actions of RA have been suggested to be mediated by two classes of proteins. The first is the family of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR-α, RAR-β, and RAR-γ) (2Giguere V. Ong P. Segui P.

The RARs and RXRs, which belong to the multigene family of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, are RA-inducible transcriptional regulatory proteins which transduce the RA signal by altering the rate of transcription of specific genes (for review, see (8Mangelsdorf D.J.

The second class consists of the small, cytoplasmic proteins (CRABP-I and CRABP-II) (for review, see (9Ong D.E. Newcomer M.E. Chytil F. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 283-317Google Scholar). The function of these proteins is unclear. Although it is not known whether the CRABPs are necessary for RA action, it has been suggested that they play an important role in sequestering RA within the cell and directing the metabolism of bound RA(10Boylan J.F.

However, human and mouse CRABP-I display 73% amino acid sequence identity with human and mouse CRABP-II, respectively. CRABP-I and CRABP-II specifically bind RA while having no detectable affinity for either retinol or retinal(13Bailey J.S. Siu C.H. J. Biol.

Both CRABP-I and CRABP-II display similar ligand binding properties for RA and several of its metabolites; however, CRABP-II appears to have a 3-fold lower affinity for stoichiometrically binding retinoids when compared to CRABP-I(13Bailey J.S.

Finally, during embryogenesis both CRABP-I and CRABP-II are widely expressed; however, in the adult the expression of CRABP-II becomes restricted to the skin(14Giguere V. Lyn S. Yip G. Siu C.H.

CRABP-II belongs to a large superfamily of low molecular weight, cytoplasmic, small hydrophobic molecule-binding proteins often referred to as lipid-binding proteins (LBPs). The crystal structures of several LBPs including CRBP-I(21Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), CRBP-II(22Winter N.S.

All of the LBPs whose structures have been determined contain 10 antiparallel β-strands arranged in two orthogonal β-sheets and two short α-helices. Either one or both of the residues at the homologous positions to Arg111 and Arg132 of CRABP-II are involved in ligand binding. No crystallographic information is presently available for either CRABP-I or CRABP-II. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of CRABP-I have demonstrated that replacement of either Arg111 or Arg132 (homologous to the Arg111 and Arg132 of CRABP-II) with Gln results in a significantly lower affinity for RA, suggesting that these two residues are involved in interacting with the ligand(30Zhang J. Liu Z.-P. Jones T.A. Gierasch L.M. Sambrook J.F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 13: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this report we have examined the role of the two conserved Arg residues, Arg111 and Arg132, of CRABP-II for binding of RA. Our studies demonstrate that mutation of Arg132 of CRABP-II to either an Ala or a Gln results in markedly decreased binding of all-trans-RA and no acquisition of all-trans-retinol binding when compared to that of the wild type protein. On the other hand, mutation of Arg111 of CRABP-II to an Ala resulted in a near wild type affinity for all-trans-RA. Taken together these data suggest that Arg132 is critical for the binding of RA by CRABP-II. The mouse CRABP-II cDNA clone was generously provided by Dr. Vincent Giguere, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, as a full-length cDNA encoding mouse CRABP-II cDNA in pBluescript KS vector (pKSmcrabp-II) (14Giguere V. Lyn S. Yip G. Siu C.H. Amin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6233-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Four mutants of wild type CRABP-II were prepared in which Lys82 was replaced with an Ala (K82A), Arg111 was replaced with an Ala (R111A), Arg132 was replaced with an Ala (R132A), and Arg132 was replaced with a Gln (R132Q). The mutants were prepared by PCR site-directed mutagenesis(31Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purchased from the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory at Temple University School of Medicine or Ransom Hill Biosciences, Inc. Sense primers are indicated as s, antisense primers as as, and the mutant codon of the mutagenic primers in bold and underline. EcoRI-linearized pKSmcrabp-II was used as a template for preparation of the wild type and mutant constructs. For K82A, two PCR fragments were synthesized using the primer pairs CRABPII-5s (5′-CCGCCGGATCCTAACTTTTCTGGCAAC-3′) plus K82A-as (5′-TTTCACCAAACTGGCACAGGGTCTCCC-3′) and CRABP-II-3as (5′-GGGAGGGTGCAGGTACCCGGGCTTAAGATAAA-3′) plus K82A-s (5′-GGGAGACCCTGTGCCAGTTTGGTGAAA-3′), respectively. The two PCR fragments were purified, annealed, and amplified in a second PCR reaction using the primers CRABPII-5s and CRABPII-3as. The amplified DNA was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI digested pRSETB (Invitrogen). The remaining mutants were prepared in exactly the same manner except that the mutagenic primers for R111A were R111A-as (5′ GGTCAGTTCAGCGCTCCAGGA 3′) and R111A-s (5′-TCCTGGAGCGCTGAACTGACC 3′), for R132A were R132A-as (5′- TCGGACGTAGACGGCGGTGCACACAAC 3′) and R132A-s (5′-GTTGTGTGCACCGCCGTCTACGTCCGA 3′), and for R132Q were R132Q-as (5′ TCGGACGTAGACCTGGGTGCACACAAC-3′) and R132Q-s (5′- GTTGTGTGCACCCAGGTCTACGTCCGA- 3′). Wild type CRABP-II was subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pRSETB after PCR amplification using the CRABPII-5s and CRABPII-3as primers followed by digestion of the DNA product with BamHI and EcoRI. Since enterokinase was found to be inactive when a Pro was near the cleavage site, Pro1 of CRABP-II was changed to Leu. Wild type P1L was prepared by PCR amplification of EcoRI-digested pKSmcrabp-II DNA utilizing the primer pairs, P1L-s (5′-GCGCGAGATCTTAACTTTTCTGGCAACTGG-3′) and CRABPII-3as. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BglII and EcoRI and subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pRSETB. The mutants were prepared by replacing the PstI/ApaI fragment of each with that of the Leu1 wild type DNA. Each clone was verified by DNA sequence analysis of all the nucleotides encoding the entire fusion protein by Sanger methodology (32Sanger F. Coulson A.R. Barrell B.G. Smith A.J.H. Roe B.A. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) using Sequenase Version II. No codon mutations were found in the entire CRABP-II fusion protein coding sequences of each construct except for the desired mutations. The wild type and mutant plasmid expression vectors were transformed into Escherchia coli K12 strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen)(33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). A single colony picked from a freshly streaked plate was used to inoculate 100 ml of 2 × YT broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Sigma) and grown overnight at 37°C. The next morning, 20 ml of this culture were used to inoculate 10 liters of 2 × YT broth that contained the same antibiotics as above. The fermentation was carried out at 37°C in a MF-14 Microferm fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) until the A600 of the culture reached approximately 0.6. At this time the cells were induced to express the recombinant protein by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.6 mM. Ninety min later the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min, and the cell pellet was stored at −80°C. The cell pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl) containing 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a concentration of 1 g of cell paste/10 ml of buffer. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The cells were sonicated for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 60 min. The clear supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column (2 × 14 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After applying the sample, the column was washed extensively first with sonication buffer, pH 8.0 (approximately 1.6 liters), followed by sonication buffer, pH 6.0 (approximately 500 ml). The recombinant CRABP-II fusion protein was eluted from the column with sonication buffer, pH 4.0. Fractions were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The CRABP-II fusion protein fractions were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mM EDTA to remove any Ni+2 associated with the protein followed by dialysis against 50 mM bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% sodium azide and stored at a concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml at 4°C. Purity of protein was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)(34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using crystalline bovine serum albumin as the standard. For cleavage of the CRABP-II fusion proteins, aliquots of each fusion protein were dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and then incubated with 1:50 w/w enterokinase (Biozyme) for 10 h at 37°C. Efficiency of cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE. After completion of the digestion, the leader sequence and any uncleaved fusion protein was removed by batch treatment with the Ni-NTA resin followed by dialysis overnight against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol using dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut off of 3500. The protein concentration of the cleaved protein was then determined as described above. The recombinant apoCRBP-I (35Levin M.S. Locke B. Yang N.C. Li E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17715-17723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which was used as a positive control in the retinol binding studies was a generous gift of Dr. William S. Blaner, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York. An SLM DMX-1000 fluorometer equipped with an integrator was used with emission and excitation slit widths of 5 nm. Various concentrations of the all-trans isomer of RA or retinol prepared in ethanol were added to approximately a 1 μM solution of protein in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, such that the final ethanol concentration did not exceed 1% (v/v). The following molar absorption coefficients were used to calculate the retinoid concentrations of the stock solutions: RA, 45,000 M-1 cm-1 at 350 nm; retinol, 46,000 M-1 cm-1 at 325 nm(36Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Protein quenching was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 nm and 340 nm, respectively. At least 10 concentrations of each retinoid were used. The averages of three readings, with each value determined by the integrator over 8 s, were used for all calculations. Calculations of Kd were performed by the method of Cogan et al.(36Cogan U. Kopelman M. Mokady S. Shinitzky M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fraction of free binding sites on CRABP-II (α) was determined from α = (F - Fmax)/(F0 - Fmax), where Fmax = fluorescence intensity upon saturation of all the apoprotein molecules, F = fluorescence at each R0 (retinoid concentration), and F0 = initial fluorescence intensity. A straight line with a slope of 1/n and an ordinate intercept of Kd/n is obtained when P0α is plotted versusR0(α/1 - α), where P0 = total CRABP-II concentration and R0 = retinoid concentration. Each Kd value represents the mean ± S.D. of a minimum of three independent determinations utilizing at least two different batches of each protein. The binding of all-trans-[3H]RA and all-trans-[3H]retinol was performed essentially as described by Siegenthaler et al.(37Siegenthaler G. Saurat J-H Hotz R. Camenzind M. Merot Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 86: 42-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in the dark. For the binding assay, 50 or 100 nM fusion CRABP-II proteins (see figure legends) and 10 nM cleaved CRABP-II proteins in the binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol) was incubated with various concentrations of all-trans-[3H]RA (DuPont-NEN; 47.5 Ci/mmol) or all-trans-[3H]retinol (DuPont-NEN; 37.3 Ci/mmol) ranging from 5 to 500 nM at 25°C for 90 min. After incubation, an aliquot was removed for determination of total radioactivity and the remaining solution was mixed with an equal volume of charcoal dextran suspension (1.6% charcoal, 0.16% dextran T70, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5). After 15 min of incubation at 4°C, the tubes were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were counted for radioactivity in a Beckman LS 6000BC liquid scintillation counter. Specificity of binding was demonstrated by competition with 200-fold excess unlabeled all-trans-RA or all-trans-retinol. Background radioactivity was determined by preparing duplicate samples except for the addition of protein. Specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the background binding. The Kd values were determined by Scatchard plot analysis (38Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1946; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) using Cricket graphics. Each Kd value represents the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations utilizing at least two different batches of each protein. To identify amino acid residues of CRABP-II important for RA binding, we have focused our attention on two highly conserved Arg residues, Arg111 and Arg132. Both residues either singly or together have been demonstrated to be important for ligand binding by the LBPs(21Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1980; 143: 161-178Crossref Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). We have also chosen to examine another positively charged amino acid, Lys82, which is conserved among family members but has not been implicated in ligand binding by these proteins. Crystallographic analysis of a family member, P2 myelin protein, indicates that Lys81 (homologous position to Lys82 in CRABP-II) is located in the βF strand at top of the barrel on the opposite side of the fatty acid binding pocket (Arg106 and Arg126 of P2 myelin protein)(21Cowan S.W. Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1225-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the role of each of these positively charged amino acids in the binding of RA by CRABP-II, we chose to mutate each to the neutral amino acid, Ala. Since R132A did not display any measurable binding of RA (as shown below), we also mutated this amino acid residue to Gln to determine if we could alter the retinoid specificity of CRABP-II (see below). Wild type CRABP-II cDNA and four mutant cDNAs (K82A, R111A, R132A, and R132Q) were prepared in the prokaryotic expression plasmid, pRSETB. This expression vector encodes a Ni+2 binding site which facilitates purification of the fusion protein and an enterokinase cleavage site. The codon for Pro1 of CRABP-II was cloned in frame directly adjacent to the codons for the enterokinase cleavage site. This resulted in the production of a fusion protein containing a 3000-dalton leader peptide at the amino-terminal end of CRABP-II. Fig. 1A shows a representative gel demonstrating the expression and purification of the CRABP-II fusion proteins. All fusion proteins were efficiently produced in E. coli after the addition of IPTG (compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, the CRABP-II fusion proteins were recovered in the supernatant (greater than 90% for wild type and each mutant except R111A in which only approximately 30% was recovered in the supernatant) (Fig. 1A, lane 3) and each of the fusion proteins were readily purified by affinity chromatography over Ni-NTA (Fig. 1, A, lane 4, and B). The purity of all protein samples was estimated to be greater than 95% by SDS-PAGE. The yield of each recombinant CRABP-II fusion protein was approximately 5 mg/liter except for the R111A which was always lower (approximately 0.5 mg/liter) principally due to loss of protein in the cell pellets. The affinity of wild type and mutant CRABP-II fusion proteins for all-trans-RA was determined by two independent methods. Fig. 2A shows the quenching of fluorescence of wild type and mutant CRABP-II fusion proteins at 340 nm upon addition of increasing amounts of all-trans-RA. Measurement of the fluorescence spectra of the wild type and mutant fusion apoproteins upon excitation at 280 nm revealed very similar spectra with λmax at 340 nm for each protein (data not shown). The fluorescence of wild type and K82A CRABP-II fusion proteins decreased similarly upon addition of increasing amounts of all-trans-RA until the ligand binding site of each was saturated. At saturation, the binding of all-trans-RA quenched the fluorescence of the two proteins approximately 70%. The fluorescence of R111A fusion protein was also quenched upon addition of all-trans-RA to approximately 60% of the initial fluorescence intensity. In contrast, the addition of all-trans-RA to the two Arg132 mutant fusion proteins, R132A and R132Q, resulted in only a minimal amount of fluorescence quenching. Fig. 2B depicts the linearization of the data from Fig. 2A which allows for the calculation of the Kd for all-trans-RA and the number of independent binding sites. Approximately 1 (0.97-1.01) independent binding sites for all-trans-RA were observed for each of the wild type, K82A, and R111A fusion proteins, similar to previously published data(13Bailey J.S. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9326-9332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fiorella P.D. Giguere V. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21545-21552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd for all-trans-RA of wild type and K82A CRABP-II fusion proteins was identical, 106 ± 3 nM, while the R111A mutant demonstrated a slightly reduced affinity for all-trans-RA with a Kd value of 159 ± 4 nM. On the other hand, for both of the two Arg132 mutants, the minimal fluorescence quenching observed resulted in a large degree of scatter in the linear least squares plots (R2 = 0.08) making it impossible to calculate from the fluorescence data Kd value for all-trans-RA. To confirm the results from the fluorometric titration assay, we have measured the binding of all-trans-[3H]RA to wild type and each of the mutant CRABP-II fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, the fusion proteins for wild type CRABP-II and the two mutants, K82A and R111A, demonstrated saturable and specific binding of all-trans-RA, while both the R132A and R132Q fusion proteins showed no specific binding. Scatchard analysis of these data yielded a Kd value for all-trans-RA of 109 ± 10 nM, 119 ± 11 nM and 148 ± 14 nM for wild type, K82A, and R111A fusion proteins, respectively, and no detectable binding for either of the two Arg132 mutants. In summary, two independent methods of assessing the binding of all-trans-RA to wild type and mutant CRABP-II fusion proteins yielded essentially the same results. It should be noted that the Kd value of wild type CRABP-II fusion protein was slightly higher than that of 65 nM reported for rat pup CRABP-II (13Bailey J.S. Siu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9326-9332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 14 nM for mouse recombinant CRABP-II(17Fiorella P.D. Giguere V. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21545-21552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is most likely due to the presence of the extra 3000-dalton leader peptide associated with our fusion protein. We next prepared cleaved wild type, R111A, R132A, and R132Q CRABP-II proteins to ensure that the leader sequence was not responsible for the inability of the two Arg132 mutant proteins to bind all-trans-RA and to assure that the fusion protein portion of R111A did not mask any reduction in the affinity of this protein for RA. In our initial experiments we were unable to cleave the leader peptide because the first amino acid of CRABP-II directly adjacent to the enterokinase cleavage site was Pro. In order to cleave the leader sequence, we mutated Pro1 to Leu1 in the wild type and each of the mutant cDNA constructs. It should be noted that the Kd values for all-trans-RA of wild type CRABP-II and the mutant fusion proteins indicated in Figure 2:, Figure 3: were obtained using the Pro1 proteins. However, exactly the same results were obtained when Pr"

AChE exists in multiple molecular forms, conveniently classified as either asymmetric (A) or globular (G)(1Massoulié J. Bon S. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 1982; 5: 57-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Much information is available concerning the molecular biology, structure, and distribution of these forms of AChE, but little is known regarding the biosynthetic steps involved in their folding and assembly. Most research on AChE assembly has involved use of primary muscle cultures or cell lines(2Lazar M. Salmeron E. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3703-3713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 4Rotundo R.L. J.

Studies involving recovery of AChE activity after application of irreversible AChE inhibitors or in the presence of heavy-atom precursors(2Lazar M. Salmeron E. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

Whereas globular dimers and tetramers of AChE are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum, A forms of the enzyme are assembled in the Golgi apparatus(3Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Brockman S.K. Usiek M.F. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1201-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Not all catalytically active subunits are destined for incorporation into the more complex oligomeric forms; substantial amounts of catalytically active AChE are degraded(4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol.

The simpler active forms of AChE are, in turn, derived from a pool of inactive precursors. The existence of a large, catalytically inactive pool of subunit monomers and dimers has been demonstrated in cultured chick muscle (4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol.

The inactive molecules are, however, organized as monomers and dimers which closely resemble their active counterparts in physicochemical parameters(13Chatel J.-M. Eichler J. Vallette F.M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Grassi J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that such inactive pools become activated by an as yet unidentified mechanism or that much of their content is destined for destruction(2Lazar M. Salmeron E. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3703-3713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol.

It is possible that subpopulations exist within the inactive pool(s) and that both pathways are followed(2Lazar M. Salmeron E. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

The reason for the lack of catalytic activity of the inactive pool of AChE is not known. Although it does not require any covalent modification or processing, AChE does not acquire its catalytic activity immediately after biosynthesis(2Lazar M. Salmeron E. Vigny M. Massoulié J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3703-3713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Walker C.R. Wilson B.W. Neuroscience. 1976; 1: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), possibly because it is a large polypeptide, and its active conformation, with its correct arrangement of disulfide bonds, is not immediately realized. Thus, incomplete or incorrect folding may be a possible explanation for the presence of inactive enzyme. Although the three-dimensional structures of many proteins, including AChE(15Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar), have been solved, only limited information is available regarding the pathways used by these polypeptides to achieve their native configurations in situ. For many years, it was widely accepted that the information required for the realization of a protein's final structure is contained in its primary structure(16Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). However, when one takes into the account the efficiency and time required for protein folding in vitro, it is clear that protein folding and related processes must be directed processes within the cell(17Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 591-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the concept of self-folding and assembly has been challenged recently by the identification of molecular chaperones. These are a group of proteins which aid in protein assembly by mediating the folding of polypeptides and, in some cases, assist their assembly into oligomers, yet are not part of the final structure (cf. 18, 19). Chaperones may enhance proper folding, protect against undesired modes of folding, or interact with existing protein aggregates(19Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 20Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Among the elements shown to act as chaperones are several heat shock proteins (HSPs), highly conserved proteins expressed by organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to man, in response to heat or other forms of stress(21Morimoto R. Tissi è res A. Georgopoulos C. Morimoto R. Tissi è res A. Georgopoulos C. Stress Proteins in Biology and Medicine. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990: 1-36Google Scholar). Cells constitutively express proteins highly homologous to the HSPs, and it is assumed that these proteins fulfil chaperone functions under normal growth conditions(22Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3385-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In order to investigate a possible role for HSPs, acting as molecular chaperones, in the folding and assembly of AChE, we examined the effect of heat shock on AChE activity in chick muscle primary cultures. Chick muscle cultures represent the model of choice for such studies since the kinetics of AChE synthesis, degradation, oligomerization and transport are well documented in this system(4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19398-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M.

An initial examination of the effects of heat shock on AChE activity in chick myocultures has already been reported(24Eichler J. Toker L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present article, characterization of those AChE molecules affected by heat shock is presented. 12-day-old, fertilized white Leghorn chick eggs were obtained from Kfar Bilu Hatcheries (Kfar Bilu, Israel). Horse serum and penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin were supplied by Biotek Industries (Jerusalem, Israel) and Biological Industries (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel), respectively, while gelatin was from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Anti-proteolytic agents (aprotinin, bacitracin, benzamidine, EDTA, leupeptin, pepstatin A), bovine serum albumin, catalase, cycloheximide, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Acetylcholine (ACh) iodide, [3H]DFP, and Na[125I] came from Amersham (Buckingham, United Kingdom). Concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose, ConA-agarose, and underivatized Sepharose beads were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden), while wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-agarose and ricin I agglutinin (RCA)-agarose came from BioMakor (Rehovot, Israel). All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Primary pectoral muscle cultures were prepared from 12-day-old chick embryos as described previously(24Eichler J. Toker L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In some cases, cultures were subjected to a 45°C heat shock by replacing the culture medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, preheated to 45°C, followed by transfer to an incubator set at that temperature. 45 min later, culture medium was replaced with 37°C medium containing 10% horse serum and 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis(7Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the cultures were returned to a 37°C incubator. Cultures were washed with 3 × 5 ml of cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), on ice, to reduce AChE secretion. Cells were scraped, collected, and pelleted. The pellet was homogenized in a glass homogenizer in 100 μl of AChE extraction buffer (1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1 mM benzamidine, 1.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.0). The homogenate was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 10 min) in a Beckman airfuge. AChE activity in the supernatant was determined radiometrically (see below). Inhibition of myoculture AChE was achieved by first washing the cultures with 3 × 5 ml of HBSS on ice and incubating with 10-4M DFP in HBSS, at room temperature, for 20 min. Under such conditions >95% inhibition of AChE activity is achieved(6Wilson B.W. Walker C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cultures were then rinsed with 4 × 10 ml of HBSS to remove free DFP. Medium was reapplied to the cultures, which were then returned to the incubator. 6-day myocultures were subjected to a 45-min heat shock, returned to 37°C in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and then extracted at 5-10-min intervals in a volume of 400 μl of borate extraction buffer (1 M NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM benzamidine, 1 mg/ml bacitracin, 1.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 5 mMN-ethylmaleimide, 20 mM sodium borate, pH 9.0)(3Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For lectin binding studies, 100-μl aliquots were incubated with 40 μl of ConA, WGA, or RCA conjugated to either Sepharose or agarose beads or with underivatized Sepharose beads, all previously washed in AChE extraction buffer, together with 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MnCl2, in a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture was rocked gently overnight at 4°C, following which the beads were precipitated and AChE activity remaining in the supernatant was determined radiometrically. The presence of inactive AChE molecules was detected using an immunoradiometric assay, as described previously(13Chatel J.-M. Eichler J. Vallette F.M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Grassi J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified mAbs (10 mg/ml) were nonspecifically adsorbed to the walls of plastic tubes (Immuno Maxisorp Startube, Nunc) by incubation in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, for 5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C (final volume 200 μl). The immobilized antibody was either mAb C-131, which retains only molecules containing active AChE subunits, or mAb C-6, which retains all AChE molecules, including those lacking catalytic activity(10Chatel J.-M. Grassi J. Frobert Y. Massoulié J. Vallette F.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2476-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were saturated by 1 ml of coating buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.4 M NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN3, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Before use, the tubes were rinsed with 1 ml of coating buffer. The tubes were then incubated with 100 μl of the analyzed fraction, together with 100 μl of a saturating concentration of a second 125I-labeled purified monoclonal antibody, one which recognizes both active and inactive AChE species, in coating buffer, for 6 h at RT or overnight at 4°C. Next, the tubes were washed twice with 1 ml of rinse buffer (0.05% Tween 20, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) and radiometrically counted to determine the level of AChE protein present. Solid-phase bound AChE activity was revealed by addition of 1 ml of Ellman's reagent to the tubes(25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar), which were then vigorously agitated. AChE activity was then determined as described below. AChE activity was determined either colorimetrically on ATCh (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar) or radiometrically on [3H]ACh(26Johnson C.D. Russell R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture for the Ellman determination contained 1 mM 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.01% gelatin, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 and 0.5 mM ATCh. The reaction mixture for the radiometric assay contained 3 mM [3H]ACh, 1 mM MgCl2/100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cell extracts (100 μl) were deposited onto 5-20% (w/v) sucrose gradients prepared in 1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 and centrifuged using a SW41 rotor in a Beckman L8-70 ultracentrifuge (38,000-40,000 revolutions/min, 21 h, 4°C)(27Lyles J.M. Silman I. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1979; 33: 727-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients were determined by comparison with beef liver catalase (11.4 S), included in the gradients as an internal standard. 200-μl fractions were collected and tested for enzymic activity colorimetrically (see above). Results presented in an earlier study showed that both the transient reappearance of AChE activity during prolonged heat shock, and the permanent recovery subsequent to transient heat shock, occurred faster than might be expected from the rates of de novo synthesis(24Eichler J. Toker L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These experiments could not, however, exclude some contribution of de novo synthesis to the reappearance. To examine this possibility, 6-day-old chick pectoral muscle cultures were subjected to a 45°C heat shock for 45 min, and then returned to 37°C, in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. At 5-min intervals, plates were extracted and their AChE content determined radiometrically. As shown in Fig. 1, over 30% of the activity found in control cultures was lost as a result of heat stress. Activity remained at this reduced level for 10 min, after the cultures had been returned to 37°C. Within the next 5 min, a rapid recovery in AChE activity was observed. In fact, immediately after reversal of the loss in AChE activity induced by heat shock, the level of activity transiently exceeded, by ∼10%, that found in control cultures not exposed to heat stress. Cultures experiencing a constant heat stress of 45°C in the presence of cycloheximide were able to maintain their AChE activity levels for the first 20 min, after which a rapid loss of activity occurred (not shown). In order to characterize the population of AChE molecules involved in the rapid recovery of activity observed subsequent to a 45-min heat shock, the lectin binding ability of the AChE content of the cultures was examined at 5-min intervals. It had previously been shown that in myocultures, glycosylation of AChE molecules and, consequently, recognition by the appropriate lectins, occurs in a stepwise manner, reflecting transit of the enzyme through the secretory machinery(3Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recognition by ConA is achieved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while WGA only binds to AChE that has passed into the cis-Golgi, and RCA only recognizes enzyme which has passed into the trans-Golgi(3Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these lectins were used to determine the extent of processing and hence the location, within the secretory pathway, of the AChE molecules involved in the observed recovery from heat shock. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 2A. At all time points tested, ConA-Sepharose was able to precipitate over 80% of the AChE activity present. Within the first 15 min after removal of heat stress, however, both WGA and RCA were able to precipitate a higher percentage of AChE activity than under control conditions (control levels corresponding on average to 35% in the case of WGA and 20% in the case of RCA). After 15 min, corresponding to the period of time needed for recovery of AChE activity, binding by these lectins returned to or dropped slightly below control levels. Thus, during the period of elevated binding of AChE activity by WGA and RCA, corresponding to the period of heat shock-induced loss of AChE activity, enzyme that had passed into the Golgi apparatus and had acquired complex glycosylation accounted for a larger proportion of the AChE content of the cultures than is the case in control cultures. Recovery of AChE activity was accompanied by a restoration of binding of WGA and RCA to control levels. This return of WGA and RCA binding to normal levels is due to the appearance of a pool of AChE molecules which have yet to undergo complex glycosylation, and would not, therefore, be recognized by either WGA or RCA. This suggests that the AChE molecules affected by heat shock and subsequently responsible for the observed recovery of activity are found in the ER. Indeed, if the levels of activity precipitated by the various lectins immediately after heat shock and after return of AChE activity to control levels (15 min later) are expressed in terms of units of activity rather than as percentages of control levels, the increased contribution of ConA-binding, ER-localized AChE molecules to the total enzymatic activity of the cultures can be seen clearly (Fig. 2B). To further support the hypothesis that the pool of AChE involved in the recovery from heat shock had yet to transit the Golgi complex, cultures were first treated with DFP, an organophosphate which irreversibly binds to the enzyme's active site, thereby irreversibly inhibiting almost all (>95%) pre-existing AChE activity(6Wilson B.W.

Since de novo recovery of AChE activity following DFP inhibition occurred at a rate of ∼30%/h, such an approach permitted monitoring of movement through the secretory pathway of AChE synthesized de novo(4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19398-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Eichler J. Toker L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After removal of excess DFP, cultures were allowed to recover for 30 min and subjected to heat shock for 35 min. After return to a 37°C environment, in the presence of cycloheximide, the activity and lectin-binding properties of the AChE in the cultures were determined at 5-min intervals. It had been previously shown that, from the onset of their biogenesis, AChE molecules in chick muscle cultures require 90 min for transport to the trans-Golgi, where they acquire glycosylation that can be recognized by RCA(4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19398-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, during the 65 min from the onset of de novo synthesis until extraction of enzyme was performed, the newly synthesized AChE molecules had yet to reach the trans-Golgi. This was confirmed by lectin precipitation experiments, which showed that RCA binding only occurred 25 min later or 90 min after the onset of de novo AChE synthesis. ConA was able to recognize AChE at all time points after heat shock. Determination of the enzymic activity of the cultures subsequent to heat stress showed the characteristic recovery of activity soon after their return to 37°C (Fig. 3). This experiment supports the thesis that the AChE molecules responsible for recovery of activity after heat shock have yet to transit the Golgi or to achieve their final glycosylation. Again, this supports our contention that these molecules are found in the ER. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was employed to determine which molecular forms of AChE in chick muscle cultures were affected by heat shock (Fig. 4). Fig. 4, A and B, shows profiles of AChE activity after heat shock and after recovery from heat shock, respectively. Heat shock leads to a decrease in the activity of the G1 and G2 molecular forms, whereas G4-AChE is not substantially affected by heat shock (control not shown). Recovery from heat shock leads to an increase in the activities of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the enzyme (compare Fig. 4A and B). Indeed, integration of the areas under the peaks corresponding to the G1 and G2 molecular forms from both heat-shocked and recovered cultures shows that the activities associated with these molecular forms had increased ∼30 and 45%, respectively, whereas the G4 peak had increased only 6%. Furthermore, the profile of enzyme activity observed after recovery from heat shock resembled that of control cultures (not shown), showing that no redistribution of molecular forms of AChE had occurred as a result of heat shock. The recovery in AChE activity observed subsequent to heat shock could represent recovery of the activity of mature existing enzyme lost as a result of the heat stress; alternatively, this recovery might reflect heat shock-induced activation of a pool of inactive AChE molecules, since, as shown in Fig. 1, de novo synthesis is not involved in the restoration of AChE activity. Pools of inactive AChE molecules have been described in various systems, including chick myocultures, where they were localized to the ER(4Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19398-19406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chatel J.-M. Eichler J. Vallette F.M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Grassi J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of inactive AChE was responsible for the observed recovery from heat shock-induced loss of AChE activity, the following experiment was performed. Cultures were heat-shocked in the presence of DFP and allowed to recover at 37°C in the presence of cycloheximide. In this protocol, >95% of pre-existing AChE activity was inhibited, and de novo synthesis of new AChE molecules subsequent to heat shock should be prevented. Thus, any AChE activity detected should be due to the activation of pre-existing inactive AChE molecules. Determination of AChE activity subsequent to removal of the heat stress revealed a slight increase in enzymatic activity, corresponding to 10% of that present in normal cultures (not shown). Heat shockinduced activation of pre-existing inactive AChE molecules thus appeared to be insufficient to account for the recovery of enzymatic activity observed following removal of heat stress. These results were confirmed in a second experiment in which cultures were again subjected to heat stress in the presence of DFP. This time, however, the cultures were allowed to recover at 37°C in the presence of cycloheximide together with [3H]DFP. In this way, any newly activated AChE would incorporate the radiolabeled DFP. The level of radioactivity associated with cultures which had experienced heat shock was not significantly different from that of the appropriate control (not shown). These experiments cannot, however, discount the possibility that inactive as well as active AChE molecules bind DFP. If this were the case, the full extent of heat stress-induced activation of inactive AChE would be masked, due to binding of DFP to inactive AChE. Accordingly, a second approach was employed to examine the response of inactive AChE to heat shock: use of an immunoradiometric assay capable of distinguishing between active AChE molecules and total AChE protein (13Chatel J.-M. Eichler J. Vallette F.M. Bon S. Massoulié J. Grassi J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of inactive AChE to the total enzyme pool were compared in control cultures which had never experienced heat shock and in cultures which had been allowed to recover from heat shock in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 5). In this way, the possible involvement of inactive AChE molecules in the observed recovery of activity subsequent to heat shock was examined, independent of inhibitor binding properties. Recovery from heat shock was accompanied by ∼10% decrease in the relative amount of inactive AChE, presumably due to activation of AChE in the inactive pool. The magnitude of this presumed activation appears, however, to be insufficient to account for t"
https://openalex.org/W2089743237,"The developmentally regulated Pit-1 transcription factor is involved in the activation of prolactin, growth hormone, and TSHβ expression. Using templates with spacing mutations to program an in vitro transcription system, the activity of a single Pit-1 proximal binding site within the rat prolactin promoter was shown to have a unique bimodal distance requirement. Transcription activity rapidly decreased with each 5-base pair (bp) addition to the spacing between the binding site and the TATA box. When positioned 20 bp upstream from its normal −36 position in the prolactin promoter, the activity of the Pit-1 binding site is reduced to basal levels. Placement of the site at a position 30 bp upstream resulted in a return of Pit-1-mediated activation. Using transient transfection assays in GH3 cells, the prime bimodal sites are also a requirement for optimum expression of chimeric prolactin-luciferase reporter constructs. Interestingly, optimal synergism of transcription in vivo by the prolactin distal enhancer, containing four Pit-1 binding sites and an estrogen-responsive element, is also sensitive to the placement of the proximal Pit-1 binding site. These data have important implications for Pit-1 activator function in pituitary cells and for general models of transcription synergism."

Telomeres consist of long double-stranded stretches of G-rich repeat sequences including 5′-T2AG3-3′, which is found in vertebrates, and 5′-T4G4-3′, which is found in ciliates. In some organisms, 12-16-nucleotide single-stranded extensions of the G-rich strand have been documented at the telomere end(1Henderson E.R. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell.

Molecular clones for telomere end-binding proteins have been isolated from Oxytricha nova and Stylonychia mytilis(11Gray J.T. Celander D.W. Price C.M. Cech T.R.

However, the identification of telomere end-binding proteins in higher eucaryotes is a more formidable task due to the relatively low abundance of these ends. Mammalian, avian, and Xenopus cell extracts contain single-stranded DNAbinding activities that recognize telomeric oligonucleotide probes(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14McKay S.J. Cooke H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15McKay S.J. Cooke H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The detection of these binding activities in cell extracts from diverse species indicates that the telomeric nucleoprotein structures may be highly conserved throughout evolution. However, it is difficult to know with certainty whether the telomeric probe-binding activities detected in higher eucaryotes represent true telomeric proteins or whether they have entirely different functions within the cell. Recently, Ishikawa et al.(17Ishikawa F. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4301-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and McKay and Cooke (14McKay S.J. Cooke H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) reported that single-stranded telomeric probe-binding activities detected in HeLa cell and mouse liver extracts represent abundant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins that may function in pre-mRNA splicing and in chromosome capping. In view of these findings, it may be desirable to elucidate the nucleic acid recognition properties of a putative telomere-binding protein to determine whether these properties are consistent with the hypothesis that the factor can occupy sites of altered DNA structure under physiological conditions. Based upon these measurements, an initial assessment can be made about whether a telomeric probe-binding activity can potentially occupy sites at chromosome ends in vivo. Previously, we identified a potent single-stranded DNA-binding activity, referred to as MF3, that specifically recognized telomeric and non-telomeric sequences(18Santoro I.M. Yi T. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). High affinity binding occurred with probes containing two or more single-stranded stretches of guanine residues that were capable of G•G base pairing(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we report that a single guanine N-2 group is essential for factor binding, and this critical amino group can occur at any of the three guanine positions within the internal repeat. This nucleic acid specificity indicates that MF3 could bind to G-rich regions of altered DNA structure, such as telomere ends, or to abundant cellular RNAs, which form a multitude of structures containing non-canonical base pairs. To test the latter possibility, the RNA analogs of high affinity DNA-binding sites were tested for their ability to bind to MF3. The RNA probes did not form specific nucleoprotein complexes with MF3. The lower affinity for RNA appears to result from the presence of the 2′-hydroxyl on the ribose ring and not from differences in pyrimidine structure (i.e. uracil versus thymidine). A mathematical analysis is presented that accounts for nonspecific binding to nucleic acids, including RNA, and evaluates the ability of MF3 to occupy specific sites of G-rich regions of altered DNA structure in vivo. These calculations indicate that the nucleic acid recognition properties of MF3 are consistent with the hypothesis that it can function bybinding to telomere ends or other sites of unusual DNA structure within the genome. To remove bulk protein and endogenous nucleic acids from the telomeric probe-binding activity, MF3 was partially purified from a number of sources including the breast and thigh muscle of day 12-14 embryonic chickens, nuclear extracts of adult turkey erythrocytes as described previously(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), or nuclear extracts of Jurkat cells. Embryonic tissue extracts were typically made in standard buffer consisting of 10% glycerol, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, and a 1 μg ml-1 concentration of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim). Tissues were disrupted with ultrasonic vibration at 4°C using a Branson sonifier at settings 3-5 with a 1/2-inch tip, and the homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Cell extracts were applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the telomere-binding activity was eluted with a step gradient from 550 to 800 mM NaCl. Nuclear extracts of turkey erythrocytes were prepared as described by Evans et al.(19Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The activity was partially purified by sequential chromatography through columns of DEAE-Sepharose (Sigma) and heparin-Sepharose. The nuclear extract was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column, and the telomere-binding activity was eluted by a step gradient from 150 to 400 mM NaCl. These active fractions were applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, and MF3 was eluted with a step gradient from 500 to 850 mM NaCl. Typically, the MF3 activity could be detected following the initial fractionation step, but not in the crude cell extracts. For some analyses, the pool of MF3 activity from heparin-Sepharose chromatography was diluted with standard buffer and applied to a column of single-stranded DNA-cellulose (Pharmacia) that was equilibrated in standard buffer with 600 mM NaCl. MF3 activity was eluted with a step gradient to 800 mM NaCl, but the MF3 activity in these fractions was unstable to storage. The MF3 activity in Jurkat cell nuclear extracts was partially purified by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The DNA oligonucleotides were prepared with an Applied Biosystems 391EP DNA synthesizer using the phosphoramidite method and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates). Phosphoramidites were from Applied Biosystems Inc., except for dU, which was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA), and dI, which was obtained from Glen Labs. The MRE 1The abbreviations used are: MREmuscle regulatory elementXTEFXenopus telomere end-binding factor. probe contains the promoter sequences from positions −73 to −100 from the chicken skeletal α-actin gene. Single-stranded telomeric probes contained repeats of 5′-TTAGGG-3′, or derivatives thereof, downstream of a portion of the noncoding strand of the MRE sequence (5′-CGGCCGTCGCCATATTTG-3′) that was shown previously not to be bound by MF3(18Santoro I.M. Yi T. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The complete noncoding strand of the MRE, designated MREnc, is bound by MF3, and it has the sequence 5′-CGGCCGTCGCCATATTTGGGTGTCGGGC-3′. The RNA analog of the noncoding strand of the skeletal actin MRE was synthesized by in vitro transcription from a short synthetic DNA template(20Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). The transcription reaction utilized T7 RNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and an 18-base pair double-stranded promoter region upstream from a 28-nucleotide 5′-overhang corresponding to the coding strand of the MRE (except for position +1, which was changed from C to a G to increase the efficiency of transcription). Transcription reactions were incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM spermidine, 8 mg ml-1 polyethylene glycol, a 4 mM concentration of each nucleotide, and 2.5 units μl-1 T7 RNA polymerase. The concentration of each DNA strand was 0.25 μM. The reactions were terminated by extractions with phenol and chloroform, and the nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. The transcript was isolated on a preparative 15% polyacrylamide gel with 50% urea. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and confirmed by visual inspection on an analytical gel stained with ethidium bromide. The MREnc RNA product was sensitive to treatment with RNase or alkali, but it was stable when incubated with DNase. The VET2.0 RNA probe was made by a similar procedure, but the template for the transcription reaction was 5′ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCCGGCAGCGGTATAAATCCCAATCCC3′. Transfer RNA was from brewers' yeast (Boehringer Mannheim). muscle regulatory element Xenopus telomere end-binding factor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were typically performed with 0.02-0.6 ng of 32P-labeled DNA fragments and between 0.5 and 2.0 μl of heparin-Sepharose column fractions (with protein concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 mg ml-1). Binding reactions contained 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, and 0.1-1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 10 or 15 μl. Binding reactions were initiated by the addition of protein, and following a 5-10 min incubation at room temperature, binding mixtures were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 V cm-1 in 22 mM Tris borate buffer with 0.5 mM EDTA. Gels were dried and exposed to film overnight at −70°C with an intensifying screen. Probes used in the binding assays were labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (>4500 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.). Typically, the labeled probes were purified with Elutip-d columns (Schleicher & Schuell) according to the directions of the manufacturer. Competition experiments were carried out with a fixed concentration of probe and varying levels of nonlabeled competitor. Binding constants for the complexes between MF3 and the VET2.0, VET3.0, and VET4.0 probes were determined by incubating constant amounts of partially purified fraction from embryonic chicken skeletal muscle or adult turkey erythrocytes with increasing amounts of specific DNA sequence for 5-10 min at 25°C prior to gel electrophoresis under standard conditions (3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis and autoradiography, the regions corresponding to the protein-DNA complex and the free DNA were excised from the gel and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In other experiments, relative affinities were determined by comparing the test competitor with the nonlabeled probe in side-by-side experiments. DNA oligonucleotide probes, endlabeled with 32P, were methylated for 30 s in a solution consisting of 1 part dimethyl sulfate in 20 parts 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and 500 mM NaCl at 37°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 9 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and the probes were precipitated by the addition of ethanol. Cleavage of the methylated residues was performed by incubating the probes in 100 μl of 1 M piperidine at 90°C for 30 min. The samples were subsequently dried under vacuum and dissolved in deionized formamide prior to electrophoresis on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The intensities of the bands corresponding to the methylated guanosine or inosine bands in the two telomeric repeats were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) equipped with ImageQuant 3.3 software. Specific site occupancy levels were calculated with Theorist software (version 1.51) on a Macintosh Quadra 800 computer. Plots were imported to Canvas (version 3.0.6) for graphical presentation. A previous study of MF3 binding to single-stranded probes containing two telomeric repeats revealed that the substitution of dI at all dG positions in the internal repeat completely blocked factor binding(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since the dI base, hypoxanthine, lacks the N-2 amino group, these data demonstrated that 1 or more of the guanine residues of the internal repeat contribute a critical exocyclic amino group necessary for the formation of the nucleoprotein complex. To further explore the involvement of exocyclic amino groups in specific factor recognition, a series of dI-substituted derivatives of a vertebrate telomeric probe (VET2.0) were synthesized and assayed for their ability to bind to MF3 (Fig. 1). All derivative probes had dI substituted for dG in the terminal repeat (positions 4-6) and different combinations of dI and dG in the internal repeat (positions 1-3). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that nucleoprotein complexes were formed between MF3 and the parental probe, VET2.0 (end structure = GGGTTAGGG), and with VET2.1 (GGGTTAIII) and VET2.2 (IGGTTAIII), while VET2.3 (IIGTTAIII) was a slightly weaker binder (Fig. 2A). However, VET2.6 (IIITTAIII), which has dI substituted at all of the telomeric dG positions, was incapable of significant factor binding. Competition experiments were performed to analyze the relative affinities of these probes for the factor (Fig. 2B). VET2.0, VET2.1, VET2.2, and VET2.3 were comparable in their ability to compete for complex formation, but the VET2.6 derivative, with no dG residues, was an ineffective competitor. The dissociation constant for the VET2.0 nucleoprotein complex is 1.5 nM(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar dissociation constant values were obtained using DNA probes with either three or four telomeric repeats, referred to as VET3.0 and VET4.0, respectively (Table 1). In contrast, the competition data in Fig. 2B indicate that the VET2.6 nucleoprotein dissociation constant is >10-7M. These data demonstrate that high affinity factor binding can occur with probes containing two telomeric repeats and a single dG exocyclic amino group.Figure 2:A single guanine exocyclic amino group occurring in the internal telomeric repeat is required for factor binding. A, the VET2.0 parental probe and deoxyinosine-substituted probes were tested for their ability to form nucleoprotein complexes with factor in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For each assay, ~10,000 cpm (0.1 pmol) of each probe was used with 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC)•poly(dI-dC). B, shown is the competition for nucleoprotein complex formation with parental and deoxyinosine-substituted telomeric probes. Complexes were formed between factor and radiolabeled VET2.0 in the absence or presence of the designated competitor. Nonlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were present at 0, 10, 30, or 100 ng (from left to right). The factor source for these experiments was turkey erythrocytes.

Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it was found that the exocyclic N-2 amino groups of the internal telomeric repeat, but not the terminal telomeric repeat, were required for the formation of a structure that was partially protected from methylation by dimethyl sulfate. Since these same groups were also required for specific factor recognition, these data provided correlative evidence that MF3 recognizes a nucleic acid structure that is more complex than a random coil, and they indicated that the nucleoprotein complex may have a specific G • G base pair configuration at the core-binding site. To extend these analyses to the series of dI-substituted derivatives analyzed in this study, methylation protection studies were performed on the VET2.1, VET2.2, VET2.3, and VET2.6 probes (Fig. 3). The methylation protection of N-7 groups in the terminal repeat was most extensive with the VET2.1 probe, which has three exocyclic N-2 groups in the internal repeat. The VET2.2 probe, with two internal N-2 groups, and VET2.3, with one internal N-2 group, gave protection patterns that were intermediate between the VET2.1 and VET2.6 protection patterns. Collectively, these data provide further evidence that the VET2 series of probes can form a chemically protected structure that requires the presence of at least one exocyclic N-2 group within the internal telomeric repeat. Furthermore, these data indicate that the stability of the chemically protected structure is dependent upon the total number of internal exocyclic amino groups in that the extent of protection is more pronounced with three N-2 groups than with two or one. Next we performed binding experiments to determine whether the position of the dG exocyclic amino group in the internal telomeric repeat is critical for factor binding. For this experiment, the derivatives VET2.1 (end structure = GGGTTAIII), VET2.3 (IIGTTAIII), VET2.4 (IGITTAIII), and VET2.5 (GIITTAIII) were compared for their ability to compete for nucleoprotein complex formation in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 4). All of these dI-substituted probes were capable of significant competition, but the VET2.5 and VET2.4 probes (which have a single dG at positions 1 and 2, respectively) were slightly weaker competitors than the VET2.3 probe, which has a single dG at position 3. However, all the derivative probes with a single dG in the internal repeat were dramatically better at binding MF3 than was the probe that had a dI substitution at every dG position (VET2.6). Collectively, the ranking of probe affinity for MF3 is as follows: VET2.0, VET2.1, VET2.2 > VET2.3 > VET2.4, VET2.5 ≫ VET2.6. These data demonstrate that the guanine that contributes the critical N-2 group can occur at any dG position within the internal repeat, although position 3 was optimal for binding to MF3. A concern with single-stranded DNA-binding activities is the possibility that the physiological role of these proteins is to bind to RNA, the predominant single-stranded nucleic acid within the cell. To address the issue of DNA versus RNA specificity for MF3, the RNA analogs of two high affinity DNA-binding sites were tested for their abilities to form nucleoprotein complexes with MF3. The RNA analog of VET2.0 was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and a template that initiated transcription from a short double-stranded promoter situated upstream from the complementary strand of the VET2.0 probe. Unlike the VET2.0 DNA probe, the VET2.0 RNA probe was unable to form a nucleoprotein complex with MF3 (Fig. 5). No degradation of the RNA or DNA probe was detected when aliquots of the binding reactions were subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). Competition experiments were also performed with the RNA analog of another DNA site that is referred to as MREnc (Fig. 6A). This probe corresponds to the noncoding strand of the chicken skeletal actin promoter from positions −73 to −100, where MF3 specifically recognizes the region encompassing the two G-rich repeats in the 3′-portion of this molecule(18Santoro I.M. Yi T. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This RNA analog, MREnc RNA, was compared with deoxyribonucleic MREnc (MREnc DNA) for binding to MF3 in quantitative competition experiments (Fig. 6A). The MREnc DNA sequence was a potent competitor, but the RNA analog of this sequence and tRNA were relatively ineffective in their ability to compete for complex formation. Based on quantitative experiments with higher levels of competitor, the affinity of MF3 for RNA was 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than for the specific DNA site (Fig. 6B). The binding to MREnc RNA was nonspecific because this probe was no more effective than tRNA in its ability to compete for the formation of the specific nucleoprotein complex. We note that the affinity of MF3 for nonspecific sites in RNA was higher than for nonspecific sites in duplexed DNA, which have dissociation constants of ~10-4M (Table 1). Further experiments were performed to determine the structural requirements for high affinity binding to specific sequences in single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid. The ability of a protein to distinguish a single-stranded sequence of DNA from the same sequence of RNA can result from the presence of thymidine in place of uridine or from the absence of the 2′-hydroxyl group from the pyranose ring. dU was substituted in place of dT over the entire noncoding strand of the MRE to test whether the methyl group at position 5 of the pyrimidine base had a role in determining MF3 specificity (Fig. 7). The modified sequence is referred to as dU-MREnc. Quantitative competition assays revealed that the substitution of dU for dT had a minimal (<3-fold) effect on the affinity of MF3 for this sequence (Fig. 7). From these data, it appears that the specific recognition of DNA versus RNA results from the difference in ribose ring structure between these nucleic acids. In RNA, the 2′-hydroxyl groups impose severe stereochemical constraints on the overall conformation of the nucleic acid(21Saenger W. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1984: 51-104Crossref Google Scholar), and these data are consistent with the hypothesis that MF3 recognizes a specific DNA structure that may be more complex than a random coil of single-stranded nucleic acid(3Gualberto A. Patrick R.M. Walsh K. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Finally, the substitution of dI for dG in the 3′-portion of the MREnc probe diminished factor binding by a factor of 50 (Fig. 7), indicating that MF3 recognizes similar structural features in the MREnc and telomeric DNA probes. We wondered whether the nucleic acid recognition parameters of MF3 described above are consistent with the hypothesis that MF3 could occupy a significant fraction of telomere ends or other sites of altered DNA conformation in vivo. To address this issue, mathematical analyses were performed to evaluate the possibility of MF3 binding to a specific telomeric site in the presence of physiologically relevant levels of RNA and duplexed DNA that would act as nonspecific competitors. For these calculations, we considered a situation in which a protein is in equilibrium with a specific binding site in DNA (or RNA) and with nonspecific sites in DNA and RNA. describes the partitioning of factor between these three classes of binding sites. P⋅θ=Pt(θt-P⋅θ)Kθ(1+RNAt-P⋅RNAKRNA+DNAt-P⋅DNAKDNA)+(θt-P⋅θ)(Eq. 1) In, Pt, θt, DNAt, and RNAt are the total concentrations of the nucleic acid-binding protein, the specific binding site, DNA, and RNA, respectively. P•θ, P•DNA, and P•RNA are the concentrations of the different protein-nucleic acid complexes, and Kθ, KDNA, and KRNA are the equilibrium dissociation constants for specific binding, nonspecific binding to DNA, and nonspecific binding to RNA, respectively. is similar to the competition equation derived by Lin and Riggs(22Lin S. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but additional terms appear to account for nonspecific binding to RNA, a situation that is likely to occur with single-stranded nucleic acid-binding proteins. Under conditions where the total concentration of nonspecific sites in cellular nucleic acids greatly exceeds the concentration of binding protein and DNAt≫ P•DNA and RNAt≫ P•RNA, can be simplified, and substituting the term for fractional specific site occupancy (γ = P•θ/θt) gives. γ=Pt(1-γ)Kθ(1+RNAtKRNA+DNAtKDNA)+θt(1-γ)(Eq. 1) was used to evaluate how the occupancy of a specific site by MF3 or any other protein can be influenced by the abundance of factor and sites and by nonspecific binding to DNA and RNA (Fig. 8). The parameters used for calculations of site occupancy were derived from previous measurements of cellular DNA and RNA content and volume, estimates of telomere-binding protein levels, and a value for the volume of the nucleus that has been used by others. Similar assumptions have been used to estimate the extent of the adenovirus major late promoter by the MLTF DNA-binding protein(23Chodosh L.A. Carthew R.W. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The content of DNA and RNA in chicken embryo fibroblasts is 1.3 and 1.55 pg/cell, respectively (24Gol"
