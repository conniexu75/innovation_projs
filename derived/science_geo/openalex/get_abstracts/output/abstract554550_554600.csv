We explored the impact of neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) on antitumor immunity. Through integrated analysis of ITH and neoantigen burden, we demonstrate a relationship between clonal neoantigen burden and overall survival in primary lung adenocarcinomas. CD8(+)tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes reactive to clonal neoantigens were identified in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and expressed high levels of PD-1. Sensitivity to PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade in patients with advanced NSCLC and melanoma was enhanced in tumors enriched for clonal neoantigens. T cells recognizing clonal neoantigens were detectable in patients with durable clinical benefit. Cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced subclonal neoantigens, contributing to an increased mutational load, were enriched in certain poor responders. These data suggest that neoantigen heterogeneity may influence immune surveillance and support therapeutic developments targeting clonal neoantigens."

These cells are loaded with pigments that enable rapid and detailed camouflaging abilities. Larson et al. developed a stretchable electroluminescent actuator. The material could be highly stretched, could emit light, and could also sense internal and external pressure. A soft robot demonstrated these combined capabilities by stretching and emitting light as it moved. Science , this issue p. 1071"

This mixture, known as syngas, is then converted to hydrocarbons with Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. For the light olefins (ethylene to butylenes) needed for chemical and polymer synthesis, conventional catalysts are mechanistically limited to &lt;60% conversion and deactivate through carbon buildup. Jiao et al. developed a bifunctional catalyst that achieves higher conversions and avoids deactivation (see the Perspective by de Jong).

The propagation and maintenance of these genetic elements have been attributed to their ability to contribute to gene regulation. Chuong et al. demonstrate that some ERV families are enriched in regulatory elements, so that they act as independently evolved enhancers for immune genes in both humans and mice (see the Perspective by Lynch). The analysis revealed a primate-specific element that orchestrates the transcriptional response to interferons.

https://openalex.org/W1635919617,"Quantum computers are able to outperform classical algorithms. This was long recognized by the visionary Richard Feynman who pointed out in the 1980s that quantum mechanical problems were better solved with quantum machines. It was only in 1994 that Peter Shor came up with an algorithm that is able to calculate the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than known possible with a classical computer. This paradigmatic algorithm stimulated the flourishing research in quantum information processing and the quest for an actual implementation of a quantum computer. Over the last fifteen years, using skillful optimizations, several instances of a Shor algorithm have been implemented on various platforms and clearly proved the feasibility of quantum factoring. For general scalability, though, a different approach has to be pursued. Here, we report the realization of a fully scalable Shor algorithm as proposed by Kitaev. For this, we demonstrate factoring the number fifteen by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four ""cache-qubits"", together with the implementation of generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. The scalable algorithm has been realized with an ion-trap quantum computer exhibiting success probabilities in excess of 90%."

The search is on for drugs that selectively kill or diminish the malignant properties of these tumor-initiating cells (TICs; previously called “cancer stem cells”). Pattabiraman et al. hypothesized that compounds that induce TICs to undergo a phenotypic change called the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) would therefore cause TICs to lose their tumor-initiating ability. Indeed, drugs activating the protein kinase A signaling pathway triggered an epigenetic reprogramming of TICs that resulted in the cells acquiring a more benign epithelial-like phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2289858764,"Environmental endocrine disruptors (EDCs), including bisphenol-A (BPA), have been recently involved in obesity and diabetes by dysregulating adipose tissue function. Our aim was to examine whether prolonged exposure to low doses of BPA could affect adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolic functions. Therefore, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured for three weeks with BPA 1 nM to mimic human environmental exposure. We evaluated BPA effect on cell proliferation, differentiation, gene expression and adipocyte metabolic function. BPA significantly increased pre-adipocyte proliferation (p<0.01). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in the presence of BPA, the expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4/Adipocyte Protein 2 (FABP4/AP2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα) was increased by 3.5, 1.5 and 3 folds, respectively. Mature adipocytes also showed a significant increase in lipid accumulation (p<0.05) and alterations of insulin action, with significant reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose utilization (p<0.001). Moreover, in mature adipocytes, mRNA levels of Leptin, interleukin-6 (IL6) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) were significantly increased (p<0.05). In conclusion, BPA prolonged exposure at low doses, consistent with those found in the environment, may affect adipocyte differentiation program, enhancing pre-adipocyte proliferation and anticipating the expression of the master genes involved in lipid/glucose metabolism. The resulting adipocytes are hypertrophic, with impaired insulin signaling, reduced glucose utilization and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, these data supported the hypothesis that BPA exposure, during critical stages of adipose tissue development, may cause adipocyte metabolic dysfunction and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of developing obesity-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2330875406,"Cells rely on the precise action of proteins that detect and repair DNA damage. However, gene expression noise causes fluctuations in protein abundances that may compromise repair. For the Ada protein in Escherichia coli, which induces its own expression upon repairing DNA alkylation damage, we found that undamaged cells on average produce one Ada molecule per generation. Because production is stochastic, many cells have no Ada molecules and cannot induce the damage response until the first expression event occurs, which sometimes delays the response for generations. This creates a subpopulation of cells with increased mutation rates. Nongenetic variation in protein abundances thus leads to genetic heterogeneity in the population. Our results further suggest that cells balance reliable repair against toxic side effects of abundant DNA repair proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2290982066,"Credit assignment in the brain To discover relevant clues for survival, an organism must bridge the gap between the short time periods when a clue occurs and the potentially long waiting times after which feedback arrives. This so-called temporal credit-assignment problem is also a major challenge in machine learning. Gütig developed a representation of the responses of spiking neurons, whose derivative defines the direction along which a neuron's response changes most rapidly. By using a learning rule that follows this development, the temporal credit-assignment problem can be solved by training a neuron to match its number of output spikes to the number of clues. The same learning rule endows unsupervised neural networks with powerful learning capabilities. Science , this issue p. 10.1126/science.aab4113"

In bacteria and archaea, gene expression tracks with gene dosage, both of which increase after DNA replication. Voichek et al. , however, show that an increase in DNA dosage after replication does not increase gene expression in budding yeast. This expression buffering is mediated by the acetylation of newly synthesized histone H3 deposited on the replicated DNA. This acetylation helps suppress transcription from the excess DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2274642162,"Background Elderly adults should avoid medications with anticholinergic effects since they may increase the risk of adverse events, including falls, delirium, and cognitive impairment. However, data on anticholinergic burden are limited in subpopulations, such as individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). The objective of this study was to determine whether anticholinergic burden was associated with adverse outcomes in a PD inpatient population. Methods Using the Cerner Health Facts® database, we retrospectively examined anticholinergic medication use, diagnoses, and hospital revisits within a cohort of 16,302 PD inpatients admitted to a Cerner hospital between 2000 and 2011. Anticholinergic burden was computed using the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS). Primary outcomes were associations between ARS score and diagnosis of fracture and delirium. Secondary outcomes included associations between ARS score and 30-day hospital revisits. Results Many individuals (57.8%) were prescribed non-PD medications with moderate to very strong anticholinergic potential. Individuals with the greatest ARS score (≥4) were more likely to be diagnosed with fractures (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.56, 95% CI: 1.29–1.88) and delirium (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.08–2.40) relative to those with no anticholinergic burden. Similarly, inpatients with the greatest ARS score were more likely to visit the emergency department (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR): 1.32, 95% CI: 1.10–1.58) and be readmitted (AHR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.01–1.33) within 30-days of discharge. Conclusions We found a positive association between increased anticholinergic burden and adverse outcomes among individuals with PD. Additional pharmacovigilance studies are needed to better understand risks associated with anticholinergic medication use in PD."

The subsequently formed “transcription bubble” is required for RNA synthesis to begin. How RNA polymerase chooses the exact DNA base at which it will start transcription has been unclear. Winkelman et al. show that a control element upstream of the start site is involved in helping RNA polymerase make this choice in bacteria. Start site selection involves promoter scrunching, where a stationary RNA polymerase unwinds and pulls DNA through the active site, scrunching the DNA of the transcription bubble.

Perchlorate reductase (PcrAB), a specialized member of the dimethylsulfoxide reductase superfamily, catalyzes the first step of microbial perchlorate respiration, but little is known about the biochemistry, specificity, structure, and mechanism of PcrAB. Here we characterize the biophysics and phylogeny of this enzyme and report the 1.86-Å resolution PcrAB complex crystal structure.

Although the exact abiotic mechanisms of natural perchlorate neogenesis are not completely understood, there are no known biogenic mechanisms. In contrast, terrestrial perchlorate diagenesis primarily occurs biologically through microbial respiration (10.Urbansky E.T.

Perchlorate is sequentially reduced to chlorite by the perchlorate reductase (PcrAB), which is then dismutated into chloride and oxygen by the chlorite dismutase (Cld). The biogenic oxygen is respired by the same microorganism, generally through the use of a high affinity cytochrome cbb3 oxidase (3.Coates J.D. Achenbach L.A.

Due to oxygen biogenesis, these unique chemotrophs represent a distinctive metabolic juxtaposition between aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms. Although an impressive body of literature focuses on the biochemistry, genetics, and evolution of the Cld, relatively little is known about the PcrAB. We have shown that PcrAB is an oxygen-sensitive heterodimeric periplasmic enzyme that catalyzes the 2e− reduction of perchlorate to chlorate, which is further reduced by 2e− to form chlorite (3.Coates J.D.

This culture was then used to inoculate 1 liter of the same growth medium and incubated at the previously listed conditions. Anaerobic cultures were prepared by adding 100 ml of the overnight aerobic culture to sterile 1-liter glass bottles, and fresh sterile acetate, lactate, pyruvate growth medium containing 5 mm NaNO3, 10 mm NaClO3, and 10 mm NaClO4 was added until the bottles were completely filled with no headspace. The sealed bottles were then incubated without shaking at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Cultures changed from yellow to pink when all of the electron acceptors were consumed. This typically yielded 5–6 g of wet cell paste/ liter of anaerobic culture. Cells were harvested anaerobically by filling centrifuge tubes with the anaerobic cultures in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products), and the tubes were sealed, centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and returned to the anaerobic chamber where the supernatant was decanted. The pink cell pellets were resuspended in anaerobic buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol) to a density of 0.4 g of cells/ml, supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma), sealed in glass bottles, and frozen at −80 °C until needed. PcrAB was purified anaerobically using techniques described previously with some modifications (16.Yan A. Kiley P.J. Techniques to isolate O2-sensitive proteins: [4Fe-4S]-FNR as an example.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 463: 787-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Frozen cells were thawed, lysed under a nitrogen stream with an EmulsiFlex-C3 cell homogenizer (Avestin), and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified lysate was kept anaerobic until it was loaded onto three columns connected in tandem and equilibrated with anaerobic buffer A using an ÄKTA Explorer FPLC (GE Healthcare). The tandem series of columns consisted of a 1 × 20-cm S-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare), a 2.5 × 40-cm Q-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare), and finally a 2.5 × 5-cm CaPure-HA® hydroxyapatite column (Tosoh Bioscience). Once the sample was loaded and the UV/visible traces on the FPLC detector returned to baseline, the first two columns were removed, and PcrAB was eluted from the hydroxyapatite column using a 300-ml linear gradient to buffer B (buffer A with 400 mm NaH2PO4). PcrAB typically eluted at 200–250 mm NaH2PO4. Fractions containing activity as described below were pooled and concentrated in sealed centrifugal concentrators with 100-kDa-molecular mass-cutoff filters (Amicon) to <800 μl. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a HiPrep Sephacryl S-300 HR 16/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) that was equilibrated with anaerobic buffer C (buffer A with 150 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. PcrAB typically eluted at 50–60 ml. Fractions shown to be pure by SDS-PAGE were pooled and concentrated as described previously to 7 mg/ml, snap frozen in gasketed cryovials with liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined via the Bradford assay (Sigma). PcrAB containing the PcrA W461E mutation was purified in the same manner as wild-type PcrAB. The cNarGHI from Escherichia coli was a generous gift from the Weiner laboratory (University of Alberta). Activity assays of PcrAB and EccNarGHI were performed in an anaerobic chamber by monitoring the substrate-dependent oxidation of NADH (Sigma) with phenazine methosulfate (Sigma) as an electron shuttle (14.Heinnickel M. Smith S.C. Koo J. O'Connor S.M. Coates J.D. A bioassay for the detection of perchlorate in the ppb range.Environ. Sci. Technol. 2011; 45: 2958-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 450 μm NADH was incubated with 100 μm phenazine methosulfate and protein sample in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate. For reactions containing EccNarGHI, the buffer was supplemented with 0.01% (v/v) Thesit detergent (Sigma) to prevent the enzyme from precipitating. NADH oxidation rates were determined by monitoring the changes in absorbance at 340 nm (A340) using an Infinite F200 Pro plate reader (Tecan) at 25 °C. Reaction rates were determined by fitting the data in Origin 6.0 (MicroCal). Although the EccNarGHI Km value for nitrate established with our NADH/phenazine methosulfate assay was consistent with previous reports, the kcat values were lower (17.Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Kinetic analysis of respiratory nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli K12.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This suggests that phenazine methosulfate is not as efficient as an electron donor to EccNarGHI as other electron donors, such as methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, and plumbagin (17.Morpeth F.F. Boxer D.H. Kinetic analysis of respiratory nitrate reductase from Escherichia coli K12.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18.Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G.

PcrAB (7 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization solution (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.25, 20% (w/v) PEG 6000) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in the anaerobic chamber. All crystallization buffers were degassed before use, and crystallization trays were stored in the anaerobic chamber for at least 3 days before use. The brown rod-shaped crystals grew over 6 weeks at ∼20 °C. For W461E PcrA of PcrAB mutant, crystals were grown in 23% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, with an equal volume of protein and crystallization solution. The hexagonal plate crystals appeared after 1 month at ∼20 °C in the anaerobic chamber. A single crystal of wild-type or mutant PcrAB was transferred into crystallization solution supplemented with cryoprotectant of 20% (v/v) and subsequently 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol for wild-type PcrAB or 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol for mutant PcrAB. The crystal was mounted on a loop on a B3S base (MiTeGen) and inserted in a MicroRT capillary tube (MiTeGen) with 50 μl of reservoir solution in the sealed end of the tube to prevent dehydration. The mounted crystal was then transported outside of the anaerobic chamber and immediately snap frozen in liquid N2. The reduced PcrAB crystal (Protein Data Bank code 5CH7) was obtained by soaking 4 mm Na2SO3 in the presence of 1.2 mm reduced methyl viologen and 2.8 mm sodium dithionite. This solution was added to a drop containing a single oxidized PcrAB crystal (crystallized in 20% (w/v) PEG 6000, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5) in the anaerobic chamber for 18 h at ∼20 °C. Reduced methyl viologen was prepared as a 10 mm stock solution using the reservoir solution and a small amount of zinc powder as a reductant, which was subsequently removed via centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 min in the anaerobic chamber. For selenite-bound PcrAB (Protein Data Bank code 5CHC), a PcrAB crystal was soaked with 4 mm Na2SeO3 in the presence of reduced methyl viologen and sodium dithionite for 18 h at ∼20 °C as described above. The reduced PcrAB crystals were then transferred into crystallization solution supplemented with the aforementioned reducing agents and cryoprotectants. The mounting procedure for the reduced crystals was the same as described above. The x-ray diffraction data of PcrAB crystals were collected at BL12.3.1 SIBYLS beamline (sibyls.als.lbl.gov) at the Advanced Light Source (19.Classen S. Hura G.L. Holton J.M. Rambo R.P. Rodic I.

For oxidized PcrAB, two data sets from different spots of the same crystal were collected at 100 K and integrated using the XDS package (20.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The reduced PcrAB structures and W461E PcrA of PcrAB mutant structure were determined by molecular replacement using oxidized PcrAB as a search model. The molecular replacement solutions of reduced PcrAB were processed the same way as oxidized PcrAB except the twin law (−h−l,k,h) was applied for the mutant PcrAB (estimated twin fraction, 0.16) during refinement.

This PCR product was purified and combined with the pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® vector using the Zero Blunt® TOPO PCR cloning kit (Life Technologies) and transformed into XL1 Blue chemically competent E. coli (Stratagene). Positive transformants were grown in LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and plasmid DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen).

The current study describes clinico-hematological, epidemiological and therapeutic features of VL cases, admitted to university-affiliated hospitals, during 1999–2014 in Fars province, southwestern Iran. A total of 380 VL cases were recorded during a 16 years period, giving an average annual admission of 23.75 cases/year in which 217 (57.1%) were male and 163 (42.9%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 3.7 years. The majority of the cases (91.5%) were ≤ 5 years old. Bone-marrow aspiration detected Leishmania amastigotes only in 26.6% of cases. Fever (98.1%), abdominal protrusion (65.1%) and hepatosplenomegaly (63.7%) were the most common clinical presentations of the patients. Pancytopenia was noted in 43.1, anemia in 87.3 and thrombocytopenia in 64% of cases. Increase in the level of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) and CRP (C-Reactive Proteins) were seen in 84.9, 53.6, 44.4, 72.5 and 83.1% of cases, respectively. Mortality was noted in 5.3% of cases. Deranged haemato-biochemical parameters including total and direct bilirubin, PLT (platelet) and pancytopenia were significantly contributed to mortality from VL. Moreover, clinical features such as severe splenomegaly as well as bacterial infections were meaningfully contributed to death from VL. The majority of patients (74.9%) were treated with meglumine antimoniate. Amphotericin B was administrated in 59 of cases, 11 of them were initially treated with meglumine antimoniate with a shift to amphotericin B, because of treatment failure. Findings of the current study demonstrated that VL is present in southwest of Iran with a fairly continual rate during the last 16 years period. Deranged haemato-biochemical parameters along with severe splenomegaly contributed to mortality from VL."
https://openalex.org/W2288945704,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in children under five years of age. IL-17 and Th17 responses are increased in children infected with HRSV and have been implicated in both protective and pathogenic roles during infection. Bovine RSV (BRSV) is genetically closely related to HRSV and is a leading cause of severe respiratory infections in young cattle. While BRSV infection in the calf parallels many aspects of human infection with HRSV, IL-17 and Th17 responses have not been studied in the bovine. Here we demonstrate that calves infected with BRSV express significant levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22; and both CD4 T cells and γδ T cells contribute to this response. In addition to causing significant morbidity from uncomplicated infections, BRSV infection also contributes to the development of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), a leading cause of morbidity in both beef and dairy cattle. BRDC is caused by a primary viral infection, followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia by pathogens such as Mannheimia haemolytica. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo infection with M. haemolytica results in increased expression of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22. We have also developed an in vitro model of BRDC and show that co-infection of PBMC with BRSV followed by M. haemolytica leads to significantly exacerbated IL-17 production, which is primarily mediated by IL-17-producing γδ T cells. Together, our results demonstrate that calves, like humans, mount a robust IL-17 response during RSV infection; and suggest a previously unrecognized role for IL-17 and γδ T cells in the pathogenesis of BRDC."

We have investigated the microbial community of the air in a daycare center, including seasonal dynamics in the bacterial community and the presence of specific viral pathogens. We collected filters from the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system of a daycare center every two weeks over the course of a year. Amplifying and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the air was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes that are commonly associated with the human skin flora. Clear seasonal differences in the microbial community were not evident; however, the community structure differed when the daycare center was closed and unoccupied for a 13-day period. These results suggest that human occupancy, rather than the environment, is the major driver in shaping the microbial community structure in the air of the daycare center. Using PCR for targeted viruses, we detected a seasonal pattern in the presence of respiratory syncytial virus that included the period of typical occurrence of the disease related to the virus; however, we did not detect the presence of adenovirus or rotavirus at any time."

https://openalex.org/W2294593309,"Affective computing aims at the detection of users' mental states, in particular, emotions and dispositions during human-computer interactions. Detection can be achieved by measuring multimodal signals, namely, speech, facial expressions and/or psychobiology. Over the past years, one major approach was to identify the best features for each signal using different classification methods. Although this is of high priority, other subject-specific variables should not be neglected. In our study, we analyzed the effect of gender, age, personality and gender roles on the extracted psychobiological features (derived from skin conductance level, facial electromyography and heart rate variability) as well as the influence on the classification results. In an experimental human-computer interaction, five different affective states with picture material from the International Affective Picture System and ULM pictures were induced. A total of 127 subjects participated in the study. Among all potentially influencing variables (gender has been reported to be influential), age was the only variable that correlated significantly with psychobiological responses. In summary, the conducted classification processes resulted in 20% classification accuracy differences according to age and gender, especially when comparing the neutral condition with four other affective states. We suggest taking age and gender specifically into account for future studies in affective computing, as these may lead to an improvement of emotion recognition accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2292633421,"The upwelling of deep waters from the oxygen minimum zone in the Northeast Pacific from the continental slope to the shelf and into the Salish Sea during spring and summer offers a unique opportunity to study ecosystem functioning in the form of benthic fluxes along natural gradients. Using the ROV ROPOS we collected sediment cores from 10 sites in May and July 2011, and September 2013 to perform shipboard incubations and flux measurements. Specifically, we measured benthic fluxes of oxygen and nutrients to evaluate potential environmental drivers of benthic flux variation and ecosystem functioning along natural gradients of temperature and bottom water dissolved oxygen concentrations. The range of temperature and dissolved oxygen encountered across our study sites allowed us to apply a suite of multivariate analyses rarely used in flux studies to identify bottom water temperature as the primary environmental driver of benthic flux variation and organic matter remineralization. Redundancy analysis revealed that bottom water characteristics (temperature and dissolved oxygen), quality of organic matter (chl a:phaeo and C:N ratios) and sediment characteristics (mean grain size and porosity) explained 51.5% of benthic flux variation. Multivariate analyses identified significant spatial and temporal variation in benthic fluxes, demonstrating key differences between the Northeast Pacific and Salish Sea. Moreover, Northeast Pacific slope fluxes were generally lower than shelf fluxes. Spatial and temporal variation in benthic fluxes in the Salish Sea were driven primarily by differences in temperature and quality of organic matter on the seafloor following phytoplankton blooms. These results demonstrate the utility of multivariate approaches in differentiating among potential drivers of seafloor ecosystem functioning, and indicate that current and future predictive models of organic matter remineralization and ecosystem functioning of soft-muddy shelf and slope seafloor habitats should consider bottom water temperature variation. Bottom temperature has important implications for estimates of seasonal and spatial benthic flux variation, benthic-pelagic coupling, and impacts of predicted ocean warming at high latitudes."

Site-directed mutagenesis identified the precise site at which RHBDL2 cleaves CLEC14A, and targeted, small interfering RNAs that knockdown endogenous CLEC14A and RHBDL2 in human endothelial cells validated the specificity of CLEC14A shedding by RHBDL2. Loss of endogenous cleaved CLEC14A increased endothelial migration 2-fold, whereas that addition of recombinant cleaved CLEC14A inhibited the sprouting of human and murine endothelial cells 3-fold in several in vitro models. We assessed the in vivo role of cleaved CLEC14A in angiogenesis by using the rodent subcutaneous sponge implant model, and we found that CLEC14A protein inhibited vascular density by >;50%.

Our assumption was that ignoring geographic variables in the modelling procedure may result in inaccurate forecasting of species distributions. On the other hand, the inclusion of geographic variables may generate an artificial constraint on future projections. Our results show that space-included models performed better than space-excluded models. While distribution of suitable areas for T. tetrax in the future was approximately the same as at present in the space-included model, the space-excluded model predicted a pronounced geographic change of suitable areas for this species. In the case of O. tarda, the space-included model showed that many areas of current presence shifted to low or medium suitability in the future, whereas a northward expansion of intermediate suitable areas was predicted by the space-excluded one. According to the best models, current distribution of these species can restrict future distribution, probably due to dispersal constraints and site fidelity. Species ranges would be expected to shift gradually over the studied time period and, therefore, we consider it unlikely that most of the current distribution of these species in southern Europe will disappear in less than one hundred years. Therefore, populations currently occupying suitable areas should be a priority for conservation policies. Our results also show that climate-only models may have low explanatory power, and could benefit from adjustments using information on other environmental variables and biological traits; if the latter are not available, including the geographic predictor may improve the reliability of predicted results."
https://openalex.org/W2298467901,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been shown to deliver cargos, including protein, DNA, RNA, and nanomaterials, in fully active forms into live cells. Most of the CPP sequences in use today are based on non-native proteins that may be immunogenic. Here we demonstrate that the L5a CPP (RRWQW) from bovine lactoferricin (LFcin), stably and noncovalently complexed with plasmid DNA and prepared at an optimal nitrogen/phosphate ratio of 12, is able to efficiently enter into human lung cancer A549 cells. The L5a CPP delivered a plasmid containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding sequence that was subsequently expressed in cells, as revealed by real-time PCR and fluorescent microscopy at the mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Treatment with calcium chloride increased the level of gene expression, without affecting CPP-mediated transfection efficiency. Zeta-potential analysis revealed that positively electrostatic interactions of CPP/DNA complexes correlated with CPP-mediated transport. The L5a and L5a/DNA complexes were not cytotoxic. This biomimetic LFcin L5a represents one of the shortest effective CPPs and could be a promising lead peptide with less immunogenic for DNA delivery in gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2335392730,"ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad-3-related) is a protein kinase that maintains genome stability and halts cell cycle phase transitions in response to DNA lesions that block DNA polymerase movement. These DNA replication-associated features of ATR function have led to the emergence of ATR kinase inhibitors as potential adjuvants for DNA-damaging cancer chemotherapeutics. However, whether ATR affects the genotoxic stress response in non-replicating, non-cycling cells is currently unknown. We therefore used chemical inhibition of ATR kinase activity to examine the role of ATR in quiescent human cells. Although ATR inhibition had no obvious effects on the viability of non-cycling cells, inhibition of ATR partially protected non-replicating cells from the lethal effects of UV and UV mimetics. Analyses of various DNA damage response signaling pathways demonstrated that ATR inhibition reduced the activation of apoptotic signaling by these agents in non-cycling cells. The pro-apoptosis/cell death function of ATR is likely due to transcription stress because the lethal effects of compounds that block RNA polymerase movement were reduced in the presence of an ATR inhibitor. These results therefore suggest that whereas DNA polymerase stalling at DNA lesions activates ATR to protect cell viability and prevent apoptosis, the stalling of RNA polymerases instead activates ATR to induce an apoptotic form of cell death in non-cycling cells. These results have important implications regarding the use of ATR inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy regimens.

Given these features of ATR, there has been great interest in the development and use of selective small-molecule inhibitors of ATR kinase activity in cancer chemotherapy regimens in conjunction with compounds that damage DNA and generate replication stress (11.Karnitz L.M.

Through a related mechanism, ATR inhibition has also been implicated in preventing skin carcinogenesis by promoting the death of cells exposed to environmental carcinogens such as UV light (22.Kawasumi M.

Thus, the general consensus view is that ATR protects cells from DNA damage and that ATR inhibition increases the likelihood that DNA damage will result in cell death. However, the stalling of DNA polymerases by UV photoproducts and other bulky DNA lesions only takes place in cells that are actively replicating their DNA, and thus the function of ATR in response to DNA damage and transcription stress in non-replicating, non-cycling cells is not known. Although previous studies have indicated that ATR can be activated in non-cycling cells in response to DNA repair intermediates (25.Marini F. Nardo T. Giannattasio M. Minuzzo M. Stefanini M.

Here, we unexpectedly found that ATR inhibition actually protects non-cycling cells exposed to UV, UV mimetics, and other inducers of transcription stress from undergoing an apoptotic form of cell death. This finding differs significantly from the anti-apoptotic functions of ATR in replicating and cycling cells. Because most cells are in a quiescent or slowly growing state in vivo, we believe that these results have important implications for the use of ATR kinase inhibitors in cancer chemotherapy protocols. Human HaCaT keratinocytes, U2OS osteosarcoma cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and hTERT-immortalized normal human fibroblasts (NHF1) were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 6 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cycling cells were typically plated at 30% confluence and treated the following day. Non-cycling, quiescent cells were plated at 40–60% confluence, grown for 2 days in normal medium until the cells reached confluence, and then maintained for 2–3 days in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin before being subjected to experimental treatments as previously described (32.Lindsey-Boltz L.A.

To expose cells to the indicated fluences of UV radiation, media was removed and set aside before placing the cells under a GE germicidal lamp that emits primarily 254-nm UV light (UV-C) that was connected to a digital timer. Treatment with N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF), camptothecin, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole (DRB), and triptolide involved adding the compound directly to the culture medium of the cells. Cells were treated with DMSO, the ATR inhibitor VE-821 (10 μm), or other kinase inhibitors for 30–60 min prior to exposure to UV or addition of the indicated drugs. AAAF was purchased from the MRIGlobal Chemical Carcinogen Repository and resuspended in 95% ethanol. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), triptolide, DRB, and inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) MEK1/2 (U0126), p38 (SB202190), and Jun kinase (JNK; SP600125), the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks; wortmannin and LY294002), and AMP-dependent protein kinase (dorsomorphin/Compound C) were obtained from Sigma. Inhibitors of the DNA damage kinases ATR (VE-821 and AZD6738), ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM; KU-55933), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK; NU7441), and Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1; AZD7762) were purchased from Selleckchem. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (rapamycin) and Tank-binding protein 1 kinase (TBK1; BX795) were obtained from Invivogen. Lentiviral DNA particles were generated with HEK293T cells following co-transfection of the packaging plasmid psPAX2 and the envelope plasmid pMD2.G with the appropriate pLKO.1 vector and Lipofectamine 2000. Empty and XPA shRNA-containing pLKO.1 plasmids were from the Open Biosystems TRC1 shRNA library (37.Yang X. Boehm J.S. Yang X. Salehi-Ashtiani K. Hao T. Shen Y. Lubonja R. Thomas S.R. Alkan O.

Activation of p53-dependent growth suppression in human cells by mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 662-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold PBS, scraped from the plate, and pelleted by gentle centrifugation. Cells were then lysed for 20 min on ice in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Following centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at maximum speed, the soluble cell lysates were transferred to new tubes. For experiments examining the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX, the insoluble fraction was then resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 100 mm DTT, 1% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue) and sonicated. Equal amounts of soluble or insoluble cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed by immunoblotting using standard procedures. Primary antibodies included antibodies against ATR (sc-1887), CHK1 (sc-8408), p53 (sc-6243), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (sc-56), actin (I-19), XPB (sc-293), and XPA (sc-853) from Santa Cruz; RPA70 (A300–421A) and phospho-KAP1 (Ser824; A304–146A) from Bethyl Laboratories; and CHK2 (number 2662), phospho-CHK1 (Ser345; number 2348), phospho-CHK1 (Ser296; number 2349), phospho-CHK2 (Thr68; number 2621), phospho-p53 (Ser15; number 9284), phospho-p53 (Ser20; number 9287), phospho-H2AX (Ser139; number 9718), BCL2 (number 2872), cleaved caspase 3 (number 9661), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (number 9542), phospho-AKT (Ser473; number 9271), phosphor-c-Jun (Ser63, number 9261), and phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204; number 4370) from Cell Signaling Technology. All primary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 or 1:2000 dilution in 1× TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (NA934V) and anti-mouse IgG (NA931V) from GE Amersham Biosciences and anti-goat IgG (number 31402) from Pierce. Chemiluminescence was visualized with Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad) or ECL Prime Western blotting Detection Reagent (GE Amersham Biosciences) using a Molecular Imager Chemi-Doc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad). Chemiluminescent signals within the linear range of detection were quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). For each soluble lysate immunoblot, the phosphoprotein signal was quantified and normalized to actin levels in the same protein lysate, and the maximum signal for each blot was set to an arbitrary value of 100. All other phosphoprotein/actin ratios were then normalized to this value for each immunoblot. We note that actin levels did not change during the first few hours following UV and AAAF treatment, and decreased modestly at late time points (8–12 h) when cells began undergoing apoptosis. For analysis of phosphorylated H2AX, the blot was stained with 1% Ponceau red dye (Sigma) in 1% acetic acid (v/v) prior to blocking and immunoblotting. The membrane was then scanned, and the total histone signal quantified for normalization of the phospho-H2AX signals. All experiments analyzing DNA damage response signaling were repeated 2–4 times, and the average (and standard error) of the phosphoprotein/actin and phospho-H2AX/total histone ratios were determined and plotted. Cell survival assays were performed using 12- or 24-well plates, and survival was typically determined 2 days following treatment unless otherwise indicated. Following aspiration and removal of cell culture media and dead, floating cells and two washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were fixed for 30–60 min in cold 100% methanol at −20 °C. Methanol was then aspirated and replaced with 0.5% crystal violet stain (J.T. Baker) in 25% methanol for 10 min. The plates were then washed extensively in tap water to remove the excess stain. After drying, images of the stained cells were then taken on a Molecular Imager Chemi-Doc XRS+ system (Bio-Rad) for presentation of representative, qualitative results. The crystal violet stain was then solubilized in 1% SDS and the absorbance at 540 nm measured with a SpectraMax M3 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The absorbance of the untreated sample was set to an arbitrary value of 1 for each experiment, and the treatment samples normalized to this value. All cell survival experiments were performed at least 3 times. The level of DNA synthesis in cycling and non-cycling cells was measured with an immunoslot blot assay. BrdU (32.5 μm) was added to the cell culture medium 1 h prior to cell harvesting. Cells were washed in cold PBS, scraped from the plate, centrifuged at 1,600 × g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and then frozen on dry ice. Genomic DNA was then purified with a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA (1 mg) was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane with a Bio-Dot SF Cell immunoslot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) and baked at 80 °C under vacuum for 90 min.

Improving predictive accuracy requires understating of prediction limiting factors, such as the statistical methodology used, number and quality of features collected, or simply the population size. Using an in-silico approach (i.e., iterative computerized simulations), based on machine learning (ML) algorithms, we set out to analyze these factors. A cohort of 25,923 adult acute leukemia patients from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry was analyzed. Predictive objective was non-relapse mortality (NRM) 100 days following HSCT. Thousands of prediction models were developed under varying conditions: increasing sample size, specific subpopulations and an increasing number of variables, which were selected and ranked by separate feature selection algorithms. Depending on the algorithm, predictive performance plateaued on a population size of 6,611–8,814 patients, reaching a maximal area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.67. AUCs’ of models developed on specific subpopulation ranged from 0.59 to 0.67 for patients in second complete remission and receiving reduced intensity conditioning, respectively. Only 3–5 variables were necessary to achieve near maximal AUCs. The top 3 ranking variables, shared by all algorithms were disease stage, donor type, and conditioning regimen. Our findings empirically demonstrate that with regards to NRM prediction, few variables “carry the weight” and that traditional HSCT data has been “worn out”. “Breaking through” the predictive boundaries will likely require additional types of inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2291691437,"This study aims to examine the spatio-temporal dynamics of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) prevalence in four contiguous states of Midwestern United States, and to determine the impact of environmental and socio–economic factors associated with this disease. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to quantify space and time only trends and spatio–temporal interaction effect in the case reports submitted to the state health departments in the region. Various socio–economic, environmental and climatic covariates screened a priori in a bivariate procedure were added to a main–effects Bayesian model in progressive steps to evaluate important drivers of RMSF space-time patterns in the region. Our results show a steady increase in RMSF incidence over the study period to newer geographic areas, and the posterior probabilities of county-specific trends indicate clustering of high risk counties in the central and southern parts of the study region. At the spatial scale of a county, the prevalence levels of RMSF is influenced by poverty status, average relative humidity, and average land surface temperature (>35°C) in the region, and the relevance of these factors in the context of climate–change impacts on tick–borne diseases are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2288822151,"Sepsis-induced microcirculatory alterations contribute to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction. In addition to its plasma volume expanding activity, human serum albumin (HSA) has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and may have a protective role in the microcirculation during sepsis. The concentration of HSA infused may influence these effects. We compared the microcirculatory effects of the infusion of 4% and 20% HSA in an experimental model of sepsis.Adult male Wistar rats were equipped with arterial and venous catheters and received an intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, serotype O127:B8, 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes) or vehicle (SHAM, n = 6). Two hours later, endotoxemic animals were randomized to receive 10 mL/kg of either 4% HSA (LPS+4%HSA, n = 6), 20% HSA (LPS+20%HSA, n = 6) or 0.9% NaCl (LPS+0.9%NaCl, n = 6). No fluids were given to an additional 6 animals (LPS). Vessel density and perfusion were assessed in the skeletal muscle microcirculation with sidestream dark field videomicroscopy at baseline (t0), 2 hours after LPS injection (t1), after HSA infusion (t2) and 1 hour later (t3). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate were recorded. Serum endothelin-1 was measured at t2.MAP was stable over time in all groups. The microcirculatory parameters were significantly altered in endotoxemic animals at t1. The infusion of both 4% and 20% HSA similarly increased the perfused vessel density and blood flow velocity and decreased the flow heterogeneity to control values. Microvascular perfusion was preserved in the LPS+20%HSA group at t3, whereas alterations reappeared in the LPS+4%HSA group.In a rat model of normotensive endotoxemia, the infusion of 4% or 20% HSA produced a similar acute improvement in the microvascular perfusion in otherwise unresuscitated animals."
https://openalex.org/W2293600404,"Clan CD cysteine peptidases, a structurally related group of peptidases that include mammalian caspases, exhibit a wide range of important functions, along with a variety of specificities and activation mechanisms. However, for the clostripain family (denoted C11), little is currently known. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of a C11 protein from the human gut bacterium, Parabacteroides merdae (PmC11), determined to 1.7-Å resolution. PmC11 is a monomeric cysteine peptidase that comprises an extended caspase-like α/β/α sandwich and an unusual C-terminal domain. It shares core structural elements with clan CD cysteine peptidases but otherwise structurally differs from the other families in the clan. These studies also revealed a well ordered break in the polypeptide chain at Lys(147), resulting in a large conformational rearrangement close to the active site. Biochemical and kinetic analysis revealed Lys(147) to be an intramolecular processing site at which cleavage is required for full activation of the enzyme, suggesting an autoinhibitory mechanism for self-preservation. PmC11 has an acidic binding pocket and a preference for basic substrates, and accepts substrates with Arg and Lys in P1 and does not require Ca(2+) for activity. Collectively, these data provide insights into the mechanism and activity of PmC11 and a detailed framework for studies on C11 peptidases from other phylogenetic kingdoms."

The data together reveal that [Yfh1]24·[Isu1]24 is a roughly cubic macromolecule consisting of one symmetric Isu1 trimer binding on top of one symmetric Yfh1 trimer at each of its eight vertices. Furthermore, molecular modeling suggests that two subunits of the cysteine desulfurase, Nfs1, may bind symmetrically on top of two adjacent Isu1 trimers in a manner that creates two putative [2Fe-2S] cluster assembly centers. In each center, conserved amino acids known to be involved in sulfur and iron donation by Nfs1 and Yfh1, respectively, are in close proximity to the Fe-S cluster-coordinating residues of Isu1.

https://openalex.org/W2291578893,"Purpose To explore the effects of methane-rich saline (CH4 saline) on the capability of one-time exhaustive exercise in male SD rats. Methods Thirty rats were equally divided into to three groups at random: control group (C), placebo group (P) and methane saline group (M). Rats in M group underwent intraperitoneal injection of CH4 saline, and the other two groups simultaneously underwent intraperitoneal injection of normal saline. Then, the exercise capability of rats was tested through one-time exhaustive treadmill exercise except C group. Exercise time and body weight were recorded before and after one-time exhaustive exercise. After exhaustive exercise, the blood and gastrocnemius samples were collected from all rats to detect biochemical parameters in different methods. Results It was found that the treadmill running time was significantly longer in rats treated with CH4 saline. At the same time, CH4 saline reduced the elevation of LD and UN in blood caused by one-time exhaustive exercise. The low level of blood glucose induced by exhaustive exercise was also normalized by CH4 saline. Also CH4 saline lowered the level of CK in plasma. Furthermore, this research indicated that CH4 saline markedly increased the volume of T-AOC in plasma and alleviated the peak of TNF-α in both plasma and gastrocnemius. From H&E staining, CH4 saline effectively improved exercise-induced structural damage in gastrocnemius. Conclusions CH4 saline could enhance exercise capacity in male SD rats through increase of glucose aerobic oxidation, improvement of metabolic clearance and decrease of exhaustive exercise-induced gastrocnemius injury."
https://openalex.org/W2330405612,"The northeastern Caribbean Sea is under the seasonal influence of the Trade Winds but also of the Orinoco/Amazon freshwater plume. The latter is responsible for intensification of the Caribbean Current in general and of its eddy activity in the northern part of the Caribbean Sea. More importantly, we show in this study that the front of the freshwater plume drives a northward flow that impinges directly on the island of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. The angle of incidence of the incoming flow controls the nature of the wake on both sides and ends of the island, which changes from cyclonic to anticylonic wake flow, with either attached or shed eddies. Using an off-line bio-physical model, we simulated the dispersal and recruitment of an abundant Caribbean coral reef fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) in the context of the wake flow variability around St. Croix. Our results revealed the role played by the consistent seasonal forcing of the wake flow on the recruitment patterns around the island at the interannual scale. The interannual variability of the timing of arrival and northward penetration of the plume instead controls the nature of the wake, hence the regional spatial recruitment patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2290764652,"Introduction Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-activity and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) antigen are considered to be haemostasis-related markers of endothelial activation and relate to presence of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as was earlier shown in a cross-sectional study. We investigated whether tPA-activity and PAI-1 levels are associated with WMH progression in a longitudinal study. Methods In 127 first-ever lacunar stroke patients in whom baseline brain MRI and plasma levels of tPA-activity and PAI-1-antigen were available, we obtained a 2-year follow-up MRI. We assessed WMH progression by a visual WMH change scale. We determined the relationship between levels of tPA-activity and PAI-1 and WMH progression, by logistic regression analysis. Results Plasma tPA-activity was associated with periventricular WMH progression (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.01–5.49, with correction for age and sex and baseline presence of WMH), but not with deep or any (periventricular and/or deep) WMH progression. PAI-1 levels were lower in patients with WMH progression, but these results were not significant. Conclusion We found a relationship between plasma tPA-activity and progression of periventricular WMH. More research is needed to determine whether there is a (direct) role of tPA in the development and progression of WMH."
https://openalex.org/W2291440908,"Background/Objectives The changes in blood glucose concentrations that result from an oral glucose challenge are dependent on the rate of gastric emptying, the rate of glucose absorption and the rate of insulin-driven metabolism that include the incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The rate of insulin-driven metabolism is clearly altered in obese subjects, but it is controversial which of these factors is predominant. We aimed to quantify gastric emptying, plasma insulin, C-peptide, glucagon and glucose responses, as well as incretin hormone secretions in obese subjects and healthy controls during increasing glucose loads. Subjects/Methods The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial in a hospital research unit. A total of 12 normal weight (6 men and 6 women) and 12 non-diabetic obese (BMI > 30, 6 men and 6 women) participants took part in the study. Subjects received intragastric loads of 10 g, 25 g and 75 g glucose dissolved in 300 ml tap water. Results Main outcome measures were plasma GLP-1 and GIP, plasma glucagon, glucose, insulin, C-peptide and gastric emptying. The primary findings are: i) insulin resistance (P < 0.001) and hyperinsulinemia (P < 0.001); ii) decreased insulin disposal (P < 0.001); iii) trend for reduced GLP-1 responses at 75 g glucose; and iv) increased fasting glucagon levels (P < 0.001) in obese subjects. Conclusions It seems that, rather than changes in incretin secretion, fasting hyperglucagonemia and consequent hyperglycemia play a role in reduced disposal of insulin, contributing to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2290711576,"We recently reported that olfactory sensory neurons in the dorsal zone of the mouse olfactory epithelium exhibit drastic location-dependent differences in cilia length. Furthermore, genetic ablation of type III adenylyl cyclase (ACIII), a key olfactory signaling protein and ubiquitous marker for primary cilia, disrupts the cilia length pattern and results in considerably shorter cilia, independent of odor-induced activity. Given the significant impact of ACIII on cilia length in the dorsal zone, we sought to further investigate the relationship between cilia length and ACIII level in various regions throughout the mouse olfactory epithelium. We employed whole-mount immunohistochemical staining to examine olfactory cilia morphology in phosphodiesterase (PDE) 1C-/-;PDE4A-/- (simplified as PDEs-/- hereafter) and ACIII-/- mice in which ACIII levels are reduced and ablated, respectively. As expected, PDEs-/- animals exhibit dramatically shorter cilia in the dorsal zone (i.e., where the cilia pattern is found), similar to our previous observation in ACIII-/- mice. Remarkably, in a region not included in our previous study, ACIII-/- animals (but not PDEs-/- mice) have dramatically elongated, comet-shaped cilia, as opposed to characteristic star-shaped olfactory cilia. Here, we reveal that genetic ablation of ACIII has drastic, location-dependent effects on cilia architecture in the mouse nose. These results add a new dimension to our current understanding of olfactory cilia structure and regional organization of the olfactory epithelium. Together, these findings have significant implications for both cilia and sensory biology."

Though some studies confirmed rs6495308 polymorphisms to be associated with smoking behaviors and lung cancer, no research was conducted in China. Using a case-control study, we decided to investigate the associations between CHRNA3 rs6495308, CHRNB4 rs11072768, smoking behaviors and lung cancer risk, as well as explore whether the two SNPs have a direct or indirect carcinogenic effect on lung cancer.A total of 1025 males were interviewed using a structured questionnaire (204 male lung cancer patients and 821 healthy men) to acquire socio-demographic status and smoking behaviors. Venous blood samples were collected to measure rs6495308 and rs11072768 gene polymorphisms. All subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-smokers, light smokers (1-15 cigarettes per day) and heavy smokers (>15 cigarettes per day).Compared to wild genotype, rs6495308 and rs11072768 variant genotypes reported smoking more cigarettes per day and a higher pack-years of smoking (P<0.05). More importantly, among smokers, both rs6495308 CT/TT and rs11072768 GT/GG had a higher risk of lung cancer compared to wild genotype without adjusting for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.36, 95%CI = 1.09-1.95; OR = 1.11, 95%CI = 1.07-1.58 respectively). Furthermore, heavy smokers with rs6495308 or rs11072768 variant genotypes have a positive interactive effect on lung cancer after adjustment for potential confounding factors (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.01-3.09; OR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.01-3.41 respectively).

Depletion of PNT1 by RNAi in the T. brucei bloodstream form was lethal both in in vitro culture and in vivo in mice and the induced population accumulated cells lacking a kinetoplast.

https://openalex.org/W2288396520,"Drosophila is an extremely useful model organism for understanding how innate immune mechanisms defend against microbes and parasitoids. Large foreign objects trigger a potent cellular immune response in Drosophila larva. In the case of endoparasitoid wasp eggs, this response includes hemocyte proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and eventual encapsulation of the egg. The encapsulation reaction involves the attachment and spreading of hemocytes around the egg, which requires cytoskeletal rearrangements, changes in adhesion properties and cell shape, as well as melanization of the capsule. Guanine nucleotide metabolism has an essential role in the regulation of pathways necessary for this encapsulation response. Here, we show that the Drosophila inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), encoded by raspberry (ras), is centrally important for a proper cellular immune response against eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina boulardi. Notably, hemocyte attachment to the egg and subsequent melanization of the capsule are deficient in hypomorphic ras mutant larvae, which results in a compromised cellular immune response and increased survival of the parasitoid."

With the prospect of elucidating the physiological aspect of the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect we present a computational capillary-tissue system capable of mapping venous hemoglobin saturation- a marker of the BOLD hemodynamic response. Free and facilitated diffusion and convection for hemoglobin and oxygen are considered in the radial and axial directions. Hemoglobin reaction kinetics are governed by the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Brain activation, mimicked by dynamic transitions in cerebral blood velocity (CBv) and oxidative metabolism (CMRO2), is simulated by normalized changes in m = (ΔCBv/CBv)/(ΔCMRO2/CMRO2) of values 2, 3 and 4. Venous hemoglobin saturation profiles and peak oxygenation results, for m = 2, based upon a 50% and a 25% increase in CBv and CMRO2, respectively, lie within physiological limits exhibiting excellent correlation with the BOLD signal, for short-duration stimuli. Our analysis suggests basal CBv and CMRO2 values of 0.6 mm/s and 200 μmol/100g/min. Coupled CBv and CMRO2 responses, for m = 3 and m = 4, overestimate peak hemoglobin saturation, confirming the system's responsiveness to changes in hematocrit, CBv and CMRO2. Finally, factoring in neurovascular effects, we show that no initial dip will be observed unless there is a time delay in the onset of increased CBv relative to CMRO2."

Limiting the inflammatory response to the implanted devices in order to achieve better biocompatibility is a critical challenge. Herein we report on the production and the characterization of gold surfaces covalently derivatized with the peptide α-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), with a quantifiable surface density. In vitro study demonstrated that the tethered α-MSH is able to decrease the expression of an inflammatory cytokine produced by endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2290018642,"Blepharospasm (BSP) has a morbidity of 16 to 133 per million and is characterized by orbicularis oculi spasms. BSP can severely impact daily life. However, to date, its pathophysiology has not been clearly demonstrated. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a portable, non-invasive, and high time resolution apparatus used to measure cerebral blood flow. This study aimed to investigate the hemodynamic response patterns of BSP patients and determine whether BSP alone can be an attributional factor to influence the function of the prefrontal area using a verbal fluency task (VFT) and NIRS. Twenty-three BSP patients (10 males and 13 females) and 13 healthy controls (HC; five males and eight females) matched by gender and education were examined using NIRS. BSP patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of depression and anxiety symptoms. A covariance analysis was conducted to analyze differences between the three groups and reduce the influence of different ages and educational levels. Bonferroni was used to process the post hoc test. The bilateral orbitofrontal area (ch36, 39, and 41; P<0.01) exhibited a lower activation in BSP patients without psychiatric symptoms compared with HC. This study is the first report to identify the prefrontal function in BSP using NIRS. Our findings indicate that BSP alone may cause a hypoactive hemodynamic performance in the prefrontal cortex in the absence of psychiatric symptoms. These findings provide evidence to support novel pathophysiological mechanisms of BSP."
