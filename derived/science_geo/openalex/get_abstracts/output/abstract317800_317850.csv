https://openalex.org/W2087276577,A tree-ring width chronology of alerce trees (Fitzroya cupressoides) from southern Chile was used to produce an annually resolved 3622-year reconstruction of departures from mean summer temperatures (December to March) for southern South America. The longest interval with above-average temperatures was from 80 B.C. to A.D. 160. Long intervals with below-average temperatures were recorded from A.D. 300 to 470 and from A.D. 1490 to 1700. Neither this proxy temperature record nor instrumental data for southern South America for latitudes between 35 degrees and 44 degrees S provide evidence of a warming trend during the last decades of this century that could be related to anthropogenic causes. The data also indicate that alerce is the second longest living tree after the bristlecone pine (Pinus Iongaeva).

Although numerous observations have shown that volcanoes do not significantly contribute to the stratospheric chlorine burden, no quantitative explanation has been published. Hydrogen chloride (HCI) scavenging processes during the early phases of a volcanic eruption are discussed. A plume dynamics and thermodynamics model is used to show that HCI removal in condensed supercooled water can reduce HCI vapor concentrations by up to four orders of magnitude, preventing substantial stratospheric chlorine injection."

As a partial consequence, interannual variability of area-averaged monsoon rainfall was enhanced. Consistent with the climate sensitivity results from the model, observations showed a trend of increased interannual variability of Indian monsoon precipitation associated with warmer land and ocean temperatures in the monsoon region."
https://openalex.org/W2019097121,"Social insects live in societies that include both reproductive and nonreproductive adults. Understanding the factors that determine which individuals become successful reproductives is necessary to explain the evolution of these societies. The phenotypic effects of the gene Pgm-3 (or a closely linked gene) that may cause workers of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta to selectively execute all queens of a specific genotype were investigated. These effects, which involve differences in queen reproductive development, are expressed only in colonies exhibiting a particular type of social organization (multiple-queen colonies), and it is only in such colonies that selective execution on the basis of genotype occurs. This is an unusual example of genotype-environment interaction in gene expression in which the environmental component is the social environment. The queens executed are, surprisingly, those with the greatest reproductive development. Thus, there is a counterintuitive relation between the potential and realized reproductive success of queens in multiple-queen societies of this ant."

This cloud is deduced to be moving at 26 kilometers per second with respect to the sun, and in the same direction as the ""interstellar wind"" flowing through the solar system. Measurements by the Ulysses spacecraft show that neutral helium is drifting through the solar system at the same velocity, but neutral hydrogen appears to be moving at only 20 kilometers per second, a result confirmed by new measurements of the hydrogen emission line taken by the High-Resolution Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. These results indicate that neutral hydrogen atoms from the local interstellar cloud are preferentially decelerated at the heliospheric interface, most likely by charge-exchange with interstellar protons, while neutral helium is unaffected by the plasma. The magnitude of the observed deceleration implies an interstellar plasma density of 0.06 to 0.10 per cubic centimeter, which in turn implies that the heliospheric shock should be less than 100 astronomical units from the sun."

https://openalex.org/W2076042506,"The remanent magnetization of single-crystal iron whiskers has been measured from 10(-5) to 10(4) seconds after the removal of an applied field. The observed response is accurately modeled by localized magnon relaxation on a Gaussian size distribution of dynamically correlated domains, virtually identical to the distribution of excitations in glass-forming liquids. When fields of less than 1 oersted are removed, some relaxation occurs before 10(-5) second has elapsed; but when larger fields are removed, essentially all of the response can be accounted for by magnon relaxation over the available time window. The model provides a physical picture for the mechanism and observed distribution of Landau-Lifshitz damping parameters."

https://openalex.org/W2018923444,"IBM researchers have used a supercomputer to test the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). They showed that QCD correctly predicts the masses of the proton, neutron, pion, and other hadrons. The calculations were performed on a massively parallel computer called the GF-11, especially designed for performing the QCD calculations. The calculations took a year and required more than one hundred quadrillion arithmetic operations. The team computed mass ratios of 11 hadrons including the proton, pion, kaon, delta, and omega. Masses of three of the hadrons were fixed according to experimental measurements to allow for three unspecified parameters in QCD, quark charge and the masses of the normal and strange quarks. All the masses agreed to within 6% of experiment, and most were closer."
