https://openalex.org/W1987402927,"We have isolated mammalian neural crest cells using a monoclonal antibody to the low affinity NGF receptor, and established conditions for the serial propagation of these cells in clonal culture to assess their developmental potential. This analysis indicates that, first, single mammalian neural crest cells are multipotent, able to generate at least neurons and Schwann cells like their avian counterparts. Second, multipotent neural crest cells generate multipotent progeny, indicating that they are capable of self-renewal and therefore are stem cells. Third, multipotent neural crest cells also generate some clonal progeny that form only neurons or glia, suggesting the production of committed neuroblasts and glioblasts. Manipulation of the substrate alters the fate of the multipotent cells. These findings have implications for models of neural crest development in vivo, and establish a system for studying the generation of cellular diversity by a multipotent stem cell in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2070981546,A gene from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana that encodes an omega-3 desaturase was cloned on the basis of the genetic map position of a mutation affecting membrane and storage lipid fatty acid composition. Yeast artificial chromosomes covering the genetic locus were identified and used to probe a seed complementary DNA library. A complementary DNA clone for the desaturase was identified and introduced into roots of both wild-type and mutant plants by Ti plasmid-mediated transformation. Transgenic tissues of both mutant and wild-type plants had significantly increased amounts of the fatty acid produced by this desaturase.

https://openalex.org/W2105603763,"Transgenic mice were generated that expressed a human collagenase transgene in their lungs under the direction of the haptoglobin promoter. Histological analysis demonstrated disruption of the alveolar walls and coalescence of the alveolar spaces with no evidence of fibrosis or inflammation. This pathology is strikingly similar to the morphological changes observed in human emphysema and therefore implicates interstitial collagenase as a possible etiological agent in the disease process. Although elastase has been proposed as the primary enzyme responsible for emphysematous lung damage, this study provides evidence that other extracellular matrix proteases could play a role in emphysema. In addition, these transgenic mice are a defined genetic animal model system to study the pathogenesis of emphysema."

The lifetime for decay of the neuronal activation trace in primary auditory cortex was found to predict the psychophysically determined duration of memory for the loudness of a tone. Although memory for the loudness of a specific tone is lost, the remembered loudness decays toward the global mean of all of the loudnesses to which a subject is exposed in a series of trials."
https://openalex.org/W1993973779,"To examine the basis for the evolutionary selection for codirectionality of replication and transcription in Escherichia coli, electron microscopy was used to visualize replication from an inducible ColE1 replication origin inserted into the Escherichia coli chromosome upstream (5') or downstream (3') of rrnB, a ribosomal RNA operon. Active rrnB operons were replicated either in the same direction in which they were transcribed or in the opposite direction. In either direction, RNA polymerases were dislodged during replication. When replication and transcription were codirectional, the rate of replication fork movement was similar to that observed in nontranscribed regions. When replication and transcription occurred in opposite directions, replication fork movement was reduced."
https://openalex.org/W1968764028,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase III transcription factor (TF)IIIB has been assembled from three components. An assembly pathway of these polypeptides, which specifies their interactions, has been determined. The TATA-binding protein, TBP, and the TFIIB-related BRF1 gene product BRF, together reconstitute the transcription factor activity and TFIIC-dependent DNA-binding activity of the B' component of TFIIIB. BRF alone weakly binds to a TFIIIC-tRNA gene complex; TBP greatly stabilizes this interaction. B"" transcription factor activity is recovered with its previously identified 90 kd polypeptide from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Incorporation of the 90 kd B"" protein into the transcription complex requires TBP. The heparin-resistant TFIIIB-DNA complex retains all three of its constituent proteins, TBP, BRF, and B""."

https://openalex.org/W1530081569,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a mesenchymal-derived factor which regulates growth, motility, and morphogenesis of epithelial and endothelial cells, functions as a hepatotrophic and renotrophic factor for regeneration of the liver and kidney. We have now obtained evidence that transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and glucocorticoids are negative regulators for HGF gene expression. When TGF-beta 1 or dexamethasone was added to cultures of MRC-5 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemic cells, the amount of HGF secreted into the culture medium was inhibited to 30-40% of that of control cultures by 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 and to 40-50% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. The inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone on HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells was additive, thereby suggesting that TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone exert effects through distinct mechanisms. Hydrocortisone also inhibited HGF synthesis with the same potency as dexamethasone; however, testosterone, estriol, and beta-estradiol had no effect. The rate of HGF synthesis in MRC-5 cells, as measured by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine and subsequent immunoprecipitation, was suppressed to 30-40% of the control with 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1, and to 30-45% by 10(-6) M dexamethasone. HGF mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells were dose-dependently suppressed by TGF-beta 1 and dexamethasone; 10 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 suppressed HGF mRNA levels to 32% and 35% of control culture, respectively, in MRC-5 cells and HL-60 cells, and 10(-6) M dexamethasone suppressed to 43% and 38%, respectively. Thus, TGF-beta 1 and glucocorticoids seem to inhibit HGF synthesis by suppressing the expression of the HGF gene. We propose that a negative regulation of HGF gene expression by TGF-beta 1 or glucocorticoids may be involved in physiological or pathological processes during tissue regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2076499829,Fluorescence-detected stopped-flow and equilibrium methods have been used to study the mechanism for binding of pyrene (pyr)-labeled RNA oligomer substrates to the ribozyme (catalytic RNA) from Tetrahymena thermophila. The fluorescence of these substrates increases up to 25-fold on binding to the ribozyme. Stopped-flow experiments provide evidence that pyr experiences at least three different microenvironments during the binding process. A minimal mechanism is presented in which substrate initially base pairs to ribozyme and subsequently forms tertiary contacts in an RNA folding step. All four microscopic rate constants are measured for ribozyme binding of pyrCCUCU.
https://openalex.org/W1993363871,"The TATA box-binding protein TBP directs transcription by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. In mammalian cells, TBP is found in at least three different complexes: SL1, D-TFIID, and B-TFIID. While SL1 and D-TFIID are involved in RNA polymerase I and II transcription, respectively, no unique function has been assigned to the B-TFIID complex. Here we show that the TFIIIB fraction required for RNA polymerase III transcription contains two separable components, one of which is a TBP-containing complex that may correspond to B-TFIID. For transcription of TATA-less RNA polymerase III genes such as the VAI, 5S, and 7SL genes, this complex cannot be replaced by either TBP alone or the D-TFIID complex. In contrast, TBP alone is active for basal transcription from the TATA-containing U6 promoter. This indicates different requirements for recruiting TBP to TATA-less and TATA-containing RNA polymerase III promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1518280877,"Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) is a three-domain toxin which is cleaved by a cellular protease within cells and then reduced to generate two prominent fragments (Ogata, M., Chaudhary, V. K., Pastan, I., and FitzGerald, D. J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20678-20685). The N-terminal fragment is 28 kDa in size and contains the binding domain. The 37-kDa C-terminal fragment, which translocates to the cytosol, contains the translocation domain and the ADP-ribosylation domain. Cleavage followed by reduction is essential for toxicity since mutant forms of the toxin that cannot be cleaved by cells are nontoxic. Previous results with these mutants suggest that cleavage occurred in an arginine-rich (arginine residues are at positions 274, 276, and 279) disulfide loop near the beginning of the translocation domain, but the exact site of cleavage was not determined. Since very few molecules of the 37-kDa fragment are generated within cells it was not possible to determine the site of cleavage by performing a conventional N-terminal sequence analysis of the 37-kDa fragment. Two experimental approaches were used to overcome this limitation. First, existing amino acids near the cleavage sites were replaced with methionine residues; this was followed by the addition of [35S]methionine-labeled versions of these toxins to cells. The pattern of radioactive toxin fragments recovered from the cells indicated that the toxin was cleaved either just before or just after Arg279. Second, [3H]leucine-labeled toxin was produced and added to the cells. Sequential Edman degradations were performed on the small amount of radioactive 37-kDa fragment that could be recovered from toxin-treated cells. A peak of radioactivity in the fifth fraction indicated that leucine was the 5th amino acid on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site. This result confirmed that cleavage was between Arg279 and Gly280."
https://openalex.org/W2081149733,"RNA polymerases I, II, and III require the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to initiate promoter-specific transcription. We have separated HeLa TBP into four phosphocellulose fractions that elicit polymerase specificity in supplying TBP activity to TBP-depleted pol II and pol III transcription reactions. Polymerase specificity might arise in part through distinct TBP-associated factors (TAFs), which have recently been identified in pol I and II transcription. However, the requirement for pol III TAFs has not been established. Here we show that classical pol III transcription involves a minimum of two novel TAFs: TAF-172 and TAF-L. Not only does TAF-172 activate pol III transcription, but it also inhibits the binding of TBP to the TATA box, thereby repressing pol II transcription. The TBP-TAF-172-TAF-L complex can replace TFIIIB both in transcription reactions reconstituted with TFIIIC and in template commitment assays. Thus SL1, TFIID, and TFIIIB might be functionally similar TBP-TAF complexes that direct pol I, II, and III transcription, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1515543767,"We have shown previously that macromolecules can be nondestructively delivered into cultured cells via folate receptor-mediated endocytosis if the macromolecules are conjugated to folic acid prior to addition to receptor-bearing cells (Leamon, C.P., and Low, P. S. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 5572-5576). Although an intracellular destination of the folate-linked proteins could be easily documented, the spatial resolution of the earlier data was insufficient to evaluate whether any endocytosed material was delivered into the cytosol. To resolve this issue, a folate-toxin conjugate was constructed using the impermeable ribosome-inactivating protein, momordin. Diminution of [3H]leucine incorporation into newly synthesized protein was then employed as a quantitative measure of the entry of the toxin into the cytosol. In studies with both HeLa and KB cells, cellular protein synthesis was found to be inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by the momordin-folate conjugate, but not by the underivatized toxin. IC50 values centered around 10(-9) M for the folate-linked samples. These observations provide direct evidence that folate conjugates not only reach the cytosol, but do so in a functionally active form."
https://openalex.org/W2128774980,"The haywire gene of Drosophila encodes a protein with 66% identity to the product of the human ERCC3 gene, associated with xeroderma pigmentosum B (XP-B) and Cockayne's syndrome (CS). XP is a human autosomal recessive disease characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation and marked susceptibility to skin cancer. In addition, XP and CS patients often exhibit a variety of defects, ranging from central nervous system disorders to hypogonadism. Phenotypes of haywire mutants mimic some of the effects of XP. Many haywire alleles are recessive lethal, viable alleles cause ultraviolet sensitivity, and files expressing marginal levels of haywire display motor defects and reduced life span. Progeny of females carrying a maternal effect allele show central nervous system defects."
https://openalex.org/W2080927800,"The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is required for transcription by RNA polymerase III (pol III), even though many pol III templates, such as the adenovirus VA1 gene, lack a consensus TATA box. We show that TBP alone does not form a stable, productive interaction with VA1 DNA. However, it can be incorporated into an initiation complex if the other class III basal factors, TFIIIB and TFIIIC, are also present. TFIIIB can associate with the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal domain of TBP in the absence of DNA or TFIIIC, suggesting that TFIIIB exists in solution as a complex with TBP. The stable association of TBP with an essential component of the pol III transcription apparatus may account for the ability of TATA-less class III genes to recruit TBP."
https://openalex.org/W1971496632,"The amount of the heterotrimeric G protein subunit G alpha i2 decreases after the induction of F9 teratocarcinoma cells to become primitive endoderm in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). The reduction of the G alpha i2 protein in F9 cells by antisense RNA expression was associated with (i) loss of receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase; (ii) decreased cell doubling time; (iii) induction of a primitive, endoderm-like phenotype in the absence of RA; and (iv) production of the differentiation marker tissue-type plasminogen activator. Expression of a constitutively active, mutant G alpha i2 blocked RA-induced differentiation. These data suggest the involvement of G alpha i2 in the control of stem cell differentiation and provide insight into the involvement of G proteins in growth regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1494626566,"To investigate the influence of flanking amino acid sequence on the O-glycosylation of a single threonine residue in vitro, we have examined a series of 52 related peptides. The substrates were based upon a sequence from human von Willebrand factor which is known to be glycosylated in vivo (-6PHMAQVTVGPGL+5). Each residue of the parent peptide was substituted, in turn, with isoleucine, alanine, proline, glutamic acid, or arginine. Peptides were glycosylated using a UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase purified 15,000-fold from bovine colostrum by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, SP-Sephadex, Sephacryl S-300, Affi-Gel Blue, and 5-mercuri-UDP-GalNAc thiopropyl-Sepharose. Single amino acid changes in the sequences flanking the threonine could profoundly alter the glycosylation of the substrate peptides. Substitution of any amino acid tested at positions +3, -3, and -2 markedly decreased O-glycosylation, as did the presence of a charged residue at position -1. The substitution of amino acids at the other positions of the peptide substrate had little effect on the incorporation of GalNAc. Statistical analysis of sequences flanking known glycosylated threonine and serine residues suggests that they should be glycosylated with equal efficiency in the same sequence context (O'Connell et al., 1991). However, the bovine colostrum transferase failed to glycosylate a peptide derived from human erythropoietin which contains a serine that is glycosylated in vivo (-5PPDAASAAPLR+5). When a threonine was substituted for the serine in this peptide (-5PPDAATAAPLR+5), the substrate proved to be an excellent acceptor of GalNAc. These observations indicate that although flanking amino acid sequence is important for the O-glycosylation of specific hydroxyamino acids, discrete threonine- and serine-specific transferases may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1531764551,"The in vivo turnover rate of the endoplasmic reticulum protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is accelerated when excess MVA or sterols are added to the growth medium of cells. As we have shown recently (Roitelman, J., Bar-Nun, S., Inoue, S., and Simoni, R. D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16085-16091), perturbation of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis abrogates the MVA-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal. Here we show that, in contrast, the sterol-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is unaffected by Ca2+ perturbation achieved either by Ca2+ ionophore or by inhibitors of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. The differential effects of Ca2+ perturbation can be attributed neither to global alteration in protein synthesis nor to inhibition of MVA conversion to sterols. Yet, such manipulations markedly reduce the incorporation of MVA into cellular macromolecules, including prenylated proteins. Furthermore, we directly demonstrate that MVA gives rise to at least two distinct signals, one that is essential to support the effect of sterols and another that operates independently of sterols. Our results indicate that the cellular signals operating in the MVA-accelerated turnover of HMG-CoA reductase are distinct from those involved in the sterol-regulated degradation. A working model for the degradation pathway is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1522313161,"Subtilin and nisin are gene-encoded antibiotic peptides that are ribosomally synthesized by Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. Gene-encoded antibiotics are unique in that their structures can be manipulated by mutagenesis of their structural genes. Although subtilin and nisin share considerable structural homology, subtilin has a greater tendency than nisin to undergo spontaneous inactivation. This inactivation is a accompanied by chemical modification of the dehydroalanine at position 5 (DHA5) with a kinetic first-order t1/2 of 0.8 days. It was hypothesized that the R group carboxyl of Glu4 in subtilin participates in the chemical modification of the adjacent DHA5. Noting that nisin has Ile at position 4, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Glu4 of subtilin to Ile, in order to eliminate this carboxyl-group participation. The DHA5 of this mutant subtilin (E4I-subtilin) underwent modification with a t1/2 of 48 days, which is 57-fold slower than natural subtilin, and the rate of loss of biological activity dropped by a like amount. These results suggest that an intact DHA5 is critical for subtilin activity against bacterial spore outgrowth. A double mutant of subtilin, in which the DHA5 residue of E4I-subtilin was mutated to Ala was devoid of detectable inhibition against spore outgrowth. The specific activity of E4I-subtilin was 3-4-fold higher than natural subtilin, suggesting that an increase in the hydrophobicity of the N-terminal end of the molecule enhances activity. These are the first mutants of subtilin that have been reported, and E4I-subtilin is the first example of any lantibiotic whose properties have been improved by mutagenesis. In order to carry out the mutagenesis, a host-vector pair was constructed that permits a deletion replacement in which the natural subtilin gene is replaced by the mutant gene at the normal location in the chromosome. This maintains normal gene dosage and regulatory responses, as well as eliminates ambiguities caused by expression of the normal and mutant genes in the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W1580121000,"Abstract Protein ferroxidase site(s), which catalyze the reaction between ferrous ion and dioxygen, have long been thought to play a role in core formation in ferritin; however, the mechanism of the reaction has never been studied in detail. In the present work, the enzymatic activity of ferritin was examined using oximetry, the net Fe2+ oxidation reaction being as follows. [formula: see text] The reaction exhibits saturation kinetics with respect to both Fe2+ and O2 (apparent Michaelis constants: Km,Fe = 0.35 +/- 0.01 mM and Km,O2 = 0.14 +/- 0.03 mM). The enzyme has a turnover number kcat = 80 +/- 3 min-1 at 20 degrees C with maximal activity at pH 7. The kinetics are discussed in terms of two mechanisms, one involving monomeric and the other dimeric iron protein complexes. In both instances Fe(II) oxidation occurs in 1-electron steps. Zinc(II) is a competitive inhibitor of iron(II) oxidation at Zn2+/apoprotein ratios > or = 6 (inhibitor constant KI,Zn = 0.067 +/- 0.011 mM) but appears to be a noncompetitive inhibitor at lower ratios (< or = 2), indicating the presence of more than one type of zinc binding site on the protein. At increments of 50 Fe2+/protein or less, all of the iron is oxidized via the protein ferroxidase site(s), independent of the amount of core already present. However, when larger increments are employed, some iron oxidation appears to occur on the surface of the mineral core. The results of these studies emphasize the role of the protein shell in all phases of core growth and confirm the presence of a functionally important catalytic site in ferritin in addition to other binding sites on the protein for iron."
https://openalex.org/W1599970058,"Interleukin 2 (IL-2) can stimulate the proliferation of various kinds of T-cell lines. The receptor for IL-2 is composed of at least two subunits (alpha and beta), of which beta subunit plays the major role in transducing growth signals into the cells. A nonreceptor-type tyrosine kinase, Lck, is associated with IL-2 receptor beta subunit, and the binding of IL-2 to its receptor induces the activation of Lck. On the other hand, it has been shown that stimulation of T-cells with IL-2 causes rapid activation of Ras protein. In this paper, we describe that both of the two regions in IL-2 receptor beta subunit, the indispensable region for the induction of cell growth (serine-rich region) and the binding region of Lck protein (acidic region), are required for the activation of Ras. These two regions are also required for tyrosine phosphorylation of an 85-kDa cellular protein (p85) and the accumulation of fos and jun mRNAs. This observation suggests also that the activation of a receptor-associated tyrosine kinase in response to IL-2-stimulation is primarily responsible for subsequent activation of the pathway through Ras to Fos and Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1499784197,"Neutrophils synthesize and store intracellularly a 92-kDa type IV collagenase (gelatinase), the primary structure of which is unknown. We designed a primer based on the highly conserved cysteine-switch region of metalloproteinases and employed the polymerase chain reaction to generate a probe of the human neutrophil gelatinase (HNG) gene. This probe was used to clone the cDNA encoding HNG by screening a chronic granulocytic leukemia cDNA library. In vitro translation of the cDNA-derived HNG mRNA yielded a major product of 78 kDa and smaller autolytically activated or degraded products, all of which were recognized by anti-HNG antibody. The HNG cDNA sequence is nearly identical to that encoding a 92-kDa gelatinase secreted by HT1080 cells. In addition, primer extension and S1 analysis reveal that the above two gelatinase transcripts have similar initiation sites. The HNG cDNA hybridized to a 2.8-kilobase mRNA from chronic granulocytic leukemia cells. HNG mRNA expression was absent from uninduced HL60 cells and from HL60 cells induced to granulocytic maturation with Me2SO. However, unlike other neutrophil secondary granule genes, HNG mRNA was detected in HL60 cells induced to monocytic maturation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. This suggests that the HNG gene may be subject to differential control pathways in two related but distinct hematopoietic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1598579140,"In principle, competitive inhibitors of glyoxalase I that also serve as substrates for the thioester hydrolase glyoxalase II might function as tumor-selective anti-cancer agents, given the role of these enzymes in removing cytotoxic methylglyoxal from cells and the observation that glyoxalase II activity is abnormally low in some types of cancer cells. In support of the feasibility of this anticancer strategy, an inhibitor of this type has been synthesized by a thioester-interchange reaction between glutathione and N-hydroxy-N-methylcarbamate 4-chlorophenyl ester to give S-(N-hydroxy-N-methylcarbamoyl)glutathione (1). This compound was designed to be a tight-binding inhibitor of glyoxalase I, on the basis of its stereoelectronic similarity to the enediol(ate) intermediate that forms along the reaction pathway of this enzyme. Indeed, 1 is a competitive inhibitor of yeast glyoxalase I, with an inhibition constant (Ki = 68 microM) that is approximately 30-fold lower than that reported for S-D-lactoylglutathione and approximately 7-fold lower than the Km for glutathione-methylglyoxal thiohemiacetal. In addition, 1 is a substrate for bovine liver glyoxalase II, with a Km (0.48 mM) approximately equal to that of the normal substrate S-D-lactoyglutathione and a kcat approximately 2 x 10(-5)-fold that of the normal substrate. Membrane transport studies show that 1 can be delivered into human erythrocytes (used here as a model cell) either by direct diffusion of 1 across the cell membrane or by more rapid diffusion of the glycylethyl ester of 1 across the cell membrane, followed by the catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester to give 1."
https://openalex.org/W1494702528,"Several authors have suggested that 27-hydroxycholesterol may be an important physiological regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study we investigated the possibility that 24- or 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is of importance for the down-regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in mouse liver induced by dietary cholesterol. Using an accurate method based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry with deuterated internal standards, we were able to detect significant levels of both 24- and 27-hydroxycholesterol in liver homogenates from normal mice. Feeding cholesterol, 2% for 4 days, increased the levels by 80 and 30%, respectively. No significant hepatic levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol could be demonstrated in untreated mice, and the level of this steroid in cholesterol-treated mice was just above the detection limit. Mouse liver mitochondria were able to catalyze 24- as well as 27-hydroxylation, but not 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol. There was no such conversion in liver microsomes. When using 24-2H2- or 23,23,24,24,25-2H5-labeled cholesterol as substrate a kinetic isotope effect of about 4.5 was observed for the mitochondrial 24-hydroxylation. When using 26,26,26,27,27,27-2H6-labeled cholesterol as substrate a kinetic isotope effect of about 2.5 was observed for the 27-hydroxylation. Use of those deuterium-labeled cholesterol species thus allowed a specific suppression of the rate of 24- and 27-hydroxylation. Feeding mice with 0.05% unlabeled pure cholesterol in the diet for 24 h inhibited the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity by about 50%. The same degree of suppression was obtained after feeding with 23,23,24,24,25-2H5- and 26,26,26,27,27,27-2H6-labeled cholesterol. Were mitochondrial 24- and 27-hydroxylation of importance, one would expect reduced suppression of HMG-CoA reductase when feeding deuterated cholesterol, due to the isotope effects. As this was not the case, it is concluded that neither 24-hydroxylation nor 27-hydroxylation are critical for the cholesterol-induced down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W1648784449,"The biosynthesis of human CD8 glycoprotein in transfected rat epithelial cells produces an unglycosylated precursor, an intermediate species only initially O-glycosylated, and a doublet mature form carrying neutral and sialylated O-linked oligosaccharides with the core-2 structure (Pascale, M. C., Malagolini, N., Serafini-Cessi, F., Migliaccio, G., Leone, A., and Bonatti, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9940-9947). In this study the most relevant post-translational events: dimerization, addition of the first O-linked GalNAc, fulfillment of O-linked chains, as well as expression of involved glycosyltransferases, have been examined and correlated with the localization and transit rate of CD8 through the exocytic pathway. The glycosyltransferase activities measured in rat epithelial cells transfected with human CD8 DNA are entirely consistent with the primary structure assigned to CD8 oligosaccharides. The half-time of appearance of the initially O-glycosylated precursor and mature form was estimated to be 4 and 14 min, respectively, and the half-time for delivery of mature CD8 to the cell surface was found to be about 30 min, indicating a very fast routing. Pulse experiments with [35S]cysteine at 37 degrees C followed by chase-periods at low temperatures showed that folding/dimerization occurs before routing to the Golgi apparatus, whereas the addiction of O-linked GalNAc appears to take place later, very likely in cis-Golgi cisternae. Treatment of cells with monensin accumulated the intermediate CD8 form carrying non-elongated O-linked GalNAc, whereas brefeldin A treatment produced a sialylated glycoprotein species with a mobility faster than the mature CD8. These results indicate that the two drugs affect assembly of O-linked chains at different time of their processing."
https://openalex.org/W1575028420,"The small, leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, are prominent components of many extracellular matrices and are differentially regulated in various tissues. We have examined the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the expression of biglycan and decorin at the protein and mRNA levels in cultured bovine articular chondrocytes. Biglycan protein expression is rapidly turned off after 1-2 days of treatment with RA. In contrast, decorin protein expression is increased 12-18-fold following 3 days of RA treatment. The level of biglycan mRNA was also rapidly reduced upon RA treatment, mirroring the protein expression. The reduction was apparent by 6 h, and, by 4 days, the levels were nearly undetectable. In contrast, decorin mRNA was induced upon treatment with RA. The increase in decorin message levels was first apparent by 24 h, reaching maximum by 2 days, and remained constant through 4 days. The repression of biglycan mRNA displayed equal sensitivity to RA concentrations from 10(-5) to 10(-9) M. Decorin mRNA was induced in a dose-dependent fashion by RA. Retinoic acid at a concentration of 10(-5) M, the highest dose examined, resulted in maximal induction of the message, and control levels were obtained with 10(-8) M. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibited the induction of decorin mRNA, indicating that the induction by RA was a secondary event. In contrast, the repression of biglycan by RA was not significantly altered by cycloheximide, showing that the repression was a direct effect. Actinomycin D inhibited the induction of decorin mRNA, indicating that transcription was required for the induction. Nuclear run-on assays confirmed that RA was regulating biglycan mRNA expression at the transcription level. A 24-h RA treatment decreased the level of transcription of the biglycan gene 5-fold. In contrast, no increase in transcription from the decorin gene could be detected by nuclear run-on assays. Therefore, the elevation in decorin mRNA levels observed after RA treatment was the result of a post-transcriptional event, most likely the consequence of stabilization of the message. This study demonstrates that the genes for these two similar proteoglycans are under very different forms of regulation by RA in chondrocytes.

Three amino acids in the recognition alpha-helix of the DNA-binding domain of the receptor are primarily responsible for this specific DNA binding activity. In this study we analyze in detail how these residues determine the specific DNA binding by studying a series of mutant glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domains containing all combinations of glucocorticoid and estrogen receptor-specific residues at these positions. Statistical analysis of the results enables us to create models describing the association between amino acids and base pairs. Several strategies appear to be used in accomplishing discrimination between the glucocorticoid and estrogen response elements. Single residues (i.e., Val-443 in the glucocorticoid receptor and Glu-439 in the estrogen receptor) appear to form both positive contacts with specific base pairs in the cognate binding site and negative contacts in the non-cognate site. In the glucocorticoid receptor Ser-440 is pleiotropically negative for all sites tested but the negative effect is stronger for the estrogen response element thus contributing to binding site discrimination. Furthermore, combinations of amino acids appear to act synergistically, most often causing a reduction in binding to non-cognate sites."
https://openalex.org/W1599851610,"Cardiac and fast skeletal isoforms of TnC each comprise four putative EF-hand (helix-loop-helix) motifs as potential Ca(2+)-binding sites (sites 1-4), except that site 1 in cardiac TnC is deficient in Ca2+ coordination. In skeletal TnC, the N-terminal sites 1 and 2 are both essential for the trigger mechanism of the contraction switch. However, the mechanism in cardiac muscle is unsettled; it is obscure whether the cardiac site 1 is functionally inert due to calcium deficiency and consequently site 2 is the lone trigger site, or whether sites 1 and 2 perform interactively despite the impairment. These possibilities were addressed by mutagenizing site 1 in skeletal TnC to mimic the cardiac response. In one mutant (STnC-1), two selected Ca(2+)-ligands were abolished. In another (C1/S chimera), 41 N-terminal residues from cardiac TnC were spliced to STnC. The Ca(2+)-binding capacities as well as skinned fiber responses were measured. The STnC-1 derivative failed to switch on contraction. In contrast, the chimeric construct expressed close to full contractile potential in myocardium (74 +/- 3% Po; Po = maximal tension) and also the manifest cardiac phenotype. By devising supplemental chimeric constructs, cardiac-type N-terminal overhang together with cardiac-type EF-hand for site 1 both were found essential for the phenotype. We conclude that cardiac TnC site 1 is actively engaged in the trigger mechanism and in fact dominates the phenotype despite the inability to chelate Ca2+. The N-terminal overhang also participates in this mechanism, which is a novel finding. The conclusion that a non-chelating site functions interactively with a proximal site in cardiac TnC may have wider significance, inasmuch as similar pairings of disparate EF-hands are of common occurrence."

The mineralized cell filaments can be drawn into a fiber that when dried consists of a bacterial thread backbone carrying an inorganic solid. The ratios of organic to inorganic components (by weight) in the stiff brittle materials, called bionites, were: 1.08 for fe(2)bactonite, 1.8 for calbactonite, 2.3 for fe(3)bactonite, and 5 for cu(2)bactonite. X-ray photoelectron spectra suggest that the fe(3)bactonite contains Fe2O3, that calbactonite contains calcium carbonate, and that cu(2)bactonite contains CuCl (Cu I). Acid-base reactions of the bionites are compatible with these identifications. Burning out the organic phase of the febactonites yields a black magnetic material, presumably magnetite. The burnt cubactonite appears to yield elemental Cu(s). Calbactonite upon hydration was able to retain a genetically engineered enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1585863382,"Following elongation of spermatids in mammals, the histones are replaced by a set of basic nuclear transition proteins; in the rat there are four, named TP1-TP4. Of these, TP1 and TP2 are well characterized. Here we report the purification to homogeneity of TP4 from rat spermatids. It is a low molecular mass (about 13-20 kDa) basic protein with arginine and lysine constituting 24 mol % and histidine 2.2 mol %. Its 25 N-terminal amino acids were sequenced, and no sequence homologies with any known protein were found. Polyclonal antibodies raised against it in rabbit did not cross-react with other transition proteins, protamines, or histones. The presence of TP4 during sperm development was monitored by cell separation studies. No TP4 was detected in round spermatids, and along with TP1 and TP2, it is present in step 13-15 spermatids and its amount decreased in steps 16-19. Trace amounts of TP4 were also detected in epididymal sperm. A possible role for TP4 in spermatid and sperm chromatin structure is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510932715,"Incubation of Swiss 3T3 cells with [2-3H]adenine, as in other cell types, reveals the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78 (the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, also known as BiP, the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein), a resident endoplasmic reticulum protein that assists in the processing of proteins destined for secretion or cell surface expression. Here we show that Pasteurella multocida toxin, a potent growth factor for cultured fibroblasts, decreased the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78/BiP to 16 +/- 6% of the control value (n = 23). The action of the toxin occurred after a lag period, was blocked by lysosomotrophic agents, and potentiated by increased incubation time (ED50 4 ng/ml and 1 ng/ml in 4 and 8 h, respectively), thus indicating that the toxin enters the cells to act. Bombesin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) similarly decreased the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78/BiP (ED50 0.5 nM and 2.5 ng/ml, respectively) but acted more rapidly than the toxin. Signaling pathways activated by the toxin, bombesin, and PDGF had effects on the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78/BiP. Thus, activation of protein kinase C alone by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate was partially effective, and down-regulation of protein kinase C attenuated but did not block the action of the toxin, bombesin, and PDGF. Agents that mobilize Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (A23187, ionomycin, and thapsigargin) caused a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78/BiP that was similar in magnitude to that achieved by the toxin, bombesin, and PDGF, implicating a role for inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in the action of the mitogenic agents. The growth factor-induced decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of GRP78/BiP may represent its conversion from an inactive to an active state."
https://openalex.org/W1607660349,"Neuromodulin (also designated GAP-43, B-50, and F-1) is a prominent protein kinase C substrate attached to the membranes of neuronal growth cones during development and to presynaptic membranes in discrete subsets of adult synapses. In this study, we have examined the relationship between the attachment of neuromodulin to membranes and its phosphorylation by protein kinase C. To address this issue, we have compared wild-type and mutant neuromodulins expressed in cells that normally lack the protein. Wild-type neuromodulin expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was associated with membranes, incorporated [3H]palmitic acid, and was phosphorylated in response to phorbol ester treatment. Substitution of serine 41, the in vitro protein kinase C site, abolished the phorbol ester response, indicating that serine 41 serves as the sole protein kinase C phosphorylation site in vivo. Substitution of the putative fatty acylation sites, cysteines 3 and 4, abolished membrane association as well as [3H]palmitic acid labeling of neuromodulin. Fatty acylation therefore appears to serve as the mechanism for anchoring neuromodulin to membranes. Surprisingly, the soluble cysteine substitution mutant was phosphorylated by protein kinase C at a rate indistinguishable from that of the wild-type protein. Therefore, membrane association may not be required for the phosphorylation of neuromodulin by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W198050042,"De novo synthesis of neolacto-series glycolipids has been studied in human cell lines via metabolic labeling of ceramide with [3H]serine. Intense labeling of ceramide mono- and dihexoside glycolipids occurred with labeling of progressively longer chain derivatives with increasing time. Most of the label was recovered in neutral glycolipids with about 5% of the total labeling in the ganglioside fraction. Experiments done using cell treatment with 2.5 micrograms/ml brefeldin A resulted in a stimulation in the total amount of labeling, accumulation of a neutral glycolipid identified as Lc3 due to inhibited transfer of the neolacto-series core chain terminal beta-Gal residue, and a corresponding inhibition of labeling of longer chain neutral glycolipids in all cell lines. Brefeldin A also blocked synthesis of the globo-series precursor, Gb3, longer chain sialylated structures such as IV3NeuAcnLc4, but not de novo GM3 synthesis. Brefeldin A treatment had no effect on cellular beta 1-->3N-acetylglucosaminyl-, beta 1-->4galactosyl-, or alpha 1-->3fucosyltransferase specific activities, nor was it inhibitory in beta 1-->4galactosyltransferase assays in vitro. The results describe brefeldin A-induced blocks in globo- and neolacto-series glycolipid biosynthesis, consistent with differential localization of enzymes in intracellular membranes. In particular, the results suggest that the beta 1-->4galactosyltransferase in these cells is either not redistributed by brefeldin A or is otherwise rendered nonfunctional."
https://openalex.org/W1532907688,"Abstract A novel DNA helicase has been isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This DNA helicase co-purified with replication factor C (RF-C) during chromatography on S-Sepharose, DEAE-silica gel high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Affi-Gel Blue-agarose, heparin-agarose, single-stranded DNA-cellulose, fast protein liquid chromatography MonoS, and hydroxyapatite HPLC. Surprisingly, the helicase could be separated from RF-C by sedimentation on a glycerol gradient in the presence of 200 mM NaCl. The helicase is probably a homodimer of a 60-kDa polypeptide, which by UV cross-linking has been shown to bind ATP. It has a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, with a Km for ATP of 60 microM. The DNA helicase activity depends on the hydrolysis of NTP (dNTP), with ATP and dATP the most efficient cofactors, followed by CTP and dCTP. The DNA helicase has a 5' to 3' directionality and is only marginally stimulated by coating the single-stranded DNA with the yeast single-stranded DNA-binding protein RF-A."
https://openalex.org/W1545195726,"Abstract The export of proOmpA, the precursor of outer membrane protein A from Escherichia coli, requires preprotein translocase, which is comprised of SecA, SecY/E, and acidic phospholipids. Previous studies of proOmpA intermediates (Schiebel, E., Driessen, A. J. M., Hartl, F.-U., and Wickner, W. (1991) Cell 64, 927-939) suggested that the slippage of the translocating polypeptide chain and the high level of ATP hydrolysis, characteristic of the translocation ATPase, were part of a futile cycle. To examine the role of the mature domain of proOmpA in its translocation-dependent ATP hydrolysis, we used chemical cleavage to generate NH2-terminal fragments of this preprotein. Each fragment contained the 21-residue leader region and either 53 or 228 residues of the mature domain (preproteins P74 and P249, respectively). As observed with full-length proOmpA, the of each fragment requires ATP and both the SecA and SecY/E domains of translocase and is stimulated by the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient. The apparent maximal velocities of P74 and proOmpA are similar. While the of P74 and of proOmpA show the same apparent Km for ATP, far less ATP is hydrolyzed during the of P74. Thus, the mature carboxyl-terminal domain of proOmpA has a major role in supporting the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W49728417,"Thioredoxin is a small oxidation-reduction (redox) mediator protein. Its reduction by NADPH is catalyzed by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase. Site-directed mutagenesis has provided forms of the reductase in which Cys135 and Cys138 have each been changed to a serine residue (Prongay, A. J., Engelke, D. R., and Williams, C. H., Jr. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 2656-2664). Cys135 and Cys138 form the redox-active disulfide in the oxidized enzyme. The redox properties of the two altered forms of Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase have been determined from pH 6.0 to 9.0. Photoreduction of TRR(Ser135,Cys138) produces the blue, neutral semiquinone species, which disproportionates (Kf = 0.73) to an apparent maximum of 29% of the total enzyme as the semiquinone. In contrast, the semiquinone formed on TRR(Cys135,Ser138) during a photoreductive titration does not disproportionate and 70% of the enzyme is stabilized as the semiquinione. Reductive titrations have demonstrated that 1 mol of sodium dithionite (2 electrons)/mol of FAD is required to fully reduce TRR(Ser135,Cys138) whereas 2 mol of dithionite/mol of FAD are required to fully reduce TRR(Cys135,Ser138). The oxidation-reduction midpoint potentials for the 1-electron and 2-electron reductions of TRR(Ser135,Cys138) have been determined by NADH/NAD+ titrations in the presence of a mediator, benzyl viologen. The midpoint potential for the 2-electron reduction of TRR(Ser135,Cys138) is -280 mV, at pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C. Thus, the redox potential is similar to that of the FAD/FADH2 couple in the dithiol form of wild type enzyme, -270 mV (corrected to 20 degrees C) (O'Donnell, M. E., and Williams, C. H., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13795-13805). The delta Em/delta pH is -57.1 mV, which corresponds to a proton stoichiometry of 2 H+/2 e-.A maximum of 19% of the enzyme forms a stable semiquinone species during the titration, and the potentials for the oxidized enzyme/semiquinone couple, E2, and the semiquinone/reduced enzyme couple, E1, are -306 and -256 mV, respectively, at pH 7.0 and 20 degrees C. These studies provide evidence that the residue at position 138 exerts a greater effect on the FAD than does the residue at position 135."
https://openalex.org/W1494668971,"Abstract Peptide 11, CDPGYIGSR-NH2, is a segment of laminin which blocks tumor cell invasion. A high affinity laminin receptor in tumor cells is thought to be blocked by the carboxyl-terminal YIGSR, and conformational energy calculations suggest that the glycine in YIGSR allows an important conformational bend. We replaced the YIGSR glycine residue in peptide 11 with either D-alanine or L-alanine to allow or disfavor the proposed glycine bend. We found the Gly7-->D-Ala7 analog to be equal to peptide 11 in inhibiting tumor cell invasion of basement membrane matrix. The Gly7-->L-Ala7 analog was much less capable of invasion inhibition. Two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR was used to study the solution conformations of the peptide 11 analogs. NOESY experiments revealed close NH-NH contacts in peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog, but not in the L-Ala7 analog. Molecular dynamics generated low energy structures with excellent NOE agreement for peptide 11 and its analogs. Both peptide 11 and the D-Ala7 analog, but not the less active L-Ala7 analog, were predicted to have similar bends around Gly7 or D-Ala7. These results suggest that a bend in the YIGSR region of peptide 11 may be important for the binding of laminin to its metastasis-associated receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1484999175,"Abstract Cellular transcription factors play critical roles in regulating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene transcription, although the precise mechanism(s) defining their roles are not well established. Primarily it has been suggested that sequence-specific interaction of trans-activating proteins with cis-acting DNA elements plays a crucial role in regulating the target genes. The negative regulatory element (NRE) of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is one such defined region that has been reported to down-regulate LTR-directed HIV gene expression. Information regarding the role of this region in the regulation of HIV expression is lacking. Here we describe an attempt to further characterize the role of NRE cis-elements and define any sequence-specific interaction with cellular factors. Using gel mobility shift DNA-binding and Southwestern blot assays, we have mapped a distinct region of NRE (-290 to -260, a 30-base pair (bp) domain of NRE-A) sequences of HIV-1 LTR, which recognizes a specific DNA-binding protein from HeLa cell nuclear extracts. This factor is a 38-kDa polypeptide which can be affinity-purified to near homogeneity by this 30-bp specific oligonucleotide in affinity chromatography. The cellular factor from HeLa cell nuclear extract exhibits specific interaction only with the 30-bp NRE-A domain of HIV-1 LTR and acts as a strong transcriptional repressor/inhibitor molecule in the DNA-protein gel binding, as well as in vitro transcriptional studies with the nuclear extracts from cells with productive HIV-1 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a factor recognizing a distinct segment within NRE that has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on transcriptionally active DNA-protein pre-initiation complex formation, suggesting a possible role in HIV-1 gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1514522138,"We have been investigating the role of proteolytic enzymes in the inactivation of peptide neurotransmitters in the marine snail Aplysia. Previous studies (Squire, C. R., Talebian, M., Menon, J. G., Dekruyff, S. D., Lee, T. D., Shively, J. E., and Rothman, B. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 22355-22363) showed that neuroactive fragments of the neurotransmitter alpha-bag cell peptide (alpha-BCP) were rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 0.5-2.7 min) in plasma, hemolymph that had been cleared by centrifugation. Degradation was caused by one or more enzymes resembling mammalian leucine amino-peptidase (LAP, EC 3.4.11.1). In this report we show that three other Aplysia peptide neurotransmitters, beta-BCP(1-5) (Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-His), FMRFa (Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide), and SCPB(1-9) (Met-Asn-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Phe-Pro-Arg-Met-amide) are rapidly degraded (t1/2 = 0.3-2.4 min) in plasma by apparently the same LAP-like enzyme(s). Our findings strongly suggest that the LAP-like enzyme(s), by means of its broad substrate specificity and access to the extracellular spaces of the nervous system in vivo, plays a significant role in the inactivation of many Aplysia peptide neurotransmitters, and they raise the possibility that proteolytic enzymes in the extracellular fluid contribute significantly to the inactivation of peptide neurotransmitters in other animal species."
https://openalex.org/W1531481602,"Abstract The topological location of the nucleotide substrate binding environments on adenylate kinase has been explored with the fluorescent molecule [4-benzoyl]benzoyl-1-amidofluorescein (BzAF) and the nucleotide analog 3'-O-[4-benzoyl]benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), which are site-directed photoaffinity probes that bind covalently at the individual nucleotide sites. The MgBzATP substituted for MgATP as a substrate for this enzyme, whereas BzAF, which is neither a substrate nor a nucleotide, behaved as a competitive inhibitor for each nucleotide site independently. BzAF could be directed specifically to either of the nucleotide sites by near saturation of the second site with its natural nucleotide substrate. Using this second site blocking approach, each nucleotide site, in turn, could be protected competitively from BzAF-induced photoinhibition by the presence of its natural substrate. This strategy showed that under photolysis, the Kd(BzAF) of 0.1 mM (for the MgATP site) and 0.2 mM (for the AMP site) were nearly identical with the Km(app) values determined for MgATP and AMP, respectively. Pseudo first-order photolysis kinetics with [3H]BzAF revealed covalent binding stoichiometries for full inhibition of 1 mol of probe/mol of enzyme at either site. Thus, we prepared the binary complex ([3H]BzAF-enzyme) by photo-labeling the MgATP site-blocked enzyme with [3H]BzAf to 1:1 molar stoichiometry. Tryptic digestion followed by partial sequencing of the [3H]BzAF-labeled enzyme disclosed that BzAF was bound specifically within the peptide span Gly64-->Arg77. This amino acid domain therefore probably constitutes the neighborhood identifiable with AMP binding. Furthermore, we also achieved double photocovalent labeling of adenylate kinase with both photoprobes, by first cross-linking with approximately 1 mol of MgBzATP, followed by approximately 0.9 mol of [3H]BzAF, thus generating a ternary covalent complex. Comparison of the fluorescence of the binary species and the ternary (BzATP-enzyme-[3H]BzAF) complex revealed altered fluorescence emission profiles, which could indicate that a conformational change occurs during formation of the ternary (or transition state) complex."
https://openalex.org/W1540135264,"The DNA photoproduct responsible for the ultraviolet (UV) light-induced -1 frameshift mutation remains unknown. We recently identified a UV photoproduct consisting of a cyclobutane dimer occurring between non-adjacent thymine residues in the same strand, [sequence: see text] and proposed that replication across this unrepaired photoproduct might result in a -1 frameshift mutation since the intervening base is extrahelical. Until now this novel photoproduct has only been identified in single-stranded DNA polymers and does not occur in UV-irradiated double-stranded polymers due to conformational restraint. This observation suggested that this photoproduct could only occur in vivo in chromosomal sites that were single-stranded. In the current work the cis-syn dithymine cyclobutane dimer has been identified in the self-complementary polymer poly[d(A-T)] when UV irradiated in solution conditions (concentrated manganese chloride or 60% ethanol plus trace salts) wherein this polymer remains double-stranded but the double-helix is partially destabilized. Taken together, the current findings suggest that dipyrimidine photoproducts between non-adjacent residues on the same strand could occur in vivo in double-stranded, but partially destabilized, DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1559346579,"We have previously identified a rat hepatonuclear factor, PS-1 that binds to the thyroid hormone responsive gene, S14. To determine whether PS-1 is involved in regulating tissue-specific expression of the S14 gene, we have correlated the DNA binding activity of PS-1 with mRNA-S14 expression in a variety of tissues. Gel retardation analysis revealed a pattern of binding to the recognition site that was characteristic of tissues with high levels of mRNA-S14, a different pattern was found in tissues which do not express the gene. Competition studies using mutant oligonucleotides showed that the first 4 nucleotides and the CAAT motif contained within the PS-1 recognition sequence are essential for protein binding. C/EBP, a CCAAT-transcription factor binds to the PS-1 recognition site thus raising the possibility that both C/EBP and PS-1 may belong to the same family of proteins. Next we used a cell-free transcription assay to measure activity of a template, pS14-GFC(-72), that contained the PS-1 sequence. The pS14-GFC(-72) template was active in hepatonuclear extracts but deletion of or competition with the PS-1 binding sequence rendered the construct inactive. A template containing three PS-1 binding sequences increased S14 promoter activity by 12- to 13-fold. In nuclear extracts from spleen and testis, relative S14 promoter activity was only 2% of that in the liver, this observation mimicked closely in vivo expression of the gene. Mixing together extracts from liver and spleen in varying proportions, prior to incubation with S14 template, yielded a linear increase in S14 promoter activity that correlated with the amount of liver extract in the reaction. This finding is consistent with the absence of an essential factor or factors in spleen that is/are required for S14 promoter activity in vitro. In summary, PS-1 binds to a DNA sequence that contains a CAAT motif and appears to play a critical role in determining tissue-specific activity of the S14 promoter in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1587744241,"Recent studies indicate that viruses may influence polyphosphoinositide levels. This study has examined the effects of vaccinia virus infection on phospholipase C activity. Infection of BS-C-1 cells, an African Green Monkey kidney cell line, or A431 cells, a human carcinoma cell line, with vaccinia virus inhibits receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation. As a consequence, agonist-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in BS-C-1 cells also was inhibited by vaccinia virus infection. Alleviation of the inhibition of phospholipase C activation was observed in vaccinia virus-infected cells treated with cycloheximide without influencing uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with alpha-amanitin, an inhibitor of host mRNA synthesis but not virus mRNA synthesis, failed to alleviate the inhibition of phospholipase C activation. Together these results suggest that a virus-encoded gene product mediates the inhibition of phospholipase C activation without the need of a virus-induced host factor. Analysis of the processes involved in the formation of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ indicate that the vaccinia virus gene product exerts its inhibitory effects at the level of phospholipase C activity. This may occur by either directly reducing the amount of phospholipase C, reducing the specific activity of phospholipase C, or by inhibiting the association of phospholipase C with its substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate."
