Nod2, a third member of the family, was identified. Nod2 is composed of two N-terminal CARDs, a nucleotide-binding domain, and multiple C-terminal leucine-rich repeats. Although Nod1 and Apaf-1 were broadly expressed in tissues, the expression of Nod2 was highly restricted to monocytes. Nod2 induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, which required IKKγ and was inhibited by dominant negative mutants of IκBα, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ. Nod2 interacted with the serine-threonine kinase RICK via a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction. Furthermore, NF-κB activity induced by Nod2 correlated with its ability to interact with RICK and was specifically inhibited by a truncated mutant form of RICK containing its CARD. The identification of Nod2 defines a subfamily of Apaf-1-like proteins that function through RICK to activate a NF-κB signaling pathway.

The structural and functional similarities between Apaf-1 and Nod1 suggest that these proteins share a common molecular mechanism for activation and effector function. In the case of Apaf-1, the WD-40 repeats act as a recognition domain for mitochondrial damage through binding to cytochrome c, allowing Apaf-1 to oligomerize and interact with procaspase-9 through a CARD-CARD homophilic interaction (3Li P.

Analyses with wild type (wt) and mutant forms of both Nod1 and RICK have suggested that Nod1 and RICK act in the same pathway of NF-κB activation, where RICK functions as a downstream mediator of Nod1 signaling (1Bertin J.

Like Nod1, these intracellular R proteins contain N-terminal effector domains linked to a NBD and share with Nod1 the presence of multiple LRRs located C-terminally of the NBD (1Bertin J. Nir W.J.

After specific recognition of pathogen products, these R proteins mediate a defense response associated with metabolic alterations and localized cell death at the site of pathogen invasion (12Dixon M.S.

The LRRs of R proteins are highly diverse and appear to be involved in the recognition of a wide array of pathogen components (11Parniske M. Hammond-Kosack K.E. Golstein C. Thomas C.M. Jones D.A.

The structural homology of Nod1 with plant R proteins suggest that other LRR-containing Nod-1-like molecules may exist in the human genome to allow activation of these molecules by different sets of intracellular stimuli. We report here the identification and characterization of Nod2, another LRR-containing protein with structural and functional similarity to Nod1. These studies indicate that Nod2 activates NF-κB, but unlike Nod1, this new homologue is primarily expressed in monocytes. Nucleotide sequences encoding peptides with homology to Nod1 (GenBankTMaccession numbers AC007728 and AQ534686) were found in the public genomic data base using the TBLASTN program. The coding region of humannod2 was obtained by RT-PCR amplification and 5′ RACE using Nod2-specific oligonucleotide primers cDNA fragments and mRNA from primary mammary tissue as a template. 5′ RACE was performed using a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For PCR, three sets of primers were used: 5′-ATGTGCTCGCAGGAGGCTTTTCAGGCA-3′ and 5′-CGCCTCACCC-ACCACCAGCACAGTGT-3′; 5′-CATGGCTGGACCCCCGCAGAAGAGCCCA-3′ and 5′-CA-TGCCCGGGTTCATCTGGCTCATCCGG-3′; and 5′-GCCATGCCCGGGTTCATCTGGCTCATC-3′ and 5′-TGAGTCGAGACATGGGGAAAGCTGCTTC-3′. For 5′ RACE, the initial primer 5′-AGCAGCTCGACCAGCTGGCTCCTCTGT-3′ was used and the product was PCR amplified with the anchored primer and second Nod2-specific primer: 5′-GACAGGCCCAAGTACCCTTA-TTCCAGA-3′. The resulting cDNA fragments were digested with restriction enzymes and ligated to generate an unique cDNA containing the entire open reading frame of Nod2. The cDNA sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing. A 3.7-kilobase fragment containing the entire Nod2 coding region was radiolabeled by random priming using a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and applied for analysis of human poly(A)+RNA blots from various tissues (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained from heparinized venous blood from healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were separated from red blood cells by brief incubation with hypotonic lysis buffer. The mononuclear cell population was fractionated into lymphocytes and monocytes by adherence to plastic dishes. For RT-PCR analysis, 2 μg of total RNA from each cell preparations were used to generate first strand cDNA using a commercially available kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nod2 cDNA fragments corresponding to the Nod2 coding region were amplified by PCR using two sets of specific primers: P1, 5′-ATGTGCTCGCAGGAGGCTTTTCAGGCA-3′; P2, 5′-CGCCTCACCCACCA-CCAGCACAGTGT-3′; P3, 5′-ATGTGCTCGCAGGAGGCTTTTCAGGCA-3′; and P4, 5′-CG-CCTCACCCACCACCAGCACAGTGT-3′. As a control, a cDNA fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified using the primers 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and 5′-AGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT-3′. The Nod2 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3-HA and pcDNA3-Fpk3-Myc (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol.

To identify novel Nod1/Apaf-1-like molecules, we searched public genomic data bases for genes encoding proteins with homology to Nod1 (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R.

We found a genomic sequence in human chromosome 16 (GenBankTM accession number AC007728) that encodes a peptide with significant homology to the NBD of Nod1. Analysis with GeneFinder of the genomic region predicted a gene encoding a novel protein with significant homology to Nod1. To determine the ends of the coding region, we performed 5′ RACE using an oligonucleotide complementary to sequences encoding the N terminus of the predicted protein and sequenced several expressed sequence tag cDNAs which contain partial sequences of the gene (GenBankTM accession numbers AA775466, AA910520, andAI090427). To amplify the cDNA containing the entire open reading frame, we performed RT-PCR with three sets of primers corresponding to overlapping sequences of the coding region of the gene. The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 1040 amino acids. A BLAST search of protein data bases indicated that the protein encoded by the new open reading frame was most homologous to Nod1 (34% amino acid identity). We termed this protein Nod2 given that is has a high level of homology with Nod1 and thus represents a novel member of the Apaf-1/Nod1 superfamily (Fig. 1). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed two potential in-frame translation initiation sites separated by 81 nucleotides. Further analysis revealed that both translation initiation sites can be utilized in cells, although the longer open reading frame is preferentially used (see below). For simplicity, we refer here to the longer open reading frame as Nod2 and the product encoded by the shorter open reading frame as Nod2b. A BLAST search and domain analyses revealed that Nod2 is composed of two N-terminal CARDs (residues 28–220) fused to a centrally located NBD domain (residues 273–577) containing consensus nucleotide-binding motifs followed by 10 tandem LRRs (residues 744–1020) (Figs. 1 and2). Each of the 10 LRRs of Nod2 contained predicted α helix and β sheet sequences that are consistent with the prototypical horseshoe-shaped structure of LRRs (Ref. 14Kobe B. Deisenhofer B, J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and Fig.2 C). To our knowledge, Nod2 is the first protein to contain two CARDs.Figure 2Alignment of human Nod2 and related proteins.

These BAC clones mapped to chromosome 16 at q12. Comparison of Nod2 cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that the Nod2 gene contains 12 coding exons. 2Y. Ogura, N. Inohara, and G. Núñez, unpublished results. Northern blot analysis showed Nod2 to be expressed as two ∼7.0- and ∼5.5-kilobase transcripts in peripheral blood leukocytes with little or no detectable expression in various human tissues (Fig.3 A). This highly restricted pattern of expression is in contrast to that of Nod1 and Apaf-1 that are expressed in virtually all adult tissues although at different levels (1Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M.

To determine the cells that express Nod2, we fractionated peripheral blood leukocytes into granulocyte, lymphocyte, and monocyte populations and performed RT-PCR analysis with two different sets of oligonucleotide primers complementary to Nod2 coding sequences. The analysis showed that Nod2 was expressed primarily in monocytes (Fig. 3 B). Because the Nod2 sequence contained two potential in-frame translation initiation sites separated by 81 nucleotides (Fig. 3 C), we determined their usage by transfection of a Nod2 construct containing both translation initiation sites into HEK293T cells. Because the difference in size between both predicted Nod2 products is only 27 amino acids, we expressed a C-terminally truncated Nod2 lacking residues 302–1040 to facilitate the identification of the translation initiation sites. As a control, we engineered Nod2 plasmids that express each translation initiation site separately within a canonical Kozak's translation initiation motif. The analysis revealed that both translation initiation sites in the Nod2 open reading frame were used, although the most N-terminal translation initiation codon was more efficient as assessed by immunoblotting of cell extracts with an antibody that recognizes a C-terminal HA tag (Fig. 3 D). Because Nod2 shows the highest homology to Nod1 and the latter protein activates NF-κB, we first tested whether expression of Nod2 activates NF-κB by transfection of Nod2 plasmids into HEK293T cells. Transfection of the wt Nod2 cDNA induced potent activation of NF-κB, as measured with a reporter luciferase construct (see below). In addition, we tested the Nod2b cDNA and obtained similar results to those observed with Nod2.2 We generated a panel of Nod2 mutants to determine the regions of Nod2 that are required for NF-κB activation (Fig.4 A). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that these mutant constructs were expressed when transiently transfected into HEK293T cells (Fig. 4 B). Expression of as little as 3 ng of wt Nod2 induced 18-fold activation of NF-κB (Fig.4 C). Expression of a Nod2 mutant form lacking the LRRs resulted in enhanced NF-κB activation, whereas mutants expressing the LRRs or the NBD alone were inactive (Fig. 4 C). The enhanced activity of the Nod2 mutant lacking the LRRs could not be explained by increased expression of the mutant (Fig. 4 A). Consistent with these results, it was shown previously that deletion of the LRRs of Nod1 and WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 results in enhanced NF-κB activation and increased ability to activate procaspase-9, respectively (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J. Núñez G. J. Biol.

Deletion of the CARDs of Nod2, either singly or in combination, resulted in total loss of NF-κB activity (Fig.4 C). However, expression of both CARDs alone, but not each CARD separately, was sufficient for NF-κB activation (Fig.4 C). Thus, both CARDs of Nod2 are necessary and sufficient for NF-κB activation, suggesting that the CARDs acts as an effector domain in Nod2 signaling. The conserved lysine residue in the P-loop of Nod1 and Apaf-1 is important for the activities of these proteins (2Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino Liu D. Ni J.

Similarly, replacement of the corresponding lysine for arginine in Nod2 resulted in diminished NF-κB activity that was rescued at least in part by deletion of the LRRs (Fig.4 C). We also investigated the ability of Nod2 to induce apoptosis. We found that overexpression of Nod2 did not induce apoptosis by itself but enhanced apoptosis induced by caspase-9 expression.2 These results are similar to those reported for Nod1 and Apaf-1 (1Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R. Grant J.R. Keilty J.J. Gosselin M.L. Robison K.E. Wong G.H. Glucksmann M.A. DiStefano P.S. J. Biol.

A main pathway of NF-κB activation is mediated by IκB kinases (IKKs) resulting in IκB phosporylation and release of cytoplamic NF-κB (16Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To determine whether Nod2 activates an IKK-dependent pathway, Nod2 was coexpressed with mutant forms of IKKα, IKKβ, and IκB that have been shown to act as dominant inhibitors of their corresponding endogenous counterparts and/or the IKK complex (16Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In addition, we used a truncated mutant of IKKγ/Nemo (residues 134–419) that is defective in IKKα and IKKβ binding and acts as an inhibitor of NF-κB activation induced by RIP and RICK (10Inohara N.

The NF-κB activity induced by Nod2 as well as that induced by TNFα stimulation were greatly inhibited by mutant IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, and IκBα (Fig. 5 A). Because RICK has been shown to serve as a downstream target of Nod1 (1Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R. Grant J.R. Keilty J.J. Gosselin M.L. Robison K.E. Wong G.H.

We found that NF-κB activation induced by Nod2 was inhibited by mutant RICK but not by a mutant form of RIP that expresses its death effector domain (Fig. 5 A). The inhibition by the CARD of RICK was specific in that it did not interfere with ability of TNFα to induce NF-κB, an activity that was inhibited by the RIP mutant (Fig. 5 A). To verify that Nod2 acts upstream of the IKK complex to activate NF-κB, we tested the ability of Nod2 to activate NF-κB in parental Rat1 fibroblasts and 5R cells, a Rat1-derivative cell line that is defective in IKKγ, an essential subunit of the IKKs (13Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). We found that Nod2, as well as Nod1 and TNFα, induced NF-κB activity in parental Rat1 cells but not in IKKγ-deficient 5R cells (Fig. 5 B). As a control, expression of IKKβ, which functions downstream of IKKγ, induced NF-κB activation in both Rat1 and 5R cell lines (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that Nod2 acts through IKKγ/IKKα/IKKβ to activate NF-κB. The CARD motif functions as an effector domain that mediates specific homophilic interaction with downstream CARD-containing molecules (17Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because NF-κB activation induced by Nod2 was inhibited by a RICK truncated mutant, we tested whether RICK could act as a direct downstream mediator of Nod2 signaling. To test a physical association between Nod2 and RICK, HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged wt or mutant forms of Nod2 and FLAG-tagged RICK, and cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody revealed that RICK associated with Nod2 (Fig.6 A). The association was mediated by both CARDs of Nod2, because only Nod2 proteins containing both CARDs were capable of interacting with RICK (Fig. 6, A and B). The association of Nod2 with RICK was specific in that Nod2 did not associate with several CARD-containing proteins including Apaf-1, caspase-1, caspase-4, c-IAP-1, c-IAP2, procaspase-9, Bcl-10, RAIDD, and Ced-4 nor with several molecules that activate NF-κB including TRAF-1, TRAF-2, TRAF-5, TRAF-6, RIP, NIK, TRADD, IKKα, IKKβ, or IKKγ.2 To determine the region of RICK that associates with Nod2, mutant forms of RICK expressing the CARD (residues 374–540) or lacking the CARD (residues 1–374) were coexpressed with Nod2, and the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. The analysis showed that only the CARD of RICK coimmunoprecipitated with Nod2 (Fig. 6 C). Thus, Nod2 and RICK associate via a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction. Previous studies showed that the NBD of Nod1 and Apaf-1 mediates oligomerization of these molecules, an activity that is critical for NF-κB and caspase-9 activation, respectively (5Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 6Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Núñez G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In the case of Nod1, its oligomerization appears to promote proximity of RICK and NF-κB activation (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To test a similar role for Nod2, we constructed plasmids to express chimeric proteins in which wt or Nod2 mutants were fused to three tandem repeated dimerization domains of Fpk (Fpk3), which can be oligomerized by the cell-permeable ligand AP1510 (18MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the chimeric Fpk3-Nod2 constructs were expressed when transfected in HEK293T cells (Fig.7 A). Because wt Nod2 alone induces NF-κB activation, we expressed suboptimal amounts of the chimeric Fpk3-Nod2 constructs into HEK293T cells. Under these experimental conditions, expression of Nod2-Fpk3 induced NF-κB activation in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig.7 B). Consistent with the results shown in Fig.4 C, enforced oligomerization of both CARDs but not each CARD singly induced NF-κB activation. Similarly, NF-κB activation induced by a Nod2 P-loop mutant lacking the LRRs (K305RΔLRR), which have reduced ability to induce NF-κB activation, was enhanced by enforced oligomerization (Fig. 7 B). A Nod2-Fpk3 construct lacking the LRRs induced NF-κB activation in the absence and presence of AP1510 (Fig. 7 B). The latter result might be explained by our observations that Nod2 lacking the LRRs has enhanced activity to self-associate and induce NF-κB (Ref. 10Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar and Fig. 4 C). To demonstrate that Nod2 can function in monocytic cells, we transfected Nod2 constructs into HL60 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Similarly to the case of HEK293T cells, transient expression of Nod2 induced NF-κB activation in monocytic HL60 cells (Fig. 7 C, left panel). Furthermore, enforced oligomerization of wild type Nod2-Fpk3 or CARDs-Fpk3 was sufficient for NF-κB activation in monocytic HL60 cells (Fig. 7 C,right panel). We have shown that Nod2 is a member of the Nod1/Apaf-1 family that activates NF-κB through interactions with its N-terminal CARDs, as these domains were necessary and sufficient for NF-κB activation. Nod2 associated with RICK via a homophilic CARD-CARD interaction. The NF-κB-inducing activity of Nod2 correlated with its ability to associate with RICK and was inhibited by a RICK mutant, suggesting that RICK is a direct downstream target of Nod2. Thus, the signaling pathways of both Nod1 and Nod2 appear to utilize RICK as a downstream mediator of NF-κB activation. In contrast to Nod1, two tandem CARDs are present in the N terminus of Nod2, and both were required for association with RICK and NF-κB activation. To our knowledge, Nod2 is the first molecule to contain two CARDs. The molecular basis underlying the requirement of both CARDs of Nod2 for RICK binding remains unclear. The presence of both CARDs may enhance the affinity for the CARD of RICK. Another possibility is that upon an initial interaction involving a CARD of Nod2 and the CARD of RICK, Nod2 may undergo a conformational change that allows the second CARD to associate with high affinity to RICK. The intermediate region of RICK associates with IKKγ (10Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), providing a direct link between Nod1/Nod2 and the IKK complex. Consistent with this model, we have shown that NF-κB activation induced by Nod2 as well as that induced by Nod1 required IKKγ and was inhibited by dominant negative forms of IKKγ, IKKα, and IKKβ. The functional role for the LRRs of Nod1 and Nod2 remains unclear. The LRR is a repeated protein-protein interaction module that is presumably involved in the activation of Nod1 and Nod2 by upstream signals. In the case of plant NBD/LRR-containing R proteins, their LRRs appear to be important for the recognition of pathogen components, and their N-terminal domains appear to mediate a signaling cascade that regulates gene expression (11Parniske M.

Recent results indicate that Nod1 and Nod2 can confer responsiveness to bacterial components, suggesting that these proteins are functional counterparts of plant R proteins (20Inohara, N., Ogura, Y., Chen, F. F., Muto, A., and Núñez, G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, in pressGoogle Scholar). Because both Nod1 and Nod2 activate NF-κB, their LRRs may act to recognize a different set of intracellular stimuli that mediate Nod1 and Nod2 oligomerization and association with RICK. Consistent with this model, Nod1 and Nod2 conferred a different pattern of response to bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides (20Inohara, N., Ogura, Y., Chen, F. F., Muto, A., and Núñez, G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, in pressGoogle Scholar), suggesting that they are activated by different microbial stimuli. Because Nod2 is expressed primarily in monocytes, Nod2 might serve as an intracellular receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharides and/or other bacterial products transducing signals in the monocyte/macrophage that lead to activation of NF-κB and transcription of regulatory genes.

The domains of the S1S2 ligand binding core are expanded in the apo state and contract upon ligand binding with the extent of domain separation decreasing in the order of apo > DNQX > kainate > glutamate ≅ AMPA. These results suggest that agonist-induced domain closure gates the transmembrane channel and the extent of receptor activation depends upon the degree of domain closure. AMPA and glutamate also promote a 180° flip of a trans peptide bond in the ligand binding site. The crystal packing of the ligand binding cores suggests modes for subunit–subunit contact in the intact receptor and mechanisms by which allosteric effectors modulate receptor activity."

The extent to which adult visual cortical neurons can exhibit changes in orientation selectivity is unknown.

In contrast to the common view of adaptation as a passive process by which responses around the adapting orientation are reduced, we show that changes in orientation tuning also occur due to response increases at orientations away from the adapting stimulus. Adaptation-induced orientation plasticity is thus an active time-dependent process that involves network interactions and includes both response depression and enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1983699648,"It is an open question whether new synapses form during hippocampal LTP. Here, we show that late-phase LTP (L-LTP) is associated with a significant increase in numbers of synaptic puncta identified by synaptophysin and N-cadherin, an adhesion protein involved in synapse formation during development. During potentiation, protein levels of N-cadherin are significantly elevated and N-cadherin dimerization is enhanced. The increases in synaptic number and N-cadherin levels are dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and protein synthesis, both of which are also required for L-LTP. Blocking N-cadherin adhesion prevents the induction of L-LTP, but not the early-phase of LTP (E-LTP). Our data suggest that N-cadherin is synthesized during the induction of L-LTP and recruited to newly forming synapses. N-cadherin may play a critical role in L-LTP by holding nascent pre- and postsynaptic membranes in apposition, enabling incipient synapses to acquire function and contribute to potentiation."

We studied recycling properties of RRP vesicles through differential retention of FM1-43 and FM2-10 and by varying the time window for FM dye uptake. Both approaches indicated that vesicles residing in the RRP underwent rapid endocytosis (tau approximately 1s), whereas newly recruited RP vesicles were recycled slowly (tau approximately 30 s). With repeated challenges (hypertonic or electrical stimuli), the ability to release neurotransmitter recovered 10-fold more rapidly than restoration of FM2-10 destaining. Finding neurotransmission in the absence of destaining implied that rapidly endocytosed RRP vesicles were capable of reuse, a process distinct from repopulation from the RP. Reuse would greatly expand the functional capabilities of a limited number of vesicles in CNS terminals, particularly during intermittent bursts of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2192499142,"Because nitric oxide (NO) is a highly reactive signaling molecule, chemical inactivation by reaction with oxygen, superoxide, and glutathione competes with specific interactions with target proteins. NO signaling may be enhanced by adaptor proteins that couple neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) to specific target proteins. Here we identify a selective interaction of the nNOS adaptor protein CAPON with Dexras1, a brain-enriched member of the Ras family of small monomeric G proteins. We find that Dexras1 is activated by NO donors as well as by NMDA receptor–stimulated NO synthesis in cortical neurons. The importance of Dexras1 as a physiologic target of nNOS is established by the selective decrease of Dexras1 activation, but not H-Ras or four other Ras family members, in the brains of mice harboring a targeted genomic deletion of nNOS (nNOS−/−). We also find that nNOS, CAPON, and Dexras1 form a ternary complex that enhances the ability of nNOS to activate Dexras1. These findings identify Dexras1 as a novel physiologic NO effector and suggest that anchoring of nNOS to specific targets is a mechanism by which NO signaling is enhanced."

Mutant rhodopsins bearing zero, one (S338), or two (S334/S338) phosphorylation sites generated single-photon responses with greatly prolonged, exponentially distributed durations. Responses from rods expressing mutant rhodopsins bearing more than two phosphorylation sites declined along smooth, reproducible time courses; the rate of recovery increased with increasing numbers of phosphorylation sites.

We further demonstrate that an AB can be elicited by both temporal and spatial distractor interference on an attended target and that both of these interference mechanisms activate the same neural circuit.

Long-term synaptic depression (LTD) is absent at the parallel fiber synapses of the mutants, even though the structure and function of these synapses otherwise appear normal. This loss of LTD is associated with selective changes in IP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling in spines and can be rescued by photolysis of a caged Ca2+ compound.

Though mutations in several photoreceptor signaling proteins have been implicated in triggering this process, the molecular events relating light activation of rhodopsin to photoreceptor death are yet unclear. Here, we uncover a pathway by which activation of rhodopsin in Drosophila mediates apoptosis through a G protein-independent mechanism. This process involves the formation of membrane complexes of phosphorylated, activated rhodopsin and its inhibitory protein arrestin, and subsequent clathrin-dependent endocytosis of these complexes into a cytoplasmic compartment. Together, these data define the proapoptotic molecules in Drosophila photoreceptors and indicate a novel signaling pathway for light-activated rhodopsin molecules in control of photoreceptor viability."

Furthermore, we show that the accumulation of these complexes triggers apoptotic cell death and that the observed retinal degeneration requires the endocytic machinery.

These interactions depend on specific arrangements of variably sulfated glucosaminyl residues (GlcNAc, GlcN,1 and GlcNS) and glucuronic (GlcA) and iduronic acids. The assembly of these sequences proceeds in a stepwise manner as follows. (i) The chains initiate by formation of the linkage tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ, on serine residues of core proteins; (ii) the chains elongate by alternating the additions of GlcNAcα1,4 and GlcAβ1,4 residues; (iii) the chains are modified initially by N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of subsets of GlcNAc residues, (iv) adjacent d-GlcA residues undergo C5-epimerization to l-iduronic acid, and (v) sulfation occurs at C2 of the uronic acid residues and at C6 and C3 of glucosaminyl residues. In this scheme, GlcNAcN-deacetylation and N-sulfation creates the prerequisite substrate needed for the later modification reactions (reviewed by Rodén (2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 264-371Google Scholar)). These reactions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes designated the GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (NDSTs). Three NDST isozymes have been identified in vertebrates, whereas only single orthologs are known in Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans (3Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

In D. melanogaster, loss of NDST (sulfateless) results in unsulfated chains and defective signaling by multiple growth factors and morphogens (12Lin X.H. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M.

In mice, targeted disruption of NDST1 results in neonatal lethality due to pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory distress (15Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Liver heparan sulfate is also affected in composition, consistent with the widespread expression of NDST1 (10Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NDST2 mRNA is also highly expressed in most tissues (10Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S.

However, mice lacking NDST2 develop and reproduce normally but show fewer connective tissue-type mast cells. Those cells that remain have an altered morphology and severely reduced amounts of stored histamine and mast cell proteases (17Humphries D.E. Wong G.W. Friend D.S. Gurish M.F. Qiu W.T. Huang C.F.

In contrast to NDST1 null mice, tissue heparan sulfates of NDST2 null mice appear to be unaffected. Murine mutants in NDST3 have not yet been described but are currently under development. 2K. Grobe, J. Aikawa, and J. D. Esko, unpublished results. Studies of a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant defective in NDST1 (pgsE-606) showed that this isozyme accounts for ∼50% of theN-deacetylated/N-sulfated glucosaminyl residues in this system (19Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bame K.J. Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. Biochem.

Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remainder arise from the action of NDST2, the only other isozyme expressed by Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The observation that NDST1 null mice accumulate partially undersulfated chains in tissues supports the idea that multiple isozymes contribute to the formation of heparan sulfate chains (16Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The quantitative contribution of NDST3 is unknown but its more restricted pattern of expression in mice suggests it may play an important role in the development or physiology of specific organs (e.g. brain, liver, and kidney) (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Extensive analysis of public genome data bases suggested the existence of a fourth member of the NDST family. Subsequent cDNA cloning led to the identification of a new member of the vertebrate NDST gene family, designated NDST4. A preliminary report of the clone has appeared in abstract form (23Aikawa J. Esko J.D. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 40Google Scholar). We now report the full-length sequence of NDST4 and show that the four members of the NDST family have clear differences in distribution and enzymatic properties. Different combinations of the isozymes may account for some of the differences seen in heparan sulfates from various tissues. The nucleotide sequence of human NDST3 was used as a probe to search The Institute of Genome Research (TIGR) library of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) end sequencing data base. BAC clone 2608.A.5, 2177.H.9, and 183.D.15 for hNDST3, hNDST4, and mNDST4, respectively, were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. or Research Genetics, Inc. DNA was prepared using the Plasmid DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the company's protocol. 5′- and 3′-RACE was performed using an adaptor-ligated library of human fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH) essentially as described previously (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′ portion was prepared by cDNA amplification using a primer consisting of nucleotides 2368–2392 (hNDST4–1R, 5′-tagagggtctttctgctcagggaag-3′), anchor primer 1 (AP1), and Advantage2 polymerase (CLONTECH) according to the touch-down PCR protocol (30 cycles). An aliquot (one-fourth) of this PCR was subjected to a subsequent nested PCR (20 cycles) using a primer consisting of nucleotides 2341–2365 (NDST4–1R-GSP1, 5′-ctcaaaatactggtgggccagttgc-3′) and AP1 followed by a second nested PCR (20 cycles) using a primer consisting of nucleotides 2281–2306 (NDST4–1R-GSP2, 5′-gctctgcacaaagttgaccaagttc-3′) and anchor primer 2 (AP2). For the 3′ portion, cDNA was first amplified using a primer consisting of nucleotides 1894–1917 (NDST4–1F-GSP3, 5′-tgcactggaacatggaataccaatc-3′) and AP1 followed by a nested PCR (20 cycles) using a primer consisting of nucleotides 2088–2133 (NDST4–1F-GSP4, 5′-tcctccctcgacagacttgtgggttg-3′) and anchor primer AP2 (CLONTECH). The DNA products were gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The nucleotide sequence was determined using Applied Biosystems, Inc. DNA sequencers 370 and 377-18. To prepare mouse NDST4, a PCR (60 cycles) was performed using a mouse brain cDNA library as the template (CLONTECH). cDNA was amplified using a primer consisting of nucleotides 1–27 (mNDST4–1F, 5′- acatgaatgttgggaaggaaaactgg-3′) and 2706–2732 (mNDST4–2R, 5′- tctccagtgctatctcactttctgcag-3′) with Advantage2 polymerase (CLONTECH). The DNA products were gel-purified and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). Preparation of cDNA for mouse NDST1, NDST2, and NDST3 were performed by PCR and will be described elsewhere. 3J. Aikawa and J. D. Esko, unpublished results. Nucleotide sequences of NDSTs were aligned using ClustalW and edited manually. Phylogenetic trees were built employing the Neighborhood Joining method of the program PAUP v4.00. For RT-PCR analysis in mouse tissues, normalized cDNA was obtained from CLONTECH (Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel). PCR was performed as described above, running 29 and 35 cycles for mNDST1–4. For the specific amplification of each mNDST, specific primers were used as follows: mNDST1–1F (5′-accacagccagccagaacgcttgtg-3′) and -1R (5′-agctgcgctcctctcccttactgtc-3′), mNDST2–1F (5′-tgcaacattccagtgtgggctgatggc-3′) and -1R (5′-atgacattagagaggccaggccacagg-3′), mNDST3–2F (5′-tgtgtttcctgtgagtccagatgtgtg-3′) and -2R (5′-attgtcctcctcacttccatcagcctg-3′), and mNDST4–1F (5′-aacaggaaatgacacttattgaaacg-3′) and-1R (5′-actttggggcctttggtaatatg-3′) corresponding to mNDST1 (nucleotides 3104–3128 and 3520–3544 of M92042 (rat NDST1), mNDST2 (nucleotides 2630–2656 and 3142–3168 of U02304), mNDST3 (nucleotides 1–27 and 335–361 of AF221095), and mNDST4 (nucleotides 216–242 and 711–733 ofAB036838), respectively. Murine NDST1–4 DNA fragments coding for the soluble form of the respective enzyme (starting at residue 43 from the N terminus) were ligated into pRK5F10PROTA (Glycomed, Inc.) and transfected into COS7 cells (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies, Inc.). The soluble NDSTs were secreted as protein A fusion proteins into the medium. After purification on IgG-Sepharose (Sigma), protein integrity and expression levels were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were estimated by silver staining samples and comparing the intensity of the chimeras to standard amounts of bovine serum albumin. NDST1–4 protein or protein A (500 ng) was used for each assay. Duplicate measurements were performed for each enzyme, and the signal obtained in the protein A control was subtracted from the values. GlcNAc N-deacetylase activity was measured using [acetyl-3H]heparosan prepared fromEscherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide (19Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bame K.J. Reddy R.V. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12461-12468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, and 1 × 105 cpm [3H]heparosan. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 volumes of 0.2 m HCl, 1 volume of 0.1 m acetic acid, and 1 volume of water. [3H]Acetic acid was recovered by extracting the sample three times with 1 volume of ethyl acetate. An aliquot of the pooled fractions (0.5 ml) was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. GlcN N-sulfotransferase activity was measured by the incorporation of 35SO4 from PAPS to heparosan or N-desulfated heparin (19Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bame K.J. Reddy R.V. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12461-12468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 105 cpm [35S]PAPS were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 25 μg of heparosan or N-desulfated heparin, and 10 μm nonradioactive PAPS in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 0.5 mEDTA, and 2 mg of chondroitin sulfate A was added to the reaction as carrier. The sample was applied to a small column (0.5 ml) of DEAE-Sephacel prepared in a disposable pipette tip and washed 3 times with 10 ml of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 0.2m NaCl. The labeled chains were eluted using the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The concentration of acceptor was slightly greater than theK m value determined previously for NDST1 (22Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of human NDST3 and -4 were determined by in situfluorescent hybridization (FISH, Genome Systems Inc.). BAC DNA tagged with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP by nick translation was hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). Specific hybridization signals were detected by fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies. The N-sulfotransferase domain of human NDST1 (PDB:1NST) was used as a template for modeling the corresponding domains of the human and mouse isozymes (24Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) using the Swiss PDBviewer v.3.5. and the program POV-Ray. The following nucleotide sequences were employed: mNDST1 (AF074926), hNDST1 (U36600), mNDST2 (AF074925), hNDST2 (U36601), mNDST3 (AF221095), hNDST3 (AF074924), mNDST4 (AB036838), hNDST4 (AB036429). Accession numbers refer to the GenBankTM/DDBJ/EMBL data bases. Using the nucleotide sequence of human NDST1 (26Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), NDST2 (27Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and NDST3 (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we examined a human genome data base prepared in BAC. This led to the identification of BAC clone 2177.H.9 (Fig. 1), in which a segment of 183 nucleotides showed 87% identity to human NDST3. The deduced amino acid sequence of the region was 92% identical to exon 6 in human NDST1 and NDST2 (27Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The region was flanked by possible intron-exon junctions (ttcagATCAG–GGCAGgtaac; nucleotides of the putative exon are printed in capital letters), supporting the idea that this sequence represented an authentic exon (28Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, RT-PCR was performed using two primers, hNDNST4–1F and -1R, which bounded this region (Fig. 1). DNA products of the predicted length (∼180 base pairs) were produced, and the identity of nine independent clones was confirmed by sequence analysis (data not shown), suggesting that the gene was transcribed into mRNA. To obtain the full-length cDNA, we first isolated the 5′ portion employing 5′-RACE. Five independent clones were selected from the products, and their sequence indicated a possible initiation codon at nucleotide 679. The 5′-ends of the RACE products were identical in two clones (pCR34–1, clone 1 and 5), whereas the nucleotide sequences of the other three started 312 nucleotides downstream. In addition, two clones (pCR34–1, clone 5 and 6) possessed a deletion of 129 nucleotides (nucleotides 1813–1941). These sequences were not bounded by nucleotides ordinarily seen at splice junctions (TTTCCtcaca–ggcccCACAT and TGGCAgaatc–acaggAACAA), suggesting that they were produced by artificial deletion during PCR. The alternative 5′-end at nucleotide 312, however, may be relevant since a CAAT and TATA box exist at nucleotides 217 and 226 in the human sequence, and comparable promoter elements exist in the mouse. In contrast, the more upstream start site does not apparently contain a nearby TATA sequence in the genomic clone. Additional studies will be required to show if these two transcription start sites are separately regulated, but the presence of a TATA-box for the shorter transcript and a TATA-less promoter for the longer transcript point toward possible differential regulation of expression. The 3′-coding region of NDST4 was produced by 3′-RACE. DNA products were obtained after two rounds of PCR, and three individual clones were analyzed. Combining the nucleotide sequences of 5′- and 3′-RACE products yielded the full-length human cDNA containing an open reading frame of 2625 nucleotides coding for a 872-amino acid residue protein, which was designated NDST4. The isolation of a cDNA coding for mouse NDST4 was performed by PCR (Fig. 1). The forward primer was designed according to the genomic sequence of exon 1, including the start codon of mNDST4, whereas the sequence of the reverse primer mNDST4–2R corresponded to nucleotides 3281–3307 of human NDST4.3 The full-length cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 872 amino acids, showing 95.9% identity to that of hNDST4. Murine cDNAs for NDST1, NDST2, and NDST3 were also obtained in a similar manner.3 Alignment of NDST4 with murine NDST1-3 demonstrated 70.4, 66.4, and 80.3% amino acid identity, respectively (Fig.2). A hydropathy profile indicated that, like the other NDSTs, NDST4 is a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail of 12–13 amino acids and a putative transmembrane region of 22 amino acids, which is followed by a region that varies significantly among all four NDSTs. The NDST4 protein sequence also contained the two highly conserved PAPS binding motifs present in other sulfotransferases (KTGTT beginning at residue 603 and the segment bounded by residues 690–710 (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of hNDST4 and hNDST3 was examined by fluorescencein situ hybridization using their respective BAC DNA clones as probes. On the basis of size, morphology, and banding pattern, specific labeling of the long arm of chromosome 4 was observed. A subsequent experiment cohybridizing a biotin-labeled probe specific for the centromere of chromosome 4 with genomic DNA of either NDST3 or NDST4 was performed. Eighty metaphase cells were analyzed, of which 68 and 74 exhibited specific labeling for NDST3 and NDST4, respectively. Measurement of 10 specifically labeled chromosomes demonstrated that NDST4 and NDST3 were located at positions that were 44 and 49% of the centromere-to-telomere total distance of chromosome 4q, an area corresponding to band 4q25–26 and 4q26–27, respectively (Fig.3). Analysis of the human genome indicates that NDST3 and NDST4 are ∼300 kilobases apart. Human NDST1 and NDST2 were previously shown to map to chromosome 5q32–33 and 10q22, respectively (27Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of NDST4 and the other NDSTs was examined in various mouse tissues by RT-PCR (Fig.4). The relative level of expression of NDST4 was modest in comparison to the other NDSTs, with virtually no PCR products detectable under conditions where NDST1 and NDST2 products were abundant (11Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). With higher amplification, NDST4 was found in adult brain and throughout embryonic development. NDST3 was expressed strongly in brain and more so at embryonic day 11 than at other stages of development. With greater amplification, message was detected in adult heart, kidney, muscle, and testis but not in other tissues. The significance of these different expression patterns is difficult to evaluate given that message levels may not necessarily correspond to levels of protein expression. Selective tissue-specific effects have been observed after ablating NDST1 (pulmonary insufficiency) and NDST2 (effects restricted to connective tissue mast cells) in the mouse, but these transcripts are broadly expressed (15Fan G.

Therefore, understanding the contribution of NDST3 and NDST4 to heparan sulfate synthesis in particular tissues will require similar genetic experiments, which are currently under way.2 The contiguous chromosomal location of NDST3 and NDST4 and their high sequence homology suggested that they might have diverged by duplication after separation of the ancestral gene from another that gave rise to NDST1 and NDST2. A similar explanation has been provided to explain the relationship of GlcN 3-O-sulfotransferases (29Shworak N.W. Liu J.A. Petros L.M. Zhang L.J. Kobayashi M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5170-5184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and fucosyltransferases, FUC5 and FUC6, which are located in tandem orientation on chromosome 19, only 13 kilobases apart from each other (30Nishihara S. Nakazato M. Kudo T. Kimura H. Ando T. Narimatsu H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the origins of the four NDSTs, ClustalW analysis of the enzymes of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, mouse, and human was used to predict their evolutionary relationship (Fig. 5). Based on the dendrogram, three gene duplication events occurred in vertebrates, giving rise to four isozymes common to both mouse and human without any further radiation. The first duplication gave rise to two branches, followed by another gene duplication in each branch. NDST3 and -4 are more closely related to each other than to NDST1 or -2, which cluster together somewhat more weakly. Therefore, the duplication of the common ancestral gene of NDST1 and -2 may have preceded the duplication event that gave rise to NDST3 and -4. The NDST locus appears to be ancient since heparan sulfate of similar design is present in organisms as old as C. elegans 4Bulik, D. A., Wei, G., Toyoda, H., Konishita-Toyoda, A., Waldrip, W. R., Esko, J. D., Robbins, P. W., and Selleck, S. B. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97,10838–10843 andHydra (32Sarras Jr., M.P. Meador D. Zhang X.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which emerged more than 500 million years ago. The phylogenetic relationships remain the same when amino acid sequences are used for constructing the tree, which points toward a restriction on the evolution of these enzymes possibly due to their essential functions. Recently the crystal structure for the sulfotransferase domain of NDST1 was solved (24Kakuta Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10673-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The high degree of sequence similarity of the NDSTs allowed us to model the structure of the sulfotransferase domains of NDST2–4 using NDST1 as a template. Modeling each murine and human isozyme revealed a very similar overall pattern of surface charge and shape in the domain that constitutes the substrate binding cleft and the active site. However, this pattern differed significantly across the four isozymes in both species (Fig. 7). Amino acids in the putative substrate binding cleft were responsible for many of the differences, and most of these residues were located in a random coil defined by amino acids 633–649 (human NDST1). The relevant variable residues include 638 (E/S/K/K for NDST1, -2, -3, and -4, respectively), 648 (G/S/R/G), 649 (H/P/N/N), 682 (D/D/H/H), 721 (D/G/E/E), and 743 (K/A/E/D) (Fig. 6). Fig.7 shows more clearly that the variable residues line the putative binding cleft for the acceptor oligosaccharide. Many of the substitutions are nonconservative and change charged residues that might interact with the substrate. Since the crystal structure for the N-deacetylase domain is not yet available, we cannot make any conclusions about variation of its active site.Figure 6Molecular modeling of the human NDST-1 sulfotransferase domain. Ribbon diagram showing the substrate binding cleft of the sulfotransferase domain of hNDST1 (NCBI protein data base: PDB:1NST). Relevant variable amino acids between the four isozymes are shown, which might determine different substrate binding preferences among the NDSTs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the above findings, we predicted that NDST4 should have both GlcNAcN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities, but that the characteristics of the isozyme might differ significantly from the other NDSTs. To test this possibility, a soluble chimera of murine NDST4 and protein A was expressed in COS cells and assayed for each activity. Like NDST1-3, NDST4 is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity (Table I). However, NDST4 was peculiar in that the N-deacetylase activity was very low when compared with recombinant murine NDST1-3 produced under identical conditions. In contrast, the sulfotransferase activity was similar to NDST1 and NDST2. NDST3 had relatively higher N-deacetylase activity and the lowest sulfotransferase activity of all four isozymes. Similar results were obtained when the deacetylation assay was performed in the presence of PAPS (data not shown). The ratio ofN-deacetylase to N-sulfotransferase activities differed dramatically among the four isozymes (Fig.8). As shown previously, the ratio was greater in NDST2 than in NDST1, but the differences were most dramatic in NDST3 and NDST4, which appeared to have complementary ratios.Table IMurine NDST4 N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase activityIsozymeN-DeacetylaseN-SulfotransferasemNDST116000 ± 130057000 ± 1900mNDST220000 ± 140027100 ± 300mNDST37700 ± 1000700 ± 100mNDST41700 ± 10045000 ± 2600About 500 ng of recombinant NDST4 was assayed forN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity in duplicate.

Open table in a new tab About 500 ng of recombinant NDST4 was assayed forN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity in duplicate. The values for total cpm ± S.E. after subtraction of background are shown. These data show that NDST3 and NDST4 differ dramatically from NDST1 and NDST2 in activity and expression pattern. Based on these findings and modeling data, we propose that substrate recognition by the various isozymes may vary significantly, giving rise to the different catalytic efficiencies depending on the degree of sulfation/epimerization of the substrate. All four NDSTs apparently have the capacity to work on unmodified chains (i.e. N-acetylheparosan), but the relatively poor deacetylation activity of NDST4 would suggest that this is not the normal substrate. One possibility is that the deacetylase domain of NDST4 may prefer chains that have already undergone some degree of sulfation and uronic epimerization, and therefore greater activity would be observed with more heparin-like substrates. The presence of additional basic residues in the binding cleft of NDST4 is consistent with this possibility. Alternatively, NDST4 may add sulfate groups to glucosaminyl residues that were deacetylated by one of the other NDSTs (e.g. NDST3) but left unmodified. Heparan sulfates and heparin are known to contain a small proportion of N-deacetylated glucosamine units (33Van Den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellén L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M.

Additional studies with defined, chemically modified substrates are needed to determine which of these possibilities are correct. A more detailed analysis of substrate specificity and saturability is clearly needed as well. Previous models for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate suggest that modification of the chains initiates by the action of one or more NDSTs working on newly made, unmodified chains composed of alternating GlcNAcα1,4 and GlcAβ1,4 units (reviewed in Ref. 2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 264-371Google Scholar). The formation of the N-deacetylated/N-sulfated glucosaminyl residues creates the preferred substrate for the C5 epimerase that converts adjacent d-GlcA residues to l-iduronic acid. O-Sulfation reactions then occur at C2 of the uronic acids and C6 and C3 of the glucosaminyl residues. Studies of mutant cell lines confirm that this sequence of events most likely occursin vivo as well (19Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bame K.J. Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 21Bame K.J.

Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). The striking differences in activity of NDST3 and -4 are consistent with a model in which some of the isozymes act on previously modified sequences. Thus,N-deacetylation of certain residues may be catalyzed by one enzyme and then acted upon by another. An iterative process like this could guide the formation of unique sequences in heparan sulfates with specific ligand binding properties. Exploring the function of these new NDSTs will ultimately require a combination of biochemistry and genetics to alter the expression of these isozymes in animals and cells and to assess how the changes affect the composition of the chains. These studies are currently under way.2 We thank Drs. Xiaomei Bai and Ge Wei, Jan Castagnola, and all other members of Esko group for their helpful suggestions.

https://openalex.org/W2143638197,"In humans, repeated alcohol consumption leads to the development of tolerance, manifested as a reduced physiological and behavioral response to a particular dose of alcohol. Here we show that adult Drosophila develop tolerance to the sedating and motor-impairing effects of ethanol with kinetics of acquisition and dissipation that mimic those seen in mammals. Importantly, this tolerance is not caused by changes in ethanol absorption or metabolism. Rather, the development of tolerance requires the functional and structural integrity of specific central brain regions. Mutants unable to synthesize the catecholamine octopamine are also impaired in their ability to develop tolerance. Taken together, these data show that Drosophila is a suitable model system in which to study the molecular and neuroanatomical bases of ethanol tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2010210270,"The binding of chemokines to glycosaminoglycans is thought to play a crucial role in chemokine functions. It has recently been shown that stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), a CXC chemokine with potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity, binds to heparan sulfate through a typical consensus sequence for heparin recognition (BBXB, where B is a basic residue KHLK, amino acids 24–27). Calculation of the accessible surface, together with the electrostatic potential of the SDF-1α dimer, revealed that other amino acids (Arg-41 and Lys-43) are found in the same surface area and contribute to the creation of a positively charged crevice, located at the dimer interface. GRID calculations confirmed that this binding site will be the most energetically favored area for the interaction with sulfate groups. Site-directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance-based binding assays were used to investigate the structural basis for SDF-1α binding to heparin. Among the residues clustered in this basic surface area, Lys-24 and Lys-27 have dominant roles and are essential for interaction with heparin. Amino acids Arg-41 and Lys-43 participate in the binding but are not strictly required for the interaction to take place. Direct binding assays and competition analysis with monoclonal antibodies also permitted us to show that the N-terminal residue (Lys-1), an amino acid critical for receptor activation, is involved in complex formation. Binding studies with selectively desulfated heparin, heparin oligosaccharides, and heparitinase-resistant heparan sulfate fragments showed that a minimum size of 12–14 monosaccharide units is required for efficient binding and that 2-O- andN-sulfate groups have a dominant role in the interaction. Finally, the heparin-binding site was identified on the crystal structure of SDF-1α, and a docking study was undertaken. During the energy minimization process, heparin lost its perfect ribbon shape and fitted the protein surface perfectly. In the model, Lys-1, Lys-24, Lys-27, and Arg-41 were found to have the major role in binding a polysaccharide fragment consisting of 13 monosaccharide units.

For example, leukocyte migration along the endothelium surface, and migration into the tissues at the site of inflammation, is believed to depend on the local presentation of chemokines by such cell surface-expressed GAGs (16Tanaka Y.

However, SDF-1 has many other functions that extend well beyond leukocyte migration, and in many respects, both SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 have several unusual features. For example, mice that lack either the SDF-1 or the CXCR4 gene die in utero, with a number of defects including severe developmental abnormalities, indicating that this chemokine clearly has important roles beyond chemotaxis (21Tachibana K. Hirota S. Iizasa H. Yoshida H. Kawabata K. Kataoka Y. Kitamura Y. Matsushima K. Yoshida N. Nishikawa S. Kishimoto T. Nagasawa T.

CXCR4, also widely distributed, raises the question of the specificity of this system. HS-protein interaction has selectivity on itself (25Lindahl U. Kusche-Gulberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and, although the functional aspects of the SDF/HS interaction have not been reported to date, HS could be of critical importance in orchestrating the cellular response to this chemokine, as has already been reported for other ligands involved in the developmental process (26Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In addition to these physiological functions, SDF-1 is a potent inhibitor of the cellular entry of CXCR4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus, a process that relies on the occupation and internalization of CXCR4 (20Oberlin E.

In view of the general importance of HS in the activity of chemokines, the chemokine-HS interaction represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (28McFadden G. Kelvin D. Biochem.

In addition, an obvious application of the knowledge obtained on the SDF-1-HS complex is the engineering of drugs blocking human immunodeficiency virus CXCR4 coreceptor. This study was thus undertaken to characterize further the SDF-1α-HS complex. It has been previously demonstrated that SDF-1α binds selectively to HS and heparin (a chemically related GAG) and that the combined substitution of Lys24, His25, and Lys27 by serine residues produces a chemokine unable to bind HS (29Amara A.

The present study investigates the effect of single mutations in this domain and the relative importance of several additional residues of the protein for HS/heparin recognition. From these results, the heparin-binding site was located on the crystal structure of SDF-1α, and a docking study was undertaken. The structural features of heparin required for efficient binding were also investigated, and these data, together with those obtained from the directed mutagenesis analysis, were combined with a molecular modeling approach to propose a three-dimensional model of the interaction between SDF-1α and heparin.

Selective biotinylation at the C-terminal position was achieved by incorporating an extra lysine residue, bearing a 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioscocyclohex-1-ylidene)- ethyl protective group, on the side chain.

Samples were dialyzed against distilled water and quantified by colorimetric assay, using the Bitter and Muir method (32Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5120) Google Scholar). HS from Chinese hamster ovary cells were prepared essentially as described (33Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were cultured for 48 h in Ham's F-12 medium, without glucose and supplemented with 10 μCi/ml of [3H]glucosamine. The labeled material was purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, and the proteoglycan peak was sequentially digested with chondroitinase ABC (1 unit/ml, 3 h at 37 °C) and papain (1 mg/ml, 16 h at 65 °C). The digest, consisting of intact HS chains, was re-purified on a small DEAE-Sephacel column. Eluted material was desalted and freeze-dried. Low pH nitrous acid treatment of a small aliquot of this material, analyzed by Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography, gave a pattern of depolymerization typical of HS (34Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HS was then digested with heparitinase (20 milliunits/ml) for 4 h at 30 °C, and heparitinase resistant oligosaccharides were purified on a 1 × 150 cm Bio-Gel P-10 column. Each chemokine (5 μl of 2 × 10−4m solution) was injected on a 1-ml Hitrap heparin column and submitted to gradient elution from 0.15 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, over 20 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Detection was carried out at 280 nm. Size-defined heparin (9 kDa) was biotinylated at the reducing end as described and immobilized on a Biacore sensorchip (29Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M. Virelizier J.L. Delepierre M. Baleux F. Lortat-Jacob H. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23916-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For this purpose, two flow cells of a F1 sensorchip were activated with 50 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodi-imine/N-hydroxy-succinimide, 0.05 m1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodi-imine/N-hydroxy-succinimide before injection of 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.2). Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically, this procedure permitted coupling of ∼2000–2500 resonance units of streptavidin. Biotinylated heparin (5 μg/ml) in HBS containing 0.3 m NaCl was then injected over the surface to obtain an immobilization level of 50 resonance units. Flow cells were then conditioned with several injections of 1 m NaCl. For binding assays, six different SDF-1α concentra- tions in HBS were injected at 50 μl/min onto the heparin surface for 3 min, after which the complexes formed were washed withrunning buffer. The sensorchip surface was regenerated with a 2-minpulse of 1 m NaCl in HBS, and the binding curves were analyzed as described (29Amara A. Lorthioir O. Valenzuela A. Magerus A. Thelen M. Montes M.

To analyze the binding of oligosaccharide to protein in solution, a modified version of the filter binding assay of Maccarana and Lindahl (35Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, SDF-1α (0.25 μg) and biotinylated heparin (0.1 μg/ml) were coincubated for 2 h at room temperature in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Competition assays were performed by adding unlabeled oligosaccharides to the mixture. SDF-1α plus any bound biotinylated heparin were then trapped on the surface of a nitrocellulose membrane by drawing the incubation mixture through the membrane with a vacuum-assisted dot-blot apparatus. The nitrocellulose filters were washed twice with 200 μl of TBS and blocked with 5% dry milk in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The biotinylated heparin bound to SDF-1α was revealed by incubating the membrane with extravidin peroxidase (0.5 μg/ml) and ECL detection reagents. The membrane was exposed to film, and chemiluminescent signals were quantified by densitometry. Competitors included size-defined, heparin-derived, or synthetic oligosaccharides and selectively de-sulfated heparin. For direct binding assay, SDF-1α (1.5 μg) was incubated with 3H-labeled HS oligosaccharides (10,000 cpm), and bound complexes were trapped with a nitrocellulose filter as described above. The protein-bound HS was dissociated from the filter with 2 m NaCl and measured in a β-scintillation counter. Monoclonal antibodies (K15C and 4H4) were coated on a 96-well plate (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. The coated mAbs were used to capture biotinylated SDF-1α (1 μg/ml) that had been preincubated with either octasaccharide (dp8) or tetradecasaccharide (dp14). Bound biotinylated SDF-1α was then revealed with extravidin peroxidase (0.7 μg/ml) and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of 4 m H2SO4, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. The coordinates of the crystal structure of the N33A variant of the SDF-1α dimer (36Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) were taken from the Protein Data Bank (code 1A15). The amino acids missing on one of the monomers (Lys-1 to Tyr-7 on the N-terminal moiety and Ala-65 to Asn-67 on the C-terminal moiety) were built by homology with the other monomer. The missing side chains of two amino acids, i.e.Val-3 and Arg-8, were modeled. The geometry of the modeled amino acids was optimized using the Tripos force field (37Clark M. Cramer III., R.D. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) in the Sybyl molecular modeling package. 2SYBYL Tripos Associates, Suite 303, 1699 S. Hanley Rd., St. Louis, MO 63144. Hydrogen atoms were added and optimized, and partial atomic charges were derived using the Pullman procedure. Connolly surfaces of both monomer and dimer were calculated using the MOLCAD program (39Waldherr-Teschner M. Goetze T. Heiden W. Knoblauch M. Vollhardt H. Brickmann J. Post F.H. Hin A.J.S. Advances in Scientific Visualization. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1992: 58-67Crossref Google Scholar) from the Sybyl package. The GRID program (40Goodford P.J. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar) was used to predict the most favorable anchoring position for a sulfated oligosaccharide. The probe used in the calculation was the charged oxygen of a sulfate or phosphate group. The grid spacing was set to 1 Å. The coordinates of heparin were taken from the NMR-derived structures (41Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Jones C. Davies D.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1HPN). Both structures, differing by the ring shape of the l-iduronic acid residues that can be either 2S0 or1C4, were considered in the present study. They are referred to in this paper as 2S0 heparin and 1C4 heparin. Atom types and partial charges were defined according to the PIM energy parameters for carbohydrates (42Imberty A. Bettler E.

Indian Academy of Sciences and Universities Press, Hyderabad1999: 392-409Google Scholar) to be used within the Tripos force field (37Clark M. Cramer III., R.D. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The torsional angles of the glycosidic linkages between atom C-1 of residuei and atom C-4 of residue j were defined as Φ = Θ(O-5iC-1iO-1iC-4j) and Ψ = Θ(C-1iO-1iC-4jC-5j). The signs of the torsion angles were in agreement with the IUPAC-IUPAB conventions (43IUPAC-IUB, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 145, 1971, 405, 621.Google Scholar). The heparin chain was extended to 7 repeating units (i.e. 14 monosaccharides) to obtain a length longer than the dimension of the SDF-1α dimer positively charged cleft. The heparin chain was located exactly parallel to the cleft. Since the heparin dimer included a pseudo axis of symmetry perpendicular to the basic cleft, it was not necessary to consider the two possible directions (i.e.location of the nonreducing end) for the heparin chain. Different starting orientations were generated by rotating the chain along its long axis by 4 steps of 90°, while keeping it at a van der Waals contact distance from the protein surface. Due to the 2-fold symmetry of the heparin ribbons, this was equivalent to combining a 90° rotation and translation of half a repeating unit. This procedure was applied to both 2S0 heparin and1C4 heparin, thereby generating 8 start docking modes. The geometry of each of the complexes was optimized by several cycles of energy minimization. The hydrogen atoms and pendent groups were first optimized. Finally the whole heparin moiety together with the side chain of the amino acids in the positively charged cleft were fully optimized. All energy calculations were performed with the Tripos force field (37Clark M. Cramer III., R.D. van den Opdenbosch N. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 982-1012Crossref Scopus (2770) Google Scholar) together with energy parameters specially derived for carbohydrates (44Pérez S. Meyer C. Imberty A. Pullman A. Jortner J. Pullman B. Modeling of Biomolecular Structures and Mechanisms. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Drodrecht, Netherlands1995: 425-454Google Scholar) and sulfated derivatives (42Imberty A. Bettler E. Karababa M. Mazeau K. Petrova P. Pérez S. Vijayan M. Yathindra N. Kolaskar A.S. Perspectives in Structural Biology. Indian Academy of Sciences and Universities Press, Hyderabad1999: 392-409Google Scholar). To evaluate the energy of interaction, the complex was also optimized with the heparin at a distance of 50 Å from the protein, therefore with no intermolecular interaction. As with most chemokines, SDF-1α is monomeric in solution (45Crump M.P. Gong J.H. Loetscher P. Rajarathnam K. Amara A. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Virelizier J.L. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6996-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) but a dimeric association is observed upon crystallization (36Dealwis C. Fernandez E.J. Thompson D.A. Simon R.J. Siani M.A. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The possibility that this dimer could result from a packing artifact in the crystalline state is unlikely because first, the same dimer has been observed in another crystal form of SDF-1α (46Ohnishi Y. Senda T. Nandhagopal N. Sugimoto K. Shioda T. Nagai Y. Mitsui Y. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and second, the observed dimer interface involves the first β-strand of the chemokine as found in all CXC chemokines analyzed to date. The Connolly surfaces of both the SDF-1α monomer and dimer have been calculated here. When looking for a possible site of binding for the negatively charged heparin fragment, the most positively charged area in the monomer takes the shape of a crest, formed mainly by amino acids Lys-27, Arg-41, Lys-24, and Lys-43 (Fig.1 a). Amino acids Lys-24, His-25, and Lys-27, present in the first β-strand of the chemokine, constitute a typical BBXB heparin-binding motif (47Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have already been shown to be collectively involved in heparin recognition. Fig. 1 b displays the Connolly surface of the dimer color-coded for the projection of the electrostatic potential. In the crystallographic dimer, the two crests formed by residues 24, 27, 41, and 43 are on the sides of the protein-protein interface, each of them forming the edge of a deep, straight crevice (Fig. 1 b). Arg-41 and Lys-43, present in the second β-strand of the chemokine, protrude within the BBXB cluster and appear to be ideally located to participate in the interaction. On the opposite side, His-25 is buried at the dimer interface and is more likely to play a role in protein-protein association rather than"

Mutations in the genes encoding these glycoproteins result in two related human bone dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, which together comprise a “bone dysplasia family.” It has been proposed that these diseases have a similar pathophysiology, which is highlighted by the fact that mutations in either the COMP or the type IX collagen genes produce multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, suggesting that their gene products interact. To investigate the interactions between COMP and type IX collagen, we have used rotary shadowing electron microscopy and real time biomolecular (BIAcore) analysis. Analysis of COMP-type IX collagen complexes demonstrated that COMP interacts with type IX collagen through the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen and the C-terminal domain of COMP. Furthermore, peptide mapping identified a putative collagen-binding site that is associated with known human mutations.

There are over 200 unique well characterized phenotypes (2International Working Group on Constitutional Diseases of Bone Am. J. Med.

These result in the skipping of exon 3, leading to an in-frame deletion of 12 amino acid residues from equivalent regions of the COL3 domain of the α2(IX) and α3(IX) chains.

Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and that abnormal collagen fibril morphology is associated with COMP gene mutations provided a rationale for investigating potential interactions between COMP and type IX collagen.In this paper, we show that COMP can interact with type IX collagen. These interactions are mediated through the C-terminal domain of COMP and the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen. A putative collagen-binding domain in COMP is located between residues 579 and 595, and mutations in this region are likely to disrupt these interactions. Overall, these data provide evidence that disruptions to molecular interactions between two key components of the cartilage extracellular matrix might produce distinct clinical phenotypes that share a common disease pathophysiology and belong to the same bone dysplasia family.DISCUSSIONCOMP and type IX collagen are important structural components of the cartilage ECM with fundamental roles in collagen fibrillogenesis, tissue development, and homeostasis. We have used rotary shadowing electron microscopy and BIAcore analysis to show that COMP can interact with native type IX collagen. These interactions are mediated through the C-terminal domain of COMP and the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen (NC1–4). Using BIAcore, we demonstrated qualitatively that COMP can interact with native type IX collagen and to a certain extent the pepsin-derived HMW fragment but not the LMW fragment. These data collectively suggest that each of the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen are involved in interactions with COMP. The use of recombinant Ct-COMP in BIAcore studies confirmed the rotary shadowing EM findings that the C-terminal domain of COMP mediates interaction with type IX collagen. Furthermore, the use of peptide inhibition assays aided in the identification of a putative collagen-binding site between residues 579 and 595 of COMP. This region of COMP has previously been shown to contain mutations resulting in skeletal dysplasia, providing a direct link between these fundamental interactions and human disease.Overall, these findings support recent data indicating that the C-terminal domain of COMP can bind to collagen I/II and procollagen I/II molecules in the presence of divalent cations (15Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Using a solid-phase binding assay, Rosenberg and colleagues determined that interactions between COMP and collagen I/II displayed a preference for Zn2+, with binding saturated at 0.5 mm. They subsequently characterized these interactions further using BIAcore and rotary shadowing transmission electron microscopy with 1 mmZn2+ (15Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments to study interactions between COMP and type IX collagen, which appear also to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of COMP in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+. Whereas Rosenberg and co-workers demonstrated that COMP bound to the collagenous regions of types I and II collagen at four sites located at 0 (C-terminal), 126, 206, and 300 nm (N-terminal) (15Rosenberg K. Olsson H. Morgelin M. Heinegard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20397-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we have shown that COMP appears to bind exclusively to the noncollagenous domains of type IX collagen. We used BIAcore analysis to confirm that type II collagen interacted with COMP in our system and then used peptide inhibition assays to show that this binding could also be specifically disrupted with peptide 579–595 (but not 713–725). These data suggest that type I, II, and IX collagen interactions are mediated through the same (or closely located) region of the C-terminal domain of COMP.The majority of mutations in the COMP gene are within exons encoding the calcium binding (type III repeat) domain (9Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M.G.

Montufar-Solis D. Decker G. Lawler J. Daniels K. Duke P.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of chondrocytes from PSACH cartilage shows the accumulation of type IX collagen along with COMP in the RER, suggesting that interactions, possibly specific, occur between these molecules prior to secretion (19Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bachinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). During pentamerization, by random association, 97% of all pentamers will contain at least one abnormal monomer. The relative effect of different numbers of abnormal monomers on COMP pentamer secretion has yet to be determined, but immunohistochemical analysis of cartilage has shown that there is a significant reduction in the level of extracellular COMP that would be available for interactions with collagen (19Maddox B.K. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Charbonneau N.L. Morris N.P. Ridgway C.C. Boswell B.A. Sussman M.D. Horton W.A. Bachinger H.P. Hecht J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30993-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, electron microscopy of labrum ligament from a PSACH patient with a mutation in the type III domain of COMP (G465S) shows a generalized disruption to tissue organization and abnormal collagen fibril morphology. Longitudinal sections show severe disruption to the orientation of collagen fibrils and differences in individual fibril thickness, whereas transverse sections show variable fibril diameter, irregular fibril surface, and numerous fused fibrils.2Overall, these data confirm a role for COMP in collagen fibrillogenesis and matrix assembly.We hypothesize that disruptions to COMP-type IX collagen interactions are a secondary component of the pathophysiology of the “PSACH-MED bone dysplasia family.” Disruption to these interactions can occur by one of two mechanisms; either mutations occur within the binding sites of these molecules or there is a reduction in the amount of one (or both) of these molecules in the ECM of cartilage. We have shown that a collagen binding site is located between residues 579 and 595, a region of COMP previously shown to contain mutations that cause either PSACH or MED. Four mutations have been identified within five residues, E583K, T585R, T585M, H587R, (10Briggs M.D. Mortier G.R. Cole W.G. King L.M. Golik S.S. Bonaventure J. Nuytinck L. De Paepe A. Leroy J.G.

Genet. 1998; 80: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that the motif EGTFH plays an important role in COMP-collagen interactions. We suggest that mutations in exons encoding the C-terminal domain of COMP are likely to have a less deleterious effect on the structure and folding of abnormal COMP, therefore not preventing its secretion into the extracellular matrix. In this case, interactions with type IX collagen are likely to be disrupted by mutations in the collagen-binding site of COMP.The cell matrix pathology of MED, resulting from eitherCOL9A2 or COL9A3 mutations, is unresolved. Previously, analysis of cartilage ultrastructure has suggested that there was no retention of abnormal type IX collagen within the RER of chondrocytes from some affected patients (38van Mourik J.B. Buma P. Wilcox W.R. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1998; 22: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, recent data have shown that inclusion bodies can be present with a lamellar structure similar to that seen in chondrocytes from patients with COMP gene mutations (23Bonnemann C.G. Cox G.F. Shapiro F. Wu J.J. Feener C.A. Thompson T.G. Anthony D.C. Eyre D.R. Darras B.T. Kunkel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1212-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, we have reported that a specific mutation in COL9A2 results in the degradation ofCOL9A2 mRNA from the mutant allele, and undoubtedly this would result in an overall reduction in type IX collagen within the ECM (24Holden P. Canty E.G. Mortier G.R. Zabel B. Spranger J. Carr A. Grant M.E. Loughlin J.A. Briggs M.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 31-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that although several different mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of MED, all of them are likely to result in an ECM deficient in type IX collagen, thus disrupting important interactions between COMP and type IX collagen.In conclusion, we have shown that COMP interacts with type IX collagen and have identified the domains in each of these proteins that mediate these interactions. High resolution structural studies will be needed to map the binding sites with precision. Disruption to these interactions is likely to define a pathogenetic mechanism in a human bone dysplasia family, and this finding has major implications in understanding the cell matrix pathology of human skeletal dysplasias. The skeletal dysplasias are a diverse group of genetic diseases affecting primarily the development of the osseous skeleton, and range in severity from relatively mild to severe and lethal forms (1Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Rimoin D.L. Connor J.M. Pyeritz R.E. Emery and Rimoin's Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics. 3rd Ed. 2. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1997: 2779-2816Google Scholar). There are over 200 unique well characterized phenotypes (2International Working Group on Constitutional Diseases of Bone Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 79: 82-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and many of these conditions have been grouped into “bone dysplasia families” on the basis of similar clinical and radiographic presentation with the supposition that they will share a common disease pathophysiology (3Spranger J. Pathol. Immunopathol. Res. 1988; 7: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). While there has been great progress in identifying many of the genes involved in these diseases (4Mundlos S. Olsen B.R. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Dreyer S.D. Zhou G. Lee B. Clin. Genet. 1998; 54: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we still have a very limited understanding of the precise cell matrix pathology of individual phenotypes and the relationship between pathogenetic mechanisms within specific bone dysplasia families. Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH)1and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) comprise a bone dysplasia family; they are clinically similar diseases characterized by varying degrees of short-limbed dwarfism, joint laxity, and early onset degenerative joint disease (1Rimoin D.L.

As a model, we used serotonergic Retzius neurons of leech that allow for combined amperometrical and morphological analyses of quantal transmitter release. We find that the transmitter amount released by a SSV varies proportionally to the volume of the vesicle, suggesting that serotonin is stored at a constant intravesicular concentration and is completely discharged during exocytosis. Transmitter discharge from LDCVs shows a higher degree of variability than is expected from their size distribution, and bulk release from LDCVs is slower than release from SSVs. On average, differences in the transmitter amount released from SSVs and LDCVs are proportional to the size differences of the organelles, suggesting that transmitter is stored at similar concentrations in SSVs and LDCVs."

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and it involves a cascade of reactions including E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Ub is first activated by an activating enzyme (E1) to form a high energy thiolester bond between Ub and E1 and is then transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2). The E3s or Ub protein ligases are the components responsible for specific substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to the target protein. Therefore, the E3s can provide specificity to the Ub system.Two recent genetic studies using Cbl-b gene-targeted mice showed that Cbl-b deficiency can change the signaling thresholds: Cbl-b deficiency uncouples T-cell proliferation and interleukin 2 production from the costimulation of CD28, and the gene-targeted mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity or become highly susceptible to exogenous antigen-induced autoimmune diseases (14Bachmaier K.

These studies suggest a critical role of Cbl-b in the regulation of T-cell activation thresholds and hence in the maintenance of a balance between immunity and tolerance. In Cbl-b-deficient T cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation and/or activation of Vav, a GDP/GTP exchange factor, are significantly enhanced (14Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying Cbl-b-mediated negative regulation of Vav remains to be determined.Previous studies have shown that PI3-K, which phosphorylates PI lipid at the D3 position of the inositol ring to form active lipid second messengers, regulates the exchange activity of Vav through the binding of the active lipid products to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Vav (16Han J.

A loss of function mutation (G306E) at this domain of Cbl, which disrupts its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases, can also abrogate its Ub ligase activity toward these kinases (7Levkowitz G.

However, a corresponding mutation at Cbl-b (G298E) did not affect its activity to promote p85 ubiquitination, suggesting that the amino-terminal variant SH2 domain of Cbl-b is dispensable for Ub conjugation to p85. Rather, we showed that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region and, more specifically, the distal proline-rich sequences of Cbl-b are required for efficient p85 ubiquitination. Thus, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which the Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal region can also recruit target proteins and, with the help of the RING finger, induce the transfer of Ub to them.Our finding that the Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal region can recruit protein substrates is consistent with the recent crystal structural study on Cbl RING finger and an E2, Ub-conjugating enzyme H7 (10Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In this complex, the active cysteine of Ub-conjugating enzyme H7, which forms a thiol-ester bond with Ub, is on the opposite side of the complex relative to the binding site for tyrosine kinase binding domain (amino-terminal domain). Therefore, a substrate that associates with the carboxyl-terminal region would presumably allow an easy transfer of Ub to the substrate. To further support our model, we recently found that the Cbl carboxyl-terminal region could also recruit protein substrates such as Stat5 and that the RING finger and the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region are sufficient for promoting Stat5 ubiquitination. 2H.-Y. Wang, D. Fang, L. Qiu, Y. Altman, C. Elly, and Y.-C. Liu, unpublished data. In fact, the Cbl family proteins including those from C.elegans or Drosophila are well conserved in the amino-terminal variant SH2 domain and the RING finger domain (3Lupher Jr., M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), whereas the carboxyl-terminal regions between Cbl and Cbl-b are more divergent, and some Cbl family members (Sli-1, D-Cbl, and Cbl-3) lack or contain only a short form of the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. Because both Cbl and Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal regions contain several protein interaction motifs, it is conceivable that differential recruitment of protein substrates by the carboxyl-terminal region would provide diversity and specificity to Cbl- and/or Cbl-b-mediated protein ubiquitination.The SH3 domain of p85 recognizes a consensus proline-rich motif: RXX RPLPPLPP (28Rickles R.J.

Inspection of the Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal region did not find a perfect match for this consensus sequence. We attempted but failed to map the exact binding motif in the distal proline-rich sequences, suggesting that more than one proline-rich motif is required for the interaction with the SH3 domain of p85. In support of this notion, it was previously shown that the proximal proline-rich stretches in Cbl, rather than one proline-rich motif, mediate the interaction with Grb2 (29Donovan J.A. Ota Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26369-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).The SH3 domain of p85 has been shown to mediate interaction with the proline-rich sequence of another p85 molecule to form a p85 heterodimer (30Harpur A.G.

We have shown here that the p85 SH3 domain can also interact with Cbl-b proline-rich sequences, which results in p85 ubiquitination promoted by Cbl-b E3 Ub ligase. Thus, our study suggests a novel role for the SH3 domain of p85 in mediating its ubiquitination.Polyubiquitination of protein substrates by the Ub system targets them for degradation by the 26S proteasome (11Hochstrasser M.

However, modification of biological functions through ubiquitination of protein substrates without proteolysis has been reported recently in several systems, including regulation of transcription by transcription factor (33Kaiser P. Flick K. Wittenberg C. Reed S.I. Cell. 2000; 102: 303-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or ubiquitination-dependent processing of precursor proteins (27Hoppe T.

In consideration of the fact that the protein levels of Cbl-b-binding proteins do not change in Cbl-b-deficient T cells such as Zap-70, Lck, or even Vav (14Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I.

Nature. 2000; 403: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), it can be postulated that Cbl-b, as an E3 Ub ligase, may play a general role in functional regulation of its target proteins through ubiquitination in a protein degradation-independent manner. The present work provides us with a molecular basis for our ongoing study on how Cbl-b-promoted ubiquitination of p85 could affect its biological function. Cbl-b and its close mammalian homologue, Cbl, consist of an amino-terminal variant SH21domain, a RING finger, and a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain with potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (1Langdon W.Y.

Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that Cbl-b and Cbl function as adaptor proteins by interacting with other critical signal molecules, including the variant SH2 domain-dependent interaction with cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases or intracellular protein tyrosine kinases such as Syk and Zap-70 and the carboxyl-terminal region-dependent interaction with Grb2, 14-3-3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), Vav, and Crk-L (3Lupher Jr., M.L.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have shown that Cbl family proteins including those from Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans attenuate intracellular signaling induced by the engagement of cell surface receptors. One mechanism for this negative role is Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases (5Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is now understood that Cbl functions as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase whose RING finger recruits a Ub-conjugating enzyme, E2, and whose SH2 domain recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases for Ub conjugation (7Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is an important cellular process that involves ligation of a protein substrate with Ub, thereby marking it for degradation by the 26S proteasome (11Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 12Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 13Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and it involves a cascade of reactions including E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Ub is first activated by an activating enzyme (E1) to form a high energy thiolester bond between Ub and E1 and is then transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2). The E3s or Ub protein ligases are the components responsible for specific substrate recognition and for promoting Ub ligation to the target protein. Therefore, the E3s can provide specificity to the Ub system. Two recent genetic studies using Cbl-b gene-targeted mice showed that Cbl-b deficiency can change the signaling thresholds: Cbl-b deficiency uncouples T-cell proliferation and interleukin 2 production from the costimulation of CD28, and the gene-targeted mice develop spontaneous autoimmunity or become highly susceptible to exogenous antigen-induced autoimmune diseases (14Bachmaier K.

These studies suggest a critical role of Cbl-b in the regulation of T-cell activation thresholds and hence in the maintenance of a balance between immunity and tolerance. In Cbl-b-deficient T cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation and/or activation of Vav, a GDP/GTP exchange factor, are significantly enhanced (14Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T. Oliveira dos Santos A. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Itie A. Le J. Ohashi P.S. Sarosi I. Nishina H. Lipkowitz S. Penninger J.M.

Nature. 2000; 403: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cbl-b negatively regulates T-cell signaling by inhibiting Vav activation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Cbl-b-mediated negative regulation of Vav remains to be determined. Previous studies have shown that PI3-K, which phosphorylates PI lipid at the D3 position of the inositol ring to form active lipid second messengers, regulates the exchange activity of Vav through the binding of the active lipid products to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Vav (16Han J.

However, a corresponding mutation at Cbl-b (G298E) did not affect its activity to promote p85 ubiquitination, suggesting that the amino-terminal variant SH2 domain of Cbl-b is dispensable for Ub conjugation to p85. Rather, we showed that the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region and, more specifically, the distal proline-rich sequences of Cbl-b are required for efficient p85 ubiquitination. Thus, our results suggest a novel mechanism by which the Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal region can also recruit target proteins and, with the help of the RING finger, induce the transfer of Ub to them.Our finding that the Cbl-b carboxyl-terminal region can recruit protein substrates is consistent with the recent crystal structural study on Cbl RING finger and an E2, Ub-conjugating enzyme H7 (10Zheng N.

In this complex, the active cysteine of Ub-conjugating enzyme H7, which forms a thiol-ester bond with Ub, is on the opposite side of the complex relative to the binding site for tyrosine kinase binding domain (amino-terminal domain). Therefore, a substrate that associates with the carboxyl-terminal region would presumably allow an easy transfer of Ub to the substrate. To further support our model, we recently found that the Cbl carboxyl-terminal region could also recruit protein substrates such as Stat5 and that the RING finger and the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region are sufficient for promoting Stat5 ubiquitination. 2H.-Y.

However, modification of biological functions through ubiquitination of protein substrates without proteolysis has been reported recently in several systems, including regulation of transcription by transcription factor (33Kaiser P.

In consideration of the fact that the protein levels of Cbl-b-binding proteins do not change in Cbl-b-deficient T cells such as Zap-70, Lck, or even Vav (14Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I.

The present work provides us with a molecular basis for our ongoing study on how Cbl-b-promoted ubiquitination of p85 could affect its biological function. The results in this report demonstrated that Cbl-b acts as an E3 Ub ligase by interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-K and promoting its ubiquitination. A functional RING finger is essential for the Ub ligase activity toward p85, whereas the well-conserved amino-terminal variant SH2 domain is dispensable for this event. We further demonstrated that the distal proline-rich sequences in Cbl-b and the SH3 domain of p85 are required for the efficient interaction and subsequent Ub conjugation to p85. Our data suggest a novel role for Cbl-b in regulating T-cell activation by inducing p85 ubiquitination. Recent genetic studies on Cbl-b-deficient T cells showed that the activation of Vav is increased in these cells, which was proposed to be responsible for costimulation-independent cytokine production and cell proliferation (14Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T. Oliveira dos Santos A. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Itie A. Le J. Ohashi P.S. Sarosi I. Nishina H. Lipkowitz S. Penninger J.M.

This finding is supported by a study showing that coexpression of Cbl-b and Vav inhibits the nucleotide exchange activity of Vav (25Bustelo X.R. Crespo P. Lopez-Barahona M. Gutkind J.S. Barbacid M.

Our efforts failed to prove that Vav is a direct target for Cbl-b E3 Ub ligase activity, even after repeated experiments (data not shown). A recent study showed that Vav could be ubiquitinated by the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, a component of elongin Ub ligase complex. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 interacts with Vav and induces its ubiquitination and degradation (26De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although it cannot be ruled out that Vav is a target for Cbl-b E3 ligase activity, we favor a model in which suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 is the primary E3 ligase component for Vav, and Cbl-b may indirectly regulate Vav activation. We then investigated the possibility that Cbl-b regulates the upstream regulators for Vav activation. One of the well-established regulators is PI3-K, whose lipid product can bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of Vav and activates Vav nucleotide exchange activity (16Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Cbl-b induces Ub conjugation to p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3-K, which is dependent on its RING finger domain and distal proline-rich sequences, suggesting that Cbl-b acts as an E3 Ub ligase for p85. Besides PI3-K, Src kinases can also regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in synergy with PI3-K (16Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R.

Although we did not address a potential role for Cbl-b on Src kinases in this study, our data support a model in which Cbl-b indirectly regulates Vav activation by promoting Ub conjugation to p85. Previous studies on Cbl have focused on the functional role of its amino-terminal variant SH2 domain in targeting the substrate proteins such as cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (5Miyake S.

https://openalex.org/W1986340461,"Neurons elaborate dendrites with stereotypic branching patterns, thereby defining their receptive fields. These branching patterns may arise from properties intrinsic to the neurons or competition between neighboring neurons. Genetic and laser ablation studies reported here reveal that different multiple dendritic neurons in the same dorsal cluster in the Drosophila embryonic PNS do not compete with one another for dendritic fields. In contrast, when dendrites from homologous neurons in the two hemisegments meet at the dorsal midline in larval stages, they appear to repel each other. The formation of normal dendritic fields and the competition between dendrites of homologous neurons require the proper expression level of Flamingo, a G protein-coupled receptor-like protein, in embryonic neurons. Whereas Flamingo functions downstream of Frizzled in specifying planar polarity, Flamingo-dependent dendritic outgrowth is independent of Frizzled."
https://openalex.org/W2166742757,"It was previously shown that newly formed oligodendrocytes depend on axons for their survival, but the nature of the axon-derived survival signal(s) remained unknown. We show here that neuregulin (NRG) supports the survival of purified oligodendrocytes and aged oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) but not of young OPCs. We demonstrate that axons promote the survival of purified oligodendrocytes and that this effect is inhibited if NRG is neutralized. In the developing rat optic nerve, we provide evidence that delivery of NRG decreases both normal oligodendrocyte death and the extra oligodendrocyte death induced by nerve transection, whereas neutralization of endogenous NRG increases the normal death. These results suggest that NRG is an axon-associated survival signal for developing oligodendrocytes."

Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jensen J.B. Vande Waa J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 112: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Within the infected erythrocytes,Plasmodia species appear to enhance oxidative stress, as indicated by the generation of methemoglobin (8Atamna H. Ginsburg H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and hydroxyalkenals (9Buffinton G.D. Hunt N.H. Cowden W.B. Clark I.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Schwarzer E. Müller O. Arese P. Siems W.G. Grune T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, they are known to be sensitive to oxidant killing, as evident from the peroxide nature and pro-oxidant potential of many antimalarial drugs and impaired survival in host cells with disturbed hydroperoxide metabolism (for review see Ref. 11Flohé L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Plasmodial enzymes involved in the antioxidant defense of the parasite have therefore attracted attention as potential targets for the development of novel antimalarials. In this context the putative plasmodial GPx gene appeared particularly intriguing. Encoding a sulfur homologue of the mammalian selenoproteins, the gene product should be substantially less efficient than the host cell enzymes. (12Rocher C. Lalanne J. Chaudiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Maiorino M. Aumann K-D. Brigelius-Flohé R. Doria D. van den Heuvel J. McCarthy J. Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The comparatively high sensitivity of Plasmodia species to hydroperoxides could therefore result from the necessity to rely on sulfur-catalyzed hydroperoxide reduction, whereas the host cells make use of the more efficient selenium catalysis. Beyond, the amino acid sequence deduced from the plasmodial GPx gene resembles phospholipid hydroperoxide peroxidase (PHGPx, GPx-4), which displays a degenerate substrate specificity (14Ursini F. Maiorino M. Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.D. Roveri A. Schomburg D. Flohé L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 38-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, it could not be taken for granted that the plasmodial GPx homologue is indeed a glutathione peroxidase. The plasmodial GPx gene was therefore heterologously expressed inEscherichia coli, and the protein was purified in sufficient quantities to allow an in-depth functional analysis. As expected, it proved to be a peroxidase acting on a broad spectrum of hydroperoxides with low efficiency. Also, the reaction rates with GSH were surprisingly low. Instead, thioredoxins reduced the enzyme efficiently enough to reclassify this member of the glutathione peroxidase family as a thioredoxin peroxidase and to substitute the acronym PfTPx for the originally introduced glutathione peroxidase of P. falciparum (PfGPx) (2Gamain B. Langsley G. Fourmaux M.N. Touzel J.P. Camus D. Dive D. Slomianny C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA encoding the PfTPx was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using asynchronous blood stage RNA and cloned into the pET5a vector (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) between the EcoRI and NdeI sites and transformed intoE. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The clone was grown in carbenicillin (1 mg/ml)-supplemented LB media at 37 °C and 180 rpm to an A 600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The culture was grown for an additional 5 h and controlled for expression by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For routine preparation, cells were harvested 3 h after induction, resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.5 (buffer A), disrupted with a French press at the 900 p.s.i., and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded on a Macro-Prep® High Q Support fitted on a Macro-Prep® High S Support column with a flow rate of 2 ml/min (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A. The Macro Prep® High S Support column alone was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0–2 m) in the same buffer. Fractions with GPx activity were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Omega Cell, cut-off 10 kDa, Pall Gelman Sciences, An Arbor, MI), loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gel filtration column equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Active fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for homogeneity and stored at 4 °C. The molecular mass of denatured PfTPx was estimated by silver-stained (15Butcher L.A. Tomkins J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 148: 348-388Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Phast SystemTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an acrylamide gradient of 8–25% and a 10-kDa ladder as reference. The molecular mass of native PfTPx was estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex S-100 column equilibrated with a 0.1 m Tris buffer of pH 7.6 containing 5 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Chymotrypsinogen, bovine serum albumin, blue dextran, and cytochromec were co-chromatographed as reference proteins. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with the reagent from Bio-Rad, taking bovine serum albumin as the standard. The precise molecular weight was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with a Bruker Reflex II-MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen-Analytik, Bremen, Germany). For this purpose the protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with the acetone, and resuspended in saturated matrix solution (10 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The protein at a final concentration about 50 pmol/μl matrix solution was accelerated at 20 kV. Spectra were externally calibrated using bovine serum albumin as standard. Approximately 200 shots were summed for each spectrum. N-terminal sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems 494 A sequencer. GPx activity was measured by monitoring the glutathione reductase-catalyzed NADPH oxidation at 340 nm at 30 °C in 0.5 ml containing 0.3 mmNADPH in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton, 5 mmEDTA, 3.3 mm GSH, and 73 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bOOH) (17Flohé L. Miquel J. Quintanilha A.T. Weber H. CRC Handbook of Free Radicals and Antioxidants in Biomedicine. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 281-286Google Scholar). Specificity for the hydroperoxide substrate was investigated with t-bOOH (Merck), cumene hydroperoxide (Merck Eurolab, Darmstad, Germany), H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide prepared according to Maiorino et al. (18Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Ursini F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The concentration of hydroperoxides was determined by allowing the GPx reaction to run to completion. For quantification of t-bOOH, H2O2, and cumene hydroperoxide bovine GPx (Sigma-Aldrich), for phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide a PHGPx preparation of rat testis (19Maiorino M. Wissing J.B. Brigelius-Flohé R. Calabrese F. Roveri A. Steinert P. Ursini F. Flohé L. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was used. Thioredoxin peroxidase activity was determined analogously by replacing GSH by thioredoxin and glutathione reductase by thioredoxin reductase. In each case the particular thioredoxin was coupled to the thioredoxin reductase of the same species. Care was taken that the thioredoxin reductase capacity never became rate-limiting. E. colithioredoxin was from Sigma-Aldrich, human thioredoxin was kindly provided by Prof. A. Holmgren Uppsala, Sweden, and thioredoxin as well as thioredoxin reductase of P. falciparum were prepared as described elsewhere (20Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1996; 80: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, the glutathione peroxidase assay was performed at GSH concentrations ranging from 3.3 to 30 mm and various hydroperoxides (t-bOOH, H2O2, cumene hydroperoxides). Thioredoxin peroxidase kinetics were performed with thioredoxin of P. falciparum at concentrations between 1.5 and 5 μm. Spontaneous reaction rates were subtracted. Kinetic data were obtained by the single curve progression analysis according to Forstrom et al. (22Forstrom J.W. Stults F.H. Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and further analyzed as described by Dalziel (23Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar) for bisubstrate reactions. E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLys cells transformed with the pET5a-derived expression plasmid efficiently produced PfTPx upon induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, as indicated by the appearance of a prominent band of ∼20 kDa. The heterologously expressed protein peaked near 2 h after induction and appeared to remain stable for at least three more hours. The purification scheme applied yielded a product of apparent electrophoretic homogeneity (Fig.1). The apparent as well the precise molecular mass of 19,750 Da obtained by MALDI-TOF spectrometry was significantly less than the molecular mass of 23953 Da calculated for the deduced amino acid sequence of full-length PfTPx (205 residues). N-terminal sequencing revealed an amino acid sequence covering position 26–40 of the deduced PfTPx sequence shown in Fig.2. Within experimental error, the experimentally determined molecular mass complies with that calculated for a sequence covering position 26 to 196 (19,780.8 Da).Figure 2Alignment of PfTPx with four distinct types of human glutathione peroxidases: PHGPx (Swiss-Prot accession number),extracellular GPx ( pGPx ; Swiss-Prot accession number ),gastrointestinal GPx (giGPx; Swiss-Prot accession number ), and cGPx (Swiss-Prot accession number ).Amino acid residues of PfTPx conserved in other GPx types are shadowed.

Also the PfTPx sequence as obtained by heterologous expression in E. coli, corresponds to the homologous stretch of 170 amino acid residues found in mature porcine PHGPx (24Brigelius-Flohé R. Aumann K.-D. Blöcker H. Gross G. Kiess M. Kloeppel K.- D. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Schuckelt R. Ursini F. Wingender E. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 10: 7342-7348Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Like PHGPx, PfTPx proved to be monomeric when subjected to Sephadex G-100 gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions. The nativity of the eluting enzyme was verified by GPx activity measurements. It eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 18.9 kDa, whereas no activity could be detected in the fractions corresponding to the molecular mass of its tetrameric congeners, pGPx or cGPx. As is evident from the x-ray structures of cGPx (25Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and pGPx (26Ren B. Huang W. Akesson B. Ladenstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 869-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), subunit contact surfaces in these tetrameric GPx types are essentially built up by residues corresponding to the inserts at positions 121 and 161 of the PfTPx sequence (27Flohé L. Aumann K-D. Brigelius-Flohé R. Schomburg D. Strassburger W. Ursini F. Yagi K. Active Oxygens, Lipid Peroxides, and Antioxidants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 291-311Google Scholar). They are missing in both PfTPx and PHGPx, which explains their monomeric nature. PfTPx, like PHGPx, was more active with cumene hydroperoxide, less active with H2O2 and t-bOOH, and unlike PHGPx, did not at all accept phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide (data not shown). In terms of molar efficiencies, PfTPx appeared markedly poorer than bovine cGPx coinvestigated as a selenoperoxidase reference standard. Specific GPx activities, as measured under routine conditions, differed by three orders of magnitude (not shown). The kinetic mechanism for GSH-dependent hydroperoxide reduction by PfTPx was evaluated by means of the single curve progression analysis (22Forstrom J.W. Stults F.H. Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at various fixed GSH concentrations, which were kept constant over time by regeneration, and a suboptimal concentration of ROOH, which declined over time and correspondingly lead to slowing down of the reaction rate. From these curves, the reciprocal concentrations of ROOH at intervals of 2 s were derived and plotted against the initial velocities at each pertinent time point, as exemplified for the turnover of t-bOOH by GSH in Fig.3. The data are presented as Dalziel plots (23Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 1706-1723Crossref Google Scholar), in which the reciprocal velocities are multiplied by enzyme molarities to facilitate the extrapolation of meaningful kinetic coefficients, as indicated. As shown in Fig. 3, such primary plots yielded parallel slopes for different concentrations of GSH, as is typical for “enzyme substitution” or “ping-pong” mechanisms. Replotting the reciprocal GSH concentrations against the reciprocal apparent V max for infinite concentrations of t-bOOH yielded a straight line cutting at the ordinate origin (Fig.4). The same kinetic pattern was displayed by PfTPx with H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide as long as GSH was used as reducing substrate (TableI). It can be described by a Dalziel equation for two substrate ping-pong mechanisms. [E0]V=Φ0+Φ1[ROOH]+Φ2[GSH]Equation 1 wherein the coefficient Φ0 approximates zero. Accordingly, limiting V max andK m values are infinite. Such lack of enzyme saturation can be due to two distinct catalytic phenomena, either the formation of enzyme-substrate complex is slower than the reaction within the complexes or specific enzyme-substrate complexes not formed at all, as is presumed in Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4. Ered+ROOH⇄k−1k+1Eox+ROHEquation 2 Eox+GSH⇄k−2k+2E−SG+H2OEquation 3 E−SG+GSH⇄k−3k+3Ered+GSSGEquation 4 In this case, the coefficient Φ1 is defined as the reciprocal rate constant k +1′ for the net forward reaction of reduced enzyme with ROOH and depends on the nature of the peroxide (Table I). k 1+′ is defined as k +1 − k −1, and may be regarded as k +1, since the partial reaction shown in Equation 2 should be irreversible. Φ2is the reciprocal k +2′for the two-step regeneration of the reduced enzyme by GSH according to Equations 3 and4. Therefore, the physical meaning of k +2′is more complex (Equation 5). k+2′=k+2−k−2+k+3−k−3Equation 5 The kinetic pattern of PfTPx is identical to that of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases (28Flohé L.

Instead, they are similar to those of a sulfur homologue of PHGPx produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Although Φ1 for authentic porcine PHGPx is 0.07 μm s, and Φ2 is 8.3 μm s, the cysteine-containing PHGPx mutein, with a Φ1 of 20 and Φ2 of 40,000 μm s (13Maiorino M. Aumann K-D. Brigelius-Flohé R.

The reciprocal apparent maximum velocities (n = 3 each) extrapolated for infinite concentration of t-bOOH, are plotted against the reciprocal GSH concentrations. The slope yields Φ2. Cutting the ordinate at zero indicates that the term Φ0approaches zero, which implies that the maximum velocity andK m values of PfTPx are infinite for the pair of substrates investigated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic coefficients and apparent rate constants of PfTPx for the reduction of different hydroperoxides by GSHEnzymeSubstrate ROOHΦ0Φ1k 1′Φ2k 2′sμmsm−1 s−1μmsm−1 s−1PfTPxt-bOOH0327.8 ± 24.73.3 × 10343,100 ± 904623PfTPxCumeneOOH≈0 (0.8)50.0 ± 23.12.0 × 10445,539 ± 258922PfTPxH2O20398.6 ± 14.22.5 × 10352,600 ± 378619PHGPxPCOOH00.071.4 × 1078.41.2 × 105PHGPx Sec → CysPCOOH020.05.0 × 10440,00025The Dalziel coefficients Φ1 and Φ2 of PfTPx are calculated from three different sets of experiments.

In view of the low efficiency of PfTPx in GSH-dependent hydroperoxide reduction and the sequence similarities to the less GSH-specific pGPx (32Björnstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J.

TableII shows that PfTPx indeed accepts thioredoxins of various species. The turnover rates observed with thioredoxin of E. coli and man in the submillimolar range were similar to those measured with 10 mm GSH, and autologous plasmodial thioredoxin at a concentration of only 5 μm triggered a significantly faster reaction.Table IISpecificity of PfTPx for thioredoxinsDonor substrateSpecific rateμmol of t-bOOH min−1 mg−1PfTrx (5.0 μm)0.47Human Trx (200 μm)0.12E. coli Trx (85 μm)0.16GSH (10 mm)0.10GSH as reducing substrate was replaced by Trx of E. coli (85 μm), human (200 μm), and P. falciparum (5 μm), and glutathione reductase as indicator enzyme (5.6 units/ml) was replaced by the autologous thioredoxin reductases (0.5 unit/ml, 0.56 unit/ml, 0.001 unit/ml, respectively).

Open table in a new tab GSH as reducing substrate was replaced by Trx of E. coli (85 μm), human (200 μm), and P. falciparum (5 μm), and glutathione reductase as indicator enzyme (5.6 units/ml) was replaced by the autologous thioredoxin reductases (0.5 unit/ml, 0.56 unit/ml, 0.001 unit/ml, respectively). With each of the thioredoxins, the specific rate was at least as high as that observed with GSH at 50–2000× the concentration. Based on these preliminary findings, the kinetics of PfTPx were analyzed with thioredoxin (Trx) of P. falciparum (PfTrx) and t-bOOH. Fig. 5 reveals that also with PfTrx a ping-pong pattern is observed. The secondary plot (Fig.6), however, shows a marked difference when compared with the kinetic pattern obtained with GSH as reducing substrate. The slope no longer cuts the ordinate at zero, implying Michaelis-Menten-type saturation kinetics with defined Φ2, V max, andK m values. Also, the Φ2 value for PfTrx is much lower than for GSH (Table III). This kinetic pattern and the coefficients obtained allow the following conclusions. (i) The reducing substrate does not affect the reaction of the reduced enzyme with the hydroperoxide (Equation 2); Φ1 ork 1, respectively, are not significantly different for the GSH- and the PfTrx-driven reaction, as expected for a ping-pong mechanism. (ii) Saturation kinetics therefore can only result from a shift of rate constants in the reductive part of catalytic cycle. Obviously, the formation of a complex between the oxidized enzyme and PfTrx occurs faster with k +4 −k −4 than its decay withk +5 (Equation 6).

It approximates the dissociation constant K s =k −4/k +4 and can be taken as a measure of affinity for PfTrx. (iv) The overall rate determiningk cat, then, is k +5. (v) The high k +2′value and saturation kinetics with a low K m classify PfTrx as a specific substrate of PfTPx.Figure 6Secondary Dalziel plot of the PfTPx-catalyzed reduction of t-bOOH by PfTrx.

https://openalex.org/W2017532159,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a multisited and multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Upon ligand binding, the monomeric receptor undergoes dimerization resulting in kinase activation. The consequences of kinase stimulation are the phosphorylation of its own tyrosine residues (autophosphorylation) followed by association with and activation of signal transducers. Deregulation of signaling resulting from aberrant expression of the EGFR has been implicated in a number of neoplasms including breast, brain, and skin tumors. A mutant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor missing 267 amino acids from the exoplasmic domain is common in human glioblastomas. The truncated receptor (EGFRvIII/ΔEGFR) lacks EGF binding activity; however, the kinase is constitutively active, and cells expressing the receptor are tumorigenic. Our studies revealed that the high kinase activity of the ΔEGFR is due to self-dimerization, and contrary to earlier reports, the kinase activity per molecule of the dimeric ΔEGFR is comparable to that of the EGF-stimulated wild-type receptor. Furthermore, the phosphorylation patterns of both receptors are similar as determined by interaction with a conformation-specific antibody and by phosphopeptide analysis. This eliminates the possibility that the defective down-regulation of the ΔEGFR is due to its altered phosphorylation pattern as has been suggested previously. Interestingly, the receptor-receptor self-association is highly dependent on a conformation induced by N-linked glycosylation. We have identified four potential sites that might participate in self-dimerization; these sites are located in a domain that plays an important role in EGFR functioning.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation patterns of both receptors are similar as determined by interaction with a conformation-specific antibody and by phosphopeptide analysis. This eliminates the possibility that the defective down-regulation of the ΔEGFR is due to its altered phosphorylation pattern as has been suggested previously. Interestingly, the receptor-receptor self-association is highly dependent on a conformation induced by N-linked glycosylation. We have identified four potential sites that might participate in self-dimerization; these sites are located in a domain that plays an important role in EGFR functioning. epidermal growth factor receptor antibody bovine serum albumin 3,3′-bis(sulfosuccinimido)suberate epidermal growth factor high pressure liquid chromatography monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wheat germ agglutinin wild-type EGFR amino acid The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a cysteine-rich extracellular region and an intracellular domain containing uninterrupted kinase site and multiple autophosphorylation sites clustered at the C-terminal tail (see Ref. 1Ullrich A.

Domains I (amino acids 1–165) and III (aa 310–481) have 37% sequence identity, whereas domains II (aa 166–309) and IV (aa 482–621) are rich in cysteines (3Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engleman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). These cysteines are linked by intra-chain disulfide bonding (4Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Domain III has been shown to bind directly with EGF, and then two molecules of the monomeric receptor-ligand complex interact to form a dimeric complex. Domain I is believed to be involved in the second interaction (3Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engleman D.M. Schlessinger J.

The earliest consequence of kinase activation is the phosphorylation of its own tyrosine residues (autophosphorylation), and this is followed by its association with and activation/phosphorylation of signal transducers leading to mitogenesis. In addition, we have demonstrated a phosphorylation-induced conformational alteration of the EGFR (5Panneerselvam K. Reitz H. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7975-7979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such conformational change agrees well with the finding that autophosphorylation also results in unmasking of cryptic cytoplasmic domain(s) needed for receptor internalization (6Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 265-284Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar).Deregulation of signaling due to the aberrant expression of the EGFR has been implicated in oncogenesis. Nearly 50% of grade IV gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme) have amplified EGFR genes. In the majority of such cases, the EGFR gene amplification is correlated with structural rearrangement of the gene, resulting in in-frame deletions that preserve the reading frame of the receptor message. To date, three truncated forms of EGFR have been identified (7Wong A.J. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Grzeschik C.H. Humphrey P.A. Bigner D.S. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The type III deletion mutant occurs in 17% of the glioblastomas and is characterized by an 801-base pair in-frame deletion resulting in the removal of N-terminal amino acid residues 6–273 from the extracellular domain of the intact 170-kDa EGFR (9Sugawa N.

Although there is a consensus that this truncated receptor (EGFRvIII/ΔEGFR) lacks ligand binding activity and the kinase is constitutively active (10Ekstrand A.J. Liu L. He J. Hamid M.L. Longo N. Collins V.P. James A.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1455-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J.

A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), the subcellular localization of the receptor has not yet been conclusively established. In some transfectants, a significant fraction of the receptor population was reported to be intracellular (10Ekstrand A.J. Liu L. He J. Hamid M.L. Longo N. Collins V.P. James A.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1455-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar), whereas studies from another laboratory appear to suggest that the receptors are predominantly on the cell surface (12Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular mechanism by which the transfectants acquire transforming activity is not clear. Studies from Cavenee and co-workers (13Prigent S.A. Nagane M. Lin H. Huvar I. Boss G.R. Feramisco J.R. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25639-25645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) suggest that constitutive activation of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway contributes to the transforming activity of the ΔEGFR, and the studies from Wong and co-workers (14Moscatello D.K. Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Montgomery R.B. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 200-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Antonyk M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the transformation is mediated through constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and not through Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.Although the ΔEGFR undergoes ligand-independent kinase activation, the extent of autophosphorylation of the ΔEGFR is significantly less compared with that of the ligand-stimulated WtEGFR (11Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C- M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation-induced conformational change results in exposure of sequence motifs involved in endocytic and lysosomal sorting and such unmasking is thought to be obligatory for receptor down-regulation (6Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 265-284Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), this may explain the persistent presence of the ΔEGFR on the cell surface. It is possible that the endocytic codes are cryptic in the receptors that are in partially active conformation. However, it is an open question why the ΔEGFRs are not fully active although the receptor is capable of self-dimerization. Is it due to the fact that receptor dimerization is necessary but not sufficient for full kinase activity? It is also not known why the ΔEGFR undergoes self-association, whereas the WtEGFR does not. Such information will be useful in developing strategies to control the activity of the aberrant receptor.Contrary to earlier reports, our studies reported here suggest that there is no difference between the dimeric ΔEGFR and the ligand-stimulated WtEGFR with respect to kinase activity as determined by the extent of autophosphorylation. We also demonstrate by using a conformation-specific antibody that detects an epitope exposed only upon phosphorylation of tyrosines 992, 1068, and 1086 (17Bishayee A. Beguinot L. Bishayee S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) that the antibody recognizes the ΔEGFR as fully active receptor. This is further confirmed by phosphopeptide analysis. This suggests that in addition to its persistent presence on the cell surface, the high kinase activity of the ΔEGFR also contributes to its tumorigenic activity. Finally, we report that the ligand-independent dimerization of the ΔEGFR is contingent upon core glycosylation. Out of 12 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the receptor, the four sites located in domain III are likely to be involved in inducing a stable conformation needed for receptor-receptor association. Based on these and related studies, we also propose models for self- and ligand-induced receptor dimerization and how subdomains within the extracellular region might influence such interactions.RESULTSMutation of the EGFR resulting in type III truncation occurs spontaneously in vivo in glioma cells. This led us to use a human glioma cell line, U87MG, as the host for the expression of the ΔEGFR/EGFRvIII and, as a control, the wild-type receptor. The ΔEGFR maintains its transforming activity in this host cell. Another advantage in selecting this cell line is that it is deficient in endogenous EGFR (see below).Receptor Numbers per Cell in U87MG.ΔEGFREarlier reports suggested that the ΔEGFR lacks ligand binding activity (10Ekstrand A.J. Liu L. He J. Hamid M.L. Longo N. Collins V.P. James A.D. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1455-1460PubMed Google Scholar, 11Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Hence we used 125I-labeled mAb 425 antibody to determine the number of receptor molecules per cell with an objective to investigate whether both receptor types are expressed in comparable numbers. Such studies should also allow us to determine the endogenous receptor level in U87MG.ΔEGFR cells. This information is also important for the studies described in this paper. mAb 425 is a monoclonal antibody directed to a peptide epitope in the extracellular domain of the EGFR, and it binds to the receptor with very high affinity (19Murthy U. Basu A. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Das M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 25: 549-560Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier studies have demonstrated the specific and saturable binding of this antibody to membranes from a human carcinoma cell line, A431(19). Thus, mAb 425 is suitable for determining the receptor numbers under circumstances where EGF cannot be used. The concentration of the antibody used for receptor assay (215 ng/ml) leads to maximum binding to both U87MG.ΔEGFR and U87MG.WtEGFR cells since there was no further increase in the specific binding of the antibody to either cell type when mAb 425 concentration was increased by 3-fold (data not shown). Different laboratories including ours have reported the use of saturating concentration of a ligand for the estimation of receptor numbers (17Bishayee A. Beguinot L. Bishayee S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Sorkin A. Helin K. Waters C.M. Carpenter G. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the antibody binding, U87MG.ΔEGFR cells express 4.4 × 105receptors per cell (see Table I). To investigate whether the estimated numbers of antibody-binding sites reflect the actual receptor sites, we also determined the receptor numbers in U87MG.WtEGFR using 125I-EGF binding and compared it with the antibody-binding sites. As shown in Table I, the receptor sites calculated based on ligand binding (5.1 × 105) were similar to the receptor numbers determined by antibody binding (5.3 × 105) indicating the validity of this method. This suggests that (i) the expression levels of both the receptors are comparable (4.4 × 105 receptor sites/cell for ΔEGFRversus ∼5 × 105 receptor sites/cell for WtEGFR) and (ii) the bulky size of the antibody of molecular mass 150-kDa relative to EGF of 6-kDa did not adversely influence its binding to the receptor. We also determined the endogenous EGFRs in U87MG.ΔEGFR by 125I-EGF binding (0.2 × 105 sites/cell), and it represents less than 5% of the truncated receptor population. This is further confirmed by Western blot analysis followed by densitometric scanning of the 170-kDa wild-type receptor band and the 145–150-kDa truncated receptor band (Fig. 2).Figure 2Western blot analysis to quantify endogenous EGFR in U87MG.Δ EGFR. Plasma membranes from U87MG.ΔEGFR were subjected to Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti-170-kDa antibody directed to denatured human EGFR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by ECL Plus reagents. The receptor bands are marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Isolation of the Dimeric ΔEGFR in Biologically Active State and Its Kinase ActivityBased on chemical cross-linking studies in which intact cells were reacted with a cross-linker, it was concluded that the autokinase activity of the ΔEGFR is 20% that of the EGF-stimulated wild-type receptor (11Moscatello D.K. Montgomery R.B. Sundareshan P. McDanel H. Wong M.Y. Wong A.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 85-96PubMed Google Scholar, 16Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Huang C- M. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. Cavenee W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2927-2935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Since the ΔEGFR is capable of self-dimerization, it implies that receptor dimerization is obligatory but not sufficient for full kinase activation. Hence to examine the extent of dimerization and more importantly to investigate the kinase activity of the dimeric receptor, sedimentation studies were performed to isolate the monomeric and dimeric forms of the ΔEGFR in the biologically active state. For this purpose the WGA-agarose-purified receptors from U87MG.ΔEGFR cell membranes were subjected to sucrose sedimentation analysis, and the kinase activity of the gradient fractions was assayed by autophosphorylation. As control, the WtEGFR was also subjected to sedimentation analysis under similar conditions; however, the gradient fractions were assayed by autophosphorylation in the presence of EGF. The identity of the EGFR in the gradient fractions was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with mAb 425 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, the ΔEGFR exists in two forms, a slow moving form and a fast moving form; however, under similar conditions the WtEGFR moves as a single entity with a mobility similar to that of the slow moving component of the ΔEGFR. To determine the molecular weights of the different components, we analyzed the peak fractions by chemical cross-linking. For this purpose, the 32P-labeled receptor preparations were subjected to chemical cross-linking with 50 μmBS3, immunoprecipitated with mAb 425, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3 (insets), following BS3 treatment of the faster moving peak from the ΔEGFR, a cross-linked complex corresponding to a molecular weight of ∼300,000 could be detected; the receptor population that escaped cross-linking is present as an 145–150-kDa band. The 145–150-kDa band and not the 300-kDa band was seen when cross-linking was carried out with the slower moving peak. These suggest that the fast and the slow moving components of the ΔEGFR represent the dimeric and the monomeric forms of the receptor, respectively. No cross-linked complex could be seen when the peak fraction from the WtEGFR was subjected to BS3 treatment and the 32P-labeled receptor moved as a 170-kDa protein, a size consistent with the monomeric form of the receptor. For the experiment described in Fig. 3, the truncated receptor has undergone a series of treatments that not only took more than 10 h to complete but also resulted in significant receptor dilution. Despite these treatments, a significant portion of the ΔEGFR exists in the dimeric state.We also determined the specific activity of monomeric ΔEGFR kinase. For this purpose we quantified both the wild-type and the truncated receptors in the gradient fractions by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed to the denatured 170-kDa EGFR (see Fig.4). Both the receptors were also quantified by probing the blot with a monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope located in the C-terminal tail of the EGFR. The relative intensities of the bands are similar to that of the blot probed with the anti-170-kDa antibody. This strengthens the possibility that the wild-type and truncated receptors react equally well in Western blot with anti-170-kDa antibody as well as with the C-terminal antibody, and hence the Western blot result reflects the actual amount of these two proteins in the gradient fractions. As shown in Fig. 4, the kinase activity per unit receptor protein for the dimeric receptor is 5–7-fold higher relative to the monomeric receptor. Furthermore, the extent of autophosphorylation per molecule of the dimeric ΔEGFR (fractions 15–18) is similar to that of the ligand-activated WtEGFR (fractions 19–22) (see Fig. 4). This suggests that receptor dimerization, at least with respect to the ΔEGFR, is sufficient for full kinase activation.Figure 4Quantification of kinase activity per unit of protein. Protein in the gradient fractions in Fig. 3 was quantified by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody directed to denatured human EGFR, and the immune complexes were visualized by125I-protein A. The relative intensities of the bands were the same when the blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody directed to an epitope in the C-terminal tail of the receptor. Plots of autokinase activity determined either in the absence (for ΔEGFR) or presence (for WtEGFR) of EGF in the gradient fractions per unit of protein are shown. The positions of the monomeric and dimeric receptor are marked by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interaction of the ΔEGFR with an Antibody That Recognizes Only the Activated ReceptorThe studies described above revealed that there is no difference with respect to kinase activity between the ΔEGFR which undergoes dimerization in the absence of the ligand and the EGF-stimulated wild-type receptor. This led us to investigate whether the phosphorylation pattern and phosphorylation-mediated conformational change of the receptors are also similar. Such information is important since it has been proposed that the slow endocytic rate of the ΔEGFR is due to its altered phosphorylation (16Huang H.-J.S. Nagane M. Klingbeil C.K. Lin H. Nishikawa R.

For this purpose we studied the interaction of a conformation-specific antibody, Ab P2, with the ΔEGFR and compared it with that of the WtEGFR. This anti-peptide antibody Ab P2 recognizes the phosphorylated and hence activated EGFR and not the unphosphorylated receptor; however, Ab P2 is not directed to phosphotyrosine (5Panneerselvam K. Reitz H. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7975-7979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Scher C.D. Khan S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The receptor conformation recognized by the antibody is positively regulated by phosphorylation of three tyrosine residues at 992, 1068, and 1086. The phosphorylation of the other two acceptor sites, namely tyrosines 1148 and 1173, does not play any role in antibody binding (17Bishayee A. Beguinot L. Bishayee S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Bishayee A. Beguinot L. Bishayee S. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It should be mentioned in this context that the interaction between Ab P2 and the activated receptor is independent of EGF (5Panneerselvam K. Reitz H. Khan S.A. Bishayee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7975-7979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To study the interaction between Ab P2 and the EGFR, the detergent-solubilized membranes from the wild-type receptor stimulated by EGF and the truncated receptor (both expressed in U87MG cells) were phosphorylated by labeled ATP, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors were isolated by 1G2-Sepharose. Equal amounts of the receptors were then subjected to immunoprecipitation by Ab P2, and the receptor bands following SDS-PAGE were quantified by densitometric scanning. The extent of precipitation of the ΔEGFR at each of the antibody concentrations was similar to that of the WtEGFR at the corresponding antibody concentration (Fig.5). This indicates that the affinity of the antibody for both receptor types is similar and the phosphorylation pattern, at least with respect to Tyr 992, 1068, and 1086, of the ΔEGFR is comparable to that of the WtEGFR. This is further confirmed by phosphopeptide analysis of the receptors. The HPLC elution profiles of the phosphopeptides from the ΔEGFR were similar to that of the WtEGFR (Fig. 6). This suggests that the inefficient internalization of the ΔEGFR is not due to its altered phosphorylation.Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of the WtEGFR and Δ EGFR by a conformation-specific antibody, Ab P2. 1.25 pmol of 1G2-purified 32P-labeled WtEGFR and ΔEGFR (quantified according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures”) were immunoprecipitated by indicated amounts of Ab P2 and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography (A).

Nature. 1984; 309: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Earlier studies have demonstrated the importance of core glycosylation in EGF binding and hence for kinase activation (29Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

Since four of the 12 sites are missing from the ΔEGFR and it lacks ligand binding activity, we investigated whether the conformation of the truncated receptor is influenced by glycosylation and if so whether such conformational modification plays any role in kinase activation. Like the aglyco-WtEGFR which does not interact with mAb 425 (19Murthy U. Basu A. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Das M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 25: 549-560Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), aglyco-ΔEGFR synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin is also not capable of binding with the antibody (data not shown). As discussed above (see Table I), this monoclonal antibody is directed to an extracellular peptide epitope of the EGFR (19Murthy U. Basu A. Rodeck U. Herlyn M. Ross A.H. Das M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 25: 549-560Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and it also recognizes the ΔEGFR. This suggests that the aglyco-ΔEGFR, like the aglyco-WtEGFR, fails to attain certain conformation needed for mAb 425 binding. We also investigated if there is any relationship between the conformational alteration induced by glycosylation and kinase activation of the ΔEGFR. Cells expressing the ΔEGFR were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in the absence or presence of tunicamycin, and then the labeled receptors were quantified by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody coupled to agarose.

One of the most prominent proteins within CD81 and CD9 complexes is identified here as FPRP, the 133-kDa prostaglandin F2α receptor regulatory protein. FPRP, a cell-surface Ig superfamily protein, associates specifically with CD81 or with CD81 and CD9, but not with integrins or other TM4SF proteins. In contrast to other CD81- and CD9-associating proteins, FPRP associates at very high stoichiometry, with essentially 100% of cell-surface FPRP on 293 cells being CD81- and CD9-associated. Also, CD81·CD9·FPRP complexes have a discrete size (<4 × 106 Da) as measured by gel permeation chromatography and remain intact after disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Although CD81 associated with both α3 integrin and FPRP in 293 cells, the α3β1·CD81 and CD81·CD9·FPRP complexes were distinct, as determined by immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments. In conclusion, our data affirm the existence of distinct TM4SF complexes with unique compositions and specifically characterize FPRP as the most robust, highly stoichiometric CD81- and/or CD9-associated protein yet described.

In contrast to other CD81- and CD9-associating proteins, FPRP associates at very high stoichiometry, with essentially 100% of cell-surface FPRP on 293 cells being CD81- and CD9-associated. Also, CD81·CD9·FPRP complexes have a discrete size (<4 × 106 Da) as measured by gel permeation chromatography and remain intact after disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Although CD81 associated with both α3 integrin and FPRP in 293 cells, the α3β1·CD81 and CD81·CD9·FPRP complexes were distinct, as determined by immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments. In conclusion, our data affirm the existence of distinct TM4SF complexes with unique compositions and specifically characterize FPRP as the most robust, highly stoichiometric CD81- and/or CD9-associated protein yet described. transmembrane-4 superfamily 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis high pressure liquid chromatography methyl-β-cyclodextrin prostaglandin F2α receptor regulatory protein CD81, a member of the transmembrane-4 superfamily (TM4SF),1 also called tetraspanins, was first identified as the target of an antibody that inhibited proliferation of a B lymphoma cell line (1Oren R.

As TM4SF proteins, CD81 and CD9 possess short cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini and a short cytoplasmic loop, all of which lack any obvious signaling motifs (19Wright M.D. Tomlinson M.G.

Instead of signaling directly, TM4SF proteins may act as facilitators or adaptors (20Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S.

Associations between CD81 or CD9 and other molecules may be functionally meaningful. For example, antibodies to CD19 and CD81 both trigger homotypic aggregation (23Bradbury L.E. Kansas G.S. Levy S. Evans R.L. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2841-2850PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a CD19 chimera that no longer associates with CD81 no longer mediates this effect (31Matsumoto A.K. Martin D.R. Carter R.H. Klickstein L.B. Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Also, B cells from CD81-null mice have reduced levels of cell-surface CD19 and impaired calcium fluxes in response to CD19 cross-linking (8Maecker H.T. Levy S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Tsitsikov E.N. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other studies have shown that anti-CD81 antibodies may both stimulate (32Behr S. Schriever F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and interfere with (6Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yanez-Mo M. Alfranca A. Cabanas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Domanico S.Z. Pelletier A.J. Havran W.L. Quaranta V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) the functions of the CD81-associated integrins, and ectopic expression of CD9 may modulate integrin signaling (35Berditchevski F. Odintsova E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the structural basis of the proposed TM4SF network. The large number of putative CD81- and CD9-associated proteins raises questions about the size of these complexes and the proximity and specificity of individual associations. In this regard, gel permeation analysis of TM4SF complexes in CHAPS lysates suggests that these complexes could be in excess of 20 × 106Da (36Skubitz K.M. Campbell K.D. Skubitz A.P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, isopycnic sucrose gradient results suggest that many TM4SF associations may exist in the context of large detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (37Shevchenko A. Keller P. Scheiffele P. Mann M. Simons K. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2591-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Yashiro-Ohtani Y. Zhou X.Y. Toyo-Oka K. Tai X.G. Park C.S. Hamaoka T. Abe R. Miyake K. Fujiwara H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a large number of CD81 and CD9 associations are seen in relatively mild (i.e. permissive) detergents such as CHAPS, Tween 20, Brij 58, and Brij 99 (22, 39, 40) that are generally less able to disrupt microdomain-containing vesicles in cell lysates. The tendency of TM4SF proteins to associate with each other raises critical issues regarding specificity. For example, in CHAPS extracts of Raji cells, anti-CD37, anti-CD53, anti-CD82, and anti-CD81 antibodies all coprecipitated several major bands of identical molecular mass (27Angelisova P. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). When transfected into Raji cells, CD9 acquired a pattern of coprecipitating bands that was very similar to that of CD81 and CD82 (22Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudriere-Gesbert C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). CD9 and CD63 immunoprecipitations from CHAPS extracts of MV3 and MEL-FC cells appeared very similar (41Radford K.J. Thorne R.F. Hersey P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and CD53, CD63, CD81, and CD82 precipitated from Brij 58 extracts of Molt-4 cells all yielded similar patterns of coprecipitating proteins, one of which was identified as α4β1 integrin (30Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Kraeft S.K. Chen L.B. Hemler M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2039-2047PubMed Google Scholar). Resolution of TM4SF specificity and proximity issues may be facilitated by careful choice of detergent lysis conditions. Detergents such as CHAPS, Tween 20, Brij 58, and Brij 99 may be of limited utility because they yield perhaps too many TM4SF-associated proteins. On the other hand, a more stringent detergent such as Triton X-100 may be too disruptive with respect to TM4SF protein associations. A useful compromise may be a moderately stringent detergent such as Brij 96/97, which yields a restricted set of CD81 and CD9 associations. For example in 1% Brij 96, associations with α3β1 and α6β1 integrins are preserved, whereas other integrin associations (seen in CHAPS, Tween 20, Brij 58, and Brij 99) are lost (29Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 42Berditchevski F. Bazzoni G. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17784-17790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Associations seen in Brij 96 have so far proven to be functionally relevant. For example, α3β1·CD81 complexes contribute to neurite outgrowth (6Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and CD81·CD19 complexes modulate B cell signaling (43Levy S. Todd S.C. Maecker H.T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Proteins so far shown to associate with CD81 or CD9 in Brij 96/97 conditions have not shown a very high stoichiometry. For example, in B cells, <10% of CD19 associated with CD81 and CD9 (44Horvath G. Serru V. Clay D. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30537-30543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and only 1–2% of CD4 associated with CD81 (45Imai T. Kakizaki M. Nishimura M. Yoshie O. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1229-1239PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, only a low level of α3β1 integrin (10–20%) associated with CD81 or CD9 in various cell lines (29Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). 2C. S. Stipp and M. E. Hemler, unpublished data. In addition, in Brij 96/97 conditions, major CD81-associated cell-surface proteins have been observed, but not yet characterized (e.g. see Refs. 29Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar and44Horvath G. Serru V. Clay D. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30537-30543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, our first goal here was to identify novel, prominent, CD81-associated protein(s) while using relatively stringent detergent conditions (Brij 96/97). Our second goal was to analyze novel CD81 complexes in terms of specificity, density, and estimated size. Our results point to complexes between CD81, CD9, and FPRP (the prostaglandin F2α receptor regulatory protein) that are novel, robust, highly specific, and occur as discrete biochemical entities. The FPRP molecule is a type I integral membrane protein containing six extracellular immunoglobulin domains (46Orlicky D.J. Nordeen S.K. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1996; 55: 261-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It associates with the prostaglandin F2α receptor and possibly other seven-transmembrane receptors and thereby reduces receptor ligand-binding capacity (47Orlicky D.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1996; 54: 247-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 48Orlicky D.J. Lieber J.G. Morin C.L. Evans R.M. J.

Aside from its associations with seven-transmembrane receptors, no other FPRP associations had been previously described.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, NT2 teratocarcinoma cells, and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Retinoic acid-treated NT2 cells (NT2RA cells) were obtained by treating NT2 cells with 10 μm retinoic acid for 4–5 weeks, splitting cells 1:6 into fresh flasks, and treating them for 10–14 days with mitotic inhibitors (56Pleasure S.J. Page C. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells consist of a mixed population of neuron-like and non-neuronal cell types. NT2 neuron-like cells (NT2N cells) were purified from NT2RA cells as previously described (6Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified neurons were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with B27 supplements (Life Technologies, Inc.) (57Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) on plates coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) diluted 1:30. Cells were biotinylated with 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 (HBSM) for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses with HBSM, cells were lysed by scraping into 1% Brij 96 (polyoxyethylene 10-oleyl ether; Fluka) in HBSM with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After a 1-h extraction at 4 °C with rocking, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Specific antibodies were added along with protein G-Sepharose, and immune complexes were collected overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing four times with lysis buffer, immune complexes were eluted by boiling in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). After rinsing with PBST, blots were developed with HRP-ExtrAvidin (Sigma) and diluted 1:3000 in PBST, followed by chemiluminescence. For immunoblotting, CD81-associated proteins were eluted from rinsed immune complexes with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 0.2% SDS in lysis buffer. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBST or with 2% bovine serum albumin and 2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (for FPRP blots). Blots were developed with diluted antibodies for α3 integrin (1:1000), FPRP (1:300), caveolin (1:5000), or transferrin receptor (1:1 mixture of OKT9 and HB21 neat tissue culture supernatants), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antiserum (diluted 1:4000) and chemiluminescence. ∼7 × 108 NT2RA cells were lysed in a total of 12 ml of 1% Brij 96 lysis buffer and precleared as described above. Anti-CD81 antibody JS64 was added at 5 μg/ml along with 160 μl (settled volume) of protein G-Sepharose, and CD81 complexes were collected overnight at 4 °C. After extensive rinsing with lysis buffer, CD81-associated proteins were eluted by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS in HBSM with 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min at 37 °C. Eluted proteins were collected in ∼250 μl with a microcentrifuge filter unit (Costar Corp.). Using an Amido Black dye binding assay (58Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar), we estimated that ∼36 μg of CD81-associated proteins were recovered in the eluate. The eluate was concentrated with a Microcon-10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc.) and resolved by SDS-PAGE on an 11% minigel. CD81-associated proteins were revealed by silver staining, excised, rinsed with 50% HPLC-grade acetonitrile, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Silver-stained bands were subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion (Promega). Multiple peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography directly coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a custom nanoelectrospray source. The column was packed in-house with 5 cm of C18 support into a New Objective one-piece 75-μm inner diameter column terminating in an 8.5-μm tip. Flow rate was 190 nl/min. During chromatography, the ion trap repetitively surveyed full-scan mass spectra over the range of m/z 300–1400, executing data-dependent scans on the three most abundant ions in the survey scan. These scans allowed acquisition of a high resolution (zoom) scan to determine charge state and exact mass and tandem mass spectra for peptide sequence information. Tandem mass spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30%, an isolation width of 2.5 Da, and recurring ions dynamically excluded.

Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) in HBSM (final concentration of 10 mm) or an equivalent volume of HBSM alone was added to lysates containing ∼2.4 × 107 cell equivalents, and lysates were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Lysates were then loaded in 45% sucrose (2 ml) over a 0.5-ml cushion of 50% sucrose and overlaid with layers of 40% sucrose (1 ml), 20% sucrose (1 ml), and 5% sucrose (0.5 ml) prepared in HBSM without detergent. Following centrifugation for 21 h at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman SW Ti-55 rotor at 4 °C, 14 fractions of 360 μl were collected from the tops of the gradients. The pellets were included in the final fraction of each gradient. 250 μl of each fraction were diluted with 750 μl of 1% Brij 96 in HBSM, and CD81 complexes were immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described above. Aliquots of each fraction were also analyzed by immunoblotting for FPRP, caveolin, and transferrin receptor. Cell surface-biotinylated 293 cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96 as described above. Lysate containing ∼1 × 107 cell equivalents was loaded in 5% glycerol with blue dextran and phenol red onto a 25.5 × 1.0-cm Sepharose 6B column that had been pre-equilibrated in 1% Brij 96 in HBSM at room temperature (Brij 96 solutions cloud upon prolonged storage at 4 °C). 22 fractions of ∼540 μl were collected, spanning from the leading edge of the blue dextran elution to the phenol red elution point. CD81 complexes were immunoprecipitated from each entire fraction and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. ∼4 × 107 293 cells were surface-biotinylated and lysed in 1% Brij 96 as described above. The lysate was divided into six equal portions to be immunodepleted four times with either protein G-Sepharose alone or with protein G-Sepharose plus mAb specific for CD9, CD81, CD151, α3 integrin (all at 10 μg/ml), or α6 integrin (1:20 dilution of ascites). The first three rounds of immunodepletion were for 60–90 min each; the final round was overnight at 4 °C. Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) was added, and each sample was further divided into six equal parts for immunoprecipitation with mAb specific for CD9, CD81, CD151, α3 integrin, or α6 integrin or with NeutrAvidin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) that had been coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized with HRP-ExtrAvidin (antibody-precipitated samples) or by immunoblotting for FPRP (NeutrAvidin-precipitated samples). To address the issue of TM4SF protein complex specificity, we first compared the profile of associated proteins for several TM4SF proteins in two different cell types. For these experiments, we lysed cells in 1% Brij 96 (same as Brij 97) because this detergent (e.g. in comparison with Brij 98/99, Brij 58, or CHAPS) often yields a narrower range of TM4SF-associated proteins. After cell-surface labeling with biotin, individual TM4SF complexes were immunoprecipitated from Brij 96 lysates. In retinoic acid-treated NT2 cells (NT2RA cells), the profiles of CD81- and CD9-associated proteins were virtually identical and were distinct from the profiles of other TM4SF proteins and integrins (Fig.1 A). For example, major CD9- and CD81-associated species migrating at ∼40, 45, and 70 kDa (asterisks) were much less abundant in or completely absent from other TM4SF complexes. Conversely, a major 36-kDa species present in CD82 complexes was absent from CD9 and CD81 complexes. In 293 cells, CD81 and CD9 complexes were again virtually identical to each other and contained major species at ∼52 and 70 kDa (Fig. 1 B,asterisks) that were much less abundant in or absent from other TM4SF complexes. Common to all the TM4SF complexes was the presence of species above 120 kDa that comigrated with integrins. These results provide confidence that CD81 and CD9 complexes may be substantially distinct from other TM4SF complexes and from integrin complexes. To examine more carefully the integrin-like material in CD81 complexes, we prepared Brij 96 lysates and then fractionated CD81-associated proteins on low percentage SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In NT2RA cells, CD81 immunoprecipitation yielded coprecipitation of a major cell-surface biotin-labeled protein of ∼133 kDa (Fig.2 A, lane 1). As seen by α3 immunoblotting (lane 2), the ∼133-kDa protein (lane 1) did not comigrate with the 150-kDa α3 subunit of α3β1integrin, the major CD81-associated integrin on NT2 cells (6Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a separate experiment, CD81 complexes from surface-biotinylated NT2RA cells were immunoprecipitated and dissociated with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS, and then proteins were re-immunoprecipitated with mAb to α3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) or α2 (lane 3). Again, the relatively small amount of re-precipitated α3β1(lane 2) appeared quite distinct from the 133-kDa proteinco-immunoprecipitated with CD81 (lane 1). As expected, no α2β1 integrin could be"
https://openalex.org/W2078716961,"Cysteine string proteins (CSPs) are secretory vesicle proteins bearing a ""J domain"" and a palmitoylated cysteine-rich ""string"" region that are critical for neurotransmitter release. The precise role of CSP in neurotransmission is controversial. Here, we demonstrate a novel interaction between CSP, receptor-coupled trimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins), and N-type Ca2+ channels. G. subunits interact with the J domain of CSP in an ATP-dependent manner; in contrast, Gbetagamma subunits interact with the C terminus of CSP in both the presence and absence of ATP. The interaction of CSP with both G proteins and N-type Ca2+ channels results in a tonic G protein inhibition of the channels. In view of the crucial importance of N-type Ca2+ channels in presynaptic vesicle release, our data attribute a key role to CSP in the fine tuning of neurotransmission."

Here, we compare the role of the two closely related α (Akt1) and β (Akt2) isoforms of PKB in muscle differentiation. During differentiation of C2.7 or L6D2 myoblasts, PKBβ was up-regulated whereas expression of PKBα was unaltered. Although the two isoforms were found active in both myoblasts and myotubes, cell fractionation experiments indicated that they displayed distinct subcellular localizations in differentiated cells with only PKBβ localized in the nuclei. In a transactivation assay, PKBβ (either wild-type or constitutively active) was more efficient than PKBα in activating muscle-specific gene expression. Moreover, microinjection of specific antibodies to PKBβ inhibited differentiation of muscle cells, whereas control or anti-PKBα antibodies did not. On the other hand, microinjection of the anti-PKBα antibodies caused a block in cell cycle progression in both non muscle and muscle cells, whereas anti-PKBβ antibodies had no effect. Taken together, these results show that PKBβ plays a crucial role in the commitment of myoblasts to differentiation that cannot be substituted by PKBα.

This developmental process is regulated at the transcriptional level by the basic helix-loop-helix myogenic proteins including MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4 (1Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factors (IGFI1 and IGFII) are potent activators of muscle differentiation. An autocrine production of IGFII by myoblasts has been linked to spontaneous differentiation triggered by lowering serum concentration in the culture medium (2Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Magri K.A.

Indeed, C2 myoblasts overexpressing an IGFII antisense construct fail to differentiate spontaneously and lose MyoD expression (4Montarras D. Aurade F. Johnson T. Ilan J. Gros F. Pinset C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Coolican and collaborators (5Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) showed that activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinases (PI3Ks) is essential for IGF-stimulated differentiation. Differentiation of L6E9, C2.7, Sol8, and chicken primary myoblasts was also shown to be dependent on PI3Ks activity (6Calera M.R. Pilch P.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Among downstream targets of PI3K, the serine/threonine protein kinase B/Akt (PKB) was proposed as an essential downstream component for IGF-induced differentiation (9Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Three different isoforms of PKB have been identified: PKBα (Akt1), PKBβ (Akt2), and PKBγ (Akt3). All of them are activated by growth factors in a PI3K-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Thr308 (Thr309 in PKBβ) in the activation loop and Ser473 (Ser474 in PKBβ) in the C-terminal activation domain is required for full activation of PKBα and PKBβ (reviewed in Refs. 10Meier R. Hemmings B.A. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and 11Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 15: 521-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The most studied isoform is PKBα/Akt1, generally referred to as PKB or Akt. PKBα has been implicated in several processes stimulated by IGFs such as cell survival, glucose uptake in myocytes and adipocytes, cell growth, and differentiation (reviewed in Refs. 12Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar and 13Coofer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Based on a dominant positive overexpression approach, a role for PKBα has been assigned in the PI3K-mediated differentiation of avian primary myoblasts (9Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z. Li J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), as well as in promoting cell survival when myoblasts escape from the cell cycle to differentiate (14Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several recent reports suggest that the α and β isoforms of PKB may have distinct functions in cellular regulation. In adipocytes, PKBβ is preferentially involved in insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation (15Hill M.M. Clarck S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Summers S.C Whiteman E.L. Cho H. Lipfert L. Birnbaum J. J. Biol.

Birnbaum M.J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). PKBβ appears to be functionally different from PKBα since stress activates PKBα and PKBγ, but not PKBβ (18Shaw M Cohen P Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Little is known about PKBβ and its potential role in myogenesis. Interestingly, PKBβ/Akt2 mRNA is up-regulated during myogenic differentiation and has a tissue-specific distribution in mouse embryos being preferentially expressed in brown fat and muscle tissues, suggesting a preferential role for this isoform in differentiation processes (19Altomare D.A. Lyons G.E. Mitsuuchi Y. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1997; 16: 2407-2411Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this report we have investigated a role for PKBβ in skeletal muscle differentiation. In contrast to the constant expression levels of PKBα, PKBβ protein levels were specifically increased during differentiation of mouse C2.7 or rat L6D2 myoblasts. The two isoforms were found active in both myoblasts and myotubes with a differentiation-dependent increase in PKBβ activity mirroring protein levels. Cell fractionation experiments indicated that the two isoforms differed in their subcellular distributions in differentiated cells with only PKBβ localized in the nuclei. When overexpressed in C2.7 cells, PKBβ (either wild-type or constitutively active forms) was more efficient than PKBα in enhancing transactivation of a muscle-specific gene. Finally, inactivation of PKBβ through microinjection of specific antibodies impaired differentiation of C2.7, L6D2, and human myoblasts, whereas anti-PKBα antibodies had no effect. By contrast, injection of the anti-PKBα antibodies caused a block in cell cycle progression in both nonmuscle and muscle cells, whereas anti-PKBβ antibodies had no effect. Taken together, these results show that the α and β isoforms of PKB play different roles in myogenesis. C2.7 (4Montarras D. Aurade F. Johnson T. Ilan J. Gros F. Pinset C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 551-560PubMed Google Scholar) or L6D2 myoblasts (a subclone of L6 cells; Ref. 20Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) were grown in proliferation medium (50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker, France), 50% Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). To induce muscle differentiation, myoblasts were placed in differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% fetal calf serum). Clonal human myoblasts (CHM) were obtained from needle biopsy sample taken from the paravertebral muscle of a healthy subject, using an experimental protocol previously described for rodent (21Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To obtain an homogenous population of myoblasts, cells were grown as a clonal population and individually tested for their capacity to differentiate in a low serum containing medium. Selected clones were mixed together. The population obtained called CHM (for cloned human myoblasts) can be grown for 6–10 passages. Following transfer into a differentiation medium, the majority of cells fuse into multinucleated myotubes after 36–48 h, expressing muscle-specific markers such as myogenin and troponin T. 50 μg of cellular protein extracts prepared from proliferating or differentiated C2.7 or L6D2 cells were analyzed by Western blot as previously described (21Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were rabbit anti-PKBα (22Meier R. Alessi D.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), sheep anti-PKBβ (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-myogenin (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sheep antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A/G (Interchim, France). Blots were developed by using an Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Cells (myoblasts and myotubes) were resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1% w/v Nonidet P-40, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and homogenized by passages through a 21-gauge needle. Following a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g, soluble proteins were quantified using a Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 200–400 μg of cell free extracts were pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with either rabbit anti-PKBα or sheep anti-PKBβ antibodies. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added for 30 min at 4 °C, and beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, once with lysis buffer, and once with kinase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). In vitro kinase assay were performed for 30 min at 30 °C by adding 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1,000–2,000 cpm/pmol), 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 2 μg of the Crosstide sequence (23Cross D.A.

Proteins were subsequently separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity was analyzed by autoradiography. The PKB substrate GST-GRPRTSS*FAEG (the asterisk denotes the phosphorylated serine) and the mutant substrate GST-GRPKTSSFAEG were purified from extracts of bacteria (XL1-blue) as described by the manufacturer of the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bacteria had been transformed with GST expression plasmids pGEX-6P-1/GRPRTSSFAEG or pGEX-6P-1/GRPKTSSFAEG, respectively. These plasmids were constructed by inserting oligonucleotides with the sequence GATCCGGAAGGCCAAGAACTTCATCGTTCGCAGAGGGTC (pGEX-6P-1/GRPRTSSFAEG) or GATCCGGAAGGCCAAAAACTTCATCGTTC GCAGAGGGTC (pGEX-6P-1/GRPKTSSF- AEG) into the BamHI andXhoI site of pGEX-6P-1. Cells were collected in an ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin and lysed by 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by a 10-min centrifugation at 2000 × g and rinsed once with hypotonic buffer. Protein concentrations in the cytoplasmic fraction was determined using the Bradford detection reagent (Bio-Rad). Isolated nuclei were lysed directly in a volume of 1× Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 8% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) equal to that of the cytoplasmic fraction. Plasmids used for transfection were: The pECE vector either empty or encoding wild-type PKB tagged with HA (pECE-HA-PKBαwt, pECE-HA-PKBβwt), inactive PKB (pECE-HA-PKBαkd, pECE-HA-PKBβkd), or constitutively active membrane-targeted PKB (pECE-HA-PKBαm and -βm; 22, 25), pRL-TK (Promega, Charbonnieres, France), and muscle creatine kinase enhancer and promoter upstream of firefly luciferase gene (MCK-luc; gift from S. Leibovitch, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France). Transfections were carried out using 4 μl of FuGENE and 1 μg of DNA in 35-mm dishes as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were kept in proliferation medium for 24 h and transferred to differentiation medium for indicated times before processing for Western blot or immunofluorescence as described elsewhere (21Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Antibodies to HA and myogenin were used to visualize transfected and differentiated cells, respectively. For luciferase assay, cells were transfected with 1 μg of total plasmid DNA composed of pECE/pECE-HA-PKB/MLCK-luc/RL-TK plasmids (ratio 1:1:2:1). Following incubation for 24 h in proliferation medium and 36 h in differentiation medium, transfected cells were harvested for luciferase assay. Activities of firefly andRenilla luciferases were measured sequentially using the luciferase assay kit reagent as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Charbonnieres, France). Microinjections were carried out in growing myoblasts before induction of differentiation or in G0-synchronized REF-52 fibroblasts before serum refeeding, as previously described (26Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,27Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Injected antibodies were affinity-purified rabbit anti-PKBα antibodies (directed against amino acids 453–466 of human PKBα protein; Ref. 22Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), affinity-purified sheep anti-PKBβ antibodies (directed against amino acids 455–469 of rat PKBβ; Euromedex, France), or 1 mg/ml anti-hPKBβ IgGs (directed against amino acid 454–470 of human PKBβ, Ref. 22Meier R.

Prior to injection, purified antibodies (0.3–0.5 mg/ml) or sera were dialyzed against 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and mixed when necessary with rabbit marker antibodies (1 mg/ml). Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as previously described (21Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We have initially determined the expression profiles of PKBα and PKBβ during differentiation of mouse C2.7 cells. To first ensure that the anti-PKB antibodies were isoform-specific, C2.7 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged membrane-targeted forms of either PKBα or PKBβ were examined by immunoblotting. The rabbit anti-PKBα antibody only immunoblotted the overexpressed HA-PKBα protein, whereas the sheep anti-PKBβ antibody detected only the overexpressed HA-PKBβ (Fig.1 A). In addition, at the exposure shown here, PKBβ antibodies only detected HA overexpressed protein whereas anti-PKBα detected both overexpressed (upper band) and endogenous (lower faint band) proteins. As comparable amounts of overexpressed proteins were analyzed (see Fig. 1 A,lane HA), it appears that the anti-PKBβ antibodies have a lower affinity (∼5-fold) than PKBα antibodies against their respective isoforms. Extracts from proliferative or differentiating myoblasts were probed by Western blot for expression of PKB isoforms, myogenin as a differentiation marker, and tubulin as a loading control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, PKBα protein level remains constant throughout differentiation. In contrast, PKBβ expression is up-regulated, as early as 24 h after induction of differentiation, a time that coincides with appearance of the early differentiation marker myogenin. A specific up-regulation of PKBβ was also seen during differentiation of rat L6D2 myoblasts (data not shown). Moreover, when compensating for the different affinities of the anti-PKBα and anti-PKBβ antibodies (see Fig. 1 A), PKBα and PKBβ proteins may be expressed at similar levels in myoblasts, but PKBβ becomes the major isoform expressed in myotubes. We have previously shown that, upon induction of differentiation, a subset of myoblasts escape from the differentiation process and remain in a quiescent undifferentiated mononucleated state (21Kitzmann M. Carnac G. Vandromme M. Primig M. Lamb N.J.C. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To investigate if the observed increase in PKBβ level was directly linked to differentiation, C2.7 myotubes were separated from quiescent cells, and expression of PKBβ was examined by Western blot in these two subpopulations. PKBβ is expressed at similar low levels in proliferative and nondifferentiated quiescent myoblasts (Fig.1 C, compare lanes P and Q), whereas it shows a significant increase in differentiated myotubes (Fig. 1 C, lane M). Expression levels of PKBα are similar in all tested conditions. As expected for a marker of differentiation, troponin T was detected only in the myotube population. Taken together, these results show that PKBα and PKBβ are differentially expressed during differentiation of muscle cells, with PKBβ being up-regulated in a differentiation-dependent manner. Activation of either PKBα or PKBβ occurs through the same mechanisms. Active PI3Ks allow translocation of PKB to the plasma membrane, where its PH domain binds to the PI3K lipid products. Following phosphorylation by two upstream activating kinases, PKB translocates into the nucleus (22Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

In our culture model, myoblasts are allowed to differentiate by lowering serum concentration in the medium. This spontaneous differentiation is possible because of an autocrine production of IGFs by differentiating myoblasts. We first estimated the relative activity of each isoform during the process of spontaneous differentiation by using a kinase assay. PKBα and PKBβ were immunoprecipitated from C2.7 myoblasts or myotubes, and their activity assessed against the Crosstide peptide fused to GST (GST-C) as a substrate. As shown in Fig.2 A, PKBα and PKBβ were found to phosphorylate Crosstide in both myoblasts and myotubes. PKBα activity was slightly increased in myotubes in comparison to myoblasts with similar amounts of protein immunoprecipitated at both stages. PKBβ activity was significantly up-regulated in differentiated myotubes when compared with myoblasts. This increase in PKBβ activity corresponds to an augmentation of immunoprecipitated proteins. For both isoforms, no activity was detected when a mutated non-phosphorylatable Crosstide peptide was used as substrate testifying for specificity of the assay (data not shown). To characterize further the relative activity of each isoforms during spontaneous differentiation, we also looked for the subcellular distribution of PKBα and PKBβ in myoblasts and myotubes, as nuclear translocation of PKB has been described to follow its activation (22Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar,25Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.H.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of mouse C2.7 or rat L6D2 myoblasts and myotubes were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-PKBα or anti-PKBβ antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, PKBα and PKBβ were found distributed in both cytoplasm and nuclei at similar levels in proliferative C2.7 myoblasts. By contrast, only PKBβ was still detected in C2.7 myotube nuclei whereas PKBα was detected only in the cytoplasm. Similar results have been observed when using L6D2 cell extracts (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that PKBα and PKBβ are both active in myoblasts and myotubes, but differ in their subcellular distribution in myotubes with only PKBβ still detectable in the nucleus. This difference in subcellular localization strongly suggests a different function for each isoform during muscle differentiation. To examine whether the two PKB isoforms display similar efficiency in promoting muscle differentiation, we used a classical transactivation assay with a luciferase reporter plasmid (MCK-luc) containing the −1256 base pair upstream region from the muscle creatine kinase, which mediates differentiation-dependent activity in cultured skeletal muscle cells (28Lassar A.B.

Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5058-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of MCK-luc should allow a quantitative measurement of the extent of differentiation. Wild-type and mutant (constitutively active or inactive) forms of PKBα and PKBβ were cotransfected with the MCK-luc construct into C2.7 cells. In each case, plasmid pRL-TK was cotransfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After transfection, cells were placed in proliferation medium for 24 h, and incubated for an additional 36 h in differentiation medium before harvesting and measurement of the reporter gene transactivation by luciferase assay. As shown in Fig. 3, constitutively active PKBα (αm) and PKBβ (βm) significantly promoted MCK-luc activity (up to 3- and 7-fold, respectively) with PKBβm showing a 2-fold higher efficiency than PKBαm. Significantly, wild-type PKBβ also increased transactivation of the reporter gene to a level similar to that obtained with the constitutively active PKBα, whereas wild-type PKBα appeared as inefficient as constitutively inactive mutants, in promoting MCK-luc activity. Expression levels of the different PKB constructs were checked by Western blot and were found to be similar in all tested conditions (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that PKBβ (either wild-type or constitutively active) is more efficient than PKBα in enhancing muscle-specific gene expression. To further investigate the differences between PKBα and PKBβ in myogenic cells, we examined whether targeted inhibition of individual PKB isoforms, through microinjection of specific antibodies, could interfere with differentiation. Such an approach has been successfully used to demonstrate the involvement of key regulatory proteins such as the coactivator p300 (30Puri P.L. Avantaggiati M.L. Balsano C. Sang N. Graessmann A.

Affinity-purified anti-PKBα, anti-PKBβ antibodies mixed with rabbit marker antibodies, or marker antibodies alone were injected into both C2.7 or L6D2 myoblasts. After microinjection cells were switched to the differentiation medium for 48 h and processed for immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 4, only microinjection of anti-PKBβ antibodies blocked differentiation of L6D2 and C2.7 cells by 50% and 48%, respectively, whereas neither anti-PKBα nor marker antibody (data not shown; see also Ref. 26Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), had a significant effect on myogenin expression and fusion of microinjected cells into myotubes. To confirm the requirement of PKBβ for muscle differentiation, we performed a second set of microinjection experiments. We used the rabbit anti-hPKBβ antibodies directed against amino acids 454–470 of the human protein (22Meier R. Alessi D.R. Cron P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30491-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Because these antibodies recognized with high affinity the human protein, injection was carried out in CHM (see “Materials and Methods”) as described above. As shown in Fig.5, microinjection of anti-hPKBβ IgGs into CHM efficiently blocked differentiation. The majority of injected cells remained mononucleated with ∼20% expressing myogenin. Inversely, in control experiments in which myoblasts were microinjected with pre-immune serum, 60% of injected cells were either found in multinucleated myotubes or in mononucleated myocytes expressing myogenin. This percentage of differentiation was similar to that of surrounding noninjected cells. To confirm that the function of PKBα is not necessary for the transition from myoblast to myotube, we further performed microinjection experiments to prove that anti-PKBα antibodies were inhibitory to PKBα. For that purpose, we monitored the effect of microinjected anti-PKB antibodies on cell proliferation of REF-52 fibroblasts, which express both PKBα and PKBβ as probed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Indeed, a recent report described that PKBα is part of a Ras-PI3K-glycogen synthase kinase-3β transduction pathway that positively regulates cyclin D1, a key component of the cell cycle involved in progression of cells through G1 phase (32Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Serum-starved REF-52 fibroblasts were injected with anti-PKBα or anti-PKBβ antibodies, refed with serum to enter the cell cycle and incubated in a medium containing BrdUrd for 20–22 h to follow passage through S phase via DNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 6, BrdUrd incorporation was inhibited in 90% o"

Interferon β increases gene expression at the transcriptional level through binding of factors to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) within the promoters of interferon-inducible genes, such as HLA class I. Despite mutation of the class I ISRE sequence within the nonclassical HLA-G class I gene promoter, we show that interferon β enhances both transcription and cell surface expression of HLA-G in trophoblasts and amniotic and thymic epithelial cells that selectively express it in vivo. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis of a putative interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 binding site within the HLA-G promoter show that HLA-G transactivation is mediated through an ISRE sequence 746 base pairs upstream from ATG, which is distinct from the interferon-responsive element described within proximal classical class I gene promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and supershift analysis further demonstrate that interferon-responsive transcription factors, including IRF-1, specifically bind to the HLA-G ISRE. Our results provide evidence that IRF-1 binding to a functional ISRE within the HLA-G promoter mediates interferon β-induced expression of the HLA-G gene.

Type I interferons are produced by many cell types (e.g. macrophages, T cells, keratinocytes, and Langerhans cells) in response to viral or bacterial infection and tumors. They display pleiotropic effects on the immune system, including stimulation of NK cells and macrophage activation, T-cell activation and survival, and up-regulation of various genes such as IFN-γ and major histocompatibility complex class I (26Hunter C.A. Gabriel K.E. Radzanowski T. Neyer L.E. Remington J.S. Immunol. Lett. 1997; 59: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cascade of events that yield to IFN type I induction involves activation of Jak/STAT transduction pathways and transactivation of inducible gene promoter through the ISRE regulatory element, a binding site for ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) or IRFs (27Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R. Reich N. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). After binding to its receptor, IFN type I induces translocation of activated STAT1 and STAT2 into the nucleus and formation of a heterotrimeric complex containing p48/ISGF3γ (ISGF3). Among transcription factors belonging to the IRF family, IRF-1 and IRF-2 are secondary IFN response factors that interact mainly with ISRE to activate or repress target promoter activity (29Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar).Another well-characterized IFN cis-acting regulatory element is the IFN-γ activation site (GAS), which rather mediates the immediate response of several genes to IFN-γ (30Lew D.J. Decker T. Strehlow I. Darnell J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).The pattern of HLA-G expression is tightly regulated due to cell-specific transcriptional control, but the regulatory pathways controlling its tissue-specific transactivation remain to be established. HLA-G gene expression can be activated by interleukin 10 (31), glucocorticoids, or stress treatment (32Ibrahim E.C. Morange M. Dausset J. Carosella E. Paul P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) independently of classical HLA class I genes or by IFNs (33Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod.

We report that IFN-β up-regulates HLA-G transcription through promoter transactivation and binding of IFN-responsive factors, including IRF-1, to a functional ISRE mapped at 746 bp from the ATG, within the HLA-G promoter.DISCUSSIONA previous study reported the ability of IFN-β to enhance levels of HLA-G surface antigens, but these data remained preliminary because they were only reported on transfected mouse fibroblasts. Although IFN-β was identified as a potent inductor of HLA-G transcription in other cell types (33Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1995; 29: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Yang Y. Chu W. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4224-4231PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chu W. Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the regulatory pathways yielding to this transactivation were not elucidated. Indeed, little is known about sequences and factors that participate in transactivation of the HLA-G promoter, in which most of the conserved regulatory DNA elements involved in the constitutive and cytokine-induced expression of the HLA class I genes are disrupted and nonfunctional.Our findings represent the first evidence of HLA-G modulation and overall IFN-β-mediated up-regulation of HLA class I cell surface expression in amnion and thymic epithelial cells expressing HLA-G. We also show that IFN-β-mediated enhancement of the level of HLA-G surface antigens was comparable to that of classical HLA class I surface antigens and was correlated to an overall enhancement of the levels of HLA-G transcripts. The extent of up-regulation of HLA-G transcript levels we observed in IFN-β-treated primary cells, cell lines, and trophoblast tissue was in agreement with the 2–2.5-fold enhancement reported previously and may not be attributed to increased stability of mRNA but rather to stimulation of the HLA-G transcription rate (35Chu W. Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results confirm that IFN-β is a potent inducer of HLA-G transcription, which may explain the effect observed at the surface of HLA-G-expressing cells, although a posttranscriptional effect of IFN-β on HLA-G enhancement cannot be excluded.We further elucidated part of the regulatory mechanisms involved in IFN-β induction of HLA-G transcription. We have identified a functional ISRE at position −746 bp from the ATG within the distal HLA-G promoter, and we demonstrate that this site is necessary to confer IFN-β transactivation of the 1.4-kb HLA-G gene promoter fragment. This ISRE does not appear to be conserved among other classical HLA class I promoters and could represent a locus-specific pathway of IFN-β-mediated induction of the nonclassical HLA-G class I antigen. We also demonstrate that the GAS element, lying downstream of the ISRE, does not play a role in IFN-β transactivation of HLA-G.Previous studies on the transactivating effect of the ISRE element upon IFN stimulation point out that both enhancer A and site α are crucial for maximal induction of HLA class I genes through the ISRE (37Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2276-2283PubMed Google Scholar, 39Gobin S.J. Peijnenburg A. Keijsers V. van den Elsen P.J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The nonclassical HLA-E also contains a specific IFN-γ response region constituted of two adjacent cis-acting regulatory elements, both of which are required to mediate the full response to IFN-γ (48Gustafson K.S. Ginder G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20035-20046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No adjacent cooperative sequence seems to be required for full induction by IFN-β through the functional ISRE within the HLA-G promoter, which identifies the particular nature of IFN-β-mediated HLA-G induction. The level of IFN-β-mediated induction of HLA-G surface antigens was quite well correlated to the level of HLA-G promoter transactivation through the −746 ISRE and was similar to that reported using a transfected HLA-G 6.0-kb fragment containing the 1.4-kb promoter fragment and 3′ sequences (35Chu W. Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the presence of other functional IFN-responsive sites within the HLA-G gene.HLA-G expression can be induced by IFN-α and IFN-γ in transfected mouse fibroblasts (35Chu W. Yang Y. Geraghty D.E. Hunt J.S. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 42: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Whether the functional ISRE is able to mediate transcriptional activation of HLA-G upon both type I IFNs remains to be verified. Interestingly, we have previously reported a lack of activation of the 1.4-kb HLA-G promoter fragment in IFN-γ-treated JEG-3 or in IFN-γ-treated Tera-2 cells (36Lefebvre S. Moreau P. Guiard V. Ibrahim E.C. Adrian-Cabestre F. Menier C. Dausset J. Carosella E.D. Paul P. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1999; 43: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Gobin S.J.P. Keijsers V. Van Zutphen M.

This could suggest that the ISRE mediating the IFN-β response within the HLA-G promoter is not involved in IFN-γ transactivation of HLA-G or requires additional cooperative regulatory elements. These results point out that differential and overlapping mechanisms, including several regulatory pathways and cooperative interactions between cellular factors involved in the specific response to IFNs, regulate IFN-α, -β, and-γ transactivation of HLA-G and other HLA class I genes.We further provide evidence that IRF-1 binds to the functional ISRE within the HLA-G promoter in response to IFN-β and may thus represent a key factor in the regulation of the HLA-G gene in trophoblast, amnion, and thymus-derived cells. Accordingly, IRF-1 is described as the principal transcription factor binding to the ISRE within the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter (49Hobart M. Ramassar V. Goes N. Urmson J. Halloran P.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4260-4269PubMed Google Scholar). Supershift analysis failed to identify other known ISRE-binding proteins such as IRF-2, p48, or STAT1α. An altered activity of the p48/ISGF3γ subunit of the ISGF3 factor has been reported in trophoblast cells (47Cross J.C. Lam S. Yagel S. Werb Z. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 60: 312-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). STAT1-containing complexes binding to HLA class I ISREs were not detected in IFN-γ-treated HeLa cells, unlike such GAS-binding complexes (38Gobin S.J.P. van Zutphen M. Woltman A. Van den Elsen P.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1428-1434PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that ISRE-protein complexes would be barely detectable in supershift experiments.In addition to playing essential roles in IFN responses, IRF-1 proteins are involved in other regulatory processes, i.e. cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, oncogenic activities, apoptosis, and development and function of immune effector cells (50Duncan G.S.

Interleukin 2 and interleukin 12 have been shown to directly induce IRF-1 gene expression in human T and NK cells (52Galon J. Sudarshan C. Ito S. Finbloom D. O'Shea J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7256-7262PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these cytokines that promote cell-mediated immune response could also enhance HLA-G expression through binding of IRF-1 to ISRE should be further investigated in immunocompetent cells.Type I interferons are highly involved in both the innate and specific host protective response, such as the T-cell IFN-γ response to viral infection (53Muller U.

Facing this, viruses have evolved numerous strategies to subvert host defenses, including modulation of major histocompatibility complex class I expression or mimicking host cell genes such as IRF-1 or ILT2 (56Alcami A. Koszinowski U.H. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Alteration of HLA-G or locus-specific class I gene expression may also interfere in the balance between escape from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and maintenance of protection from NK cells (16Onno M.

Given that IFN-β is produced in virally infected trophoblast and amnion (58Carvalho A.F. Santos J.R. Gentz R. Bonjardim C.A. Golgher R.R. Ferreira P.C. Kroon E.G.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), specific pathways of HLA-G modulation could permit infected cells to block NK and T-cell responses, as seen during maternal-fetal transmission of human cytomegalovirus (60Halwachs-Baumann G. Wilders-Truschnig M. Desoye G. Hahn T. Kiesel L. Klingel K. Rieger P. Jahn G. Sinzger C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or human immunodeficiency virus. Alternatively, lysis of infected material could be triggered by CD94/NKG2C receptors through HLA-E surface expression or by HLA-G-restricted T-cell Receptor and thus prevent pathogen spreading from the placental cells to the fetus. IFN-β-mediated HLA-G up-regulation in TECs could also affect selection of the thymic repertoire.Type I interferons are used in the treatment of several human pathologies such as infectious diseases, multiple sclerosis, or tumors. Whether the nonclassical HLA-G molecule is up-regulated during IFN treatment or plays a role in favoring or impairing immune responses to such therapeutic approaches also remains an interesting issue. Indeed, analysis of aberrant expression of HLA-G combined with loss of classical HLA molecules on melanoma cells could have important practical implications for the selection of patients likely not to benefit from interferon α therapy (61Wagner S.N. Rebmann V. Willers C.P. Grosse-Wilde H. Goos M. Lancet. 2000; 356: 220-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Our results point out that IFN-β-mediated enhancement of HLA-G expression may occur as a way to refine modulation of immune responses during pregnancy, thymic involution, or IFN-β treatment of autoimmune diseases and tumor progression. HLA-G is defined as a nonclassical HLA class I antigen (1Kovats S. Main E.K. Librach C. Stubblebine M. Fisher S.J. DeMars R. Science. 1990; 248: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 2Ellis S.A. Sargent I.L. Redman C.W.G. McMichael A.J. Immunology. 1986; 59: 595-601PubMed Google Scholar) that was originally found to be restrictively expressed in the human placenta, where it is thought to play a role in maternal tolerance of the fetal semiallograft. HLA-G expression was further characterized on several placental cell types such as extravillous cytotrophoblasts, amniocytes, or endothelial cells of chorionic vessels and also on subsets of thymic epithelial cells (3Le Bouteiller P. Blaschitz A. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 167: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). HLA-G expression allows down-regulation of both NK1and T lymphocyte cytolytic functions (4Rouas-Freiss N. Khalil-Daher I. Riteau B. Menier C. Paul P. Dausset J. Carosella E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) through interaction with killing inhibitory receptors, namely p49/KIR2DL4, ILT2, and ILT4 (5Lopez-Botet M. Bellon T. Llano M. Navarro F. Garcia P. De Miguel M. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The capacity of HLA-G leader peptides to stabilize surface expression of nonclassical HLA-E antigens also indirectly contributes to modulate cytolytic activity mediated by the widely expressed CD94/NKG2 receptors (6Llano M.

J., and Scrutton, N. S. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 3218–3222). We show here a similar mechanism in TTQ-dependent aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH). The rate of TTQ reduction by dopamine in AADH has a large, temperature independent kinetic isotope effect (KIE = 12.9 ± 0.2), which is highly suggestive of vibrationally assisted tunneling. H-transfer is compromised with benzylamine as substrate and the KIE is deflated (4.8 ± 0.2). The KIE is temperature-independent, but reaction rates are strongly dependent on temperature. With tryptamine as substrate reaction rates can be determined only at low temperature as C–H bond cleavage is rapid, and an exceptionally large KIE (54.7 ± 1.0) is observed. Studies with deuterated tryptamine suggest vibrationally assisted tunneling is the mechanism of deuterium and, by inference, hydrogen transfer. Bond cleavage by MADH using a slow substrate (ethanolamine) occurs with an inflated KIE (14.7 ± 0.2 at 25 °C). The KIE is temperature-dependent, consistent with differential tunneling of protium and deuterium. Our observations illustrate the different modes of H-transfer in MADH and AADH with fast and slow substrates and highlight the importance of barrier shape in determining reaction rate.

Most have been modeled using the classical formulations of transition state theory, incorporating a tunneling correction factor to account for tunneling below the saddle-point of the potential energy surface. In our studies of H-tunneling in MADH, we demonstrated that reaction rates were dependent on temperature, thus providing experimental evidence suggesting a role for thermally induced, vibrational motion of the protein scaffold in driving enzymatic H-transfer (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, similar observations have been made with a thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase (22Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that reduction of the TTQ cofactor by dopamine in AADH also occurs by a vibrationally assisted tunneling mechanism, thus establishing close similarities in the mode of bond breakage with MADH and its physiological substrate, methylamine (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We also show that vibrationally assisted tunneling is the likely mechanism of bond cleavage for the reaction of AADH with the slow substrate, benzylamine. Compromised reaction rates with this substrate are suggested to be a consequence of (i) increased width of the potential energy barrier and (ii) a larger enthalpy of activation for deformation of the protein structure to produce geometries compatible with H-tunneling. By contrast, we also show that reactions of MADH with a slow substrate (ethanolamine) require partial ascent of the potential energy surface to facilitate the tunneling reaction, with D-tunneling occurring higher up the potential energy barrier than H-tunneling. Partial ascent of the barrier is required to reduce the tunneling distance and thereby optimize the probability of transfer. These studies highlight the different strategies used by enzymes to facilitate H-transfer by quantum mechanical tunneling. MADH was purified from M. methylotrophus (sp. W3A1) as described previously (29Davidson V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 188: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

For single wavelength studies, data collected at 440 nm (MADH) and 456 nm (AADH) were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression analysis on an Acorn RISC PC using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Experiments were performed by mixing MADH or AADH contained in the desired buffer, with an equal volume of substrate contained in the same buffer at the desired concentration. The concentration of substrate was always at least 10-fold greater than that of enzyme, thereby ensuring pseudo-first order reaction conditions. For each substrate concentration, at least five replica measurements were collected and averaged. The error for individual rates measured by fitting to a single transient was, in all cases, less than 0.5%of the determined value. Shot-by-shot variability in the determined rate was <5%, and the error for the rate fitted to averaged transients was <0.4%of the determined value. As reported previously for MADH (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and AADH (5Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the absorbance changes accompanying enzyme reduction were monophasic, with a single rate constant obtained from fits of the data to Equation 1. A=Ce−kobst+bEquation 1 C is a constant related to the initial absorbance, and b is an offset value to account for a nonzero base line. Transients obtained for reactions of AADH with tryptamine were biphasic and analyzed using a double exponential expression. The fast phase of these transients (>90%of the total amplitude change) exhibited a very large KIE (54.7 ± 1.0) and thus reflects C–H bond cleavage. The origin of the slow phase remains uncertain, but it may represent hydrolysis of the imine intermediate (intermediate 5; Fig. 1). The small amplitude of the slow phase and studies using stopped-flow photodiode array spectroscopy clearly indicate that the slow phase is not associated with TTQ reduction. The slow phase is not resolved in reactions of AADH with deuterated tryptamine. The transients performed with deuterated dopamine were fitted to Equation 1, but the very early phase (0–30 ms) of the transient was omitted to avoid contamination of the spectral change from any contribution from protiated substrate (the deuterated dopamine was enriched to a minimal level of 94%). Due to the large KIE with dopamine, analysis of the transient from around 30 ms onward using Equation 1 ensured that any spectral change attributable to protiated data was in fact removed from the analysis, while retaining virtually all of the kinetic transient for the deuterated substrate. Although this precaution was taken in data fitting, fits to the entire transient to a single exponential function were excellent (with no obvious deviation in the early time domain) and produced rates identical to those fits performed from 30 ms onwards. These observations suggest that the level of enrichment of the deuterated dopamine was greater than the minimal value (94%) quoted by the supplier. For all substrates of MADH and AADH, the observed rate constants were found to exhibit dependence on substrate concentration and the reductive half-reactions of AADH and MADH were modeled using the following general scheme. A+B⇄k1k2C→k3D REACTION 2Data for MADH (ethanolamine as substrate) were fitted using the simplified equation described by Hiromi (31Hiromi K. Kinetics of Fast Enzyme Reactions. Halsted Press, New York1979Google Scholar) as described previously for MADH with methylamine as substrate (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). kobs=k3[S]K+[S]Equation 3 Here, K is a constant and equal to (k2 +k3)/k1. For multiple wavelength stopped-flow studies, the reaction was monitored using anApplied Photophysics photodiode array detector and operated using XSCAN software. For data analysis of photodiode array, we used PROKIN software (Applied Photophysics). Both AADH and MADH are stable over the temperature range used in the stopped-flow studies. This is evident since the total absorption change for TTQ reduction at all temperatures remains constant and is identical to that observed in spectrophotometric titrations of the enzyme with its substrate. Enzymes were equilibrated for 10 min in the stopped-flow apparatus at the appropriate temperature prior to the acquisition of stopped-flow data. The optimal time for equilibration was determined empirically. Temperature control was achieved using a thermostatic circulating water bath, and the temperature was monitored directly in the stopped-flow apparatus using a semiconductor sensor (model LM35CZ, National Semiconductor). In studies of the temperature dependence of bond cleavage, all substrates were used at saturating concentrations. Studies of the concentration dependence of bond cleavage at 5 °C and 35 °C indicated that the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant (for MADH) and the value of K in Equation 3 (for AADH) were not substantially perturbed on changing temperature. These control experiments thus ensured that substrate was saturating at all the temperatures investigated in the temperature dependence studies with both MADH and AADH. AADH has a broad specificity for primary amine substrates. Davidson and co-workers (5Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have investigated the substrate preference of AADH in steady-state reactions and demonstrated that aromatic substrates are generally preferred over simple aliphatic primary amines. Moreover, a large KIE has been demonstrated with the aromatic substrate dopamine (11Hyun Y.L. Davidson V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have extended the kinetic analysis with dopamine to include studies of the effects of temperature on the KIE. We have also probed the effects of temperature on the KIEs observed with conventional and deuterated forms of benzylamine and tryptamine. The dependence of [dopamine] on the rate of TTQ reduction in AADH is illustrated in Fig. 2 for both deuterium- and protium-labeled substrate. The data are similar to those reported previously with one exception; the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant with dopamine in the present study is much smaller (17.1 ± 0.8 μm) than that reported previously (132 μm; Ref. 5Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The smaller dissociation constant for the Michaelis complex results from the use of buffers of different ionic strength. Univalent cations are known to elicit spectral changes in AADH, consistent with the presence of a univalent cation-binding site in AADH (33Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present work, the [dopamine] dependence of TTQ reduction was performed at low ionic strength (10 mm BisTris propane buffer, pH 7.5), whereas previous studies were conducted at high ionic strength (0.25m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; Ref. 5Hyun Y.-L. Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12249-12254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ionic strength effects are limited to binding since the limiting rate of TTQ reduction is similar in both the low and high ionic strength regimes. The dependence of the TTQ reduction rate on [deuterated dopamine] is also shown in Fig. 2. The term (k2 +k3)/k1 is larger with dopamine (∼17 μm) than with deuterated dopamine (∼12 μm). Similar effects were seen with other substrates of AADH (Figs. 3 and 4). The larger k3Hthan k3D might account for this observation with AADH (Equation 3). However, there might be an additional contribution arising from the known differences in the chemical nature of the C–H versus the C–D bond (34Van Hook W.A. Collins C.J. Bowman N.S. Isotope Effects in Chemical Reactions. van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1971: 1-89Google Scholar). This is necessary to explain the difference ink2/k1 (i.e. an isotope effect on binding) for MADH obtained from fitting to Equation 2(see Fig. 6 and previous work with methylamine (Ref. 8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar)). For example, (i) the smaller effective bond length of C–D versus C–H (the latter has a higher zero point energy and therefore lies higher in the asymmetric potential energy well) results in a smaller effective size of C–D relative to C–H; (ii) the shorter C–D bond results in a larger charge density, and is therefore electron supplying relative to C–H; and (iii) C–H has a higher dipole moment than C–D. The expectation, therefore, is that the combined effects of multiple isotopic substitution will perturb the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. These effects will likely be pronounced in those cases where the isotopically substituted group is the main determinant in formation of the enzyme-substrate complex (as is the case with methylamine).Figure 3Stopped-flow kinetic data for the reaction of AADH with tryptamine and deuterated tryptamine.

A predicted upper value for the secondary KIE is 1.15 for reactions involving a change in hybridization (sp 3 to sp 2) (43Klinman J.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 46: 415-494PubMed Google Scholar), which represents ∼8%of the observed KIE. (Fig.1). An indication as to whether H-transfer occurs classically or by quantum tunneling can be gained by investigating the temperature dependence of the rates of C–H and C–D bond cleavage using the unimolecular rate Equation 4 (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). k=kBhTe−ΔG‡/RT=kBhTe−ΔH‡/RT·eΔS‡/REquation 4 kB and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. Temperature-dependent rate data can be plotted conveniently using the following form of the Eyring equation. ln(k/T)=ln(kB/h)+ΔS‡/R−ΔH‡/RTEquation 5 The enthalpy of activation ΔH ‡ is calculated from the slope of the plot, ΔS ‡is calculated by extrapolation to the ordinate axis, and ΔG ‡ is then calculated directly from Equation 4. As discussed previously (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), the use of Equation 5 in plotting the temperature dependence of a unimolecular reaction is preferred over the use of the classical Arrhenius plot. This arises because the Arrhenius equation is in fact curved (although it appears linear in the accessible temperature range) and asymptotically approaches infinity at high temperatures. A consequence of using Equation 5 is the need to define explicitly the meaning of values obtained from such plots. Use of the Arrhenius plot has led to the development of criteria to indicate tunneling based on the values for ΔΔEa and theA H:A D ratio (calculated from the intercepts of the Arrhenius plot for protium and deuterium substrates). The corresponding parameters calculated from the slopes and intercepts of plots using Equation 5 are ΔΔH ‡andA′H:A′D (the prime is used to distinguish this ratio from theA H:A D ratio calculated from the Arrhenius plot). Analysis of the temperature dependence of k3using Equation 5 is illustrated in Fig.2. The data indicate that the KIE is independent of temperature and that the difference in the enthalpy of activation for protium versus deuterium transfer (ΔΔH ‡ = ΔH ‡D − ΔH ‡H = 0.7 ± 1.5 kJ mol−1) is essentially zero. The value of theA′H:A′D ratio (9.4 ± 1.6) calculated from the intercepts of the plots is similar to that of the KIE (12.8 ± 0.2), indicating that the reaction proceeds predominantly by quantum tunneling. Observations similar to those discussed above for the temperature-dependent behavior of C–H bond breakage in AADH have been made during cleavage of a substrate C–H bond by the TTQ-dependent methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) of M. methylotrophus. For MADH the data were interpreted in terms of vibrationally assisted tunneling of protium and deuterium through a fluctuating potential energy barrier (8Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our data for the reaction catalyzed by AADH indicate that this mechanistically similar enzyme catalyzes H-transfer by ground state tunneling of protium and deuterium and that tunneling is driven by the thermal motion. The KIE data with dopamine indicate that H-transfer is not by the classical, over-the-barrier route and that quantum tunneling is the mechanism of transfer. Mo"

Unlike α subunits that exhibit overall structural similarity to various voltage-gated ion channels, auxiliary subunits are diverse and show specificity for association with particular classes of K+ channels.

Previous studies have established that Kvβ1, -2, and -3 gene products are components of Kv1 family channels. Indeed, all products from the four genes contain a conserved core region with variable N-terminal peptides. The core region of β subunits was found to be sufficient for association with a part of the N terminus of Kv1 family α subunits that is highly conserved within this family (5Yu W. Xu J. Li M.

However, more recent studies indicate that Kvβ subunits can interact with heterologously expressed Kv4.2 (7Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, it appeared that Kvβ4 subunits are present as complexes with Kv2.2 proteins in rat brain (10Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26341-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Likewise, plant Kvβ subunits (KAB) are associated with KAT1 channels (11Tan H. Vasconcelos A.C. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1545-1553PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, auxiliary Kvβ subunits are structurally well characterized, yet the specificity and mechanism of interaction between Kvα and β subunits remain obscure. Kvβ subunits influence expression and function of K+channels. Specifically, distinct Kvβ subunits differentially affect heterologously expressed Kv1 family channels. A long-stretched N-terminal peptide in Kvβ1 and Kvβ3 gene products produces rapid inactivation on most of Kv1 family channels by a mechanism similar to the action of a ball peptide present at the N terminus of some channel α subunits (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lora C. Parcej D.N. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Kvβ2 subunits have been shown to increase stability and cell surface expression of Kv1 family channels (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) without producing rapid inactivation. Thus, expression of distinct Kvβ subunits controls excitability by differentially affecting the expression and gating of Kv1 family channels. Although many studies have shown that Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 subunits can associate with heterologously expressed channels from diverse families, it remains unclear whether these auxiliary subunits are present as complexes with non-Kv1 family channels in native cells. Furthermore, structural features of the interaction between Kvβ subunits and non-Kv1 family channel polypeptides remain unknown. To address these questions, we examined complexes consisting of Kvβ and Kv4.3 channel subunits. We show here that Kv4.3 proteins are associated with Kvβ2 subunits in the brain and that this interaction requires the C terminus of the channel polypeptide. Rat Kv4.3 short (14Dixon J.E. Shi W.

Chimeric constructs between Kv4.3 short splicing form and Kv2.1 were made using a two-step overlapped polymerase chain reaction with primers that corresponded to the border region of Kv4.3 and Kv2.1 sequences. Kv4.3-Kv2.1N contains amino acids 1–184 of rat Kv2.1 polypeptide (16Frech G.C. VanDongen A.M.J. Shuster G. Brown A.M. Joho R.H.

Kv4.3-Kv2.1C consists of amino acids 1–406 of the Kv4.3 polypeptide connected to amino acids 413–853 of the Kv2.1 polypeptide. For coisolation experiments, wild type and chimeric channel cDNAs were subcloned in-frame into pcDNA3.1/HisC vector (Invitrogen) using a polymerase chain reaction-based method. GFP-tagged Kvβ subunit constructs were prepared by subcloning the whole coding region of Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ2.1 cDNAs at the end of enhanced green fluorescent protein-coding sequence of EGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA). All the obtained constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method (Transfinity, Life Technologies, Inc.). For patch clamp recording, pCMV-Kv4.3 alone (0.3 μg for 60-mm dish) or in combination with 5×-excess pCMV-Kvβ1.1 or pCMV-Kvβ2.1 were used. In addition, EGFP-C1 plasmid (50 ng/60-mm dish) was cotransfected to aid in the identification of transfected cells. Transfected cells in 60-mm plates were split into 35-mm dishes 5 h after transfection and used for whole-cell recordings 48–72 h after transfection. For immunoblot analysis, cells on 100-mm plates were transfected with expression constructs at the same ratio as for patch clamp recording (0.9 μg of pCMV-Kv4.3/dish). Transfected cells were divided into five 60-mm plates at various densities 5 h after transfection and used for immunoblot analysis at various days after transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by suspending the collected cell pellet in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfoxide, and 1 mm EDTA). The suspension was kept on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclear debris. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording (17Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.

Patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Bath solution contained 155 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Series resistance compensation was set at 70%. Peak currents were converted into conductance (G) by the formula G = I/(V m −V rev) assuming a reversal potentialV rev of −84 mV, where V m is the membrane voltage of depolarization pulses. Using the first-order Boltzmann equation G/G max = 1/(1 + exp[(V ½ − V)/slope factor]), the half-maximal voltages (V ½) and the slope factors were acquired. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Mann-Whitney two-tailed test. All the data in the text are presented as means ± S.E. Two days after transfection, transfected HEK 293 cells on 100-mm dishes were harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Triton extract was prepared by suspending the pelleted cells in 0.4 ml of solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The extract was mixed with 100 μl (50% slurry) of preactivated His-bind resin (Novagen, Milwaukee WI) for 2 h with gentle shaking. The resin was washed 5× with the same solution, except that the imidazole concentration was 40 mm. The bound materials were then eluted with 0.1m EDTA. Immunoprecipitation was performed with polyclonal anti-panKvβ antibody (18Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or monoclonal anti-Kv4.3 antibody. The latter antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a part of the N terminus of rat Kv4.3 polypeptide (amino acids 25–40) CPMPLAPADKNKRQDE. 2J. S. Trimmer, manuscript in preparation. Whole rat brain tissue was homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose solution supplemented with 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 mm phenylmethyl sulfonate, and 1 mm EDTA. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove nuclear debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The nuclei-free membrane fraction was suspended in a solution containing 2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm iodoacetamide at a protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. Triton extract was then obtained by centrifugation of the suspension at 100,000 × g for 30 min. After preclearing with fixed protein A-containing Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), Triton extract was incubated overnight with monoclonal anti-Kv4.3 or polyclonal anti-pan Kvβ (20Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibody and Pansorbin. The bound materials were collected by centrifugation and washed 4× with the same Triton-containing solution. The bound materials were eluted by heating in 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was coated with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Primary antibodies against Kv4.3, GFP, and Express tag were purchased from Alomone labs (Jerusalem, Israel), MBL Internat ional Corp. (Watertown MA), and Invitrogen, respectively. Anti-Kv1.4 (18Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), anti-Kv2.1 (19Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10764-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and polyclonal anti-panKvβ (20Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies were previously generated. Bound antibody was detected by chemiluminescence method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoreactivity was quantified using densitometry of the developed films. Confocal Images of GFP fluorescence were taken on a Molecular Dynamic 2001 scanning laser confocal microscope with a 60× oil immersion objective lens (1.4 NA) using 488-nm excitation and 510-nm emission filters with 3% maximal laser intensity. Cell surface localization was evaluated by comparing the location of fluorescence with bright field images of cells. To test for the presence of Kv4.3·Kvβ subunit complexes, we first used anti-Kv4.3 monoclonal antibody for immunoprecipitation from rat brain extract. Anti-Kv4.3 antibody effectively and specifically precipitated its targeted channel proteins but not Kv1.4 proteins (Fig.1 A). Importantly, the immunoprecipitated material was found to contain significant immunoreactive Kvβ subunit proteins detected with polyclonal anti-panKvβ antibody (20Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody detects two bands on the blot with distinct sizes. The larger and smaller bands are known to correspond to Kvβ1 and Kvβ2, respectively (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Trimmer J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10764-10768Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the larger band may also contain Kvβ3 subunits. We found that only smaller molecular weight Kvβ2 subunits were significant in the precipitated material. To further obtain evidence for the presence of Kv4.3·Kvβ complexes in the brain, anti-panKvβ antibody was used for immunoprecipitation from the brain extract (Fig.1 B). The antibody precipitated significant Kv4.3 proteins in addition to its targeted proteins. In contrast, no detectable Kv2.1 proteins were found in the precipitated material. Hence, brain Kv4.3 channel proteins are present in association with Kvβ2 subunits. Functional consequences of Kvβ subunit association on Kv4.3 channels was examined in transfected HEK 293 cells. We first examined the effect of Kvβ subunits on Kv4.3 current density. Coexpression of either Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 subunits led to a 2–3-fold increase in the peak current density (Fig.2); at +50 mV, peak current density was 0.5 ± 0.05 nA/pF (n = 6) for Kv4.3 alone, 1.7 ± 0.4 nA/pF (n = 5) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ1.1, and 1.8 ± 0.5 nA/pF (n = 5) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ2.1. Increases in current density produced by Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 subunits were significant at test pulses higher than −20 mV (p< 0.05). No significant change in HEK 293 cell endogenous current was detected; peak current density at +50 mV was 39.2 ± 8.7 pA/pF (n = 4) for mock transfection, 29.3 ± 9.9 pA/pF (n = 4) for Kvβ1.1, and 39.7 ± 7.1 pA/pF (n = 4) for Kvβ2.1. Thus, Kvβ subunits increase functional cell surface Kv4.3 channels. To test if this elevation in current density was correlated with an increase in Kv4.3 protein level, we measured channel proteins by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3 A). The Kv4.3 protein level significantly increased when coexpressed with Kvβ2.1 subunits 3 or 4 days after transfection (Fig. 3 B,n = 6, p < 0.05). In contrast, coexpression of these auxiliary subunits did not produce changes in Kv2.1 protein levels. Similar increases in Kv4.3 proteins were also produced by Kvβ1.1 at 3 days after transfection (Fig. 3 C). Hence, Kvβ subunits increase total cellular Kv4.3 protein level. Next we examined the gating properties of Kv4.3 channels with or without coexpression of Kvβ subunits. Excess Kvβ subunits (α:β = 1:5) were used to enhance formation of Kv4.3·Kvβ complexes. Kvβ subunits have been shown to shift voltage dependence of activation of Kv1 family channels to the left. However, we found that Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 subunits produce no significant change in voltage dependence of activation of Kv4.3 channels (Fig.4 A). The voltage for half-maximal activation and the slope factor were −7.00 ± 1.08 mV and 14.0 ± 0.99 mV (n = 5) for Kv4.3 alone, −7.83 ± 1.01 mV and 15.8 ± 0.96 mV (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ1.1, and −8.43 ± 1.13 mV and 14.4 ± 1.05 mV (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ2.1, respectively. Thus, Kvβ subunits do not influence activation of Kv4.3 channels. The most profound effect produced by Kvβ subunits on Kv1 family channels is acceleration of inactivation, due to the ball and chain mechanism. Thus, the effect of Kvβ1.1, which contains a ball peptide, as well as Kvβ2.1 on inactivation properties of Kv4.3 channels was examined. Coexpression of these auxiliary subunits did not significantly affect time constant of inactivation (Fig.4 B); time constant for inactivation at +50 mV was 50.5 ± 5.1 ms for Kv4.3 alone (n = 5), 52.6 ± 4.3 ms (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ1.1, and 57.2 ± 2.2 ms (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ2.1. We also measured the steady-state inactivation using a test pulse to +40 mV after a conditioning prepulse at various voltages (Fig. 4, C andD). The voltage for half-maximal inactivation and the slope factor were −48.4 ± 0.33 mV and −5.2 ± 0.3 mV (n = 5) for Kv4.3 alone, −41.5 ± 0.23 mV and −6.8 ± 0.2 mV (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ1.1, and −47.2 ± 0.45 mV and −6.85 ± 0.4 mV (n = 4) for Kv4.3 + Kvβ2.1. Therefore, Kvβ subunits, regardless of the presence of a ball peptide, do not influence inactivation of Kv4.3 channels. We also determined whether association with Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 might influence the recovery from inactivation (Fig. 4, E andF). A protocol of two consecutive depolarizing test pulses interrupted by variable interpulse intervals at −70 mV was used to determine the time course of recovery from inactivation (Fig.4 E). The recovery from inactivation was fitted by a single exponential function. Time constant for recovery from inactivation was 181 ± 24 ms for Kv4.3 alone (n = 6), 169 ± 11 ms for Kv4.3 + Kvβ1.1 (n = 5), and 176 ± 38 ms for Kv4.3 + Kvβ2.1 (Fig. 4 F, n = 5). Thus, Kvβ subunits do not affect recovery from inactivation. Taken together, Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ2.1 subunits produce no marked effects on Kv4.3 channel gating. To assess association of Kv channel α subunits with Kvβ subunits, we first examined localization of GFP-tagged Kvβ subunits upon coexpression of various channel proteins. Confocal microscopy revealed that GFP-Kvβ2.1 (Fig.5 A) or GFP-Kvβ1.1 (data not shown) were predominantly present in the cytosol in the absence of channel α subunits. Coexpression of Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 proteins as well as Kv1.4 proteins, but not Kv2.1 proteins, localized the fluorescence to plasma membrane (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, a splicing variant of Kv4.3, which contains a 19-amino acid insertion at the C terminus (15Takimoto K. Li D. Hershman K.M. Li P. Jackson E.K. Levitan E.S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), targeted GFP-Kvβ fusion proteins to plasma membrane. Thus, Kv4 family channel proteins regardless of the presence or absence of the insertion can associate with Kvβ subunits. Kv1 family channels interact with Kvβ subunits via a highly conserved region of the N terminus. Although the corresponding region of Kv4 family polypeptides exhibits significant sequence homology, this peptide itself was insufficient for association with Kvβ subunits (5Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,6Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To identify the region important for association, we generated chimeric channel proteins consisting of Kv4.3 and Kv2.1 polypeptides. If chimeric proteins are capable of interacting with Kvβ subunits, the fluorescence would be expected in plasma membrane or other membrane-associated compartments. Replacing the N terminus of Kv4.3 protein with that of Kv2.1 polypeptide (Kv4.3-Kv2.1N) did not affect the ability to localize Kvβ2.1 (Fig. 5 B) and Kvβ1.1 (data not shown) subunits to plasma membrane and other membrane-associated regions. In contrast, substituting the C terminus of Kv4.3 protein with that of Kv2.1 protein (Kv4.3-Kv2.1C) eliminated plasma membrane localization of the fluorescence. This chimeric channel (Kv4.3-Kv2.1C) was functional as confirmed by patch clamp recording (data not shown). Thus, the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of Kv4.3 polypeptide is required for localizing Kvβ subunits at plasma membrane. We also used protein biochemical assays to test association. Histidine (His6)-tagged wild type and chimeric channel proteins were expressed with Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 subunits. After purification with His-binding beads, copurified Kvβ subunit proteins were examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 6). Significantly higher levels of immunoreactive Kvβ1.1 or Kvβ2.1 proteins were recovered from cells coexpressed with Kv4.3 or Kv4.3-Kv2.1N than those with Kv2.1 or Kv4.3-Kv2.1C. These results demonstrate that the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of Kv4.3 channels is necessary for association with Kvβ subunits. Kvβ subunits have been suggested to interact with various K+ channels including Kv2.2 (10Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26341-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Kv4.2 (7Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6389-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and plant KAT1 (11Tan H. Vasconcelos A.C. Berkowitz G.A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1545-1553PubMed Google Scholar) channels in addition to Kv1 family channels. In particular, Kv4.2 channels were found to interact with Kvβ1 and -2 subunits in heterologous expression systems (7Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7084-7089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Pérez-Garcı́a M.T. López-López J.R. Conzález C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), suggesting that the same Kvβ subunits might form complexes with K+ channels from the two different families. However, previous studies had not addressed whether such association actually occurs with native channels and did not identify a physiological effect of the association. In this study, we have shown that Kv4.3 proteins are associated with Kvβ2 subunits in the brain. We also found that coexpression of Kvβ subunits leads to increases in Kv4.3 current density and protein level without altering gating properties. Finally, this association requires the C terminus, but not the N terminus, of the channel polypeptide. Thus, the same Kvβ2 subunits influence expression and function of channels from the two different families by distinct interaction mechanisms. Association of Kvβ subunits appeared to produce different effects on interacting channels. Our results indicate that the ball peptide of Kvβ1.1 does not alter inactivation of Kv4.3 channels. Similarly, it has been shown that Kvβ1 does not markedly influence inactivation kinetics of Kv4.1 (21Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H-R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Kv4.2, (8Pérez-Garcı́a M.T. López-López J.R. Conzález C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and Drosophila Shal (5Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) channels. Likewise, Drosophila Kvβ subunit HK was unable to produce rapid inactivation on EAG or ERG channels (9Wilson G.F. Wang Z. Chouinard S.W. Griffith L.C. Ganetzky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6389-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of Kvβ subunit ball peptide depends on associating channels. The lack of the ball peptide effect may be due to differences in the ball peptide-accepting structure of channels. Recent work indicated that a difference in the amino acid sequence in a small region of the linker between S4 and S5 affects the interaction with the Kvβ1 ball peptide (22Lombardi S.J. Truong A. Spence P. Rhodes K.J. Jones P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30092-30096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To support this possibility, one of the important amino acids identified in the above-mentioned study, Arg-324 in Kv1.1, is altered to serine at the corresponding position (Ser-421) in Kv4.3. Another possibility is that Kvβ subunits are positioned in such a way that the ball peptide cannot access the internal pore region of Kv4.3 channels. Since we found that structural requirement for association with Kvβ subunits differs between Kv1 family and Kv4.3 channels, it is possible that the relation of a Kvβ tetramer to a Kv4.3α tetramer does not allow the ball peptide to act on its receptor region of the channel. In addition to the difference in rapid inactivation, a recent study revealed that sensitivity to O2 tension differs between Kvβ subunit-associated Kv4.2 and Shaker channels (8Pérez-Garcı́a M.T. López-López J.R. Conzález C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In analogy to the difference in rapid inactivation, this difference in hypoxia response may arise from distinct ability of channels to respond O2 tension signals. Alternatively, specific interaction of Kv4.2 channels with Kvβ subunits may be essential for the regulation. Further structural and functional information of channel complexes may resolve these issues. In contrast to specific alterations in channel gating, association of Kvβ subunits commonly increases current amplitude or density of various channels. This has been observed with Kv1 family (13Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.E. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), Kv2.2 (10Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26341-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and EAG family (9Wilson G.F. Wang Z. Chouinard S.W. Griffith L.C. Ganetzky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6389-6394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) channels. Our results also revealed that Kvβ subunits increase Kv4.3 current density and proteins. In addition to Kvβ subunits, other channel auxiliary subunits for K+channels as well as Na+ and Ca2+ channels have been shown to increase associating channel current density. It is assumed that the exit from endoplasmic reticulum is the rate-limiting step for plasma membrane protein targeting. Therefore, the generally observed increase in current density by various auxiliary subunits may be due to masking of endoplasmic reticulum retention signals present in channel proteins. This mechanism has been implicated for controlling selective cell surface expression of heteromeric ATP-sensitive K+ channel complexes (23Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 24Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (25Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. DeWaard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that some of the Kvβ subunit effect on Kv4.3 channel current density and proteins may be due to masking potential endoplasmic reticulum retention signals in the channel polypeptide. However, our previous study found that GFP-tagged Kv1.4 and Kv1.5 channels are efficiently transported to plasma membrane in the absence of Kvβ subunits (26Burke N.A. Takimoto K. Li D. Han W. Watkins S.C. Levitan E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 27Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found efficient plasma membrane localization of GFP-tagged Kv4.3 (data not shown). Furthermore, coexpression of Kvβ subunits produced no apparent changes in localization of these GFP-tagged channel proteins. Thus, it is likely that Kvβ subunits increase Kv4.3 as well as Kv1 family proteins in endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane. This stabilization effect is further supported by our finding that the Kvβ effect on Kv4.3 protein level is larger at longer times after transfection. Hence, Kv4.3·Kvβ complexes are likely more stable than those without these auxiliary subunits. Despite the similarity between Kv4 and Kv1 family polypeptides, our data indicate that the two family proteins exhibit distinct requirements for interaction with Kvβ subunits. A part of the N terminus of Kv1 family polypeptide is sufficient for association (5Yu W. Xu J. Li M. Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,6Sewing S. Roeper J. Pongs O. Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results demonstrated that the corresponding region of Kv4 family peptide is not necessary. Instead, the association requires the C terminus of Kv4.3 polypeptide. The importance of the C terminus for interaction with Kvβ subunits was also suggested in Kv2.2·Kvβ4 complex formation; a part of the C terminus of Kv2.2 protein is required for the increase in current density produced by Kvβ4 coexpression in Xenopus oocytes (10Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Heurteaux C. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26341-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the C terminus of Kv2.2 and Kv4 family polypeptides is likely to be involved in association with Kvβ subunits. The apparent lack of sequence similarity between the N terminus of Kv1 family and the C termini of Kv2.2 or Kv4.3 polypeptides suggest that the interaction between Kvα and -β subunits may be more complex than previously assumed. To further elucidate interaction mechanisms, we generated a chimeric Kv2.1 channel containing the C terminus of Kv4.3 polypeptide. We found that this chimera does not efficiently associate with Kvβ subunits (data not shown), suggesting that the Kv4.3 C terminus may not be sufficient for association. However, this chimera was found to be nonfunctional. Therefore, misfolding of this chimeric channel protein might be responsible for the observed lack of interaction. Thus, a simple explanation for the requirement of the C terminus is that this peptide interacts with a site of Kvβ polypeptide that is distinct from one for the Kv1 family N terminus. Alternatively, the C terminus may indirectly participate in interaction. For example, the C-terminal peptide interacts with other part of the channel protein to place an association site in a position for efficient interaction with these auxiliary subunits. More detailed analyses are required to differentiate these possibilities. Recently identified Ca2+-binding subunits (KChIP) are likely to play important roles in controlling the expression and function of Kv4 family channels (28An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.-P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In addition, our results indicate that Kv4.3 channels are present, at least in part, in association with Kvβ2 subunits in brain. The association of non-Kv1 family channels with Kvβ subunits may have pronounced effects under physiological conditions. Although mutations in Drosophila Kvβ subunitHK and Kv1 channel Shaker resulted in almost identical electrophysiological changes in some giant neurons, alterations in other types of neurons caused by these HK mutations were distinct from those by Shaker mutations (29Yao W-D. Wu C-F. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 2472-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction of Kvβ subunits with non-Kv1 channels is likely to play important roles in controlling neuronal excitability. Our results indicate that the major effect produced by Kvβ subunits on Kv4 family channels is to increase the number of functional channels. The association of Kvβ subunits may also have other regulatory functions on these channels, such as sensing redox state of the cell. A novel interaction mechanism between Kv4 family channels and Kvβ subunits may be important for these regulatory functions. Hence, Kvβ subunits control neuronal excitability by influencing expression and function of Kv1 and Kv4 family channels. We thank Drs. J. E. Dixon and D. McKinnon for rat Kv4.3 cDNA and Dr. J. S.

We show that blocking the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) in the postsynaptic neuron can abolish this drop. The regulation is induced prematurely by 1-2 hr of electrical stimulation in P10 collicular slices only if CaN and NMDAR currents can be activated in the neuron. These data suggest that a long-lasting, CaN-mediated control of NMDAR kinetics is rapidly initiated by heightened activity of the NMDAR itself and demonstrate a novel developmental and tonic function of CaN that can play an important role in modulating the plasticity of the developing CNS."

RNA polymerase II, which is mainly responsible for transcribing protein coding genes, consists of twelve subunits, named Rpb1–12, from largest to smallest (2Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3, and Rpb11 subunits are the functional and structural homologues of bacterial core subunits. Along with accessory Rpb subunits, RNA polymerase II uses additional proteins called general transcription factors (GTFs)1to initiate transcription in a promoter-dependent fashion (reviewed in Refs. 3Reinberg D. Orphanides G. Ebright R. Akoulitchev S. Carcamo J. Cho H. Cortes P. Drapkin R. Flores O. Ha I. Inostroza J. Kim S. Kim T. Kumar P. Lagrange T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 83-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 4Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The accessory Rpbs and GTFs seem to play a role analogous to that of the ς subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerases, which enable the core catalytic enzyme (α2ββ′) to bind specifically to start site regions, initiate transcription efficiently, and respond to regulatory inputs. Several characteristics of a heterodimeric complex ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae Rpb4 and Rpb7 bear resemblance to prokaryotic ς factors; the Rbp4-Rpb7 complex is absolutely required for accurate initiation but dispensable for RNA chain elongation (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the complex can associate reversibly with core (10-subunit) RNA polymerase II (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits are less abundant than other polymerase subunits in vivo (6Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and appear to be critical for cellular adaptations to stress, a hallmark of many ς factors (6Choder M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6984-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Maillet I. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Labarre J. J. Biol.

Varon M. Choder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of Rpb7 in wild-type yeast induces cell filamentation, suggesting that Rpb7 may promote gene-specific transcription (10Khazak V. Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 759-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rpb7 is essential for cell viability in yeast (11McKune K. Richards K.L. Edwards A.M. Young R.A. Woychik N.A. Yeast. 1993; 9: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) but Rpb4 is not (12Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Some of the stress-sensitive phenotypes linked to anrpb4 null mutation are suppressed by overproduction of Rpb7 (9Sheffer A. Varon M. Choder M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence suggests that the yeast Rpb4 subunit may facilitate association of Rpb7 with core polymerase (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Rpb7 subunit is key to the transcriptional activity of the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex. Here we show that Rpb7 contains a putative OB-fold domain that seems structurally and topologically related to a subfamily of domains typically found in proteins involved in ssRNA and ssDNA binding. Biochemical studies with wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 complex and variants with targeted mutations in this domain reveal a possible link between nucleic acid-binding activity and an essential step in promoter utilization that occurs after formation of a stable preinitiation complex. Open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from yeast genomic DNA using primers containing an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end and a BamHI restriction site at the 3′ end of each ORF. The RPB4 gene was subcloned into the pET15b bacterial expression plasmid (Novagen), appending a hexahistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site to the N terminus of Rpb4. The DNA insert encoding His-tagged Rpb4 was excised with XbaI andBamHI and ligated between the XbaI andBglII sites of the baculovirus transfer vector PacAB 4 (Pharmingen) to create PacAB 4/RPB4. The RPB7 gene was cloned into PacAB 4/RPB4 between the SmaI andBamHI sites to create PacAB 4/RPB4/7. To create recombinant baculoviruses, PacAB 4/RPB4/7 was cotransfected into Sf9 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation with 0.5 μg of baculovirus Goldtm digested with Bsu 36I (New England BioLabs). Recombinant virus containing the RPB4 andRPB7 genes, identified by blue/white plaque screening, was plaque-purified twice and then amplified for large-scale protein expression. To prepare individual Rpb4 and Rpb7 recombinant baculoviruses,RPB4 and RPB7 genes were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector PVL 1392 (Pharmingen). The RPB7ORF was first cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites in PET11a (Novagen), and RPB4 was cloned into pET15b. Each construct was digested with XbaI and BamHI, and the resulting ORF-containing fragments were subcloned between theXbaI and BamHI sites of PVL 1392. In-frame deletions in RPB7 in the PVL 1392 construct were prepared with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). After confirming each deletion by sequencing,RPB7 alleles were subcloned between the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pFasBac 1 (Invitrogen). Clones were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate recombinant baculoviruses. Rpb7 variant proteins were coexpressed with Rpb4 in Sf9 cells by coinfection with recombinant baculoviruses. 20 plates of Sf9 cells (150 × 20 mm; Nunc), each containing roughly 2 × 107 cells, were infected with 250 μl of high titer virus stock. The optimal multiplicity of infection for protein expression was determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Infected cells were scraped from plates and collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 20 min. Cell pellets were washed in 25 ml of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl to remove any remaining medium and then resuspended in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 750 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine). Resuspended cells were flash frozen and stored at −80 C. Infected cells were thawed on ice and broken by sonication (3 times for 1 min). Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The sonicate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml His-Bind resin column (Novagen) and washed with Buffer A until the eluate contained less than 10 μg of protein per ml (Bio-Rad protein assay). The His-Bind column was then washed with 10 columns of Buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole but lacking Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Cleavage to remove the hexahistidine tag was performed on the column by loading 30 μg of thrombin (Parke-Davies) in 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 5% glycerol (cleavage buffer) and incubating the column at 4 °C overnight. Thrombin was next eluted from the column by washing with 2 column volumes of cleavage buffer. The Rpb4-Rpb7 complex lacking the histidine tag was then eluted by raising the NaCl and imidazole concentrations to 500 and 50 mm, respectively (residual uncleaved His-tagged Rpb4-Rpb7 complex remained on the column and was recovered by elution with 500 mm imidazole). The cleaved (untagged) complex was diluted to 100 mm NaCl and purified further on a Mono Q column (5 × 50 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) developed with a linear gradient (10 ml) of potassium acetate (pH 7.5) from 100 mm to 1 m at 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex (identified by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled, dialyzed for 12 h against 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 400 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and concentrated in a Centricon 30 device (Amicon). Expression and purification of Rpb4-Rpb7 variant complexes were carried out exactly as described for the wild-type complex. To test for single-strand nucleic acid-binding activity, purified Rpb4-Rpb7 complex was incubated for 30 min on ice with 25 fmol of a 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide (18-mer) in 20 μl of buffer containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm potassium acetate, 10% glycerol. Bound and free probes were resolved by electrophoresis in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% glycerol and 0.5× TBE. Radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a phosphorimager (Storm). RNA binding (65-mer) was carried out under the same conditions except for the addition of 0.5 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega). For transcription assays, wild-type RNA polymerase II, TFIIF, TFIIH, and Mediator were purified from yeast whole-cell extract (13Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol.

RNA polymerase II lacking Rpb4 and Rpb7 subunits (pol IIΔ4/7) was purified from a rpb4Δ yeast strain as described (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast TBP, TFIIB, and TFIIE were purified from recombinantEscherichia coli strains (17Tijerina P. Sayre M.H. J. Biol.

Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23376-23382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gebara M.M. Sayre M.H. Corden J.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Template competition experiments employed the CYC1/G-less cassette plasmids pJJ460 and pJJ470 (20Woontner M., A., W.P. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ATP, CTP, UTP, and [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Preinitiation complexes were assembled during a 10-min incubation at 23°C in reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 7 mm magnesium acetate, 100–110 mm potassium acetate, 250 ng of plasmid DNA, 100 ng of RNA polymerase II, 30 ng of TBP, 30 ng of TFIIB, 15 ng of TFIIE, 50–100 ng each of TFIIF and TFIIH, and (where indicated) 100 ng of Mediator. Purified Rpb4-Rpb7 complex or dilution buffer was added as indicated, and transcription was initiated by adding 5 μl of a solution containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm ATP, 2.5 mm CTP, 125 μm UTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. For template competition experiments, this NTP mix (5 μl) also contained 250 ng of competitor template DNA(s) as indicated. Labeling reactions were carried out at 23°C for 15–30 min and then terminated by adding stop mix (0.2 ml) containing 0.3m NaCl and 2 units of T1 ribonuclease (Calbiochem). Radiolabeled transcripts were processed for denaturing gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography as described (21Flanagan P.M. Kelleher R.J.D. Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The sequence of the archaea Rpb7 homologue is similar to that of the ribosomal S1 domain from E. coli. The S1 protein exemplifies the OB-fold (22Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), a structure found in many other proteins with single-stranded nucleic acid-binding activity (23Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 24Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 a). The OB-fold motif consists of a 5-stranded β-sheet that is coiled to form a closed β-barrel and an α-helix that connects the third and fourth strands (Fig. 1, b and c). Some general observations about the interaction of OB-fold proteins with single-stranded nucleic acid can be gleaned from the two known structures of OB-fold/nucleic acid complexes. First, the β-strands 1–3 (Fig. 1 b,green) form a scaffold across which nucleic acid is splayed, making hydrogen bond and stacking contacts. Second, the loop between the first and second strands (L12; Fig. 1 b, red) makes key hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone. Third, the loop that connects the fourth and fifth β-strands (L45; Fig.1 b, yellow) clamps down on the nucleic acid strand, making hydrogen bond and stacking interactions. Our study had the following three goals: to purify a transcriptionally active recombinant Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, to test its nucleic acid-binding activity, and to explore its role in transcription initiation. To generate recombinant Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, subunits were first expressed individually or together in E. coli. Although both subunits accumulated to high levels in cells, they proved to be insoluble. However, a soluble complex was recovered from insect cells coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing Rpb4 and Rpb7 or from cells infected with a single recombinant baculovirus encoding both proteins. Purification of the complex from insect cell lysates was facilitated by adding a hexahistidine tag and thrombin cleavage site to the N terminus of Rpb4. The complex was immobilized on a metal affinity column and subsequently released (after extensive washing to remove unbound contaminants) by digestion of Rpb4 with thrombin. Following subsequent anion exchange chromatography, the purified complex was judged to be at least 95% homogeneous by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2), in a yield of 200 μg per liter of Sf9 cells. We designed mutant Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes containing small in-frame deletions in the predicted OB-fold of Rpb7 using information from both sequence alignments and detailed structural knowledge of OB-fold interactions with nucleic acids (Fig. 1 b). We constructed three Rpb7 mutants predicted to be compromised for ssDNA-binding (Fig.1 c). The first deletion, Rpb7Δ91–97 (D1), was predicted to disrupt β-strand 1 and part of the L12 loop. The second deletion, Rpb7Δ108–113 (D2), was predicted to disrupt β-strand 3, which harbors an aromatic residue (Phe in this case) critical for stacking interactions in all known structures. The third deletion, Rpb7Δ151–158 (D3), was predicted to disrupt the L45 loop, which contributes to stacking interactions in one structure but is less well conserved among the known OB-fold proteins. The three Rpb7 variants were coexpressed with histidine-tagged Rpb4 (Fig. 2). The structural integrity of mutant proteins was tested by monitoring the ability of each mutant to dimerize with Rpb4. The Rpb7D1 mutant was expressed but failed to copurify with Rpb4, suggesting severe mis-folding. This mutant was not analyzed further. By contrast, both the Rpb7D2 and Rpb7D3 variants formed a stable complex with Rpb4, as judged by copurification with histidine-tagged Rpb4. Moreover, the resulting mutant Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes were able to interact normally with pol IIΔ4/7 (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as judged by comigration with the polymerase on a size-exclusion column (data not shown) and by competition experiments with wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 complex (see below). To test purified wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 for single-strand nucleic acid-binding activity, we performed gel mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled ssDNA oligonucleotide probe. As predicted from its OB-fold motif, the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex bound to ssDNA in a saturable and reversible manner (Fig. 3) with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.7 μm (determined by half-maximal binding at equilibrium with protein in large molar excess). Gel mobility shift assays with an RNA oligonucleotide probe revealed similar binding to ssRNA with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.2 μm(data not shown; see Fig. 4).Figure 4RNA-binding activity of wild-type and deletion mutant (D2 and D3) Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes. A radiolabeled RNA probe was incubated with indicated amounts (micrograms) of purified Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes as described under “Experimental Procedures.ȁ Products were analyzed as for Fig.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We were unable to measure the binding activity of wild-type Rpb7 in isolation, because the protein was insoluble in the absence of Rpb4 (the same held true for N- and C-terminal Rpb7 deletion variants and for several internal deletion variants, as well). We therefore tested the Rpb4-Rpb7D2 and Rpb4-Rpb7D3 complexes on ssRNA and ssDNA to identify region(s) in Rpb7 that mediate nucleic acid binding. The Rpb7D3 mutation deleting the putative L45 loop between the predicted β-strands had no apparent effect on nucleic acid binding (Fig. 4). By contrast, the affinity of the Rpb4-Rpb7D2 complex for RNA (Fig. 4) and DNA (not shown) was at least 10-fold lower than normal. These results suggest that this part of Rpb7 may be principally responsible for the observed nucleic acid binding, as expected from structure predictions. Crude cell extract prepared from yeast lacking the RPB4 gene fails to support promoter-directed transcription, but activity can be restored by adding purified Rpb4-Rpb7 complex resolved from polymerase by ion exchange chromatography in the presence of urea (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex is required in transcription reactions reconstituted with purified components (and therefore lacking nonspecific inhibitors present in crude extracts; see Ref. 13Sayre M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23376-23382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assayed the activity of baculovirus-expressed Rpb4-Rpb7 complex with the minimal set of yeast GTFs and highly purified pol IIΔ4/7. As expected (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pol IIΔ4/7 was completely inactive in promoter-directed transcription in this well defined system. Moreover, addition of purified recombinant Rpb4-Rpb7 complex supported transcription by pol IIΔ4/7 at levels achieved by native (12-subunit) polymerase (Fig.5 a, lanes 1–4). In contrast to wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, complexes containing the Rpb7D2 or D3 mutants were completely inactive in transcription (Fig.5 a, lanes 6–11). We performed order of addition transcription experiments to test whether the D2 or D3 mutant complexes could compete with wild-type complex for stable binding to polymerase. When pol IIΔ4/7 was preincubated with wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, subsequent transcription was only slightly reduced by adding excess mutant complexes (Fig. 5 b, lanes 1–5). By contrast, when polymerase was preincubated with the D2 or D3 mutant complex first, subsequent transcription in the presence of wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 fell sharply (Fig. 5 b, lanes 6–9); when wild-type and mutant Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes were copreincubated prior to transcription, the mutant complexes inhibited RNA production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 b, lanes 10–13). Taken together with size-exclusion chromatography behavior (not shown), these results suggest that both of the mutant Rpb4-Rpb7 complexes bind normally to RNA polymerase II and can even displace wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7, as expected for reversible binding to the same site on polymerase. To test the generality of the requirement for the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, we tried transcription with several different promoters. The complex was required for initiation on the TEF1, CYC1, and AdML promoters (Fig. 5 c) regardless of DNA template topology (linear or supercoiled). As expected (25Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), addition of Mediator to the reconstituted system boosted basal transcription by pol IIΔ4/7 in the presence of wild-type Rpb4-Rpb7 complex, but it did not obviate the strict requirement for Rpb4-Rpb7 (not shown). Transcription initiation can be resolved biochemically into an ordered series of steps beginning with the assembly of a preinitiation complex and recruitment (“commitmentȁ) of polymerase to the promoter (see Refs. 26Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 27Davison B.L. Mulvihill E.R. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Previous binding studies comparing the affinity of wild-type (12-subunit) polymerase and pol IIΔ4/7 for a TBP/TFIIB complex implicated Rpb4 and/or Rpb7 in the assembly of a preinitiation complex (29Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To explore this question further in the functional context of transcription, we assessed the ability of pol IIΔ4/7 to form a stable preinitiation complex in the absence or presence of Rpb4-Rpb7. Reactions contained two otherwise identical CYC1 promoter templates encoding G-less cassette transcripts of different lengths (20Woontner M., A., W.P. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and saturating amounts of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF, as determined by factor titrations and by DNase I footprinting assays showing full TATA box occupancy by TBP under identical conditions. 2M. S. Healy, unpublished data. When pol IIΔ4/7 and the GTFs were incubated with both templates simultaneously, subsequent transcription reactions yielded equal amounts of both sets of promoter-directed transcripts (Fig.6, lanes 1 and 2). However, if pol IIΔ4/7 and GTFs were preincubated with DNA I prior to adding DNA II and NTPs, transcription ensued almost exclusively on DNA I (lane 3). No such template commitment was observed if TBP and TFIIB were omitted from the preincubation and added with DNA II (data not shown). In contrast to TBP and TFIIB, Rpb4-Rpb7 complex was not required for template commitment; the degree of commitment to DNA I was identical regardless of whether the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex was present in the preincubation step (compare lanes 3 and4). These results indicate that polymerase can join a stable, active preinitiation complex in the absence of Rpb4 and Rpb7 and therefore suggest that the essential function of the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex (Fig. 5 a) comes after polymerase binds to the promoter. In this study we focused on the nucleic acid-binding activity of the yeast Rpb4-Rpb7 complex and on its role in transcription initiation. Our results show that the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex binds fairly strongly to ssDNA and RNA in vitro, as predicted from the sequence and structural homology of the OB-fold motif of Rpb7 to the S1 domain (22Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J.P. Proctor M. Freund S.M.V. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Langer D. Lottspeich F. Zillig W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 694Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The complex binds RNA and DNA with nearly equal affinity, and a mutation in the putative OB-fold abrogates binding to both substrates, indicating a common site for interaction. Because the OB-fold occurs in both RNA- and DNA-binding proteins, and the two types of interaction seem structurally indistinguishable, the physiological substrate remains to be determined. The Rpb4-Rpb7D2 complex bearing a deletion in β-strand 3 of the putative OB-fold DNA-binding surface (Fig. 1) was indeed defective in nucleic acid binding and moreover was completely devoid of transcription activity, raising the possibility that nucleic acid binding is key to the function of the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex. However, the Rpb7 D3 deletion disrupting the putative L45 loop (Fig. 1) was also completely inactive in transcription, even though it retained nucleic acid-binding activity. Our sequence alignment may not accurately predict the exact boundaries of the putative OB-fold, and the D3 deletion may lie outside the critical DNA-binding surfaces. Even if the alignment is correct, the L45 loop in Rpb7 may simply be less important for stabilizing nucleic acid interactions compared with other OB-folds. In any case, this portion of Rpb7 evidently has a key role in transcription distinct from DNA binding. Indeed, the ssDNA-binding activity of the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex may be peripheral to transcription activity, and the deleterious effect of the D2 mutation on both activities may be coincidental. Further genetic, biochemical, and structural studies are needed to fully delineate the role of the OB-fold motif of Rpb7 in DNA/RNA-binding and transcription. The C25 subunit of RNA polymerase III appears to be a Rpb7 homologue (31Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6164-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether this subunit also possesses nucleic acid-binding activity and if so, whether it is important for transcription initiation on class III promoters. Endogenous pol IIΔ4/7 was incapable of promoter utilization in a crude extract unless supplied with purified Rpb4-Rpb7 complex or (alternatively) Gal4-VP16, a potent transcription activator (5Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract provided GTFs and Mediator, as well as pol IIΔ4/7, and likely contained Rpb7, as well (Rpb7 is essential for yeast viability). Thus, our previous experiments did not rule out a role for Rpb7 in activated transcription. Results reported here confirm that the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex is indeed required for basal transcription in a completely defined reconstituted system. We also find that the complex is required for transcription in the presence of Mediator, indicating an important role for the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex in transcription by RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (16Myers L.C.

Further work is needed to explore the role of Rpb7 in activation by enhancer-binding proteins. The defining biological feature of ς factors is their capacity to confer promoter class specificity on polymerase and thereby orchestrate multigene transcription programs for cellular development and responses to stress (reviewed in Ref. 33Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The real test to see whether yeast Rpb4-Rpb7 complex plays a similar role will come from whole-genome analysis with suitable mutants (e.g. see Ref. 34Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Reconstructions of yeast RNA polymerase II structures from electron micrographs place the Rpb4-Rpb7 complex in the putative DNA-binding cleft of the polymerase and suggest that the complex favors a closed conformation of the polymerase “armȁ domain around the cleft (29Jensen G.J. Meredith G. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that Rpb4-Rpb7 may stabilize polymerase binding by contacting DNA in the cleft and somehow coupling DNA entry to closure of the cleft. It is tempting to speculate that the Rpb7D2 mutation may disrupt the DNA “sensor,ȁ whereas the D3 mutation may disrupt protein-protein interactions that transduce the DNA signal to the polymerase arm domain. A more detailed structural model of polymerase bound to DNA places Rpb4-Rpb7 downstream of the catalytic site in the cleft (35Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and because our biochemical findings indicate that Rpb4-Rpb7 complex mediates a step following template commitment, we speculate that it may stabilize the open promoter complex prior to initiation and/or an early transcribing complex prior to promoter escape, perhaps by binding to ssDNA in the transcript “bubbleȁ (in analogy to bacterial ς factors) or to nascent RNA. Sorting this out will require further biochemical studies using cross-linking, permangenate footprinting, and kinetic measurements along the lines used for analyzing mammalian systems (36Lagrange T.

Besides physical interactions between CCR4, CAF1, and NOT proteins, there is also a functional association. Mutations in theNOT, CCR4, and CAF1 genes lead to similar, but not identical, phenotypes (1Liu H.Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L.

Interestingly, mutations in NOT1, NOT3, NOT5, andCAF1 genes suppressed a mutation in SRB4, which is an essential component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and required for the expression of most protein-coding genes. This suggests that the yeast CCR4·NOT complex has a very general role in RNA polymerase II transcription (15Lee T.I. Wyrich J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Godbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). cDNAs for four subunits, hNOT2,1 hNOT3, hNOT4, and human CALIF (CAF1-like factor), were isolated and characterized. Like yeast NOT4, hNOT4 interacts with yeast NOT1 and an N-terminally truncated hNOT1 protein, and hNOT4 complements a not4-null mutation in yeast (16Albert T.K. Lemaire M. Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Human NOT4 contains two protein motifs in its N-terminal region, a RING finger and an RNA recognition motif (16Albert T.K. Lemaire M. Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the protein is evolutionarily conserved, in contrast to the C-terminal part (16Albert T.K. Lemaire M. Berkum N.L. Gentz R. Collart M.A. Timmers H.T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The RNA recognition motif has been implicated in binding of single-stranded nucleic acids (reviewed in Ref. 17Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem.

Recently, an increasing amount of data showed that several RING finger-containing proteins function as E3 ubiquitin ligases, which target proteins for degradation (reviewed in Ref. 21Freemont P.S.

The RING finger motif can be defined by the consensus sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X9–39-Cys-X1–3-His-X2–3-(Cys/His)-X2-Cys-X4–48-Cys-X2-Cys, in which X can be any amino acid. It binds two zinc atoms using its cysteine and histidine residues (reviewed in Refs. 18Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct.

By primary sequence comparison, RING finger variants have been identified in which the zinc-coordinating ligands have been replaced with other residues (25Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Borden K.L.

The solution structures of the immediate-early EHV-1 protein from equine herpesvirus (IEEHV) and the acute promyelocytic leukemia proto-oncogene product (PML) have been solved by NMR methods (28Barlow P.N.

Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of the immunoglobulin gene recombination enzyme RAG1 (30Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the c-Cbl RING finger bound to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 (31Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) have been solved by x-ray diffraction. The RING finger structures of RAG1 and IEEHV are remarkably similar, but differ considerably from the PML RING finger structure. Despite this, all C3HC4structures possess some common features, the most obvious being the coordination of the two zinc atoms in a cross-brace configuration. In this system, Cys1, Cys2, Cys5, and Cys6 coordinate the first zinc atom, and Cys3, His1, Cys7, and Cys8 share the second zinc atom. The inter-zinc distance in all three structures is 14 Å. The consensus sequence for the RING finger of NOT4 orthologs is Cys-X2-Cys-X13-Cys-X-Cys-X4-Cys-X2-Cys-X11–16-Cys-X2-Cys. It constitutes a novel RING finger variant of a C4C4 type in which His1 is replaced with cysteine. Also, the spacing between the fourth and fifth metal-coordinating residues is different. To investigate whether this motif in NOT4 can adopt a RING finger conformation, we determined its structure by NMR methods. We found that the overall fold of the NOT4 RING finger resembles that of the C3HC4 RING fingers. However, important differences especially in the secondary structure elements are notable. pET15b-hNOT4-N78 encodes the first 78 amino acids of hNOT4 N-terminally fused to a 23-residue His6 tag. The hNOT4-N78 insert was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using pET15b-hNOT4-N227 as a template, a T7 primer (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′), and a hNOT4-specific primer (5′-GCGGGATCCTATATCCTTTGCAGCTCTTCCTG-3′). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with XhoI andBamHI and ligated into pET15b (Novagen) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The DNA sequence of this fragment was verified by sequence analysis using an automated ABI310 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) bacteria containing the pET15b-hNOT4-N78 plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 0.4β glucose at 37 °C and induced atA600 = 0.75 with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 10 μm ZnCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. After harvesting, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 20β sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μmZnCl2, 1 mm imidazole, 0.1β Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, followed by one freeze-thaw cycle to lyse the cells. After addition of KCl to 300 mm, the lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 250,000 × g. The cleared lysate was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (QIAGEN Inc.) equilibrated in lysis buffer containing 300 mm KCl. After washing the column with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10β glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 20 μmZnCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 1 and 16 mm imidazole, protein was eluted in buffer A using a linear gradient from 16 to 400 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium bisulfite, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 100 mm KCl (buffer B100) and applied to a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer B100. After washing with buffer B100, the column was developed using a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm KCl. hNOT4-N78 eluted from the column at ∼170 mm KCl and was purified to homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of protein gels. hNOT4-N78 was concentrated using a Centricon spin dialysis tube (10-kDa cutoff; Amicon, Inc.). To overexpress 15N-labeled,15N/13C-labeled, and 15N/10β13C-labeled hNOT4-N78, bacteria were grown in synthetic medium (6.0 g/liter Na2HPO4·2H2O, 3.0 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 μmCaCl2, 36 nmFeSO4·7H2O, 20 μmZnCl2, and 5 mg/liter thiamine) containing 0.5 g/liter15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and either 4.0 g/liter [12C]glucose or 2.5 g/liter [13C]glucose or a mixture of 2.25 g/liter [12C]glucose and 0.25 g/liter [13C]glucose as the only carbon source. Induction took place atA600 = 0.7–0.75, and proteins were purified as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assays employing bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Protein yields ranged between 10 and 15 mg/liter of bacterial culture. NMR experiments were carried out at 300 K and pH 7.0 on a Bruker DRX600 apparatus equipped with a triple-resonance z-gradient probe, unless indicated otherwise.

Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 113Cd-1H HSQC spectra were recorded using a broadband z-gradient probe. The delays for magnetization transfer were set to 6, 9, and 12 ms. Twenty t1increments of 1000 scans were recorded. The 113Cd chemical shifts are reported relative to 1 m CdSO4. NOE distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOE, three-dimensional NOESY-(15N,1H)-HSQC, and three-dimensional NOESY-(13C,1H)-HSQC spectra with mixing times of 50 and 150 ms. NOE cross-peaks were classified as strong (1.8–2.7 Å), medium (1.8–3.5 Å), weak (1.8–5.0 Å), and very weak (1.8–6.0 Å) using secondary structure elements for calibration. All NMR spectra were processed using the NMRpipe package (38Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program REGINE (39Kleywegt G.J. Vuister G.W. Padilla A. Knegtel R.M.A. Boelens R. Kaptein R. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1993; 102: 166-176Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed with the program X-PLOR (40Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 229: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 41Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). To correct for multiple atom selection, we used the sum averaging option as implemented in X-PLOR. Distance restraints containing diastereotopic groups were corrected as described by Fletcher et al. (42Fletcher C.M. Jones D.N. Diamond R. Neuhaus D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 292-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The structures were calculated using the distance geometry protocol, which is followed by a simulated annealing and refinement protocol using standard parameters. Until this stage, information about the zinc coordination was not included. Then, the constraints between metal ligands (3.6 Å < Sγ(Cys)–Sγ(Cys) < 3.9 Å) were added to the restraints list, and an additional refinement protocol was performed. The zinc atoms were added at the average position of four metal-ligating atoms. Thereafter, the geometric restraints to the zinc atoms were added, and additional refinement was performed. The geometric restraints are as follows: bond lengths for Zn–Sγ(Cys) are 2.3 Å and geminal bond angles of Sγ(Cys)–Zn–Sγ(Cys) and Zn–Sγ(Cys)–Cβ(Cys) are 109.5° (43Neuhaus D. Nakaseko Y. Schwabe J.W.R. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The final set of structures was analyzed using the program PROCHECK-NMR (44Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A. MacArther M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot of Fig. 4 was produced with the program PROCHECK-NMR (44Laskowski R.A. Rullman J.A. MacArther M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Molecular figures were prepared using the program MOLMOL (45Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The first 78 residues of hNOT4, which contain the C4C4 RING finger, were fused to an N-terminal His6 tag. This protein was overexpressed and 15N- and 15N/13C-isotopically labeled in bacteria and purified to homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The sequence of the first 78 residues of hNOT4 is shown in Fig. 1 and is compared with the corresponding region in yeast NOT4 and with the C3HC4 RING fingers of IEEHV and RAG1. Sequence-specific assignments were obtained by the analysis of three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH and three-dimensional HNCACB spectra and by the application of a three-dimensional CDCA(NCO)CAHA spectrum (33Bottomley M.J. Macias M.M. Liu Z. Sattler M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for 11 proline residues. The assignments for 10 residues of the 23-residue His6-tagged region were also obtained.1H-15N correlations for the remaining residues in the His6-tagged region were not observed, and the resonances for those residues were therefore left unassigned. Stereospecific assignments for methyl protons in the prochiral center of Val12, Leu16, Leu21, and Leu52 were obtained. In addition to this, 14 out of 64 β-methylene protons were also obtained. To determine the number of metal ions present in the hNOT4 RING finger and the coordination system, we performed 113Cd-1H HSQC experiments using hNOT4-N78 in which the zinc ions were replaced with cadmium ions.113Cd-substituted hNOT4-N78 was obtained by adding113Cd- EDTA to a final concentration of 4 mm to zinc-containing hNOT4-N78, and the exchange of zinc with 113Cd was monitored using1H-15N HSQC spectra. Since most of the resonances were shifted by the substitution, the assignments of 1H and 15N resonances of113Cd-hNOT4-N78 had to be confirmed by three-dimensional NOESY-(1H,15N)-HSQC and three-dimensional TOCSY-(1H,15N)-HSQC spectra. Fig.2 A shows the chemical shift differences between 113Cd-hNOT4-N78 and Zn-hNOT4-N78. Cys17, Cys33, and Cys56 displayed the largest differences in both the 1H and 15N chemical shifts, which is correlated with hydrogen bonding from amide protons to the sulfur atoms of the zinc cluster (see below). Residues other than cysteines displayed only a slight change in chemical shifts, showing that exchange took place without breaking the integrity of the whole structure. Fig. 2 B shows the two-dimensional113Cd-1H HSQC spectrum of113Cd-hNOT4-N78 displaying the correlation between two cadmium resonances and the 1H chemical shifts belonging to the β protons of the coordinating cysteine residues. The observed chemical shift values of cadmium resonances, 687.5 and 714.4 ppm, are both typical for cadmium(II) coordinated by four sulfur ligands. The113Cd-1H HSQC spectrum shows that Cys14, Cys17, Cys38, and Cys41 (site 1) share one metal ion that resonates at 687.5 ppm and that Cys33, Cys53, and Cys56 (site 2) share the other metal ion at 714.4 ppm. The correlation of the remaining Cys31 was not observed in any of the 113Cd-1H HSQC spectra with magnetization delays of 6, 9, and 12 ms. However, the last metal-coordinating ligand of site 2 was assigned to Cys31 since the resonance value for this metal is characteristic for cadmium(II) coordinated by four sulfur atoms. These results show that the NOT4 RING finger contains two zinc ions, which are ligated in a cross-brace manner, similar to the canonical RING fingers. The three-dimensional structure was determined for the zinc-containing form of hNOT4-N78. In total, 397 distance restraints (20 intraresidue, 171 sequential, 74 medium-range, and 132 long-range) and 32 angle constraints (19 φ and 13 χ1) obtained from various two- and three-dimensional spectra were used for the structure calculations. Four hydrogen bond restraints, which were identified in a long-range HNCO spectrum, were also included. Finally, 200 structures were calculated, and 30 structures with a low energy were selected. Fig.3 A shows the superposition of the backbone atoms of these 30 calculated structures, and a summary of structural statistics is given in Table Iand Fig. 3 (B–D). The region between residues 12 and 61 is well structured, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts are disordered due to lack of NOEs. Root mean square deviation values in the structured region versus the mean coordinates are 0.58 ± 0.13 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.08 ± 0.12 Å for all heavy atoms.Table IStructural statistics of hNOT4-N78r.m.s.1-ar.m.s., root mean square.deviation from experimental distance restraintsAll NOE(Å)0.017±0.002Dihedral angle (°)0.328 ± 0.076r.m.s. deviation versusaverage structures (Å)Backbone (N, C-α, C′)0.58 ± 0.13All heavy atoms1.08 ± 0.12Deviation from idealized geometryBond (Å)0.0029 ± 0.0003Angle (°)0.904 ± 0.015Improper (°)0.422 ± 0.006Residues in allowed ϕ/ψ regions of the Ramachandran plot (β)Most favored region62.5Additionally allowed region34.3Generously allowed region2.9Disallowed regions0.31-a r.m.s., root mean square. Open table in a new tab The structure of hNOT4-N78 consists of three long loops, L1 (residues 12–22), L2 (residues 27–38), and L3 (residues 49–61), and an α-helix (residues 39–48) between the second and third loops. Of the 8 cysteine residues that are involved in zinc coordination, the first (Cys14, Cys17), second (Cys31, Cys33), and forth (Cys53, Cys56) pairs are located in L1, L2, and L3, respectively. The remaining 2 cysteines (Cys38, Cys41) are located at the end of L2 and in the α-helix. Region 23–26 is recognized as a helical turn in 15 out of 30 calculated structures using secondary structure analysis in PROCHECK-NMR. All proline residues were found to have atrans-configuration on the basis of the observation of NOEs between the αi−1 and δiprotons. The three loops are stabilized by the coordination with the zinc ions and by hydrophobic interactions. Leu16 in L1 and Pro54 in L3 form a hydrophobic area with Ile37in L2 and Ile45 belonging to the α-helix. The conformations of both L1 and L3 are remarkably similar. Val12–Pro20 can be superimposed on Gly51–Tyr60 with a root mean square deviation of 0.18 Å versus the mean coordinates. Consistent with this, hydrogen bonds were also identified for CO(Val12)–NH(Leu21) in L1 and CO(Gly51)–NH(Tyr60) in L3 on the basis of hydrogen bond J-couplings (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) in a long-range HNCO spectrum. The Ramachandran plot for residues 12–61 of the 30 calculated structures is shown in Fig.4 A. In addition to Gly34 and Gly51, Met18 in L1 and Arg57 in L3 also have positive φ angles in all 30 structures, although their ψ angles were not refined well. These positive φ angles of Met18 and Arg57 were confirmed by observation of cross-correlated relaxation of HN–N and HN–H-α dipolar interactions of the multiple lines (47Crowley P. Ubbink M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2968-2969Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For this, we measured the intensity ratio of the 15N-coupled amide proton resonances in 15N-labeled hNOT4-N78. Fig.4 B shows the NH multiplets of these residues together with those of Glu49 and Leu52, which have negative φ angles. For Met18 and Arg57, the peak heights of the inner two multiplet components were lower than those of the outer two multiplets. The distance between the two zinc atoms is 14.9 ± 0.3 Å, which is slightly longer than the well conserved value of 14 Å as found in the C3HC4 RING finger structures of PML (29Bordon K.L. Boddy M.N. Lally J. O'Reilly N.J. Martin S. Howe K. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1532-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), IEEHV (28Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. Elliott M. Everett R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), RAG1 (30Bellon S.F. Rodgers K.K. Schatz D.G. Coleman J.E. Steitz T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and Cbl (31Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). This could be due to the fact that there is a 4-residue spacing between Cys33 and Cys38 in hNOT4-N78, whereas only 2 residues separate the same zinc-ligating residues in the other three C3HC4 RING fingers. Several NH protons surrounding the metal atoms display large upfield shifts in the amide proton resonance positions upon exchanging zinc with cadmium, as shown in Fig. 2 A. These protons were found within a short distance of the sulfur atoms of the cysteines involved in metal ligation in 30 structures. For example, the distances between NH and the sulfur atom are 2.90 ± 0.25 Å for NH(Cys17)–S(Cys14), 2.94 ± 0.38 Å for NH(Cys33)–S(Cys31), 2.55 ± 0.08 Å for NH(Cys56)–S(Cys53), 2.45 ± 0.06 Å for NH(Cys38)–S(Cys14), and 2.54 ± 0.31 Å for NH(Cys41)–S(Cys38). The chemical shift of the amide proton is sensitive to hydrogen bond length (37Cordier F. Grzesiek S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1601-1602Crossref Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and substitution of zinc with cadmium causes a small change in hydrogen bond length due to the increase in the metal–sulfur bond length (48Goodfellow B.J. Rusnak F. Moura I. Domke T. Moura J.J.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 928-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,49Ayhan M. Xiao Z. Lavery M.J. Hamer A.M. Nugent K.W. Scrofani S.D.B. Guss M. Wedd A.G. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 5902-5911Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is likely that these observed large chemical shift changes upon exchanging zinc with cadmium reflect the presence of hydrogen bonds from NH protons to sulfur atoms. These hydrogen bonds could contribute to stabilize the coordination of the zinc ion. Fig. 5 shows a schematic drawing of the RING finger structures of hNOT4-N78, IEEHV, and RAG1. The α-helix in hNOT4-N78 is well conserved in IEEHV and RAG1. However, the β-sheet that exists in both IEEHV and RAG1 is not present in hNOT4-N78. The region corresponding to the third strand of the β-sheet in IEEHV, which is absent in RAG1, is unstructured in hNOT4-N78. The region corresponding to the first and second β-strands adopts a loop conformation in hNOT4-N78. Although these regions have a different conformation in hNOT4-N78 and the other two RING fingers, they are located in a similar position and have a similar orientation. The root mean square deviation values of C-α atoms between the mean coordinates of the C4C4 RING finger and C3HC4 RING finger structures are 1.7 Å for IEEHV (45 C-α atoms; Protein Data Bank code 1CHC), 1.6 Å for RAG1 (45 C-α atoms; Protein Data Bank code 1RMD), and 1.8 Å for c-Cbl (45 C-α atoms; Protein Data Bank code 1FBV). Despite the differences in secondary structural elements, the overall structure of hNOT4-N78 is quite similar to the structures of IEEHV, RAG1, and c-Cbl. In the hydrophobic region of the C3HC4 RING finger, 2 central residues are well conserved (Phe28 and Ile33 in IEEHV, Phe309 and Ile314in RAG1, and Met400 and Leu405 in c-Cbl). In hNOT4-N78, the backbone atoms of Ile37 and Trp42 are located in a similar position in space. The orientation of the side chains, however, is slightly different. The side chain of Ile37 is still positioned in the core, similar to the conserved Phe28 of IEEHV and Phe309 of RAG1; but the side chain of Trp42 is pointing away from Ile37, although they have limited contact. Instead, the side chain of Ile45 is pointing toward the side chain of Ile37 and participating in the hydrophobic core, taking over the role of Trp42. Consistent with this, Ile45 is invariant in all known NOT4 orthologs to date (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Recently, the crystal structure of the c-Cbl RING finger bound to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 has been reported (31Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The UbcH7-binding site on the c-Cbl RING finger is provided by the shallow groove formed by the α-helix and two zinc-chelating loops. It is interesting to note that this region is well conserved with the hNOT4 C4C4 RING finger in structural but not chemical terms. Also, hNOT4 has a shallow groove that is formed by Leu16 in L1; Pro54 in L3; and Arg44, Ile45, and Glu49 in the α-helix. Although L1 and L3 come close to each other, there is a groove between the two loops and the α-helix. It is important to note that although the structure is conserved, the side chains are not. Ile383, Ser407, Trp408, and Ser411, which form the binding site for UbcH7 in the c-Cbl RING, are replaced by Leu16, Arg44, Ile45, and Asp48, respectively, in hNOT4. So far, the exact role of the hNOT4 RING finger domain in the CCR4·NOT complex is unclear. Yeast complementation analysis showed that unlike full-length hNOT4, a hNOT4 protein lacking the RING finger motif does not complement its yeast counterpart. 2M. J. de Ruwe, F. A. J. van den Heuvel, M. A. Collart, and H. T. M. Timmers, unpublished observation. Surprisingly, the RING finger domain of hNOT4 is not required for interaction with hNOT1, as this is mediated by the nonconserved C-terminal part of hNOT4 (data not shown). Analogous to the RING finger of c-Cbl (22Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar,31Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), the hNOT4 RING finger may serve in a role as a E3 ligase in (poly)ubiquitination of proteins. In accordance with this proposal, we have identified in yeast two-hybrid screens components of the ubiquitin pathway as NOT4 RING interaction partners. 3T. K. Albert, F. A. J. van den Heuvel, Y. I. A. Legtenberg, and H. T. M. Timmers, unpublished observation. The structure of the NOT4 RING finger displays the features that were observed in the Cbl-UbcH7 interaction. The described structure of the NOT4 C4C4 RING finger allows the rational design of phenotypic mutations that affect these interactions and subsequent testing of the effects on the in vivo function of NOT4. This should provide a better understanding of transcription regulation by the CCR4·NOT complex."

Proteoglycans have different functions. They are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissue, are involved in cell adhesion and motility, in cell differentiation and morphogenesis, and may also be responsible, in part, for the nonthrombogenic properties of the vascular endothelium. Both heparan sulfate proteoglycans, present in the membrane of endothelial cells, and thrombomodulin, a chondroitin sulfate-containing proteoglycan, have been implicated in procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms (1Marcum J.A.

Several comparisons of amino acid sequences of known glycosaminoglycan attachment sites in different proteins resulted in a recognition sequence composed of the amino acids a-a-a-a-G-S-G-a-b-a, with a = E or D and b = G, E, or D (5Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The highest sensitivity for XT activity in a radiochemical test was reached using a protein acceptor containing this recognition sequence. This was confirmed by the determination of Michaelis-Menten (K m) constants for in vitro xylosylation of different proteins and synthetic peptides in comparison to silk, which was formerly used. The use of recombinant bikunin, which contains the recognition sequence as acceptor, enables an accurate and precise determination of XT activity even in serum. Bikunin is the inhibitory component of the human inter-α-trypsin inhibitor and a natural core protein which is quantitatively modified by one chondroitin sulfate chain. In contrast to almost all other glycosyltransferases the XT is secreted into the extracellular space (6Götting C. Kuhn J. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Prot.

Reinards R. Okusi J. Wolf B. Greiling H.J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar). The elevation of enzyme activity in synovial fluids indicates the increased synthesis of proteoglycans in inflammatory processes. Increased XT activities were also determined in the serum of patients with systemic sclerosis, closely related to an elevated proteoglycan biosynthesis. These results demonstrate the validity of XT as a diagnostic marker for the determination of sclerotic activity in systemic sclerosis (11Götting C. Sollberg S. Kuhn J. Weilke C. Huerkamp C.

Isolation of XT has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining a sufficient amount of the source materials. Therefore, we developed a method to produce a protein solution containing high XT activity but low protein concentration by serum-free cultivation of JAR choriocarcinoma cells using hollow fiber bioreactor technology. Using this material we isolated an unknown protein in trace amounts and sequenced 11 peptides from the enzymatically cleaved protein. The amino acid sequences from the 11 peptides are a basic requirement for molecular cloning and expression of XT. Human JAR choriocarcinoma cells were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD).

The MALDI mass spectrometer Reflex II was from Bruker Daltonik GmbH (Bremen, Germany) and protein sequencer Procise 494 cLC was purchased from PE Biosystems (Framingham, MA). Precast polyacrylamide gels, buffers, and NuPAGE electrophoresis system XCell II Mini-Cell and Blot Module were from Novex (San Diego, CA). The synthetic peptide CSRQKELLKRKLEQQEK and the rabbit antiserum were purchased from BioScience (Göttingen, Germany). Peroxidase-conjugated affinipure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) was purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). N-Glycosidase F was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). JAR choriocarcinoma cells releasing XT in the cell culture supernatant were cultured in Ultradoma-PF medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After incubation for 24 h in the serum-containing medium, the cell cultivation was adapted to serum-free conditions as described previously (6Götting C. Kuhn J. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. J. Prot. Chem. 1998; 17: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Scaling up of XT production was carried out in three hybrid hollow-fiber bioreactors TECNOMOUSE. During the exponential growth the cells from three 175 cm2 T-flasks (>3 × 107 cells) were detached with 0.5% trypsin and 0.2% EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation (5 min, 1000 × g) of the cell suspension the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 37 °C warm serum-free and protein-free Ultradoma-PF medium and washed three times with 20 ml of the same medium. The cell suspension was drawn into a 10-ml syringe and then inoculated into the extracapillary space (EC space) of the reactor. The bioreactor was connected with a 2-liter medium bottle and set to 150 ml/h in the recirculation mode, and the oxygenation pump was set as described in the operating manual. Five days after inoculation a 10-ml syringe was connected to the left hand EC port and 10 ml of cell culture supernatant was harvested from the EC space. The harvesting was continued every 2 days over a period of 3 months. Glucose and lactate concentration of the cell culture supernatant were controlled using the Super G analyzer and the ACA analyzer, respectively. The 2-liter medium bottle was replaced every 3 days. The viability of the cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Protamine chloride was immobilized as ligand on POROS 20 AL. 30 mg of ligand was dissolved in 10 ml of 10 mmphosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. After the protein had been dissolved, 5 ml of 100 mm phosphate, 1.50m NaCl, pH 7.4, was added. NaCNBH3 was dissolved in the ligand/buffer solution to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and 1.0 g of POROS 20 AL was suspended in the same solution. The suspension was mixed gently on a shaker for 1 min at room temperature. An additional 2 ml of 100 mm phosphate, 1.50m NaCl, pH 7.4, was added to the suspension and the mixture was shaken continuously. This step was repeated every 5 min until the mixture volume was 25 ml. After additional shaking for 2 h, the medium was filtered on a sintered glass funnel. The matrix was suspended in 20 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, 5 g/liter NaCNBH3, pH 7.2, and mixed gently on a shaker for 30 min at room temperature. After the media had been washed in a sintered glass funnel using 100 ml of 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 ml of 1.0 m NaCl, and another 100 ml of 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.4, the matrix was packed in a PEEK column (4.6 × 50 mm). Aprotinin affinity matrix was synthesized according to the synthesis of the protamine affinity matrix, but using aprotinin as ligand. After immobilization of the ligand the matrix was packed in a PEEK column (4.6 × 50 mm). Fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography steps were performed at room temperature, ultrafiltration and diafiltration were carried out at 4 °C. 18.5 liters of JAR cell culture supernatant collected from three hybrid hollow-fiber bioreactors, TECNOMOUSE, each containing 5 culture cassettes, was concentrated to 800 ml with ultrafiltration cells using YM1 cellulose membranes. The retentate was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was discarded. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 28% saturation. After 1 h at room temperature the suspension was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 h, the supernatant was decanted, and the precipitate was removed. Additional ammonium sulfate was added to the solution to the point of 40% saturation, and the suspension was allowed to stand for 1 h. To recover the precipitate the supernatant was decanted after the suspension was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2 h. Before chromatography on immobilized heparin the precipitate was dissolved in 460 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0). The step 1 product was passed through a 0.2-μm filter. 4.0 ml of the filtrate was applied to a POROS 20 HE2 column (16 × 100 mm) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. After washing the column with 100 ml of buffer A the XT activity was eluted with the same buffer containing NaCl. The NaCl concentration was increased stepwise: 20 ml of buffer A, 0.09 m NaCl; 20 ml of buffer A, 0.15 m NaCl; 30 ml of buffer A, 0.24 m NaCl; 24 ml of buffer A, 0.30 m NaCl; 24 ml of buffer A, 0.60m NaCl; 24 ml of buffer A, 1.00 m NaCl; and 24 ml of buffer A, 1.89 m NaCl. Fractions of 38 ml each were collected and the XT activity was measured. The procedure was repeated 115 times by cyclic chromatography and the fractions containing XT activity (115 × 38 ml) were collected. Collected fractions from step 2 were desalted using diafiltration with YM1 cellulose membranes and ultrafiltration cells. After concentration of the desalted protein solution to 0.05 liter using analogous techniques the XT-enriched solution was subjected to ion exchange chromatography. 4.0 ml of the XT solution was applied onto the POROS 20 HQ column (16 × 100 mm) previously equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The column was washed with 80 ml of buffer A, and the adsorbed protein was eluted stepwise using the same buffer containing 0.07 m NaCl (88 ml), 0.18m NaCl (120 ml), and 0.36 m NaCl (120 ml) followed by a linear gradient of 0.36–1.00 m NaCl (200 ml) and another step of buffer A, 2.0 m NaCl (120 ml). 50-ml fractions were collected and assayed for activity and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Chromatography was repeated 13 times, and the fractions exhibiting XT activity (13 × 50 ml) were collected for affinity chromatography. XT-containing solution from step 3 was desalted as described above and concentrated to 5 ml by ultrafiltration with YM1 cellulose membranes. The ultrafiltration product was passed through a 0.2-μm filter. 100 μl of the filtrate was loaded onto a protamine chloride-POROS column (4.6 × 50 mm) equilibrated with buffer A. The flow rate was 10 ml/min. The column was washed with 10.0 ml of buffer A, and the adsorbed fraction was eluted with the same buffer containing NaCl by a stepwise increase of the NaCl concentration: 6.6 ml of buffer A, 0.04 m NaCl; 6.6 ml of buffer A, 0,06m NaCl; 6.6 ml of buffer A, 0.23 m NaCl followed by a linear gradient of 0.23–1.20 m NaCl (4.2 ml) in buffer A. Fractions of 6.0 ml were collected, assayed for XT activity, and evaluated by SDS-PAGE. Cyclic chromatography was repeated 50 times. The purified enzyme was collected, concentrated to 1.0 ml using ultrafiltration techniques and stored at −75 °C. The protein composition of various fractions was estimated by SDS-PAGE. Briefly, 12.1 μl of sample was added to 4.7 μl of sample buffer (1.00 m Tris-HCl, 1.17m sucrose, 0.28 m SDS, 2.08 mmEDTA, 0.88 mm Serva Blue G250, 0.70 mm phenol red, 0.10 m dithiothreitol, pH 8.5) and heated for 10 min at 99 °C. After the sample had been loaded, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 4–12% bis-tris polyacrylamide gel with MOPS running buffer (1.00 m MOPS, Tris, 69.3 mm SDS, 20.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.7). Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining. The Coomassie bands were excised and characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analysis. Coomassie-stained proteins were excised from the gel, repeatedly washed with H2O and H2O/acetonitrile, and digested overnight with trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C at 37 °C. The peptides generated in the supernatant were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Sample preparation was achieved following the thin film preparation techniques (13Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 0.3 μl of a nitrocellulose containing saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in acetone were deposited onto individual spots on the target. Subsequently, 0.8 μl of 10% formic acid and 0.4 μl of the digest sample was loaded on top of the thin film spots and allowed to dry slowly at ambient temperature. To remove salts from the digestion buffer the spots were washed with 10% formic acid and with H2O. MALDI mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode with delayed extraction on a Reflex II time-of-flight instrument equipped with a SCOUT multiprobe inlet and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Ion acceleration voltage was set to 20.0 kV, the reflector voltage was set to 21.5 kV and the first extraction plate was set to 15.4 kV. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging 50–200 individual laser shots. Calibration of the spectra was performed internally by a two-point linear fit using the autolysis products of trypsin at m/z 842.50 and 2211.10. The 120-kDa Coomassie-stained protein was excised from the gel, repeatedly washed with H2O and H2O/acetonitrile, and digested with trypsin and endoproteinase Lys-C overnight. For HPLC separation the excised gel fragment was extracted twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile. The extracted enzymatic fragments were separated on a capillary HPLC system equipped with a 140B solvents delivery system (PE Biosystems), Acurate splitter (LC-Packings), UV absorbance detector 759A (PE Biosystems), U-Z capillary flow cell (LC-Packings), and Probot fraction collector (BAI) using a reversed-phase column (Hypersil C18 BDS, 3 μm, 0.3 × 150 mm) and a linear gradient from 12% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 64% acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 90 min with a flow rate of 4 μl/min at room temperature. Peptide elution was monitored at 214 nm and individual fractions from the HPLC separation were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Sequence analysis of separated fragments was performed on a Procise Protein Sequencer 494 cLC using standard programs supplied by PE Biosystems. Determination of XT activity is based on the incorporation of [14C]d-xylose into the recombinant bikunin according to a previously described method (14Weilke C. Brinkmann T. Kleesiek K. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (100 μl) for the assay contained 50 μl of XT solution, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm KF, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 1.0 μmUDP-[14C]d-xylose, and 1.5 μmrecombinant bikunin. Following incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction mixtures were placed on nitrocellulose discs. After drying, the discs were washed once for 10 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid and three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The enzyme activity was expressed in units (1 unit = 1 μmol of incorporated xylose per min). The synthetic peptide CSRQKELLKRKLEQQEK deduced from the sequenced peptides 2 and 10 of the enzymatically cleaved XT was synthesized, purified by HPLC, and used for immunization of rabbits (BioScience, Germany). Polyclonal antiserum was obtained by injection of the above antigen followed by booster injections at 3-week intervals, 4 times in total, into Charles rabbits. The antigen CSRQKELLKRKLEQQEK was immobilized on POROS 20 EP. After 1.6 mg of antigen was dissolved in 1.2 ml of 10 mmphosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.60 ml of 100 mm phosphate, 1.50 m NaCl, pH 7.4, was added. 400 mg of POROS 20 EP was suspended in the solution and the suspension was mixed gently on a shaker at room temperature. At 10-min intervals, five times in total, an additional 0.24 ml of 100 mmphosphate, 1.50 m NaCl, pH 7.4, was added to the suspension. After additional shaking for 5 days at room temperature the suspension was filtered on a sintered glass funnel. The matrix was suspended in 4 ml of 0.2 m phosphate, 0.1 m2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4, and mixed on a shaker for 2 h at room temperature. The matrix was washed in a sintered glass funnel using 20 ml of 10 mm phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, and 20 ml of 1.0 m NaCl. After additional washing with 20 ml of 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, the matrix was packed in a PEEK column (4.6 × 50 mm). Antiserum was adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The solution was clarified by passage through a 0.2-μm filter. 0.4 ml of filtrate was applied at 10 ml/min to the antigen column previously equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After the column was washed with 4.1 ml of buffer B and with 12.5 ml of buffer B, 0.15 m NaCl, the adsorbed antibody was eluted using 12.4 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 3.0, followed by 3.4 ml of 100 mm sodium citrate, 1.5 m NaCl, pH 3.0. The eluate was collected as 10-ml fractions in tubes containing 2 ml of 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to immediately neutralize the citric acid. Purified antibody was concentrated to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml using ultrafiltration with YM1 cellulose membranes. The antibody solution was adjusted to 10 mm phosphate, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4. After filtration of the solution through a 0.2-μm filter 100 μl of filtrate was applied at 0.2 ml/min to a POROS 20 PA column (2.1 × 30 mm). This step was repeated 17 times. Adsorbed antibody was cross-linked using cross-linking solution (100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.5). After the column was washed with 5 ml of buffer C (10 mm phosphate, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.4) 2 ml of cross-linking solution was applied at 0.5 ml/min onto the cartridge. The procedure was repeated 6 more times, using a total volume of 14 ml of cross-linking solution. To block unreacted functional groups on the cross-linking reagents 2 ml of 100 mm monoethanolamine, pH 9.0 (quenching solution), was loaded onto the cartridge at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed using 2 ml of buffer C and the cross-linking step was repeated using another 2-ml quenching solution. The immunoaffinity column was cycled between buffer C and 12 mm HCl, 0.15 m NaCl 3 times using a total volume of 12 ml of solution. XT-containing fractions eluted from the heparin affinity matrix were desalted using diafiltration with YM1-cellulose membranes and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. 100 μl of this XT sample was applied to the immunoaffinity column equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 1.4 ml of buffer D and with 8.5 ml of buffer D, 0.15m NaCl. The XT activity was eluted with 4.2 ml of 12 mm HCl followed by 1.2 ml of 12 mm HCl, 1.5m NaCl. Alternatively the elution was performed using 100 μl of antigen at 1 mg/ml in buffer D. Fractions (1 ml) were collected into tubes containing 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The XT activities of the fractions were determined. 200 μl of desalted XT solution from the heparin purification step was applied at 10 ml/min to the aprotinin column previously equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 6.6 ml of buffer A the adsorbed protein was eluted stepwise using the same buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl (10.0 ml), 0.54 m NaCl (10.0 ml), 1.00 m NaCl (10.0 ml), and 1.50 mNaCl (2.4 ml). Fractions of 5 ml were collected and assayed for XT activity. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a semi-dry instrument (Novex). After transfer nonspecific antibody-binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with antiserum in 50 mm phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5 ml/liter Tween 20, pH 7.4, at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected using a second anti-rabbit goat immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase at a 1:1000 dilution. The blot was developed using 4-chloro-1-naphthol. A sample of 100 μl from the heparin purification step was applied at 1.0 ml/min to a TSK G3000 SW column (30 cm × 7.5 mm, 10-μm particle size) which had previously been equilibrated with buffer A, 0.15 m NaCl. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer. Fractions of 200 μl were collected and tested for XT activity. Column calibration was performed using thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). Aliquots (1 μg) of XT were digested with 3, 1 × 10−3 units of N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 1 and 12 h according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were detected by silver staining. Protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm assuming E1 cm1% = 10.0 or with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. 18.5 liters of enriched cell culture supernatant (equivalent to 2,000 liters normal cell culture supernatant) of serum-free cultivated JAR choriocarcinoma cells was required to isolate the XT in trace amounts. The so far unknown protein with a molecular mass of 120 kDa was enzymatically digested and a partial amino acid sequence was determined by Edman degradation and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A summary of the purification is shown in TableI and explained in detail below.Table IPurification of XTStepVolumeTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityPurificationRecoveryml10−3× unitsmg10−3 × units/mg-fold%JAR high density cell culture supernatant18,500535.889,355.00.0061100Ammonium sulfate precipitation460426.08,937.80.048879Heparin affinity chromatography50108.3473.00.2294035Ion exchange chromatography591.043.12.09034817Protamine affinity chromatography16.830.2428.4584,7431Summary of purification steps employed for isolation of XT from 18.5 liters of high density JAR cell culture supernatant. Open table in a new tab Summary of purification steps employed for isolation of XT from 18.5 liters of high density JAR cell culture supernatant. XT of the ammonium sulfate precipitable fraction was dissolved in 0.46 liters of buffer A with solubilization of 79.5% of the original activity. 4 ml of XT-enriched solution from step 1 was loaded onto the POROS 20 HE column. XT activity was completely retained on the column. More than 70% of total protein passed through the column. Contaminating protein was eluted at a low NaCl concentration. 44% of the XT activity bound to the heparin matrix emerged at 0.5 m NaCl (Fig.1 A). 4 ml of the desalted XT-containing fraction from step 2 was loaded onto the POROS 20 HQ column equilibrated in buffer A. More than 98% of the XT activity bound to the resin. The column was then eluted stepwise with NaCl in buffer A (Fig. 1 B). XT-containing fractions were collected. The product of step 3 was desalted and concentrated using dia- and ultrafiltration. 100 μl of the protein solution was applied to the POROS protamine chloride column previously equilibrated with buffer A. Approximately 95% of the transferase activity bound to the column, whereas 75% of the contaminating protein did not. Additional proteins were eluted with buffer A containing low NaCl concentrations. Enzyme activity was eluted at ∼0.15 m NaCl (Fig. 1 C). The enzyme activity was stable for at least 6 months at −75 °C. XT-containing fractions from steps 1–4 were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradie"
https://openalex.org/W2165749038,"Functional roles of the NH2-terminal region of RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) 8 in G protein signaling were studied. The deletion of the NH2-terminal region of RGS8 (ΔNRGS8) resulted in a partial loss of the inhibitory function in pheromone response of yeasts, although Gα binding was not affected. To examine roles in subcellular distribution, we coexpressed two fusion proteins of RGS8-RFP and ΔNRGS8-GFP in DDT1MF2 cells. RGS8-RFP was highly concentrated in nuclei of unstimulated cells. Coexpression of constitutively active Gαo resulted in translocation of RGS8 protein to the plasma membrane. In contrast, ΔNRGS8-GFP was distributed diffusely through the cytoplasm in the presence or absence of active Gαo. When coexpressed with G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ channels, ΔNRGS8 accelerated both turning on and off similar to RGS8. Acute desensitization of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+current observed in the presence of RGS8, however, was not induced by ΔNRGS8. Thus, we, for the first time, showed that the NH2terminus of RGS8 contributes to the subcellular localization and to the desensitization of the G protein-coupled response.

This protein family was originally identified as a pheromone desensitization factor in yeast (3Chan R.K. Otte C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Many members of RGS protein family were subsequently identified by virtue of a common stretch of 120 amino acids termed the RGS domain in organisms ranging from yeast to human (1Dohlman H.G.

It was shown that several RGS proteins (RGS1, RGS3, RGS4, and GAIP) attenuate G protein signaling in cultures (4Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies demonstrated that RGS members function as a GTPase-activating protein for α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (8Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 9Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J.

Therefore, RGS proteins are proposed to down-regulate G protein signaling in vivo by enhancing the rate of Gα GTP hydrolysis. We previously searched for RGS proteins specifically expressed in neural cells using a culture system of neuronally differentiating P19 cells. We isolated cDNA of RGS8 and identified it as a RGS protein induced in differentiated P19 cells (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, since RGS7 had been reported to be expressed predominantly in the brain (5Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), we also isolated a full-length cDNA of RGS7 (12Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicated that RGS8 binds to Gαo and Gαi3, and that RGS7 binds to Gαo, Gαi3, and Gαz. To examine effects of each RGS protein on G protein signaling, we coexpressed a G protein-coupled receptor and a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK1/2) (13Kubo Y. Reuveny E.

We observed that RGS8 significantly speeds up both activation and deactivation of GIRK current (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Doupnik et al. (16Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Kofuji P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) reported the similar accelerated kinetics of GIRK current by RGS1, RGS3, or RGS4. We further observed that RGS8 induces acute desensitization of receptor-activated GIRK current in the presence of ligands (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the case of RGS7, activation of GIRK current was clearly accelerated as with RGS8, but the acceleration effect on deactivation was significantly weaker than that of RGS8. The acute desensitization of receptor-activated GIRK observed with RGS8 was not apparent with RGS7. Thus, RGS7 and RGS8 were shown to accelerate G protein-mediated modulation of GIRK current differentially (12Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). What is the structural basis for the weaker off acceleration and reduced desensitization in the case of RGS7? One possibility is that a difference in the NH2-terminal domain contributes to the differential modulation of GIRK current. The conserved NH2-terminal domains of RGS4 and RGS16 were recently shown to be important for membrane association and biological function by the analysis of the ability to inhibit pheromone signaling in the budding yeast (17Chen C. Lin S.-C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A homologous domain was also found in the NH2 terminus of RGS8. Therefore, we investigated functional roles of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 in G protein signalings. We examined effects of deletion of this NH2-terminal domain on the pheromone signaling of yeasts, the Gα binding, the subcellular distribution, and the modulation of the receptor-activated GIRK current. A bioassay was used to measure the sensitivity of the pheromone response in yeast that expresses RGS proteins as described (20Saitoh O. Odagiri M. Masuho I. Nomoto S. Kinoshita N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the Myc tag (MEQKLISEEDLSRGS) was introduced into pTS210 yeast expression vector under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. By polymerase chain reaction amplification, cDNA fragments containing the coding sequence of RGS8 or ΔNRGS8 (mutant RGS8 which lacks NH2-terminal 35 amino acids) were isolated. After confirmation by sequencing analysis, they were fused in-frame immediately downstream of the Myc tag in pTS210. The sst2 deletion mutant yeast SNY86 (21Nomoto S. Adachi K. Yang L.-X. Hirata Y. Muraguchi S. Kiuchi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was transformed with each cDNA in pTS210 and selected on ura− dropout plates. Independent colonies of each yeast transformant were grown and a halo bioassay was performed. Single colonies of yeasts transformed with Myc-tagged RGS constructs were inoculated into ura− dropout medium supplemented with 2% galactose or glucose and were grown to an identical density (A 600 = 1). Yeast cells were precipitated and lysed in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were extracted by sonication, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Expression levels of Myc-tagged RGS proteins were then examined by Western blotting using anti-Myc tag monoclonal antibody (9E10, BabCO). Signals were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmasia Biotech). By polymerase chain reaction amplification, cDNA fragments for RGS8 and ΔNRGS8 were isolated. For ΔNRGS8, a forward primer that included the ATG start codon was used. After confirmation of their nucleotide sequences, they were cloned into pCXN2 expression vector provided by Professor Miyazaki (22Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were generated by in vitro transcription/translation of the resultant plasmid DNAs using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega) and biotinylated lysine-tRNA complex (TranscendTM tRNA, Promega). Each biotinylated protein was mixed with purified bovine Gαo in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 30 μmAlF4− (30 μmAlCl3, 10 mm NaF), and 0.1% polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether (C12E10). After incubation for 4 h at 4 °C, the reaction mixture was precleared with 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C, incubated with anti-bovine Gαo antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and then cleared with 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose for an additional 2 h. Protein G beads were washed four times in the binding buffer, suspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Co-immunoprecipitation of biotinylated protein was examined with streptavidine-horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Immunoprecipitation of Gαo was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-Gαo antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmasia Biotech). A Syrian hamster leiomyosarcoma cell line, DDT1MF2, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RGS8 and ΔNRGS8 expression constructs were described in the previous section on immunoprecipitation. The plasmid DNAs of these expression constructs were transfected into DDT1MF2 cells by the CaPO4 methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbor Lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After selection in the presence of G418 (0.8 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.), stable lines were established. The cultured cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the homogenate was centrifuged (44,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The resultant supernatant and precipitate were mixed with SDS sample buffer and used as cytosolic and particulate fractions. We expressed RGS8 and ΔNRGS8 as a chimeric protein with fluorescent protein at the carboxyl terminus. By polymerase chain reaction amplification, cDNA fragments for RGS8 and ΔNRGS8 were isolated. For ΔNRGS8, a forward primer that included the ATG start codon was used. After confirmation by sequencing analysis, RGS8 cDNA was fused in-frame to red fluorescent protein (RFP) in pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH) or in one particular experiment to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). ΔNRGS8 was ligated in-frame to the beginning of GFP in pEGFP-N1. Resultant plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into DDT1MF2 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). At 48 h after the transfection, transfected cells were fixed by treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss microscope connected with an LSM410 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Zeiss). The confocal images were collected using a ×63 objective. For a three-dimensional reconstructed image, transfected cells were examined with a LSM510 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Zeiss) and stacks of 35 images spaced by 0.35 μm were recorded. Two-electrode voltage clamp analysis was done as described previously (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The curve fittings of turning on and off phases were done by a fitting function of pClamp software (Axon) based on the Simplex method. The turning on phases were fitted with a single-exponential function. As the turning off phases of RGS8 and ΔNRGS8 data were fitted better with a two-exponential function, the fittings of them were done with a two-exponential function. When the turning off time course of the data of RGS(−) was fitted with a double-exponential function, the contribution of the slower component was small, and the time constant could not be determined reliably. Thus, the turning off phases of the data of RGS(−) were fitted with a single-exponential function. In the NH2-terminal region of RGS4 and RGS16 outside of the RGS domains, the sequence conservation was found, and it was shown that the deletion of this region reduced the effect to attenuate pheromone signaling in yeasts (17Chen C. Lin S.-C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison revealed that the NH2 terminus of RGS8 is similar to the conserved NH2-terminal sequences found in RGS4, RGS16, and also RGS5 (Fig. 1). However, the conserved cysteine residues (Cys-2, Cys-12) which were reported to be palmitoylated (18Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) are absent in the NH2 terminus of RGS8. To define the role of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8, we analyzed the ability of RGS8 mutant lacking the NH2-terminal 35 amino acids (ΔNRGS8) to inhibit the pheromone response pathway inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, as shown in Fig.2 A. Wild type RGS8 inhibited the growth arrest response to mating pheromone. Deletion of the NH2 terminus 35 amino acids resulted in a partial loss of function; i.e. ΔNRGS8 could not efficiently attenuate the effect of pheromone signaling. This effect of removal of the NH2 terminus on RGS8 function was confirmed by comparing the size of the halos of growth inhibition of cell lawns grown on agar plates (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it is clear that the NH2-terminal region of RGS8 is required for its full ability to function in yeasts. Expression levels of wild and mutant RGS8 proteins in yeast cells grown in galactose were determined by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 C). Similar expression levels were detected, indicating that the functional difference was not due to impairment of expression. The specificity of the antibody was tested by using yeasts grown in glucose (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of ΔNRGS8 on the response of yeasts to mating pheromone. A , cells of the sst2 strain (SNY86) carrying pTS210 vector, RGS8-pTS210, and ΔNRGS8-pTS210 were plated on soft agar containing 0.5% galactose. Sterile filter disks were placed on the nascent lawn, and synthesized α-pheromone was applied to the discs. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h. The amount of α-pheromone added to each disc was: 0 ng (top left), 0.2 ng (top right), 2 ng (bottom right), 20 ng (bottom left). B, the effect of removal of NH2 terminus on RGS8 function was statistically confirmed. The size of the halo of growth inhibition of cell lawns grown on agar plates was calculated by measuring its diameter. Results were expressed as a percentage of the control halo with vector alone. The mean and S.D. (n = 4) were as follows. RGS(−): 100 ± 2.6%, RGS8(+): 8.2 ± 4.5%, ΔNRGS8(+): 18.1 ± 2.8%. Values of ΔNRGS8 were significantly different from those of wild type RGS8 (p value = 0.0096) by Student's unpairedt test. C, two colonies isolated from each yeast (SNY86) transformed with pTS210 vector, RGS8-pTS210, and ΔNRGS8-pTS210 were cultured in galactose-containing medium. Expression of RGS8 was detected by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined whether NH2-terminal deletion affects the G protein binding activity of RGS8. Biotin-labeled proteins of the wild type and ΔNRGS8 were generated by in vitro transcription and translation. Each labeled RGS8 protein was incubated with purified bovine Gαo in the presence of GDP and AlF4−. The complex containing Gαo was immunoprecipitated using anti-Gαoantibody. Similar to wild type RGS8, ΔNRGS8 was recovered with Gαo (Fig. 3). From these results, it was clearly demonstrated that the NH2-terminal deletion of RGS8 does not affect G protein binding activity. How can the NH2-terminal domain modulate the function of RGS8 without changing the properties of interaction with Gα? It has been demonstrated that the NH2-terminal domains of RGS4 and RGS16 serve as a membrane targeting sequence in yeasts (18Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Chen C. Seow K.T. Guo K. Yaw L.P. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19799-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 influences its intracellular distribution or not, wild type RGS8 or ΔNRGS8 cDNA was transfected to DDT1MF2 cells, which do not express endogenous RGS8, and their cell homogenates were fractionated. Cytoplasmic and particulate fractions were subjected to Western blotting analysis using the RGS8-specific antibody (Fig.4). The specificity of the antibody was determined by Western blotting of whole cell extracts from control cells and cells transfected with RGS8 cDNA. Wild type RGS8 was present in the particulate fraction. In contrast, ΔNRGS8 was abundantly detected in the cytoplasm. In both transfected cells, Gαq/11 was exclusively present in the particulate fraction. These results clearly demonstrated that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 is required for its subcellular distribution. To further investigate the cellular distribution of RGS8 in cultured cells and also to examine roles of its NH2 terminus, two different fluorescent proteins were fused to RGS8 and ΔNRGS8, respectively, and they were coexpressed in DDT1MF2 cells. RGS8 was expressed as a chimeric protein with RFP at the carboxyl terminus and ΔNRGS8 was coexpressed as a chimeric protein with GFP. Surprisingly, RGS8-RFP was highly concentrated in nuclei of most transfected cells (Fig. 5,upper). On the other hand, ΔNRGS8-GFP was diffusely distributed through the cytoplasm within identical cells (Fig. 5,middle). These observations were consistent with the analysis using the cell fractionation method (Fig. 4), since the particulate fraction contains nuclei and cell membranes. These results clearly demonstrated that RGS8 is localized in nuclei in DDT1MF2 cells, and that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 is required for this unique nuclear localization. Sequence comparison revealed that the NH2 terminus of RGS8 is similar to the conserved NH2-terminal sequences of RGS4 and RGS16, but that the first 7 amino acids of RGS8 are unique (Fig. 1). A search for the subcellular localization sites of protein identified a putative nuclear localization signal sequence, PRRNK at amino acids 7–11. This nuclear localization signal sequence was thought to function in the distribution of RGS8 in nonactivated DDT1MF2 cells. The nuclear localization of RGS8 was further confirmed by an immunofluorescence method. DDT1MF2, NIH3T3, and HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA of wild type RGS8 without fluorescent protein and were immunostained with anti-RGS8 antibody. In all cases, similar nuclear localization of RGS8 was observed (data not shown). RGS proteins interact directly with Gα in its active state (9Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 10Hunt T.W. Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Peralta E.G. Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and the heterotrimeric G protein complex is mainly associated with cell membranes. Since RGS8 was found to be localized to nuclei in DDT1MF2 cells, it is considered to be unable to efficiently interact with Gα in the cells activated by stimulation of G proteins. To investigate the subcellular localization of RGS8 after G protein activation, a constitutively active Gα was further coexpressed in DDT1MF2 cells. We previously showed that RGS8 binds preferentially to Gαoand Gαi3 (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When Gαo Q205L was further coexpressed for 48 h, a marked translocation of RGS8 to the plasma membrane was observed (Fig. 6,upper). In many cells, RGS8-RFP was concentrated to unique membrane structures that may correspond to membrane ruffles or microprojections and to the cell periphery. The nuclear localization of RGS8-RFP, which was intense in unstimulated cells, tended to decrease or disappear in Gαo Q205L-expressing cells. The distribution of ΔNRGS8-GFP, however, was not significantly influenced by expression of active Gαo and ΔNRGS8-GFP showed a relatively uniform pattern of distribution (Fig. 6, middle). In control cells transfected with RFP cDNA, a diffuse and sometimes punctuate pattern was observed and the distribution was clearly different from that of RGS8-RFP. Coexpression of GαoQ205L had almost no effect on the distribution of RFP. Thus, RGS8 was shown to be translocated to plasma membrane by G protein-activated signalings. It is clear that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 is required for this translocation. ΔNRGS8 could bind to Gαo, but it could not translocate to the membrane on coexpression of Gαo Q205L. Therefore, it was thought that the membrane recruitment of RGS8 was not a direct result of the physical association with Gα. We further investigated the morphological structure of the region to which RGS8 was translocated on coexpression of Gαo Q205L by confocal microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstitution of confocal slice images revealed that the structures where RGS8 accumulated as indicated in Fig. 6,left, were fine projections or microspikes present on the surface of DDT1MF2 cells (Fig. 7).Figure 7Three-dimensional reconstructed image of RGS8 translocated by G protein activation. RGS8 was expressed as a chimeric protein with GFP in DDT1MF2 cells. A constitutively active Gαo cDNA (RGS8 + Gαo Q205L) or control vector (RGS8+vector) was co-transfected. At 48 h after transfection, confocal images were collected and a three-dimensional reconstructed image was obtained. The obtained image was rotated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GIRK channels are known to be activated directly by Gβγ subunits released by the Gi family. They are activated by G protein-coupled receptors such as m2 muscarinic and D2 dopamine receptors. We previously coexpressed GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromultimer and m2 muscarinic receptor with or without RGS8 inXenopus oocytes and analyzed the effects of RGS8 on G protein-mediated modulation of K+ currents. We reported that RGS8 speeds up the activation and deactivation kinetics of GIRK upon receptor stimulation. We also reported the RGS8-induced acute desensitization of the receptor-activated GIRK current (11Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Odagiri M. Ichikawa M. Yamagata K. Sekine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9899-9904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the functional role of the NH2-terminal domain, which determines subcellular localization, in the RGS8-mediated modulation of on-off kinetics of GIRK current. We coexpressed RGS8 or ΔNRGS8 with GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromultimer and m2 muscarinic receptor inXenopus oocytes. ΔNRGS8 coexpression accelerated both the turning on and off to a similar extent as the wild type RGS8. The acute desensitization of receptor-activated GIRK current, however, was much less clear in oocytes expressing ΔNRGS8 (Fig.8 A). These observations were confirmed quantitatively by comparing the time constants of the exponential functions used for the fitting of the activation (τon) and deactivation (τoff) phases (detail in the legends of Fig. 8 B) and the extent of desensitization (Fig. 8 B). Thus, we identified a novel function of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 to cause acute desensitization of GIRK current activated by receptor stimulation. In this study, we demonstrated the functional significance of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8. First, we compared this region of RGS8 with those of RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16 and identified a conserved sequence in the NH2 terminus. By using a yeast halo assay, we showed that the deletion of the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 results in a partial loss of function to inhibit the pheromone response pathway. We used pTS210, a single-copy expression vector under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. When a higher concentration of galactose or multicopy vector was used, we could not detect a clear difference in the sensitivity to the mating pheromone of yeasts carrying RGS8 and ΔNRGS8. Under these conditions of overexpression, a proper subcellular distribution might not be necessary for sufficient function of RGS8 because of high amount within the cells. We unexpectedly found that RGS8 is predominantly localized in the nuclei of DDT1MF2 cells. This nuclear localization of RGS8 was shown by its fusion protein with a fluorescent protein (GFP or RFP) and further confirmed immunocytochemically with anti-RGS8 antibody. Similar nuclear localization of RGS8 was observed in 3T3 and HEK293 cells transfected with RGS8 cDNA. We, moreover, showed that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 is required for its nuclear localization within cells. In the case of RGS4, despite having a similar conserved sequence in the NH2 terminus (Fig. 1), a predominant localization in the cytoplasm has been reported using HEK293 cells transfected with RGS4 cDNA (24Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Considering the subcellular distributions of RGS8 and RGS4, it is possible that the first 7 amino acids in the NH2 terminus of RGS8 are responsible for the unique nuclear localization. Indeed, we found a potential NLS sequence at amino acids 7–11. Quite recently, a truncated isoform of RGS3, termed RGS3T, has been reported to be localized to the nucleus and induce apoptosis in RGS3T-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (25Dulin N.O. Pratt P. Tiruppathi C. Niu J. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21317-21323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two potential nuclear localization signal sequences were found in the NH2 terminus of RGS3T and truncation of the NH2 terminus resulted in a reduction of nuclear localization. RGS8 in nucleus might also function in cellular processes such as apoptosis. We showed that RGS8 is translocated from the nucleus to the plasma membrane structures by coexpression of Gαo Q205L in DDT1MF2 cells. The NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 was shown to play critical roles in this membrane recruitment, since mutant RGS8 lacking the NH2-terminal sequence of 35 amino acids could not translocate to the membrane within identical cells. This ΔNRGS8 contains an intact RGS domain, which is sufficient for the interaction with Gα. Therefore, the mechanism of the membrane translocation was considered to be independent of RGS8-G protein interaction. RGS4 was also reported to be recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane on the expression of activated, GTPase-deficient Gαi2(24Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was shown that a non-Gα binding mutant of RGS4 could translocate like wild type RGS4, indicating that this translocation was not a direct result of physical association with an activated Gα. It is possible that G protein activation triggers binding of unidentified cellular factors to the subcellular localization signals of the NH2 terminus of RGS proteins for translocation to the membrane. When coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with a G protein-coupled receptor and GIRK1/2, ΔNRGS8 accelerated the turning on and off of GIRK current upon receptor stimulation similar to wild type RGS8. Wild type RGS8 induced significant levels of acute desensitization of the response during receptor activation, but the desensitization in oocytes expressing ΔNRGS8 was similar to that in control oocytes. These results demonstrated that the NH2-terminal domain of RGS8 is required to cause acute desensitization of GIRK. Indeed, we previously reported that RGS7, which contains the characteristic long NH2 terminus different from that of RGS8, showed slower desensitization. Kovoor et al. (26Kovoor A. Chen C.-K. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 275: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (77) Google Scholar) also made similar recordings of receptor-activated GIRK current in Xenopus oocytes expressing RGS proteins. Their data indicated that RGS4 induces acute desensitization, but that RGS7 and RGS9 do not cause significant desensitization. RGS4 has a similar NH2-terminal sequence to RGS8, and both RGS7 and RGS9 possess the long NH2terminus containing DEP (Dishevelled/EGL10/pleckstrin homology) and GGL (G protein γ subunit-like) domains instead of the short conserved NH2 terminus of RGS8. What is the mechanism behind the desensitization in the presence of RGS8? If we assume that there are only two forms of G protein (nonactive and active) and two rate constants (α, on-rate; β, off-rate), the current amplitude is expected to increase single exponentially with a time constant of 1/(α+β). In this case, no desensitization is expected to occur. To explain the presence of desensitization in the two-state model, it is necessary to assume a gradual decrease in the on-rate or a gradual increase in the off-rate in the course of the receptor stimulation. As the turn-on speed, determined dominantly by α, was not significantly decreased by the second ligand application immediately after the initial trial (data not shown), it appears that the on-rate was not decreased during the ligand stimulation. If the off-rate is increased during the response, the turning off after ligand washout should be faster with RGS8, which showed a more intense desensitization. As the turning off speed after ligand washout was similar between RGS8 and ΔNRGS8, the off-rate was not increased during the response. Thus, the desensitization could not be explained by a gradual change of the on- or off-rate. What then is the mechanism of desensitization in the presence of RGS8? With the assumption that there are three states, a nonactive nonready state, a nonactive ready state, and an active state, the desensitization could be explained by the depletion of the ready pool as discussed by Chuanget al. (27Chuang H.-H., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11727-11732Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of a large ready pool enables the acceleration of the turning on, but at the same time the depletion of the ready pool during the response could result in the acute desensitization even if the on-rate and off-rate are not changed. If this is the case, the NH2-terminal region of RGS8 is thought to be necessary for the formation of the ready pool and for its depletion during the response. It is speculated that the NH2 terminus of RGS8 controls the G protein pool by controlling its subcellular distribution, although further study is required to understand how this enlarged G protein pool is regulated by RGS proteins.

Stimulation of BSP mRNA with 10 ng/ml FGF2 was first evident at 3 h (∼2.6-fold) and reached maximal levels at 6 h (∼4-fold). From transient transfection assays, a FGF response element (FRE) was identified (nucleotides −92 to −85, “GGTGAGAA”) as a target of transcriptional activation by FGF2. Ligation of two copies of the FRE 5′ to an SV40 promoter was sufficient to confer FGF-responsive transcription. A sequence-specific protein-DNA complex, formed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing the FRE and nuclear extracts from ROS 17/2.8 cells, but not from fibroblasts, was increased following FGF2 stimulation. Several point mutations within the critical FRE sequence abrogated the formation of this complex and suppressed both basal and FGF2-mediated promoter activity. These studies, therefore, have identified a novel FRE in the proximal promoter of the BSP gene that mediates both constitutive and FGF2-induced BSP transcription.

The expression of BSP is essentially restricted in the mineralized connective tissues. Studies on the developmental expression of BSP have shown that BSP mRNA is produced at high levels at the onset of bone, dentin, and cementum formation (5Chen J. Shapiro H.S. Wrana J.L. Reimers S.

Recent studies have shown that BSP is also expressed in osteotropic cancers, suggesting BSP might play a role in the pathogenesis of bone metastases (10Waltregny D. Bellahcène A. Leval X.D. Florkin B. Weidle U. Castronovo V. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 834-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of the BSP gene is important in the differentiation of osteoblasts, in bone matrix mineralization and in tumor metastasis. The human (11Kim R.H. Shapiro H.S. Li J.J. Wrana J.L.

J. 1993; 289: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) BSP genes have been cloned and partially characterized. These promoters include a highly conserved region (BSP box) that extends upstream from the transcription start site to nt −370 (15Sodek J. Li J.J. Kim R.H. Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This region includes a functional, inverted TATA element (nts −24 to −19) (16Li J.J. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Biochem.

J. 1996; 318: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, putative sites of regulation through an inverted CCAAT box (−50 to −46) (18Kim R.H. Sodek J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar) and an AP-2 site (−447 to −440), which overlaps a transforming growth factor-β activation element, have been identified in the proximal promoter (19Ogata Y. Niisato N. Furuyama S. Cheifetz S. Kim R.H. Sugiya H. Sodek J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 501-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Further upstream, a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) overlapping an AP-1 site has been characterized (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J.

Recently, we have identified a pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) motif through which the stimulatory effects of parathyroid hormone on BSP transcription are mediated (22Ogata Y. Nakao S. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. Sodek J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), while studies by Benson et al. (23Benson M.D. Bargeon J.L. Xiao G.

Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2 or basic FGF), a member of the heparin-binding growth factor family of mitogens, has been implicated in a range of normal physiological processes from embryonic mesoderm induction and pattern formation to angiogenesis and wound repair (24Mason I.J.

FGF2 is also synthesized by osteoblasts and is stored in a bioactive form in the extracellular matrix (26Hurley M.M. Abreu C. Harrison J.R. Lichtler A.C. Raisz L.G. Kream B. J. Biol.

Four distinct gene products encode highly homologous FGF receptors (FGFRs; FGFR1–4), which share 56–71% amino acid sequence identity. The FGF receptors contain three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Immunoglobulin-like domains II and III are sufficient for FGF binding and determine affinity (30Debiais F. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Marie P.J. J. Bone Miner.

Mutations in the FGFR1 gene are associated with Pfeiffer syndrome, which is one of the classic autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndromes (31Muenke M. Schell U. Hehr A. Robin N.H. Losken H.W. Schinzel A. Pulleyn L.J. Rutland P. Reardon W. Malcolm S. Winter R.M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), while mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 produce genetic disorders involving bone development. Jackson-Weiss and Crouzon syndromes are allelic with mutations in FGFR2 (32Jabs E.W. Li X. Scott A.F. Meyers G. Chen W. Eccles M. Mao J. Charnas L.R. Jackson C.E. Jaye M. Nat.

Thanatophoric dysplasia, the most common neonatal lethal skeletal dysplasia, and achondroplasia are caused by mutations in FGFR3 (34Tavormina P.L. Shiang R. Thompson L.M. Zhu Y.Z. Wilkin D.J. Lachman R.S. Wilcox W.R. Rimoin D.L. Cohn D.H. Wasmuth J.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Analysis of FGFR3-deficient mice has revealed prolonged bone growth, showing that FGFR3 is a negative regulator of bone growth (35Den C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Collectively these studies, and the observation that intravenous FGF2 stimulates bone formation and mineralization (28Nakamura T. Hanada K. Tamura M. Shibanushi T. Nigi H. Tagawa M. Fukumoto S. Matsumoto T. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1276-1284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Liang H. Pun S. Wronski T.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5780-5788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicate that FGF is an important regulator of bone formation. FGF2 inhibits alkaline phosphatase activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells (27Rodan S.B. Wesolowski G. Yoon K. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19934-19941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the calcification of hypertrophic chondrocytes (37Kato Y. Iwamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5903-5909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF2 also inhibits type I collagen and osteocalcin transcription in ROS 17/2.8 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells (26Hurley M.M.

However, the combination of FGF2 and forskolin markedly up-regulates osteocalcin mRNA accumulation in MC3T3-E1 cells (38Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An osteocalcin FGF2 response element (GCAGTCA motif) has been identified in the proximal promoter of the rat osteocalcin gene as a target of FGF2 and cAMP stimulation (38Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The induction of human osteocalcin transcription by FGF2 requires the interaction of CCAAT motif that overlaps with three tandem repeats of a nuclear factor-1 half-site (TTGGC) (39Schedlich L.J. Flanagan J.L. Crofts L.A. Gillies S.A. Goldberg D. Morrison N.A. Eisman J.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanism of FGF2 regulation of the BSP gene, we have analyzed the effects of the FGF2 on the expression of BSP in ROS 17/2.8 cells. These studies have revealed a novel FRE that mediates both the constitutive and FGF2-induced expression of BSP in osteoblastic cells. Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, LipofectACE, penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., Tokyo, Japan. The pGL2-promoter vector, pSV-β-galactosidase control vector, and MEK inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Promega Co., Madison, WI. 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole was from Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan, the protein kinase inhibitors H89 and H7 were from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan, and herbimycin A and guanidium thiocyanate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. PP1 was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA, and recombinant human FGF2 was from Genzyme, Techne, Minneapolis, MN. The rat clonal cell lines, ROS 17/2.8 (generously provided by Dr. G. A. Rodan, Merck-Sharpe and Frosst, West Point, PA) was used in these studies as an osteoblastic cell line that synthesizes BSP (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes in α-MEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum were changed to α-MEM without serum and incubated with or without 10 ng/ml FGF2 for time periods extending over 3–24 h. To determine the effect of FGF2 on the stability of BSP mRNA, cells were first incubated for 6 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml FGF2 and the incubation continued for up to 24 h in the presence of 60 μm concentration of the transcription inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole. RNA was isolated from triplicate cultures at various time intervals and analyzed for the expression of BSP mRNA by Northern hybridization as described below. Total RNA from the culture cells was extracted with guanidium thiocyanate and, following purification, 20-μg aliquots of RNA were fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond N membrane, as described previously (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C with either a32P-labeled rat BSP or rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), DNA probe. Following hybridization, membranes were washed four times for 5 min each at 21 °C in 300 mmsodium chloride, 30 mm trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% SDS. This was followed by two, 20-min washes at 55 °C in 15 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mmtrisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS. The hybridized bands, representing the two polyadenylated forms (1.6 and 2.0 kilobases) of rat BSP mRNA, were scanned in a Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji BAS 2000, Tokyo, Japan) and normalized to the expression of GAPDH. Exponentially growing ROS 17/2.8 cells were used for transfection assays. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells at 50-70% confluence were transfected using a LipofectACE reagent. The transfection mixture included 1 μg of a luciferase (LUC) construct (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and 2 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase vector as an internal control. Two days post-transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 12 h, and 10 ng/ml FGF2 was added for 6 h prior to harvesting. The luciferase assay was performed according to the supplier's protocol (picaGene, Toyo Inki, Tokyo, Japan) using a Luminescence reader BLR20 (Aloka) to measure the luciferase activity. The protein kinase inhibitor H89 (5 μm) and H7 (5 μm) were used to inhibit protein kinases A and C. Herbimycin A (1 μm) and PP1 (10 μm) were used for tyrosine kinase and Src tyrosine kinase inhibition, respectively (40Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

U0126 (5 μm) was used for MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor (41Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

The FRE sequence, identified from the transient transfection studies, was cloned in the BglII site of pGL2-promoter vector, immediately upstream of the enhancerless SV40 promoter. This construct was used to identify the sequence within the BSP promoter that is required for transcriptional induction by FGF2. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis by PCR was utilized to introduce the dinucleotide substitutions using the Quikchange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs were sequenced as described previously (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to verify the fidelity of the mutagenesis. The pCG-ATF2 and pCG-ATF3 expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. T. Hai (42Chen B.P.C. Liang G. Whelan J. Hai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15819-15826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent ROS 17/2.8 cells in T-75 flasks incubated for 6 and 12 h with 10 ng/ml FGF2 in α-MEM without serum were used to prepare nuclear extracts as we have described previously (19Ogata Y.

For gel shift analysis the double-stranded-oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear protein extracts (3 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature (room temperature = 21 °C) with 0.1 pmradiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments unlabeled oligonucleotides for the inverted CCAAT, FRE, FREm1, 2,3,4,3′-FRE, BSP-NFκB, Igκ-NFκB, and consensus AP1 and GRE (Promega) were used at 20-, 40-, and 100-fold molar excess. Following incubation, the protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% nondenaturing acrylamide gels (38:2 acrylamide/bis acrylamide) run at 150 V at room temperature. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiograms prepared and analyzed using an image analyzer. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each experiment and experiments replicated to ensure consistency of the responses to FGF2. Significant differences between control and FGF2 treatment were determined using Student's t test. To study the regulation of BSP expression by FGF2, we used ROS 17/2.8 cells, which have been shown to have osteoblastic characteristics (44Majeska R.J. Rodan S.B. Rodan G.A. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,45Majeska R.J. Rodan G.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1982; 34: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and to express BSP mRNA constitutively (20Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Kim R.H. Li J.J. Freedman L.P. Sodek J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). First, a dose-response relation for FGF2 induction of BSP was established by treating the ROS 17/2.8 cells with different concentrations of FGF2 for 6 h and measuring the BSP mRNA levels by Northern blot analysis. At 1–50 ng/ml, FGF2 increased BSP mRNA with a maximal effect at 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1 A). This optimal level of FGF2 (10 ng/ml) was used to determine a time course of BSP mRNA expression (Fig. 1 B). FGF2 up-regulated BSP mRNA accumulation markedly in ROS 17/2.8 cells. A stimulation of 2.6-fold was evident 3 h after the addition of FGF2, with maximal levels (4.0-fold) of BSP mRNA obtained at 6 h. In comparison, osteopontin mRNA, which has been shown previously to be stimulated by FGF2 (27Rodan S.B. Wesolowski G. Yoon K. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19934-19941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was increased at 3 h and returned to base line at 12 h, whereas no effect on GAPDH mRNA was observed. To determine whether the increase in BSP mRNA was due to an increased stability of the BSP mRNA in response to FGF2 treatment, ROS 17/2.8 cells were incubated in the presence of the transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole and the BSP mRNA levels determined over a 24-h period. From regression analysis at 12 of ∼16 h was determined for BSP mRNA in the ROS 17/2.8 cells with no significant change observed in the presence of FGF2, indicating that the increase in mRNA was due to increased gene transcription (data not shown). To determine the site of FGF2-regulated transcription in the 5′-flanking region of the BSP gene, various sized promoter constructs ligated to a luciferase reporter gene were transiently transfected into ROS 17/2.8 cells and their transcriptional activity determined in the presence of FGF2. The constructs used, pLUC1-pLUC5, encompassing nucleotides −116 to +60, gave a 2.9-fold increase in transcription after 6 h treatment with 10 ng/ml FGF2 (Fig.2). FGF2 also increased transcription of pLUC4 (−425 to +60) and pLUC5 (−801 to +60). Within the DNA sequence that is unique to pLUC3 (between nts −116 to −43), an inverted CCAAT box (ATTGG; between nts −50 and −46), a possible cAMP response element (CRE; between nts −75 and −68), and a pituitary-specific transcription factor-1 (Pit-1) motif (between nts −111 and −105), which is the target of parathyroid hormone stimulation, are present (Fig.3 A).Figure 3The nucleotide sequences of the rat BSP gene proximal promoter is shown from nts −116 to −43.

DNA sequences that are identical between the species are shown by a dot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By using a series of 5′ deletion constructs between nts −116 and −43, we found that the FGF2 response was mediated by a region between nts −108 and −84 of the promoter sequence (Fig.4). A series of 2-base pair mutations were made between nts −92 and −85 within pLUC3 construct (Fig.5). All four constructs (mutations 1–4; pLUC3m1–4) had lower basal activities than pLUC3 and resulted in near abolition of the FGF2 effects on the promoter. In particular, the mutation in pLUC3m2 drastically reduced basal expression and completely abolished the FGF2 effect (Fig. 5). Thus, the GGTGAGAA motif (FRE, FGF response element) in the region nts −92 to −85 is important for basal expression as well as being necessary for the FGF2 induction of BSP promoter activity. To examine whether the FRE of the rat BSP promoter confers FGF2-dependent inducibility in the context of a promoter that is not stimulated by FGF2, the DNA segment between nts −98 and −79 in the rat BSP gene was inserted 5′ to the SV40 in theBglII site of the pGL2-promoter. While the insertion of a single FRE sequence in the same orientation as in the BSP promoter did not influence basal activity of the SV40 promoter, and only a modest increase in FGF-mediated transcription was found, two copies of FRE increased basal activity and significantly increased FGF-mediated transcription (Fig. 6). Notably, the FRE sequences identified in the rat BSP promoter are conserved in the mouse and human BSP promoters (Fig. 3 B;underlined).Figure 5GGTGAGAA motif at nts −92 to −85 in the rat BSP promoter is necessary for induction by FGF2. A series of dinucleotide substitutions were made within context of the homologous −116 to +60 BSP promoter fragment (pLUC3). The constructs were analyzed for relative promoter activity after transfection into ROS17/2.8 cells and examined for induction in the presence of FGF2 (10 ng/ml). The results of transcriptional activity obtained from three separate transfections with constructs pLUCB, pLUC3, and pLUC3 mutations 1–4 (pLUC3m1 to pLUC3m4) were combined and the values expressed with S.E. Significant differences from relative luciferase activity of pLUC3: *, p < 0.1; **, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.02.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig"

Chloroplast mRNAs accumulate in fully developed chloroplasts to relatively high levels in both light- and dark-grown plants and algae. Translation of these mRNAs occurs at a much higher rate during the light-growth phase, thus identifying translation as a key regulatory point (reviewed in Refs. 2Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Hauser C.R.

The molecular basis of light-regulated translation in the chloroplast has been shown to be dependent on the function of a growing list of nucleus-encoded proteins (7Jensen K.H. Herrin D.L.

These factors are thought to mediate translational regulation by interacting with the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR)1 of chloroplast mRNAs (11Zerges W. Girard-Bascou J. Rochaix J.-D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3440-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Stampacchia O. Girard-Bascou J. Zanasco J.L. Zerges W. Bennoun P. Rochaix J.-D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins are typically directed to the chloroplast by a transit peptide located at the amino terminus of the protein (18Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A set of mRNA-binding proteins that bind to the chloroplasticpsbA mRNA 5′-UTR with high affinity and specificity has been identified and purified from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells (19Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). psbA mRNA 5′-UTR-binding proteins are composed of four major proteins, RB38, RB47, RB55, and RB60. These form a complex (psbA 5′-PC) that appears to bind the mRNA via the RB47 protein. The level of binding of psbA 5′-PC to the mRNA parallels the level of psbA mRNA translation and its association with polyribosomes in light- and dark-grown wild-type C. reinhardtii (19Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, several nuclear mutants have been isolated in which the loss of RB47 is accompanied by the absence of D1 synthesis due to a block in the association ofpsbA mRNA with polyribosomes (10Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3560-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that light regulates polyribosome association and translation ofpsbA mRNA by modulating the binding of psbA 5′-PC to the 5′-UTR. Cloning of RB47 revealed its high homology with poly(A)-binding proteins (10Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Characterization of the intrachloroplast localization of RB47 showed that it is associated with thylakoids in the C. reinhardtii chloroplast (21Zerges W. Rochaix J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RB60 has been implicated as a regulatory subunit of psbA 5′-PC which is subject to light control via phosphorylation and redox signals in the chloroplast (22Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cloning of RB60 identified high homology to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (24Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PDI-like proteins typically catalyze the formation, reduction, and isomerization of disulfide bonds during protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, in addition to their enzymatic role, PDI-like proteins have also been found to be indispensable subunits in protein complexes such as prolyl hydroxylase and triacylglycerol transfer protein (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDI-like proteins have recently been implicated in the regulation of E2A transcription factor (26Markus M. Benezra R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1040-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the shedding of L-selectin (27Bennett T.A. Edwards B.S. Sklar L.A. Rogelj S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4120-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PDIs are most abundant in the lumen of the ER. They are directed to the ER by a signal peptide at the amino terminus and then are retained there by virtue of a second signal, -(K/H)DEL, at the carboxyl terminus (25Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 28Pelham H.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the recombinant RB60 (rRB60) contains an amino-terminal extension, the targeting identity of which has yet to be determined. Notably, despite the implicated function of rRB60 in the chloroplast, its open reading frame contains a carboxyl-terminal signal for ER retention (24Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first set out to determine whether the cloned rRB60 gene product is targeted to chloroplasts, and thereafter to study the subchloroplast localization of the native RB60. We show that rRB60 is imported into isolated C. reinhardtii and pea chloroplasts in a transit peptide-dependent fashion. Subfractionation of chloroplasts showed that whereas a portion of the native RB60 is present in the stroma, it is also found tightly bound to thylakoids. Moreover, following uptake by chloroplasts, the recombinant rRB60 associates with thylakoids in a manner similar to the native RB60. The association of RB60 to thylakoids was resistant to EDTA and RNase treatments, indicating that it is probably not mediated by binding to polysome-associated psbA mRNA. C. reinhardtii cw 15 cells were grown in Tris/acetate/phosphate medium (29Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), under a 12-h light/12-h dark period at 25 °C, to a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. Intact chloroplasts were collected from the 45/70% interface of discontinuous Percoll gradient according to a protocol based on Goldschmidt-Clermont et al. (30Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Malnoe P. Rochaix J.-D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Belknap (31Belknap W.R. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pea seedlings (Pisum sativum var. Alaska) were grown under standard conditions (32Koussevitzky S. Ne'eman E. Sommer A. Steffens J.C. Harel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27064-27069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Intact chloroplasts were isolated on Percoll gradients as described (32Koussevitzky S. Ne'eman E.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined spectrophotometrically according to method of Arnon (34Arnon D. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro protein synthesis reactions were performed with a T3TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega) using 2 μg of DNA from RB60, Δ28RB60, LHCII, or SSU, or pea PPO cDNA containing plasmid constructs. Translation products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and protein incorporation of [35S]methionine was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In vitro import assays into intact chloroplasts were performed as described previously (32Koussevitzky S. Ne'eman E. Sommer A. Steffens J.C. Harel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27064-27069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The import assay was conducted for 30 min at 25 °C in the light in the presence of 10 mm ATP, unless otherwise indicated. Competition import assays were performed in the presence of nonlabeled pea OEE1 protein, which was expressed and purified as described by Betts et al. (36Betts S.D. Hachigian T.M. Pichersky E. Yocum C.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Following import, chloroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation and then resuspended in HS buffer (50 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8, 0.33 m sorbitol). Each import reaction was divided into 3 aliquots treated with or without thermolysin (0.3 mg/ml) or with thermolysin (0.3 mg/ml) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 45 min at 4 °C. Intact chloroplasts were then re-isolated by centrifugation through a 40% Percoll cushion, washed with HS buffer containing 5 mm EDTA, and resuspended in HS buffer. To localize RB60, we used isolated chloroplasts (10 μg of chlorophyll) or isolated chloroplasts containing imported radioactive rRB60 that were re-isolated using a 40% Percoll cushion and washed with HS buffer containing 5 mm EDTA. Stromal and thylakoid fractions were obtained by freezing and thawing, followed by a 1-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C (37Ostersetzer O. Tabak S. Yarden O. Shapira R. Adam Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant contained the stroma proteins, and the pellet contained the thylakoid fraction. The pellet was washed with 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, and centrifuged as above. Thylakoids were resuspended in 50 μl of wash solution (HS with or without 1 m NaCl or 1m NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, or 0.3 mg/ml thermolysin, or 0.1 m sodium carbonate pH 11, or 10 mm EDTA, or 10 mm DTT) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Membranes were then centrifuged as above for 5 min. The supernatant was saved, and thylakoids were washed with HS buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 μl of HS. For localization and import assays, ∼2 μg chlorophyll was incubated in SDS sample buffer (3% SDS, 2.25% β-mercaptoethanol, 6.7% glycerol, 0.133m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Imported radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Immunoblots were performed according to Trebitsh et al. (23Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with specific antibodies (as detailed in the figure legends) and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (SuperSignal, Pierce). The targeting of proteins synthesized by cytoplasmic ribosomes to the chloroplast is typically determined by an amino-terminal transit peptide. The amino-terminal sequence of RB60, preceding the conserved sequence of PDIs, is quite different from other PDIs in both length and composition (Fig. 1) and contains a putative cleavage sequence in position 26–28 (39Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). To test whether the amino-terminal sequence of rRB60 could direct import into chloroplasts, radiolabeled rRB60 was synthesized in vitro and incubated with C. reinhardtii chloroplasts isolated by Percoll step gradient. Since in contrast to import by the ER, protein uptake by chloroplasts occurs post-translationally, we added the radiolabeled rRB60 only after termination of in vitro translation. Following incubation, protein that had not entered the chloroplast was degraded by treatment with the protease thermolysin. Intact chloroplasts were then repurified on a Percoll cushion and lysed with denaturing buffer, and the protein extracts were fractionated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig.2, rRB60 was imported into the chloroplasts and was protected from protease treatment (Fig. 2,lane 3), similar to a control import reaction containingin vitro synthesized chloroplast LHCII protein (Fig. 2,lane 11). Disruption of chloroplast membranes by treatment with nonionic detergent resulted in the degradation of both imported rRB60 (Fig. 2, lane 4) and LHCII proteins (Fig. 2,lane 12). These results verified the effectiveness of the protease treatment and that the radiolabeled protein was indeed protected from degradation by being taken up into chloroplasts.Figure 2rRB60 is imported into isolated C. reinhardtii chloroplasts. Import into C. reinhardtii chloroplasts was performed with in vitro synthesized, 35S-labeled RB60 (lanes 1–4), Δ28RB60 (a deletion spanning amino acids 1–28) (lanes 5–8), and LHCII (lanes 9–12) recombinant proteins. 2% of the input translation products of RB60 (lane 1), Δ28LRB60 (lane 5), and LHCII (lane 9) is presented. Import into chloroplasts (lanes 2, 6, and10) was protected from thermolysin (0.3 mg/ml) degradation (Therm, lanes 3, 7, and 11). Treatment with 1% Triton X-100 (Triton, lanes 4, 8, and12) ensured that the thermolysin-treated proteins were indeed taken up by chloroplasts. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Molecular masses of reference proteins (kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assay whether the import into chloroplasts was determined by its amino-terminal sequence, a leaderless version of rRB60 (lacking the first 28 amino acids, Δ28RB60) was prepared and subjected to chloroplast import assays. The leaderless rRB60 was not imported by isolated chloroplasts (Fig. 2, lane 7), corroborating the proposed function of the amino-terminal sequence of RB60 as a chloroplast transit peptide required for import into chloroplasts. The mobility of the chloroplast-imported rRB60 was similar to that of itsin vitro translated precursor (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 3), and it corresponded to the mobility of the native RB60 in immunoblot assays (data not shown). In contrast, the mobility of the Δ28RB60 was slightly higher (Fig. 2, lane 5), suggesting that the transit peptide may not be cleaved after import as shown for the thylakoid-associated kinase, TAK1 (40Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Next, we assayed whether rRB60 would also be taken up by the well established system of highly purified pea chloroplasts. We chose pea polyphenol oxidase (Ps-PPO) as a control for the import activity of the isolated pea chloroplasts and C. reinhardtii small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Cr-SSU) as a control for import of a heterologous protein. All proteins were incubated with chloroplasts post-in vitro translation. As seen in the autoradiogram in Fig.3 A, both pea PPO and C. reinhardtii SSU were imported into the chloroplasts and were protected from protease treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and7). Disruption of chloroplast membranes by treating with nonionic detergent resulted in degradation of the imported Ps-PPO and Cr-SSU proteins (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4 and 8). These results demonstrated the intactness and capacity of the isolated pea chloroplasts to import C. reinhardtii chloroplast-targeted proteins in vitro. In a manner comparable to Cr-SSU, rRB60 of C. reinhardtii was imported into the isolated pea chloroplasts, as reflected by its protection from protease degradation in the presence of intact chloroplast membranes (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). As with rRB60 imported into C. reinhardtii chloroplasts (Fig. 2), the mobility of rRB60 imported into pea chloroplasts corresponded to that of its precursor (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 3). The import of rRB60 into pea chloroplasts was dependent upon its amino terminus, as removal of the rRB60 leader abolished import (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and 7). To reaffirm the import of rRB60 into chloroplasts, we tested whether its import exhibits additional characteristics typical of chloroplast import. The findings that the uptake of rRB60 was enhanced in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3 C) and was competed by the pea chloroplast protein OEE1 (Fig. 3 D) corroborate this. To rule out the possibility of contaminating ER in the import reactions, we assayed the purity of the isolated chloroplasts. Fig. 3 E shows that antibodies raised against the tobacco ER protein BiP (41Pedrazzini E. Giovinazzo G. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant J. 1994; 5: 103-110Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reacted against pea BiP in total protein extract of leaves but not of isolated chloroplasts. Similar results were obtained for C. reinhardtii chloroplasts using antibodies raised against the yeast BiP (Fig. 3 E). This indicates that the isolated chloroplasts used were devoid of ER and that rRB60 was taken up by the chloroplasts. The import of rRB60 into both C. reinhardtii and pea chloroplasts suggests that it is directed to chloroplasts in vivo and that this capacity is conserved in higher plants. Import toC. reinhardtii and pea chloroplasts, in a transit peptide-dependent manner, indicated that the nucleus-encoded RB60 contains a chloroplast targeting signal. To identify the subchloroplast localization of native RB60, we lysed isolated C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, and we separated the thylakoid fraction from the supernatant containing the stroma proteins by centrifugation. The purity of the stromal fraction was determined by the absence of thylakoid-associated OEE2 and CF1 proteins, and the purity of the thylakoid fraction was verified by the lack of stromal ClpC protein (Fig. 4 A). RB60 was present in both the stroma and thylakoid fractions of C. reinhardtii chloroplasts (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and3). The proportion of RB60 in these fractions fluctuated in several replications of this assay (data not shown). However, we routinely observed about 50% of the pool of C. reinhardtii chloroplast RB60 to be associated with thylakoids. To check whether following import rRB60 is also directed toward the thylakoid membranes, we assayed the association of imported rRB60 with thylakoids. Both C. reinhardtii and pea chloroplasts containing imported radiolabeled rRB60 were disrupted and fractionated as in Fig. 4 A. Most of the imported rRB60 was found associated with thylakoids of C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, whereas the proportion of soluble rRB60 was higher in pea chloroplasts (Fig. 4 B). Together, these results suggest that at least some of the pool of chloroplast RB60 is associated with thylakoids. Next, we studied the nature of the association between native RB60 andC. reinhardtii thylakoids by washing purified thylakoids with high salt (1 m NaCl) with or without 0.05% Triton X-100, or with alkali buffer (0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11), or by treating with the protease thermolysin (0.1 mg/ml) (Fig.5). Thylakoid membranes were then isolated by centrifugation, and the resistance of thylakoid-associated RB60 to each of these treatments was determined by immunoblot assay comparing the amounts of thylakoid-associated and released soluble RB60. The nature of the association of RB60 with thylakoids was compared with that of the peripheral thylakoid membrane proteins CF1 and OEE2. Similar to CF1 and OEE2, most of the RB60 remained bound to the thylakoids after a wash with 1 m NaCl or 0.1m Na2CO3, pH 11 (Fig. 5,lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7), suggesting that RB60 is tightly bound to the thylakoids. The inclusion of 0.05% Triton X-100 in the salt wash completely removed RB60 from the thylakoids, whereas it had only a mild impact on CF1 and OEE2 (Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that RB60 is a peripheral protein and that its association with thylakoids may be mediated, at least in part, by hydrophobic interactions. The protease treatment removed RB60 exclusively from the thylakoids leaving the CF1 and OEE2 proteins intact (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and 9), suggesting that RB60 is located on the stromal face of the thylakoids. Furthermore, we tested whether imported rRB60 displays the same type of thylakoid association as the native RB60. Following import of radiolabeled rRB60 to C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, thylakoid membranes were challenged with the same treatments as in Fig. 5. Similar to the native RB60 (Fig. 5), most of the imported thylakoid-associated rRB60 was resistant to high salt and alkali washes (Fig. 6, lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7) and sensitive to a wash with 1 m NaCl including 0.05% Triton X-100 (Fig. 6,lanes 4 and 5) and to treatment with thermolysin (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 9). The same type of association with thylakoids was observed with rRB60 imported into pea chloroplasts (Fig. 6, lanes 1–9). Together, these data further corroborate the authenticity of rRB60 and suggest that at least a portion of chloroplast RB60 is tightly bound to the stromal face of the thylakoids. RB60 has been shown to contain reactive thiols (23Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the thylakoid association of RB60 is mediated by formation of a mixed disulfide bond with a thylakoid protein. In this case, the association of RB60 with thylakoids would be expected to be sensitive to reduction. To test this, we washed isolated thylakoids with buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig.7, lanes 2 and 3). The resistance of thylakoid-associated RB60 to reduction by DTT did not corroborate the assumption. RB60 was initially isolated and characterized as a component of a protein complex showing high affinity to the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA (19Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because translation ofpsbA mRNA is by thylakoid-bound polyribosomes (42Harris E.H. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Minami E. Watanabe A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), RB60 may associate with thylakoids by binding to the 5′-UTR of polysomes-associated psbA mRNA. The resistance of the RB60-thylakoid association to a wash with 10 mm EDTA (which dissociates ribosomes) (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5) and to treatment with RNase A (data not shown) indicates otherwise. Therefore, it is conceivable that RB60 associates with thylakoids either directly or as part of a protein complex. RB60 was first isolated as a component of a protein complex (psbA 5′-PC) which assembles with high affinity on the 5′-UTR of C. reinhardtii chloroplast psbA mRNA (19Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Consistent with the predicted location of RB60, antisera raised against RB60 cross-reacted with a single protein in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts (23Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the cloning of rRB60 depicted a PDI-like protein containing a putative amino-terminal leader sequence, whose targeting information was unknown, and an ER-retention signal, -KDEL, at the carboxyl-end of the protein (24Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the authenticity of the recombinant rRB60 by testing whether its amino terminus can direct import by chloroplasts. We showed that rRB60 is imported into both C. reinhardtii and pea chloroplasts in a transit peptide-dependent process (Figs.2 and 3), indicating that RB60 is directed by its amino-terminal sequence to chloroplasts in vivo. The import of rRB60 displayed several characteristics typical of chloroplast import, such as post-translational import, ATP-dependent import, and sensitivity to a competing import of a nonlabeled chloroplast protein (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, B and C). The authenticity of rRB60 was further substantiated by the similar intrachloroplast localization of the native RB60 and the imported rRB60 (Fig. 4). The reason for the presence of a -KDEL signal in the carboxyl terminus of rRB60 is yet unknown. It may be cryptic and may represent a potential signature of the evolution of RB60 from an ancestral PDI gene. Alternatively, RB60 may have dual functions as follows: one in the chloroplast and a second in the ER. Such polytopic proteins, present in both the mitochondrion and an additional cell compartment, have been described (44Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 174-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Polytopic targeting of mitochondrial proteins has been suggested to arise either from export mechanisms from the mitochondria (44Soltys B.J. Gupta R.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 174-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) or, alternatively, via dual targeting by a unique amino terminus signal peptide (45Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Pandak W. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24014-24022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We are currently studying whether RB60 is also an ER protein. In the chloroplast, RB60 is partitioned between the stroma and the thylakoids (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). A second component of psbA 5′-PC, the RB47 protein, has also been shown to be tightly bound to thylakoids (21Zerges W. Rochaix J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The finding of RB60 and RB47 as membrane-associated proteins suggests a regulatory membrane-associated step in the expression ofpsbA mRNA. Translation of chloroplast mRNAs encoding integral thylakoid proteins is via membrane-bound polyribosomes (42Harris E.H. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 700-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Minami E. Watanabe A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that RB60 attaches to thylakoids by binding to the 5′-UTR of polysome-associated psbA mRNA. However, the association of RB60 with thylakoids is resistant to washes containing EDTA and treatment with RNase A, suggesting that the binding is not mediated by membrane-bound ribosomes. This, however, does not rule out the possibility that some amount of RB60 was associated withpsbA mRNA and was washed away from the thylakoids in our Mg2+-free washes. An alternative explanation for the membrane association of 5′-UTR-interacting proteins has been invoked by genetic studies showing many parallels in translational regulation in C. reinhardtii chloroplast and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrion (2Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Hauser C.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,3Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 46Fox T. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the latter, the cox3 mRNA translation activator proteins, PET54, PET122, PET494, form a complex that has the capacity for three-way interaction with the 5′-UTR, the small ribosomal subunit, and the inner mitochondrial membrane (47Brown N.G. Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This three-way association suggests that the yeast translational activators tether the mitochondrion mRNA to the inner membrane (46Fox T. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Similar function has been proposed for the proteins binding the 5′-UTR of chloroplast mRNAs, encoding thylakoid membrane proteins (2Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. Hauser C.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 28: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Rochaix J.-D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The detection of tight binding of RB60 (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) and RB47 (21Zerges W. Rochaix J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to thylakoids corroborates this model. Furthermore, the characterization of RB60 as a peripheral protein localized on the stromal face of the thylakoids (Fig. 5) is consistent with this proposed function of 5′-UTR-binding proteins in the chloroplast. However, thylakoid association is not common to all translational regulators: CRP1, a regulator ofpetA and petD mRNAs in maize, was found to be part of a soluble high molecular weight complex and not to be associated with chloroplast membranes (14Fisk D.G. Walker M.B. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2621-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The finding of specific oxidizing activity of RB60 (23Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) suggests an additional reason for the RB60-thylakoid association. Recently, a novel yeast protein, ERO1, whose function is to oxidize PDI, has been identified and shown to be membrane-localized (48Pollard M.G. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 49Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Likewise, inEscherichia coli, the source of oxidizing equivalents necessary for protein disulfide catalysis has been shown to be membranal electron transport (50Bader M. Muse W. Ballou D.P. Gassner C. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 51Kobayashi T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). By analogy with these studies, one may hypothesize that the photosynthetic electron transport of the thylakoid is the source of oxidizing equivalents for RB60. If so, this might necessitate the close association of RB60 with thylakoids. We thank E.

https://openalex.org/W2068131808,"Effectors involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling modulate activity of GTPases through GTPase-activating protein or guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF). Phospholipase Cδ1 (PLCδ1) is an effector in tissue transglutaminase (TGII)-mediated α<sub>1B</sub>-adrenoreceptor (α<sub>1B</sub>AR) signaling. We investigated whether PLCδ1 modulates TGII activity. PLCδ1 stimulated GDP release from TGII in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in GTPγS binding to TGII. PLCδ1 also inhibited GTP hydrolysis by TGII that was independent from the α<sub>1B</sub>AR. These results indicate that PLCδ1 is GEF for TGII and stabilizes the GTP·TGII complex. When GEF function of PLCδ1 was compared with that of the α<sub>1B</sub>AR, the α<sub>1B</sub>AR-mediated GTPγS binding to TGII was greater than PLCδ1-mediated binding and was accelerated in the presence of PLCδ1. Thus, the α<sub>1B</sub>AR is the prime GEF for TGII, and GEF activity of PLCδ1 promotes coupling efficacy of this signaling system. Overexpression of TGII and its mutants with and without PLCδ1 resulted in an increase in α<sub>1B</sub>AR-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores in a TGII-specific manner. We conclude that PLCδ1 assists the α<sub>1B</sub>AR function through its GEF action and is primarily activated by the coupling of TGII to the cognate receptors."

The amino-terminal signal anchor of TonB and its interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane protein ExbB are essential to this process. The TonB signal anchor is predicted to form an α-helix, with a conserved face comprised of residues Ser16, His20, Leu27, and Ser31. Deletion of either Ser16 or His20 or of individual intervening but not flanking residues rendered TonB inactive and unable to assume a proton motive force-dependent conformation. In vivo formaldehyde cross-linking experiments revealed that the ability of this subset of mutants to form a characteristic heterodimer with ExbB was greatly diminished.

These data indicated that the spatial relationship of Ser16 to His20 was essential to function and suggested that the motif HXXXS defines the minimal requirement for the coupling of TonB to the cytoplasmic membrane electrochemical gradient. Deletion of Trp11 resulted in a TonB that remained active yet was unable to cross-link with ExbB. Because Trp11 was demonstrably not involved in the actual cross-linking, these results suggest that the TonB/ExbB interaction detected by cross-linking occurred at a step in the energy transduction cycle distinct from the coupling of TonB to the electrochemical gradient.

This barrier contains aqueous channels that are formed by general and substrate-specific porin proteins that enable diffusion of small, hydrophilic nutrients (<600 Da in Escherichia coli), across the outer membrane. Simple diffusion is not sufficient for the acquisition of either the nutrient cobalamin or Fe(III)-siderophore complexes. Instead, these nutrients are efficiently harvested at the outer membrane surface by high affinity receptors, which catalyze the active transport of bound ligand into the periplasmic space (1Bradbeer C.

Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The release of cobalamin and Fe(III)-siderophores into the periplasmic space is energy-dependent, requiring an intact proton gradient at the cytoplasmic membrane (4Hancock R.E.W. Braun V. J.

The separation of transport events from their energy source suggests the need for an energy transducer; this need is met by the protein TonB (5Reynolds P.R. Mottur G.P. Bradbeer C. J. Biol.

TonB is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane presumably by a single transmembrane domain (amino acids 12–32), derived from an uncleaved signal sequence (10Postle K. Skare J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11000-11007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the bulk of the protein occupying the periplasmic space (11Hannavy K. Barr G.C. Dorman C.J. Adamson J. Mazengera L.R.

Roughly one-third to one-half of the total cellular TonB partitions exclusively with the outer membrane upon fractionation, suggesting that TonB functions as an intermembrane energy shuttle (15Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The outer membrane components and specific features of TonB that support shuttling to the outer membrane are only defined in part, whereas the requisites for TonB interaction with the cytoplasmic membrane are clear: an intact, wild type signal anchor and the presence of two proteins, ExbB and ExbD (15Letain T.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Both of these integral cytoplasmic membrane proteins physically interact with TonB, as evident by in vivo cross-linking (17Higgs P.I. Myers P.S. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which, in the case of ExbB, appears to involve the TonB signal anchor (18Larsen R.A. Thomas M.T. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The TonB residues Ser16 and His20 occur on a conserved face of the predicted α-helical TonB transmembrane domain (19Koebnik R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 219Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We previously noted that the deletion of a residue (Val17) occurring between the two conserved residues rendered TonB inactive (18Larsen R.A. Thomas M.T. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting either that residue Val17 made a side chain-specific contribution to energy transduction or conversely that the spatial relationship between Ser16 and His20 was essential to function. To resolve this dichotomy, we constructed a series of single residue deletions that spanned the amino-terminal two-thirds of the TonB transmembrane domain. Characterization of the resultant deletion mutants and of several substitution mutants suggested by our initial findings indicated that the positional relationship of Ser16 to His20 was an essential feature for the apparent coupling of TonB to the proton motive force (pmf).1 All bacteria used in this study were derived from the E. coli K-12 strain W3110 (20Hill C.W.

Constructs were mapped for orientation, and inserts were sequenced in entirety to verify identity. The resultant construct (pKP390) used the vector-provided start site to encode an ExbB with an amino terminus containing a valyl and a prolyl residue between the methionine initiation and what would normally be the second residue of ExbB. The second gene in the operon, encoding ExbD, was unaltered by the cloning strategy, retaining its native initiation and termination codons. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in pKP325 and pKP390 by a method adapted from that described by Michael (27Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-412PubMed Google Scholar), wherein a third, 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide primer bearing the desired base changes is introduced into a modified polymerase chain reaction reaction that includes a thermostabile ligase, such that the mutagenic primer is incorporated in the extending strand. In this study, the primers used for amplification flanked two BamHI sites, thus the resultant amplimers could be restricted with BamHI and then reintroduced to the parent vectors cut at these same sites. Because the mutagenic primers were designed to also introduce silent mutations that altered characteristic restriction patterns, products bearing desired mutations could be detected by restriction mapping. Candidates thus identified were further mapped to determine insert orientation, with the inserts ultimately verified by sequencing.

Open table in a new tab Tryptone plates and top agar, and LB broth and agar were made as described (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar). Liquid cultures were grown with aeration at 37 °C in M9 minimal salts; supplemented with 0.4% w/v glycerol, 0.2% vitamin-free casamino acids, 40 μg·ml−1 tryptophan, 0.4 μg·ml−1thiamin, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 1.85 μm iron (provided as FeCl3·6H2O), and l-arabinose as indicated below. For transport assays, vitamin-free casamino acids were replaced by a defined amino acid mix (40 μg·ml−1 each, except aspartic acid and glutamic acid (30 μg·ml−1each), and tyrosine (10 μg·ml−1)) Antibiotics were used where required at a concentration of 100 μg·ml−1for ampicillin and 34 μg·ml−1 for chloramphenicol. In initial cross-linking and proteinase K accessibility experiments, all strains were grown in supplemented M9 containing 67 μml-arabinose to induce tonB expression, which resulted in steady state TonB levels near that of chromosomal controls (i.e. 6–8-fold greater than the noninduced) for all constructs except those encoding deletions at positions 14/15–20, where levels were greater than noninduced but less than the chromosomal control (data not shown). In subsequent experiments Δ16–20 were induced with 130 μml-arabinose, and Δ14/15 with 260 μml-arabinose to attain steady state levels equivalent to or slightly greater than that of chromosomally encoded TonB. α-TonB mAb were prepared as previously described (29Larsen R.A.

Media components were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). l-Arabinose was purchased from Pfanstiehl Laboratories, Inc. (Waukegan, IL). Monomeric formaldehyde was purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). ECL immunoblot kits and [55Fe], provided as iron chloride, were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-α-mouse IgG was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Polyvinylidiene fluoride membranes (Immobilon-P) were purchased from Millipore Corp.

All other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Life Technologies, Inc. Proteinase K, lysozyme, and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cells were grown in supplemented M9 to anA 550 of 0.4 (as determined with a Spectronic 20 spectrophotometer; path length, 1.5 cm), harvested in 100-μl aliquots, suspended in 2 ml of molten top agar (60 °C) containing 1.30 mml-arabinose and antibiotics as appropriate, and overlaid onto room temperature T plates. Serial 10-fold dilutions of bacteriophage φ80vir (initial concentration, 5.5 × 1010 plaque-forming units·ml−1) were applied to the plate surface in 5-μl aliquots and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Results were recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which clearing of the lawn was evident. Cells were grown in supplemented M9 (containing chloramphenicol and arabinose as indicated) to an A 550 of 0.4 and spheroplasts prepared as previously described (18Larsen R.A. Thomas M.T. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The effects of the protonophore CCCP was examined as previously described (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, CCCP (or an equal volume of ethanol carrier) was added to spheroplast suspensions to a final concentration of 50 μm, with samples then incubated with or without proteinase K (25 μg·ml−1) for 15 min at 4 °C, treated for 2 min with 1.0 mmphenymethylsulfonyl fluoride to inactivate the proteinase, and then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and processed as described (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in supplemented M9 (containing antibiotics and arabinose as indicated) to an A 550 of 0.4, harvested in 1.0-ml aliquots, centrifuged, and suspended in 938 μl of room temperature 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), followed by the addition of 62 μl of fresh 16% formaldehyde monomer. Suspensions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, centrifuged, suspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, incubated for 5 min at 60 °C, and then stored at −20 °C until analysis. Samples prepared as above were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS 11% polyacrylamide gels, and the resolved proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidiene fluoride membranes. Immunoblot analyses were subsequently performed using TonB-specific mAbs and ECL, as previously described (30Larsen R.A. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Ferrichrome transport assays were adapted from a study by Köster and Braun (31Köster W. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The strain KP1351 (ΔtonB,aroB), carrying either a control plasmid (pACYC184), or plasmids encoding either wild type TonB (pKP325) or TonBVCI17–19AAA (pKP441) was grown to anA 550 of 0.5 in supplemented M9 salts with chloramphenicol, defined amino acids, and 67 μml-arabinose. Cells were centrifuged and then suspended to 2 × 108 colony-forming units ·ml−1 in M9 salts containing 0.1 mmnitrilotriacetate, followed by incubation with shaking for 5 min. at 30 °C. Samples of 0.5 ml were removed and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid preparative to electrophoresis. Transport was initiated by the addition of 150 pmol of [55Fe]ferrichrome (generated by preincubation of deferriferrichrome with [55Fe]Cl3 at a 6.7:1 molar ratio in 10 mm HCl at 37 °C for 15 min) to 2 × 108 colony-forming units, with incubation continued by shaking at 30 °C. Samples of 0.5 ml were harvested at the indicated time points by filtration onto glass filters, which were then washed three times with 5 ml of 0.1 m LiCl and dried. Incorporated [55Fe] was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Certain bacteriophage and colicins have evolved to exploit the TonB-dependent transport system to gain entry into E. coli (32Matsushiro A. Virology. 1963; 19: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Davies J.K. Reeves P. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 123: 96-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their toxicity provides indirect assays for TonB function. In this study, the activity of TonB proteins carrying single residue deletions in the transmembrane domain was assayed by spot titer against the TonB-dependent bacteriophage φ80. Every attempt was made to express the plasmid-encoded proteins at chromosomal levels. TonB-encoding plasmids and controls were carried in the tonB deletion strain KP1344, with TonB expression induced by the presence of 1.3 mml-arabinose in the top agar. All assays were performed in triplicate. Because this is a solid phase assay, direct determination of expression levels is problematic; however, this concentration of l-arabinose resulted in a level of activity for wild type plasmid-encoded TonB (pKP325) that was indistinguishable from that obtained with the chromosomally encoded TonB of W3110 (in each case clearing/plaque formation was evident at the 10−8 dilution; data not shown). In the absence of induction, clearing/plaque formation with plasmid-encoded wild type TonB was reduced 10-fold (data not shown). In a prior study (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), induction with higher levels of l-arabinose resulted in a similar reduction of activity for wild type TonB, presumably a dominant negative gene dosage effect. Thus, although we do not presume that the levels of TonB achieved in this assay precisely match that encoded by the chromosome, any activity differences caused by variation in expression level were less than the resolving power of this assay, with one possible exception as described below. This noted, the effects of single residue deletion, when present, were unambiguous (Fig.1). Deletion of single residues from both positions 10–14/15 and positions 21–23/24 of TonB had no detectable impact on sensitivity to φ80. Conversely, single residue deletions in the region of positions 16–20 completely eliminated TonB activity, with the exception of ΔV17, where slight clearing with undiluted phage (∼2.75 × 108 plaque-forming units) was evident in two of three cases (Fig. 1). We have previously found chromosomally encoded TonBΔV17 to be completely inactive in this assay, with traces of activity evident upon overexpression (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that in the present assay TonBΔV17 was somewhat overexpressed relative to chromosomally encoded TonB. We had previously demonstrated that the conformation of TonB varies with the presence or absence of pmf (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Comparison of spheroplasts in the presence and absence of a protonophore (CCCP or dinitrophenol) revealed that upon collapse of the cytoplasmic membrane proton gradient, wild type TonB acquires a distinct conformation wherein the amino-terminal 152–156 residues exhibit an enhanced resistance to digestion by proteinase K. This ability to respond to pmf changes is dependent upon the presence of ExbB/D and is lost upon mutation of either TonB residues Ser16 or His20 or the deletion of residue Val17 (16Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1809-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, identical assays of pmf responsiveness were performed on the present deletion series (Fig.2). The results obtained paralleled those of the φ80 spot titer assays (Fig. 1), with proteins bearing single residue deletions involving positions 16–20 rendered unresponsive to pmf, whereas proteins with deletions on either flank of this region (residues 10–14/15 and 21–23/24) retained pmf responsiveness (Fig.2). In addition, each TonB derivative examined was susceptible to proteinase K in spheroplasts, indicating that negative phenotypes did not merely reflect improper secretion. Wild type TonB can be cross-linkedin vivo with formaldehyde to form a set of characteristic higher molecular mass complexes that includes a TonB·FepA complex that migrates with an apparent mass of 195 kDa, a cluster of uncharacterized complexes that migrate at 77 kDa, an additional unidentified complex that migrates at 43.5 kDa (13Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seacord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a TonB·ExbB heterodimer with an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa (13Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seacord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Higgs P.I. Myers P.S. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6031-6038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies with TonBΔV17 indicated that the mutant could not form a detectable cross-linked complex with ExbB upon formaldehyde treatment yet retained the ability to form the other characteristic complexes (18Larsen R.A. Thomas M.T. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These experiments were extended here to include the entire set of single residue deletions (Fig.3). Several minor deviations in the cross-linking profile were evident, including variations in the signal intensity of the several bands comprising the 77-kDa cluster of the Δ14/15-Δ20 mutants, increased signal intensity of the 43.5-kDa complex for the Δ13-Δ20 mutants, and the appearance of a novel 66-kDa complex (indicated by the arrow in the right panel) for the Δ17-Δ19 mutants. Because the non-TonB components of these complexes are not as yet determined, the implications of these differences were unclear. More readily interpretable were the effects of the mutations on the ability of TonB to form the 59-kDa heterodimer with ExbB. These results paralleled the results of the activity and pmf responsiveness assays, with the ability of the Δ16-Δ20 mutants to form the characteristic cross-linked complex with ExbB greatly diminished or absent. This phenotype was also evident with the Δ14/15 mutant and, surprisingly, with the Δ11 mutant. Preliminary studies 2R. A. Larsen and K. Postle, unpublished observations. suggest the inability to detect cross-linked complexes of the Δ14/15 mutant with ExbB may be related to its apparent instability (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because tryptophan 11 is theoretically formaldehyde-reactive, the inability to detect cross-linked complexes of the Δ11 mutant with ExbB suggested the possibility that the actual cross-linking occurred through this residue. To test this possibility, two additional mutations were generated. First, the Trp11residue of TonB was conservatively replaced by phenylalanine, a residue nonreactive with formaldehyde. Second, Trp38 of ExbB was replaced with a phenylalanine, because topological comparisons suggested that this was the nearest formaldehyde-reactive residue with which TonB Trp11 could interact. The TonB activity of strains carrying one or both of these alleles, as determined by spot titer assays, was indistinguishable from wild type (data not shown). Alleles were paired and evaluated by in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, replacement of TonB Trp11 with a nonreactive residue did not result in the loss of formaldehyde-mediated cross-linking of TonB to ExbB. Similarly, ExbBW38F did not lose the ability to cross-link to TonB; however, the relative amount of complex formed appeared to be diminished with both wild type TonB and TonBW11F.Figure 4In vivo chemical formaldehyde cross-linking of the Δ tonB, exbB::Tn10 strain KP1304 expressing plasmid-encoded wild type (wt) TonB or TonBW11F paired with wild type ExbB, ExbBW38F, or the parent plasmid of the ExbB derivatives.

Recently, Kahn and colleagues (21Kahn A. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Mitanchez D. Doiron B. Chen R. Kahn A. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 520-540PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a signaling pathway model to explain the molecular mechanism by which glucose regulates the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase. This model consists of the following details: (i) the presence of glucose is sensed in the cell; (ii) this information is transduced by intracellular messengers; (iii) a second messenger, presumably xylulose 5-phosphate, rises and then modulates the activity of protein kinase and protein phosphatase involved in a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. This cascade then leads to a modification of the phosphorylation state of the glucose-responsive complex, followed by an increase in the transcriptional rate of the target gene. In this model, the presence of an active glucokinase that phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is paramount.The molecular mechanism by which glucose regulates the expression of the Glc-6-Pase gene is currently unknown. Here we show that glucose regulation of the expression of this gene involves metabolism of glucose through the glycolytic pathway, transcriptional activation of the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter, and a decrease in the degradation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA.DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms underlying glucose-induced regulation of the Glc-6-Pase gene is not clearly understood. Here we present evidence that stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by glucose involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components. The specific DNA sequence(s) responsible for the transcriptional response remains to be established. The half-life of Glc-6-Pase mRNA was found to be 90 min. The fact that glucose prolongs this half-life suggests glucose-induced stabilization of the Glc-6-Pase mRNA. New protein synthesis does not seem to be necessary for glucose to induce Glc-6-Pase mRNA. This would argue against a mechanism whereby glucose stimulated the synthesis of a protein factor(s) that bind to the mRNA and thereby prevent its degradation. The stabilization of the Glc-6-Pase mRNA by glucose does not depend on the ability of this mRNA to be translated, since the 2-fold increase in the level of Glc-6-Pase protein was much lower than the increase in its mRNA. It has been extensively documented that mRNAs whose 3′-UTRs contain an AU-rich element (AURE) and/or an oligonucleotide (U) tend to be unstable (36Caput D. Beutle R.B. Hartog K. Thayer R.

Whether these AUREs play any role in Glc-6-Pase mRNA stability is not known.One unresolved question about the glucose-induced accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA is whether this effect requires glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway. If this pathway is important for the effect, then suppressing it should be expected to prevent the accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA. Glucose-induced accumulation of the mRNA for Glc-6-Pase was indeed prevented when hepatocytes were incubated with 0.2 mm 6-AN. When metabolized to 6-amino-NAD and 6-amino-NADP, this nucleotide behaves as a competitive inhibitor of NAD(P+)-requiring dehydrogenases that would include G6PDH, 6-PGDH, and glutathione reductase (32Downs S.M.

Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). 6-Amino-NADP is an extremely potent competitive inhibitor of 6-PGDH, and concentrations that do not affect G6PDH may completely block 6-PGDH (43Kohler E. Barrach H.-J. Neubert D. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no inhibition of NAD-dependent enzymes results from the use of this compound (48Coper H. Neubert D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of glycolysis from glucose by 6-AN makes it difficult to interpret the results using glucose as an energy source. Nevertheless, this compound is very valuable to study the effect of substrates such as fructose and glycerol that enter glycolysis beyond the formation of fructose 6-phosphate.When both the pentose phosphate pathway and phosphoglucoisomerase were inhibited with 6-AN and oxythiamine, stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by fructose or glycerol was not affected. These two substrates enter the glycolytic pathway at the level of triose phosphate(s), and the fact that the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway was blocked suggests that the pentose phosphate pathway is not required for the glucose effect on the Glc-6-Pase gene. In contrast to glucose, xylitol induced Glc-6-Pase mRNA even in the presence of inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway. Taken together, these results support the idea that xylitol and glucose signal through different pathways.The signaling pathway from glucose to the DNA sequences termed carbohydrate responsive element (ChoRE/GIRE) is not totally characterized. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of transcription factors have been implicated in the glucose responsiveness of many genes. Xylulose 5-phosphate, produced by the pentose phosphate pathway, has been suggested as a secondary messenger in sensing glucose concentration in the hepatocyte. This proposal stems from the fact that xylitol, a precursor of xylulose 5-phosphate, is able to stimulate the expression of a number of genes, both in vivo (12Massillon D. Chen W. Barzilai N.

The same phosphatase is also involved in the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1 (51Alberts A.S. Deng T. Lin A. Meinkoth J.L. Schonthal A. Mumby M.C. Karin M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, glucose-induced transcription of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene is mediated by the transcription factor Sp1 (52Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol.

This stimulation is prevented by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A (52Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol.

On the other hand, okadaic acid only partially inhibits the action of glucose and xylitol to stimulate the fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (53Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 1075-1085Google Scholar). These results suggest that either dephosphorylation of Sp1 is not universal in the glucose signaling pathway or that glucose signaling also involves other transcription factors such as the upstreamstimulatory factor proteins (54Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These upstream stimulatory factor proteins were among the first transcription factors suggested to link glucose action to the ChoRE/GIRE (54Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M Martinez A. Antoine B.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The involvement of protein phosphatase(s) in the modulation of transcription factors involved in glucose signaling is worth exploring further.The metabolic consequences of increased Glc-6-Pase gene expression by glucose are not known. More than 25 years ago, Nordlie and colleagues (47Nordlie R.C. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis, Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 93-152Google Scholar) proposed the controversial idea that Glc-6-Pase, in the presence of high glucose levels, might act as a phosphotransferase that uses carbamoyl phosphate as the phosphate donor. Whether Glc-6-Pase plays any role in glucose phosphorylation is debatable. Nonetheless, the paradoxical induction of Glc-6-Pase gene by glucose points toward a potential role of this enzyme in the removal of glucose from the circulation. Glucose stimulation might also be needed to make sure that the enzyme does not disappear when the cell shifts from fed to starved conditions. One speculation is that glucose stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene may take place in vivo when glucose cycling is needed following hyperglycemia. Glc-6-Pase is a very complex protein with different protein components that are not yet well characterized. Glc-6-Pase1 (EC 3.1.3.9) is a multicomponent protein complex comprising catalytic and transporting entities (1Sukalski K.A. Nordlie R.C. Adv. Enzymol. 1989; 62: 93-117PubMed Google Scholar, 2Nordlie R.C. Bode A.M. Foster J.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 203: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Arion W.J. Lange A.J.

The complex is tightly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and the enzymatic component catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose, a final common step to both the pathways of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Hepatic Glc-6-Pase activity is effectively regulated by hormonal and nutritional status. For example, fasting and hormones that increase cAMP concentration stimulate its gene expression while re-feeding and insulin decrease it (1Sukalski K.A. Nordlie R.C. Adv.

The expression of the genes for several other proteins is regulated by glucose; these include genes for L-type pyruvate kinase (13Munnich A. Marie J. Reach G. Vaulont S. Simon M. Kahn A. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 314: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which glucose regulates the expression of these genes remains largely unknown. Recently, Kahn and colleagues (21Kahn A. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Mitanchez D. Doiron B. Chen R. Kahn A. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 520-540PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed a signaling pathway model to explain the molecular mechanism by which glucose regulates the expression of the L-type pyruvate kinase. This model consists of the following details: (i) the presence of glucose is sensed in the cell; (ii) this information is transduced by intracellular messengers; (iii) a second messenger, presumably xylulose 5-phosphate, rises and then modulates the activity of protein kinase and protein phosphatase involved in a cascade of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. This cascade then leads to a modification of the phosphorylation state of the glucose-responsive complex, followed by an increase in the transcriptional rate of the target gene. In this model, the presence of an active glucokinase that phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) is paramount. The molecular mechanism by which glucose regulates the expression of the Glc-6-Pase gene is currently unknown. Here we show that glucose regulation of the expression of this gene involves metabolism of glucose through the glycolytic pathway, transcriptional activation of the Glc-6-Pase gene promoter, and a decrease in the degradation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA. DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms underlying glucose-induced regulation of the Glc-6-Pase gene is not clearly understood. Here we present evidence that stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by glucose involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional components. The specific DNA sequence(s) responsible for the transcriptional response remains to be established. The half-life of Glc-6-Pase mRNA was found to be 90 min. The fact that glucose prolongs this half-life suggests glucose-induced stabilization of the Glc-6-Pase mRNA. New protein synthesis does not seem to be necessary for glucose to induce Glc-6-Pase mRNA. This would argue against a mechanism whereby glucose stimulated the synthesis of a protein factor(s) that bind to the mRNA and thereby prevent its degradation. The stabilization of the Glc-6-Pase mRNA by glucose does not depend on the ability of this mRNA to be translated, since the 2-fold increase in the level of Glc-6-Pase protein was much lower than the increase in its mRNA. It has been extensively documented that mRNAs whose 3′-UTRs contain an AU-rich element (AURE) and/or an oligonucleotide (U) tend to be unstable (36Caput D. Beutle R.B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Such AURE in the 3′-UTR had been found in transcripts such as c-fos and c-myc (37Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 38You Y. Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are known to have a short half-life. Their significance in mRNA turnover has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro (38You Y. Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cleveland D.W.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6302-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of the Glc-6-Pase gene contains a few AUREs. Whether these AUREs play any role in Glc-6-Pase mRNA stability is not known.One unresolved question about the glucose-induced accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA is whether this effect requires glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway. If this pathway is important for the effect, then suppressing it should be expected to prevent the accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA. Glucose-induced accumulation of the mRNA for Glc-6-Pase was indeed prevented when hepatocytes were incubated with 0.2 mm 6-AN.

Neubert D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). 6-Amino-NADP is an extremely potent competitive inhibitor of 6-PGDH, and concentrations that do not affect G6PDH may completely block 6-PGDH (43Kohler E. Barrach H.-J. Neubert D. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no inhibition of NAD-dependent enzymes results from the use of this compound (48Coper H. Neubert D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of glycolysis from glucose by 6-AN makes it difficult to interpret the results using glucose as an energy source.

The stabilization of the Glc-6-Pase mRNA by glucose does not depend on the ability of this mRNA to be translated, since the 2-fold increase in the level of Glc-6-Pase protein was much lower than the increase in its mRNA. It has been extensively documented that mRNAs whose 3′-UTRs contain an AU-rich element (AURE) and/or an oligonucleotide (U) tend to be unstable (36Caput D. Beutle R.B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Such AURE in the 3′-UTR had been found in transcripts such as c-fos and c-myc (37Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 38You Y. Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are known to have a short half-life. Their significance in mRNA turnover has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro (38You Y. Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Cleveland D.W. Yen T.J. New Biol. 1989; 1: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bohjanen P.R. Petrymiak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6302-6309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of the Glc-6-Pase gene contains a few AUREs. Whether these AUREs play any role in Glc-6-Pase mRNA stability is not known. One unresolved question about the glucose-induced accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA is whether this effect requires glucose metabolism through the pentose phosphate pathway. If this pathway is important for the effect, then suppressing it should be expected to prevent the accumulation of Glc-6-Pase mRNA. Glucose-induced accumulation of the mRNA for Glc-6-Pase was indeed prevented when hepatocytes were incubated with 0.2 mm 6-AN. When metabolized to 6-amino-NAD and 6-amino-NADP, this nucleotide behaves as a competitive inhibitor of NAD(P+)-requiring dehydrogenases that would include G6PDH, 6-PGDH, and glutathione reductase (32Downs S.M.

Neubert D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). 6-Amino-NADP is an extremely potent competitive inhibitor of 6-PGDH, and concentrations that do not affect G6PDH may completely block 6-PGDH (43Kohler E. Barrach H.-J. Neubert D. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no inhibition of NAD-dependent enzymes results from the use of this compound (48Coper H. Neubert D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 89: 23-32PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of glycolysis from glucose by 6-AN makes it difficult to interpret the results using glucose as an energy source. Nevertheless, this compound is very valuable to study the effect of substrates such as fructose and glycerol that enter glycolysis beyond the formation of fructose 6-phosphate. When both the pentose phosphate pathway and phosphoglucoisomerase were inhibited with 6-AN and oxythiamine, stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by fructose or glycerol was not affected. These two substrates enter the glycolytic pathway at the level of triose phosphate(s), and the fact that the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway was blocked suggests that the pentose phosphate pathway is not required for the glucose effect on the Glc-6-Pase gene. In contrast to glucose, xylitol induced Glc-6-Pase mRNA even in the presence of inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway. Taken together, these results support the idea that xylitol and glucose signal through different pathways. The signaling pathway from glucose to the DNA sequences termed carbohydrate responsive element (ChoRE/GIRE) is not totally characterized. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of transcription factors have been implicated in the glucose responsiveness of many genes. Xylulose 5-phosphate, produced by the pentose phosphate pathway, has been suggested as a secondary messenger in sensing glucose concentration in the hepatocyte. This proposal stems from the fact that xylitol, a precursor of xylulose 5-phosphate, is able to stimulate the expression of a number of genes, both in vivo (12Massillon D. Chen W. Barzilai N. Prus-Wertheimer D. Hawkins M. Liu R. Taub R. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 228-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in cultured cells (26Doiron B.

The same phosphatase is also involved in the dephosphorylation of the transcription factor Sp1 (51Alberts A.S. Deng T. Lin A. Meinkoth J.L. Schonthal A. Mumby M.C. Karin M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell.

Xylulose 5-phosphate-activated phosphatase is also activated by glucose or a glucose metabolite (50Liu Y.Q. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8824-8830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glucose-induced transcription of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene is mediated by the transcription factor Sp1 (52Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This stimulation is prevented by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase types 1 and 2A (52Daniel S. Zhang S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On the other hand, okadaic acid only partially inhibits the action of glucose and xylitol to stimulate the fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase:fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (53Dupriez V.J. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 1075-1085Google Scholar). These results suggest that either dephosphorylation of Sp1 is not universal in the glucose signaling pathway or that glucose signaling also involves other transcription factors such as the upstreamstimulatory factor proteins (54Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These upstream stimulatory factor proteins were among the first transcription factors suggested to link glucose action to the ChoRE/GIRE (54Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 55Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The involvement of protein phosphatase(s) in the modulation of transcription factors involved in glucose signaling is worth exploring further. The metabolic consequences of increased Glc-6-Pase gene expression by glucose are not known. More than 25 years ago, Nordlie and colleagues (47Nordlie R.C. Hanson R.W. Mehlman M.A. Gluconeogenesis, Its Regulation in Mammalian Species. John Wiley & Sons, New York1976: 93-152Google Scholar) proposed the controversial idea that Glc-6-Pase, in the presence of high glucose levels, might act as a phosphotransferase that uses carbamoyl phosphate as the phosphate donor. Whether Glc-6-Pase plays any role in glucose phosphorylation is debatable. Nonetheless, the paradoxical induction of Glc-6-Pase gene by glucose points toward a potential role of this enzyme in the removal of glucose from the circulation. Glucose stimulation might also be needed to make sure that the enzyme does not disappear when the cell shifts from fed to starved conditions. One speculation is that glucose stimulation of Glc-6-Pase gene may take place in vivo when glucose cycling is needed following hyperglycemia. Glc-6-Pase is a very complex protein with different protein components that are not yet well characterized. I thank Dr. Richard W. Hanson for the use of his laboratory during the performance of much of this work. I also thank Frederic Bone for excellent assistance in various phases of this work and Dr. Ifeanyi J.

GTP-bound Cdc42 has been shown to facilitate neurite outgrowth elicited by activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs). Because tyrosine kinase activity is a requirement for neuritogenesis in several cell systems, we investigated whether endogenous mAChRs (principally of the M3 subtype) expressed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells would signal to ACK-1. Incubation of cells with the cholinergic agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) induced an approximately 6-fold increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 which was inhibited by atropine. ACK-1 phosphorylation was blocked by Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of Rho family GTPases. In contrast, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D stimulated ACK-1 phosphorylation, and moreover, addition of Oxo-M to cells preincubated with this agent elicited a further increase in phosphorylation, indicating that an intact cytoskeleton is not required for mAChR signaling to ACK-1. Although stimulation of M3 mAChRs induces both an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), neither of these second messenger pathways was required for receptor-stimulated ACK-1 phosphorylation. Instead, inhibition of PKC resulted in a 2-fold increase in Oxo-M-stimulated ACK-1 phosphorylation, whereas acute activation of PKC with phorbol ester decreased ACK-1 phosphorylation. The agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 was blocked by inhibitors of Src family kinases, and ACK-1 was coprecipitated with Fyn (but not Src) in an agonist-dependent manner. Finally, scrape loading cells with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of either the Fyn-SH2 or Fyn-SH3 domain significantly attenuated mAChR-stimulated ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. The data are the first to show phosphorylation of ACK-1 after stimulation of a receptor coupled to neurite outgrowth and indicate that a Rho family GTPase (i.e. Cdc42) and Fyn are essential upstream elements of this signaling pathway.

Synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in the development of the central nervous system and in mediating the processes of learning and memory. The phenomena of long term potentiation and long term depression are considered in vitro models of the latter (1Malenka R.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 535-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for tyrosine kinase activity in mediating both long term potentiation in the hippocampus and long term depression in the cerebellum (2O'Dell T.J.

Furthermore, tyrosine kinase activity has also been shown to play a prominent role in facilitating neurite outgrowth in several in vitro models (4Williams E.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J.

Currently, ∼100 protein tyrosine kinases have been identified (6Hunter T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 583-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These enzymes can be categorized into two distinct classes, receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Examples of receptor tyrosine kinases include classical growth factor receptors such as the receptor for nerve growth factor (7Klesse L.J. Parada L.F. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases consist of approximately 10 families including two related families, the activated Cdc42Hs-associated kinase (ACK)1family and the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) family (8Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the ACK and FAK families are highly expressed in the brain (9Manser E. Leung T.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8524-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ACK-1 is one of two known members of the ACK family and was originally cloned from a human hippocampal cDNA library (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). ACK-1 is a specific downstream effector of the Rho family small molecular weight GTPase Cdc42. In contrast to many effectors that also act as GTPase-activating proteins for their partner G proteins, the association of ACK-1 with GTP-bound Cdc42 has been shown toinhibit both the intrinsic and GTPase-activating protein-stimulated GTPase activity of Cdc42, suggesting that this interaction may sustain Cdc42 in a GTP-bound (active) state (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Active Cdc42 promotes the formation of filopodial extensions and actin microspikes (15Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

These changes in actin cytoskeletal structure are mediated via activation of other Cdc42 effectors, such as the p21-activated kinases (17Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem.

In particular, Rac and Cdc42 facilitate neurite outgrowth, whereas Rho induces neurite retraction and growth cone collapse (23Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Cholinergic transmission is a critical element involved in the maintenance of cognitive functions in the central nervous system such as learning and memory (26Winkler J. Suhr S.T. Gage F.H. Thal L.J. Fisher L.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For example, deficits in muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) signaling contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and other types of age-related dementia (27Levey A.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13541-13546Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28Avery E.E. Baker L.D. Asthana S.

SH-SY5Y cells express a high density of mAChRs, principally of the M3 subtype (32Lambert D.G. Ghataorre A.S. Nahorski S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 165: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 33Wall S.J. Yasuda R.P. Li M. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 783-789PubMed Google Scholar), which are coupled to the phospholipase C-dependent production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate andsn-1,2-diacylglycerol (34Lambert D.G.

Res. 1994; 19: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These second messenger molecules lead to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. Stimulation of mAChRs on SH-SY5Y cells has been shown to elicit morphological changes characteristic of neurite outgrowth (36Rösner H. Vacun G. Rebhan M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 324-334PubMed Google Scholar, 37Linseman D.A. Hofmann F. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2010-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and induces a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase FAK (38Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given that Cdc42 has been shown to regulate mAChR-mediated growth cone remodeling (23Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), we investigated whether mAChR stimulation in SH-SY5Y cells couples to activation of the Cdc42 effector ACK-1. The results demonstrate that agonist occupancy of mAChRs on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells elicits an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 which is dependent on Cdc42 function, Fyn tyrosine kinase activity, and an interaction between ACK-1 and Fyn. The last may require both the Fyn-SH2 and Fyn-SH3 domains. The results are the first to show a receptor-mediated activation of ACK-1 in a neuronal cell system and support a role for this nonreceptor tyrosine kinase in signaling during growth cone remodeling.

After removal of the plating medium, confluent cultures of SH-SY5Y cells were washed once with 2 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) treatment buffer consisting of 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mmNaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) and allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C in 1 ml of treatment buffer for 20 min. During the equilibration period cells were preincubated with inhibitors as described in this paper. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 24 h in culture medium containing toxin B prior to agonist exposure, as described previously (37Linseman D.A. Hofmann F. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2010-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated for the specified duration at 37 °C with either buffer or 1 mm Oxo-M. After incubation, the buffer was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed once with 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated on ice and scraped into lysis buffer (200 μl/well) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 3 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a commercially available protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Aliquots (∼350 μg) of supernatant protein were diluted to a final volume of 500 μl with lysis buffer and transferred to tubes containing either 2 μg of polyclonal anti-ACK-1 or 2 μg of polyclonal anti-FAK. In some experiments, varying amounts of the ACK-1 blocking peptide were included during immunoprecipitation. Samples were then incubated with mixing for 16–20 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of agarose-conjugated protein A/G was added for an additional 4 h with mixing. Immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The final agarose pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed through 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Cells were incubated for 5 min with either buffer or Oxo-M and lysed as described above. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of either polyclonal anti-ACK-1 or monoclonal anti-Src or anti-Fyn. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and processed for immunoblot analysis. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Primary monoclonal antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (final concentration of 0.5–1.0 μg/ml) and incubated with the membranes for 1 h. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes three times in PBS-T. The blots were then incubated in peroxidase-conjugated, anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted in PBS-T (1:10,000) for 1 h and subsequently washed three times in PBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some experiments, membranes were reprobed after stripping in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 52 °C. The blots were rinsed twice in PBS-T and processed as above with a different primary antibody. Autoluminograms shown are representative of two to four independent experiments. Quantitative analysis of autoluminograms was performed by computer-assisted imaging densitometry (MCID; Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Cells were incubated to isotopic equilibrium at 37 °C in 1 ml of phosphate-free treatment buffer containing 1 mCi/ml 32Pi for 4 h. The labeling solution was aspirated, and unincorporated32Pi was removed by washing three times with 2 ml of the same buffer. The cells were then incubated with either vehicle, Oxo-M or PMA, as described in the legend to Fig. 4, and either ACK-1 or MARCKS was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes.32P-Labeled proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Cyclone Storage Phosphor System; Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT). Membranes containing ACK-1 immunoprecipitates were subsequently immunoblotted for Tyr(P) as described above. Either GST alone or GST fusion proteins (Fyn-SH2 or Fyn-SH3) were scrape loaded into cells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in scrape-loading buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 114 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, and 5.5 mm MgCl2 (39Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar). Scrape-loaded cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of the fusion proteins, and then the cells were pelleted, resuspended in serum-free medium, and seeded into 35-mm culture dishes. After further incubation at 37 °C in 10% CO2 for 3 h, the cells had reattached and were incubated with either buffer or Oxo-M for 5 min. ACK-1 immune complexes were isolated and probed for Tyr(P). The post-ACK-1 immunoprecipitate lysates were also resolved by SDS-PAGE and were probed for GST to estimate the efficiency of scrape loading. Results shown represent the means ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated using Student's two-tailed ttests. Incubation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the cholinergic agonist Oxo-M elicited a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 (6.2 ± 0.7-fold increase over basal, n = 6, p < 0.001, Fig. 1 A, first lane versus second lane). Immunoprecipitation of ACK-1 was competitively antagonized by coincubation with a blocking peptide that mimicked the antigenic site on ACK-1 (Fig. 1 A). Agonist-stimulated ACK-1 phosphorylation was blocked by preincubation with the muscarinic selective antagonist, atropine, but was unaffected by the nicotinic selective antagonist, mecamylamine (Fig.1 B). The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 elicited by Oxo-M was time- and dose-dependent. The agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of ACK-1 was rapid and persistent, increasing within 1 min of agonist exposure, peaking at 5–10 min, and remaining elevated above the basal level for at least 1 h (Fig.1 C). Furthermore, Oxo-M induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 with an EC50 of ∼100 μm (Fig.1 D, upper panel). The addition of agonist had no effect on the immunoprecipitation efficiency of ACK-1 (Fig.1 D, lower panel). ACK-1 has been shown to interact specifically with the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To determine whether the mAChR-induced increase in ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on Cdc42 activity, cells were preincubated with C. difficile toxin B. Toxin B is a monoglucosyltransferase that selectively inhibits the function of Rho family GTPases (40Just I. Seizer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). After 24 h of incubation with toxin B, the subsequent C3 exoenzyme-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Rho proteins in SH-SY5Y cell lysates is significantly decreased, a result indicating that toxin B efficiently enters intact SH-SY5Y cells and inhibits Rho family GTPases in these cells (37Linseman D.A. Hofmann F. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2010-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, SH-SY5Y cells become rounded, and a marked disruption of the actin cytoskeleton is observed after incubation with toxin B (37Linseman D.A. Hofmann F. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2010-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The latter morphology is characteristic of cells in which Rho family GTPase function has been compromised (40Just I. Seizer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Preincubation with toxin B essentially abolished the agonist-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 (Fig.2 A), a result consistent with a requirement for Cdc42 function in signaling from the M3mAChR to ACK-1. The ACK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (9Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) shows some homology to the FAK family, which includes two principal members, FAK and PYK-2 (11Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 41Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

Stimulation of an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation status of either FAK or PYK-2 requires an intact actin cytoskeleton (39Flinn H.M. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1133-1141PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. German B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effects of the actin cytoskeleton-destabilizing agent cytochalasin D on mAChR-stimulated ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. After a 30-min preincubation with cytochalasin D, SH-SY5Y cells displayed a significant disruption of actin stress fibers (results not shown). As documented previously (38Linseman D.A. McEwen E.L. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), cytochalasin D pretreatment suppressed the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and completely inhibited the mAChR-induced increase in FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). In contrast, the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 was increased dramatically after incubation with cytochalasin D, and the agonist-induced increase in ACK-1 phosphorylation was sustained after disruption of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Interestingly, the ability of cytochalasin D to enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 was blunted significantly by preincubation with toxin B (Fig. 2 C). Thus, an intact actin cytoskeleton is not required for mAChR signaling to ACK-1, and moreover, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton promotes ACK-1 phosphorylation via a mechanism involving Rho family GTPase activity. Agonist occupancy of M3 mAChRs leads to the phospholipase C-dependent generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate andsn-1,2-diacylglycerol which, in turn, increase intracellular Ca2+ and activate PKC, respectively. Given that increases in intracellular Ca2+ and/or PKC activity can elicit an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of either PYK-2 or FAK (42Brinson A.E. Harding T. Diliberto P.A. He Y. Li X. Hunter D. German B. Earp H.S. Graves L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43Linseman D.A. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1933-1944PubMed Google Scholar), the potential involvement of these second messengers in mAChR signaling to ACK-1 was investigated. First, the effects of depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores on agonist-induced ACK-1 phosphorylation were assessed. As described previously (44Slowiejko D.M. Levey A.I. Fisher S.K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a 30-min preincubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 1 μm thapsigargin completely abolished the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ observed after mAChR stimulation. However, thapsigargin pretreatment did not have a statistically significant effect on agonist-induced ACK-1 phosphorylation (690 ± 296% increase in control versus 426 ± 194% increase in thapsigargin-treated, n = 4,p = 0.48, data not shown). This result suggests that agonist-induced Ca2+ release does not play a significant role in mAChR signaling to ACK-1. Next, we evaluated the effects of agents that modulate PKC activity on mAChR-stimulated ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Preincubation with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, resulted in a statistically significant 2-fold increase in the mAChR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, activation of PKC, via an acute preincubation with phorbol ester, significantly inhibited agonist-stimulated ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by ∼50% (Fig. 3, A and B). This latter inhibitory effect of PMA on ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was prevented by preincubation with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that, in general, PKC activity is inhibitory for ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and more specifically, receptor-mediated PKC activity limits the ability of the mAChR to stimulate ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of PKC on ACK-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were mediated via direct serine or threonine phosphorylation of ACK-1 on some inhibitory site(s), the potential of PMA to increase 32P incorporation into ACK-1 was assessed in 32P-labeled SH-SY5Y cells. Incubation of32P-prelabeled cells with Oxo-M induced an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 (Fig.4 A) and a corresponding increase in 32P incorporation into ACK-1 (Fig.4 B). In contrast, the addition of PMA resulted in a decrease in the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of ACK-1 (Fig. 4 A, see also Fig. 3 A, first lane versus fifth lane) with no detectable increase in32P incorporation into ACK-1 (Fig. 4 B). Under the latter conditions, incubation with PMA induced phosphorylation of the PKC substrate MARCKS in"

The time course of thapsigargin-sensitive ATP-dependent45Ca influx into and efflux out of cardiac SR vesicles from PLB-KO and wild-type (WT) mice was measured at 100 nm free [Ca]. We found that PLB decreased the initial SR Ca uptake rate (0.13versus 0.31 nmol/mg/s) and decreased steady-state45Ca content (0.9 versus 4.1 nmol/mg protein). Furthermore, at similar total SR [Ca], the pump-mediated Ca efflux rate was higher in WT (0.065 versus 0.037 nmol/mg/s). The pump-independent leak rate constant (k leak) was also measured at 100 nm free [Ca]. The results indicate thatk leak was <1% of pump-mediated backflux and was not different among nonpentameric mutant PLB (PLB-C41F), WT pentameric PLB (same expression level), and PLB-KO. Therefore differences in passive SR Ca leak cannot be the cause of the higher thapsigargin-sensitive Ca efflux from the WT membranes. We conclude that the decreased total SR [Ca] in WT mice is caused by decreased SR Ca influx rate, an increased Ca-pump backflux, and unaltered leak. Based upon both thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, we conclude that PLB decreases the energetic efficiency of the SR Ca pump.

The pump establishes this gradient at steady-state through a balance of the following 3 fluxes: an SR Ca pump-dependent influx balanced by a pump-dependent efflux (or “backflux”) and a passive leak flux (mediated by the ryanodine receptor or other pathways). Backflux is a unidirectional flux that results from reversal of the SR Ca pump in the forward mode. High Ca within the SR is transported through the pump back into the cytosol, and ATP can be made from ADP and inorganic phosphate as has been demonstrated directly in SR membrane vesicles (1Feher J.J.

FEBS Lett. 1971; 12: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Backflux has also been described in both digitonin-permeabilized isolated cardiac myocytes (5Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 853: 350-352Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and in isolated myocytes under whole-cell voltage clamp (6Shannon T.R. Ginsburg K.S. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 322-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Phospholamban (PLB) is an important regulator of the SR Ca pump. In the unphosphorylated state it associates with the SR Ca pump to inhibit its activity. This inhibition can be relieved through phosphorylation by protein kinase A and/or Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (7Kranias E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Tada M. Inui M. Yamada M. Kadoma M.A. Kuzuya T. Abe H. Kakiuchi S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although it is well established that PLB inhibits the forward mode of SR Ca transport by increasing the forwardK Ca(K Ca-f) to higher [Ca], the effects of PLB on reverse SR Ca-ATPase andK Ca(K Ca-r) are unknown. This becomes an important issue, especially in the case where the Ca pump approaches thermodynamic equilibrium, as may be the case in intact myocytes under some conditions (9Ginsburg K.S. Weber C.R. Bers D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). That is, the forward and reverse Ca flux can reach the point where they are equal and opposite, and the [Ca] gradient is maximal at about 7000:1 (10Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). If PLB shiftsK Ca-f without shiftingK Ca-r by a comparable amount, the maximal [Ca] gradient that the SR Ca pump can generate may change, and this could alter the energetic efficiency of the pump. PLB coexists in the cardiac myocyte in both a monomeric and pentameric form. The pentameric form has been reported to form a channel that may mediate Ca leak from the SR (11Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kovacs R.J. Nelson M.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18364-18368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we measure forward and reverse Ca pump flux and also pump-independent leak in SR vesicles from wild-type (WT) mice, phospholamban knockout mice (PLB-KO), and mice that express equal amounts of either wild-type PLB (PLB-70) or nonpentamer-forming mutant PLB (PLB-C41F) upon a knockout background. Nonpump-mediated Ca leak was not different among these groups, which does not support any significant role for a PLB-mediated leak under our conditions. We hypothesize that PLB inhibits SR Ca pump influx at the same time that it stimulates SR Ca pump backflux. Such an effect would result in a decreased ΔG SRCa and decreased SR Ca pump energetic efficiency. The data in WT, PLB-KO, and PLB-70 membranes all support this hypothesis. All chemicals were from Sigma, except as indicated. Mathematical data manipulation was performed using Lotus 1–2-3 (Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, MA) and Excel (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, WA). Nonlinear regression fits and statistics were done with GraphPad (iSi Software, Philadelphia, PA). For the purposes of this paper the efficiency of the SR Ca pump is defined as follows: Eftpump=ΔGSRCa·100ΔGATPEquation 1 where ΔG ATP is the free energy stored in the form of ATP in the cytosol or 59 kJ/mol (13Allen D.G. Morris P.G. Orchard C.H. Pirolo J.S. J. Physiol. 1985; 361: 185-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and ΔG SRCa is the free energy required by the pump to establish the SR [Ca] gradient. This is defined as follows: ΔGSRCa=2RT·ln[Ca]SR[Ca]cEquation 2 where [Ca]SR is free SR Ca and [Ca]SR/[Ca]cis the free SR Ca gradient. Therefore when the pump generates a higher SR [Ca] gradient, it is operating at a higher energetic efficiency. In this paper we measure [Ca]SRT(and relate it to [Ca]SR) in SR membrane vesicles at 100 nm[Ca]c as a measure of the SR [Ca] gradient. PLB-KO, PLB-70, and WT mice were anesthetized with 0.25 mg of pentobarbital/g of body weight. Thoracotomy was performed, and hearts were removed, cannulated via the aorta, and perfused with 5 ml of 10 mm caffeine, 10 mm EGTA, normal tyrode. Normal tyrode consisted of (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 10 glucose, 5 HEPES, and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Hearts were then perfused with 15 ml of 0.5 mm BAPTA in (in mm) 140 sucrose, 70 KCl, 40 HEPES, pH 7.2 (membrane buffer). Subsequently, the ventricular tissue was separated from the rest of the heart and put into 0.5 BAPTA membrane buffer, minced, and homogenized with two 15-s pulses of a polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY). This procedure depletes the membranes of endogenous Ca. The membranes that resulted were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, resuspended in 1 ml 0.5 BAPTA, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 ryanodine, and 20 μmdigitonin in membrane buffer, and glass-Teflon homogenized. The membranes were split into two portions. One was treated with 25 nmol/mg thapsigargin (Thg) and the other with Me2SO vehicle. The membranes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow ryanodine and thapsigargin binding and were then put on ice. Triplicate incubates were set up for plus and minus Thg groups. Each incubate contained 86 μl of uptake buffer. MgATP (4 μl, 100 mm stock) and 10 μl of membranes (∼5 mg/ml) were beaded on the side of the test tube, and the assay for each time point was begun by vortexing, thus washing the ATP and the membranes into the incubate. The incubates contained (final concentration in mm during incubation) 0.69 MgCl2, 0.5 BAPTA, 0.151 CaCl2 (100 nm[Ca]c, 100–200 μCi of45Ca), 4 MgATP, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 14 sucrose, 127 KCl, 40 HEPES, pH 7.2. Phosphocreatine (12.5) and 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase were present to regenerate ATP. Mitochondrial Ca uptake was inhibited by 2 μm ruthenium red and 4 μm oligomycin. Digitonin (20 μm) inhibited sarcolemmal Ca uptake, and ryanodine receptors were blocked by 0.5 mm ryanodine. Uptake was stopped with an ice-cold solution (in mm) of 1 EGTA, 200 KCl, 20 Mops, Tris to pH 7.4 (stop solution). The incubates were vacuum-filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The tubes were washed 3×, and the filter was washed an additional 2× with stop solution. Membranes were allowed to take up Ca for 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 s, thus forming the uptake part of the curve (see Fig. 2). The backflux part of the curve was constructed from incubates that were allowed to take up Ca for 90 s, at which point an efflux buffer was added. Efflux buffer consisted of (final concentration in mmduring incubation) 50 EGTA, 17.1 CaCl2 (100 nm[Ca]c), 40 HEPES, pH 7.2. This solution caused 45Ca efflux while holding [Ca]c at 100 nm and reducing extracellular 45Ca specific activity 100-fold. The indicated time points were taken after the addition of efflux buffer. Membrane protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad total protein assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The influx part of the experiment was fit with a rising exponential function, [Ca]SRT=[Ca](SRT−SS)(1−exp(−kinf·t))Equation 3 where k inf is the rate constant and t is time. Steady-state [Ca]SRT([Ca]SRT-SS) was therefore the plateau of the relationship. Note that the described data are “efflux-sensitive” uptake. We found that a varying percentage of the total Ca taken up did not come out of the membranes upon addition of efflux buffer. We therefore characterized the kinetics of the SR Ca pump only in terms of Ca available for transport into and out of the membranes. The initial rate of uptake was determined as the derivative of this function at t = 0. JSR=d[Ca]SRTdt=kinf·[Ca](SRT−SS)·exp(−kinf·t)Equation 4 Similarly, the efflux part of the time course was described with an exponential decay, [Ca]SRT=[Ca](SRT+efl)·exp(−kefl·t)+[Ca](SRT−efl)Equation 5 where [Ca]SRT+efl is efflux buffer-sensitive [Ca]SRT, and [Ca]SRT-efl is efflux buffer-insensitive [Ca]SRT(i.e. see Fig. 2, bottom plateau of the curve).k inf is the rate constant, andt is the time from dilution. The rate of efflux at identical [Ca]SRT+efl (0.8 nmol/mg) in all groups was determined from the following derivative: JSR=−kefl·[Ca](SRT+efl)·exp(−kefl·t)Equation 6 where t is the time from dilution to [Ca]SRT-efl = 0.8 nmol/mg. The initial rate of 45Ca uptake when [Ca]SR = 0 is described by the classic Hill equation, Jpumpf=Vmax1+KCa­f[Ca]cnEquation 7 where J pumpf is the forward pump rate and V max,K Ca-f, and n are the maximal velocity, [Ca]c at half-maximal velocity, and the Hill coefficient in the forward direction, respectively. We set n to 2,K Ca-f to 0.25, and 0.14 for WT and PLB-KO, respectively (as measured by Frank, et al. (14Frank K. Tilgmann C. Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14176-14182Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Given these parameters and J pumpf,V max was determined. The rate of backflux at steady-state was also determined by using Equation 6, where t = 0 (i.e. the rate when excess 40Ca is added; see Fig. 2). This rate is described by the following: Jpumpr=Vmax[Ca]SRK(Ca­r)n1+[Ca]cKCa­fn+[Ca]SRKCa­rnEquation 8 where J pumpr is the unidirectional reverse pump rate andK Ca-r has its usual meaning for the reverse pump rate. This is a special case of the generic reversible equation, Jpump=Vmaxf[Ca]cKCa­fnf−Vmaxr[Ca]SRKCa­rnr1+[Ca]cKCa­fnf+[Ca]SRKCa­rnrEquation 9 where V maxf =V maxr and nf =nr. For 45Ca efflux, the left term in the numerator is zero, giving Equation 8. GivenJ pumpr and theV max above, theK Ca-r can be inferred from Equation8. At steady-state J pump is zero, so the numerator of Equation 9 is zero, and this reduces to the Haldane relationship. [Ca]SR[Ca]c=Keq=KCa­rKCa­fEquation 10 Combining with Equation 2, we arrive at Equation 11. ΔGSRCa=2RT·lnKCa­rKCa­fEquation 11 Thus, if we know K Ca-f and derive K Ca-r from Equation 8 the ΔG SRCa can be inferred. Membranes from PLB-KO, PLB-70, and PLB-C41F mice were prepared as above except 30 μm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 140 KCl, 40 HEPES, pH 7.4 was used for perfusion, homogenization, and resuspension instead of BAPTA. The protocol for measuring passive SR Ca leak from the membranes is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. Mouse membranes were added to a cuvette with stirring at a final concentration of ∼1–2 mg/ml. Also present were (final concentrations) EGTA (30 μm), MgCl2 (1 mm free), the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin (10 μg/ml), oligomycin (2 μm) and ruthenium red (2 μm) to inhibit mitochondrial uptake, and 0.5 mm ryanodine to block ryanodine receptors. [Ca]c was measured with 2 μm indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). An 8100 series spectrofluorometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) was used to excite the indo-1 at 355 nm. Fluorescence emission at 400 and 470 nm was measured. The 400:470 ratio was converted to [Ca]c using the Grynkiewicz equation (9Ginsburg K.S. Weber C.R. Bers D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Uptake was started by 4 mm ATP addition. ATP was regenerated with 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 12.5 mm phosphocreatine. EGTA or Ca was added such that a plateau was reached at ∼100 nm[Ca]c. [Ca]c gradually rose after 10 nmol/mg Thg was added until the SR Ca pump was completely blocked. Passive leak continued until the SR was empty of Ca. The leak rate constant (see below) was used to characterize the leak in the different groups of membranes. [Ca]c was converted to total Ca ([Ca]T) using known Ca binding constants for all buffers within the cuvette (see Table I). These binding constants were collected from the literature, and nearly all of the endogenous affinity constants come from in vitromeasurements where physiological intracellular conditions were simulated (normal ionic strength and pH value), usually at room temperature.Table ICuvette Ca Buffering ParametersBufferB maxK dRef.μmSR Ca pump0.1576 μm0.639Feher J.J.

Open table in a new tab Although all are accounted for, note that EGTA and indo-1 account for the majority of the buffering capacity. Exogenous EGTA and indo-1 are overwhelmingly the dominant Ca buffering species accounting for >98% of the Ca bound (≥32 μm versus ∼0.3 μm). Fortunately these are the buffers that we know the most about and of which we can be most sure. Constants for EGTA in particular were fully corrected for ionic strength and pH value using the Maxchelator program (see Ref. 16Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitilli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar; free for download on the World Wide Web). Referenced values were converted from nmol/mg to μmol/liter cytosol using the conversion factors 0.4 liter of cell volume/kg of wet weight, 120 mg of homogenate protein/g of wet weight (17Hove-Madsen L. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C677-C686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a measured value of 0.312 mg of membranes/mg of homogenate. Therefore for each time point in Fig. 1 A, we know [Ca]c and [Ca]T. The difference between the [Ca]T before Thg and [Ca]T after all of the Ca has leaked out of the SR is the [Ca]SRTjust prior to Thg addition. Because we know how much Ca leaks out of the SR during the experiment, we can now calculate [Ca]SRT at each time point as the amount of Ca that hasn't leaked out yet. Given [Ca]SRT and the SR Ca buffering parameters, [Ca]SR can be calculated. SR volume was assumed to be 3% of cellular volume (18Page E. Mccallister L.P. Power B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1971; 68: 1465-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,19Page E. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: C147-C158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca]SRT was converted to [Ca]SR using the following relationships. [Ca]SRT=[Ca·L]SR+[Ca]SREquation 12 [Ca·L]SR=Bmax−SR·[Ca]SRKd−SR+[Ca]SREquation 13 B max-SR andK d-SR have been previously determined to be 14 mmol/liter of SR and 638 μm, respectively (10Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Equation 13 was substituted into Equation 12, and [Ca]SR as a function of [Ca]SRT was calculated from the quadratic solution of the result. The leak rate (J leak) is the change in [Ca]T over time and is assumed to be proportional to the concentration difference ([Ca]SR − [Ca]c), Jleak=kleak([Ca]SR−[Ca]c)Equation 14 where k leak is a rate constant of leak flux, determined by linear regression of leak flux data (see Fig. 1 B; gray line). There are two primary routes of Ca efflux from the SR when the ryanodine receptors are blocked with high ryanodine (as is the case with all of the experiments here). These are backflux (1Feher J.J. Briggs F.N. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 2Takenaka H. Adler P.N. Katz A.M. J. Biol.

To measure E pump with and without PLB we must first determine the extent to which passive leak rate contributes to SR Ca efflux in our system. Fig. 1 A shows the protocol that we used to measure this leak rate. When [Ca]c was ∼100 nm, Thg (25 nmol/mg) was added. Thg forms a dead-end complex with the SR Ca pump (20Sagara Y. Wade J.B. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1286-1292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) thus inhibiting both SR Ca influx and backflux through the pump. [Ca]c gradually rose until the SR Ca pump was completely blocked. Passive leak continued until the SR was empty of Ca. [Ca]T was computed at each time point using known Ca binding constants (Table I). [Ca]SRT was computed as [Ca]T at the end of the leak minus [Ca]T before Thg, and both [Ca]SRT andd[Ca]SRT/dtcould be calculated for each time point. [Ca]SR was calculated using Equations 12 and 13 (10). The slope of the relationship between the leak flux (J leak) and the free Ca difference across the SR membrane isk leak (Fig. 1 B). The following three groups of mice were compared: 1) transgenic mice that expressed only mutant nonpentamer-forming PLB (Ref. 21Chu G. Li L. Sato Y. Harrer J.M. Kadambi V.J. Hoit B.D. Bers D.M. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33674-33680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; PLB-C41F), 2) PLB-KO, and 3) PLB-70 (mice that express WT PLB at the same level as the mutant PLB is expressed in PLB-C41F). There was no significant difference in SR Ca leak between the PLB-C41F group, the PLB-70 group, and the PLB-KO group (0.058 ± 0.011 versus 0.061 ± 0.010 versus 0.045 ± 0.006/min, Student'st test, p > 0.05, n = 6). We conclude that passive SR Ca leak is unchanged in mice containing mutant or wild-type PLB or in PLB-KO. Furthermore, there was no evidence of SR Ca leak through a pentameric PLB channel under these conditions. Fig.2 A shows the protocol for measuring unidirectional SR Ca fluxes along with a typical experiment.45Ca uptake is started with the addition of ATP and ventricular membranes to the uptake medium as described under “Materials and Methods.” Incubates were filtered at the indicated times to measure [Ca]SRT. At 90 s excess nonradioactive 40Ca buffered with 50 mm EGTA was added. The high Ca/EGTA concentration diluted the 45Ca to negligible levels while maintaining a [Ca]c of 100 nm. Under this condition, unidirectional SR 45Ca efflux took place. Note that the actual [Ca]SRT and the fluxes at steady-state have not changed here. The backflux has only been “uncovered” by the dilution of 45Ca outside the vesicles. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, where Ca flux rates were calculated from SR Ca content data as in Fig. 2 A. In this case mean kinetic parameters were taken from the mean PLB-KO data (see below). Fig. 2 A (dashed line) shows that although the [45Ca] has changed, [Ca]c and [Ca]SRT (and [Ca]SR) have not. The45Ca efflux gives a measure of the unidirectional backflux at steady-state, but the net total Ca flux is still zero. Also note the rapid loss of 45Ca compared with the leak in Fig.1 A (translated into the gray dashed line in Fig.2 A). Therefore nearly all of this 45Ca efflux is backflux through the SR Ca pump (Fig. 2 A). As can be seen in Fig. 3 A,45Ca began to accumulate in the SR immediately upon ATP and membrane addition in both WT and PLB-KO. [Ca]SRT came nearly to steady-state where Ca influx and efflux are equal by 90 s. [Ca]SRT-SS as determined by Equation 3 in WT was ∼25% of that in PLB-KO (0.9 versus4.1 nmol/mg of protein). This important result may reflect a lower SR [Ca] gradient and therefore a lower ΔG SRCa (Equation 2) at steady-state. Note that in some experiments, we found a varying percentage of the total Ca taken up did not come out of the membranes upon addition of efflux buffer (the nonzero plateau in Fig. 3 B). This Ca appears to be pump-insensitive. Characterization of the kinetics of the SR Ca pump is therefore only in terms of Ca that was available for both uptake and efflux from the membranes. [Ca]SRT-SS is therefore the plateau in Fig. 3 A minus the efflux-insensitive Ca (i.e.the plateau in Fig. 3 B). Note that this treatment is conservative in that it tends to minimize differences between WT and PLB-KO. From the higher [Ca]SRT in PLB-KO we conclude that the efficiency of SR Ca uptake is lower in the presence of PLB (Equation 1). The only alternatives would be (1Feher J.J. Briggs F.N. Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 1135-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) a difference in leak flux (not the case, see above) or (2Takenaka H. Adler P.N. Katz A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12649-12656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) different intra-SR Ca buffering. The latter is highly unlikely, because the calsequestrin concentration is the same in PLB-KO and WT mice (22Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), and the concentration would have to be five times higher to explain the results. These results are also consistent with findings of much higher SR Ca load in PLB-KO intact myocytes (23Li L. Chu G. Kranias E.G. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1335-H1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having examined the raw data, we can now further characterize these experiments in a quantitative manner. Two different methods can be used to determine the SR Ca pump efficiency from the data. First previously determined SR Ca buffering characteristics (10Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were used to convert vesicular [Ca]SRT to [Ca]SR (using Equations 12 and 13; see also Table II). Note that these values are similar to the 7000:1 [Ca]SR:[Ca]cratio (∼700 μm[Ca]SR) expected from the results of Shannon and Bers (10Shannon T.R. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1524-1531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). From this ratio, the SR Ca pump efficiency was determined using Equations 1 and 2. We found a basal ΔG SRCa in WT mice of 33.5 kJ/mol (56.8% efficiency). PLB-KO had a much higher ΔG SRCa (43.9 kJ/mol; 74.5%).

Interestingly, the N-terminal fragment derived from pIL1α proteolytic processing contains a functional nuclear localization signal (7Wessendorf J. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol.

The ability of pIL1α to bind the IL1 type I receptors with high affinity, with subsequent activation of the signal transduction pathway, and the presence of the nuclear localization sequence anticipates the existence of a biological role for pIL1α, independent from the activity of mIL1α. Indeed, comparative studies using the pIL1α and mIL1α forms have suggested that pIL1α, but not mIL1α, is a negative regulator of cell migration (9McMahon G. Garfinkel S. Prudovsky I. Hu X. Maciag T.

Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because (i) the release pathways utilized by the FGF prototypes have diverged, and (ii) it is unlikely that the pathway responsible for the regulation of FGF1 would have evolved independent of the mechanisms utilized by other signal peptide-deficient gene products to gain access to the extracellular compartment, we sought to determine whether other signal peptide-deficient cytokines are also able to utilize the FGF1 release pathway for export. We focused our effort on IL1α because its precursor form is biologically functional (5Mosley B. Urdal D. Prickett K. Larsen A. Cosman D. Conlon P. Gillis S. Dower S. J. Biol.

We report that the release pathway utilized by IL1α exhibits similar biochemical, pharmacological, and biological properties to the FGF1 release pathway. In contrast, unlike the FGF1 release pathway (16Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C. Garfinkel S. Burgess W. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Lastly, the stress-induced IL1α and FGF1 release pathways may be convergent, because the expression of pIL1α acts as a dominant-negative repressor of FGF1 release. Human pIL1α-(1−271) and mIL1α-(113–271) cDNAs (7Wessendorf J. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as pIL1α·β-gal and mIL1α·β-gal fusion constructs, were inserted into the expression vector, pMEXneo (25Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were obtained as previously described (7Wessendorf J. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Brown S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfectants were grown on cell culture dishes coated with 10-μg/cm2 fibronectin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgro) supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (BCS, HyClone), 1× antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 400 μg/ml geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). The Syt1 constructs, full-length rat p65 Syt1 and its deletion mutant Syt1Δ(120–214) in the expression vector pMEXneo/hygro, were obtained as described (17LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The Syt1 constructs were cotransfected into mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants using 5 μg of DNA mixed with the multicomponent lipid-based transfection reagent FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cotransfectants were grown on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/cm2) cell culture dishes in DMEM, supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 1× antibiotic/antimycotic, 400 μg/ml G418, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The human FGF1 construct in the expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) was obtained by digesting the pXZ38 plasmid (12Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with Eco RV and Hpa I (New England BioLabs Inc.), isolating the 836-base pair fragment containing FGF1 by electroelution, ligating into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro expression vector previously digested with Eco RV, and purifying by electroelution. The FGF1 pcDNA3.1/Hygro construct was cotransfected into mIL1α·β-gal and pIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants using 5 μg of DNA mixed with the multicomponent lipid-based transfection reagent, FuGENE6, following the manufacturer's instructions. Stable cotranfectants were selected and grown as described above. Whereas multiple clones were obtained in the mIL1α, FGF1, and mIL1α·FGF1 backgrounds, we were limited to studying a single clone in the pIL1α and pIL1α·FGF1 backgrounds. Transfectants were grown to 70–80% confluency and prior to the temperature stress, the cells were washed with DMEM. The heat shock was performed in DMEM at 42 °C for 2 h, as previously described (12Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). When FGF1 transfectants were subjected to temperature stress, the heat shock medium was supplemented with 4 units/ml heparin (Upjohn Co.). The effects of Brefeldin A (Epicenter Technologies), 2-deoxyglucose (Sigma), and amlexanox (Takeda) on mIL1α release were evaluated as previously described (17LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S.

Prior to and after temperature stress, total cell lysates were obtained by sonication of cell pellets collected in Germino buffer DT (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) as described previously (26Germino J. Gray J. Charbonneau H. Vanaman T. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and then treated with either dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma) and (NH4)2SO4 (Sigma) or were left untreated. DTT treatment was performed at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) DTT at 37 °C for 2 h, and (NH4)2SO4 fractionation was performed at 95% (w/v) saturation as described previously (18Carreira C. LaVallee T.

Cell lysates and DTT- or (NH4)2SO4-treated medium from mIl1α·β-gal and pIL1α·βgal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were further processed by affinity chromatography using a 0.5-mlp- aminobenzyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside column (Sigma) previously equilibrated with Germino buffer DT. The column was washed with Germino buffer DT, followed by a wash with Germino buffer DT. The proteins were eluted with 2 ml of 0.1m sodium borate, pH 10 and were concentrated by centrifugation using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Prior to immunoprecipitation, the cells were washed and scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation as described previously (26Germino J. Gray J. Charbonneau H. Vanaman T. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cold NP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 300 mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Conditioned medium with or without DTT treatment were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Ultrafree-15, Millipore) to a volume of ∼500 μl. 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μl of goat anti-human IL1α polyclonal antibodies (1.21 mg/ml, a generous gift from Dr. R. Chizzonite, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.) were added to either cell lysates or conditioned medium, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 18 h. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. All IL1α samples either eluted from the p- aminobenzyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside column or purified by immunoprecipitation were resolved by either 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (native forms of pIL1α and mIL1α) or 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (pIL1α·β-gal and IL1α·β-gal fusion proteins) and subjected to immunoblot analysis as previously described (9McMahon G. Garfinkel S. Prudovsky I. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28202-28205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and probed with goat anti-human IL-1α polyclonal antibody at a 1:1200 dilution. IL-1α specific bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of the pIL1α·β-gal/FGF1 and mIL1α·β-gal/FGF1 NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants was accomplished by dividing individual cell lysates and conditioned medium in half for the detection of FGF1 and IL1α immunoreactive bands. For FGF1 analysis, total cell lysates were obtained by sonication in cold lysis buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) and adsorbed to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris pH 7.4 containing 10 mm EDTA (TEB). The column was washed with TEB, and the proteins were eluted with 2 ml of TEB containing 1.5 mNaCl. The volume of the eluates was reduced using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon), and the eluates were analyzed by 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-human FGF1 polyclonal antibodies (27Sano H. Forough R. Maier J. Case J. Jackson A. Engleka K. Maciag T. Wilder R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as described previously (16Tarantini F.

IL1α was analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti-IL1α antibody and resolved by 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis, as described above. Cell lysates from mIL1α·β-gal, mIL1α·β-gal/p65 Syt1, and mIL1α·β-gal/Syt1Δ(120–214) mutant NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants were obtained by sonication in NP lysis buffer and processed as described below. Conditioned medium from these cotransfectants were treated with 0.1% (w/v) DTT and divided into two equal samples. The first sample was adsorbed to heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (1 ml) and washed with TEB, and samples were eluted with 1.5m NaCl, as reported above. Cell lysates and conditioned medium purified by heparin affinity were resolved by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-rat Syt1 polyclonal antibody as described previously (17LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The second sample was processed by IL1α immunoprecipitation as described above. As a negative control, cell lysates were also immunoprecipitated with a control antibody (goat IgG purified immunoglobulin from pooled normal goat serum, Sigma). Cell lysates and conditioned medium purified by IL1α immunoprecipitation were resolved by 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, followed by IL1α immunoblot analysis, as described above. IL1α and Syt1 specific bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) following the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of lactate dehydrogenase in conditioned medium was utilized as an assessment of cell lysis in all experiments and was measured by a colorimetric assay using pyruvate as a substrate (Sigma). Each experiment reported was repeated at least three times with similar results in all cases, and representative data are shown in each figure. We evaluated the ability of human IL1α to enter the extracellular compartment using NIH 3T3 cells because these cells (i) are refractory to the activity of endogenous and exogenous IL1α (data not shown) and (ii) have proven to be valuable for the study of the FGF1 release pathway (16Tarantini F.

Thus, stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants expressing either pIL1α or mIL1α with or without the β-gal reporter gene were obtained and were subjected to temperature stress at 42 °C for 2 h. Cell lysates and conditioned medium treated with 0.1% (w/v) DTT were processed for IL1α immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, mIL1α and mIL1α·β-gal were readily visible in medium conditioned by heat shock. In contrast, neither pIL1α nor pIL1α·β-gal was detected in heat shock-conditioned medium, but both forms of the polypeptide were present in cell lysates (Fig. 1, A andB). These data suggest the following: (i) the mature (residues 113 to 271) but not the precursor (residues 1 to 271) form of IL1α was able to enter the extracellular compartment in response to temperature stress, (ii) the release of IL1α does not restrict export of the reporter gene product, β-gal, and (iii) cell lysis does not account for the release of mIL1α because the absence of pIL1α in medium conditioned by heat shock served as a negative control. Because FGF1 (14Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but not FGF2 (19Shi J. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1142-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was released from NIH 3T3 cells in response to heat shock as a DTT-sensitive latent homodimer (14Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and both reducing agents and (NH4)2SO4were able to activate the heparin affinity of latent FGF1(16), we questioned whether these reagents would also affect the ability of IL1α to be recognized by affinity reagents. Because mIL1α·β-gal does not exhibit heparin-binding affinity (data not shown), we utilized β-gal affinity and IL1α immunoprecipitation to assess this issue. As shown in Fig. 1 C, IL1α immunoblot analysis of medium conditioned by temperature stress was performed usingp- aminobenzyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (PATG) affinity and failed to detect the presence of the IL1α·β-gal fusion product. However, treatment of heat shocked-conditioned medium with either 0.1% (w/v) DTT or 95% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 did resolve the presence of mIL1α·β-gal in medium conditioned by heat shock from mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. In contrast, the use of IL1α immunoprecipitation detected the presence of IL1α·β-gal in medium conditioned by heat shock, and the addition of either DTT (Fig.1 D) or (NH4)2SO4 (data not shown) to the medium did not alter the ability of the anti-IL1α antibody to recognize the fusion protein (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that whereas mIL1α·β-gal is present in the extracellular compartment in a conformation that does not efficiently recognize PATG (unlike FGF1 that utilizes Cys oxidation for export, Ref. 15Tarantini F. Gamble S. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29039-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this conformation may not represent mIL1α but rather the conformation of β-gal. Thus, it is unlikely that mIL1α utilizes Cys oxidation for export. We also examined the kinetics and pharmacologic properties of mIL1α·β-gal release in response to temperature stress, because the FGF1 release pathway exhibits relatively slow export kinetics (14Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, FGF1 is sensitive to agents that interfere with translation (12Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10691-10695Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), transcription (12Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X. Engleka K. Forough R. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 35: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and assembly of the F-actin cytoskeleton (28Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but is not sensitive to Brefeldin A, an agent that interferes with the function of the ER-Golgi apparatus (14Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As previously observed with FGF1 release (14Jackson A. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Friedman S. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 33-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the release of mIL1α·β-gal also required at least 90 min of temperature stress before IL1α immunoblot analysis was able to resolve the presence of the fusion protein in medium conditioned by heat shock (Fig.2 A). In addition, IL1α immunoblot analysis revealed that the release of mIL1α·β-gal was not sensitive to treatment of the mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants with Brefeldin A (Fig. 2 B) but was sensitive to the presence of 2-deoxyglucose (Fig. 2 C) as well as cycloheximide and actinomycin D (data not shown). Further, the release of mIL1α·β-gal was also sensitive to treatment with amlexanox (Fig. 2 D), an agent which induces the Src-dependent disassembly of F-actin stress fibers (28Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and exhibits a dose-response to amlexanox similar to that reported for the inhibition of FGF1 release in vitro (18Carreira C. LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J. Hampton B. Burgess W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22224-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the pathway utilized by mIL1α·β-gal for entering the extracellular compartment is dependent upon transcription, translation, ATP biosynthesis, and the actin cytoskeleton but is independent of the function of the ER-Golgi apparatus. Because the kinetic and pharmacologic properties of mIL1α·β-gal release were remarkably similar to that previously reported for FGF1, we examined the potential role of p65 Syt1 in the IL1α release pathway. Syt1 is the prototype member of a gene family of vesicular transmembrane Ca2+- and acidic phospholipid-binding proteins (29Perin M. Fried V. Mignery G. Jahn R. Sudhof T. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) involved in the regulation of conventional exocytosis (30Perin M. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endocytosis (31Zhang J. Davletov B. Sudhof T. Anderson R. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because the extravesicular p40 domain of Syt1 is released as an aggregate with FGF1 in response to heat shock (16Tarantini F. LaVallee T. Jackson A. Gamble S. Carreira C. Garfinkel S. Burgess W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22209-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is associated with FGF1 in vivo (18Carreira C. LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J. Hampton B. Burgess W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22224-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we utilized a p65 Syt1 mutant (p65 Syt1Δ(120–214)) lacking the C2A domain, which acts as a dominant negative effector of FGF1 release in response to heat shock (17LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of p65 Syt1 in the release of mIL1α·β-gal, we obtained stable NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants expressing either p65 Syt1/mIL1α·β-gal or p65 Syt1Δ(120–214)/mIL1α·β-gal and examined medium conditioned by heat shock for the presence of p40 Syt1 and IL1α·β-gal using immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig.3 A, Syt1 immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of p40 Syt1 in medium conditioned by heat shock from the p65 Syt1/mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants but did not report the presence of p40 Syt1 in heat shocked-conditioned medium from either mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell transfectants or p65 Syt1Δ(120–214)/mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants. In contrast, however, IL1α immunoblot analysis did reveal the presence of mIL1α·β-gal in medium conditioned by temperature stress independent of the expression of either p65 Syt1 or p65 Syt1Δ(120–214) (Fig. 3 B). These data suggest that unlike the stress-induced FGF1 release pathway (17LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Gamble S. Carreira C. Jackson A. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22217-22223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the IL1α release pathway may not utilize the function of p65 Syt1. However, it is not possible to eliminate the function of another member of the Syt gene family in the regulation of mIL1α release. Although the data with p65 Syt1Δ(120–214) expression suggest that the IL1α and FGF1 release pathways may have diverged, we questioned whether the coexpression of IL1α and FGF1 in the NIH 3T3 cell could confirm this premise. Thus we obtained stable NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants in which pIL1α·β-gal and mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 transfectants were cotransfected with FGF1 and examined their ability to release mIL1α·β-gal, pIL1α·β-gal, and FGF1 in response to heat shock. As shown in Fig.4, IL1α and FGF1 immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of both mIL1α·β-gal and FGF1 in medium conditioned by heat shock from the FGF1/mIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants. However, IL1α and FGF1 immunoblot analysis failed to detect the presence of either pIL1α or FGF1 from the FGF1/pIL1α·β-gal NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants in response to temperature stress (Fig. 4). Because the precursor form but not the mature form of IL1α was able to repress the release of FGF1 in response to heat shock, the precursor domain of IL1α may contain a structural feature that may function as a dominant-negative effector of FGF1 release. Although we do not know the element within the precursor domain of IL1α responsible for this event, these data do suggest that the IL1α and FGF1 release pathways may indeed be convergent. It is well established that the precursor forms of the IL1 prototypes are cell-associated polypeptides whereas the mature forms of the IL1 prototypes are present in either biological fluids or cell culture medium (32Dinarello C. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dinarello C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 98485-98489Google Scholar, 34Suttles J. Giri J. Mizel S. J.

A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar); an observation which suggests that the mature forms of the IL1 prototypes may be preferred for release. Indeed, in transgenic mice manipulated to overexpress mIL1α in basal keratinocytes, high levels of mIL1α were released into the circulation (36Groves R. Mizutani H. Kieffer J. Kupper T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11874-11878Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, mechanical deformation of human keratinocytes was required to induce a rapid release of pIL1α (37Lee R. Briggs W. Cheng G. Rossiter H. Libby P. Kupper T. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5084-5088PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas both precursor and mature forms of the IL1 prototypes have also been detected in cell culture medium conditioned by mononuclear cells treated with lipopolysaccharides (34Suttles J. Giri J. Mizel S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar, 38Carinci V. Guida S. Fontana M. Palla E. Rossini M. Melli M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the appearance of the precursor forms correlated with the release of LDH, a cytosolic protein used to monitor the release of cytosol because of compromised plasma membrane integrity (39Hogquist K. Unanue E. Chaplin D. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2181-2186PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that our experimental conditions also employed LDH release, and we did not observe any significant levels of extracellular LDH in response to temperature stress. However, because the pIL1α·β-gal release studies were limited to a single clone, we cannot eliminate the possibility that a critical ratio of pIL1α·β-gal expression may enable pIL1α·β-gal to be released in response to heat shock. Our data are consistent with the observation that human bladder carcinoma cells selectively release mIL1α but not pIL1α in vitro (40Watanabe N. Kobayashi Y. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, Siders, et al. (41Siders W. Klimovitz J. Mizel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22170-22174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a variety of different cell types transfected with either the precursor or mature forms of the IL1 prototypes observed that the mature forms of IL1α and IL1β were also preferred for release and that the release of mIL1α from pIL1α was dependent upon the presence of a calpain-like protease activity (41Siders W. Klimovitz J. Mizel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22170-22174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas macrophages from the ICE-null mouse were able to release pIL1β but not mIL1β in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation, these cells were also deficient in IL1α release suggesting a possible role for ICE in the release of IL1α (42Kuida K. Lippke J. Ku G. Harding M. Livingston D. Su M. Flavell R. Science. 1995; 267: 2000-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Because we were unable to observe the presence of mIL1α in cytosol derived from the pIL1α NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, even under conditions of apoptosis where ICE is functional (data not shown), it is unlikely that ICE expression is involved in the formation of mIL1α in the NIH 3T3 cell. Rather, the NIH 3T3 cells may be deficient in the expression of the appropriate calpain and as a result are not capable of processing intracellular pIL1α. Alternatively, this may also be because of the presence of a calpain inhibitor (43Croall D. DeMartino G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) or because of the absence of calpain activation in response to heat shock. However, our data do suggest that the proteolytic conversion of pIL1α to mIL1α may be prerequisite for the appearance of IL1α in the extracellular compartment. Although the ability of pIL1α to repress the release of FGF1 in response to heat shock suggests a connection between the IL1α and FGF1 release pathways, we do not know whether mIL1α requires the function of helper genes to gain access to the extracellular compartment. However, it is interesting to note that like FGF1 (18Carreira C. LaVallee T. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J. Hampton B. Burgess W. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 35: 22224-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar,44Maciag T. Hoover G. Weinstein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5333-5336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), early studies with IL1α using gel exclusion chromatography also noted the presence of IL1α in high molecular weight complexes (34Suttles J. Giri J. Mizel S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar,45Mizel S. Rosenstreich D. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 2173-2179PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these represent the IL1α equivalent of the multiprotein aggregate of FGF1(18) is not known. It is intriguing to speculate that like the FGF1 release pathway, the release of mIL1α in response to temperature stress may require the function of an unknown set of helper genes.

Deletion studies demonstrated interaction between the Cdc4p C-terminal domain and the PI 4-kinase C-terminal domain. Furthermore, interaction was abolished by the Cdc4p C-terminal domain point mutation, Gly107 to Ser. This allele also causes failure of cytokinesis. Ectopic expression of the PI 4-kinase C-terminal domain caused cytokinesis defects that were most extreme in cells carrying the G107S allele.

One hallmark of cytokinesis is the assembly of a contractile ring made of actin, myosin, and many other proteins (2Field C. Li R. Oegema K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Gould K.L. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). The contractile ring is a transient structure that in Schizosaccharomyces pombeassembles in the early stages of mitosis and disappears with cell division (4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Marks J. Hyams J.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar). The period between onset of ring assembly and its disappearance is 30–70 min, depending upon growth conditions, or about one quarter of the cell cycle (6Marks J. Hyams J.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar). The process is conserved in animal cells with a similar actin-myosin contractile ring acting in cytokinesis (2Field C. Li R. Oegema K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Rappaport R. Cytokinesis in Animal Cells. 1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996Crossref Google Scholar). Appropriate placement of the ring at the medial plane of the cell is the first critical feature of cytokinesis. It follows initiation of mitosis and requires the contribution of many gene products such as Mid1, Pos1, Pos2, and Pos3 (3Gould K.L. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, assembly of the ring occurs with recruitment of several cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins (2Field C. Li R. Oegema K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 68-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 3Gould K.L. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the contribution of these individual components in the assembly and function of the ring.One contractile ring protein essential for cytokinesis is Cdc4p. Thecdc4 locus was first identified by Nurse et al. (8Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) in a screen for cell division control mutants. Cells with disruption of the cdc4 gene or with conditionally lethal point mutations such as G19E or G107S become elongated, accumulate two or more nuclei and ill formed septa, and fail to divide (8Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 9McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic measurements reveal that these mutations cause only small conformational perturbations, suggesting that the altered phenotypes arise directly from a disruption of the function of Cdc4p rather than indirectly through a destabilization of its structure. 1Slupsky, C. M., Desautels, M., Huebert, T., Zhao, R., Hemmingsen, S. M., and McIntosh, L. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,5944–5952 1Slupsky, C. M., Desautels, M., Huebert, T., Zhao, R., Hemmingsen, S. M., and McIntosh, L. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276,5944–5952 Recent studies have shown that a function of Cdc4p is that of a myosin light chain. For example, sequence analysis suggested that Cdc4p was likely an EF-hand protein with similarity to calmodulin and to myosin essential and regulatory light chains (9McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We determined recently by NMR spectroscopy that the tertiary structure of Cdc4p is indeed that of a dumbbell-shaped EF-hand protein, composed of two structurally independent domains joined by a flexible linker region.1Its precise structure is sufficiently distinct from either the myosin essential light chain (ELC)2or regulatory light chain (RLC) of the muscle myosin-ELC-RLC complex (10Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) that it is not possible on this basis alone to identify Cdc4p as either an RLC or an ELC. However, genetic evidence suggests that Cdc4p binds to myosin heavy chain (Myo2p) at the first IQ motif, an established binding site for ELC in conventional myosins (11Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, a gene that presumably also encodes a small EF-hand protein with sequence similarity to Cdc4p was annotated as a putative RLC. This was based on sequence similarity to Drosophila melanogasterRLC (Sanger Center S. pombe sequencing group, accession number CAB54151). This protein localizes to the contractile ring yet binds to Myo2p at the second IQ motif, an established RLC-binding site. 3M. K. Balasubramanian, personal communication. 3M. K. Balasubramanian, personal communication. Thus, current genetic and biochemical evidence suggests there are two light chains associated with Myo2p: Cdc4p at the ELC position and a second protein at the RLC position.However, several observations suggest that Cdc4p may be more than just an essential light chain bound to Myo2p. First, although the abundance of Cdc4p does not vary with the cell cycle, its cellular localization does. In interphase cells, Cdc4p is detected as punctuate immunostaining distributed throughout the cells, whereas prior to cell division it is recruited to the contractile ring (9McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). How this recruitment is achieved is unknown, but it can be independent of Myo2p, because Cdc4p is still found in improperly formed rings inmyo2-null mutants (11Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cdc4p is recruited to the contractile ring in myo2-null cells via interaction with Myp2p, a second myosin heavy chain in S. pombe that also localizes to the ring (12Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Motegi F. Nakano K. Kitayama C. Yamamoto M. Mabuchi I. FEBS Let. 1997; 420: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Second, a synthetic lethal genetic interaction has been reported betweencdc4 and rng2, a gene encoding an essential contractile ring protein similar to human IQGAP1 (14Eng K. Naqvi N.I. Wong K.C.Y. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, a light chain for a type V myosin has been reported to physically associate with an IQGAP-like protein and to mediate its localization to the contractile ring (15Shannon K.B. Li R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 727-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly a human cytoskeletal ELC binds IQGAP1 (16Weissbach L. Bernards A. Herion D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that Cdc4p physically interacts with Rng2p. Human IQGAP1 is known to bind actin and calmodulin and to regulate Rho GTPases (14Eng K. Naqvi N.I. Wong K.C.Y. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it is well positioned to link signaling pathways to actin remodeling. Phenotypic analysis of cdc4 and rng2 mutants lead to the suggestion that these gene products may be involved in organizing actin cables into a ring (4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it was observed by Nurse et al. (8Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) that diploid cells bearing both mutant allelescdc4-G19E and cdc4-G107S are viable at a restrictive temperature, whereas diploid cells homozygous for either mutant allele alone are not. Such interallelic complementation can be explained if Cdc4p has more than one essential and independent function, each of which is disrupted selectively by a mutation. Alternatively, Cdc4p could serve as an oligomer with cooperative interaction of mutant proteins allowing formation of an active complex. Although there is no evidence that conventional myosin light chains function as homodimers and although purified Cdc4p is clearly a monomer in solution, a structural model with Cdc4p serving as both an ELC and RLC can be developed.1The objective of this work was to further define cdc4functions by identifying other S. pombe proteins that interact with Cdc4p. In addition to confirming the original observation of interallelic complementation of the cdc4-G107S andcdc4-G19E alleles in diploid cells, we found several additional pairs of cdc4 temperature-sensitive alleles that complement. Then, using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified interactions between Cdc4p and two proteins: one similar toSaccharomyces cerevisiae Vps27p and the other a putative phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. The latter interaction was confirmed by immunochemical methods and further investigated by deletion studies. Therefore, in addition to its role as a myosin light chain, Cdc4p may participate in interactions that regulate contractile ring assembly. Cytokinesis, the separation of one cell into two following mitosis, is a complex process requiring spatial and temporal coordination of multiple cell cycle events (1Chang F. Nurse P.

First, although the abundance of Cdc4p does not vary with the cell cycle, its cellular localization does. In interphase cells, Cdc4p is detected as punctuate immunostaining distributed throughout the cells, whereas prior to cell division it is recruited to the contractile ring (9McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). How this recruitment is achieved is unknown, but it can be independent of Myo2p, because Cdc4p is still found in improperly formed rings inmyo2-null mutants (11Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cdc4p is recruited to the contractile ring in myo2-null cells via interaction with Myp2p, a second myosin heavy chain in S. pombe that also localizes to the ring (12Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Motegi F. Nakano K. Kitayama C. Yamamoto M. Mabuchi I. FEBS Let. 1997; 420: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Second, a synthetic lethal genetic interaction has been reported betweencdc4 and rng2, a gene encoding an essential contractile ring protein similar to human IQGAP1 (14Eng K. Naqvi N.I. Wong K.C.Y. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, a light chain for a type V myosin has been reported to physically associate with an IQGAP-like protein and to mediate its localization to the contractile ring (15Shannon K.B. Li R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 727-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly a human cytoskeletal ELC binds IQGAP1 (16Weissbach L. Bernards A. Herion D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that Cdc4p physically interacts with Rng2p. Human IQGAP1 is known to bind actin and calmodulin and to regulate Rho GTPases (14Eng K. Naqvi N.I. Wong K.C.Y. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it is well positioned to link signaling pathways to actin remodeling. Phenotypic analysis of cdc4 and rng2 mutants lead to the suggestion that these gene products may be involved in organizing actin cables into a ring (4Chang F. Woollard A. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 131-142PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, it was observed by Nurse et al. (8Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) that diploid cells bearing both mutant allelescdc4-G19E and cdc4-G107S are viable at a restrictive temperature, whereas diploid cells homozygous for either mutant allele alone are not. Such interallelic complementation can be explained if Cdc4p has more than one essential and independent function, each of which is disrupted selectively by a mutation. Alternatively, Cdc4p could serve as an oligomer with cooperative interaction of mutant proteins allowing formation of an active complex. Although there is no evidence that conventional myosin light chains function as homodimers and although purified Cdc4p is clearly a monomer in solution, a structural model with Cdc4p serving as both an ELC and RLC can be developed.1 The objective of this work was to further define cdc4functions by identifying other S. pombe proteins that interact with Cdc4p. In addition to confirming the original observation of interallelic complementation of the cdc4-G107S andcdc4-G19E alleles in diploid cells, we found several additional pairs of cdc4 temperature-sensitive alleles that complement. Then, using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified interactions between Cdc4p and two proteins: one similar toSaccharomyces cerevisiae Vps27p and the other a putative phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. The latter interaction was confirmed by immunochemical methods and further investigated by deletion studies. Therefore, in addition to its role as a myosin light chain, Cdc4p may participate in interactions that regulate contractile ring assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2052378477,"We reported previously that residue 347 in activated fX (fXa) contributes to binding of the cofactor, factor Va (fVa) (Rudolph, A. E., Porche-Sorbet, R. and Miletich, J. P. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2861–2867). Four additional residues that participate in fVa binding have now been identified by mutagenesis. All five resulting fX species, fXR306A, fXE310N, fXR347N, fXK351A, and fXK414A, are activated and inhibited normally. However, the rate of inhibition by antithrombin III in the presence of submaximal concentrations of heparin is reduced for all the enzymes. In the absence of fVa, all of the enzymes bind and activate prothrombin similarly except fXaE310N, which has a reduced apparent affinity (∼3-fold) for prothrombin compared with wild type fXa (fXaWT). In the absence of phospholipid, fVa enhances the catalytic activity of fXaWT significantly, but the response of the variant enzymes was greatly diminished. On addition of 100 nm PC:PS (3:1) vesicles, fVa enhanced fXaWT, fXaR306A, and fXaE310N similarly, whereas fXaR347N, fXaK351A, and fXaK414Ademonstrated near-normal catalytic activity but reduced apparent affinity for fVa under these conditions. All enzymes function similarly to fXaWT on activated platelets, which provide saturating fVa on an ideal surface. Loss of binding affinity for fVa as a result of the substitutions in residues Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414 was verified by a competition binding assay. Thus, Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414 are likely part of a core fVa binding site, whereas Arg-306 and Glu-310 serve a less critical role. We reported previously that residue 347 in activated fX (fXa) contributes to binding of the cofactor, factor Va (fVa) (Rudolph, A. E., Porche-Sorbet, R. and Miletich, J. P.

The zymogen precursor, fX, is activated to fXa by complexes in the intrinsic (factor IXa/factor VIIIa) and extrinsic (factor VIIa/TF) coagulation pathways and by RVV-X in the presence of calcium (1Jesty J.

The light chain of fX contains 11 γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues that compose the Gla domain and two epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGF-1 and EGF-2). The activation peptide and the serine protease domain form the heavy chain of fX, which is bound to the light chain via a single disulfide bond. Factor Xa interacts synergistically with cofactor (fVa), substrate (prothrombin), and a phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex which supports maximally efficient prothrombin activation (11Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these interactions were independently evaluated for a variant recombinant fX, fXaR347N (residue 165 in chymotrypsin numbering), and it was found that substitution of Arg-347 selectively reduces fVa affinity (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The current study describes further delineation of the fVa binding site of fXa through targeted mutagenesis of additional residues in the surface epitope that includes Arg-347. Arg-306, Lys-351, and Lys-414 (125, 169, and 230 in chymotrypsin numbering, respectively) have been substituted by alanine. Glutamate 310 (129 in chymotrypsin numbering) was substituted by asparagine. The fVa affinity of the resulting enzymes was probed using functional and binding studies. It was determined that Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414 compose a core cofactor binding epitope and Glu-310 and Arg-306 form an extended region of the epitope.

All sequence changes and the entire fXWT sequence were verified by sequence analysis. Mutant and fXWT sequences were shuttled into the expression vector (ZMB3) kindly provided by Dr. Don Foster. All constructs were transfected into human kidney cells (293) using calcium phosphate precipitation (18Graham F.L. Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). 293 cells were cultured as described (13Rudolph A.E. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J.P. J. Biol.

The assay buffer used was 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000. All variant zymogens were activated as described previously for fXR347N (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, variants or fXWT (100 nm) were activated with 2 nm RVV-X for end point activation or 50 pmRVV-X for initial rate measurements. Each fX was activated by fVIIa (40 pm) in the presence of 0.5 nm lipidated tissue factor, and by fIXa (2 nm) in the presence of fVIIIa (4 units/ml) on PC:PS vesicles (20 μm). All concentrations were subsaturating for the activators and initial rates of activation (<10% of substrate utilized) were determined. Reactions were monitored over time by quenching aliquots of the reaction in EDTA buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml polyethylene glycol 8000) and measuring the rate of hydrolysis of Spectrozyme FXa™ (100 μm). Inhibition of all variants was measured using established methodologies (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Rudolph A.E. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R. Tsuda S. Miletich J.P. J. Biol.

All zymogens (100 nm) were activated by RVV-X (2 nm). Each fXa (0.5 nm) was incubated with Spectrozyme FXa™ (100 μm) in the presence of inhibitor: ATIII alone (0–4 μm), ATIII (0–50 nm) in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide (0.5 μm), ATIII (0–16 nm) in the presence of 2.5 milliunits/ml full-length heparin, or TFPI (0–50 nm). Concentrations of heparin pentasaccharide and full length heparin were empirically determined to support half-maximal acceleration of inhibition. Residual fXa activity was quantitated from Spectrozyme FXa™ hydrolysis. First and second order rate constants were derived as described (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in assay buffer as described (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kinetic values were calculated from the least squares fit of the data to Equation 1, v=Vmax[Z]/(Km+[Z])Equation 1 where v = the observed initial rate of thrombin formation, V max = the maximal initial rate of thrombin formation, [Z]= the concentration of the component being varied in the experiment, and K m= the apparent concentration of the variable component required to reach half-maximal thrombin formation under the conditions specified. Data are expressed as moles of thrombin (IIa)/s/mol of Xa. Samples were removed from each reaction at various times and quenched into EDTA buffer. Thrombin formed was quantitated by incubating quenched samples with 500 μm Spectrozyme TH™, a thrombin chromogenic substrate. The conditions for the experiments have been described in detail (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In summary, 10 nm each fXa was incubated with prothrombin alone (0–450 μm). In the absence of phospholipid, varying concentrations of fVa (0–250 nm) were incubated with 10 μm prothrombin and fXa (0.5 nm). In the presence of PC:PS vesicles (3:1, 20 μm), 20 pm fXa was incubated with fVa (0–1 nm) and the reaction was initiated with 1 μmprothrombin. Thrombin-activated platelets (108/ml) were incubated with fXa (0–1 nm), and thrombin formation was initiated by the addition of 1 μm prothrombin. Reagents for the latex bead-based binding assay were prepared as described (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, fXS379A was labeled with 125I using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radioactivity not incorporated into protein was removed using a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad). The specific activity of the labeled protein was typically 2000 cpm/ng. Labeled FXS379A was activated using RVV-X as described above. Latex beads (1.0 μm; Interfacial Dynamics Corp., Portland, OR) were coated with PC:PS (3:1) according to published methods (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Beads coated with PC only were also prepared and used in pilot experiments to demonstrate specificity; i.e. no fVa-dependent binding without PS. Nonspecific binding accounted for <10% of binding, and ∼50% of 125I-fXaS379A binding was prevented by the addition of 1 nm unlabeled fXaWT. The concentrations of all assay components were empirically determined as described (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the assay, 1 nm fVa was incubated with 0.2% (v/v) PC:PS beads and 0.8% (v/v) uncoated beads for 10 min.125I-fXaS379A (final concentration 1.0 nm) was mixed with various concentrations of either wild type or mutant fXa, added to the fVa/bead mixture, and incubated with mixing for an additional 10 min. 125I-fXaS379Awas utilized as the labeled fXa species for greater stability over time, i.e. to minimize fXa-dependent proteolysis. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets and supernatants were counted separately. Nonspecific binding was determined from reactions not containing fVa and subtracted from counts bound in the pellets. The percentage of bound fXa was quantitated relative to the amount bound in reactions with no unlabeled fXa. The apparent affinity (K d(app)) represents the concentration of unlabeled fXa required to displace 50% of125I-fXaS379A from the fVa-bound beads and is calculated from the following equation.y=100%/1+(x/Kd(app))sEquation 2 In the equation, y = % bound125I-fXaS379A, x = concentration of added, unlabeled fXa, and s = a slope factor. The model of fXa was generated from the published coordinates (21Brandstetter H. Kuhne A. Bode W. Huber R. von der Saal W. Wirthensohn K. Engh R.A. J. Biol.

In the structure, the Gla domain is missing and EGF-1 is disordered. We demonstrated previously that the employed expression system is efficacious for the production of fully functional recombinant wild-type and variant fX (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R.

Residues Arg-306, Lys-351, and Lys-414 were substituted with alanine, whereas Glu-310 and Arg-347 were substituted with asparagine, resulting in the creation of a potentialN-linked glycosylation site, NX(C/S/T), (TableI). The apparent molecular weight of fXE310N was elevated, indicating the addition of a carbohydrate group at this residue (Fig.1). However, as previously described, asparagine substitution of Arg-347 did not result in an added carbohydrate, as the electrophoretic mobility of fXR347Nwas not altered as compared with fXWT (Fig. 1; Ref.12Rudolph A.E.

Initial rates of activation by RVV-X and the extrinsic (fVIIa/TF) and intrinsic (fIXa/fVIIIa) activation complexes were quantitated by monitoring Spectrozyme FXa™ hydrolysis. Activation of all variant zymogens by all activators was very similar to the activation of fXWT. The impact of the substitutions on the active site of fXa was probed by studying the interaction between the enzymes and the physiologic inhibitors, ATIII and TFPI. All variant enzymes were inhibited normally by these inhibitors as compared with fXaWT and second order rate constants for inhibition of fXaWT were consistent with reported values (TableII; Ref. 22Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the active site of fXa was not compromised by these mutations. Inhibition of each enzyme by ATIII was also examined in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide and full-length heparin. The second order rate constants for ATIII inhibition in the presence of full-length heparin were reduced for all variants as compared fXaWT (Table II). Rate constants for inhibition of fXaR306A and fXaE310N were modestly reduced (66% and 64% of fXaWT, respectively), whereas those for fXaR347N (12.6% of fXaWT, 12), fXaK351A (20.1%), and fXaK414A (21.1%) were markedly reduced. In contrast to these effects with full-length heparin, inhibition of all variants in the presence of the pentasaccharide was equivalent to that of fXaWT (Table II). Thus, the basic residues at positions 347, 351, and 414 likely contribute to the heparin binding site of fXa.Table IIInhibition of variant and wild type fXafXaSecond order rate constants (mean ± S.E.)ATIII2-a0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of rTFPI (0–50 nm) or ATIII (0–4 μm).ATIII/PS2-b0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of ATIII (0–50 nm) in the presence of 0.5 μm heparin pentasaccharide.ATIII/heparin2-c0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of ATIII (0–16 nm) in the presence of full-length heparin (2.5 milliunits/ml).TFPI2-a0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of rTFPI (0–50 nm) or ATIII (0–4 μm).m−1 · s−1 × 104WT0.17 ± 0.0318.5 ± 1.5185.1 ± 0.4414.2 ± 0.64K414A0.20 ± 0.0118.3 ± 0.7939.7 ± 0.539.8 ± 0.18R347N0.14 ± 0.0317.1 ± 2.523.4 ± 0.6610.7 ± 0.59E310N0.20 ± 0.0622.9 ± 0.11118.3 ± 0.8718.6 ± 0.51R306A0.17 ± 0.0329.0 ± 0.13122.2 ± 0.4016.5 ± 0.32K351A0.14 ± 0.0516.5 ± 1.337.3 ± 0.5810.7 ± 0.59Second order rate constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”2-a 0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of rTFPI (0–50 nm) or ATIII (0–4 μm).2-b 0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of ATIII (0–50 nm) in the presence of 0.5 μm heparin pentasaccharide.2-c 0.5 nm fXa was incubated with varying concentrations of ATIII (0–16 nm) in the presence of full-length heparin (2.5 milliunits/ml). Open table in a new tab Second order rate constants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The catalytic function of the enzymes was evaluated using the physiological substrate, prothrombin (Fig.2). Multiple concentrations of prothrombin were incubated with the mutant enzymes and the apparent affinity for prothrombin and catalytic turnover were compared with that of fXaWT. In the absence of cofactor and phospholipid, all variant enzymes, with the exception of fXaE310N, interact similarly with prothrombin as indicated by similarK m(app) values (rangeK m(app) = 88.4–96.4 μm). fXaE310N demonstrated a 3-fold reduction in the apparent affinity for prothrombin (fXaWT K m(app) = 91.9 μm versus fXaE310N K m(app) = 299 μm). The variation in the range of maximum prothrombin turnover rates for all enzymes is less than 2-fold (0.026–0.047 s−1), indicating that all variant enzymes have similar catalytic activity compared with fXaWT. To examine the interaction between the variant enzymes and cofactor, thrombin formation was first quantitated in the presence of fVa, but in the absence of phospholipid. All enzymes demonstrated markedly reduced function as compared with fXaWT (Fig. 3). fVa enhanced the catalytic function of fXaWT, e.g. at 10 μm prothrombin, fXaWT was catalytically more than 1000-fold faster in the presence of 250 nm fVa. The catalytic activity of the variants was also enhanced by the addition of cofactor, although not nearly to the same extent. In an effort to increase the concentration of cofactor in the presence of the enzymes, prothrombin turnover was evaluated on 100 nm PC:PS (3:1) vesicles which bind fXa and fVa and colocalize the enzyme with cofactor. Under these conditions, all variant enzymes displayed measurable function (Fig.4). Here, the apparent fVa affinity for fXaR306A and fXaE310N were only slightly reduced relative to fXaWT (fXaWT K d(app) = 106 pm, fXaR306A = 203 pm, and fXaE310N = 157 pm), whereas fXaK351A and fXaK414A demonstrated a greater reduction in cofactor affinity (fXaK351A K d(app) = 366 pm, and fXaK414A = 556 pm). As previously reported, the relative fVa affinity of fXaR347Nwas markedly reduced under these conditions (fXaR347N K d(app) = 2299 pm). Maximal turnover of prothrombin by all variant enzymes was found to be within 2-fold that of fXaWT (range, 18.9–28.9 s−1) in the presence of cofactor and phospholipid vesicles. These data are most easily explained by the hypothesis that the major effect of substitution of Arg-347, Lys-351, or Lys-414 is the reduction in fVa affinity in the presence of PC:PS vesicles with little or no impact on catalytic activity of the fVa-fXa complex.Figure 4Prothrombin activation in the presence of fVa and PC : PS vesicles. Reactions contained 20 μm PC:PS vesicles (3:1), fVa (0–1 nm), and 20 pmfXaWT (○), fXaR306A (■), fXaE310N (▾), fXaR347N (▿), fXaK351A (▪), or fXaK414A (●). Thrombin formation was initiated by the addition of 1 μmprothrombin and quantitated by incubating quenched reaction aliquots with 500 μm Spectrozyme TH™. Thrombin formation was quantitated as described in the legend to Fig. 2 and expressed as moles of thrombin (IIa)/mole of Xa/s, and the maximal turnover rate in the presence of saturating fVa is represented ask cat(Va) (s−1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the mutations only impact cofactor affinity, the full catalytic potential should be realized under ideal conditions. This hypothesis was evaluated using activated platelets, which provide an ideal phospholipid surface and saturating fVa. Indeed, under these conditions, all fXa species are very similar to fXaWT (Fig.5). To confirm the results of the functional studies and more directly probe the role of these residues in fVa binding, we employed a previously described binding assay (12Rudolph A.E. Porche-Sorbet R. Miletich J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2861-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the assay, active-site modified, radiolabeled fXa (125I-fXaS379A) was mixed with varying concentrations of unlabeled, mutant enzyme. Both enzymes were then allowed to compete for fVa binding on a PC:PS-coated latex bead. Factor Va binding is expressed for the variant enzymes in Fig.6 as the percentage of125I-fXaS379A bound to the bead in the presence of increasing concentrations of added, unlabeled fXa. fXaR306A and fXaE310N demonstrated modest reductions in fVa affinity in the assay (fXaWT K d(app) = 1.83 nm, fXaR306A = 2.96 nm, fXaE310N = 4.03 nm), whereas the relative fVa affinity of fXaK351A, fXaK414A, and fXaR347Nwas markedly reduced (K d(app) = 8.81, 12.17, and 19.45 nm, respectively). Consistent with the functional studies on phospholipid vesicles, substitution of residues Lys-351, Lys-414, and Arg-347 resulted in a selective loss of fVa affinity in the absence of prothrombin, whereas mutation of Arg-306 and Glu-310 reduced fVa binding to a much lower extent. The juxtaposition of the targeted residues is apparent from the fXa structure (Fig.7; Ref. 21Brandstetter H. Kuhne A. Bode W. Huber R. von der Saal W. Wirthensohn K. Engh R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29988-29992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Residues found to contribute to the fVa binding site are clustered in a defined region on the fXa surface in the serine protease domain. The impact of surrounding residues (Arg-273, Ile-357, Arg-406, Lys-406, and Lys-420) on fVa affinity was evaluated using the fVa-sensitive functional assays described above, i.e. in the presence and absence of PC:PS vesicles. Substitution of these residues had no impact on fVa affinity in these assays (data not shown), thereby delineating the fVa binding epitope. The current study describes substitutions in the surface epitope of fX that includes Arg-306, Glu-310, Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414. All mutants were synthesized and secreted in the expression system in a manner equivalent to that of fXWT. Activation of these zymogens by fVIIa/TF, fIXa/fVIIIa, and RVV-X, hydrolysis of a small, peptide substrate, and inhibition by TFPI and ATIII all occurred at a near-normal rates. Based on these studies, substitution of these residues does not compromise the active site structure of fXa. Heparin can accelerate the rate of fXa inhibition by ATIII by mediating conformational changes in the inhibitor and by acting as a template that binds both inhibitor and enzyme (23Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The individual contributions of structural alterations in ATIII and binding to fXa were evaluated using heparin pentasaccharide, which binds ATIII, but does not act as a template. All variant enzymes were inhibited normally by ATIII in the presence of heparin pentasaccharide. However, the rate of inhibition by ATIII in the presence of full-length heparin was reduced for all variants, indicating that these residues contribute to the heparin binding capacity of fXa. Substitution of the glutamic acid at position 310 results in the addition of a carbohydrate group, which could sterically hinder the binding of heparin to the fXa surface. Substitution of the basic residues at positions 347, 351, 414, and 306 likely attenuates ionic interactions between heparin and fXa. These data are corroborated by structural analysis of thrombin and fXa. Lys-351 and Lys-414 are adjacent to the analogous epitope defined in thrombin as the heparin binding exosite (24Sheehan J.P. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5518-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, Padmanabhan and co-workers (25Padmanabhan K. Padmanabha K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) have described the heparin binding domain of fX as a large basic region, which either includes or is adjacent to these residues. Delineation of the entire heparin binding domain of fXa will require additional mutagenesis. All variant enzymes bound and activated prothrombin in a manner similar to fXaWT with one exception, fXaE310N. The apparent affinity of fXaE310N for prothrombin was 3-fold lower than fXaWT. It is conceivable that the added carbohydrate sterically hinders substrate binding. Alternatively, the added sugar may restrict conformational mobility of fXa and prevent the enzyme from adapting a favorable conformation for substrate binding in the absence of a lipid surface. This study examined the independent interactions between fXa and other prothrombinase complex constituents. It was found that the sensitivity to aberrant fVa binding is heightened under suboptimal conditions for prothrombin turnover, i.e. in the presence of fVa ± PC:PS vesicles, allowing clear delineation of the residues that compose the fVa binding site. As expected, substitutions of residues that comprise the core binding site result in a more severe phenotype as compared with mutations in the residues that form the extended regions of the site. The power of this methodology is exemplified by fXaR306A and fXaE310N, which displayed a reduced function in the absence of phospholipid. On addition of PC:PS vesicles, which increase the local concentration of prothrombinase complex components and maximize productive interactions, these enzymes bind fVa with a similar apparent affinity to fXaWT. In contrast, the phenotype of fXaR347N, fXaK351A, and fXaK414A was only overcome under the ideal conditions of activated platelets, suggesting a more critical role of these residues in fVa binding. Therefore, Arg-306 and Glu-310 may form part of the binding site that extends beyond the core epitope whereas Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414 likely contribute to the core of the binding epitope. It has been proposed that fVa mediates conformational changes in fXa that contribute to the cofactor-driven enhancement of prothrombin activation (11Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Husten J.E. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol.

In the absence of a phospholipid surface, cofactor enhanced the activity of fXaWT, but had little effect on the variant enzymes. There are at least two possible explanations for these data. Either the mutations compromised the functional capacity of fXa by attenuating these proposed cofactor-mediated structural rearrangements, or fVa binding is impaired by the mutations. If these structural rearrangements are attenuated by the substitutions, the aberrant phenotype would not likely be overcome even under optimal conditions for substrate turnover. It was demonstrated that mutant enzymes with less severe phenotypes (fXaE310N and fXaR306A) can function nearly normally on a PC:PS vesicle surface in the presence of fVa and the function of all mutant enzymes was similar to the wild-type enzyme under the conditions provided by activated platelets. Moreover, the competition binding assay, which directly probes cofactor binding, demonstrated a more marked loss of fVa affinity for variant enzymes with more severe phenotypes in the functional assays. The data do not support the postulate that substitution of these residues prevented fVa-mediated changes in the fXa structure, but rather that the fVa affinity is selectively attenuated by the mutations. Analysis of the tertiary structure of fXa provides compelling structural support for the existence of a fVa binding epitope in the serine protease domain of fXa. Using peptide mapping studies, Chattopadhyay et al. (30Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified three regions of fXa that were found to contribute to fVa binding: 211–222, 254–269, and 263–274 (30Chattopadhyay A. James H.L. Fair D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12323-12329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these regions was evaluated by mutagenesis using functional assays and found not to contribute to fVa binding (data not shown). The discrepancy between the studies may reflect differences in methodologies. The region identified by the current study has also been described as a cofactor binding site for other coagulation enzymes. For example, the analogous surface loop of fIXa, which corresponds to residues 344–352 in fXa, was recently identified to form a binding epitope for fVIIIa (31Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, Banner et al. (29Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) identified multiple regions of the fVIIa surface that contribute to TF binding including one region analogous to fX residues 346–349. Targeted mutagenesis of the residues that surround the proposed cofactor binding epitope was also conducted as part of this study. It was found that residues Arg-273, Ile-357, Arg-406, Lys-406, and Lys-420 do not contribute to fVa binding, but rather outline the fVa binding epitope. Based on this survey of adjacent epitopes, structural examination, and comparisons to other cofactor binding epitopes, it is likely that Arg-347, Lys-351, and Lys-414 form the core of a fVa binding epitope of fXa, which is extended to include Arg-306 and Glu-310.

To date, two potential in vivo substrates of Akt1 have been identified, namely glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and BAD (4Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). GSK3 is inhibited by Akt1, which is thought to contribute to the insulin-induced dephosphorylation (activation) of glycogen synthase and protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2B and thereby to the stimulation of glycogen synthesis and protein synthesis (4Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the cellular targets that Akt1 may phosphorylate to protect cells from apoptosis is BAD (7Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

This protein, in its dephosphorylated form, interacts with the Bcl family member BclXL and induces apoptosis of some cells; however, BAD, which is phosphorylated by Akt1, dissociates from BclXL, instead of interacting with 14-3-3, to prevent apoptosis (9Zha J.

Furthermore, in transfection-based experiments, constitutively active Akt1 also mimics other actions of insulin, such as the enhancement of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10Kohn A.D.

Although several lines of evidence suggest that Akt1 may be activated by products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, such as phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (12Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar), other studies have shown that the activation of this enzyme results primarily from phosphorylation (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Akt1 has an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and two major phosphorylation sites, Thr-308 and Ser-473. PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which are produced by growth factor-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase, induced membrane localization of Akt1 via its PH domain. This event allows phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 and Ser-473 by the upstream kinase (14Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F.

To investigate the role of PDK1 in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 and Ser-473 in vivo, wild-type PDK1 (wt-PDK1) or its kinase dead mutant (kd-PDK1) was expressed using an adenovirus gene transduction system in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing insulin receptor (CHO-IR). We report herein a novel mechanism of Akt1 dephosphorylation in which PDK1, an Akt1 kinase, is involved.

Chinese hamster ovary cells in which the insulin receptor is stably overexpressed (CHO-IR cells) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

CHO-IR cells were incubated in Ham's F-12 medium containing the adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10–30 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h at 37 °C, and the growth medium was then added. Experiments were performed 48–72 h after infection. Exogenous protein expression was observed in more than 90% of CHO-IR cells. Cells, which had been serum-starved and then incubated with or without 1 μm insulin, were lysed and boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 25 nm calyculin A as indicated in the text. The filters were incubated with the indicated antibodies and then with anti-rabbit or anti-sheep immunoglobulin G coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The immunoblots were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensities of bands were quantified by NIH Image 1.62 program.

Lysates were extracted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. The Ser/Thr kinase activity of the wild-type Akt1 was assayed in the immunoprecipitates as previously reported (25Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

The cells were homogenized with by 8 passages through a 29-gauge needle and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the particulate fractions from cytosolic fractions (26Begum N. J. Biol.

PP1 and PP2A activities were assayed in the particulate fractions and cytosolic fractions using a protein serine/threonine phosphatase assay system (New England Biolabs). The activities of PP1 and PP2A were distinguished by their differential sensitivities to okadaic acid (OA). PP1 activity was defined as the activity that was insensitive to 5 nm OA. PP2A and PP2A-like activities were defined as the activity that was inhibited by 5 nm OA. As a control, protein phosphatase activity was also measured in the presence of 1 μm OA, which completely inhibits both PP1 and PP2A (27Yan Y. Mumby M.C. J. Biol.

To investigate the effects of PDK1 activity on Akt1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473, the wild-type (wt) PDK1 or the kinase-dead (kd) mutant of PDK1 was expressed into CHO-IR cells using an adenovirus gene transduction system, followed by immunoblotting using Thr-308 and Ser-473 phospho-specific antibodies. In parental CHO-IR cells, however, it was difficult to detect constantly the phosphorylation of endogenous Akt1 at Thr-308 with immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Akt1 (Thr-308) antibody (data not shown). Therefore, the experiments were performed in CHO-IR cells coexpressing the wild-type Akt1 tagged with Myc epitope using an adenovirus gene transduction system. First, in CHO-IR cells expressing wt-Akt1 alone (A cells), those expressing wt-PDK1 and wt-Akt1 (wtPA cells), and those expressing kd-PDK1 and wt-Akt1 (kdPA cells), the Ser/Thr kinase activity of PDK1 was measured in the immunoprecipitates with anti-tag antibody (Fig.1 A) or anti-PDK1 antibody (Fig. 1 B). Exogenous PDK1 proteins were also expressed at similar levels in wtPA cells and kdPA cells (Fig. 1 C). Insulin did not stimulate either endogenous or exogenous PDK1 (Fig. 1,A and B). Overexpression of wt-PDK1 markedly increased kinase activity to 6-fold (Fig. 1 B), which was consistent with the marked increase (approximately 8-fold) in the expression level of wt-PDK1 as demonstrated by immunoblotting with anti-PDK1 antibody (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, kd-PDK1 exhibited no significant kinase activity (Fig. 1 A). In addition, expression of kd-PDK1 did not affect endogenous PDK1 activity (Fig.1 B), demonstrating that the mutant does not have a dominant inhibitory effect on the Ser/Thr kinase activity of endogenous PDK1. Next, we examined the effects of expression of wt-PDK1 or kd-PDK1 on the phosphorylation states of Akt1 at Thr-308 and Ser-473 after 15 min of insulin stimulation. By adjusting the transfection conditions including m.o.i., wt-Akt was expressed at a level similar to that in A cells, wtPA cells, and kdPA cells, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with anti-tag antibody (Fig.2 C). Insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 was not observed in A cells (Fig.2 A). Overexpression of wt-PDK1 slightly enhanced insulin-stimulated Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt1 (Fig.2 A). To our surprise, a marked increase (an approximately 4-fold increase compared with the value in wtPA cells) was observed in the insulin-induced phosphorylation at Thr-308 in kdPA cells 15 min after insulin addition (Fig. 2 A), despite the absence of activity of kd-PDK1 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the change in Thr-308 phosphorylation state, insulin-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt1 was clearly observed in A cells, and overexpression of wt-PDK1 or kd-PDK1 had virtually no effect on its change in phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). To confirm the involvement of kd-PDK1 in the enhancement of Thr-308 phosphorylation, we examined Thr-308 phosphorylation in CHO-IR cells with different kd-PDK1 expression levels after 15 min of insulin stimulation. Different levels of kd-PDK1 expression were achieved by infection of CHO-IR cells with kd-PDK1 adenovirus at different multiplicities (Fig.3 B), whereas wt-Akt1 was expressed at similar levels in these cells in response to infection with Akt1 adenovirus at similar multiplicities (Fig. 3 C). The levels of Thr-308 phosphorylation were dependent on those of kd-PDK1 expression (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings indicate that kd-PDK1 expression enhances Thr-308 phosphorylation after 15 min of insulin stimulation. An approximately 3-fold increase in the level of Thr-308 phosphorylation was observed at 30 m.o.i. as compared with that at 20 m.o.i., whereas kd-PDK1 expression was increased less than 1.5-fold. This may be attributable to the mechanism whereby kd-PDK1 functions as a dominant inhibitory mutant for dephosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308.Figure 3Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt1 in CHO-IR cells with different expression levels of kd-PDK1 after 15 min of insulin stimulation. CHO-IR cells coexpressing both wt-Akt1 and kd-PDK1, whose kd-PDK1 expression levels were different (m.o.i. 30, 20, and 10), were incubated with or without 1 μm insulin for 15 min. Lysates were immunoblotted (Blot) with anti-phospho-Akt1 (Thr-308) antibody (A), anti-HA (B), and anti-Myc antibody (C), and densitometry was performed on the original blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The graphs show the intensities of bands, and data are expressed as percentages of the intensities in cells infected with kd-PDK1 adenovirus at 30 m.o.i. Values presented are the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments. The representative immunoblotting figures are also presented (upper panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Contrary to our expectation, expression of kd-PDK1, which exhibited no kinase activity (Fig. 1 A), resulted in further enhancement of Thr-308 phosphorylation compared with expression of wt-PDK1 at 15 min of insulin addition (Fig. 2 A). To clarify the mechanism underlying this unexpected observation, we examined the phosphorylation states of Thr-308 and Ser-473 at earlier time points, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min after insulin addition. Immunoblotting study revealed that Thr-308 was already maximally phosphorylated at 1 min after insulin addition but almost completely dephosphorylated by 5 min in A cells (Fig. 4 A). In wtPA cells, phosphorylation of Thr-308 was markedly increased (∼1.8-fold) at 1 min after insulin addition, compared with A cells, but Thr-308 phosphorylation was also rapidly reversed (Fig. 4 B). Akt1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 occurred in kdPA cells and was similar to that observed in A cells, at 1 min after insulin addition. However, the phosphorylation was maintained at 15 min (Fig. 4 C) with even higher Thr-308 phosphorylation in kdPA cells (∼3.8-fold) than in wtPA cells. These results suggest that overexpression of wt-PDK1 enhances Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt1 at earlier time points, such as 1 min, and that expression of kd-PDK1 inhibits dephosphorylation but does not affect phosphorylation. On the other hand, phosphorylation of Ser-473, which was observed at 1 min after insulin addition, was maintained even at 15 min of insulin stimulation in A cells (Fig. 4 D). Overexpression of wt-PDK1 or kd-PDK1 had no significant effects on insulin-induced Ser-473 phosphorylation throughout 15 min of insulin addition (Fig. 4,E and F). Thus, PDK1 is clearly involved in Thr-308 phosphorylation, whereas Ser-473 phosphorylation appears to be accomplished through a different mechanism in vivo. Recent findings have shown that phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 is necessary for full activation of Akt1 (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between the phosphorylation states of these residues and the Ser/Thr kinase activity of Akt1, we examined the time course of Akt1 activity in these cells. In A cells, activation of Akt1 was observed at 1 min after insulin addition and was maintained even at 15 min (Fig. 5, dotted line). Overexpression of wt-PDK1 enhanced insulin-induced activation of Akt1, and this enhanced activity was maintained for 15 min (Fig. 5,dashed line), whereas overexpression of kd-PDK1 did not appear to affect insulin-stimulated Akt1 activity (Fig. 5, solid line); Akt1 activity was increased to similar extents in A cells and kdPA cells. Comparison of the time course of Akt1 activation (Fig.5) with that of Thr-308 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A–C) shows clearly that phosphorylation of Thr-308 is not essential for maintaining Akt1 activity once it has been initiated. To unravel the mechanism whereby Thr-308 is dephosphorylated, we examined the effects of a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, on the Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt. Calyculin A is reportedly cell-permeable and equally inhibits protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and PP2A in vivo (29MacKintosh C. MacKintosh R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 444-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). When A cells were pretreated with 25 nm calyculin A for 15 min, Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt1 was prolonged even at 15 min after insulin addition (Fig.6 A), which resembled the observation in kdPA cells (Fig. 4 C). These findings suggest that expression of kd-PDK1 inhibits protein phosphatase activity, resulting in the maintenance of Thr-308 phosphorylation. Inhibition of Thr-308 dephosphorylation by calyculin A indicates that PP1 and/or PP2A is involved in Thr-308 dephosphorylation. We examined whether PP1 or PP2A activity is affected by insulin treatment and expression of wt-PDK1 or kd-PDK1. PP1 or PP2A activity was estimated in particulate and cytosolic fractions from CHO-IR cells, those expressing wt-PDK1, and those expressing kd-PDK1, with or without insulin using appropriate concentrations of okadaic acids as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No significant differences in PP1 or PP2A activity were observed in each fraction either among these cells or between the basal state and insulin-stimulated states (data not shown). Then, we further examined which phosphatase was capable of dephosphorylating Akt1 at Thr-308 in vitro. The phosphorylated Akt1, stimulated by insulin, was incubated with purified PP1 or PP2A in vitro, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt1 (Thr-308) antibody. Thr-308 phosphorylation completely abolished by treatment with PP2A, whereas it persisted, although at a decreased level, with PP1 treatment (Fig. 6 B). Thus, phosphorylated Thr-308 of Akt1 is a more preferable substrate for PP2A than for PP1. Taken together with the findings obtained usingin vivo calyculin A treatment and in vitro dephosphorylation experiments, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 might be reversed by PP2A, although we cannot rule out the possibility that another unknown phosphatase, which is inhibited by calyculin A, is involved. In response to growth factor stimulation, Akt1 becomes phosphorylated at two major sites, Thr-308 in the kinase domain and Ser-473 in the C-terminal tail (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). PDK1 is a recently identified protein kinase that phosphorylates Akt1 at Thr-308 in lipid vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2(18Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of PDK1 in 293 cells reportedly potentiated the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 in vivo(15Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed overexpression of wt-PDK1 to potentiate the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 at 1 min, but this was rapidly followed by dephosphorylation. In contrast, wt-PDK1 overexpression did not affect Ser-473 phosphorylation in the basal or insulin-stimulated condition. Furthermore, kd-PDK1 expression did not apparently affect Ser-473 phosphorylation. Thus, PDK1 is clearly involved in Thr-308 phosphorylation, whereas Ser-473 phosphorylation appears to occur through a different mechanism in vivo. Contrary to our expectation, expression of the kinase dead mutant of PDK1 did not inhibit but rather maintained the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr-308. In addition, the levels of Thr-308 phosphorylation paralleled those of kd-PDK1 expression. Furthermore, calyculin A, an inhibitor of both PP1 and PP2A, prolonged the phosphorylation state of Thr-308. Thus, kd-PDK1 expression has a dominant inhibitory effect on Ser/Thr protein phosphatase for Thr-308 of Akt1, suggesting that PDK1, an Akt kinase, also regulates dephosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308, resulting in a transient Thr-308 phosphorylation in CHO-IR cells. It was reported that phosphorylation of Thr-308 of Akt1 was observed at 10 min after insulin (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) and IGF-1 (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 15Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) stimulation in 293 cells. We also observed the persistent phosphorylation of Thr-308 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes at 15 min after insulin stimulation (data not shown). However, in CHO-IR cells, at a more modest insulin concentration (10 nm), phosphorylation of Thr-308 was rapidly reversed, and kd-PDK1 expression prolonged Akt1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 (see Supplemental Material) in a fashion similar to that observed at 1 μm insulin (Fig. 4,A and C). Thus, it is unlikely that the markedly transient phosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308 involves inappropriate coupling of insulin receptors to intracellular targets and/or effects of insulin binding nonspecifically to related receptors. The discrepancy among cell types might be due to differences in the levels of expression and/or subcellular distribution of putative signaling molecules that transduce signals from PDK1 to the downstream phosphatase. It appears that overexpression of PDK1 is less effective in the dephosphorylation of Thr-308 than in the phosphorylation of this residue, since the levels of Akt1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 were higher, at all times after insulin stimulation, in wtPA cells (Fig.4 B) than in A cells (Fig. 4 A). Whereas PDK1 directly phosphorylates Thr-308 of Akt1, dephosphorylation of Thr-308 perhaps occurs via endogenous phosphatase activation. Therefore, this discrepancy between the effects of PDK1 on phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Thr-308 might be attributable to endogenous phosphatase activity possibly being rate-limiting for dephosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308, under conditions of wt-PDK1 overexpression. Based on biochemical characteristics, Ser/Thr protein phosphatases were initially divided into two classes; type 1 phosphatases (PP1) are inhibited by two heat-stable proteins, termed inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2, and preferentially dephosphorylate the β-subunit of phosphorylase kinase, whereas type-2 phosphatases are insensitive to heat-stable inhibitors and preferentially dephosphorylate the α-subunit of phosphorylase kinase (30Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar, 31Ingebritsen T.S. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Type 2 phosphatases can be further subdivided into spontaneously active (PP2A), Ca2+-dependent (PP2B), and Mg2+-dependent (PP2C) classes (32Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). More than 30 protein kinase activities are known to be modulated by PP2A in vitro (33Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), suggesting that PP2A plays a major role in kinase regulation. In fact, extensive biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic evidence suggests that PP2A controls the activities of several major protein kinase families, particularly those that belong to the AGC subgroup, the calmodulin-dependent kinases (34DeRemer M.F.

Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown treatment of Akt1 with PP2Ain vitro to inactivate kinase (28Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.F. Han J.W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), its exact phosphorylation states of Thr-308 and Ser-473 in vivo remain unclear. In the present study, we showed calyculin A to inhibit dephosphorylation of Akt1 at Thr-308, which occurred in a fashion similar to that of kd-PDK1 expression. In addition, under conditions of identical enzyme activity, PP2A completely dephosphorylated Akt1 at Thr-308 in vitro, whereas Thr-308 of Akt1 was not completely dephosphorylated by PP1 despite the loose substrate specificity of the catalytic subunit of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (32Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). These results suggest that phosphorylated Akt1 at Thr-308 is a more preferable substrate for PP2A than for PP1. These findings are in agreement with the recent report that PP2A is the major protein phosphatase responsible for hyperosmotic stress-induced dephosphorylation of Akt1 at both Thr-308 and Ser-473 (43Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured the PP2A activity, but we detected no insulin stimulation of PP2A activity in CHO-IR cells. In addition, overexpression of the wild-type or kinase-dead PDK1 also had no effect on PP2A activity (data not shown). However, Begum and co-workers (44Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Begum N. Robinson L.J. Draznin B. Heidenreich K.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) have recently shown that addition of insulin to rat skeletal muscle cells decreases PP2A activity by 40–80% (44Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in fetal chick neurons, insulin increases PP2A activity (45Begum N. Robinson L.J. Draznin B. Heidenreich K.A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although differences in these results may depend on cell types, these reports suggest that PP2A activity can be modulated by extracellular signals such as insulin. PP2A is a multimeric protein, and the catalytic subunit of PP2A forms a complex with an array of regulatory subunits that modulate its activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization (33Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The phosphatase activity assay in extracts from whole cells does not necessarily reflect the PP2A activity in the specific subcellular loci. Thus, the lack of a significant change in the PP2A activity of whole cytosolic and particulate fractions does not exclude the possibility that, upon insulin stimulation, PP2A in specific subcellular loci is activated downstream from PDK1 in response to insulin in vivo. The proportion of the regulatable PP2A might be different in other cell types. Alternatively, it is also possible that, without altering phosphatase activity, a portion of PP2A changes subcellular localization upon insulin stimulation, thereby gaining access to the phosphorylated Akt1 at Thr-308, and this cellular process is inhibited by kd-PDK1. It was reported that mutation of either Thr-308 or Ser-473 to Ala greatly decreased the activation of transfected Akt1 by insulin. In addition, Akt1 became partially active in vitro when either Thr-308 or Ser-473 was changed to Asp, and far more active when Thr-308 and Ser-473 were both mutated to Asp, suggesting a critical role of phosphorylation of both the Thr-308 and the Ser-473 residues in full activation of Akt1 (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, Akt1 activation was prolonged even after dephosphorylation of Thr-308, although basal and insulin-stimulated Akt1 activities were enhanced by overexpression of wt-PDK1. Thus, a discrepancy was observed between the Akt1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Akt1 activity. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-473 was prolonged in a fashion similar to that of Akt1 activity. These findings suggest that initial activation of Akt1 depends on its phosphorylation states, including that of Thr-308, whereas the maintenance of once activated Akt1 activity is via a mechanism different from that of initial activation. Thr-308 phosphorylation is not essential for maintenance of the Akt1 activity, in which Ser-473 phosphorylation might be involved. PDK1 reportedly phosphorylates the activation loop of PKCα and PKCβII, which is homologous to the sequence around Thr-308 of Akt1, and this phosphorylation is a step required for the maturation of PKCα and PKCβII. This phosphorylation serves as a trigger to induce the two C-terminal autophosphorylations that are required to lock PKC in a catalytically competent conformation, resulting in full activation. Once this mature conformation is achieved, the phosphate group on the activation loop does not regulate the activity of the enzyme (46Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Thr-308 of Akt1, like phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKCα and PKCβII by PDK1, may serve as a trigger for maturation of Akt1, although phosphorylation of Thr-308 of Akt1 does not lead to autophosphorylation of its Ser-473 (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). It was reported that kd-PDK1 does not interfere with PKC activator (phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+)- induced PKCα and PKCβII activation (46Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). On the other hand, kd-PDK1 has a dominant negative effect on PKC activator (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3)-induced PKCζ (41Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insulin-induced p70 S6-kinase activation (42Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In the present study, kd-PDK1 was shown to have a dominant inhibitory effect on dephosphorylation of Akt1 but not on phosphorylation of the same molecule or on endogenous PDK1 activity. These observations suggest that mechanisms whereby PDK1 transduces signals to downstream targets depend on the target molecule. In summary, we have reported herein that, upon insulin stimulation, phosphorylated Thr-308 of Akt1 is rapidly dephosphorylated downstream from PDK1, an Akt kinase, and that phosphorylation of Thr-308 is not essential for maintaining the Akt1 activity once it has been achieved.

In the present study, we analyzed the role of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in the induction of TNF-α by glass fibers. Glass fibers induced phosphorylation of MAP kinases, p38, and ERK in primary rat alveolar macrophages, and this phosphorylation was associated with TNF-α gene expression. Long fibers were more potent than short fibers in activation of MAP kinases. Results from mechanistic analysis support that MAP kinases activate transcription factor c-Jun. The activated c-Jun acts on the TNF-α gene promoter through two binding sites, the cyclic AMP response element and the activator protein 1-binding site. These results suggest that in addition to the NF-κB pathway for TNF-α production, glass fibers are able to activate c-Jun through MAP kinase pathways that lead to induction of TNF-α expression.

The health effects of glass fibers remain to be fully investigated. Recently, a classifier has been developed to separate fibers by length using dielectrophoresis that involves the movement of neutral particles in a gradient electric field (1Baron P.A. Deye G.J.

To this end, we have studied the biological activity of JM-100 glass fibers on macrophages and found that fiber length is a very important factor in toxicity and stimulation of macrophages (3Castranova V.

Biological effects of glass fibers of two different lengths (7 and 17 μm) have been previously studied by our laboratory (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Long fibers were more potent than short fibers in the activation of NF-κB and the induction of TNF-α1 production. Macrophages serve as sensors to external stimulation in the defense system of the body. Reaction of macrophages to glass fibers may be the first response in the lung when glass fibers are inhaled. The activated macrophages pass signals to other cells by releasing intercellular signal mediators, such as cytokines and free radicals (6Driscoll K.E. Lindenschmidt R.C. Maurer J.K. Higgins J.M.

Thorax. 1993; 48: 931-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we observed that macrophage engulfed glass fibers and released TNF-α upon exposure to glass fibers (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNF-α is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by macrophages. TNF-α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by stimulating proliferation of fibroblasts and production of collagen matrix (6Driscoll K.E. Lindenschmidt R.C. Maurer J.K.

TNF-α expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Transcription of TNF-α is controlled by multiple enhancer elements such as the κ3 site (a NF-κB binding site), cAMP response element (CRE), and AP-1-binding site. Activities of these enhancers are regulated by several transcription factors, including NF-κB (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V.

It has been widely accepted that both the κ3 site and CRE are required for a maximal induction of TNF-α transcription, and a synergy between these two elements is necessary (12Tsai E.Y. Jain J. Pesavento P.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the κ3 site was involved in induction of TNF-α by glass fibers (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by many stress signals (16Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 17Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). MAP kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in signal transduction of many extracellular stimuli, including UV light, bacterial derivatives, and growth factors. The major members in the MAP kinase family are extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 kinase, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 19Marshall C.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Activation of these kinases is marked by phosphorylation of serine/threonine amino residues in their protein molecule. ERK, p38, and JNK are cytoplasmic proteins. They act as signal transducers at the end of kinase cascades that mediate signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Activation of ERK, p38, and JNK leads to induction of transcription factors that in turn regulate target gene expression in the nucleus. The nuclear proteins, such as c-Jun, ATF-2, and ElK1, are the major transcription factors that are regulated by the three MAP kinases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to act as MAP kinases activators (16Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 17Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 21Ding M. Dong Z. Chen F. Pack D. Ma W.Y. Ye J. Shi X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1884-1889PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study has demonstrated that fiber-induced ROS were required for TNF-α production in a murine macrophage cell line (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study focuses on the involvement of MAP kinase signal transduction pathway in fiber-stimulated TNF-α production by rat alveolar macrophages. MAP kinases can be activated by ROS in variety of conditions, including UV light (16Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 22Davis R.J.

Vallyathan V. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1884-1889PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that MAP kinases will be activated by glass fiber-induced ROS and that they play a role in glass fiber-induced TNF-α production. This hypothesis is tested in the current study. Rat alveolar macrophages were used for analysis of MAP kinase activity after glass fiber exposure. The following questions are addressed: (a) Do glass fibers induce TNF-α production in the rat alveolar macrophages? (b) Do MAP kinases play a role in glass fiber-induced TNF-α expression? (c) In addition to NF-κB, are other nuclear factors, such as members of the AP-1 family, involved in glass fiber signaling? (d) How do AP-1 family members regulate the TNF-α gene promoter. Bulk samples of JM-100 glass fibers (Manville code 100 supplied by the manufacturer) were first milled, aerosolized, and separated into two length categories using dielectrophoresis (1Baron P.A. Deye G.J. Frernback J. Aerosol Sci. Technol. 1994; 21: 179-192Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Deye G.J. Gao P. Baron P.A. Fernback J. Aerosol Sci. Technol. 1999; 30: 420-437Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The dielectrophoretic classifier was operated in a differential mode so that fibers with narrow length distributions were extracted in an air suspension at the end of the classifier. These size-selected fiber samples were collected on polycarbonate (Nuclepore) filters at rates up to 1 mg/day. Fibers were scraped off the filters for microscopic analysis and for biological experiments. Samples of the length-classified fibers were prepared for size and count analysis by adding weighed portions of the dusts to freshly filtered water. These samples were then sonicated, diluted, and filtered through polycarbonate filters. Measurements of length, width, and fiber count/mass were made using a JEOL JSM-6400 scanning electron microscope (4Blake T. Castranova V. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Jones W. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1998; 54: 243-259Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Measurements at each magnification were referenced to a National Institute of Standards and Technology electron microscopy standard rule. In this study, glass fiber samples with lengths (means ± S.D.) of 7 μm (6.5 ± 2.7) and 17 μm (16.7 ± 10.6), respectively, were used to evaluate fiber effects on macrophages. Concentrations of the glass fibers used in these experiments were determined as fiber counts/ml. The glass fiber counts/mg were 3.0 × 108and 2.0 × 107 for 7- and 17-μm fiber samples, respectively (4Blake T. Castranova V. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Jones W. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1998; 54: 243-259Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The glass fiber samples were heat-treated at 120 °C for 2 h and stored under sterile conditions at room temperature. Before each experiment, the glass fibers were suspended and sonicated in the complete cell culture medium and then added to cells. The endotoxin content of the glass fiber samples was measured using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (24Luoto K. Holopainen M. Kangas J. Kalliokoski P. Savolainen K. Environ. Res. 1995; 70: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Values ranged from 0.7 to 1.69 endotoxin units/mg. These values are orders magnitude lower than those found with cotton dust (1000–2000 endotoxin units/mg) or agriculture dusts (46–4000 endotoxin units/mg) where endotoxin is thought to play a role (25Castranova V. Robison V.A. Burger M.W. Muy J.J. Dennis J.W. Jones W. Whitmer M. Siegel P.D. Frazer D.G. Domelsmith L.N. Jacobs R.R. Wakelyn P.J. Proceeding of 16th Cotton Dust Research Conference. National Cotton Council, Memphis, TN1992: 251-256Google Scholar). The maximum dose of glass fiber used in this study was 75 μg/ml. Therefore, the maximum endotoxin concentration in this study was 0.013 ng/ml. This dose of endotoxin had no effect on TNF-α production by macrophages because the minimum effective dose of endotoxin is 1 ng/ml in this experiment system (data not shown). Therefore, the fiber results reported here cannot be attributed to endotoxin contamination. Pathogen free male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats purchased from Hilltop Labs (Scottsdale, PA) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbitol (45 mg/rat) and then sacrificed by cutting the renal artery. Following tracheal cannulation, cold sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) was used to lavage the lungs at a volume of 6 ml for first lavage and 8 ml for subsequent lavages. Approximately 80 ml of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected per rat in sterile tubes. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells were washed twice in PBS by alternate centrifugation and resuspension. Bronchoalveolar lavage cells from different rats were pooled in sterile HEPES buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Cell counts were performed using an electronic cell counter equipped with a cell sizing attachment (Coulter model Multisizer II with a 256C channelizer, Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). The number of alveolar macrophages was determined by their characteristic cell diameter (26Castranova V. Kang J.H. Ma J.K. Mo C.G. Malanga C.J. Moore M.D. Schwegler-Berry D. Ma J.Y. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1991; 108: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A rat alveolar macrophage cell line (NR8383) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Masassas, VA). The cells were maintained in complete medium containing Dubecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Supershift antibodies against c-Jun (sc-44 X), c-Fos (sc-52 X), ATF-1 (sc-241 X), ATF-2 (sc-187 X), CREB1 (sc-186 X), and CREB2 (sc-200 X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The MEK inhibitor (PD 98059; catalog number 513000), which prevents phosphorylation of ERK by MEK, and p38 inhibitor (SB203580; catalog number 559389) were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation (San Diego, CA). PD 98059 and SB 203580 were dissolved in Me2SO and used to treat cells with a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%. In all experiments where the inhibitors were used, Me2SO was used at the same concentration in the controls. Rat alveolar macrophages were plated in a 96-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well in 200 μl of sterile Eagle's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the adherent cells were washed three times with warm sterile PBS and then cultured in 200 μl of fresh Eagle's modified essential medium. Before exposure to glass fibers, some cells were pretreated with MAP kinase inhibitors for 1 h. The cell culture supernatant was harvested after overnight exposure to glass fibers at a cell to fiber ratio of 1:5, which resulted in an optimal TNF-α production (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then combined from triplicated wells. The supernatant was diluted 20-fold and used in the TNF-α ELISA according to the manufacturer's instruction. An ELISA kit (catalog number KRC3010-SB) from BIOSOURCEInternational (Camarillo, CA) was used to determine rat TNF-α. Rat alveolar macrophages were plated in a 6-well plate at 3 × 106/well in 2 ml of Eagle's modified essential medium. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the adherent cells were washed three times with warm sterile PBS and then exposed to glass fibers (cell to fiber ratio of 1:5) in 2 ml of fresh Eagle's modified essential medium. After a 2-h exposure, cells were washed once in PBS and lysed in 200 μm lysis buffer for Western blot assay. Activation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase was determined by their phosphorylation status detected with phospho-specific MAP kinase antibodies. The ERK MAP kinase assay kit (catalog number 9800) and the p38 MAP kinase assay kit (catalog number 9820) from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA) were utilized in this study. Phospho-specific (catalog number sc-6254) and nonphospho-specific (catalog number sc-1648) anti-JNK antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used to detect JNK activity. The signal in Western blot was quantitated using a densitometer and normalized for protein loading. A CRE binding sequence (−112TCCAGATGAGCTCATGGGTT−92) in the TNF-α promoter was used to synthesize an oligonucleotide for the CRE probe. The AP-1 binding element in the collagenase gene promoter was used as an AP-1 probe to examine the AP-1 binding activity (27Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The double-stranded probe was labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The nuclear extracts were prepared by a three-step procedure (27Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The harvested cells were treated with a lysis buffer. The collected nuclei were washed once in a washing buffer and then treated with an extraction buffer. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was harvested as the nuclear protein extract and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The DNA-protein binding reaction was conducted in a 24-μl reaction mixture including 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 3 μg of nuclear protein extract, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, 4 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe, and 12 μl of reaction buffer (24% glycerol, 24 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 8 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) (27Ye J. Cippitelli M. Dorman L. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In some cases, the indicated amount of double-stranded oligomer was added as a cold competitor. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 10 or 20 min (with or without an antibody) in the absence of radiolabeled probe. After addition of the radiolabeled probe, the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then resolved on a 5–6% acrylamide gel that had been prerun at 170 V for 30 min with 0.5 × TBE buffer. The loaded gel was run at 200 V for 90 min, then dried, and placed on Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The TNF-α reporter gene vector used in this study was a gift of Dr. Fan at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, CA) (14Yao J. Mackman N. Edgington T.S. Fan S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17795-17801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The luciferase vector contains a promoter fragment (−615/+15) of the human TNF-α gene. The NR8383 cells (1 × 106/well) were plated in 24-well plates for 16 h before transfection. The TNF reporter DNA (0.5 μg) and a cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase expression vector (0.1 μg) were delivered into the cells by LipofactAMINE reagent (catalog number 18324-020; Life Technologies, Inc.). After transfection, the cells were washed once in PBS solution and cultured in 1 ml of the complete medium at 37 °C for 24 h. After being exposed to glass fibers for an additional 16 h, the cells were harvested for the reporter assay. The luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and then normalized by the internal control β-galactosidase and the protein content. The data for TNF-α production and activation of the TNF-α promoter were presented as mean values ± standard deviations of three individual experiments. Results were analyzed by the Student's t test at a confidence level of p ≤ 0.05. In our previous study, murine peritoneal macrophages (Raw 264.7 cells) were used to study TNF-α production after exposure to size-classified glass fiber samples (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study attempted to elucidate a role of MAP kinases in glass fiber-induced TNF-α production using rat alveolar macrophages. Short (7 μm) or long (17 μm) glass fibers were used to stimulate TNF-α production by rat alveolar macrophages, and TNF-α protein was determined by an ELISA after a 16-h exposure to the glass fibers. The results show that glass fibers can induce TNF-α production in rat alveolar macrophages and that short and long fibers exhibited different stimulatory potencies (Fig.1 A). The long fiber sample was twice as potent in stimulation of TNF-α production compared with the short fiber sample (7 μm length). It is known that MAP kinases are involved in cell stress response (16Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Because ROS were involved in glass fiber-induced TNF-α production (5Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castranova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the glass fibers activate MAP kinases in macrophages. The role of MAP kinases was explored by using specific MAP kinase inhibitors. The cells were pretreated with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) for 1 h before exposure to glass fibers. SB203580 and PD98059 were added to the cell culture at a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%. Me2SO was used as a control. The results show that TNF-α production was decreased by both inhibitors. The p38 or MEK inhibitor resulted in 60 or 40% inhibition, respectively (Fig. 1 B). This inhibition was not from Me2SO because Me2SO did not exhibit any inhibitory effect at this concentration. No cell toxicity was observed by LDH assay. Similar results were found with long fibers as well (data not shown). These results suggest that MAP kinases might be required for TNF-α production by macrophages in response to glass fibers. Three MAP kinases, p38, ERK, and JNK, were analyzed in this study. Activation of these three kinases is associated with phosphorylation status of serine or threonine residues. Phospho-specific kinase antibodies were employed to detect phosphorylated p38, ERK, or JNK using Western blot analysis. The rat alveolar macrophages were exposed to glass fiber for 2 h, and the whole cell lysate was used for the phosphorylation assay. The protein-containing membrane was blotted with phospho-specific p38 antibody, which can specifically recognize the dual phosphorylated threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 in the p38 MAP kinase protein. As shown in Fig. 2 A, exposure of rat alveolar macrophages to glass fibers resulted in phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase. After being stripped, the membrane was reblotted with a regular a p38 antibody, which revealed the total p38. The phosphorylation signal was normalized for total p38 protein. The result shows that glass fibers activated p38 MAP kinase and that long fibers expressed a stronger activity than short fibers. Phosphorylation of p38 was induced 7-fold by long and 3.5-fold by short glass fibers compared with the untreated group (Fig. 2 B). ERK and JNK MAP kinases were analyzed in a similar manner. The results indicate that ERK was also activated by glass fibers (Fig.2 C). Phosphorylation of ERK was induced 14-fold by long and 7-fold by short glass fibers (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, JNK activity was not activated by glass fibers (Fig. 2, E andF). These results suggest that p38 and ERK may be major components in the signal transduction pathway for TNF-α induction by glass fibers. The above results indicate that p38 and ERK may be involved in induction of TNF-α production by glass fibers. Because TNF-α expression is controlled at the transcriptional level, the role of p38 or ERK in activation of the gene promoter by glass fibers was examined. The promoter activity of the TNF-α gene was studied by transient transfection of rat alveolar macrophage cells (NR8383). A luciferase reporter vector that is controlled by a wild type TNF-α gene promoter was used for this purpose. Macrophages were transfected by the plasmid vector and then exposed to glass fiber samples. The reporter assay indicates that the TNF-α gene promoter was activated by both short and long glass fibers (Fig.3 A). However, long fibers were nearly three times as potent as short fibers. Long fibers induced a 20-fold increase, whereas short fibers induced a 7-fold increase in the promoter activity. The role of p38 or ERK in activation of the TNF-α promoter was examined by using specific p38 or MEK inhibitors. SB203580 and PD98059 were added to the cell culture at a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%. Me2SO was used as a control. Pretreatment of the transfected cells with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or an MEK inhibitor (PD98059) significantly reduced the TNF-α gene promoter response to long glass fibers (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were found with short fibers as well (data not shown). Each of the inhibitors resulted in approximately a 70% loss of the promoter activity induced by long fibers. These data provide evidence that p38 and ERK MAP kinases may mediate transcriptional activation of the TNF-α gene in alveolar macrophages in response to glass fibers. p38 and ERK MAP kinases regulate target gene transcription through activation of nuclear proteins such as c-Fos, c-Jun, and ATF-2 (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins c-Fos and c-Jun are two subunits of the transcription factor AP-1. In addition to interaction with the AP-1 site, c-Jun is able to activate a CRE element by forming homodimer or heterodimer with ATF-2. Because both AP-1 and CRE elements are enhancers in the TNF-α gene promoter, it is quite possible that p38 and ERK MAP kinases induced the TNF-α gene promoter through AP-1 and CRE elements. The protein binding activities of AP-1 and CRE elements were investigated in nuclear extracts of alveolar macrophages using an EMSA. The results show that DNA binding activity of AP-1 was significantly induced by glass fibers and that long fibers exhibited a stronger activity than short fibers (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1"
https://openalex.org/W2047539110,"We have previously shown that the first 147 N-terminal residues of the rat liver carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), encompassing its two transmembrane (TM) segments, specify both mitochondrial targeting and anchorage at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). In the present study, we have identified the precise import sequence in this polytopic OMM protein. In vitro import studies with fusion and deletion CPT1 proteins demonstrated that none of its TM segments behave as a signal anchor sequence. Analysis of the regions flanking the TM segments revealed that residues 123–147, located immediately downstream of TM2, function as a noncleavable, matrix-targeting signal. They specify mitochondrial targeting, whereas the hydrophobic TM segment(s) acts as a stop-transfer sequence that stops and anchors the translocating CPT1 into the OMM. Heterologous expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of several deleted CPT1 proteins not only confirms the validity of the “stop-transfer” import model but also indicates that residues 1–82 of CPT1 contain a putative microsomal targeting signal whose cellular significance awaits further investigation. Finally, we identified a highly folded core within the C-terminal domain of CPT1 that is hidden in the entire protein by its cytosolic N-terminal residues. Functional analysis of the deleted CPT1 proteins indicates that this folded C-terminal core, which may belong to the catalytic domain of CPT1, requires TM2 for its correct folding achievement and is in close proximity to residues 1–47.

Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of long chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitines, which permits, in cooperation with the carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase and the CPT2, their transport from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix to undergo β-oxidation. CPT1 is tightly regulated by its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, the first committed intermediate of fatty acid biosynthesis (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The liver mitochondrial CPT1 isoform is anchored into the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) in an Ncyto-Ccytoorientation via two α-helical hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments (TM1, residues 48–75; TM2, residues 103–122). Its N terminus (residues 1–47) and its large C-terminal domain (residues 123–773) are facing the cytosol, whereas the loop connecting TM1 and TM2 is exposed in the intermembrane space (2Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Apart from mitochondria, microsomes and peroxisomes also contain membrane-bound malonyl-CoA-sensitive CPTs (4Derrick J. Ramsay R. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 5Broadway N.M. Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 989-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which share similar functional properties with the mitochondrial CPT1, have an identical molecular mass of about 88 kDa, and were immunoreactive with antibodies raised against distinct linear epitopes of the mitochondrial CPT1 (6Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whether these enzymes are identical or similar is still a matter of debate. This raises the crucial question of how the mitochondrial CPT1 is specifically imported into the OMM and whether multiple or hierarchical targeting sequences could exist within a single polypeptide allowing distinct subcellular locations. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and harbor signals that mediate primarily, via a specific interaction with the outer mitochondrial receptors (Tom complex), their mitochondrial targeting and specify their intramitochondrial sorting (7Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). The targeting signals in matrix-destined preproteins are cleavable N-terminal presequences, positively charged and that have the potential to adopt amphipathic α-helices (8Roise D. Horvath S.J. Tomich J.M. Richards J.H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). By contrast, integral OMM proteins are synthesized as noncleavable proteins (9Shore G.C. McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Steenaart N.A.E. Nguyen M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and therefore are targeted to mitochondria by means of internal signals. How this is accomplished is still not clear, although clues have begun to emerge from studies of bitopic proteins, such as the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tom70 and Tom6 and the mammalian Bcl-2 protein. Their targeting and insertion into the OMM have been shown to be mediated by their unique hydrophobic TM segment that functions as a “signal anchor sequence” selective for the OMM (10McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol.

An alternative to the signal anchor sequence model is the combination of a matrix-targeting signal with a hydrophobic stop-transfer sequence. Primarily based on the import studies of artificial bitopic chimeric proteins (13Steenaart N.A.E. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12057-12061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this model has been shown to be valid for theNeurospora crassa bitopic Tom22 protein (14Rodriguez-Cousino N. Nargang F.E. Baardman R. Neupert W. Lill R. Court D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 373: 11527-11532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Very few investigations have been performed on the nature of the targeting and/or topogenic signals of integral polytopic OMM proteins over the past 15 years. These proteins fall into two classes, namely those that contain transmembrane β-sheets, such as porin and the yeast Tom40, and those with α-helical hydrophobic TM segments. In the case of porin and Tom40, limited information regarding structural determinants of these β-barrel proteins is available (15Hamajima S. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Ono S. Sato R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Smith M.D. Petrak M. Boucher P.D. Barton K.N. Carter L. Reddy G. Blachly Dyson E. Forte M. Price J. Verner K. McCauley R.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but the precise nature of their targeting signals remains unclear. Bearing in mind the structural difference between the two classes of polytopic OMM proteins, it would appear unlikely that the targeting and/or topogenic signals operate in a uniform manner. Thus, the rat liver CPT1 could be a useful model to study the mechanisms involved in mitochondrial targeting and membrane insertion of OMM proteins containing more than one α-helical hydrophobic TM segment. We have previously shown that the N-terminal domain (residues 1–147) of CPT1 contains all of the information for mitochondrial targeting, OMM insertion, and membrane orientation (20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the precise internal import signal of CPT1 by using two complementary approaches. In vitro import assay of fusion and/or deletion CPT1 proteins shows that its import into the OMM does not occur by a “signal anchor” but by a “stop-transfer” mechanism with the involvement of an internal matrix-targeting signal located immediately downstream of TM2. Heterologous expression inS. cerevisiae of several deleted CPT1 proteins not only confirms the validity of this model but also allows new insights into the folding of the C-terminal catalytic domain of CPT1. The functional importance of certain residues within the N-terminal domain for maintenance of a putative catalytic core is discussed. Escherichia coli DH5α strain was used to propagate various plasmids and their derivatives. The transcription plasmid pGEM4 (Promega) was used for cloning DNA fragments, making constructs, andin vitro transcription/translation. All of the pGEM4 constructs were under the control of the SP6 promoter. All DNA manipulations (restriction and ligation) were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers' protocols for the respective enzymes. The same strategy was used to generate all dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion constructs in which different parts of the N-terminal end of CPT1 were fused to DHFR. cDNAs coding for these regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using different primers and pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ (21Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as template. All 5′-primers introduce an Eco RI restriction site (in front of a start codon), whereas the 3′-primers contain a Bam HI restriction site, except for pCPT1-(33–47)-DHFR. DNA fragments encoding CPT1-(1–32), CPT1-(1–47), and CPT1-(1–82) were amplified by PCR using the same 5′-primer as previously described for pCPT1-(1–147)-DHFR (20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the respective 3′-primers as follows: 5′-GC GGA TCC GCA GAT CTG TTT GAG-3′, 5′-CG GGA TCC CTT GAA CCG GAT GAA-3′, and 5′-CG GGA TCC GCC CAG GGA GGG-3′. TheEco RI-Bam HI PCR products were subcloned into pGEM4-DHFR (20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to generate pCPT1-(1–32)-DHFR, pCPT1-(1–47)-DHFR, and pCPT1-(1–82)-DHFR. DNA fragments encoding CPT1-(97–122) and CPT1-(97–147) were amplified using the same 5′-primer 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG TCA AGC CAG ACG-3′ and the following 3′-primers: 5′-GC GGA TTC CAT GGT CAT GAT GAC-3′ for CPT1-(97–122) and 5′-GC GGA TCC GGT GCT GCG GCT CAT-3′ for CPT1-(97–147). PCR products were then ligated into pGEM4-DHFR to obtain pCPT1-(97–122)-DHFR and pCPT1-(97–147)-DHFR. The latter 3′-primer was also used with the 5′-primer 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG CGC TAC TCG CTG-3′ to amplify the DNA coding for CPT1-(122–147). The PCR product inserted into pGEM4-DHFR creates pCPT1-(122–147)-DHFR. DNA fragments encoding CPT1-(48–75) and CPT1-(48–122) were amplified using the same 5′-primer 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG AAT GGC ATC ATC ACT-3′ and the respective 3′-primers: 5′-GC GGA TCC GGC ATG CAT GGA TGA-3′ and 5′-GC GGA TCC CTT CGT CTG GCT TGA-3′. DNA encoding CPT1-(76–102) was amplified using 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG AAA GTG GAC CCC TCC-3′ as 5′-primer and 5′-GC GGA TCC CTT CGT CTG GCT TGA-3′ as 3′-primer. The PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM4-DHFR to give pCPT1-(48–75)-DHFR, pCPT1-(48–122)-DHFR, and pCPT1-(76–102)-DHFR, respectively. The DNA fragment encoding CPT1-(33–47) was amplified using pCPT1-(1–47)-DHFR as template, the 5′-primer 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG CTG TCG GGG CTG CAC-3′, and the 3′-primer 5′-TCC AAA CTT TTG GCA AGA AAA-3′ (including the unique Sac I restriction site of DHFR cDNA). The amplified Eco RI-Sac I fragment was then ligated into pCPT1-(1–47)-DHFR digested by Eco RI andSac I to obtain pCPT1-(33–47)-DHFR. All of these DHFR fusion constructs contain four extra amino acids (Gly, Ser, Gly, and Ile) in the joining region. DNA encoding the OM segment (amino acids 11–29) of S. cerevisiae Tom70 was amplified by PCR using the pOMD29 plasmid (10McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as template and the following primers: the 5′-primer 5′-CG GGA TCC GCC ATT TTG GCT GCA-3′ (introducing a Bam HI restriction site) and the 3′-primer 5′-AAA ATG AGC TCC TCG TGG TGG TTC TTT-3′ (including the Sac I restriction site of DHFR in pOMD29). The PCR product was digested by Bam HI and Sac I and ligated into either pCPT1-(1–47)-DHFR or pCPT1-(122–147)-DHFR cut by the same enzymes to generate pCPT1-(1–47)-OM-DHFR and pCPT1-(122–147)-OM-DHFR. Deletion of the first 82 amino acids of CPT1, CPT1Δ82, was achieved by amplifying the DNA coding for CPT1-(83–186) by PCR using the 5′-primer 5′-CG GAA TTC ATG ATC GCA AAG ATC AGT-3′ (introducing an Eco RI restriction site) and the 3′-primer 5′-ATT CCA GGT ACC TGC TCA CAG-3′ (containing the uniqueKpn I restriction site of CPT1). The PCR product digested byEco RI and Kpn I was ligated into pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ cut by the same enzymes to generate pCPT1Δ82. DNA encoding CPT1-(1–82) was amplified by PCR using the same 5′-primer previously used to generate pCPT1-(1–147)-DHFR and the 3′-primer 5′-CGG GAT CCT GCC CAG GGA GGG-3′, introducing a Bam HI restriction site. TheEco RI-Bam HI PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ deleted from its largeEco RI-Bgl II fragment which codes for the first 147 amino acids of CPT1. The resulting pCPT1Δ83–148 encodes a protein in which amino acid 82 is fused to residue 149 and possesses one extra amino acid (Arg) in the joining region. This construct was obtained by excising theBgl II-Bgl II fragment from pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ and re-ligating the plasmid. This results in a CPT1 protein in which amino acid 30 is fused to amino acid 149. DNA encoding CPT1-(122–147) was amplified by PCR using pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ as template and the same 5′-primer as previously used for pCPT1-(122–147)-DHFR and the 3′-primer 5′-AGC CAT CCA GAT CTT GGT GCT GCG-3′ containing a Bgl II restriction site. This Eco RI-Bgl II PCR product was ligated into pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ digested by Eco RI and Bgl II. The resulting construct pCPT1Δ121 encodes a CPT1 protein deleted of its 121 N-terminal amino acids. This plasmid encodes a CPT1 protein deleted of residues 123–148. DNA encoding CPT1-(1–122) was amplified by PCR using the same 5′-primer used for pCPT1-(1–147)-DHFR and the 3′-primer 5′-GCG GAT CCG CAT GGT CAT GAT GAC-3′ introducing aBam HI restriction site. This PCR product was cloned as anEco RI-Bam HI fragment into pGEM4-CPT1Δ3′ digested with Eco RI and Bgl II to obtain pCPT1Δ123–148. One amino acid (Arg) was introduced between residues 122 and 149. cDNAs encoding the deleted CPT1 proteins were retrieved from pGEM4 as an Eco RI-Sal I insert and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pYeDP1/8–10 containing the full-length CPT1 (pYeDP-CPT1) (21Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J.

Each cDNA was placed under the control of the inducible GAL10 promoter present in the vector. The fidelity of all PCRs and the quality of DNA subcloning were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation using the TNT® SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Isolation of purified rat liver mitochondria was performed as described previously (20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol.

In vitro import of radiolabeled proteins into mitochondria was carried out for 30 min at 4 or 30 °C in import buffer as in Ref. 20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol.

Dissipation of the membrane potential (ΔΨ) by 1 μm of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma), mitochondrial pretreatment with trypsin (Sigma), postmitochondrial treatment with trypsin, alkaline extraction with 0.1 mNa2CO3, as well as analysis of the import reactions by SDS-PAGE and fluorography were performed as described previously (20Cohen I.

After import, samples were split into 5 eq aliquots (70 μg of mitochondrial protein). Mitochondria were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, washed in KCl buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 80 mm KCl, pH 7.6), and resuspended (0.5 mg of protein/ml). Mitochondria were then diluted 10-fold either in KCl buffer (nonswollen mitochondria) or in a swelling buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) and subjected to trypsin (100 μg/ml) when indicated. After a 20-min incubation on ice, 2.8 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI; Sigma) was added, and samples were further kept on ice for 10 min. Mitochondria/mitoplasts were reisolated by centrifugation and washed in EDTA buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6). Mitoplasts were then solubilized by 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) in the absence or presence of trypsin (400 μg/ml). After centrifugation, both the pellet and the supernatant were incubated 5 min at 65 °C to inhibit trypsin, and the solubilized proteins present in the supernatant were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by fluorography. The efficiency of swelling and solubilization of the mitoplasts was assessed by immunostaining. The yeast expression vector pYeDP1-8/10 containing the various deleted CPT1 proteins was used to transform S. cerevisiae(haploid strain W303: MATa, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3, ade2-1, can1-100) according to Ref. 22Klebe R.J.

The antisera used were against the rat liver CPT1 (1/3000–1/10,000), the yeast cytochrome b 2 (1/1000), and the yeast mtHSP70 (1/10,000). CPT activity was assayed at 30 °C as palmitoyl-l-[methyl-3H]carnitine formed from l-[methyl-3H]carnitine (200 μm; 10 Ci/mol) and palmitoyl-CoA (80 μm) in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) as described previously (21Prip-Buus C.

When indicated, mitochondria were solubilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 as described in Ref. 20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol.

Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. To investigate the precise location of the mitochondrial targeting signal of CPT1 within its N-terminal domain, we first asked whether each half of this domain could play an equivalent role in this process. For this purpose, CPT1-(1–82) and CPT1-(97–147) were fused to a non-OMM-related protein, the cytosolic mouse DHFR (Fig.1 A). CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR was used as a positive control protein, since CPT1-(1–147) allowed import of DHFR into the OMM in a temperature- and trypsin-sensitive surface receptor-dependent manner, the latter being exposed on the cytosolic face of mitochondria (20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR, CPT1-(1–82), and CPT1-(97–147) were synthesized in vitro and used to perform import reactions to determine their specific import requirements. In all cases, efficiency of import into the OMM was assayed using the alkaline extraction method, which removes all proteins that are not integrated into the membranes (10McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.-M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A significant amount of alkaline-resistant CPT1-(1–82)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR was recovered at 30 °C when mitochondria were added in the import reaction (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 2 and 5), suggesting that TM1 and TM2 of CPT1 allowed membrane insertion of CPT1-(1–82)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR, respectively. Like CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR, the inserted CPT1-(1–82)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR were totally digested by exogenous added trypsin (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 5 and6), confirming their insertion into the OMM with DHFR exposed to the cytosol. However, the efficiency of OMM insertion of CPT1-(1–82)-DHFR was decreased by 75% in comparison to what was observed for CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR. Moreover, analysis of their import requirements showed that, like CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR but unlike CPT1-(1–82)-DHFR, CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR was imported into the OMM in a temperature- (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 4 and 5) and trypsin-sensitive receptor- (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 5 and7) dependent manner. Thus, the second half of the N-terminal domain of CPT1 conferred to DHFR the ability to interact with the mitochondrial receptors and to be specifically inserted into the OMM. Similarly, deletion of residues 83–148 in CPT1 abrogatedin vitro the ability of the protein to be imported into rat liver mitochondria in a temperature- and trypsin-sensitive receptor-dependent manner, whereas deletion of residues 1–82 did not (data not shown). These results suggest that the signal sequence of CPT1 mediating mitochondrial targeting may reside within residues 97–147. To determine whether one or both of the TM segments of CPT1 function as a mitochondrial signal anchor sequence, we fused CPT1-(48–75), CPT1-(97–122), and CPT1-(48–122) to DHFR (Fig.2 A). When import reactions were performed in the absence of added mitochondria, a small amount of CPT1-(48–75)-DHFR, CPT1-(97–122)-DHFR, and CPT1-(48–122)-DHFR was recovered as alkaline-resistant forms (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), likely due to protein aggregation. Import in the presence of mitochondria led to an increase in the level of these alkaline-resistant forms (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2 and 4) that were totally digested by trypsin (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the presence of TM1 and/or TM2 allowed insertion of DHFR into the OMM, the latter facing the cytosol. However, in contrast to CPT1-(1–147)-DHFR and CPT1-(97–147)-DHFR (Fig. 1 B), there was no significant changes in the amount of inserted CPT1-(48–75)-DHFR, CPT1-(97–122)-DHFR, and CPT1-(48–122)-DHFR when import was performed with trypsin-pretreated organelles (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 4 and 6). These results show that insertion of TM1 and/or TM2 into the OMM does not require the trypsin-sensitive surface receptors in contrast to CPT1. Thus, targeting of CPT1 to mitochondria is not mediated by its TM segments, ruling out the hypothesis that they may serve as signal anchor sequences. Therefore, the mitochondrial targeting signal of CPT1 must reside in regions flanking the TM segments. Hydrophobic cluster analysis is an efficient method for predicting secondary protein structure and segmentation (25Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This method predicts two putative amphiphilic β-strands within residues 1–32 (β1, residues 8–14; β2, residues 19–23) and three amphipathic α-helices (residues 33–47, 76–102, and 123–147) flanking the TM segments (26Cohen I. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 466: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether these regions have the capacity to target a reporter protein to mitochondria, we constructed a series of proteins in which CPT1-(1–47), CPT1-(1–32), CPT1-(33–47), CPT1-(76–102), and CPT1-(122–147) were fused to DHFR (Fig. 3 A). We used the Su9-DHFR protein, which consists of the presequence ofN. crassa F0-ATPase subunit 9 preceding DHFR (27Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), as a positive control for protein import into the mitochondrial matrix. In all cases, the efficiency of the import of these radiolabeled fusion proteins into mitochondria was estimated by determining their protection toward trypsin proteolysis. Su9-DHFR was imported into the mitochondrial matrix, where it became processed to its mature-form size, which was inaccessible to exogenously added trypsin (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 4 and8). Following import at 30 °C in the presence of mitochondria, CPT1-(1–47)-DHFR, CPT1-(1–32)-DHFR, and CPT1-(76–102)-DHFR were recovered in association with mitochondria but were almost totally digested by exogenous trypsin (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 4 and 8). This indicated that these CPT1 residues were unable to drive DHFR into the mitochondria. By contrast, CPT1-(33–47)-DHFR and CPT1-(122–147)-DHFR became largely insensitive to added trypsin (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 4 and 8), demonstrating that they were at least translocated across the OMM. Acquisition of the protease protection occurred in a temperature- and receptor-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B, compare lane 3–5) and needed the presence of a membrane potential (ΔΨ) (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 3 and 4). To ascertain the location of CPT1-(33–47)-DHFR and CPT1-(122–147)-DHFR to the matrix, mitochondria were subfractionated by a swelling procedure in the presence of trypsin. As expected from previous studies (21Prip-Buus C. Cohen I. Kohl C. Esser V. McGarry J.D. Girard J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the endogenous CPT1 protein was resistant to trypsin digestion in intact mitochondria (due to a folded state of its large cytosolic C-terminal domain) (Fig.3 D, lane 3) and was partially degraded into an 83-kDa fragment when the OMM was disrupted upon swelling (Fig.3 D, f1 fragment). In contrast, the imported CPT1-(33–47)-DHFR and CPT1-(122–147)-DHFR remained resistant to trypsin proteolysis, as was the endogenous matrix-soluble HSP70 protein (mtHSP70). When the inner membrane of mitoplasts was further solubilized by Triton X-100, the imported CPT1-(33–47)-DHFR and CPT1-(122–147)-DHFR were totally degraded by trypsin, whereas a proteolytic fragment was generated for mtHSP70 (Fig."

Investigating the role these mediators play in human skin, we found that both NIK and TRAF2 failed to evoke transcription from NF-κB-dependent promoters linked to the CAT reporter in human dermal fibroblast cultures, while epidermal keratinocyte cultures demonstrated NIK-dependent signaling. Further, NF-κB activation by TNF-α was unaffected by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant NIK in fibroblasts, despite detection of endogenous TRAF2 and NIK by Western analysis. To explore alternative signaling mechanisms in dermal fibroblasts, we found that the intracellular calcium chelator, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid, and the calpain inhibitor,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, both blocked NF-κB activation; however, the specific proteosome inhibitor, lactacystin, failed to do so. Furthermore, TNF-α receptor mutants lacking a functional death domain failed to stimulate NF-κB, while phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C inhibition and alkalization of endolysosomal compartments blocked its activation by TNF-α. These data indicate that, while epidermal keratinocytes utilize previously defined, NIK-dependent NF-κB pathways, dermal fibroblasts demonstrate unique NIK/TRAF2-independent signal transduction, where both acidic sphingomyelinase and calpain activity act as surrogate mediators for NF-κB activation.

Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Prior to its activation, the 26-kDa TNF-α propeptide is proteolytically converted to its active 17-kDa form. After subsequent trimerization, TNF-α binds and activates two distinct membrane-bound receptors, thereby initiating a diverse intracellular signal transduction cascade (2Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The 55-kDa type I receptor (TNFR1) and 75-kDa type II receptor (TNFR2) are found at the surface of most human cell types. Although the TNFR2 has a significantly higher ligand affinity and dissociation rate, most biological effects are transduced through TNFR1 (3Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Signaling via TNFR2 is largely redundant to TNFR1, since both receptors are able to activate NF-κB. However, TNFR2 is unable to initiate apoptosis or generate the second messenger ceramide (4Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Both receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and must oligomerize to initiate intracellular signaling. Two partially overlapping pathways mediate TNFR1 signaling: activation of sphingomyelinases and aggregation of the TNF receptor-associated molecules (5Heller R.A. Krönke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar).Within the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1 lies the death domain (6Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). This region is responsible for clustering the TNF-α receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and the receptor-interacting protein, as well as indirectly binding TRAF2 (7Hsu H.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Bridging the gap between TRAF2 and IκB is the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a MEKKK family member that phosphorylates and thereby activates the IκB kinase (IKK) in response to both TNF-α and interleukin-1 (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). IKK completes the pathway by phosphorylating IκB at two key serine residues prior to its subsequent degradation (12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).The TNFR1 death domain, through its association with TRADD and FADD, activates acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) (13Schwandner R.

A more upstream segment of the TNFR1 intracellular domain binds FAN, a coupling protein linked to neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) (14Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol.

N-SMase acts at the plasma membrane, while A-SMase is presumed to act at endolysosomal compartments, and both result in ceramide generation (17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). These aliphatic cleavage products act as potent second messengers, activating NF-κB through an unknown mechanism.In most cell types, NF-κB is an inducible transcriptional modulator, activated by a myriad of factors including cellular stress, viral infection, inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and UV irradiation (12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Prior to activation, homo- and heterodimeric Rel family members are held latent in the cytoplasm by IκB (19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In response to appropriate stimulation, a series of phosphorylation events occurs, terminating on IκB and leading to its eventual degradation. In addition to polyubiquitinization (Ubn) with concomitant degradation in the 26 S proteosome (20Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 21Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar), other mechanisms for IκB proteolysis have been recently described that rely on calcium-dependent, calpain-mediated IκB degradation (22Han Y.

Virol. 1998; 72: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The discrete steps linking the various upstream TNF-α signal transduction cascades with the multiple IκB degradation mechanisms are not completely understood. Herein we have explored the function of NIK in regulating NF-κB activation within human skin. As has been described in other cell types, NF-κB activity in keratinocytes is an NIK-dependent phenomenon. In fibroblasts however, we provide evidence for an essential, yet NIK-independent, role of sphingomyelinase action and calpain proteolysis in governing the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α.DISCUSSIONOver the past decade, tremendous progress has been made regarding the various signal transduction mechanisms mediating the numerous effects of TNF-α. Through two hybrid screening techniques, the family of TNFR-associated proteins was discovered. Separately, sphingomyelinases were found to play a role in TNF-α/NF-κB signal transduction. With the discovery of the NIK/IKK/IκB/proteosome pathway (37Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3180-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In this study, we have found striking differences in the mechanisms involved in the regulation of NF-κB activation between dermal fibroblasts and previously published reports in other cell lines. Prior studies of the TNFR-associated proteins have predominantly involved the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293. In this cell type, TRADD was found to link the death domain of the TNFR1 to TRAF2 (8Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 491-504Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 9Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). NIK further coupled TRAF2 to IKK, completing a TRADD/TRAF2/NIK/IKK pathway directly to NF-κB activation (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although we were able to duplicate the ligand-independent effects of TRAF2 and NIK in 293 cells, normal human dermal fibroblasts in culture demonstrated distinct variations in their NF-κB signaling mechanism. 293 cells were originally chosen for their lack of TNFR1 gene expression. Although appropriate for the study of the directly receptor-associated factors, TRADD, FADD, and receptor-interacting protein, this particular feature of 293 cells is not essential for the study of NIK. This is demonstrated in our experiments showing that NIK overexpression in keratinocyte cultures induced NF-κB in a fashion identical to that in 293 cells (Fig. 1, A and E).TRAF2 knockout experiments have demonstrated that TRAF2 is not a stringent requirement for NF-κB activation (42Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that TRAF2 is not required for NF-κB activation in both human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, despite its presence in these cells. In keratinocytes, NIK acts independently of TRAF2 (Fig. 1,A and B), implying that other associations coupling NIK to the TNFR1 may exist, a likely scenario since NIK can interact with TRAF1, -2, -3, -5, and -6, despite the fact that TRAF1 and -3 are unable to stimulate NF-κB (2Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, in fibroblasts, neither TRAF2 nor NIK is functional in the NF-κB activation pathway. It is possible that NIK itself may be regulated by an as yet unknown cell-specific inhibitor, resulting in a block of upstream signals emanating from TNF receptor-associated molecules. This idea is supported by recent evidence demonstrating autoregulation of NIK by its own N-terminal negative regulatory domain, which, when overexpressed, blocks the interaction between NIK and the IκB-kinase (43Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), inhibiting NF-κB activation. These data raise the question of the ultimate necessity of NIK in NF-κB signaling. This has recently been partially addressed in mice with the discovery of a naturally occurring NIK mutation that leads to the immunodeficiency, alymphoplasia, which affects B-cell development in otherwise viable mice and results in absent lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (44Yamada T. Mitani T. Yorita K. Uchida D. Matsushima A. Iwamasa K. Fujita S. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).The intracellular domain of TNFR1 required for activation of A-SMase has been mapped to the death domain where TRADD, FADD, and receptor-interacting protein also interact. Both TRADD and FADD have been linked with A-SMase activation (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that overexpression of TRADD and FADD failed to induce A-SMase activity over base line but rather could enhance TNF-α-induced A-SMase activation. Further, dominant negative FADD mutants decreased TNF-α-induced A-SMase activity, suggesting that TRADD and FADD can augment, but are not necessarily required for, A-SMase activation by TNF-α. Caspase-like protease(s) were postulated mediators of this TRADD/FADD-associated A-SMase activation (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that although TRADD, TRAF2, and NIK were unable to initiate NF-κB activation, an intact death domain was required for TNFR1 activation of NF-κB in fibroblasts. Furthermore, alkalization of endolysosomal compartments and inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C, two approaches previously shown to block A-SMase-induced NF-κB activation (17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) were effective in abrogating TNF-α-induced NF-κB in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that TRADD-independent A-SMase activation occurs in fibroblasts and is at least partially responsible for NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α.The emergence of proteosome-independent IκB signaling as demonstrated in WEHI231 immature B cells (23Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human HepG2 cells, as well as NF-κB activation in ubiquitin-defective ts20b cells (22Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) has enlarged the scope of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling. Additionally, previously conflicting reports of calcium dependence or independence (35Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 45Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar) in TNF-α/NF-κB signaling are now resolved with the discovery of parallel IκB degradation pathways, since a calcium/calpain-dependent system coexists with the earlier described, proteosome-mediated pathway (21Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of ceramides to permeablized cells has been shown to stimulate intracellular calpain activity (46Xie H.-Q. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results bolster these findings, since dermal fibroblasts were found to be dependent on intracellular free calcium for NF-κB activation by TNF-α in addition to being blocked by various inhibitors of ceramide activation and loss of the A-SMase-associated death domain region of the TNFR1.In conclusion, we have shown that both NIK/TRAF2-independent and TRADD/A-SMase divergent signaling occur in dermal fibroblasts, while epidermal keratinocyte signaling follows previously reported mechanisms. To our knowledge, these findings in dermal fibroblasts represent the first such account of divergent signal transduction pathways initiated by TNF-α and help to explain differences in NF-κB signaling between cell lines previously reported. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)1 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine elaborated predominantly by migratory immune cells and implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of clinical conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, HIV reactivation, graftversus host disease, and shock (1Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1994; 45: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Prior to its activation, the 26-kDa TNF-α propeptide is proteolytically converted to its active 17-kDa form. After subsequent trimerization, TNF-α binds and activates two distinct membrane-bound receptors, thereby initiating a diverse intracellular signal transduction cascade (2Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). The 55-kDa type I receptor (TNFR1) and 75-kDa type II receptor (TNFR2) are found at the surface of most human cell types. Although the TNFR2 has a significantly higher ligand affinity and dissociation rate, most biological effects are transduced through TNFR1 (3Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Signaling via TNFR2 is largely redundant to TNFR1, since both receptors are able to activate NF-κB. However, TNFR2 is unable to initiate apoptosis or generate the second messenger ceramide (4Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Both receptors lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and must oligomerize to initiate intracellular signaling. Two partially overlapping pathways mediate TNFR1 signaling: activation of sphingomyelinases and aggregation of the TNF receptor-associated molecules (5Heller R.A. Krönke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Within the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1 lies the death domain (6Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). This region is responsible for clustering the TNF-α receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), the Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and the receptor-interacting protein, as well as indirectly binding TRAF2 (7Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 8Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V.

Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent overexpression of either TRADD or TRAF2 activates NF-κB (8Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 491-504Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 10Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), while TRADD also initiates apoptosis (9Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Bridging the gap between TRAF2 and IκB is the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), a MEKKK family member that phosphorylates and thereby activates the IκB kinase (IKK) in response to both TNF-α and interleukin-1 (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). IKK completes the pathway by phosphorylating IκB at two key serine residues prior to its subsequent degradation (12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The TNFR1 death domain, through its association with TRADD and FADD, activates acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A more upstream segment of the TNFR1 intracellular domain binds FAN, a coupling protein linked to neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) (14Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Acting at either acidic or neutral pH optima, these enzymes cleave sphingomyelin from different cellular compartments. N-SMase acts at the plasma membrane, while A-SMase is presumed to act at endolysosomal compartments, and both result in ceramide generation (17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 18Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). These aliphatic cleavage products act as potent second messengers, activating NF-κB through an unknown mechanism. In most cell types, NF-κB is an inducible transcriptional modulator, activated by a myriad of factors including cellular stress, viral infection, inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and UV irradiation (12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Prior to activation, homo- and heterodimeric Rel family members are held latent in the cytoplasm by IκB (19Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In response to appropriate stimulation, a series of phosphorylation events occurs, terminating on IκB and leading to its eventual degradation. In addition to polyubiquitinization (Ubn) with concomitant degradation in the 26 S proteosome (20Traenckner E.B.-M. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 21Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar), other mechanisms for IκB proteolysis have been recently described that rely on calcium-dependent, calpain-mediated IκB degradation (22Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell.

The discrete steps linking the various upstream TNF-α signal transduction cascades with the multiple IκB degradation mechanisms are not completely understood. Herein we have explored the function of NIK in regulating NF-κB activation within human skin. As has been described in other cell types, NF-κB activity in keratinocytes is an NIK-dependent phenomenon. In fibroblasts however, we provide evidence for an essential, yet NIK-independent, role of sphingomyelinase action and calpain proteolysis in governing the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α. DISCUSSIONOver the past decade, tremendous progress has been made regarding the various signal transduction mechanisms mediating the numerous effects of TNF-α. Through two hybrid screening techniques, the family of TNFR-associated proteins was discovered. Separately, sphingomyelinases were found to play a role in TNF-α/NF-κB signal transduction. With the discovery of the NIK/IKK/IκB/proteosome pathway (37Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

To our knowledge, these findings in dermal fibroblasts represent the first such account of divergent signal transduction pathways initiated by TNF-α and help to explain differences in NF-κB signaling between cell lines previously reported. Over the past decade, tremendous progress has been made regarding the various signal transduction mechanisms mediating the numerous effects of TNF-α. Through two hybrid screening techniques, the family of TNFR-associated proteins was discovered. Separately, sphingomyelinases were found to play a role in TNF-α/NF-κB signal transduction. With the discovery of the NIK/IKK/IκB/proteosome pathway (37Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and the coupling associations between TRADD/A-SMase (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and FAN/N-SMase (15Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway has been extensively explored. However, recent reports have revealed a novel diversity to the NF-κB activation cascades, including coexistent calpain and proteosome IκB proteolysis (22Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), temporally biphasic NF-κB activation that utilizes both calpain and proteosome hydrolysis of IκB (39Han Y. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9825-9832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), calpain-specific IκB degradation discovered in an immature B cell line (23Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lysosomal IκB proteolysis (40Cuervo A.M. Hu W. Lim B. Dice J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1995-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and redox-dependent, proteosome-mediated IκB-α proteolysis that does not require IκB phosphorylation (41Kretz-Remy C. Bates E.E.M. Arrigo A.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3180-3191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found striking differences in the mechanisms involved in the regulation of NF-κB activation between dermal fibroblasts and previously published reports in other cell lines. Prior studies of the TNFR-associated proteins have predominantly involved the human embryonic kidney cell line, 293. In this cell type, TRADD was found to link the death domain of the TNFR1 to TRAF2 (8Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 491-504Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 9Hsu H. Shu H.-B. Pan M.-G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). NIK further coupled TRAF2 to IKK, completing a TRADD/TRAF2/NIK/IKK pathway directly to NF-κB activation (11Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 12Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although we were able to duplicate the ligand-independent effects of TRAF2 and NIK in 293 cells, normal human dermal fibroblasts in culture demonstrated distinct variations in their NF-κB signaling mechanism. 293 cells were originally chosen for their lack of TNFR1 gene expression. Although appropriate for the study of the directly receptor-associated factors, TRADD, FADD, and receptor-interacting protein, this particular feature of 293 cells is not essential for the study of NIK. This is demonstrated in our experiments showing that NIK overexpression in keratinocyte cultures induced NF-κB in a fashion identical to that in 293 cells (Fig. 1, A and E). TRAF2 knockout experiments have demonstrated that TRAF2 is not a stringent requirement for NF-κB activation (42Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was not surprising that TRAF2 is not required for NF-κB activation in both human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes, despite its presence in these cells. In keratinocytes, NIK acts independently of TRAF2 (Fig. 1,A and B), implying that other associations coupling NIK to the TNFR1 may exist, a likely scenario since NIK can interact with TRAF1, -2, -3, -5, and -6, despite the fact that TRAF1 and -3 are unable to stimulate NF-κB (2Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in fibroblasts, neither TRAF2 nor NIK is functional in the NF-κB activation pathway. It is possible that NIK itself may be regulated by an as yet unknown cell-specific inhibitor, resulting in a block of upstream signals emanating from TNF receptor-associated molecules. This idea is supported by recent evidence demonstrating autoregulation of NIK by its own N-terminal negative regulatory domain, which, when overexpressed, blocks the interaction between NIK and the IκB-kinase (43Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), inhibiting NF-κB activation. These data raise the question of the ultimate necessity of NIK in NF-κB signaling. This has recently been partially addressed in mice with the discovery of a naturally occurring NIK mutation that leads to the immunodeficiency, alymphoplasia, which affects B-cell development in otherwise viable mice and results in absent lymph nodes and Peyer's patches (44Yamada T. Mitani T. Yorita K. Uchida D. Matsushima A. Iwamasa K. Fujita S. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of TNFR1 required for activation of A-SMase has been mapped to the death domain where TRADD, FADD, and receptor-interacting protein also interact. Both TRADD and FADD have been linked with A-SMase activation (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that overexpression of TRADD and FADD failed to induce A-SMase activity over base line but rather could enhance TNF-α-induced A-SMase activation. Further, dominant negative FADD mutants decreased TNF-α-induced A-SMase activity, suggesting that TRADD and FADD can augment, but are not necessarily required for, A-SMase activation by TNF-α. Caspase-like protease(s) were postulated mediators of this TRADD/FADD-associated A-SMase activation (13Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that although TRADD, TRAF2, and NIK were unable to initiate NF-κB activation, an intact death domain was required for TNFR1 activation of NF-κB in fibroblasts. Furthermore, alkalization of endolysosomal compartments and inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-phospholipase C, two approaches previously shown to block A-SMase-induced NF-κB activation (17Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) were effective in abrogating TNF-α-induced NF-κB in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that TRADD-independent A-SMase activation occurs in fibroblasts and is at least partially responsible for NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α. The emergence of proteosome-independent IκB signaling as demonstrated in WEHI231 immature B cells (23Miyamoto S. Seufzer B.J. Shumway S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 19-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human HepG2 cells, as well as NF-κB activation in ubiquitin-defective ts20b cells (22Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Brasier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) has enlarged the scope of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling. Additionally, previously conflicting reports of calcium dependence or independence (35Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 45Steffan N.M. Bren G.D. Frantz B. Tocci M.J. O'Neil E.A. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4685-4691PubMed Google Scholar) in TNF-α/NF-κB signaling are now resolved with the discovery of parallel IκB degradation pathways, since a calcium/calpain-dependent system coexists with the earlier described, proteosome-mediated pathway (21Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of ceramides to permeablized cells has been shown to stimulate intracellular calpain activity (46Xie H.-Q. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results bolster these findings, since dermal fibroblasts were found to be dependent on intracellular free calcium for NF-κB activation by TNF-α in addition to being blocked by various inhibitors of ceramide activation and loss of the A-SMase-associated death domain region of the TNFR1. In conclusion, we have shown that both NIK/TRAF2-independent and TRADD/A-SMase divergent signaling occur in dermal fibroblasts, while epidermal keratinocyte signaling follows previously reported mechanisms. To our knowledge, these findings in dermal fibroblasts represent the first such account of divergent signal transduction pathways initiated by TNF-α and help to explain differences in NF-κB signaling between cell lines previously reported.

By using NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that purified Cdc4p is a monomeric protein with two structurally independent domains, each exhibiting a fold reminiscent of the EF-hand class of calcium-binding proteins. Although Cdc4p has one potentially functional calcium-binding site, it does not bind calcium in vitro. Three variants of Cdc4p containing single point mutations responsible for temperature-sensitive arrest of the cell cycle at cytokinesis (Gly-19 to Glu, Gly-82 to Asp, and Gly-107 to Ser) were also characterized by NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy. In each case, the amino acid substitution only leads to small perturbations in the conformation of the protein. Furthermore, thermal unfolding studies indicate that, like wild-type Cdc4p, the three mutant forms are all extremely stable, remaining completely folded at temperatures significantly above those causing failure of cytokinesis in intact cells. Therefore, the altered phenotype must arise directly from a disruption of the function of Cdc4p rather than indirectly through a disruption of its overall structure. Several mutant alleles of Cdc4p also show interallelic complementation in diploid cells. This phenomenon can be explained if Cdcp4 has more than one essential function or, alternatively, if two mutant proteins assemble to form a functional complex. Based on the structure of Cdc4p, possible models for interallelic complementation including interactions with partner proteins and the formation of a myosin complex with Cdc4p fulfilling the role of both an essential and regulatory light chain are proposed.

Prior to this event, a contractile ring containing actin and myosin forms at the medial plane of the cell. The diameter of this ring decreases progressively during cytokinesis, presumably due to contractile forces generated by the myosin motor, and thereby results in the division of one parent cell into two daughter cells (for review see Refs. 1Gould K.L.

Although the contractile ring is a complex structure, it is highly amenable to molecular genetic studies. Well characterized genes encoding some of the main cytoskeletal components essential for cytokinesis include tropomyosin (cdc8) (3Balasubramanian M.K. Helfman D.M. Hemmingsen S.M. Nature. 1992; 360: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), actin (act1) (4Ishiguro J. Kobayashi W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a putative myosin light chain (cdc4) (5McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Kitayama C. Sugimoto A. Yamamoto M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Motegi F. Nakano K. Kitayama C. Yamamoto M. Mabuchi I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The product of the myo2 (orrng5) gene is essential for contractile ring function, whereas that of the myp2 (or myo3,myo22) gene appears required only under certain conditions (9Motegi F. Nakano K. Kitayama C. Yamamoto M. Mabuchi I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both Myo2p and Myp2p are type II myosins and thus are predicted to consist of two heavy chains that dimerize via an extended C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The globular N-terminal domain of each heavy chain is separated from this coiled-coil by a flexible neck region. In conventional myosins, such as those found in muscle, two EF-hand proteins, termed the essential light chain (ELC)1 and regulatory light chain (RLC), associate with the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of each neck region, respectively, at IQ-motifs (IQXXXRGXXXR, where X is any residue) (10Houdusse A. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10644-10647Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11May K.M. Win T.Z. Hyams J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By analogy, we might also expect an ELC and an RLC to bind each heavy chain inSchizosaccharomyces pombe, playing a structural support role for the α-helical neck region of myosin. The cdc4 locus, which was identified in the original screens for cell division control mutants, is required for septum formation and cell separation (12Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Cells with conditionally lethal point mutations become elongated, dumbbell-shaped, multinucleate and fail to divide before dying. A similar phenotype is observed when the cdc4gene is disrupted (5McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It was suggested that Cdc4p is a myosin light chain based on sequence similarities with EF-hand proteins, on localization to the contractile ring, and on association with Myo2p (5McCollum D. Balasubramanian M.K. Pelcher L.E. Hemmingsen S.M. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,13Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although very likely a myosin light chain, the sequence of Cdc4p is sufficiently distinct that it is not possible to confidently predict whether it functions as the structural equivalent of an ELC or RLC. Site-directed mutation of a conserved residue in the IQ motif proximal to the Myo2p N terminus results in loss of association with Cdc4p in immunoprecipitation assays (13Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This indicates that Cdc4p associates with Myo2p at least at the equivalent of an ELC-binding site (14Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1867-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, S. pombe cells expressing only the mutated form of Myo2p were still viable, suggesting that some binding of Cdc4p may occur in vivo (13Naqvi N.I. Eng K. Gould K.L. Balasubramanian M.K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 854-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Cdc4p may also interact with other proteins in the contractile ring, besides Myo2p, such as Myp2p or Rng2p (7Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Motegi F. Nakano K. Kitayama C. Yamamoto M. Mabuchi I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Eng K. Naqvi N.I. Wong K.C.Y. Balasubramanian M.K. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 611-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, a gene that presumably encodes a small EF-hand protein was annotated as a putative RLC by the Sanger Centre Genome Project (accession number CAB54151). This RLC-like protein also localizes to the contractile ring and appears to interact with Myo2p at the second IQ motif, a recognized binding site for RLC in conventional myosins. 2M. K. Balasubramanian, personal communication. Thus, current evidence suggests that Myo2p is a conventional myosin with Cdc4p serving as an ELC and possibly a second related protein as an RLC. However, the report that initially identified the cdc4 locus also described a pair of closely linked cdc −mutants that complemented one another and recombined with low frequency (12Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Nasmyth K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1976; 146: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This interallelic complementation, which cannot be explained if the only role of Cdc4p is to serve as an ELC, might arise if Cdc4p has two independent, essential functions, each selectively disrupted by a single mutation. Indeed, as shown in the accompanying paper (49Desautels M. Den Haese J.P. Slupsky C.M. McIntosh L.P. Hemmingsen S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5932-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Cdc4p interacts with several additional proteins besides Myo2p, including a putative phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase. Alternatively, interallelic complementation can occur if two mutant forms of a protein assemble to form a functional oligomeric complex in a diploid cell. In support of this latter case, an attractive structural model can be developed in which two mutant forms of Cdc4p, serving as both an ELC and RLC, bind to myosin at both IQ motifs and physically interact with one another via their respective wild-type surfaces. A major goal of our research is to understand the structural basis for the essential functions of Cdc4p, with particular emphasis on defining how conditional mutants of Cdc4p fail to complete cell division under restrictive conditions and on explaining the observed interallelic complementation of these mutants. There are currently no structural data available for any of the cytoskeletal proteins involved in the mechanism and regulation of cytokinesis. To this end, we have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the tertiary structure of wild-type Cdc4p and to characterize three temperature-sensitive mutants of this protein. In parallel with the accompanying paper (49Desautels M. Den Haese J.P. Slupsky C.M. McIntosh L.P. Hemmingsen S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5932-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) describing the identification by genetic and immunochemical methods of proteins that interact with Cdc4p, we discuss possible models for the function of this essential component of the S. pombe cytokinesis machinery. Acdc4 cDNA construct in the Escherichia coliexpression vector pRSET B (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) was a gift of Dr. Dan McCollum (Vanderbilt University). Vectors for expression ofcdc4 temperature-sensitive mutants were made by cloning polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding regions ofcdc4−G19E, cdc4−G82D, andcdc4−G107S into pT7-7 (16Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed using a model 370A automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems Inc.). E. coli strains BL21(λDE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and CT19 (avtA::Tn5/trpB83::Tn10/dcm ompT lon 8DE3 ilvE12 tyrB507 aspC13) (17Waugh D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 184-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were transformed with the appropriate expression vector immediately prior to use. Unlabeled, uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled and selectively α-15N-labeled proteins were prepared using media as described previously (18Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). After induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth overnight at 25–30 °C, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 30 ml of Buffer A (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol) per 500 ml of culture. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a Fractogel anion exchange column (Merck), which was developed at 3 ml/min in Buffer A using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 600 mm. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that Cdc4p eluted from the column between 300 and 400 mm NaCl. Protein from these fractions was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (70% saturation) and dissolved in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The protein solution was loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fractions were collected at 1 ml/min. The Cdc4p was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4(70% saturation), dissolved in 25 mmNH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and loaded on a Superdex 75 column equilibrated with 25 mmNH4HCO3 for buffer exchange. The final fractions were pooled, concentrated in Centricon-3 microconcentration device (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and lyophilized in a Speed-Vac. The identity of each protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry. During preparation of the protein, the N-terminal methionine was removed byE. coli proteases. NMR experiments were performed on ∼5 mm wild-type or mutant Cdc4p dissolved in 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mmdithiothreitol, pH 6.5, in either 90% H2O, 10% D2O or 100% D2O. All data were recorded at 30 °C with a Varian Unity 500-MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-field gradient accessory. NMR data were processed using NMR pipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the program PIPP (20Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M.

The diastereotopic methyl groups of valine and leucine were stereospecifically assigned using biosynthetically directed13C labeling (22Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wuthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Both histidine residues in Cdc4p were shown to be partially deprotonated and predominantly in the Nε2H tautomeric form at pH 6.5 using the HMBC experiment (23Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D.

Assignments of the 1HN and15N resonances in uniformly 15N-labeled Cdc4p-G19E, Cdc4p-G82D, and Cdc4p-G107S were obtained using three-dimensional 15N-TOCSY/NOESY-HSQC experiments. To confirm these assignments, HSQC spectra were also recorded on Cdc4p-G107S selectively labeled with 15N-Phe and15N-Leu, and on Cdc4p-G82D selectively labeled with15N-Phe, 15N-Leu, 15N-Val, and15N-Ala. 15N T 1,T 2, and heteronuclear15N{1H}-NOE relaxation data were recorded and analyzed on uniformly 15N-labeled wild-type and mutant proteins, as described (24Farrow N.A.

Hydrogen bonds were included as distance restraints for those amides remaining protonated 60 min after transfer of the protein into D2O buffer. Torsion angle φ restraints were obtained from an analysis of an HNHA experiment (29Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G.

The circular dichroism spectra of ∼10 μm wild-type or mutant Cdc4p in 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, were acquired with a Jasco J-730 CD spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm water-jacketed quartz cell. Thermal denaturation curves were recorded by monitoring the signal at 222 nm as a function temperature, increased at 1 °C/min. The tertiary structure of Cdc4p was determined from 2195 NMR-derived restraints using a simulated annealing protocol (Fig.1 A). 3The coordinates for the ensemble of structures, along with experimental restraints and NMR chemical shifts, have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank and the BioMagResBank. The ensemble of 26 calculated structures exhibit good covalent geometry as indicated by low r.m.s. deviations from idealized values and by low NOE, dihedral angle, and van der Waals energies (TableI). For all 26 structures, 99.3% of the main chain (φ, ψ) angles fall in the core or allowed regions of the Ramachandran map, as determined using PROCHECK-NMR (31Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A.

With the exception of the N and C termini (residues 2–7 and 138–141, respectively) and a central linker region (residues 65–78), the structures of the backbone and core side chain atoms of Cdc4p are well defined by NMR data.Table IStructural statisticsR.M.S.D. from the average structure (Å2)1-a32 structures were used in the final calculation.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 1 D, Cdc4p adopts a dumbbell-shaped structure with distinct N and C domains. Each consists of four α-helices, named A through D in the N domain (Fig. 1 B) and E through H in the C domain (Fig. 1 C), and a short two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Joining the two domains is a proline-rich linker region (residues 66–77) that is devoid of any regular structure. Based on 15N NMR relaxation measurements (see below), the linker is highly flexible in solution, and thus the N- and C-terminal domains do not have a fixed orientation with respect to one another. Consistent with this conclusion, Cdc4p can be chemically cleaved into two separate domains, and each domain can be expressed in isolation (49Desautels M. Den Haese J.P. Slupsky C.M. McIntosh L.P. Hemmingsen S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5932-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The monomeric nature of Cdc4p is indicated by the narrow resonances detected within its NMR spectra and confirmed by both heteronuclear relaxation measurements, which reveal 15NT 1 and T 2 values consistent with a protein of ∼15 kDa total molecular mass, and by equilibrium ultracentrifugation runs which indicated an average molecular mass of 14.1 ± 0.9 kDa over three iterations at 15,000 rpm (not shown). Consistent with predictions based on sequence alignments, Cdc4p contains four EF-hand structural motifs (32Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3313-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), defined by helices A/B and C/D in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B) and by E/F and G/H in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 C). The two EF-hands within each domain are joined by the antiparallel pairing of the short β-strands located within the loop regions between their constituent helices. The structural similarity between Cdc4p and other EF-hand proteins such as calmodulin prompted us to investigate the possibility of calcium binding by Cdc4p. Accordingly, 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of Cdc4p were recorded both in the presence of excess calcium and of excess EDTA. The NMR spectrum of a protein is extremely sensitive to structural and electrostatic perturbations and thus serves as an excellent indicator of ligand binding. The complete lack of any significant spectral changes under either condition (data not shown) strongly suggests that Cdc4p does not bind calcium with any appreciable affinity. 15N NMR relaxation measurements were carried out to investigate the dynamic properties of the backbone of Cdc4p. As shown in Fig. 2, residues at the N and C termini and within the linker region connecting the two domains of the protein exhibit long transverse (T 2) relaxation times and reduced heteronuclear 15N{1H}-NOE values compared with those in regions of well defined secondary structure. These results are diagnostic of fast internal motions relative to the global tumbling of the protein (33Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy Principles and Practice. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). Therefore, the apparent disorder or high r.m.s. deviations seen for these regions within the ensemble of structures calculated for Cdc4p (Fig.1 A) can be attributed to conformational flexibility on the sub-nanosecond time scale. The dynamic disorder of the termini and linker are further supported by the observation that backbone amides within these regions do not show any significant protection from hydrogen-deuterium exchange with solvent (data not shown). Together, these measurements confirm that the N- and C-domains of Cdc4p are independent structural units tethered by a flexible proline-rich linker sequence. 15N NMR relaxation measurements also indicate the loop regions in Cdc4p are flexible on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Slightly longer transverse (T 2) relaxation times and reduced heteronuclear 15N{1H}-NOE values for amides in the loop regions of the EF-hands I, III, and IV (residues 16–19, 87–90, and 121–126), as well as the loop regions between the EF-hands in the two domains (residues 36–40 and 106–112), indicate more mobility than seen for amides forming elements of regular secondary structure. This corresponds to the slightly higher r.m.s. deviations observed for these loop residues in the ensemble of calculated structure (Fig. 1, B and C). Not surprisingly, the dynamic properties of the backbone of Cdc4p are similar to that observed for other EF-hand proteins, such as apo-cTnC (34Spyracopoulos L. Gagne S.M. Li M.X. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18032-18044Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that, although both domains of Cdc4p are of similar size, the backbone root mean square deviations from the average structure for the C-domain are almost twice that of the N-domain (Table I). This is a direct result of the measurement of fewer dihedral and medium/long range interproton distance restraints in the C-domain versus the N-domain. However, we attribute this to different motional properties of the domains of Cdc4p rather than poorer spectral resolution for residues in the C-domain. This conclusion is based on two related observations. First, peaks corresponding to several residues in the C-domain in the1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of Cdc4p exhibit weak intensity (Gly-82, Gln-84, Val-85, Phe-86, Met-93, Ile-94, Gly-95, Asn-112, Asp-125, Val-129, Tyr-131, and His-132), suggestive of a conformational exchange phenomenon occurring on a sub-millisecond time scale. Second, based on 15N NMR relaxation measurements, the average 15N T 1 andT 2 values for the N-domain (residues 8–64) are 557 ± 27 and 87.8 ± 7.3 ms, respectively, whereas those for the C-domain (residues 79–137) are 566 ± 26 and 75.6 ± 16.5 ms, respectively (Fig. 2). In particular, the shorterT 2 values, along with a greater deviation from the average, for amides in the C-domain of Cdc4p also suggest that the backbone of this portion of the protein may undergo slow motions that could lead to line broadening. In addition, the average heteronuclear15N{1H}-NOE values for the N- and C-domains are 0.67 ± 0.06 and 0.58 ± 0.09, respectively. The slightly lower NOE values for amides in the C-domain suggest that the residues may also be under rapid internal motions on a sub-nanosecond time scale. A similar pattern of complex relaxation behavior was observed in a 15N NMR relaxation study of calmodulin (35Tjandra N. Kuboniwa H. Ren H. Bax A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 1014-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Three conditionally lethal, loss-of-function point mutations in Cdc4p were studied using 1H-15N NMR spectroscopy. The positions of these mutations (G19E, G82D, and G107S) are mapped on the structure of the wild-type protein in Fig.1 D. To investigate the structural and dynamic effects of these amino acid substitutions, three approaches were taken. First,1HN and 15N chemical shift differences between the wild-type and mutant proteins were measured as a sensitive indicator of structural perturbations (Fig.3). Second,3 J HN-Hα coupling constants were measured to investigate possible changes in backbone φ dihedral angles. Finally, 15N relaxation measurements were u"

Taking advantage of the pellicular microtubular structure of the plasma membrane of the organism, we report procedures for obtaining sealed ghost and sealed everted vesicle of defined polarity. Rapid influx of H+into everted vesicles was found to be dependent on the simultaneous presence of ATP (1 mm) and Mg2+ (1 mm). Excellent correspondence between rate of H+ entry and the enzyme activity clearly demonstrated the Mg2+-ATPase to be a true H+ pump. H+ entry into everted vesicle was strongly inhibited by SCH28080 (IC50 = ∼40 μm) and by omeprazole (IC50 = ∼50 μm), both of which are characteristic inhibitors of mammalian gastric H+,K+-ATPase. H+ influx was completely insensitive to ouabain (250 μm), the typical inhibitor of Na+,K+-ATPase. Mg2+-ATPase activity could be partially stimulated with K+ (20 mm) that was inhibitable (>85%) with SCH28080 (50 μm). ATP-dependent rapid efflux of 86Rb+ from preloaded vesicles was completely inhibited by preincubation with omeprazole (150 μm) and by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (1 mm), an inhibitor of the enzyme. Assuming Rb+ to be a true surrogate for K+, an ATP-dependent, electroneutral stoichiometric exchange of H+ and K+ (1:1) was established. Rapid and 10-fold active accumulation of [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose in sealed ghosts could be observed when an artificial pH gradient (interior alkaline) was imposed. Rapid efflux of [U-14C]d-glucose from preloaded everted vesicles could also be initiated by activating the enzyme, with ATP. Taken together, the plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase has been identified as an electroneutral H+/K+ antiporter with some properties reminiscent of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase.

Desjeux P. DeRaadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Leishmania donovani is the established etiological agent for Kala-azar (2Schnur L.F. Greenblatt C.L. Kreier J.P. Parasitic Protozoa. 10. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 1-30Google Scholar). This protozoal pathogen belongs to the kinetoplastida group of parasites. The organism has a digenic life cycle. The flagellated vector or promastigote form normally resides and divides in the alimentary tract of phlebatomine sandflies. Following a bite by the sandfly, the parasite is rapidly internalized in human liver macrophages where it overcomes the host defense mechanism and undergoes a facile morphogenetic transformation to oval, aflagellated amastigote form in the phagolysosomal complex of the macrophages. Rapid proliferation and invasion of neighboring macrophages initiates pathogenesis (3Chang K.-P. Fong D. Bray R.S. Chang K.-P. Bray R.S. Leishmaniasis. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1985: 1-30Google Scholar). The commonly available laboratory cultural form corresponds to the vector or promastigote form of the organism. Ion translocation and energetics of metabolite accumulation across the plasma membrane are important aspects in the physiology of any organism. Although some work has been done in this area for the kinetoplastida group of pathogens, a reasonably clear picture is still not available. L. donovani is known to have a Ca2+-ATPase (4Ghosh J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 18440-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a Mg2+-ATPase (6Dwyer D.M. Gottlieb M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 23: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in its plasma membrane. Catalytic sites of both these transmembrane proteins are oriented toward the cytosol (5Mazumder S. Mukherjee T. Ghosh J. Ray M. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18440-18446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Using sealed, everted vesicles we had earlier unambiguously demonstrated the Ca2+-ATPase to be a true extrusion pump for cytosolic free Ca2+ (8Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Mazumder S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The specific function of the Mg2+-ATPase, however, remains to be elucidated. Using vesicles of undefined and mixed polarity and employing acridine orange as the probe, Zilberstein and Dwyer (7Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) had earlier suggested that the Mg2+-ATPase may be a H+ translocator. More recently, using BCECF-loaded1 L. donovani promastigote cells, Jiang et al. (9Jiang S. Anderson S.A. Winget G.D. Mukkada A.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have indicated the presence of a H+/K+exchanger system in the surface of the parasite that is closely linked to the functioning of this Mg2+-ATPase. The functional capability, if any, of the Mg2+-ATPase to act as an ion translocator needs to be demonstrated clearly and unambiguously. This is also necessary to analyze the related problem of energy coupling in glucose transport across the plasma membrane (10Tetaud E. Barrett M.P. Bringaud F. Baltz T. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Somewhat contradictory results are available in the literature. Based on the effect of ionophores and protonophores on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in whole cells and also of inward flow of H+ across the plasma membrane in de-energized cells on addition of glucose, Zilberstein and Dwyer (11Zilberstein D. Dwyer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1716-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) suggested a glucose/H+ symport mechanism for glucose entry and accumulation. Experiments in chemostat with varying concentrations of glucose, on the other hand, indicate operation of a facilitated diffusion mechanism for glucose entry independent of proton gradient in L. donovani (12terKuile B.H. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A promastigote stage-specific glucose transporter showing significant homology with mammalian facilitative glucose transporter has also been cloned (13Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2130-2134Google Scholar) and functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes (14Langford L.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of 2-deoxyglucose entry process showed it to be a carrier-mediated process, but the requirement for H+ could not be clearly established (14Langford L.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general sealed plasma membrane ghosts or vesicles of defined polarity have been extremely valuable tools for transport studies in many systems. In this paper, using sealed ghosts and vesicles of opposite polarity, we demonstrate that the plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase of Leishmania is indeed an electroneutral H+/K+ antiporter. Further, we observe that imposition of an artificial pH gradient can drive glucose entry and accumulation in the sealed ghost. It is therefore likely that the major physiological roles for this enzyme is in generation of a pH gradient across the plasma membrane that in turn helps in active accumulation of metabolites like glucose. The enzyme is also probably involved in accumulation of K+ inside the cell. The second role is particularly important in view of the uncertain status of Na+,K+-ATPase in this organism, as will be discussed later. All biochemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise mentioned. Bis-oxanol and BCECF were from Molecular Probes.

Omeprazole and SCH28080 were kindly provided by Dr. Pratap Das (IICB), who got these chemicals as gift from Astra Hassle AB and Schering Corporation, respectively. The organism used is a clinical isolate from a confirmed Kala-azar patient, and the strain is designated as MHOM/IN/1978/UR6 (15Chakraborty P. Das P.K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 28: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The UR6 cells were grown and maintained on a solid blood-agar medium as described earlier (16Saha A.K. Mukherjee T. Bhaduri A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 19: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Only the highly motile promastigote cells were used for all experiments. Preparation of sealed ghost and everted vesicles: L. donovani promastigote plasma membrane has a characteristic pellicular microtubular structure that provides strength to the membrane against hypotonic shock. Unsealed ghosts devoid of flagella were first prepared by exposing the promastigotes to controlled hypotonic shock (4Ghosh J. Ray M. Sarkar S. Bhaduri A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11345-11351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Mazumder S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These unsealed aflagellated ghosts were then used for preparation of both sealed ghosts and everted vesicles. The methods are briefly as follows. 2 gm of washed cells, collected at mid-log phase, were suspended in 100 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride that were kept in four long glass tubes at 4 °C. The tubes were mixed by mild vortexing in a cyclomixer 10 times for a total period of 90 min with occasional stirring. The hypotonic shock followed by gentle vortexing resulted in detachment of flagella from the cell body. Formation of unsealed ghosts was confirmed by total leakage of the marker cytoplasmic enzymes (8Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Mazumder S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CaCl2 was added at this stage to a final concentration of 2 mm. The suspension was then centrifuged at 3300 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 5% sucrose in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. 5 ml each of this suspension was layered on to a 10-ml cushion of 20% sucrose in the same buffer in a corex tube. These were centrifuged in a Sorvall HB4 rotor at 1500 ×g for 30 min. The band at the interface of the two layers was highly enriched in flagella, whereas the pellet formed consisted largely of unsealed ghosts. The process was repeated twice, and the purified unsealed ghosts were utilized for the preparation of both sealed ghosts and everted vesicles. For preparation of sealed ghosts, unsealed ghost pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of a medium containing 20 mmHepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCl, and 10 mm CaCl2 at 35 °C for 40 min with gentle but continuous shaking. The suspension was then immediately cooled to 4 °C and was incubated with gentle shaking for another 30 min. The sealed ghosts obtained at this stage were pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 × g and resuspended in appropriate buffer for a particular experiment as described in the text. An electron microscopy picture of the sealed ghost from a typical preparation following this method is presented in Fig. 1 A. Sealing could also be achieved by replacing KCl (140 mm) with sucrose (250 mm). Presence of Ca2+ (10 mm) was, however, essential for proper sealing. Inside-out or everted vesicles were also prepared from unsealed ghosts. For this purpose, the unsealed ghosts were sheared into smaller membrane fragments, purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, washed, and finally sealed in presence of 25 mm Hepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 140 mm KCl, and 4 mmCa2+ or Mg2+ chloride. Everted vesicles were then pelleted, washed, and resuspended in appropriate buffer for subsequent experiments. Details of this procedure for preparing everted vesicles have been recently published (8Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Mazumder S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An electron microscopy picture of the everted vesicle is provided in Fig.1 B. Whenever necessary, everted vesicle could also be prepared in presence of sucrose (250 mm), Hepes-Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (20 mm), and Ca2+ (4 mm). This has been mentioned in the appropriate places in the text. Sealing of ghosts and of everted vesicles was confirmed with the help of fluorescent dye calcein by exploiting its self-quenching property at high concentrations (17Tsao Y. Huang L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and also by86Rb+ trapping (18Rottenberg H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Samples of sealed ghosts and everted vesicles were fixed with 3% gluteraldehyde for 15–20 h at 4 °C. After a wash with the respective buffers, the samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in Kellenburger buffer for 16–20 h at room temperature. The pellets were then washed again and dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol solutions and finally embedded in SPURRT resin. Thin sections were collected using an ultrathin microtome and picked up on copper grids. Observations were made in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL IN ex) at different magnifications. Both the unsealed ghost and the membrane fragment were sealed as described above in presence of BCECF at a concentration of 4 μg ml−1. For fluorescence measurements, the dye-loaded and washed everted vesicles (500 μg protein ml−1) were placed in a 1-ml fluorescence cuvette. A Hitachi spectrofluorimeter model F4010 was used to monitor the readings of BCECF at 505 nm excitation and at 525 nm emission wavelengths (19Ruben L. Hutchinson A. Mochlman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24351-24358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No appreciable leakage of the dye was observed during the period in which experiments were completed. Calibration of the internal pH of the everted vesicle was done by incubating the BCECF-loaded vesicle in a buffer containing 140 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Hepes-Tris buffer with varying pH (6.5–7.6) in presence of valinomycin (1 μg ml−1) and FCCP (5 μm). FCCP and valinomycin equilibrate the intracellular and extracellular proton and K+, respectively (20Hao L. Rigard J.L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14268-14275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pHi of the vesicle is assumed to be the same as the extracellular pH as the pHi and pHo become equal in presence of FCCP. A calibration curve was made by plotting the ratio of the fluorescence at 535 nm when the samples were excited at 503 and 440 nm, respectively, at various pH buffers (21Negulescu P.A. Machen T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 38-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and found to be linear between pH 6.5 and 7.6 (data not shown). For stoichiometric calculations, the H+ influx in the everted vesicle was calculated according to the method of Levy et al. (22Levy D. Seigneuret M. Bluzat A. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19524-19534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, H+ influx = Buffering capacity × ΔpH × internal volume. The development of transmembrane potential was measured fluorimetrically in the same instrument with bis-oxanol at λex535 nm and at λem at 559 mm (23Apell H.J. Bersch B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a final concentration of 80 nmdye was added to the cuvette containing vesicle suspension (400 μg protein ml−1) in sealing buffer pH 7.4. The average internal volumes of the sealed ghost and everted vesicle were determined by loading either with86RbCl or with [3H]inulin during the sealing process. These were then washed and counted. Internal volumes were calculated according to Rottenberg (18Rottenberg H. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 547-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Mg2+-ATPase activity was determined either colorimetrically by measuring the Mg2+-dependent release of inorganic phosphate or by measuring the liberation of 32P from [λ-32P]ATP. Whenever required, the concentration of free Mg2+ was controlled by complexation with CDTA. For colorimetric assay, the incubation medium contained in a total volume of 1 ml, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 μm CDTA with or without MgCl2, and 0.5 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by addition of everted vesicle (200 μg protein ml−1) as the source of enzyme. MgCl2concentration was varied to give the required free Mg2+concentration that was calculated according to Parshadsingh and McDonald (24Parshadsingh H.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4087-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was for 30 min at 28 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After removal of the precipitate, the released inorganic phosphate was measured following the method of Lowry and Lopez (25Lowry O.H. Lopez J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 845-850Google Scholar). To determine free Mg2+ concentration, Mg2+ from the vesicle (10 μm) and from other reagents (4 μm) were included in the calculations. Mg2+-stimulated ATPase activity was determined by subtracting the values with chelator alone from the values with Mg2+ and chelator. For the radioactive assay, the method of Bais (26Bais R. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was followed with few modifications. In this case, the final volume of the assay mixture was reduced to 0.1 ml. The composition and concentration of all the ingredients of the assay mixture remained the same as before. In this assay, 50 nmol of [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi) was added. After 10 min of incubation at 28 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. To this 10 μl of 100 mmKH2PO4 and 0.1 ml of suspension of 50% activated charcoal in water were added consecutively. After mild agitation for 10 min, charcoal was precipitated by centrifugation. The process was repeated once more, and finally 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial. pH gradient was imposed by using “pH jumps” (27Schumaker K.S. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12172-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were performed at 25 °C. To initiate the reaction, everted vesicles or sealed ghosts at pH 8.0 (protein concentration about 15 mg ml−1) were diluted 50-fold into mixtures containing sealing buffer of either pH 5.5 or 8 and 50 μm of [14C]2-deoxyglucose (1 μCi ml−1) or other additions as required. Each tube containing 500 μl of mixture was filtered at different time intervals through millipore filters (pore size, 0.8 μm) and washed with 10 ml of cold resuspension buffer, and trapped radiolabeled count was measured as described earlier (8Mandal D. Mukherjee T. Sarkar S. Mazumder S. Bhaduri A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Determination of polarity or sidedness of sealed vesicles or ghosts in the absence of a marker for plasma membrane often poses some problems. All flagellated trypanosomatids, including Leishmania have an unique cytoskeletal microtubular arrangement that can serve as an excellent marker for this purpose. Extensive cytological studies had earlier shown that these microtubular beads are closely associated with the inner lamina of the plasma membrane of intact cells (28Vickerman K. Pneston T.M. Lumsden W.H.R. Evans D.A. Biology of Kinetoplastida. Academic Press, New York1976: 35-130Google Scholar). This arrangement provides scaffolding and rigidity for the membrane structure and can be very conveniently used for determining polarity of closed structures. This is evident from the thin section electron photomicrograph of a typical sealed ghost that has an array of microtubules at regular intervals in the inner side of the ghost (Fig. 1 A). For this purpose, unsealed ghosts were sealed in presence of Ca2+(10 mm). The presence of Ca2+ was found to be an obligatory requirement, and it could not be replaced by other divalent cations. Mild hypotonic shock in the absence of drastic homogenization resulted in the preparation of deflagellated unsealed ghosts that retain most of the microtubular structure but lose all internal structures and cytoplasmic marker enzymes. In contrast to the sealed ghost preparation, the everted vesicles that were prepared from sheared plasma membrane were of smaller dimension and clearly displayed the marker microtubules on the outside (Fig. 1 B). The lesser number of microtubules were probably due to the shearing during the membrane preparation. Sealing was initially confirmed by calcein loading. Both the ghost and the everted vesicle are effectively impermeable within experimental time to cations such as 45Ca2+ and86Rb+. These ions could be rapidly released only in presence of A23187 and valinomycin, respectively. The average internal volume of sealed ghost was calculated to be 3.6 μl mg−1 protein (n = 4), and everted vesicle was 1.4 μl mg−1 protein (n = 4) (see “Materials and Methods”). The plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase, which is known to have its catalytic site on the cytoplasmic side, will display its catalytic site to the outer mileau in the everted vesicle. Rapid entry of H+ in the everted vesicle could be demonstrated only when both ATP and Mg2+ were added, indicating the Mg2+-ATPase to be responsible for H+ uptake. Addition of FCCP resulted in an immediate release of accumulated H+. ATP hydrolysis was obligatory for H+ entry as nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP completely failed to replace ATP (Fig. 2). No H+ uptake was observed on addition of Ca2+ and ATP, thus excluding any role for the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase in the process (data not shown). In a separate control experiment, we observed that unlike the everted vesicle, the sealed ghost with original polarity failed to show any significant uptake of H+ on addition of ATP and Mg2+ (data not shown). Clearly, ATP was not available to the catalytic site of Mg2+-ATPase in this case. Role of Mg2+-ATPase in H+ entry could be further confirmed when an excellent correlation between activity of the enzyme and translocation of H+ could be demonstrated in the everted vesicle with the help of a reversible thiol-modifying reagent. We found that the enzyme could be completely inactivated (>95%) byp-chloromercaribenzoate (0.5 mm) in 20 min, DTNB (1 mm) in 30 min, and N-ethylmealamide (1 mm) in 40 min. Subsequent incubation with excess dithiothreitol (10 mm) could reactivate (>60%) both thep-chloromercuribenzoic acid and DTNB-inactivated enzymes (data not shown). Based on these observations, an experiment was set up to monitor the possible correlation between enzyme activity and capacity for H+ uptake. Fig.3 shows that an excellent correlation exist between Mg2+-ATPase activity and the initial rate of H+ transport (first 2 min) in the everted vesicle, leaving little doubt that the plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase is exclusively responsible for H+ translocation across the plasma membrane. Table I summarizes the results of an experiment in which H+ accumulation in the everted vesicle at the end of 5 min was monitored in presence of some nucleotide triphosphates and inhibitors. ATP could not be replaced to any significant extent by any of the other triphosphates tried. Strong inhibition by orthovanadate suggests the H+ translocator to be a P-type ATPase. Inhibition of this enzyme activity by vanadate (29Anderson S.A. Mukkada A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and formation of β-aspartyl phosphate intermediate (30Anderson S.A. Jiang S. Mukkada A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1195: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were earlier shown by other workers. Most importantly, omeprazole and SCH28080 both specific inhibitors for gastric H+,K+-ATPase (31Hersey S.J. Sachs G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 155-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) showed strong inhibitory influence on H+ accumulation. Direct participation of Na+,K+-ATPase or of a V-type ATPase in H+ pumping could be ruled out because neither ouabain nor bafilomycin A1 showed any effect on H+ accumulation (32Ross A. Boron W.F. Intracellular pH Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 33Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendrof K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). To analyze more carefully the extent of inhibition that can be achieved by omeprazole and by SCH28080, the initial rate of H+ entry (first 2 min) was followed with increasing concentrations of these two inhibitors and vanadate. The experimental protocol was the same as in Table I. Both the drugs inhibited the entry process (up to 95 and 75%, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner. IC50 for omeprazole and SCH28080 were 50 and 40 μm, respectively. Omeprazole could effectively abolish H+ influx (>90%) at 150 μm, whereas SCH28080 at that concentration had a less pronounced effect. The inhibitory effect of omeprazole compared favorably well with that of vanadate (data not shown). These results suggested that the parasite H+ translocating plasma membrane Mg2+-ATPase may have some enzymological and physiological properties that may be similar to the mammalian gastric H+,K+-ATPase (34Rabon E.C. Ruben M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Table IEffect of energy sources and potential inhibitors on H+transport in everted vesiclesAdditionH+ pumping activity%ATP (1 mm)100CTP (1 mm)05GTP (1 mm)03UTP (1 mm)20AMP-PNP (1 mm)03DCCD (100 μm)50Oligomycin (5 μg ml−1)96Vanadate (100 μm)18Ouabain (250 μm)90Bafilomycin A1 (5 μm)98Omeprazole (50 μm)51SCH28080 (50 μm)55For this experiment vesicles were preincubated as described in the legend to Fig. 2.
