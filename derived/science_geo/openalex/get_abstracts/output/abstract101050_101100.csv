The cholesterol efflux kinetics are different if cells are incubated with HDL3, which induces a relatively constant rate of release of cholesterol throughout an 8-h incubation. Cholesterol efflux to cyclodextrins was much greater than phospholipid release. To test the hypothesis that maximal efflux rate constants for a particular cell are independent of the type of acceptor, we estimated the maximal rate constants for efflux (Vmax) of cellular cholesterol from L-cells, Fu5AH cells, and GM3468A fibroblasts. The rate constant for HDL3-mediated efflux varied among cell lines in the order Fu5AH > L-cells > fibroblasts. However, these differences were not evident when cyclodextrins were used as cholesterol acceptors. The estimated Vmax values for cyclodextrin-mediated efflux were 3.5-70-fold greater than for HDL3 for the three cell lines. The very high efficiency of cyclodextrins in stimulating cell cholesterol efflux suggests that these compounds can be used in two general ways for studies of atherosclerosis: 1) as research tools to probe mechanisms of cholesterol transport and aspects of membrane structure or 2) as potential pharmacological agents that could modify in vivo cholesterol metabolism and influence the development of the atherosclerotic plaque.

The first step in reverse cholesterol transport is the efflux of cellular cholesterol to a suitable acceptor, and this process is thought to be mediated by HDL1 1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMEMEagle's minimum essential mediumFBSfetal bovine serumβCDβ-cyclodextrinMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrin2OHpβCD2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. or specific HDL subclasses(1Glomset J.A.

Although extensively investigated, the exact mechanism underlying the movement of cholesterol molecules from the plasma membrane to extracellular acceptors remains controversial. Although the generally accepted mechanism is now thought to involve the movement of cholesterol molecules from the cell membrane through the aqueous phase to the acceptor particle (i.e. aqueous diffusion mechanism)(2Johnson W.J.

Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Stern W.C. Drug News Perspect. 1989; 2: 410Google Scholar), and derivatives of β-cyclodextrins have been made by chemical modifications of the hydroxyl groups which greatly improve their solubility and their ability to dissolve hydrophobic compounds, as well as reducing their toxicity(9DeCaprio J. Yun J. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 441-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Frijlink H.W. Eissens A.C. Hefting N.R. Poelstra K. Lerk C.F. Meijer K.F. Pharm. Res.

In vitro, β-cyclodextrins have a high affinity for sterols as compared to other lipids(11Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and, because of the relatively high specificity of β-cyclodextrins for cholesterol, it has been suggested that these compounds might be effective in modifying cholesterol metabolism in vivo(11Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Riottot M. Olivier P. Huet A. Caboche J.J. Parquet M. Khallou J. Lutton C. Lipids. 1993; 28: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It can be proposed that cyclodextrins can be used in two general ways for studies of atherosclerosis: 1) as research tools to probe mechanisms of cholesterol transport and aspects of membrane structure or 2) as potential pharmacological agents that could modify in vivo cholesterol metabolism and influence the development of the atherosclerotic plaque. Although there is extensive literature on cyclodextrins, relatively little has been published on their ability to influence cholesterol metabolism, either in vitro or in vivo. It has been demonstrated by Frijlink et al.(10Frijlink H.W. Eissens A.C. Hefting N.R. Poelstra K. Lerk C.F. Meijer K.F. Pharm. Res. (NY). 1991; 8: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that injection of either β-cyclodextrin or 2OHpβCD (200 mg/kg dose) resulted in transient decreases in both serum-unesterified and total cholesterol. It has been proposed that the cholesterol-lowering effect of the cyclodextrins was due to their ability to efficiently cross the capillary wall and to function as cholesterol carriers that redistribute cholesterol from the interstitial space to the plasma compartment(10Frijlink H.W. Eissens A.C. Hefting N.R. Poelstra K. Lerk C.F. Meijer K.F. Pharm. Res. (NY). 1991; 8: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), after which it was rapidly cleared in the urine. It is believed that the cyclodextrin-cholesterol complexes are processed within the kidneys. Within the kidneys, the dissociation of cholesterol from the carrier cyclodextrin can result in the deposition of cholesterol and the associated nephrotoxicity sometimes associated with cyclodextrins(10Frijlink H.W. Eissens A.C. Hefting N.R. Poelstra K. Lerk C.F. Meijer K.F. Pharm. Res. (NY). 1991; 8: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that exposure of fibroblasts to cyclodextrins can produce cell toxicity, and that the extent of this toxicity is reduced by the presence of serum(6Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Exposure of erythrocytes to cyclodextrins results in hemolysis in the order of β > α > γ(14Irie T. Otagiri M. Sunada M. Uekama K. Ohtani Y. Yamada Y. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1982; 5: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This hemolysis may be attributed to the removal of erythrocyte membrane components, particularly cholesterol. Extensive release of erythrocyte cholesterol can be achieved upon incubation of the cells with the acceptor(11Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). What is particularly intriguing about the interaction of cyclodextrins with erythrocytes is the rapidity of the movement of cholesterol from the cells to the incubation medium, with half-times (t) of apparently less than 1 min(11Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This rapid exchange is in contrast to that previously reported for the exchange or transfer of cholesterol from erythrocytes to serum or isolated lipoproteins, which is in the range of 1-8 h (for a review, see (15Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar)). It was this very fast exchange rate that prompted us to conduct the present detailed study of the characteristics of cholesterol movement between cells in culture and cyclodextrins. MEM, DMEM, and Ham's F12 were obtained from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Calf serum, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and gentamicin were purchased from Sigma. Media were buffered with sodium bicarbonate (2 g/liter), and cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. All media were supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine and 50 μg of gentamicin/ml. Mouse L-cell fibroblasts and GM3468A human fibroblasts were cultured in MEM with 10% FBS, and Fu5AH cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 5% calf serum. Cells were plated in 16- or 22-mm wells 3 to 7 days prior to efflux experiments (1 × 105 cells per well for 12-well plates and 0.5 × 105 per well for 24-well plates). Pretreatments were started when the cells were about 90% confluent, except for GM3468A fibroblasts, which were used 2 to 4 days after reaching confluency. Cells were labeled for 24 h with medium containing 1 or 2 μCi of [3H]cholesterol/ml (0.1% ethanol final concentration) and 2.5% FBS (1 ml/well). [1,2-3H]Cholesterol was obtained from DuPont NEN and checked for purity by thin layer chromatography prior to use(16Mahlberg F.H. Rodriguez-Oquendo A. Bernard D.W. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 84: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were incubated with medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 24 h to allow for equilibration of the radioactive isotope in the various cellular cholesterol pools. An acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase inhibitor, Sandoz 58-035, was added during both labeling and equilibration (1 μg/ml, 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide final concentration, Sandoz compound 58-035 was a gift from Dr. John Heider). After labeling and equilibration, cells were rinsed three times with medium supplemented with only gentamicin and were then switched to medium containing various cholesterol acceptors. This medium was buffered with 50 mM Hepes (Life Technologies, Inc.) instead of sodium bicarbonate. Cells were incubated for 10 min to 8 h in a shaking water bath (40 rpm) at 37°C, and 50-μl aliquots were taken out for the liquid scintillation counter at various time points. Cholesterol acceptors used in these studies were varying concentrations of either HDL3, β-cyclodextrin (βCD, Sigma, C-4805), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2OHpβCD, Sigma, C-0926), or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, Sigma, C-4555). HDL3 (d = 1.125-1.21 g/ml) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of human plasma according to Hatch and Lees(17Hatch F.T. Lees R.S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1968; 6: 1-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers (before and after the incubation with acceptors) were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted with 2-propanol overnight(18McCloskey H.M. Rothblat G.H. Glick J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An internal standard (cholesteryl methyl ether, Sigma) was added to the wells prior to extraction, and cholesterol was measured by gas-liquid chromatography using a 50% phenylmethyl polysiloxane column(19Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An extra set of cells was harvested at the beginning of the efflux period to determine initial cellular [3H]cholesterol and cholesterol mass. Cell protein was determined on the remaining monolayer using a modification of the method of Markwell et al.(20Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Cell protein was dissolved in a solution of 0.1 N NaOH and 1% SDS, and duplicate aliquots were taken out for protein determinations. Efflux was calculated from the fraction of initial [3H]cholesterol remaining in the cells at each time point. For time course experiments, these data were fitted to a single exponential model using nonlinear regression as described previously (21Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equation used was y = A•e−B•t+ C, in which y is the fraction of initial cell [3H]cholesterol remaining in the cells and t is the incubation time in hours. The apparent rate constant for efflux of cellular cholesterol, ke, is the initial slope of the efflux curve and can be calculated using ke = A•B, and the values are the average of triplicate determinations. Approximations of maximal efflux rate constants were derived from the keversus ke/[S] plot, in analogy with a Hofstee plot used to determine maximal velocities for enzyme reactions. In this plot, the intercept with the y axis is the maximal ke, and the substrate concentration at which half of the maximal rate constant for efflux is reached, the Km, is the slope of the regression line. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare treatments. L-cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well (35-mm wells) in 2 ml of MEM containing 10% FBS and 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline chloride/ml (NET-109) and grown to confluency for 4 days. Subsequently, cells were rinsed three times with MEM and incubated with MEM plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were then rinsed again, and efflux was started by incubating the cells with 1 ml of medium per well for 2 h at 37°C. Separate wells were used to determine initial cell 3H-phospholipid and cell phospholipid mass. Incubation media were MEM alone as a control, MEM containing HDL3 (0.2 or 0.5 mg of phospholipid/ml), or cyclodextrins (βCD, 2OHpβCD, or MβCD at 2 or 5 mM). At the end of the incubation, media were collected and 800 μl was used for phospholipid extraction. For both the t0 cellular 3H-phospholipid and the medium 3H-phospholipid counts at t = 2 h, samples were extracted according to Bielicki et al.(22Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1699-1710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove non-phospholipid [3H]choline counts. Phospholipid efflux was expressed as the percentage release of initial cell 3H-phospholipid to the medium after 2 h of incubation. Initial cell phospholipid mass was used to calculate the specific activity of the labeled phospholipids to predict the released phospholipid mass. Direct mass determinations of released cell cholesterol and phospholipid were conducted on the media from L-cells exposed to 10 mM 2OHpβCD for 2 h at 37°C. There was a tendency of the cyclodextrin to co-extract with lipids if the traditional chloroform-methanol extraction procedures were employed, and the presence of cyclodextrins complicated the subsequent mass determinations. To circumvent this problem, media containing the 2OHpβCD was extracted twice with 2× volumes of methylene chloride, followed by 2 additional extractions with 1× volume of ethyl ether. After combining and drying the extraction solvents, the cholesterol was determined as described previously(23Kilsdonk E.P.C. Morel D.W. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 36: 505-516Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Phospholipid mass was determined by the method described by Sokoloff and Rothblat (24Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and was sensitive to at least 0.1 μg of phosphorus. Isotopic amounts of radiolabeled cholesterol and phospholipid were added to the media prior to extraction to monitor lipid recoveries. The recovery of cholesterol was 105%± 3%, the recovery of phospholipid from the incubation media was 81%± 6%. The release of cellular adenine, as described by Reid et al.(25Reid V.C. Brabbs C.E. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 92: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was used to monitor membrane integrity. To label the intracellular adenosine pool of L-cells, cells were pretreated the same as described above for efflux experiments, and, in addition, 0.5 μCi of [8-14C]adenine (Amersham) per ml was added to the equilibration medium. Before efflux medium was added, the wells were rinsed extensively with MEM/gentamicin to remove extracellularly bound [14C]adenine. The release of cellular adenine was monitored by removing 75-μl medium aliquots, filtering through 0.45-μm Multiscreen filtration plates (Millipore), and counting 50-μl aliquots. The initial amount of cellular [14C]adenine was quantified by dissolving the cells in 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100. The total cell association of [14C]2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ([14C]2OHpβCD; CTD Inc., Gainesville, FL) to L-cells was determined by incubation with 0-20 mM 2OHpβCD (specific activity between 70 and 1960 dpm/nmol) for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were then rinsed, and cell monolayers were dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH. Aliquots were used for liquid scintillation counting and protein determinations. The high efficacy of three types of β-cyclodextrin for stimulating the efflux of L-cell [3H]cholesterol is shown in Fig. 1. β-Cyclodextrin (βCD), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2OHpβCD), and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) all induced a concentration-dependent release of cellular cholesterol. MβCD was more efficient than the two other cyclodextrins. Nearly 90% of cellular [3H]cholesterol was released after 8 h of incubation with 10 mM MβCD. Table 1 gives the sterol mass of L-cells after 8 h of incubation with 2OHpβCD and MβCD. Since L-cells cannot synthesize cholesterol(26Rothblat G.H. Burns C.H. Conner R.L. Landrey J.R. Science. 1970; 169: 880-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the fractional release of labeled cholesterol is equal to the decrease of cellular cholesterol mass (compare Fig. 1 and Table 1). MβCD also produced a larger fractional release of cellular desmosterol than the other cyclodextrins.TABLE I Open table in a new tab A comparison of the time course of cellular [3H]cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL3 or by various concentrations of 2OHpβCD is shown in Fig. 2. There was no significant efflux of [3H]cholesterol when cells were incubated with medium without any cholesterol acceptor. HDL3 induced efflux of cholesterol at a relatively constant rate during the 8-h time course. However, 2OHpβCD induced a more rapid rate of cholesterol release than HDL3, even when present at the lowest concentration of 2 mM. The initial fast rate of [3H]cholesterol release diminished after 1 to 2 h, until an apparent equilibrium was reached between the labeled cholesterol in the medium and in the cells. Thus, the kinetics for the efflux of cellular cholesterol are very different when cyclodextrin is compared to HDL3. The kinetics of the cholesterol efflux time course studies (Fig. 2) suggested that incubation of L-cells with cyclodextrin resulted in the rapid equilibration of labeled cholesterol between cells and medium. Table 2 shows the estimated molar ratio of cell free cholesterol to cyclodextrin in the incubation medium after 8 h exposure of L-cells to the cholesterol acceptors. The molar cell-free cholesterol:cyclodextrin ratio was approximately 1:1900 for 2OHpβCD, and 1:1300 for βCD, respectively. These ratios were obtained at both 2 mM and 5 mM concentrations of the cyclodextrins. These results indicate that cholesterol equilibrates between the cells and the available cyclodextrin molecules in the medium, and that the final ratio is dependent on the affinity of cholesterol for the type of cyclodextrin that is present.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The cyclodextrin-mediated release of a major portion of cell cholesterol mass, as shown in Table 1, might be expected to deplete plasma membrane cholesterol and result in cell toxicity. To test for the presence of CD-induced cell toxicity, cells were preincubated with labeled adenine, the subsequent release of which serves as a measure of cell membrane integrity(25Reid V.C. Brabbs C.E. Mitchinson M.J. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 92: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Shirhatti V. Krishna G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The release of cellular [14C]adenine after an 8-h incubation of L-cells with MEM alone or various concentrations of cyclodextrins was inversely correlated with the cell total sterol content (Fig. 3). The higher the concentrations of cyclodextrins the greater the depletion of cell sterol and the greater the leak of [14C]adenine (Fig. 3). At equivalent concentrations, MβCD was more toxic than 2OHpβCD, consistent with its greater ability to promote cholesterol efflux. The results shown in Fig. 3 were obtained from studies in which cells were extensively depleted of cell cholesterol by long incubations with CD, therefore, a time course for the release of labeled adenine was done using various acceptors. Fig. 4 shows the results for incubations of 2 and 8 h. The pattern for the release of labeled adenine obtained after 8 h of incubation was similar to that previously observed (Fig. 3); however, release of adenine above background levels was not evident after a shorter exposure of cell to the acceptors (2 h), even at the highest concentration of β-cyclodextrins (10 and 20 mM). This indicates that toxicity occurs only after prolonged incubations with cyclodextrins, but not during the first initial rapid phase of efflux.Figure 4:Release of L-cell [14C]adenine after 2 or 8 h of incubation with various acceptors. [14C]Adenine-labeled L-cells were incubated with either MEM alone, HDL3 (0.2 mg of phospholipid/ml), or cyclodextrins at the indicated concentrations. The amount of cellular [14C]adenine released to the medium was measured by removing and counting medium aliquots after 2 and 8 h of incubation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although β-cyclodextrins are reported to have a relatively high specificity for sterols compared to phospholipids(11Irie T. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 28Uekama K. Masaki O. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 1987; 3: 1-40PubMed Google Scholar), it is important to know the amount of cyclodextrin-mediated release of cellular phospholipids in order to acquire information on the mechanism by which cyclodextrins promote cellular cholesterol efflux. To quantitate the fractional release of cell phospholipids, L-cells were grown in [3H]choline as described under “Materials and Methods” to label phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, the 2 major phospholipids in cell plasma membranes. Subsequent incubation in medium supplemented with cyclodextrins or HDL3 provided an estimate of the fractional release of phospholipids from the cells (Fig. 5). The fractional release of cellular phospholipids was small; maximally, 2% of cellular phospholipids were released after 4 h of incubation with 5 mM MβCD. This value is similar to that obtained with high concentrations of HDL3 and considerably lower than that observed for cholesterol efflux. An attempt was made to quantitate the actual mass of phospholipid present in the medium after a 2-h incubation of L-cells with 10 mM 2OHpβCD. Under conditions where from 38% to 64% of the cell pool of sterol (average 9.5 μg of sterol/well; 80% cholesterol, 20% desmosterol) was recovered, no measurable phospholipid was detected in the media (sensitivity of assay = 2.5 μg of phospholipid) from monolayers having 115 ± 8 μg of phospholipid/well. Previously, it has been observed that the rate of cholesterol release from various cells differs considerably depending on the individual tissue culture cell line(29Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Bellini F. Phillips M.C. Pickell C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The differences in the relative rates of cholesterol release among cells is observed with any phospholipid-containing acceptor including vesicles, reconstituted and native lipoproteins, and whole serum(29Rothblat G.H.

To determine if cell-specific fractional efflux values persisted when the very efficient and phospholipid-free cyclodextrins served as cholesterol acceptors, a series of acceptor-dose experiments were conducted comparing L-cell mouse fibroblasts, Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells, and GM3468A human skin fibroblasts. HDL3, 2OHpβCD, and MβCD served as acceptors. Incubation times of 10 min were used for the cyclodextrins and 30 min for the HDL3 in order to approximate the initial rates of cell cholesterol release. Fig. 6 shows the dose-response curves for the three cell types on three different acceptors. It is clear from the data in Fig. 6A that with HDL as the acceptor the differences in ke among cell types was as previously reported (Fu5AH L-cell > fibroblasts)(29Rothblat G.H. Bamberger M. Phillips M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 628-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the HDL data, the same cell specificity, in terms of cholesterol efflux, was not apparent when either 2OHpβCD (Fig. 6B) or MβCD (Fig. 6C) served as acceptors. With the cyclodextrins, cholesterol efflux from the human fibroblasts and Fu5AH hepatoma cells was similar and slightly greater than that for L-cells. The data presented in Fig. 6 can be used to obtain estimates of the maximum rate of cellular cholesterol release for each cell type-acceptor combination. This estimate of Vmax for cholesterol efflux is derived from V versus V/[S] plots, where V is the fractional release of cholesterol per h and [S] is the concentration of acceptor, in analogy with a Hofstee plot used to determine maximal velocities for enzyme reactions(34Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. Wiley, New York1976Google Scholar). Estimated Vmax values for the 3 cell types are shown in Fig. 7 and illustrate that in contrast to the results with HDL as an acceptor, the 2 cyclodextrins yielded similar Vmax values that did not differ between the"

PI hydrolysis produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, leading to activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which can stimulate increased MAPK activity. However, the relationship between PI hydrolysis and MAPK activation in Gi and Gq signaling has not been clearly defined and is the subject of this study. The effects of several signaling inhibitors are assessed including expression of a peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the β adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARKct), which specifically blocks signaling mediated by the βγ subunits of G proteins (Gβγ), expression of dominant negative mutants of p21ras (RasN17) and p74raf-1 (NΔRaf), protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors and cellular depletion of PKC. The Gi-coupled α2A adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulates MAPK activation which is blocked by expression of βARKct, RasN17, or NΔRaf, or by PTK inhibitors, but unaffected by cellular depletion of PKC. In contrast, MAPK activation stimulated by the Gq-coupled α1B AR or M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor is unaffected by expression of βARKct or RasN17 expression or by PTK inhibitors, but is blocked by expression of NΔRaf or by PKC depletion. These data demonstrate that Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors stimulate MAPK activation via distinct signaling pathways. Gβγ is responsible for mediating Gi-coupled receptor-stimulated MAPK activation through a mechanism utilizing p21ras and p74raf independent of PKC. In contrast, Gα mediates Gq-coupled receptor-stimulated MAPK activation using a p21ras-independent mechanism employing PKC and p74raf. To define the role of Gβγ in Gi-coupled receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis and MAPK activation, direct stimulation with Gβγ was used. Expression of Gβγ resulted in MAPK activation that was sensitive to inhibition by expression of βARKct, RasN17, or NΔRaf or by PTK inhibitors, but insensitive to PKC depletion. By comparison, Gβγ-mediated PI hydrolysis was not affected by βARKct, RasN17, or NΔRaf expression or by PTK inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2011452349,"The β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity in the lepidopteran insect cell line Sf21 has been studied using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides and chromogenic synthetic glycosides as substrates. Ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that the insect cell β-N-acetylglucosaminidase exists in a soluble and a membrane-bound form. This latter form accounted for two-thirds of the total activity and was associated with vesicles of the same density as those containing GlcNAc-transferase I. Partial membrane association of the enzyme was observed with all substrates tested, i.e. 4-nitrophenyl β-N-acetylglucosaminide, tri-N-acetylchitotriose, and an N-linked biantennary agalactooligosaccharide. Inhibition studies indicated a single enzyme to be responsible for the hydrolysis of all these substrates. With the biantennary substrate, the β-N-acetylglucosaminidase exclusively removed β-N-acetylglucosamine from the α1,3-antenna. GlcNAcMan5GlcNAc2, the primary product of GlcNAc-transferase I, was not perceptibly hydrolyzed. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidases with the same branch specificity were also found in the lepidopteran cell lines Bm-N and Mb-0503. In contrast, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activities from rat or frog (Xenopus laevis) liver and from mung bean seedlings were not membrane-bound, and they did not exhibit a strict branch specificity. An involvement of this unusual β-N-acetylglucosaminidase in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides in insects is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2060419524,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) is widely recognized as mediator of NO toxicity, but recent studies have indicated that this compound may also have physiological activity and induce vascular relaxation as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation. We found that ONOO− induced a pronounced increase in endothelial cyclic GMP levels, and that this effect was significantly attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with GSH-depleting agents. In the presence of 2 mM GSH, ONOO− stimulated purified soluble guanylyl cyclase with a half-maximally effective concentration of about 20 μM. In contrast to the NO donor 2,2-Diethyl-1-nitroso-oxyhydrazine sodium salt (DEA/NO), ONOO− was completely inactive in the absence of GSH, indicating that thiol-mediated bioactivation of ONOO− is involved in enzyme stimulation. Studies on the reaction between ONOO− and GSH revealed that about 1% of ONOO− was non-enzymatically converted to S-nitrosoglutathione. The authentic nitrosothiol was found to be stable in solution, but slowly decomposed in the presence of GSH. GSH-induced decomposition of S-nitrosoglutathione was apparently catalyzed by trace metals and was accompanied by a sustained release of NO and a 40-100-fold increase in its potency to stimulate purified soluble guanylyl cyclase.

Enhanced biological activity of NO in the presence of SOD has indicated that superoxide contributes to the inactivation of NO (17Gryglewski R.J. Palmer R.M.J. Moncada S. Nature. 1986; 320: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar) due to a fast reaction of NO with O2− to yield peroxynitrite (ONOO−)(18Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A.

ONOO− is stable in alkaline solutions, but a species with hydroxyl radical-like properties is generated as intermediate upon protonation of ONOO− to the corresponding peroxynitrous acid(19Crow J.P.

More recently, it was demonstrated that ONOO− apparently mediates several effects previously attributed to NO, e.g. covalent modification of glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (24Mohr S. Stamler J.S. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and inhibition of aconitase(25Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Together with the finding that activated macrophages release most of their NO as ONOO−(27Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), these results suggest that decomposition of ONOO− at physiological pH may be a major component of NO cytotoxicity. Recent reports indicate that ONOO− also may have beneficial effects. Solutions of authentic ONOO− were shown to induce relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (28Liu S. Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J.

Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1114-1121PubMed Google Scholar) speculated that relaxation may be due to small amounts of NO spontaneously released during ONOO− decomposition, and Wu et al.(29Wu M.D. Pritchard K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar) reported on pronounced increases in NO release when ONOO− was incubated in the presence of GSH or tissue homogenates. Similarly, Moro et al.(30Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamorapino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is conceivable, therefore, that the NO-like properties of ONOO− are due to S-nitrosation of cellular proteins or GSH. However, the nitrosating potential of ONOO− is being discussed controversially. Wink et al.(31Wink D.A. Nims R.W. Darbyshire J.F. Christodoulou D. Hanbauer I. Cox G.W. Laval F. Laval J. Cook J.A.

Recombinant bovine lung soluble guanylyl cyclase was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously(5Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.-D.

[α-32P]GTP (400 Ci/mmol) was purchased from MedPro (Amersham), Vienna, Austria; the other chemicals were from Sigma, Vienna, Austria. Porcine aortic endothelial cells were cultured as described previously(36Schmidt K. Mayer B. Kukovetz W.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 170: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Mayer B. Brunner F. Schmidt K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic treatment (0.1% collagenase) and cultured up to 3 passages in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Vienna, Austria) containing 3% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Prior to experiments, endothelial cells were subcultured in 24-well plastic plates and grown to confluence (˜2 × 105 cells/dish). For depletion of GSH, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of different concentrations of CDNB or DEM prior to experiments. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once and equilibrated in incubation buffer (isotonic 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 1 μM indomethacin). After 15 min, ONOO− or DEA/NO were added to give the initial final concentrations as indicated, and reactions were stopped 4 min later by removal of the incubation buffer and treatment for 1 h with 1 ml of 0.01 N HCl. Intracellular cGMP was measured in the supernatants of the lysed cells by radioimmunoassay. The DTNB colorimetric method (38Beutler E. Duron O. Kelly B.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 61: 882-888PubMed Google Scholar) was used for determination of GSH, which represents the only measurable soluble thiol in endothelial cells(39Ghigo D. Alessio P. Foco A. Bussolino F. Costamagna C. Heller R. Garbarino G. Pescarmona G.P. Bosia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C728-C732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Petri dishes (diameter 90 mm), and confluent monolayers (˜5 × 106 cells/dish) were preincubated in culture medium at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of increasing concentrations of thiol-depleting agents or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). Cells were washed and equilibrated for 15 min in incubation buffer (see above). Subsequent to aspiration of the supernatant, 1 ml of a 2% (w/v) solution of 5-sulfosalicylic acid was added for cell lysis and deproteinization. Samples were centrifuged and aliquots of 0.5 ml mixed with 0.5 ml of a 300 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM DTNB. After 5 min, the absorbance at 412 nm was measured and the amount of soluble thiols quantitated by comparison with GSH standards. The extinction coefficient of the chromophore was 14.3 mM-1 cm-1 under these conditions, which is closely similar to the reported value of 13.6 mM-1 cm-1(38Beutler E. Duron O. Kelly B.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 61: 882-888PubMed Google Scholar). Purified soluble guanylyl cyclase (0.15 μg) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in a total volume of 0.2 ml of a triethanolamine/HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mM [α-32P]GTP (200,000-300,000 cpm), 3 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM cGMP in the absence and presence of 2 mM GSH. Reactions were started by addition of 20-fold stock solutions of ONOO−, DEA/NO, or GSNO and stopped by ZnCO3 precipitation followed by isolation of [32P]cGMP by column chromatography as described(40Schultz G. Böhme E. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Gra M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1984: 379-389Google Scholar). In some experiments, sGC was preincubated for 2 min at 37°C in the presence of 2 mM GSH and different concentrations of ONOO− prior to further stimulation of the enzyme for 8 min with 10 μM DEA/NO in a total incubation volume of 0.2 ml. Results were corrected for enzyme-deficient blanks and recovery of cGMP. For analysis of S-nitrosated compounds derived from the reaction of ONOO− with GSH, the authentic compounds (1 mM each) were incubated for 2 min in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH values ranging from 6.0 to 8.5, and 30-μl samples were injected onto a 250 × 4-mm C18 reversed-phase column equipped with a 4 × 4-mm C18 precolumn for HPLC analysis (LiChroGraph L 6200, LiChrospher 100 RP-18, 5-μm particle size, Merck). Elution was performed isocratically at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5% (v/v) methanol. Absorbance was continuously monitored at 338 nm (LiChroGraph L 4250, Merck) to detect S-nitrosated products. The method was calibrated daily with freshly prepared solutions of authentic GSNO. Identification of the reaction product was based on coelution with authentic GSNO in the following solvents: (i) 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, 5% (v/v) methanol; (ii) 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; (iii) 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) methanol; (iv) 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5% (v/v) methanol; and (v) acetonitrile, H2O, acetic acid (2.5:97.5:0.1, v/v), yielding retention times of 6.3, 4.4, 4.1, 3.3, and 2.2 min, respectively.

Stability of GSNO was assessed spectroscopically with a diode array spectrophotometer (8452A, Hewlett Packard, Vienna, Austria) in the absence and presence of 1 mM GSH. Release of NO was measured aerobically with a commercially available Clark-type electrode (Iso-NO, World Precision Instruments, Mauer, Germany) as described previously(16Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Samples were injected through a septum into completely filled vials to avoid interphase mass transfer. Calibration of the electrode was performed daily and showed linear response from 10 nM to 1 μM NO with an average slope of 0.8 nM NO/pA output current. As shown in Fig. 1, ONOO− increased cGMP levels in cultured endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of about 0.2 mM. Maximal effects were comparable to those elicited by the NO donor DEA/NO, which raised intracellular cGMP levels up to ˜50 pmol/106 cells with an EC50 of 0.2 μM. Inactivated ONOO− (1 mM) induced only marginal accumulation of cGMP (from 2.4 ± 0.8 to 4.7 ± 1.1 pmol/106 cells; n = 3). Control experiments performed with NaNO2 showed that 0.1 and 1 mM nitrite enhanced endothelial cGMP levels to 3.1 ± 0.28 and 8.1 ± 1.04 pmol/106 cells (n = 3), respectively, indicating that nitrite, which was present in the ONOO− stock solutions at about equimolar concentration, was responsible for the marginal effect of inactivated ONOO−. To investigate whether intracellular GSH mediates ONOO−-induced cGMP accumulation, cells were pretreated for 30 min with increasing concentrations of the GSH-depleting agents CDNB or DEM(41Meister A. Science. 1983; 220: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that CDNB (1-100 μM) decreased endothelial GSH levels in a concentration-dependent manner and significantly reduced maximal peroxynitrite-induced cGMP accumulation, whereas the effect of the NO donor DEA/NO remained unaffected. As shown in Fig. 2B, DEM had very similar effects, albeit at higher concentrations. At the used concentrations, neither of the two agents did induce any detectable release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium (not shown). The GSH levels measured under control conditions (˜10 nmol/106 cells) are in excellent accordance with values reported previously for cultured endothelial cells(42Murphy M.E. Piper H.M. Watanabe H. Sies H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19378-19383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on an endothelial cell volume of 1 pl(43Baydoun A.R. Emery P.W. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), this corresponds to intracellular GSH concentrations of approximately 10 mM. Subsequently, we have performed experiments with purified sGC to get insights into the mechanisms accounting for ONOO−-induced cGMP accumulation. Incubations have been performed in the absence and presence of 2 mM exogenously added GSH, but it should be noted that sGC preparations contained endogenous GSH for stabilization of the enzyme during purification(5Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.-D. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Böhme E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, final dilutions of sGC resulted in GSH concentrations of less then 10 μM during incubations. Basal sGC activities were 40.0 ± 13.2 and 78.8 ± 15.8 nmol of cGMP × mg-1× min-1 (mean ± S.E.; n = 11) in the absence and presence of 2 mM GSH, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, ONOO− had no effect on cGMP formation at concentrations of up to 1 mM in the absence of the added thiol, but markedly stimulated the enzyme in the presence of 2 mM GSH. The effect was biphasic with a sharp maximum at 0.1 mM and an EC50 of approximately 20 μM ONOO−. The sGC activities maximally achievable with ONOO− were about 650 nmol cGMP × mg-1× min-1 and thus considerably lower than those observed in the presence of DEA/NO (˜4 μmol × mg-1× min-1) or GSNO (˜1 μmol × mg-1× min-1) (see below). The effect of ONOO− was virtually abolished (1.5-fold stimulation) when it had been inactivated by incubation for 5 min at pH 7.5 prior to experiments. As observed with endothelial cells, this marginal stimulation of sGC was mimicked by authentic nitrite, which induced a 1.6-fold stimulation of the enzyme at a concentration of 0.1 mM (not shown). It has been suggested that protein SH-groups may be critically involved in the regulation of sGC(44Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), indicating that the effect of GSH on ONOO−-induced enzyme stimulation could reflect reduction of protein sulfhydryls essential for sGC stimulation. To address this issue, we have additionally studied the effect of GSH on cGMP accumulation induced by the spontaneous NO donor DEA/NO. Fig. 3B shows that DEA/NO potently stimulated purified sGC with an EC50 of about 50 nM even in the absence of GSH. Addition of GSH (2 mM) did not potentiate the effect of DEA/NO but, instead, induced a rightward shift of the concentration response curve resulting in an EC50 of DEA/NO of about 0.3 μM without affecting maximal guanylyl cyclase activity. These data demonstrate that ONOO−-induced but not NO-induced stimulation of sGC requires presence of GSH, suggesting that the effect of the thiol is related to bioactivation of ONOO−. The biphasic effect of ONOO− and the incomplete activation of sGC indicated that the enzyme may be inhibited or inactivated by high concentrations of ONOO−. To investigate this, we have preincubated sGC for 2 min with increasing concentrations of ONOO− prior to addition of DEA/NO (10 μM). TableI shows that pretreatment of non-stimulated sGC with high concentrations of ONOO− (≥0.1 mM) antagonized further activation of the enzyme by NO. Taking into account the short half-life (˜1 s) of ONOO− at physiological pH(18Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6716) Google Scholar), 2 min of preincubation should have resulted in virtually complete inactivation of ONOO−, excluding the possibility that the inhibitory effects were due to a reaction of ONOO− with free NO, as we have observed recently using a Clark-type electrode for NO detection.2 2K. Schmidt, P. Klatt, and B. Mayer, unpublished results. Reaction of ONOO− with GSH (1 mM each) was complete within 2 min and resulted in formation of a compound, which exhibited a light absorbance maximum at 338 nm and co-eluted with authentic GSNO from RP-18 columns in five different solvents. Fig. 4 shows that formation of GSNO was increased at increasing pH; half-maximal efficiency was observed at pH 7.0, maximal yields required pH values ≥ 8.5. The reaction was not inhibited in the presence of EDTA (not shown). If this non-enzymatic S-nitrosation of GSH was responsible for the cGMP accumulation induced by ONOO−, GSNO should decompose and release NO under certain conditions. We have investigated this issue by both spectrophotometric analysis of authentic GSNO and electrochemical measurement of NO release. As revealed by recording the absorbance at 338 nm over time, GSNO was stable for at least 5 h at pH 2.0-9.0. However, presence of 1 mM GSH induced a time-dependent, EDTA-sensitive decomposition of the nitrosothiol (t ˜3 h at pH 7.5; not shown). Decomposition of GSNO was accompanied by release of NO as revealed by the electrochemical measurements shown in Fig. 5. GSNO (50 μM) alone induced a very slight transient response of a Clark-type NO electrode, corresponding to apparent NO concentrations of less than 20 nM, whereas a pronounced, long-lasting release of NO was observed upon addition of 50 μM GSH. GSH-induced NO release was markedly enhanced in the presence of 10 μM CuCl2 and completely blocked by 10 mM EDTA. The initial rates of NO release shown in Fig. 5 were 0.46 and 2.00 μM min-1 in the absence and presence of added CuCl2, respectively, steady state concentrations of NO were reached about 2 min after addition of GSH. GSH-induced release of NO from GSNO was further confirmed in experiments with purified sGC. Fig. 6 shows that GSNO stimulated the formation of cGMP in a concentration-dependent manner. Maximal sGC activities of about 1 μmol of cGMP × mg-1× min-1 were observed with 0.3 mM GSNO, the EC50 of the nitrosothiol was 8.0 μM. In the presence of 2 mM GSH, the EC50 of GSNO was 0.18 μM and maximal effects were obtained at GSNO concentrations as low as 1 μM, further suggesting that GSH triggers release of NO from the nitrosothiol. Previous reports have demonstrated that ONOO− exhibits NO-like biologic activities, inducing relaxation of blood vessels (28Liu S. Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1114-1121PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu M.D. Pritchard K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The present study strongly suggests that these effects of ONOO− may be mediated by thiol-dependent stimulation of sGC. Authentic ONOO− induced a pronounced accumulation of endothelial cGMP levels with a maximal effect comparable to that of the NO donor DEA/NO. Consistent with rather long diffusion distances, presumably resulting in significant decomposition of the added ONOO−(18Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6716) Google Scholar), accumulation of cellular cGMP required about 10-fold higher concentrations of ONOO− (EC50˜ 0.2 mM) than stimulation of purified soluble guanylyl cyclase (EC50˜ 0.02 mM; see below). The effect of ONOO− on endothelial cGMP accumulation was significantly attenuated by depletion of intracellular GSH with the thiol-depleting agents CDNB and DEM, indicating that GSH is an important cellular target mediating the biologic activity of ONOO−. However, the effects of the drugs were incomplete, and at higher concentrations these agents were toxic to the cells (not shown). Thus, the residual GSH (approximately 1-2 mM) could be sufficient to support GSNO formation or, alternatively, additional targets may be involved in ONOO− action. Free sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins, for instance, could react with ONOO− to yield comparably stable S-nitroso derivatives that slowly release NO(45Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A.

Lack of effect of CDNB and DEM on cGMP accumulation induced by DEA/NO is in accordance with previous findings showing that the effects of several NO donors were not significantly affected by pretreatment of endothelial cells with thiol-depleting drugs(39Ghigo D.

Speyer J.F. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

So far, eight examples of RNA editing that result in alteration of an adenosine residue to guanosine detected by cDNA sequencing have been reported (10Köhler M. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1993; 10: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 11Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J.R.P. Kuner T. Monyer H. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H.

These channels respond to L-glutamate, a major neurotransmitter, and mediate fast excitatory synaptic responses(13Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). All of the amino acid changes introduced by the RNA editing have a large physiological impact on ion conductance, calcium permeability, and the kinetics of desensitization of the edited glutamate receptor (GluR) channels(10Köhler M.

In one example, an arginine residue (CGG or CIG), located in the second transmembrane region of both α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) GluR-B subunit and also a subpopulation of kainate receptor GluR-5 and −6 subunits, were generated through an RNA editing process. In this case, an RNA editing event specifically changes the geneencoded glutamine codon (CAG) by modification of adenosine to guanosine(12Sommer B. Köhler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). The formation of a short dsRNA structure between the exonic sequence around the editing site and the downstream intron sequence, as well as dsRNA formed between inverted repeat structures in the intron, are essential for RNA editing of these GluR-B transcripts(17Egerbjerg J. Kukekov V. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, additional adenosines are converted to guanosines in the intron, and at the third base of another glutamine codon within the dsRNA structure of GluR-B transcripts(17Egerbjerg J. Kukekov V. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

These two features, a requirement for dsRNA formation and multiple adenosine modifications are the hallmark of DRADA. Finally, the presence of an inosine residue in the edited GluR-B RNA at the Q/R site was directly demonstrated recently, confirming that the A to G conversion detected by cDNA sequencing is indeed derived from the A to I change of the RNA(19Yang J.-H.

The accumulated evidence strongly suggests that DRADA is involved in this particular RNA editing process in mammalian brain (17Egerbjerg J. Kukekov V. Heinemann S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study, we have carried out deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the dsRNA binding domains, and also other amino acid residues that we postulate to be involved in zinc coordination and formation of the catalytic center of DRADA. Our results suggest that the three repeats of the DRBMs are not functionally equivalent to each other, though their amino acid sequences are well conserved. The first and third DRBM seem more important for the DRADA activity, while the second DRBM can be removed without affecting the enzymatic activity. Since the deletion of any one DRBM did not significantly change the Kd of mutant DRADA proteins for substrate dsRNAs, DRBM1 and DRBM3 may participate in the catalytic mechanism in addition to RNA binding. We identified four amino acid residues essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity. The residues His910 and Cys966, as previously predicted(22Laskey R.A. Dingwall G. Cell. 1993; 74: 585-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), as well as an additional cysteine residue, Cys1036, may be involved in zinc chelation. The residue Glu912 is also found to be indispensable, confirming its possible role in the proton transfer reactions that occur during catalysis by DRADA.

For preparation of ΔC1, 2, 3, and 4, the wild-type plasmid was subjected to deletion mutagenesis around the putative C-terminal deaminase catalytic domain (amino acids 835-1221) using ExoIII exonuclease (33Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) after cleavage at the StuI site located near the C-terminal end. The linearized DNA was incubated with ExoIII nuclease (New England Biolabs Inc.) for various times in order to generate nested deletions. The reaction products were then treated with mung bean nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) to trim the ends of the ExoIII-treated plasmid DNAs. Inserts with various sizes of deletions were released by restriction digestion at the SstI site located between two DRBMs. The digestion products were fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the purified fragments were subcloned back into the SstI and StuI sites of the wild-type plasmid. The resultant C-terminal deletion clones were sequenced through the junction sites, using the 373A DNA sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The DNA sequences obtained were analyzed by the BESTFIT program of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (GCG) sequence analysis software (version 7.0)(34Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Only in-frame deletions were selected for further experiments. DRBM deletion mutants and also point mutations of the catalytic domain were constructed by using the commercially available Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with some modifications. The system requires a restriction site unique for the plasmid to be used for designing of a selection oligo. The StuI site located 75 bp upstream of the stop codon was chosen as a selection site. The selection oligo, StuIm, carries a single base substitution that will eliminate the StuI site without changing any amino acid residue. Both selection oligo and mutagenic oligo were phosphorylated using T4 DNA polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The plasmid pVL-DRADA140 (0.1 μg) denaturated by 0.2 N NaOH was mixed with 0.1 μg of selection oligo StuIm and 0.1 μg of a mutagenic oligo in a total volume of 20 μl annealing buffer (Clontech), heated at 100°C for 3 min, and cooled on ice. The mutant strand was synthesized by incubating the reaction mixture with T4 DNA polymerase (Clontech) and T4 DNA ligase (Clontech) at 37°C for 2 h. The wild-type plasmid DNA was linearized by StuI, while the hybrid of wild-type strand and newly synthesized mutant strand remained uncut. The restriction digestion products were transformed into Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 mutS strain (Clontech). The transformants were suspended in 500 μl of Luria Broth (LB) medium (Bio101), and 20 μl of the cell suspension were inoculated into 1.5 ml of LB containing ampicillin 100 μg/ml, and cultured at 37°C for 6 h. The plasmid pool was isolated by a quick alkaline method (33Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and digested with StuI, once again to linearize the wild-type plasmid. The digestion product was then transformed into E. coli DH5α, and 10 clones each of the resultant transformants were screened for the absence of the StuI site. The candidate mutant clones were sequenced using Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to verify the mutation site. All point mutation constructs were designated as C909-S, H910-Y, E912-A, H958-Y, C966-S, C1036-S, and A1051-T in accordance with the names of the mutagenic oligonucleotide. All single DRBM (amino acids 502-798) deletions, ΔM1, ΔM2, and ΔM3, were achieved as described above using the same kit and selection oligo. The mutagenic oligos were designed in such a way that each has 15-20 bases of homology to both flanking sequences of the deletion. The precise deletions were confirmed by sequencing. Double DRBM deletion mutants ΔM1M3 and ΔM2M3 were reconstructed from single deletion mutants using a unique restriction site AflII located near the NH2-terminal and SstI located between DRBM2 and DRBM3. The AflII-SstI fragments of ΔM1 and ΔM2 were subcloned into ΔM3 at AflII and SstI sites, respectively, resulting in double DRBM deletions of ΔM1M3 and ΔM2M3. pVL-F-DRADA140 carrying an additional FLAG epitope-tag (35Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Prive V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Ceretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar) at the NH2-terminal of the full-length DRADA wild-type protein was constructed as follows: the entire coding region of DRADA was amplified using a plasmid pVL-DRADA140 (21Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and a set of PCR primers FLAGUP and FLAGDW. This PCR procedure created a methionine residue followed by the polypeptide sequence, Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys (FLAG epitope-tag), at the 5′ of the NH2-terminal of the authentic DRADA140 protein. In addition, it also removed the GC-rich 5′-untranslated region and long 3′-untranslated region, and created a new Kozak (36Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) sequence that is strongly preferred by baculovirus for protein translation initiation (37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Lucklow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman & Co., Oxford, UK1992Google Scholar) at the new NH2-terminal region. The PCR products were digested with NotI and XbaI, and the 3.9 kb NotI/XbaI DNA fragment was gel purified, and then ligated into NotI and XbaI sites of pVL1392 vector (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA). DRBM deletions with FLAG epitope, pVL-F-ΔM1, pVL-F-ΔM2, and pVL-F-ΔM3 plasmids, were prepared by excising the AflII-XbaI fragments (3.7 kb) containing deletions from the original mutant constructs and ligating them into the AflII and XbaI sites of pVL-F-DRADA140. A point mutation with FLAG epitope, pVL-F-E912-A, was created in the same way as other point mutations except that pVL-F-DRADA140 was used as a starting plasmid. The DRADA proteins containing the FLAG epitope-tag prepared from these constructs were purified by a monoclonal antibody M2 affinity column chromatography (Kodak). Spodoptera frugiperdera (Sf9) cells were obtained from The Wistar Institute Expression Core Facility. The insect medium TMN-FH with 10% fetal bovine serum was purchased from Pharmingen, and supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic-F68 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.). To obtain recombinant baculovirus expressing human DRADA proteins, 2 × 106 Sf9 cells were co-transfected with a mixture of 3 μg of recombinant plasmid and 2.5 μg of BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA following the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). The transfected cells were incubated at 27°C for 5 days. Primary recombinant viruses collected as supernatant of the culture were then reamplified by infecting 1 × 107 Sf9 cells with 500 μl of primary recombinant virus stocks. Amplified viruses were collected after 3 days of incubation at 27°C. Approximately 1 × 107 Sf9 cells were infected with 500 μl of amplified recombinant virus, incubated at 27°C for 48 h. The infected cells were collected and pelleted by centrifugation. The infected cells were washed once with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without CaCl2 or MgCl2 and 1 ml of TEN (0.15 M NaCl, 40 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 × proteinase inhibitor mix), then resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM DTT and 1 × proteinase inhibitor mix. Following sonication, the cell debris was pelleted at 4°C by centrifugation. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of buffer containing 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 40% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, and 2 × proteinase inhibitor mix. The proteinase inhibitor mix (500×) was made with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 M), pepstatin (1.5 mM), leupeptin (4.2 mM), and aprotinin (0.3 mM). For each construct, three to six independent infections and cell extract preparations were carried out in order to obtain a reliable quantitative estimate for the mutated DRADA enzyme activity. The production of recombinant DRADA protein was assessed by [35S]methionine labeling of infected cells(37O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Lucklow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman & Co., Oxford, UK1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (2 × 106) were infected with 500 μl of each amplified recombinant virus stock at multiplicity of 10-20 for 46 h. The infected cells were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of methionine-free Grace's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Following incubation at 27°C for 1 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh methionine-free medium containing 40 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) and incubated for another 1 h. The cells were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline three times. The labeled protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (8%) and fluorography. The recombinant DRADA proteins, F-DRADA140, F-DRADAΔM1, F-DRADAΔM2, F-DRADAΔM3, and F-DRADAE912-A containing a FLAG epitope-tag were purified on an anti-FLAG M2 immunoaffinity gel column. Approximately 20 mg of crude extract protein made from Sf9 cells infected with various recombinant baculoviruses were applied to 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Eastman) equilibrated with buffer A (0.05 M Tris, pH 7.0, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mM of β-mercaptoethonol plus 0.15 M NaCl). The flow-through fraction was applied two more times to the same column to increase the binding efficiency of the recombinant protein. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl, then with 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.75 M NaCl and once again with 30 ml of buffer A containing 0.15 M NaCl. The recombinant DRADA protein was extracted with 6 ml of buffer A containing 75 μg/ml of FLAG peptide. The eluted proteins were pooled and concentrated by Centricon 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and stored at −70°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent or the integrated separation systems protein-gold assay system with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purified proteins were analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (4% acrylamide stacking gel, 8% acrylamide resolving gel)(38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by silver staining(39Bürk R.R. Eschenbruch M. Leuthard P. Steck G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DRADA enzymatic activity was assayed in vitro(4Wagner R.W. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 40Kim U. Garner T.L. Sanford T. Speicher D.

Unless specified otherwise, the reaction was carried out in 100 μl, which contained 10 fmol of [α-32P]ATP-labeled c-myc dsRNA, 0.05 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and various amounts of cell extract or purified proteins. After incubation at 37°C, the reaction products were deproteinized and then precipitated with ethanol as described previously. The DRADA reaction products were digested with nuclease P1 into 5′-mononucleotides and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC. The solvent system used was 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, ammonium sulfate, 1-propanol, 100:60:2 (v/w/v), as described previously(41SilverKlang M. Gillum A.M. Rahbhandary U.L. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 91: 247-254Google Scholar). The radioactivity of the adenosine and inosine spots on TLC plates was quantified by a PhosphorImaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A filter-binding assay (42Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Newby R. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 34: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was carried out by using recombinant DRADA proteins containing the FLAG epitope-tag at their NH2-terminal and [α-32P]ATP-labeled c-myc dsRNA (575 bp), or c-myc antisense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (605 nucleotides)(4Wagner R.W. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture, kept on ice, contained 10 ng of DRADA and varying quantities of dsRNA or ssRNA (0.05-5 nM) in 100 μl of the DRADA assay buffer containing 0.05 M Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 5 μg/ml E. coli tRNA, and 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37°C and immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (25 mm and 0.45 μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA) on a manifold filtration apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell) at a slow flow rate. The membranes were subsequently washed five times with 0.5 ml each of the ice-cold DRADA assay buffer, dried, and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. We aligned the human DRADA sequence with other known deaminases and with a recently identified nematode gene, T20H4.4(43Wilson R. Ainscough R. Anderson K. Baynes C. Berks M. Bonfield J. Burton J.

Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We found that several short stretches of contiguous amino acid residues, including two tripeptide sequences HAE and PCG located in the C-terminal region, are highly conserved (Fig. 1). We believe these conserved amino acid residues are directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of DRADA(21Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Among these residues, of special interest are the amino acids histidine and cysteine, which can participate in coordination of a zinc atom and formation of a catalytic center, as was predicted by examination of the three-dimensional structure of adenosine deaminase (44Wilson D.K.F. Rudolph B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 250: 1278-1284Crossref Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and cytidine deaminase(45Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter Jr., C.W. J. Mol.

Here we identify the amino acid residues within NCAM that are polysialylated and structural domains of the NCAM polypeptide that are required for addition of PSA in cells. Chicken NCAM cDNAs containing amino acid mutations, domain deletions, and domain substitutions were expressed in the F11 rat/mouse hybrid cell line, which can produce polysialylated NCAM. Polysialylation of the chicken NCAM was evaluated by immunopurification and electrophoresis. Mutation of all three potential N-glycosylation sites within the fifth immunoglobulin domain (Ig5) abrogated polysialylation. Analysis of paired mutations revealed that Asn-459 is heavily polysialylated, Asn-430 has a lower level of substitution, and Asn-404 receives little or no PSA. Analysis of domain deletions established that the intracellular domain, Ig domains 1-3, and the COOH-terminal fibronectin-type III (FNIII) repeat are not required for polysialylation, but that deletion of either the adjacent Ig4 or FNIII-type domain prevented addition of PSA. Accordingly, a minimal polypeptide for polysialylation was found to contain Ig domains 4 and 5, the adjacent FNIII repeat, plus a membrane attachment. These results suggest that although all PSA is located within Ig5, regions outside Ig5 also play a role in PSA addition to NCAM. Furthermore, molecular modeling indicates spatial proximity of Asn-430 and Asn-459 and a tight-locking arrangement between Ig4, Ig5, and FNIII#1 that would be consistent with their formation of a spatially discrete enzyme recognition site for polysialylation.

https://openalex.org/W2012859837,"Several subspecies of human high density lipoprotein (HDL) have been shown to exist, and particle size is one parameter that can be used to distinguish them. Recently, a small HDL subspecies has been described that may be a particularly efficient acceptor of peripheral cell unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC). To address the effects of particle size on the ability of HDL to remove FC from cells, homogeneous, well defined HDL particles were reconstituted (rHDL) that varied in particle diameter within the size range of human HDL particles (7-13 nm). The abilities of each of these particles to remove cellular FC from mouse L-cells and rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells were compared on the basis of their phospholipid (PL) content as well as on a per particle basis. The effect of particle size was also examined using small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) of 25 nm in diameter and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 70-180 nm in diameter. The SUV were prepared by sonication, and the LUVs were prepared by extrusion techniques. The FC efflux efficiency of these particles (in order of decreasing efficiency) was: rHDL > SUV > LUV when compared on the basis of acceptor PL content across a range of concentrations (i.e. at a given PL concentration for these three acceptor classes, smaller particles were more efficient). The FC efflux differences between the rHDL and the vesicles were not due to the absence of apolipoprotein in the vesicles. No difference was detected among the rHDL of varying size, nor was a difference detected among the LUVs of varying size when compared on the basis of PL content. When the FC efflux data for rHDL and LUVs were normalized on the basis of the number of acceptor particles present at a given PL concentration, a correlation was found between acceptor particle radius and the ability to accept cellular FC with larger particles being the most efficient. However, the dependence of the rate of FC efflux on acceptor particle size was not quantitatively the same within the rHDL and LUV classes of acceptor particles. The dependence of FC efflux on acceptor particle size may reflect differing abilities of the variously sized acceptor particles to access the region very close to the cell plasma membrane where most of the FC removal is expected to occur.

Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). HDL subspecies have been characterized according to a variety of physical properties including apolipoprotein composition (6Cheung M.C. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12201-12209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), charge characteristics(7Marcel Y.L. Weech P.K. Nguyen T. Milne R.W. McConathy W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and particle size(8Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 476-482Crossref Scopus (6460) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are the studies of Fielding et al.(9Castro G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 10Francone O.L. Fielding C.J. Eur. Heart J. 1990; 11 (Suppl. E–): 218-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which have demonstrated that a minor charge subspecies of human HDL may be a particularly important factor in the first step of reverse cholesterol transport, the removal of cellular unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) from cells. One characteristic of this particle is its small size (70 kDa) (9Castro G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) with respect to the bulk of human plasma HDL (180-390 kDa) (11Skipski K.P. Nelson G.J. Blood Lipids and Lipoproteins: Quantitation, Composition, and Metabolism. Wiley Interscience, New York1972: 471-583Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the size of an HDL particle may be an important mediator of reverse cholesterol transport because smaller particles are expected to more freely infiltrate the interstitial space, the site of the majority of peripheral cell FC removal(12Reichl D. European Heart J. 1990; 11 (Supplement E–): 230-236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, the effect of particle size on this function of HDL has not been studied in detail. Such studies of HDL size subspecies have been hindered by the high degree of structural and compositional heterogeneity that is inherent in even highly purified preparations from human plasma.To study the effect of HDL structure on the ability to remove cellular FC, we have taken the approach of reconstituting well defined HDL particles (rHDL) that are homogeneous in composition and structure and testing their abilities to remove cultured cell FC. We have previously studied the role of HDL apolipoprotein structure (13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phospholipid composition (14Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) on the ability of the particles to remove cellular FC. The current study focuses on the effect of HDL particle size on this function. A previous study by Agnani and Marcel (15Agnani G. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) took a similar approach to this problem. In that work, phosphatidylcholine-containing rHDL particles of increasing size that contained 2, 3, and 4 molecules of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) were used in cultured cell FC efflux experiments. The authors concluded that the larger rHDL were the most effective FC acceptors and that the FC efflux to these particles could be correlated to the particle diameter, the number of apoAI molecules per particle, and the apoAI:phospholipid ratio. However, all of these parameters are interrelated, and the important characteristic among them could not be distinguished because the rHDL contained different amounts of apoAI per particle and different PL:apoAI ratios. A different conclusion about the effect of rHDL size on FC efflux was reported by Jonas et al.(16Jonas A. Bottum K. Theret N. Duchateau P. Castro G. J.

They concluded that smaller rHDL particles were more efficient acceptors of cell-derived and lipoprotein-derived FC than larger particles. However, this conclusion was reached when the data (initially based on apoAI content) were postexperimentally normalized to the phospholipid content of the acceptor particles. Since the dependence of FC efflux on the phospholipid content of HDL is not a linear relationship(13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 14099-14106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), such an analysis is not straightforward and can lead to misleading results. Close inspection of the data reveals that the FC efflux promoted by the various particles in this study correlated to the amount of PL contained in the particle, in agreement with Agnani and Marcel(15Agnani G. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2643-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The objective in the current study was to test the hypothesis that the size of a FC acceptor particle can affect its ability to remove FC from cells. Since the size of a rHDL particle is related to its PL:apoAI ratio, it is important to understand the dependence of FC efflux to rHDL in terms of both the phospholipid concentration and the number of particles present in a FC efflux incubation. This can be done by preparing differently sized rHDL particles that contain the same number of molecules of apoAI per particle and comparing their abilities to remove cell FC when they are added to the extracellular medium at equal phospholipid concentrations. This allows a straightforward normalization of the FC efflux to the acceptor PL content, and the FC efflux can then be expressed in terms of the number of particles present at a given phospholipid concentration. FC efflux experiments of this type were performed with four highly homogeneous, well characterized rHDL that varied in particle diameter across the size range of human plasma HDL (7.3-12.8 nm). The smallest three of these particles contained two molecules of apoAI, with the largest containing three molecules. In addition, the ability of unilamellar vesicles ranging in diameter from 25 to 180 nm in diameter to remove FC was also assessed. The results indicate that, among rHDL, larger particles are more effective than smaller particles when compared on a per particle basis. A similar relationship was found for the large unilamellar vesicles although the vesicles were less efficient acceptors than rHDL. This effect was not due to the absence of apolipoproteins in the unilamellar vesicles, because vesicles that contained adsorbed apoAI were not able to remove more cellular FC than unmodified vesicles. The results from this study suggest that the dependence of FC efflux on acceptor particle size may reflect differing abilities of the variously sized acceptor particles to access the region very close to the cell plasma membrane where most of the FC removal is expected to occur.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSodium cholate and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. 1-Palmitoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) (+99% grade). [1,2-3H]cholesterol was obtained from DuPont NEN. Minimal essential medium and bovine calf and fetal serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml of gentamicin (Sigma). All other reagents were analytical grade.Methods Purification of Human ApolipoproteinsHuman HDL was isolated from the fresh plasma of normolipidemic subjects by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously(18Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HDL was delipidated (apoHDL) in ethanol:diethyl ether as described by Scanu and Edelstein (19Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and purified apoAI was isolated by anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose (20Weisweiler P. Friedl C. Ungar M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1987; 169: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and stored in lyophilized form at −70°C. Prior to use, apoAI was resolubilized in 6 M guanidine HCl and dialyzed extensively against standard Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 8.2).Preparation and Characterization of Discoidal Reconstituted HDL ParticlesAll discoidal particles were reconstituted using the sodium cholate removal method described in detail elsewhere (21Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the starting PL to protein stoichiometries shown in Table 1. Intact rHDL were separated from unreacted lipid and protein by gel filtration chromatography on a (2.5 × 100 cm) Superose 6 column eluted with Tris buffer (0.7 ml/min at 25°C). The homogeneity and hydrodynamic diameters of rHDL particles were estimated by Phast native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis using precast, 8-25% gradient gels (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)(21Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The particle migrations were determined to within 0.1 mm by digitizing the gel with a Mustek 105 scanner followed by computer image analysis (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Intact rHDL particles were chemically analyzed using the Markwell modification of the Lowry protein assay(22Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar), while PL were determined as inorganic phosphorus by the method of Sokoloff and Rothblat(23Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The number of protein molecules per particle was determined by cross-linking the apoAI with dimethyl suberimidate(24Swaney J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobilities of native and reconstituted HDL were measured on Beckman Paragon preformed 0.5% agarose gels, and the potential at the particle surface of shear (surface potential, S) was calculated as described by Sparks and Phillips(25Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The average percentage of α-helix content was determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy on a Jasco J41A spectropolarimeter at 25°C in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. The percent α-helix was determined from the molar ellipticities at 222 nm(21Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Tabel 1 Open table in a new tab Preparation and Characterization of PL Unilamellar VesiclesPOPC small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) with estimated diameters of 25 ± 5 nm were made using the sonication technique of Barenholz et al.(26Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The SUV that had been reisolated by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm in a 50-Ti rotor for 2 h at 25°C appeared homogeneous by gel filtration chromatography. SUV preparations in Tris buffer were mixed with apoAI to make SUV with adsorbed apoAI (SUV-apoAI) as described by Yokoyama et al.(27Yokoyama S. Fukushima D. Kupferberg J.P. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7333-7339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial preparation contained SUV and apoAI at a 170:1 mol POPC:mol apoAI ratio, and this mixture was incubated for 16 h at 25°C. Using gel filtration chromatography, SUV-apoAI fractions that were similar in size to protein-free SUV (25 nm) were combined and concentrated. Analysis of the PL and protein content of four independent preparations resulted in SUV-apoAI that contained 4-5 molecules of apoAI per SUV. The isolated SUV-apoAI appeared to be stable for at least 3 days at 4°C; no lipid-free apoAI was detectable by gel filtration chromatography during this period (data not shown). LUVs were prepared by the extrusion technique of Hope et al.(28Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2002) Google Scholar). Briefly, POPC multilamellar liposomes were placed into an extrusion device (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, B.C.), which passed the mixture through polycarbonate filters of varying pore size under pressures of 100-500 lb/in2. The resulting LUVs were classified according to the pore size of the filter through which they were passed (for example, LUV50s were created by passage through a 50-nm filter). The characteristics of the LUVs made with 50-, 100-, and 200-nm filters are shown in Table 2.Tabel 2 Open table in a new tab Efflux of Plasma Membrane CholesterolMouse L-cell fibroblast or rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells were used to monitor the FC efflux efficiencies of the various vesicles and rHDL. The methods for the efflux assay as well as the postexperiment work-up were as previously reported (13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. The L-cells were plated 6 days prior to the experiment in 12-well cell plates (22 mm) at 75-100 × 103 cells/well. 1.0-1.5 μCi/well [3H]FC in bicarbonate-buffered minimal essential medium with 3% fetal calf serum was used for the cell-labeling procedure. After a brief wash, the efflux measurements were initiated by the application of 1.0 ml/well of the test medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and the rHDL complex at the appropriate concentration. Typical cell protein values were between 250 and 300 μg of protein/well. Efflux experiments that used rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells were done exactly the same as the L-cell efflux experiments except that only 0.5-1.0 μCi of labeled FC was used to label the cells.Data AnalysisThe fractional release of cellular FC determined experimentally was analyzed as described in detail for these systems previously(13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinetic analysis assumes a closed system in which FC exists in one of two kinetic pools, either the cellular FC pool or the acceptor FC pool. The equilibration of FC between these pools is fit to the single exponential equation Y = H1e−gt+ H2 (see (5Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) for a detailed description of this equation), which has been shown to fit the data better than a double exponential equation by comparison of the F statistic (13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Y represents the fraction of radiolabeled FC remaining in the cells, t is the incubation time in h, H1 is a preexponential term that reflects the fraction of cellular FC that exists in the medium at equilibrium, g is the sum of the rate constants for efflux (ke) and influx (ki), and H2 is a constant that represents the fraction of labeled cell FC that remains associated with the cells at equilibrium due to a constant retrograde flux of FC from the extracellular acceptor to the cell. H1, g, and H2 are variables that can be fit to the experimental data by computer (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). The apparent rate constant for the efflux process (ke) is the product of H1 and g. This value should be considered “apparent” because it is dependent on acceptor particle concentration under some conditions. The apparent t1/2value in hours is then calculated as follows: t1/2 = ln 2/ke.RESULTSFC Efflux to Discoidal rHDL Particles Compared on the Basis of PL ConcentrationTo determine the effect of particle size on FC efflux within the size range of human HDL particles, homogeneous, discoidal rHDL that varied in size from 7 to 13 nm in diameter were reconstituted with apoAI and POPC. Table 1 shows clear increases in the particle hydrodynamic diameter as the rHDL phospholipid to protein ratio was increased. All rHDL contained 2 molecules of apoAI except for the 12.8-nm particle, which contained 2 or 3 molecules. The particles appeared homogeneous on native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis after reisolation by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). All rHDL exhibited surface potential values in the pre-β migration range according to the classification scheme proposed by Sparks and Phillips (−7.0 to −10.5 mV)(25Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 123-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the α-helix content of the associated apoAI molecules increased with the increasing PL:apoAI ratio in agreement with previous studies in this laboratory (refer to (21Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for a detailed discussion of the effects of PL:apoAI ratio on the structure of rHDL particles). These data show that the conformation of apoAI changes in response to increases in the PL content of rHDL particles.The ability of these particles to remove tritiated FC from mouse L-cells was determined. Previous studies demonstrated that decreases in cellular FC mass closely paralleled decreases in cellular FC radioactivity upon exposure to acceptor-containing medium, indicating that the radiolabel correctly reflected movement of FC mass(13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the PL concentration of the extracellular medium has been shown to be constant over the 6-h time course for apoAI/POPC rHDL particles, indicating that the particles did not precipitate out of solution during the experiment(14Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography of test medium recovered after an efflux incubation showed that the FC radioactivity appearing in the medium eluted at a volume that was characteristic of the discoidal rHDL particle that was present initially in the medium(14Davidson W.S. Gillotte K.L. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5882-5890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This indicated the following: (a) the acceptor particles sequestered cellular FC, and (b) the acceptor particles did not significantly change size during the efflux assay (i.e. there was no fusion or aggregation of rHDL). Fig. 1 shows the fraction of cellular FC remaining in the cell over a 6-h FC efflux incubation with each of the four rHDL particles present at 50 μg/ml of PL. The t1/2values for the 7.3-, 9.3-, 10.0-, and 12.8-nm rHDL were 12.6 ± 1.3, 12.0 ± 2.0, 12.5 ± 1.6 and 13.5 ± 2.2 h, respectively, indicating that the FC efflux to each of these complexes was similar despite the differences in PL:apoAI ratio and apoAI conformation. To determine the dependence of FC efflux on acceptor particle concentration, the FC efflux rate constants were measured for each particle over a range of 10-200 μg of POPC/ml (Fig. 2). No significant differences were detectable at low or high acceptor particle concentrations. Analysis of the kinetic data provides information about the predicted equilibrium distribution of FC between the cell and acceptor pools. At low rHDL concentrations (10 μg of PL/ml) the distribution was similar for all four rHDL with 7-10% of cell FC present in the acceptor pool at equilibrium. At 200 μg of PL/ml this increased to 75-80% of cellular FC in the medium (data not shown). To estimate the maximal FC efflux rate that can be attained by these particles, the initial rates of cellular FC efflux were plotted as a function of particle concentration as proposed by Hofstee(29Christensen H.N. Palmer G.A. Enzyme Kinetics. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1974: 50-60Google Scholar). This linearizes the data so that a maximal velocity (Vmax) can be estimated by extrapolating the data to the condition of infinitely high acceptor concentration(13Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22975-22982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Davidson W.S.

It should be noted that the Vmax values as expressed below in percentage of FC released per h are actually the maximum ke. However, in the experiments reported in this study, all of the cell FC behaved as a single kinetic pool for efflux. Thus, if the cell concentration of FC is taken as unity throughout, then Vmax equals the maximum ke. The actual Vmax can be obtained by multiplying the maximal ke by the FC mass contained in the cells at the initiation of the experiment (e.g. at 40 μg of FC/mg of cell protein a Vmax value of 10%/h corresponds to a mass release of 4 μg of FC/h). All rHDL particles exhibited a similar Vmax of 10-11% of cell FC released/h. A similar independence of FC efflux on rHDL particle size was found in experiments using rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells as the FC donors (data not shown). These results indicate that, when compared on the basis of PL content, no difference in FC efflux is observed between rHDL of varying PL:apoAI ratio.Figure 2:The concentration dependence of the rate for cholesterol efflux from mouse L-cell fibroblasts to apoAI•POPC complexes of increasing particle hydrodynamic diameter. The incubation conditions were the same as those for Fig. 1 except that the acceptor concentration was varied as shown. The acceptor particles are the same as in Fig. 1 with the same symbols. Each point represents six cell wells, and the errorbars represent one S.D. The values shown are corrected for the FC efflux to control medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FC Efflux to Unilamellar Vesicles Compared on the Basis of PL ConcentrationTo further examine the effect of acceptor particle size on FC efflux efficiency, unilamellar vesicles of varying diameters (25-185 nm) were produced by sonication and extrusion techniques (Table 2). The abilities of these vesicles to accept cellular FC from L-cells and rat Fu5AH hepatoma cells were compared over a range of acceptor PL concentrations (Fig. 3). As for the rHDL, all of the unilamellar vesicles were shown by gel filtration chromatography to not significantly change size or precipitate out of solution during a 6-h FC efflux incubation (data not shown).

INTRODUCTIONSchistosomes are digenetic trematodes that infect approximately 200 million people worldwide. The parasite has a complex life cycle that involves a snail intermediate host as well as man. Larval parasites, called cercariae, develop in the snail, are released into freshwater, and penetrate the mammalian hosts' skin. Subsequently, the cercariae transform into schistosomula that eventually leave the skin and migrate through the lungs and liver to the intestinal blood vessels where they mate and lay eggs. In both mice and humans, the early infection is characterized by a delayed type hypersensitivity response that is switched to a predominantly humoral response at the beginning of egg deposition.Carbohydrates have been increasingly implicated in the immune response in schistosomiasis. Antibodies from infected mice and humans have been shown to react with saccharide epitopes, particularly those on the surface of the invading larva and the soluble egg antigens (28Simpson A.J.G. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 40-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; 9Dunne D. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One of the major carbohydrate-containing surface antigens is the glycocalyx (GCX)1 1The abbreviations used are: GCXglycocalyx preparation used in this workΔFuc etc.Δ indicates the presence of an unsaturated bond as a consequence of eliminating a moiety of MeOH from the permethyl derivatives, or AcOH from peracetyl derivativesABEEethyl p-aminobenzoateAcOHacetic acidCADcollision-activated dissociationFABfast atom bombardmentGCgas chromatographylacdiNAcN,N′-diacetyllactosediaminelacNAcN-acetyllactosamineLeXLewis XLeYLewis Y-OMemethoxy-MeOHmethanolMSmass spectrometrymAbmonoclonal antibodyTh-1helper T cells (subclass 1)TMStrimethylsilyl. which covers the entire surface of the cercariae and extends approximately 1 μm from it. The GCX is known to be an extremely potent immunogen and is recognized by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that are protective in passive transfer experiments (12Grzych J.M. Capron M. Bazin H. Capron A. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2739-2743PubMed Google Scholar; 13Harn D.A. Mitsuyama M. David J.R. J. Exp.

Parasitol. 1970; 56: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; 32Standen O.D. J. Helminthol. 1952; 26: 25-42Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and by mAb raised against egg antigens (Harn et al., 1984). Conversely, a mAb (128C3/3) prepared against cercarial glycoproteins associated with the GCX was shown to recognize an epitope present on both glycolipid and glycoprotein fractions of the egg antigens (40Weiss J.B. Strand M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1421-1429PubMed Google Scholar; 41Weiss J.B. Magnani J.L. Strand M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4275-4282PubMed Google Scholar; 5Dalton J.P. Lewis S.A. Aronstein W.S.

Monosaccharide inhibition studies indicated that this epitope contains L-fucose in a unique structure which is distinct from the Lewis X epitope (18Levery S.B. Weiss J.B. Salyan M.E. Roberts C.E.

The latter is present on the surface of the parasite, in the soluble materials released from the eggs, and in the gut-associated antigens excreted into the host circulation, as well as being a mammalian host epitope (16Ko A.I.

Preliminary reductive β-elimination experiments on GCX purified by lectin affinity chromatography indicated the presence of fucose-rich complex oligosaccharides O-linked via GalNAc (21Nanduri J.

We report here detailed structural analysis on O-glycans similarly released from Anguilla lectin-purified material and demonstrate that cercarial GCX contains a heterogeneous population of highly fucosylated oligosaccharides distinct from, but related to, the provisional structures of the egg glycolipids (Levery et al., 1992). In particular, we have defined unique multifucosylated nonreducing terminal sequences which may constitute the immunodominant epitopes that cross-react with mAbs against egg antigens.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasite Origin and Preparation of GCX O-GlycansSchistosoma mansoni (Puerto Rican strain)-infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails were obtained from Dr. Fred Lewis, Bethesda, MD, and Dr. Tag Mansour, Palo Alto, CA.

The preparation of GCX sample from frozen cercariae and its subsequent purification by Sepharose 2B-CL column chromatography followed by Anguilla anguilla lectin affinity chromatography were performed as described previously (43Xu X.

Typically, O-glycans were released from 1-mg aliquots (by carbohydrate content) of GCX by reductive elimination (1 M NaBH4 in 0.05 M NaOH at 45°C for 16 h) and desalted through a Dowex (50W-X 8(H)) column. Excess borates were then removed by co-evaporation with 10% acetic acid in methanol under a stream of nitrogen.Periodate Oxidation and Smith DegradationThe released O-glycans were incubated with 50 μl of 50 mM sodium m-periodate in 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at room temperature for 4 h in the dark. The reaction was then quenched with 2 μl of ethylene glycol and left at room temperature for a further 30 min. The oxidized glycans were lyophilized and then reduced with 10 mg/ml NaBH4 in 2 M NH4OH at room temperature for 2 h after which the reaction mixture was neutralized with a few drops of glacial acetic acid, desalted on a Dowex (50W X-8(H)) column and the borates removed by co-evaporation with 10% acetic acid in methanol under N2. The oxidized sample was permethylated directly for FAB-MS analysis. Alternatively, the sample was subjected to Smith degradation using 40 mM trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 20 min. After drying down under a stream of nitrogen, the partially degraded sample was eluted off a Bio-Gel P-2 column and pooled for sequential enzyme digestions/FAB-MS analysis.Sequential Exo-glycosidase Digestions-β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase (from bovine kidney, EC 3.2.1.52; Boehringer Mannheim): 0.2 unit in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium-citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, initially for 18 h and then for a further 18 h with another aliquot of fresh enzyme; β-galactosidase (from bovine testes, EC 3.2.1.23; Boehringer Mannheim): 10 milliunits in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium-citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.6, for 24 h; α-galactosidase (from green coffee bean, EC 3.2.1.22; Boehringer Mannheim): 0.5 unit in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium-citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, for 24 h; α-L-fucosidase (from bovine kidney, EC 3.2.1.51; Boehringer Mannheim): 0.2 unit in 200 μl of 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5-5.0, for 24 h. All enzyme digestions were incubated at 37°C and terminated by boiling for 3 min before lyophilization. For sequential enzyme digestions, an appropriate aliquot was taken after each digestion and permethylated for FAB-MS analysis.Release of Oligofucose Units and Subsequent Tagging with ABEEFuc1-3 pieces were released from GCX by incubating in 50 μl of 0.1 M aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at 80°C for 40 min. The reagents were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. For tagging with ABEE, the hydrolysate was redissolved in 10 μl of water, followed by addition of 80 μl of a reagent mixture containing 4 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride and 35 mg of ABEE in a solution of methanol (350 μl) andacetic acid (45 μl), and incubated for 60-90 min at 80°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of water, and excess ABEE was extracted into 5 × 1 ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer containing the tagged sample was then lyophilized, redissolved in methanol:water, 1:1 (v/v), loaded on to a reverse phase Sep-Pak C18174 cartridge (Waters), and eluted with an increasing step-gradient of acetonitrile (15, 35, 50, 75, and 100%) after initial washes with water. ABEE-tagged glycans were normally recovered in the 35% acetonitrile fraction.Chemical Derivatization for FAB-MS and GC-MS AnalysisPeracetylation was carried out using 100 μl of pyridine:acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) at 80°C for 2 h. Permethylation using the sodium hydroxide procedure was performed as described by 8Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar. For sugar analysis, TMS derivatives of methyl glycosides were prepared from methanolysates (1 M methanolic-HCl at 80°C for 16 h) of both intact GCX and the released O-glycans using the Tri-Sil174 Z derivatizing reagent (Pierce, 15 min at room temperature) after initial re-N-acetylation with 500 μl of methanol, 10 μl of pyridine, and 50 μl of acetic anhydride at room temperature for 15 min. The absolute configurations of glycosyl residues were determined by GC-MS analysis of the TMS derivatives of (R)-(-)- and (S)-(+)-2-butanol essentially as described by 10Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P.

Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for GC-MS linkage analysis according to 1Albersheim P. Nevins D.J. English P.D. Karr A. Carbohydr. Res. 1967; 5: 340-345Crossref Scopus (1508) Google Scholar.GC-MS AnalysisGC-MS analysis was carried out on a Fisons Instruments MD800 machine fitted with a DB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm internal diameter, J& Scientific). The TMS derivatives and the partially methylated alditol acetates were dissolved in hexanes prior to on-column injection at 65°C. For sugar analysis, the oven was held at 65°C for 1 min before increasing to 140°C at 25°C/min and then to 200°C at 5°C/min, and finally to 300°C at 10°C/min. For linkage analysis, the oven was held at 65°C for 1 min before being increased to 290°C at a rate of 8°C/min.FAB-MS AnalysisFAB-MS spectra were acquired using a ZAB-2SE FPD mass spectrometer fitted with a cesium ion gun operated at 20-25 kV. Data acquisition and processing were performed using the VG Analytical Opus174 software. The derivatized O-glycans were aliquoted in methanol and loaded in a 1-monothioglycerol matrix. CAD MS-MS collisionally activated decomposition spectra were recorded using a Fisons VG Analytical four sector ZAB-T mass spectrometer in the array detector mode. The array was calibrated using daughters of CsI clusters, and all experiments were carried out at 4-kV collision cell voltage (8-kV primary ion beam) using an argon gas pressure set to reduce the 12C(M + H)+ of a substance P standard to two thirds of the normal peak height prior to gas introduction. Spectra were recorded by FAB ionization of samples in a monothioglycerol matrix (cesium ion gun) and transmission of the 12C parent ion of interest from MS1 into the collision cell. Array daughter spectra produced from the B/E scan of MS2 were summed over the period of ionization of the sample.NMR Analysis1H-1H COSY spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 2900 Hz in each dimension, and a total of 2048 complex points in F2 and 512 complex points in F1. Prior to two-dimensional Fourier transformation, data were apodized with a sine-bell weighting function. Chemical shifts are referenced indirectly to acetone (δ = 2.225 at 27 degrees Celsius).RESULTSMonosaccharide Composition of GCXAfter separation from glycogen-like material, the Anguilla lectin affinity chromatography purified GCX was previously determined to consist mainly of carbohydrates containing predominantly fucose, galactose, galactosamine and glucosamine (Xu et al., 1994). Similar data were obtained from the studies reported herein; these same four sugars were consistently found to be the major constituents at a molar ratio of approximately 5:1:1:1 in all batches of GCX examined, as well as in the glycans released by reductive elimination. In addition, GalNAcitol was the only alditol detected in the latter, suggesting that the released glycans were originally O-linked to the protein backbone via a GalNAc residue at the reducing end. The absolute configurations of Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc were all shown to be D- while Fuc was shown to be in the L-configuration.Nonreducing Terminal Sequence of GCXThe unusual monosaccharide composition of the O-glycans from GCX implicates unique multifucosylated structures. Preliminary information pertaining to the structures of the multifucosylated epitopes was obtained by FAB-MS analysis of permethyl and peracetyl derivatives of reductively eliminated material. Although no molecular ions were afforded by either derivative when analyzed in the mass range below m/z 2000, numerous strong signals corresponding to A-type fragment ions of unusual composition were present throughout this mass range. For the peracetyl derivatives, the major ions observed correspond to Fuc1,2+ (m/z 273, 503), Fuc1,2HexNAc1+ (m/z 560, 790) and Fuc3,4,5HexNAc2+ (m/z 1307, 1537, 1767) (Fig. 1). Significantly, the presence of Fuc2+ indicates that some of the fucoses of GCX must be directly linked to one another. The strong signal at m/z 978 can be assigned to a β-cleavage ion of composition (OH)1Fuc3HexNAc1+. Bearing in mind the absence of Fuc3HexNAc1+ (m/z 1020), these data are consistent with the major nonreducing moiety being ((Fuc1,2)HexNAc)((Fuc3)HexNAc). Less abundant components having fewer fucoses on the second HexNAc also appear to be present.These conclusions were supported by data from the permethyl derivative (Fig. 2). Signals at m/z 434 and 608 correspond to Fuc1HexNAc1+ and Fuc2HexNAc1+, respectively, while an ion at m/z 331 is consistent with loss of methanol from a Fuc2+ A-type ion (Fig. 2A). The presence of a strong signal at m/z 228 (ΔHexNAc+) but not at m/z 260 (HexNAc+), m/z 402 (ΔFuc1HexNAc+) or m/z 576 (ΔFuc2HexNAc1+) is consistent with the (Fuc1,2) moiety being 3-linked to the terminal HexNAc (6Dell A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1987; 45: 19-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Collision-activated dissociation (CAD) on the m/z 608 ion in tandem MS/MS analysis yielded daughter ions at m/z 157 (ΔFuc1+), 189 (Fuc1+), 228 (ΔHexNAc+), and 331 (ΔFuc2+), thus firmly establishing the nonreducing terminal sequence as ±Fuc-Fuc-3HexNAc (data not shown). Signals corresponding to Fuc3,4,5HexNAc2+ were present at m/z 1027, 1201, and 1375, respectively, while fragment ions having an additional Hex-HexNAc moiety at the reducing end of this structure afforded signals at m/z 1476, 1650, and 1824, respectively, corresponding to Fuc3,4,5Hex1HexNAc2+ (Fig. 2A). Both m/z 608 (Fuc2HexNAc1+) and 1375 (Fuc5HexNAc2+) were obtained after CAD on the ion at m/z 1824 (data not shown). Taken together, the low mass fragment ion data from the permethyl and peracetyl derivatives defined the nonreducing terminal sequence of GCX as ((Fuc1,2)HexNAc)-((Fuc2,3)HexNAc)-(Hex-HexNAc)-. Since m/z 1824 is significantly more abundant than m/z 1650, which is in turn more abundant than m/z 1476, the major glycoforms carry the full complement of fucoses on the nonreducing HexNAc-HexNAc moiety, i.e. five in total. Heterogeneity in fucosylation is primarily associated with the nonreducing residue, as judged by the m/z 434:608 ratio. Above m/z 1824 (Fig. 2B), the next major A-type ions are m/z 2070 and 2244, corresponding to a Fuc1HexNAc1 increment from m/z 1650 and 1824, respectively. A further extension of Hex plus HexNAcitol at the reducing end of these fragments provides an explanation for the smallest (M + H)+ molecular ions which were observed at m/z 2568 and 2742, corresponding to Fuc5,6Hex2HexNAc4HexNAcitol. Incorporating the established partial sequence and taking into consideration that Gal and GalNAcitol were the only Hex and HexNAcitol found, the structures of the smallest O-glycans of GCX may thus be defined as ((Fuc1-2)HexNAc)-((Fuc2-3)HexNAc)-((Gal-HexNAc))-((Fuc0-1) HexNAc)-Gal-GalNAcitol with the major pair containing a total of 5 and 6 fucoses.Figure 2:FAB spectra of permethylated GCX O-glycans in the mass range m/z 200-2000 (A) and m/z 2000-6500 (B). The complex clusters of signals associated with the Fuc3,4,5HexNAc2+ fragment ions are a consequence of both undermethylation and multiple modes of glycosidic cleavages. Secondary cleavages of primary ions would yield, for example, ions at m/z 821 and 839 which correspond to ΔFuc2HexNAc2+ and (OH)1Fuc2HexNAc2+, respectively. Likewise, signals at m/z 1114, 1288, and 1462 corresponding to (OH)1Fuc1,2,3Hex1HexNAc3+ were probably derived from the primary ions Fuc3,4,5Hex1HexNAc3+. Above m/z 2000, five major (M + H)+ molecular ion clusters were observed, the compositions of which are assigned in Table 1. Other signals are assigned in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In an additional experiment, the GCX oligosaccharides were digested with α-fucosidase, permethylated, and analyzed by FAB-MS. This resulted in a significant reduction in intensity of the signals at m/z 434, m/z 1650 and m/z 2568 with a concomitant increase in m/z 260, 1476, and 2394, respectively (data not shown). The remainder of the spectrum below m/z 3000 was largely unaffected, indicating first, that the oligofucosyl residues are resistant to digestion in the intact oligosaccharide and second, that the fucosyl heterogeneity suggested by the molecular ion masses largely resides in the nonreducing moiety. Thus the most abundant short glycans have the structure ((Fuc1-2)HexNAc)-((Fuc3)HexNAc)-((Gal-HexNAc))-((Fuc1)HexNAc)-Gal-GalNAcitol.The high mass domain of Fig. 2B is characterized by a prominent A-type ion at m/z 3042 which is an increment of Fuc3HexHexNAc2 above m/z 1824 and by a series of molecular ion clusters continuing to at least m/z 6000 (Fig. 2B). Linkage analysis on the permethyl derivatives yielded predominantly t-Fucp, 2-Fucp, and an approximately equimolar amount of 3-Galp, 3-GalNAcp, and 3,4-GlcNAcp. Lesser amounts of 4GlcNAcp, 3,6-GalNAcitol, and 3-GalNAcitol were also detected, with the last two being present in approximately 2:1 ratio. Thus, although the smaller O-glycans from GCX are probably linked via a type 1 core (→Gal1→3GalNAcitol), the major portion of the glycan chains terminate with 3,6-GalNAcitol, and are thus likely to have a branched type 2 core (→Gal1→3(→GlcNAc1→6)GalNAcitol). The molecular ion clusters observed at masses in excess of 3000 Da (Fig. 2B) are consistent with this conclusion. To facilitate interpretation of these high mass data additional structural information from chemical and enzymatic degradations was sought (see below).In earlier work (Xu et al., 1994) automated hydrazinolysis methodology was used to release glycans from GCX which were then separated by electrophoresis after fluorescent tagging. Bands co-migrating with standards containing 11, 12, 16, and 17 sugar residues were detected. We now have FAB-MS evidence that suggests that these bands correspond to core type 1 glycans which lack the reducing GalNAc residue (data not shown). Thus it appears that highly complex structures of the type found in GCX are very susceptible to “peeling” under alkaline elimination conditions and hydrazinolysis procedures optimized for release of intact O-glycans from mammalian glycoproteins (24Patel T. Bruce J. Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jaques A. Parekh R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) should be used with caution on molecules like GCX.Periodate Oxidation Defines the Backbone of GCX O-GlycansFrom the linkage analysis data, it was predicted that the 3-Gal, 3-GalNAc, and 3,4-GlcNAc residues would be resistant to periodate oxidation, whereas the t-Fuc and 2-Fuc would not. This provided a simple way to defucosylate without cleaving other residues. The periodate oxidized GCX O-glycans were permethylated and analyzed directly by FAB-MS. In the low mass region (Fig. 3A), the three dominant A-type ions at m/z 260, 505, and 954 correspond, respectively, to HexNAc1+, HexNAc2+, and Hex1HexNAc3+ which are consistent with defucosylated counterparts of the major A-type ions in Fig. 2A. Importantly, the presence of HexNAc-HexNAc+ after defucosylation rules out an alternative structure having the fucoses in chain, in between the two HexNAcs. CAD on the ion at m/z 954 yielded strong A-type ions at m/z 260 (HexNAc1+), m/z 473 (ΔHexNAc2+), m/z 505 (HexNAc2+) and m/z 709 (HexNac2Hex1+), as well as ring cleavage daughter ions at m/z 274 (HCO-HexNAc1+), m/z 478 (HCO-Hex1HexNAc1+), and m/z 723 (HCO-Hex1HexNAc2+), thus unambiguously defining a terminal linear sequence of HexNAc-HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc- (data not shown). Linkage analysis on the periodate-oxidized sample yielded predominantly 3-Gal:4-GlcNAc:t-GalNAc:3-GalNAc at a molar ratio of approximately 1.0:1.4:0.6:0.6, suggesting that, after oxidation, (i) a significant portion of the 3-GalNAc in the intact sample was converted to t-GalNAc and (ii) 3,4-GlcNAc was completely oxidized to 4-GlcNAc. It may thus be concluded that the fucoses were originally 3-linked to terminal GalNAc and to 4-linked GlcNAc, resulting in the nonreducing terminal sequence and A-type ions as shown in Fig. Z2.Figure 3:FAB spectra of the permethyl derivatives of periodate-oxidized GCX O-glycans in low (A) and high (B) mass regions. The periodate-oxidized sample was reduced with borohydride and permethylated directly. Remnants of oxidized Fuc residues were presumably acid labile and lost during the work-up. The A-type ion at m/z 709 (Hex1HexNAc2+), which is relatively less abundant than m/z 505 and 954, was shown by CAD to be a mixture of both HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc and HexNAc2-Hex sequences. Analogous A-type cleavage at Hex1HexNAc2 higher could conceivably yield the weak ion at m/z 1403, corresponding to (Hex1HexNAc3)-HexNAc-Hex+. Signals at m/z 581 and 914 which correspond to (M + H)+ of HexNAc2-C2 and Hex1HexNAc2-C4 indicate the presence of minor O-glycan chains not containing the multifucosylated repeating units. Other signals are assigned in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure Z2:Structure 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Periodate oxidation on the 3-GalNAcitol and 3,6-GalNacitol was expected to cleave between carbons 3 and 4 which upon further reduction would give the reducing end structures (I) and (II), denoted as C2 and C4, respectively (Fig. Z3). In accordance with this prediction, neither 3-GalNAcitol nor 3,6-GalNAcitol was detected in the linkage analysis of the oxidized sample. In the FAB-spectrum of the permethyl derivatives (Fig. 3A), the smallest molecular ions were observed at m/z 1275 and 1608, corresponding to (M + H)+ of Hex1HexNAc4-C2 and Hex2HexNAc4-C4, respectively. Both ions were shifted one mass unit higher when borodeuteride was used to reduce the periodate-oxidized sample. CAD on both ions yielded strong daughter ions at m/z 260, 505, and 954 corresponding to the A-type ions of HexNAc1+, HexNAc2+, and Hex1HexNAc3+, respectively (data not shown). Elimination of a MeOH moiety (from position 3) was observed only for the first two ions and not m/z 954, consistent with the deduced sequence of GalNAc-4GlcNAc-3Gal-3GalNAc constituting the nonreducing termini of these two molecular ions. Accordingly, it was concluded that defucosylated backbones of (GalNAc-4GlcNAc-3Gal-3GalNAc)-HexNAc- and (GalNAc-4GlcNAc-3Gal-3GalNAc)-HexNAc-3Gal were originally attached to C-6 and C-3 of GalNAcitol, respectively. The latter when attached to a nonbranched 3-GalNAcitol constitutes the non-fucosylated backbone of the aforementioned smallest intact O-glycans observed (Fig. 2). At higher mass (Fig. 3B), pairs of molecular ions were detected at a regular increment of a Hex1HexNAc2 unit from m/z 1275/1608 to m/z 1970/2303, m/z 2665/2998, and m/z 3360/3694. Since Gal, GalNAc, and GlcNAc are present in approximately equimolar amounts in the GCX O-glycans and, apart from t-GalNAc, 3-Gal, 3-GalNAc, and 4-GlcNAc, are the only residues detected in the periodate-oxidized sample, it is likely that a linear sequence of −4GlcNAc-3Gal-3GalNAc constitutes a regular repeating unit in the larger O-glycan chains with the 4GlcNAc being further substituted by fucoses at position 3 in intact GCX. In support of this tentative assignment, strong A-type ions were detected at m/z 1199 and 1648 in the FAB spectrum of the periodate-oxidized sample (Fig. 3A) corresponding to (Hex1HexNAc3)-HexNAc+ and (Hex1HexNAc3)-HexNAc-Hex-HexNAc+, respectively.Figure Z3:Structure 3View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequential Exo-glycosidase DigestionsTo define the anomeric configurations as well as to confirm tentative sequences, the periodate-oxidized sample was subjected to sequential β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and β-galactosidase digestions.

Fig. 3A) were significantly reduced concomitant with the appearance of m/z 464 attributable to Hex-HexNAc+ (data not shown). In addition, the molecular ions at m/z 1275 and 1608 were shifted to m/z 785 and 1118, respectively, c"

Guesella J.F. Watkins P.C. Bruns G.A.P. George-Hyslop P.S. Keuren M.L.V. Patterson D. Pagan S. Kurnit D.M. Neve R.L. Science. 1987; 235: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). APPs are multifunctional, transmembrane glycoproteins that are synthesized by a variety of cells and tissues (2Selkoe D.J. Sci. Am. 1991; 11: 68-78Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). During normal processing, APPs are cleaved within the βA4 sequence, releasing a non-amyloidogenic peptide into the extracellular space(2Selkoe D.J. Sci. Am. 1991; 11: 68-78Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Overproduced βA4 amyloid protein deposits heterogeneously throughout the brain and is associated with neuronal dysfunction and death. Transformed cells grown in vitro with exogenous βA4 amyloid protein have shown altered morphology, growth rates, and gene expression profiles(3Smith C. Anderton B.H. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1994; 20: 322-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent reports of amyloid deposition in the brain of APP transgenic mice (4Games D. Adams D. Alessandrini R. Barbour R.

Alzheimer's disease untranslated region amyloid A4 precursor protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein peripheral blood mononuclear cells bovine serum albumin polyvinylidene difluoride. Increased APP mRNA levels have been observed in central nervous system neurons of AD patients(5Johnson S.A. McNeill T. Cordell B. Finch C.E. Science. 1990; 248: 854-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As mRNA and protein levels are often correlated, the overexpression of APP mRNAs may be an important predisposing factor to βA4 amyloid protein deposition. Increased APP gene transcription and/or decreased APP mRNA degradation could account for increased steady state levels. The APP promoter was responsive to phorbol esters and phytohemagglutinin (6Trejo J. Massamiri T. Deng T. Dewji N.N. Bayney R.M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21682-21690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting endogenous mitogens such as cytokines might enhance APP gene transcription. Similarly, mitogen-driven entry into the cell cycle has been associated with substantial changes in mRNA decay rates(7Voelkerding K. Steffen D. Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 515-521PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells mRNAs decay with very heterogeneous rates. Most cytokine (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 2, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and proto-oncogene (fos, myc, myb) mRNAs are very unstable with half-lives of 15-45 min(8Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 9Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Mitogenic activation resulting in cell cycle entry often increased the steady state levels of these mRNAs by decreasing their degradation(7Voelkerding K. Steffen D. Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 515-521PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lindsten T. June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Stella G. Thompson C.B. Science. 1989; 244: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 10Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). Mitogen-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine mRNAs appears to be dependent on cis-trans interactions between cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins, such as the adenosine-uridine-binding factor and 3′-UTR AUUUA reiterations(11Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23882-23888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such regulation allows rapid and transient alteration of the gene expression in response to changes in environmental conditions. All amyloidogenic APP mRNAs that are produced from a single copy gene by alternative splicing share an identical 3′-UTR. We have previously shown that APP mRNAs decay in resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a half-life of 4 h(12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cellular activation by phorbol ester and phytohemagglutinin, APP mRNAs were stabilized with a half-life >12 h. Regulated decay was dependent on a 29 base region located approximately 200 bases downstream from the stop codon(12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region was shown to specifically interact with multiple, cytoplasmic proteins(13Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These binding activities were not detectable in resting PBMC but were rapidly induced upon cellular activation with mitogens(12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that mitogen-activated mRNA-binding proteins interacted with the 29-base element and participated in stabilization of APP mRNA(12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the mechanisms of mitogen-dependent APP mRNA stabilization, we have purified these APP mRNA-binding proteins from cytoplasm derived from a human T-cell leukemia. Amino acid and Western blot analysis unambiguously identified nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C proteins as the previously described APP mRNA-binding proteins. These data demonstrated that these dominantly (but not exclusively) nuclear proteins are likely involved in regulating the stability of cytoplasmic mRNAs through 3′-UTR site-specific interactions. Log phase human Jurkat (J32) cells (2 × 108) were washed twice in ice-cold fresh media. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). All subsequent steps were performed on ice. Cells were Dounce homogenized using a loose fit pestle until no intact cells were observed under the microscope. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved as S20 cytoplasmic fraction. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in two-thirds volume buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and nuclear proteins were extracted on ice for 30 min. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Nuclear supernatant was then dialyzed for 4 h against buffer A and stored at −80°C. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained by leukopheresis with consent from a T-cell leukemia patient. Approximately 1014 cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 5 min at room temperature and lysed by grinding in a blender for 2 min. Nuclei and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Micro assay as described by the manufacturer. The supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A (15 mM HEPES, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column. The column was washed with buffer A until all the unbound material was removed. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl, and fractions were dialyzed against buffer A. APP RNA binding activities were followed by RNA mobility shift assays throughout purification using radiolabeled APP RNA (nucleotides 2246-2313 as in (14Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar)). The highest activity fractions were pooled, concentrated using Centricon 30 concentrators (Amicon), and applied onto a Sephacryl-S300HR (Sigma) gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2 M NaCl. All fractions from gel filtration chromatography were then dialyzed against buffer A and assayed for activity. Fractions possessing the APP RNA binding activities were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A containing 1.7 M (NH4)2SO4, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose CL4B (Pharmacia) hydrophobic interaction column. Proteins were eluted with a decreasing gradient of 1.7-0 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. Fractions were dialyzed and again assayed for APP RNA binding activities. For purification of the protein components of the 42- and 47-kDa APP RNA•protein complexes, cytosolic supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column. The column was washed until all the unbound material was removed. The bound proteins were eluted with a 250-500 mM NaCl gradient in buffer A. Fractions were dialyzed against buffer A and assayed for APP RNA binding activity. Gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography were performed as described above. Active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL6B column. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0.15-2 M NaCl in buffer A. All fractions were dialyzed against buffer A and assayed for activity. Radiolabeled wild type APP RNAs (nucleotides 2246-2313) or mutant derivative as described previously (12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were produced by in vitro transcription from APP cDNA templates as described (12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after transcription at 37°C for 1 h, cDNA templates were digested with 1 unit of RNase free-DNase (Promega), extracted with phenol-chloroform and passed through a Sephadex G-50 mini-spin column. 32P-UTP-labeled RNA was scintillation counted, diluted to 5 × 104 counts/min/μl, and used as such in band-shift reactions or Northwestern blot experiments. RNA band-shift assays were performed essentially as described (13Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malter J.S. Science. 1989; 246: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were incubated with radiolabeled APP RNA (0.5 × 105 counts/min) in 10 μl of a solution composed of 15 mM HEPES, pH 8, 2 μg of yeast tRNA, 10 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 30°C for 10 min prior to the addition of 20 units of RNaseT1 (Sigma). Following a 45-min incubation at 37°C, UV cross-linking of RNA•protein complexes was performed by exposing reaction mixtures for 6 min on ice to 254 nm UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene) on the automatic setting. Subsequently, the cross-linked samples were boiled for 3 min and RNA•protein complexes resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 15-20 h with intensifying screens. Nuclear or cytoplasmic lysates (5 μg) were incubated with 35 fmol of [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled SP1 or Oct-1 ligand oligonucleotides (Promega, Madison, WI) in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, and 4% glycerol in the presence of 500 ng of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) for 20 min at room temperature. For competition studies, a 50-fold molar excess of the cold AP1, SP1, or Oct-1 oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotides. Protein•DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film for 3 h with intensifying screens. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred from gel to Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore) at 15 V for 30 min with a TransBlot semi-dry apparatus (Bio-Rad). The filter was blocked with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl (TBS) containing 5% BSA. Filters were incubated with CC98 hybridoma supernatant (neat) or 4F4 monoclonal antibody (at 1:5000 dilution) for 1.5 h in antibody incubation solution (TBS containing 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20) and then washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% BSA. Goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 5,000-fold in the antibody incubation solution was added to the filter for 1 h. After washing three times with TBS, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by reaction with a freshly prepared solution composed of 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.48 mM NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium), and 0.56 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Transferred proteins were renatured overnight in a solution containing 15 mM HEPES, pH 8, 10 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at 4°C. Membranes were then incubated with radiolabeled APP RNA (5 × 106 counts/min/ml, final concentration) for 1 h at 30°C in renaturation buffer containing 2 mg/ml tRNA. Unbound RNA was removed by washing twice at room temperature with renaturation buffer followed by autoradiography. Protein samples were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to the PVDF protein sequencing membrane (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized and excised after staining the membrane with Ponceau S for 1 min. These pieces of membranes were then washed thoroughly with deionized distilled water, air dried, and sent for amino acid sequencing to Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Microsequencing Facility, Duarte, CA. Cytosolic lysate prepared from a human T-cell leukemia was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange column. APP RNA binding activities were eluted between 250-350 mM NaCl. Gel filtration chromatography was then performed using a column packed with Sephacryl-S300HR. Active fractions were combined and hydrophobic interaction chromatography carried out using phenyl-Sepharose CL4B. Fractions were followed for activity by gel mobility shifts, and for protein profiles by Coomassie staining of 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1). To identify the binding protein's precise molecular weight, Northwestern blots were also performed (Fig. 2). Phenyl-Sepharose fractions were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with radiolabeled APP RNA. Fractions 15, 16, and 17 contained an abundant 70-kDa protein which bound radiolabeled APP RNA (Fig. 2A). These same fractions were enriched for high molecular weight, APP RNA binding activity (Fig. 1B). Fractions 17, 18, and 19 also included a closely migrating doublet of 48 and 47 kDa (Fig. 1A) which was resolved on a longer gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. NorthWestern blotting showed that both the 48- and 47-kDa proteins bound APP RNA with equal affinities (Fig. 2B). Low molecular mass APP RNA binding activity segregated with the 48- and 47-kDa proteins (Fig. 1). To determine if the Northwestern blot reactive proteins account for the observed solution phase APP RNA mobility shifts, the 70- and 48- and 47-kDa proteins were individually eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay using radiolabeled APP RNA. The 70-kDa protein formed three complexes of 140, 104, and 84 kDa while the 48- and 47-kDa proteins formed four complexes of 104, 90, 73, and 65 kDa (Fig. 3). APP RNA•protein complexes of >104, 90, and 73 kDa were probably due to cross-linking of more than one protein molecule to the radiolabeled RNA. These data, together with the results of Northwestern blotting strongly suggest that the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins are capable of independently interacting with APP RNA and likely represent the activities which we initially sought to purify. For purification of the lower molecular weight APP RNA-binding proteins, the cytosolic supernatant was adjusted to 250 mM NaCl and anion-exchange chromatography performed on a DEAE-Sepharose column. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 250-500 mM NaCl. Fractions active in forming 42- and 47-kDa APP RNA•protein complexes were concentrated and size fractionated on Sephacryl-S300HR columns. The desired activities eluted before the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa APP RNA-binding proteins described above suggesting they were multimers or associated with other proteins while transiting the column. All active fractions were then loaded onto heparin-Sepharose and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15-2 M NaCl. The activity of the fractions correlated with a 38- and 39-kDa protein doublet. Band shift assay with doublet containing fractions generated a weak 47-kDa RNA•protein complex above a dominant 42-kDa complex (Fig. 4A). To identify the relevant RNA-binding proteins, fraction 19 was resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with radiolabeled APP RNA (Fig. 4B). As shown, both proteins and a 32 kDa band bound radiolabeled APP RNA. The quantity of the 32-kDa protein did not correspond to APP RNA binding activity by gel mobility shift assay suggesting APP RNA binding was nonspecific. Previously we mutated an APP mRNA within the essential 29 base region required for protein interactions. As assessed by solution phase band-shift assays, mutant APP RNA was unable to bind proteins(12Zaidi S.H.E. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24007-24013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested if the phenyl-Sepharose fractions 17 and 18 (containing the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins) and heparin-Sepharose fraction 19 (containing the 39- and 38-kDa proteins) could discriminate between radiolabeled wild type and mutant APP RNAs in mobility shift assays (Fig. 5). As expected, the wild type APP RNA produced RNA•protein complexes, whereas mutant APP RNA did not. This suggested that the purified proteins specifically interacted with APP RNA. However, when these fractions were Northwestern blotted, the 70-, 48-, 47-, 39-, and 39-kDa proteins bound both the wild type and mutant APP RNA equally well (not shown). These data suggest that the specificity of some RNA-binding proteins may vary when they are immobilized on solid supports. The 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, and multiple peptides sequenced by standard, automated techniques. In all cases, they were completely homologous to human nucleolin (Table 1)(16Srivastava M. Fleming P.J. Pollard H.B. Burns A.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The peptide masses of tryptic digests were also identical to those expected for nucleolin. Nucleolin is a nucleolar protein and possesses autocatalytic, self-cleaving activity(17Chen C-M. Chiang S-Y. Yeh N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7754-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known to contain four C-terminal RNA-binding domains and interact with single-stranded nucleic acids(18Bugler B. Bourbon H. Lapeyre B. Wallace M.O. Chang J-H. Amalric F. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10922-10925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the 70-kDa protein, we obtained amino acid sequences on four fragments including the N terminus, a CNBr peptide before the first RNA-binding domain, and two other tryptic peptides located within the third and the fourth RNA-binding domains (Fig. 6). These data suggested that the 70-kDa protein contains all of nucleolin's four RNA-binding domains. Several of the tryptic digests of the 48- and 47-kDa proteins had identical peptide masses to those from the 70-kDa protein. Two of these were pooled with the corresponding tryptic fragment derived from the 70-kDa protein and sequenced. As this analysis produced a single, unambiguous sequence, the original peptides must have been identical. One tryptic fragment was located before the first RNA-binding domain and the other within the fourth RNA-binding domain. Taken together, the 48- and 47-kDa proteins also contained nucleolin's four RNA-binding domains. Presumably, the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins were derived from the full-length 110-kDa nucleolin molecule after self-cleavage and/or post-translational modifications.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Similarly, the 38-kDa protein was digested with trypsin, and five fragments were sequenced. All fragments showed complete identity to human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C) (19Burd G.C. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Several of the tryptic peptide masses also corresponded to the computer predicted tryptic masses of hnRNP C proteins. hnRNP C1 and C2 originate from the same gene and differ only in the addition of 13 amino acids to the C1 protein due to differential RNA splicing(19Burd G.C. Swanson M.S. Gorlach M. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9788-9792Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To confirm that the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins were nucleolin and the 39/38-kDa doublet protein was hnRNP C protein, phenyl-Sepharose fractions 15 and 18 and heparin-Sepharose fraction 19 were Western blotted and incubated with monoclonal antibodies specific for human nucleolin (CC98, (17Chen C-M. Chiang S-Y. Yeh N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7754-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or hnRNP C1 and C2 (4F4, (20Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 7). The CC98 antibody specifically reacted with the 70-kDa protein in fraction 15 and to 48- and 47-kDa proteins in fraction 18 but not to proteins in heparin-Sepharose fraction 19. The CC98 reactive proteins between 70 and 48 kDa are likely degradation products of nucleolin which have been reported by other groups(16Srivastava M. Fleming P.J. Pollard H.B. Burns A.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17Chen C-M. Chiang S-Y. Yeh N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7754-7758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results confirm that the 70-, 48-, and 47-kDa proteins are nucleolin and share the epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody CC98. The immunoblot also demonstrated that the 38- and 39-kDa proteins in heparin-Sepharose fraction 19 were hnRNP C1 and C2. Nucleolin is known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm(21Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), whereas immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence analysis have suggested hnRNP C proteins are exclusively localized within the nucleus(20Pinol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Depending on the affinity and availability of the target epitopes, immunodetection may substantially underestimate the actual quantity of protein localized within a subcellular space. Our data show nucleolin and hnRNP C exist in the cytoplasm. Because of these conflicting results, we sought to establish that nucleolin and hnRNP C proteins segregated with known, compartmental markers and were authentic constituents of the cytoplasm, rather than nuclear activities which leaked out during subcellular fractionation. Therefore, we chose to measure the DNA binding activity of transcription factors SP1 and Oct-1 which are restricted to the nucleus(22Royer H-D. Freyaldenhoven M.P. Napierski I. Spitkovsky D.D. Bauknecht T. Dathan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Henson J. Saffer J. Furneaux H. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Log phase T-cell leukemic cells (Jurkat cells) were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic S20 extracts. Equal amounts of total protein from each fraction were used for DNA mobility shifts, APP RNA mobility shifts, and Western blots with anti-nucleolin and hnRNP C antibodies. As shown in Fig. 8A, DNA mobility shifts with nuclear proteins and radiolabeled SP1 oligonucleotides produced two, slowly migrating complexes (denoted with bracket). Both complexes could be specifically competed by unlabeled SP1 but not AP1 oligonucleotides. Cytoplasmic extract failed to produce a specific shift with radiolabeled SP1 oligonucleotides. The prominent nonspecific complex observed with the cytoplasmic extract has been reported (24Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could be competed with all oligonucleotides used. We observed identical results when mobility shifts with radiolabeled Oct-1 oligonucleotides were performed (not shown). When the same extracts were used for APP RNA mobility shifts (Fig. 8B), both nuclear and cytoplasmic preparations showed appropriately sized, RNA•protein complexes. Based upon PhosphorImager quantification of the shifted complexes, approximately 75% of the nucleolin activity was nuclear and 25% was cytoplasmic, whereas 65% of the hnRNP C activity was nuclear and 35% was cytoplasmic. Tight association of hnRNP C proteins with nuclear hnRNA (25Pinol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 2: 317-325Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) may result in underrepresentation of its activity in the nuclear fract"
https://openalex.org/W2011002812,"Analysis of potentiometric titrations of the cytochrome b−245 from a X+ chronic granulomatous disease patient with an Arg54→ Ser mutation in gp91phox indicates that the mutant form of the cytochrome contains two nonidentical hemes with midpoint potentials of Em7 = −220 and Em7 = −300 mV. In the light of this information, reanalysis of redox titrations of wild-type cytochrome b−245 implies that it probably also contains two separate heme centers with midpoint potentials of Em7 = −225 and Em7 = −265 mV. The effect of the Arg54→ Ser substitution is to reduce the midpoint potential of one of the heme centers by approximately 35 mV and suggests possible interaction between Arg54 and a heme propionate side chain. Analysis of potentiometric titrations of the cytochrome b−245 from a X+ chronic granulomatous disease patient with an Arg54→ Ser mutation in gp91phox indicates that the mutant form of the cytochrome contains two nonidentical hemes with midpoint potentials of Em7 = −220 and Em7 = −300 mV.

Pyocyanine was synthesized from phenazine methosulfate using the photochemical method described in (18Knight M. Hartman P.E. Hartman Z. Young V.M. Anal.

Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using partially purified cytochrome b−245 preparations derived from 9 × 108 neutrophils in a total volume of 2.7 ml of 100 mM KCl, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0. The following mediators were used at 12.5 μM: phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, anthraquinone, anthraquinone 2-sulfonate, anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenylenediamine. Pyocyanine was added at 6 μM. Spectra were recorded between 580 and 520 nm at a series of electrode potentials, using a Uvikon 810 spectrophotometer. The degree of reduction of cytochrome b−245 was estimated from the height of the α absorbance band. An Orion 720A meter (Orion Research Inc., Boston MA) was used to measure the half-cell potential relative to a saturated calomel reference electrode. The potential was adjusted by the addition of <μl volumes of solutions of sodium dithionite (reductive titrations) and potassium ferricyanide (oxidative titrations). The accuracy of the apparatus was checked by titration of a 5 μM solution of phenosafranin (Em7.0 = −252 mV).RESULTSWe previously showed that the Arg54→ Ser mutation in gp91phox results in a cytochrome b−245 with a nonfunctional heme with a slightly shifted Soret band that is unable to accept electrons from the reduced flavin center(21Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the flavin domain of the cytochrome b−245 is fully functional, as it is capable of accepting electrons from NADPH and reducing the artificial dye acceptor iodonitrotetrazolium violet at rates equivalent to that of the wild-type cytochrome. To determine if the loss of function was due to an alteration in heme redox potential, we performed a series of oxidation-reduction potential measurements using cytochrome b−245 partially purified from neutrophil membranes from both normal and CGD patients. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The wild-type cytochrome titration could be fitted fairly well (Σ(O − E)2 = 1.1 × 10−5) to a Nernst equation curve for a single component with a Em7 = −245 mV (Fig. 1A), the same midpoint potential as originally determined(17Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, titration of the Arg54→ Ser cytochrome clearly did not fit the expected simple single component, 1-electron transfer process (Fig. 1B) (Σ(O − E)2 = 2.6 × 10−5). By assuming two components are present, the data could be fitted to curves corresponding to two species with midpoint potentials of −220 and −300 mV, each contributing 50% to the absorbance at 559 nm (Fig. 2B) (Σ(O − E)2 = 9 × 10−6). By inferring that two nonequivalent hemes are also present in the wild-type cytochrome b−245, the data in Fig. 1A can be fitted in a similar fashion to a 2-component curve with midpoint potentials of Em7 = −225 and Em7 = −265 mV (Fig. 2A) producing an excellent fit (Σ(O − E)2 = 9 × 10−6). Titrations of the cytochrome b−245 from a CGD patient with a Pro415→ His mutation in gp91phoxin which the flavin domain is nonfunctional (2Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J.

Loehr T.M. Curnutte J.T. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1627-1634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).Figure 2:Potentiometric titration of wild-type and Arg54→ Ser cytochrome b−245; two components, 1-electron transfer.

Both contain a heme center with a midpoint potential around −220 mV contributing approximately 50% to the total absorbance change; in the wild-type cytochrome, there is a second, closely spaced center with Em7 = −265 mV. The similarity in redox potentials makes resolution of the two centers difficult in the wild-type cytochrome. In the Arg54→ Ser cytochrome, the potential of the second lower potential center has been shifted downward by 35 mV from −265 mV to −300 mV and can be clearly resolved. At the present time, the locations of the hemes within the cytochrome are not known with any certainty. p22phox, which is reported to contain heme, contains only one invariant histidine, the latter lying within a sequence with homology to the heme-binding domains of a cytochrome oxidase subunit and the chromaffin granule cytochrome b561. In view of the assignment of the axial ligands in cytochrome b−245 as bis-histidinyl, a single p22phox subunit cannot wholly contain a heme group. gp91phox contains 17 histidines, none lying within sequences known to be homologous with other heme proteins. Thus, one heme group is probably shared between a p22phox and gp91phoxsubunit (or two p22phox subunits), and one heme is likely to be contained within gp91phox itself.It is thought that invariant arginine residues near the membrane surface of mitochondrial cytochromes b form hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged propionyl groups of the heme (22 and references therein). Hydropathy plots of gp91phox predict Arg54 to be at the beginning of a membrane-spanning segment close to the membrane surface, and, therefore, this residue could perform a similar hydrogen bonding function in cytochrome b−245. The adjacent membrane-spanning segment (amino acids 100-120) contains 3 potential heme-liganding histidine residues. Substitution of the positively charged Arg54 to an uncharged serine residue would decrease the electron withdrawing nature of this group and thereby lower the redox potential of the heme. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the analogous situation in iso-1-cytochrome c have demonstrated such decreases in redox potential when glutamine (−30 mV), asparagine (−34 mV), or alanine (−50 mV) were substituted for the arginine (Arg38) that forms a hydrogen bond with one of the heme propionate side chains(23Cutler R.L. Davies A.M. Creighton S. Warshel A. Moore G.R. Smith M. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3188-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In view of the fact that the redox potential of the heme in cytochrome b−245 is altered by less than 40 mV by the Arg54→ Ser substitution, it is perhaps surprising that the mutant form has no detectable O2− generating activity, particularly since we have shown that the flavin center is fully functional in this mutation(20Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further studies using site-directed mutagenesis and other naturally occurring mutant forms of cytochrome b−245 will be invaluable in dissecting the factors affecting electron transfer functions in cytochrome b−245.

RESULTSWe previously showed that the Arg54→ Ser mutation in gp91phox results in a cytochrome b−245 with a nonfunctional heme with a slightly shifted Soret band that is unable to accept electrons from the reduced flavin center(21Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the flavin domain of the cytochrome b−245 is fully functional, as it is capable of accepting electrons from NADPH and reducing the artificial dye acceptor iodonitrotetrazolium violet at rates equivalent to that of the wild-type cytochrome. To determine if the loss of function was due to an alteration in heme redox potential, we performed a series of oxidation-reduction potential measurements using cytochrome b−245 partially purified from neutrophil membranes from both normal and CGD patients. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The wild-type cytochrome titration could be fitted fairly well (Σ(O − E)2 = 1.1 × 10−5) to a Nernst equation curve for a single component with a Em7 = −245 mV (Fig. 1A), the same midpoint potential as originally determined(17Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, titration of the Arg54→ Ser cytochrome clearly did not fit the expected simple single component, 1-electron transfer process (Fig. 1B) (Σ(O − E)2 = 2.6 × 10−5). By assuming two components are present, the data could be fitted to curves corresponding to two species with midpoint potentials of −220 and −300 mV, each contributing 50% to the absorbance at 559 nm (Fig. 2B) (Σ(O − E)2 = 9 × 10−6). By inferring that two nonequivalent hemes are also present in the wild-type cytochrome b−245, the data in Fig. 1A can be fitted in a similar fashion to a 2-component curve with midpoint potentials of Em7 = −225 and Em7 = −265 mV (Fig. 2A) producing an excellent fit (Σ(O − E)2 = 9 × 10−6).

DISCUSSIONFrom the data presented above, it appears that both wild-type and mutant cytochromes contain two separate, nonidentical hemes. Both contain a heme center with a midpoint potential around −220 mV contributing approximately 50% to the total absorbance change; in the wild-type cytochrome, there is a second, closely spaced center with Em7 = −265 mV. The similarity in redox potentials makes resolution of the two centers difficult in the wild-type cytochrome. In the Arg54→ Ser cytochrome, the potential of the second lower potential center has been shifted downward by 35 mV from −265 mV to −300 mV and can be clearly resolved. At the present time, the locations of the hemes within the cytochrome are not known with any certainty. p22phox, which is reported to contain heme, contains only one invariant histidine, the latter lying within a sequence with homology to the heme-binding domains of a cytochrome oxidase subunit and the chromaffin granule cytochrome b561. In view of the assignment of the axial ligands in cytochrome b−245 as bis-histidinyl, a single p22phox subunit cannot wholly contain a heme group. gp91phox contains 17 histidines, none lying within sequences known to be homologous with other heme proteins. Thus, one heme group is probably shared between a p22phox and gp91phoxsubunit (or two p22phox subunits), and one heme is likely to be contained within gp91phox itself.It is thought that invariant arginine residues near the membrane surface of mitochondrial cytochromes b form hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged propionyl groups of the heme (22 and references therein). Hydropathy plots of gp91phox predict Arg54 to be at the beginning of a membrane-spanning segment close to the membrane surface, and, therefore, this residue could perform a similar hydrogen bonding function in cytochrome b−245. The adjacent membrane-spanning segment (amino acids 100-120) contains 3 potential heme-liganding histidine residues. Substitution of the positively charged Arg54 to an uncharged serine residue would decrease the electron withdrawing nature of this group and thereby lower the redox potential of the heme. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the analogous situation in iso-1-cytochrome c have demonstrated such decreases in redox potential when glutamine (−30 mV), asparagine (−34 mV), or alanine (−50 mV) were substituted for the arginine (Arg38) that forms a hydrogen bond with one of the heme propionate side chains(23Cutler R.L. Davies A.M. Creighton S. Warshel A. Moore G.R. Smith M. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3188-3197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).In view of the fact that the redox potential of the heme in cytochrome b−245 is altered by less than 40 mV by the Arg54→ Ser substitution, it is perhaps surprising that the mutant form has no detectable O2− generating activity, particularly since we have shown that the flavin center is fully functional in this mutation(20Cross A.R.

https://openalex.org/W2051746356,"Recent studies have demonstrated the biological importance of the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) with proteins. Protein-associated targets of NO include heme, Cys, and Tyr. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was used to monitor the results of exposure of model peptides and an enzyme to NO under different conditions and thus addressed aspects of NO-protein interactions. The molecular mass of a decapeptide containing a single Cys residue increased by 29 Da upon treatment with NO under aerobic and acidic conditions, consistent with the substitution of one NO moiety. The mass of reduced somatostatin, a peptide containing two Cys residues, increased by 58 Da, consistent with the substitution of two NO moieties. These substitutions were prevented by pretreatment of the peptides with Nethylmaleimide. The strength of the nitrosothiol bond was examined by varying the amount of energy applied to the peptide ions and indicated a labile species. Cys residues were very rapidly nitrosated, while other reactions were observed to occur at much slower rates. These include the further oxidation of nitrosothiol to sulfonic acid and nitration of Tyr. Peptides treated with NO at physiological pH were observed to undergo dimerization as well as nitrosation. These studies were extended to the enzyme p21ras, whose activity has been postulated to be modulated by nitrosothiol formation, and revealed the formation of a single nitrosothiol on p21ras upon NO treatment.

One reason is the labile nature of nitrosothiol (RSNO) bonds. Nitrosothiol bonds are thought to occur via substitution by NO+, or other nitrogen oxides, on free sulfhydryl groups(3Stamler J.S.

Science. 1992; 257: 1885-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and conditions can be varied such that the protein of interest is subjected to gentle perturbations during analysis in an effort to preserve labile structures. We employed ESI-MS to monitor the results of exposure of model peptides and an enzyme to NO under different conditions and thus addressed aspects of NO-protein interactions. A peptide (KNNLKECGLY, mass = 1181.4 Da) corresponding to the C terminus of the G protein Giα1 was commercially synthesized. Somatostatin was from Sigma (catalog no. S-9129). Purified bacterially expressed p21H-ras was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Manor, Department of Pharmacology, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). NO solutions were prepared as we previously described(11Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution, pH 8.0, in a rubber-stoppered tube was sparged for 15 min with N2 and then 15 min with NO gas (Matheson Gas, East Rutherford, NJ). This resulted in a saturated solution of NO (1.25 mM). This solution also contained higher oxides of NO that were not quantified. The electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained on a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-700 triple quadrupole instrument. Unless otherwise indicated, peptides and protein samples were electrosprayed from acidified (acetic acid) 50% methanolic solutions (pH 3.0), and the concentrations of the analyte electrospray solutions were in the range of 10-20 μM. The measurements of pH were made with a PHM 95 pH meter (Radiometer, Copenhagen) calibrated in aqueous solutions. No corrections were applied for the pH measurements of solutions containing methanol. The analyte solutions were infused into the mass spectrometer source using a Harvard syringe pump (model 24000-001) at a rate of 3 μl/min through a 100-μm (inner diameter) fused silica capillary. The positive ion spectra obtained were an average of 16 scans and were acquired at a rate of 3 s/scan. The ion signals were recorded by a Finnigan ICIS data system operated on a DECstation 5000/120 system. The reconstructed molecular mass profiles were obtained by using a deconvolution algorithm (FinniganMAT). In ESI-MS experiments, the degree of energy input into the peptide and protein ions can be controlled by two independent variables(12Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 4: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). One variable is the temperature of the capillary transfer tube. The other variable is the potential difference between the capillary transfer tube and the tube lens of the mass spectrometer (ΔV). The majority of mass spectra were obtained at a mass resolution that did not resolve the individual isotopic components. However, when more detailed information was required, the mass resolution was increased sufficiently to resolve the individual isotopic components. The regulation of protein and enzyme function by NO through nitrosation of critical Cys residues is emerging as an important control switch in NO signaling(3Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 7Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar, 8Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The RSNO bond is of a labile nature and thus difficult to study and quantify. Therefore, we applied ESI-MS to characterize NO-peptide interactions under conditions where RSNO formation is favored. A peptide (KNNLKECGLY, mass = 1181.4 Da) corresponding to the C terminus of the G protein Giα1 was either untreated (Fig. 1A) or treated with (Fig. 1B) 10-fold molar excess NO. Treatment with NO for 5 min at pH 3.0 resulted in detection of a new species with a mass 29.0 ± 0.2 Da greater than the starting peptide. The observed difference of 29 Da corresponds to the molecular mass of NO (30 Da) minus the mass of the substituted proton (1 Da). This mass difference of 29 Da shows unequivocally that treatment of this peptide with NO at pH 3.0 resulted in a substitution reaction. Pretreatment of this peptide with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an irreversible thiol-binding reagent(14Partis M.D. Griffiths D.G. Roberts G.C. J. Protein Chem. 1983; 2: 263-277Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), led to a new species with a mass equal to that of peptide + NEM (Fig. 1C). Subsequent treatment of this complex with NO did not yield a species with higher mass (Fig. 1D), indicating that the NEM modification blocked reaction of NO with the peptide. This demonstrates that NO substitution had originally occurred on the Cys residue (Fig. 1B). Treatment of peptide with NO at pH 7.8 also led to nitrosothiol formation but to a much lesser extent. The major product at pH 7.8 was peptide dimer (Fig. 1E). Modification of proteins by NO to yield tyrosine nitration (Tyr-NO2) or sulfonic acid (SO3H) has been suggested(15Lepoivre M. Fieschi F. Coves J. Thelander L. Fontecave M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 16Oae S. Kim Y.H. Fukushima D. Shinhama K. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1978; : 913-917Crossref Google Scholar). We examined the peptide-NO adducts formed after various times of exposure of the test peptide (KNNLKECGLY) to NO using ESI-MS. After 5 min of exposure to NO, nitrosothiol was the major product formed at pH 3.0 (Fig. 1B), which persisted to 45 min (data not shown). However, after 2 h and more prominently at 7 h, two new species arose. One had an increased mass of 49 Da greater than that of the starting peptide, likely corresponding to a sulfonic acid derivative. The other had an increased mass of 94 Da greater than that of the starting peptide, likely corresponding to a peptide with both Tyr-NO2 (45 Da) and SO3H (Fig. 2, A and B). After 24 h, very little starting peptide and nitrosothiol remained (Fig. 2, C and D), and the majority of the peptide had either SO3H or both Tyr-NO2 and SO3H (Fig. 2, C and D). Formation of SO3H was confirmed by pretreatment of the peptide with NEM. Treatment of the peptide-NEM complex (mass = 1307 Da) for 70 h with NO yielded both the starting complex and a peptide complex with a mass increased by 45 Da (mass = 1352 Da, Fig. 2E), indicating that only nitration occurred. Neither sulfonic acid nor nitration and sulfonic acid derivatization was seen (expected mass = 1356 and 1401 Da, respectively). A number of low abundance reaction products was also observed. Thus, ESI-MS detected nitrosation, nitration, and sulfonic acid formation on a peptide upon exposure to NO. The order of reactivity was: RSNO Tyr-NO2 = SO3H. We studied the nature of the peptide-RSNO bond by altering the temperature of the metal capillary transfer tube. Our indicated temperatures of the capillary transfer tube do not reflect the temperatures of the peptide and protein ions but rather provide a relative measure of energy input. We found that at 125°C (Fig. 1B) or 150°C (Fig. 3A), the nitrosated peptide was readily detected. At 175°C, approximately 50% of the nitrosothiol bonds was broken (Fig. 3B), and at 200°C nitrosothiols were undetectable (Fig. 3C). The observed mass difference between the nitrosated peptide and the heat-induced decomposition product was 30.1 ± 0.2 Da. This mass difference of 30 Da demonstrates that homolytic decomposition of the RSNO bond occurred, yielding the thiyl radical (i.e. R-S). These results indicate that ESI-MS can also be used to determine the relative strength of RSNO bonds and that gentle conditions are required for their detection. Somatostatin is a 1637.7-Da peptide hormone containing two Cys residues that are normally disulfide-linked. We reduced somatostatin with dithioerythritol (DTE) overnight at room temperature (somatostatin:DTE, 1:5). We then added NO in either a 1:5:10 (somatostatin:DTE:NO) ratio (Fig. 4A) or a 1:5:30 ratio (Fig. 4B). As seen in Fig. 4A, addition of a slight excess of NO yielded oxidized somatostatin and species of increased mass consistent with one or two RSNO bonds. When NO is added in greater excess, analysis by ESI-MS detects oxidized somatostatin and somatostatin with two RSNO bonds (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment of reduced somatostatin with NEM yielded a species of 250-Da increased mass (arising from modification of reduced somatostatin by 2 NEM molecules) and prevented NO from altering the mass (data not shown), indicating that RSNO bonds are responsible for the increased molecular mass observed in Fig. 4, A and B. NO had no effect on native somatostatin after treatment for 10 min (data not shown). These data demonstrate that nitrosothiols can form in a concentration-dependent manner and that the stoichiometry of modification is easily determined with ESI-MS. We have previously identified G proteins, and particularly p21ras, as potential targets of NO(8Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 11Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lander H.M. Sehajpal P. Levine D.M. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we utilized ESI-MS to determine if NO could modify p21ras through formation of nitrosothiol bonds. Purified bacterially expressed p21ras yielded three major species on ESI-MS (Fig. 5A). The species with a molecular mass of 21,296 ± 2 Da corresponds to that of the native enzyme and the species 20,575 ± 2 Da to that of the enzyme from which 7 C-terminal amino acids have been lost during purification. Treatment of our p21ras preparation for 5 min with 4-fold excess NO resulted in an increase of both species by 30 ± 3 Da (Fig. 5B). These modified species are not stable at a capillary temperature of 200°C, indicating their labile character. Bacterially expressed p21ras has five reduced Cys residues available for nitrosation. The present ESI-MS studies indicate that only one Cys is nitrosated. Thus, this technique also allows for quantitation of RSNO on proteins. We have used ESI-MS to identify, quantify, and characterize modifications of peptides and protein as a result of exposure to NO. In a peptide containing one Cys residue, a nitrosothiol bond was identified and its thermodynamic properties examined by altering the temperature of the electrospray capillary transfer tube. The bond was found to be labile, and therefore its detection requires the relatively gentle conditions used in these studies. It should also be possible to calculate the ΔG of this bond relative to other protein modifications known to regulate protein function (e.g. phosphorylation). At physiological pH, nitrosothiol formation occurred to a lesser extent than at acidic pH, and peptide dimer became the predominant product. Thus, NO can facilitate transnitrosation reactions as has previously been suggested(3Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 18Lipton S.A. Choi Y-B. Pan Z-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). The high accuracy of molecular mass determination using ESI-MS (error ≈ 0.02% or ±0.2 Da in our peptide of 1181.4 Da) permitted us to determine that the NO-modified peptide differed from that of the starting peptide by 29.0 ± 0.2 Da. Therefore, we have clearly identified that an RSNO formed concurrent with removal of the RSH proton. Additional chemical modifications were also identified, which include nitration and sulfonic acid formation. These latter modifications formed at a much slower rate than nitrosothiols, which were detected in less than 5 min. Formation of SO3H and Tyr-NO2 was first seen after 2 h of treatment and was fully developed after 7 h. The order of reaction in our model peptide was RSNO Tyr-NO2 = SO3H. Therefore, nitrosothiol formation would likely be a preferred regulator of protein function as compared with other modifications due to NO. The number of nitrosothiols formed on reduced somatostatin, a peptide hormone with two Cys residues, was found to be dose-dependent and controlled by the amount of reducing agent present. This suggests that in the cell, where endogenous modulators of redox state such as glutathione exist, formation of RSNO on proteins may be regulated. Furthermore, p21ras, a 21-kDa enzyme whose regulation by NO has been postulated to be controlled by nitrosation(8Lander H.M. Ogiste J.S. Pearce S.F.A. Levi R. Novogrodsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7017-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), was demonstrated to have one nitrosothiol formed upon treatment with NO. This enzyme has five free Cys residues, and, therefore, the formation of only one RSNO suggests the possibility that nitrosation of this enzyme occurs at a specific site. The regulation of some heme-containing enzymes, such as guanylyl cyclase, by NO is known to occur through binding of NO to the Fe2+ of heme(6Ignarro L.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has emerged that suggests that NO may also regulate certain heme-containing enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase-1 (prostaglandin H synthase-1), through nitrosothiols(19Hajjar D.P. Lander H.M. Pearce S.F.A. Upmacis R.K. Pomerantz K.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3340-3346Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We are currently exploring the interaction of NO with heme-containing enzymes using ESI-MS. Current methods of colorimetric detection of nitrosothiols require large amounts of sample (20Saville B. Analyst (Lond.). 1958; 83: 670-672Crossref Google Scholar) and require acidification of the sample. Other spectroscopic methods exist including UV, IR, and NMR techniques. Again sample amount, purity, and quantitation are serious difficulties associated with these methods. ESI-MS can detect nitrosothiols in very small amounts of sample and can determine the stoichiometry of substitution. Furthermore, this method allows coupling to high pressure liquid chromatography, which should enable on-line mass spectrometric peptide mapping of sites of RSNO formation."
https://openalex.org/W2056756821,"Formation of disulfide bonds in Escherichia coli envelope proteins is facilitated by the Dsb system, which is thought to consist of at least two components, a periplasmic soluble enzyme (DsbA) and a membrane-bound factor (DsbB). Although it is believed that DsbA directly oxidizes substrate cysteines and DsbB reoxidizes DsbA to allow multiple rounds of reactions, direct evidence for the DsbA-DsbB interaction has been lacking. We examined intracellular activities of mutant forms of DsbA, DsbA30S and DsbA33S, in which one of its active site cysteines (Cys30 or Cys33, respectively) has been replaced by serine. The DsbA33S protein was found to dominantly interfere with the disulfide bond formation and to form intermolecular disulfide bonds with numerous other proteins when cells were grown in media containing low molecular weight disulfides such as GSSG. In the absence of added GSSG, DsbA33S protein remained specifically disulfide-bonded with DsbB. These in vivo results not only confirm the previous findings that Cys30 of DsbA is hyper-reactive in vitro but provide evidence that DsbA indeed interacts selectively with DsbB. We propose that the Cys30-mediated DsbA-DsbB complex represents an intermediate state of DsbA-DsbB recycling reaction that has been fixed because of the absence of Cys33 on DsbA.

After translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotic cells or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotic cells, secretory proteins are folded into functional conformations. One characteristic feature of the folding of secretory proteins is that many of them must acquire correctly positioned disulfide bonds(1Bardwell J.C.A. Beckwith J. Cell. 1993; 74: 769-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Remarkable progress has been achieved recently in our understanding of how protein disulfides are formed in the periplasmic space of living prokaryotic cells.

DsbA and DsbC are soluble proteins of the periplasm while DsbB is a cytoplasmic membrane protein with four transmembrane segments(7Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J.

The role of DsbB has been proposed to reoxidize the reduced form of DsbA to enable it to work again(4Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 16Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Assuming the DsbA-DsbB circuit, it is still unknown what are the acceptors of electrons that are obligatorily liberated upon oxidation of the thiols. Little is known either about DsbC, which, according to a proposal(16Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), might be specialized in isomerization of disulfide bonds. The Dsb proteins all contain a Cys-X-X-Cys motif seen characteristically for the redox active sites in the thioredoxin-like oxidoreductases(17Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The one in DsbA is Cys30-Pro-His-Cys33. DsbB contains a set of thioredoxin-like motifs as well as additional cysteine residues, among which 4 essential Cys residues facing the periplasm have been identified(7Jander G. Martin N.L. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was shown that mutational alterations of either Cys30 or Cys33 inactivate the enzymatic activity of DsbA in vivo(18Yu J. McLaughlin S. Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4326-4330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in vitro(10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E.

Cys30 is exposed to the solvent, is very reactive, and has a low pKa value, whereas Cys33 is shielded from the solvent(9Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E.

In this work, we examined in vivo behaviors of the active site mutants of DsbA that we constructed previously(13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4273-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that the mutant form of DsbA (DsbA33S) in which Cys33 was replaced by serine exhibited three unusual phenotypes. First, it dominantly interferes with the functioning of the DsbA-DsbB system. Second, it is disulfide-bonded with a number of cellular proteins when cells are grown in the presence of small molecule disulfides such as GSSG. Finally, it forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with DsbB irrespective of the presence or absence of GSSG in the medium. We suggest that DsbA preferentially interacts with DsbB, and the lack of Cys33 makes the interaction abortive with respect to the catalytic turnover normally required for the functioning of the system. E. coli K12 strain CU141 (19Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a dsb+ strain. Strains SS140 and SS141 were CU141 derivatives into which the dsbA33::Tn5 mutation (2Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K.

Plasmid pSS18 carried dsbA+ and was constructed by cloning the 1.0-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the pUC19-derived dsbA+ plasmid (13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol.

Plasmids pSS19 and pSS20 were similar to pSS18, except for the presence of the dsbA30S or the dsbA33S mutation (13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4273-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that caused a Cys30 to Ser or a Cys33 to Ser substitution in DsbA, respectively. pSS39 carried dsbB+; the dsbB region of the chromosome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′AAACTGCGCACTCTATGC and 5′CGGGGATCCTTAGCGACCGAACAGATC, digested with NsiI and BamHI, and cloned into PstI-BamHI cleaved pSTV29 (a pACYC184-derived lac promoter vector from Takara Shuzo). pSS42 encoded a variant of DsbB in which its carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acid residues had been replaced by a sequence of 20 amino acids, IKLIDEEQKLISEEDLLRKR, including a Myc epitope sequence; a 68-base pair EcoRV-KpnI fragment from a vector (pTYE006) carrying a Myc-encoding sequence1 1T.

Kamitani S. Kusukawa N. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22440-22445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the Myc antibody, the second antibodies used were against mouse IgG. β-lactamase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmids overexpressing either wild-type DsbA protein, the DsbA30S mutant protein, or the DsbA33S mutant protein were introduced into the dsbA-disrupted cells. Disulfide bond formation was assessed by examining electrophoretic mobility of Bla, which normally contains one intramolecular disulfide bond in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Consistent with the previous biochemical results(10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4273-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both DsbA30S and DsbA33S were inactive in supporting Bla oxidation in vivo (Fig. 1, lanes2 and 3). The same plasmids were then introduced into wild-type cells. It was found that cells overproducing DsbA33S were defective in disulfide bond formation of Bla (Fig. 1, lane6), indicating that DsbA with a single cysteine at residue 30 is not only inactive but also interfering with the normal functioning of the Dsb system. Fig. 2 shows similar electropherograms as shown above, but probed with anti-DsbA antibodies. In cells (with intact dsbA on the chromosome) overproducing DsbA33S, a number of higher molecular mass bands were found to react with anti-DsbA (Fig. 2A, lane4). Most of these higher molecular mass bands disappeared under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lane6), suggesting that they represented mixed disulfides between DsbA and other proteins. Results of non-reducing/reducing two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (data not shown) suggested that the band of about 41 kDa (arrow in Fig. 2) represented a dimeric form of DsbA.3 3Note that the 41-kDa band in lane4 of Fig. 2 actually contained two components, the DsbA dimer and an unrelated background protein that was observed in broth-grown cells (lanes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6). Cells overproducing DsbA+ or DsbA30S contained only a few cross-reacting proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes2 and 3), some of which (e.g. a band of about 33 kDa) were unrelated to the disulfide cross-linking we were addressing since they persisted under the reducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes5 and 6)3 and they were observed even in the dsbA-disrupted cell (data not shown). When cells were grown on minimal salt medium rather than on broth, most of the higher molecular mass cross-reacting polypeptides were not produced (Fig. 2B, lane1), with an exception of a protein of about 36 kDa (arrowhead in Fig. 2). Evidence presented in the following section shows that the 36-kDa protein represents a DsbA33S-DsbB complex. The difference between the broth and the salt media examined with respect to the production of the cross-linked DsbA complexes appeared to be due to the presence of small molecule disulfides such as cystine and GSSG in the former. This was clearly demonstrated by the results presented in Fig. 2B, in which effects of GSSG addition to the M9 medium were examined. Thus, even in M9 medium, inclusion of GSSG enhanced the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bonds involving DsbA33S (Fig. 2B, compare lanes1 and 3). GSSG was effective at concentration of 1 mM (data not shown) or 10 mM (Fig. 2B). It was found additionally that the disulfide-mediated intermolecular cross-linking was more extensive in the absence of chromosomal dsbA+ function than in its presence (Fig. 2B, compare lanes3 and 4). The apparent molecular weight of the major DsbA33S-cross-linked polypeptide formed in minimal medium (without GSSG) was similar to the sum of those of DsbA and DsbB. It indeed represented a complex between DsbA33S and DsbB as the following lines of evidence indicated. First, this particular product fractionated with membranes (data not shown). Second, it was undetectable when DsbA33S was overproduced in the dsbB::kan5 cells (Fig. 3A, compare lanes1 and 2). Third, when both DsbA33S and DsbB were overproduced, the intensity of this product increased (Fig. 3A, compare lanes5 and 6). Finally, when a DsbB′-Myc fusion protein that was 10 amino acids longer than the normal DsbB was expressed from a plasmid, a new band of higher apparent molecular mass was created (Fig. 3A, lane4). A band that precisely coincided with this new band was stained by antibody against the Myc epitope but only when DsbA33S was synthesized simultaneously (Fig. 3B, lane2). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (not shown) indicated that, upon reduction, mobility of the Myc-cross-reacting material was shifted to that of DsbB′-Myc (see Fig. 3B, lane1).4 4In the experiments reported in Fig. 3B, whole cell proteins were first precipitated by trichloroacetic acid. Although this treatment was necessary to reduce the background stainings as well as to avoid a possible artifact during the sample manipulations (21), it proved to reduce the recovery of the free form of DsbB′-Myc protein (asterisk in lane1 of Fig. 3B). The acid treatment did not appear to lower the recovery of DsbA33S-DsB′-Myc complex. These results, taken together, indicate that the DsbA33S protein specifically interacts with DsbB to form disulfide-bonded heterodimers. Previous studies showed that purified DsbA33S mutant protein retains activities to bind glutathione as well as to reduce oxidized insulin(10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also noted that the mutant form of DsbA can stimulate oxidative folding of a mutant human lysozyme in the presence of GSSG(13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4273-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Bardwell et al. (4Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) showed that GSSG phenotypically suppresses the dsbB disruption, probably by reoxidizing the reduced form of DsbA. We examined effects of GSSG on the in vivo complementation and interference activities of DsbA33S. Inclusion of 1 mM GSSG in the medium partially restored the Bla-oxidizing ability of DsbA33S (Fig. 4, compare lanes2 and 6). GSSG at 1 mM almost completely abolished the dominant negative effect of DsbA33S (Fig. 4, lane7). This concentration of GSSG only slightly enhanced disulfide bond formation in the dsbB::kan5 strain (Fig. 4, lane8), while 10 mM GSSG effectively suppressed the dsbB mutation (Fig. 4, lane12). GSSG up to 10 mM did not restore the defective disulfide bond formation in the dsbA-disrupted strain ((4Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar)),5 5S. Kishigami, E. Kanaya, M. Kikuchi, and K. Ito, unpublished results. indicating that GSSG can help the functioning of DsbA in the absence of DsbB but cannot substitute for the DsbA function itself(4Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The effective suppression of the dominant interference by 1 mM GSSG might be due to activation of the DsbA33S form of DsbA. Such an unusual mode of action of DsbA should be independent of the DsbB function. Like in any other thioredoxin-like oxidoreductases, the two cysteine residues of DsbA are of vital importance for the physiological functions of this enzyme. Detailed studies established that the two cysteines have different reactivities. The amino-terminally located Cys30 has unusually low pKa(12Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and is very reactive with alkylating reagents as well as with small molecule sulfhydryls(9Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mixed disulfide between GSH and Cys30 of DsbA is very unstable(10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although similar instability has been noted for the oxidized form of wild-type DsbA (9Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), DsbA in the periplasmic space of living cells is mostly in the oxidized state, provided that DsbB is functional(5Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast to Cys30, Cys33 residue is buried inside the protein and inaccessible from the solvent(9Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Nelson J.W. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Apparently, the asymmetric nature of the two cysteines contributes to the catalytic reactivity of this unusual enzyme(16Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It is shown here that the DsbA33S mutant protein, in which only the reactive Cys30 residue remains, is disulfide-bonded with a number of cellular proteins in the presence of low molecular weight disulfides. It might be possible that the reactive Cys30 residue first forms mixed disulfides with cystine or glutathione added exogenously. This binding may activate the protein. Due possibly to the polypeptide-binding nature of DsbA(8Martin J.C.L. Bardwell J.C.A. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), the disulfide bond may be then transferred to a free cysteine on the substrate protein. Repeating this cycle might lead to the formation of protein disulfides in the presence of GSSG(13Kanaya E. Anaguchi H. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4273-4278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the formation of disulfide-bonded complexes between DsbA33S and general protein substrates requires the presence of GSSG or other small molecule disulfides, DsbA33S is preferentially disulfide-bonded with DsbB in the absence of GSSG. It should be noted that our method of detection, in which cellular proteins were first denatured by trichloroacetic acid and then dissolved in SDS in the presence of iodoacetamide, precludes the possibility of artificial formation of the disulfide-bonded complexes after cell disruption(21Kishigami S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It seems likely that DsbA has specific affinity to DsbB and that Cys30 of DsbA can react with one of the four essential cysteines of DsbB without mediation of GSSG. The high reactivity of Cys30 of DsbA with a cysteine residue of DsbB will contribute to the dominant interference by the DsbA33S mutant protein, which should sequester the DsbB protein in the heterodimeric complex. More importantly, the high reactivity of the cysteine residues on the DsbA and the DsbB protein will contribute to the proposed (4Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 16Bardwell J.C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) reoxidation of the reduced form of DsbA by DsbB. We suppose it likely that the DsbA33S-DsbB complex we observed here represents an intermediate state of DsbA-DsbB recycling reaction that has been fixed because of the absence of the partner cysteine, Cys33, on DsbA. We thank Jim Bardwell and Jon Beckwith for providing the dsbB::kan5 mutant, Tohru Yoshihisa for the plasmid carrying the Myc sequence and helpful comments and discussion, Yoshinori Akiyama for helpful discussion throughout the work, and Kiyoko Mochizuki and Kuniko Ueda for technical support."

In this study, the mouse phospholipid transfer protein cDNA was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions based on the cDNA sequence of human phospholipid transfer protein.

Mouse plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity is 1.5-2 times that of human plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity. As in humans, mouse peripheral tissues displayed a higher abundance of phospholipid transfer protein mRNA than observed in central organs. The order of phospholipid transfer protein mRNA expression was as follows: lung > adipose tissue, placenta, testis > brain > muscle, heart, liver. We examined the regulation of phospholipid transfer protein expression by dietary cholesterol and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. A high fat, high cholesterol diet caused a significant increase (35%) in plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity and a significant increase (18%) in high density lipoprotein phospholipids. This increased activity was accompanied by ∼100% increase in phospholipid transfer protein mRNA in lung. After lipopolysaccharide injection, plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity was decreased by ∼66%. This decrease in activity was associated with a similar decrease in phospholipid transfer protein mRNA in lung, adipose tissue, and liver. The decrease in plasma phospholipid transfer protein activity was also associated with a significant increase (17%) in high density lipoprotein phospholipid concentration. The opposite changes in phospholipids levels with lipopolysaccharide treatment and dietary cholesterol despite similarly increased high density lipoprotein phospholipids levels indicate that high density lipoprotein phospholipids levels are likely determined both by phospholipid transfer protein levels and by gradients of phospholipids concentration between high density lipoprotein and other phospholipids sources.

There is accumulating evidence indicating that PLTP plays an important role in the remodeling of lipoproteins. In vitro experiments show that partially purified PLTP mediates both the transfer and exchange of phospholipids between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and HDL during lipolysis(5Tall A.R. Krumholz S. Olivecrona T. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 842-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP can also cause conversion of HDL3 to larger (10.9 nm) and smaller (7.8 nm) particles in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion(6Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4032-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tu A.Y. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23098-23105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP activity also modulates the activities of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)(3Tollefson J.H. Ravnik S. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In in vivo experiments using partially purified PLTP injected into rats, the turnover rate of [14C]phosphatidylcholine ether-labeled HDL increases by 50%. This suggests that PLTP can facilitate the transfer of radiolabeled phospholipid between HDL and tissues or that PLTP increases the rate of HDL uptake by these tissues(8Pownall H.J. Hickson-Bick D. Maassay J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). phospholipid transfer protein high density lipoprotein cholesteryl ester transfer protein lipopolysaccharide binding protein dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine low density lipoprotein very low density lipoprotein. PLTP and CETP, a protein that transfers phospholipids as well as cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, each account for about 50% of the plasma phospholipid transfer activities(9Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of PLTP to a cholesteryl ester transfer assay containing CETP results in a marked enhancement of CETP activity (3Tollefson J.H. Ravnik S. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by a mechanism that is most likely the enhanced binding of CETP to phospholipid-enriched HDL(9Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP activity plays a central role in HDL metabolism, and its transcription is up-regulated by dietary cholesterol(17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins are evolutionarily related and are part of a gene family that also includes lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tu A.-Y. Deeb S.S. Iwasaki L. Day J.R. Albers J.J. Bioch. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). LBP and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein modulate the organism's response to bacterial infections by their ability to bind lipopolysaccharide(12Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp.

Recent studies suggest that CETP may also be involved in the acute phase response because it also binds lipopolysaccharide,2 2P. S. Tobias, R. J. Ulevitch, P. Kussie, and A. Tall, unpublished observations. and its transcription is down-regulated by lipopolysaccharide treatment(15Masucci-Magoulas L. Moulin P. Jiang X.-C. Richardson H. Walsh A.M. Breslow J. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, unlike CETP, LBP is markedly up-regulated by lipopolysaccharide treatment(14Su G.L. Freeswick P.D. Geller D.A. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Wan Y.H. Billiar T.R. Tweardy D.J. Simmons R.L. Wang S.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 743-752PubMed Google Scholar). Given the similarities among the members of the lipid transfer/lipopolysaccharide binding protein gene family, we investigated whether mouse PLTP is also regulated by dietary cholesterol and lipopolysaccharide. We chose the mouse as a model organism for two reasons. First, mouse plasma has no measurable CETP mass and so its plasma phospholipid transfer activity would be due solely to PLTP. This would simplify future studies on the phospholipid metabolism of this animal. Second, in order to lay the foundations of PLTP transgenesis and gene knock-out manipulations in mouse we need to characterize the structure, pattern of expression, and gene regulation of PLTP in the wild-type mouse. So, in this study we have isolated and characterized PLTP cDNA from C57BL/6 mouse and determined the tissue distribution of its mRNA. We indicate here that PLTP has a tissue distribution that is distinct from that of the other gene family member and that lipopolysaccharide and dietary cholesterol regulate its expression. First strand cDNA was synthesized from mouse lung mRNA using oligo(dT) as a primer. The mouse PLTP cDNA was amplified from total cDNA by primer extension and polymerase chain reactions (21Agellon L.B. Quinet E.M. Gillette T.G. Drayna D.T. Brown M.L. Tall A.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) using rTth DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer) and several degenerate primers based on the human PLTP cDNA sequence(10Day J.R.

The amplified products were cloned into Bluescript KS- (Stratagene) and sequenced according to standard procedures. Total RNA was isolated from various tissues using the lithium chloride/urea extraction method(18Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). The integrity and quality of all RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis on agarose/borate gels before mRNA isolation. Polyadenylated RNA was isolated from total RNA by batch isolation using oligo(dT)-cellulose. Northern blot analysis of mRNA was performed as described previously(19Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). A fragment of the human PLTP cDNA (112 base pairs, 1544-1655) was cloned into Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene) and used to prepare radiolabeled cRNA probes for the RNase protection assay, which was performed as described previously(17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid transfer activity was measured with [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC; DuPont NEN) -containing vesicles that were prepared as described previously(20Speijer H. Groener J.E.M. Van Ramshorst E. Van Tol A. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 90: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μmol of egg phosphatidylcholine containing 10 nmol of [3H]DPPC was dried under a stream of nitrogen, resuspended in 1 ml of a solution of 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, was probe-sonicated, and then was centrifuged to remove lipid aggregates. Transfer of radiolabeled phospholipids was measured by incubating an aliquot of 100 μl of each sample with [3H]DPPC vesicles (125 nmol of phosphatidylcholine) and HDL3 (250 μg of protein) in a final volume of 400 μl at 37°C for 1 h. Vesicles were subsequently precipitated by the addition of 300 μl of a solution of 500 mM NaCl, 215 mM MnCl2, 445 units/ml heparin, and the radioactivity of a 500-μl aliquot of the supernatant was measured. C57BL/6 mouse (males, 25-30 g, n = 6) had free access to food and water. They were fed either the high cholesterol, high fat diet (20% coconut oil, 1% cholesterol from Research Diets Inc. New Bruswick, NJ) or a standard laboratory diet (Purina Laboratory rodent chow 5001) for 1 week before being sacrificed. C57BL/6 mouse (males, 25-30 g, n = 6) had free access to food and water. They were fed a standard laboratory diet (Chow 5001). Lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0127:B8, from Difco) was suspended in sterile saline. Stock lipopolysaccharide was sonicated and diluted just before use, at a dosage of 50 μg/animal. After 15 h, the animals were sacrificed. Differences between groups were tested by Student's t test. All analyses were performed with the Statworks® software. Significance levels given are those for the two-tailed test. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Significant results were with p < 0.01 unless otherwise stated. Although mice have negligible or no CETP activity, their PLTP activity is present. We measured PLTP activity in mice of three different strains. The PLTP activity in C57BL/6, C3H, and BALB/C mice were 220% (±15%), 205% (±10%), and 155% (±20%) of human plasma activity, respectively (n = 6 for each group). The mouse PLTP cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of lung cDNA using degenerate primers based on the human PLTP cDNA sequence(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E.

The cDNA sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse PLTP are shown in Fig. 1. Both mouse and human PLTP leader sequences are 17 amino acids in length with 9 identical amino acids, conforming to the pattern of similarity among the signal sequences of PLTP, CETP, lipoprotein lipase, and apolipoproteins A-I, and A-IV that was described previously(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol.

Like human PLTP, the predicted mature mouse PLTP is 476 amino acids long with an 83% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1). At the nucleotide sequence level, the identity in the translated regions of the human and mouse genes is 86%, while the 3′-untranslated regions are divergent. We determined the tissue distribution of PLTP mRNA in mouse (strain C57BL/6) by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Hybridization of a PLTP probe to poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from various mouse tissues indicated the existence of a single transcript of approximately 1.8 kilobases, similar in length to that of human(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another set of analyses, we used the RNase protection assay to measure PLTP mRNA concentration in lung, adipose tissue, and testis (Fig. 2C). The order of PLTP mRNA abundance is as follows: lung > adipose tissue, placenta > testis > brain > muscle > heart > kidney > liver > spleen. Because of the striking levels of PLTP mRNA expression in mouse adipose tissue, we investigated whether PLTP was also expressed in human adipose tissue. Human adipose tissue (from the heart) shows approximately 5 times as much PLTP mRNA expression as that seen in the heart (Fig. 3). In order to evaluate the effects of lipopolysaccharide on PLTP gene expression, lipopolysaccharide was injected into mice at 50 μg/animal. This resulted in a marked decrease in plasma PLTP activity and profound reductions of PLTP mRNA in lung, adipose tissue, and liver (Fig. 4). In order to evaluate the effects of altered PLTP gene expression on the plasma lipoprotein response to lipopolysaccharide, we measured plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. Lipopolysaccharide-treated animals had significantly higher HDL phospholipids and HDL cholesterol than controls (Table 1). Analysis by fast protein liquid chromatograph gel filtration of pooled mouse (n = 6) plasmas confirmed these observations (data not shown). By nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, the HDL particles isolated by ultracentrifugation were increased in size (from ∼10.2 to ∼10.9 nm). However, apoA-I levels in such HDL from lipopolysaccharide-treated and control animals were unchanged while apoE was increased, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Although there was an increase of plasma triglyceride concentration, this did not reach statistical significance probably because of the low lipopolysaccharide dose used. The effect of lipopolysaccharide on PLTP plasma activity was not due to an interaction of lipopolysaccharide with PLTP because in an in vitro assay with mouse plasma there was no direct inhibition of transfer activity at lipopolysaccharide concentrations up to 0.3 μg/μl. We also verified that the amount of lipopolysaccharide used in the assay system did not influence the lipoprotein precipitability by heparin-Mn2+.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In order to determine whether there are alterations in PLTP activity and mRNA levels in response to dietary fat and cholesterol, mice were fed for 1 week a diet containing 20% coconut oil and 1% cholesterol, which has previously been shown to significantly increase CETP activity and mRNA in CETP transgenic mice (17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, plasma PLTP activity was significantly increased (35%) in response to the high fat and cholesterol diet (Fig. 5), but the increase of PLTP mRNA was observed only in lung, not in liver and adipose tissue (Fig. 5). The HDL-phospholipids and HDL-cholesterol were increased ∼18 and ∼50% respectively, while the cholesterol and phospholipid levels of the very low density and low density lipoprotein fraction was increased ∼300 and ∼60%, respectively (Table 1). We have shown in this study that mouse and human PLTP have similar sequence and similar tissue distribution of mRNA production. The plasma activity is 1.5-2 times human levels. These findings suggest that the mouse will have utility as a model organism to study the role of PLTP in lipid metabolism. In mouse, as in human, extrahepatic tissues contribute to a large fraction of total PLTP mRNA production. It is likely that production of PLTP in these tissues is important in regulating phospholipid transfer to and from these tissues. Lung, adipose tissue, and testis were the tissues with the highest levels of PLTP expression. Although its PLTP expression ranks low among the tissues studied here, the large mass of liver means that this organ produces an appreciable amount of PLTP mRNA. Thus liver, adipose tissue and lung likely contribute to most of the total circulating PLTP mass. PLTP belongs to LBP gene family(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has its own distinct structure, function, and regulatory patterns. Although evolutionarily PLTP is more similar to LBP and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein than to CETP(10Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), functionally it is more similar to CETP in that both transfer phospholipids between lipoproteins(9Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1255-1274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In its regulation by lipopolysaccharide, PLTP is also more similar to CETP than to LBP and bactericidal/permeability increasing protein since this agent down-regulates expression of both proteins. PLTP mRNA levels are responsive to dietary cholesterol, but the -fold increase and tissue-specific up-regulation are different from CETP (see below). Unlike CETP, whose cholestyl ester transfer activity is inhibitable by lipopolysaccharide(15Masucci-Magoulas L. Moulin P. Jiang X.-C. Richardson H. Walsh A.M. Breslow J. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), PLTP activity is not inhibited by lipopolysaccharide. The regulatory mechanisms of PLTP appear to have differentiated during evolution from those of its family members so as to adapt to this protein's unique function. The 35% increase in plasma PLTP activity in response to dietary cholesterol and fat is not comparable to the 5-10-fold increase observed with CETP in CETP transgenic mice(17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it is statistically significant (p < 0.02). A similar up-regulation is seen in rabbits in which, after administration of a cholesterol (0.15%) diet, PLTP activity is increased 12 and 50% depending on whether they are hyporesponsive and hyperresponsive to cholesterol, respectively(22Meijer G.W. Demacker P.N.M. Van Tol A. Groener J.E.M. Van Der Palen J.G.P. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Van Zutphen L.M.F. Beynen A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also different from CETP regulation by cholesterol that occurs in most tissues(17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon D.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 3357-3363Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar), PLTP mRNA level is up-regulated by cholesterol diet in lung but not in adipose tissue and liver. This would suggest that cholesterol up-regulatory transcription factors must have different interactions with tissue-specific factors for these two genes. In this study, we found the HDL cholesterol and HDL phospholipid levels in mice treated with lipopolysaccharide were significantly elevated. These changes were due to an increase in HDL surface area rather than HDL particle number, because HDL size was increased while apoA-I content was not altered. HDL has been shown to be protective against endotoxic shock by binding lipopolysaccharide(24Levine D.L. Parker T.S. Donnely T.M. Walsh A. Rubin A.L. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12040-12044Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This is likely an adaptive response for the lipopolysaccharide-treated animal since larger HDL surface area would have greater lipopolysaccharide binding capacity/HDL particle(25Ulevitch R.J. Johnston A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide treatment causes complex changes in lipoprotein metabolism resulting in large changes in lipoprotein profile. Many enzymes involved in HDL metabolism are influenced by lipopolysaccharide treatment; there are increases in serum amyloid protein (26Hoffman J.S. Benditt E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and probably hepatic lipase (27Jansen H. van Tol A. Auwerx J. Skretting G. Staels B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Ettinger W.H. Miller L.A. Smith T.K. Parks J.S. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and decreases in lipoprotein lipase(29Bagby G.J. Spitzer J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: H325-H330Google Scholar), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase(27Jansen H. van Tol A. Auwerx J. Skretting G. Staels B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), CETP (in animals with CETP activity(15Masucci-Magoulas L. Moulin P. Jiang X.-C. Richardson H. Walsh A.M. Breslow J. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) and, as shown in this study, PLTP. Of these changes, none of them except that of PLTP could possibly increase HDL phospholipid. Thus, the increased HDL phospholipid that we observe here is likely due to decreased phospholipid transfer by PLTP from HDL. The decreased PLTP levels appear to play an important role in the altered quantities, sizes, and lipid distribution of lipoproteins during acute phase. It is interesting to note that a dietary cholesterol and lipopolysaccharide treatment similarly regulate PLTP in mice and CETP in CETP transgenic mice(15Masucci-Magoulas L. Moulin P. Jiang X.-C. Richardson H. Walsh A.M. Breslow J. Tall A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Jiang X.-C. Agellon L.B. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, these two proteins are induced in obese people by 15 and 35%, respectively, relative to nonobese people(30Dullaart R.P.F. Sluiter W.J. Dikkeschei L.D. Hoogenberg K. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Also, it has been reported that cigarette smoking increases CETP and PLTP activities by 18 and 8%, respectively(31Dullaart R.P.F. Hoogenberg K. Dikkeschei B.D. van Tol A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1581-1585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correlation in CETP and PLTP activities may be due to the fact that removal of either cholesterol or phospholipid from a lipid membrane would disrupt an optimal phospholipid/cholesterol ratio. This disruption caused by removal of phospholipid by PLTP can be corrected either by a concomitant removal of cholesterol (which would result in decreased surface area) or an influx of phospholipid from another source. One mechanism by which cholesterol removal could accompany phospholipid transfer is the coordinate action of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and CETP. Another possible reason for the correlation of PLTP and CETP activities may be that processes that lead to a change in the surface area of lipoproteins would need to be coupled to mechanisms that change the core volume, either by neutral lipid transfer by CETP or by lipolysis. Whichever of these mechanisms is operating, phospholipid transfer can be expected to be interrelated with phospholipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since mice and rats do not have significant CETP activity it should be of interest to determine what alternative mechanisms of cholesterol removal are coupled to PLTP activity in these animals. It is interesting to find that adipose tissue express PLTP mRNA at high levels in mice and humans. Adipose tissue also is a major site for CETP synthesis(32Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E. Goldberg I.J. Yacoub L.K. Agellon L.B. Compton D. Schnitzer-Polokoff R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4631-4639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In hamster, a strong inverse correlation of adipose tissue CETP mRNA levels with the concentration of HDL cholesteryl esters suggests a role for locally synthesized CETP in the metabolism of HDL cholesteryl esters(32Jiang X.C. Moulin P. Quinet E. Goldberg I.J. Yacoub L.K. Agellon L.B. Compton D. Schnitzer-Polokoff R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4631-4639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Locally synthesized PLTP in adipose tissue may also be involved in HDL metabolism, since CETP and PLTP activities are correlated in obese humans(30Dullaart R.P.F. Sluiter W.J. Dikkeschei L.D. Hoogenberg K. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 24: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Adipose tissue is also a major site for lipoprotein lipase synthesis(33Garfinkel A. Schotz M.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Plasma Lipoprotein. Elsevier Science Publishing Company, Inc., New York1987: 335-357Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that PLTP mediates the transfer and exchange of phospholipids between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and HDL during lipolysis(5Tall A.R. Krumholz S. Olivecrona T. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 842-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a possible coordinated action of lipoprotein lipase and PLTP. Since PLTP, CETP, and lipoprotein lipase are highly expressed in the same tissues and together they play important roles in lipoprotein remodeling, their coordinated action in adipose tissue deserves further study. In mice and humans, lung is a major tissue expressing PLTP mRNA. This suggests an important function of PLTP in the lung, most likely in surfactant production and metabolism. It was recently reported that HDL and LDL could stimulate primary cultures of type II pneumocytes to secrete phospholipids(34Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Dobbs L.G. Erickson S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4256-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PLTP may facilitate uptake of secreted phospholipid by HDL in the interstitial fluid of the lung, as well as subsequent deposition of phospholipid into the alveolar membrane. Because lung was the only tissue among those examined that increased PLTP expression (∼100%) in response to a high fat and cholesterol diet and this was accompanied by a significant increase (∼30%) in plasma PLTP activity, this organ must be contributing significant amounts of plasma PLTP. It has been suggested that PLTP is involved in the provision of substrate for lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase and/or transferring phospholipid-rich surface fragments from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins to HDL during catalyzed lipolysis(5Tall A.R. Krumholz S. Olivecrona T. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 842-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. that PLTP promotes HDL formation or increases HDL-phospholipid concentration. On the other hand, there is evidence from rats suggesting that PLTP enables either an increased uptake of HDL-phospholipid by tissues or an increased clearance of HDL particles(8Pownall H.J. Hickson-Bick D. Maassay J.B. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whether PLTP activity leads to a net transfer into or out of HDL seems to depend on the physiological context. Our findings in this study also suggest the same, because although HDL phospholipid and HDL cholesterol increased in both lipopolysaccharide-treated animals and animals on a cholesterol diet, we find that the levels of PLTP under these two treatments change in opposite directions. Since the phospholipid contents of LDL+VLDL were essentially unchanged, the changes in PLTP levels must have influenced primarily the phospholipid fluxes to and from tissues. In a high fat and cholesterol diet, it may be advantageous for the animal to increase the phospholipid flow into tissues by increasing PLTP levels. Conversely, with lipopolysaccharide treatment, it may be more advantageous to limit phospholipid flow between HDL and tissues by decreasing PLTP concentrations. Because lipopolysaccharide treatment and dietary fat and cholesterol have complex effects, the understanding of the role that PLTP plays in lipid metabolism will have to await the study of animals whose PLTP expression is specifically altered. However, it appears likely that HDL-phospholipid levels are determined both by PLTP levels and by gradients of phospholipid concentration between HDL and other phospholipid sources. We thank Dr. Alan Tall for his invaluable guidance and discussions which have made this work possible. The human heart and human adipose tissue samples were generous gifts from Dr. Jie Wang."

Further, although it is well known that scuPA binds to a specific extracellular urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, the effect of this interaction on the enzymatic activity of scuPA has not been described. In the present paper we report that the binding of scuPA to cellular and to recombinant soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptors (suPAR) increases its catalytic activity as measured by the cleavage of a urokinase-specific chromogenic substrate. suPAR increased the Vmax of scuPA 5-fold with little change in its Km. suPAR also stimulated the plasminogen activator activity of scuPA by decreasing its Km for Glu-plasminogen from 1.15 μM to 0.022 μM and by increasing the kcat of this reaction from 0.0015 to 0.022 s−1. Preincubation of scuPA with suPAR also enhances its susceptibility to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, consistent with exposure of its catalytic site.

Enhancement of scuPA activity by suPAR is both prevented and reversed by its amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-135), which competes for receptor binding, suggesting that continued binding to the receptor is required for expression of scuPA's enzymatic activity.

Although the capacity of plasmin and tcuPA to mutually reinforce the production of each other is well established, the initial steps in the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin are less clear.The cell surface may regulate these initial steps by providing specific binding sites for urokinase and plasminogen. Several groups have reported that the binding of scuPA to uPAR in the presence of plasminogen markedly accelerates plasmin formation(3Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol.

Plasmin formation is also accelerated in systems where the scuPA has been linked directly to the cell surface by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor (6Lee S.W. Ellis V. Dichek D.A. J. Biol.

Based on these data, it has been postulated that the enhancement of plasmin generation may be a consequence of the increased local concentration of single-chain urokinase (scuPA) and plasminogen on cell surfaces relative to plasma(6Lee S.W. Ellis V. Dichek D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2411-2418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).However, it is also possible that cell surface receptors may modulate the induction or stability of critical intermediates in plasmin formation, which have been described to date only in fluid phase systems.

In addition, a transitional state of scuPA has been described to occur after it has been cleaved by plasmin or kallikrein in which the molecule has greater catalytic efficacy against Glu-plasminogen than does tcuPA(11Liu J. Pannell R. Gurewich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15289-15292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Despite these observations, soluble scuPA is generally considered to contribute little to plasminogen activator activity relative to tcuPA in most settings. However, there may be specific circumstances in which the intrinsic enzymatic activity of scuPA is enhanced. In this study, we asked whether the binding of scuPA to its receptor (uPAR) is one such situation. Our studies indicate that binding of scuPA to soluble uPAR is sufficient to expose the catalytic site of scuPA and cause an approximately 50-fold reduction in its Km and an approximately 850-fold increase in its catalytic efficiency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsscuPA and its amino-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-132) and recombinant soluble uPA receptor were prepared and isolated as described(4Barnathan E.S.

The chromogenic substrate of urokinase, Spectrozyme UK (carbobenzoxy-L-γ-glutamyl-(α-t-butoxyl)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide diacetate salt), Glu-plasminogen, Lys-plasminogen, the chromogenic substrate of plasmin, Spectrozyme PL (H-D-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysine-p-nitroanilide diacetate salt), plasmin, and high molecular weight two-chain urokinase were provided by American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). α2-Antiplasmin was obtained from Sigma.Variant scuPAThe cDNA for scuPA-Glu158 (kindly supplied by Dr. H. R. Lijnen, Leuven, Belgium) (14Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Holmes W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5682-5689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the HindIII site of pcDNA 3 (Invitrogen) and amplified in DH5 cells, and its nucleotide sequence was verified (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Transient transfection in COS-7 cells was performed using DEAE-dextran. Cell supernatants were collected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mM benzamidine. scuPA-Glu158 was isolated by affinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody directed at its kringle immobilized on Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). scuPA-Glu158 migrated as a single 55-kDa protein on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions before and after incubation with plasmin-Sepharose, whereas native scuPA migrated as a 33- and a 20-kDa protein after the same exposure to plasmin. No scuPA was detected in supernatants from COS cells transfected with vector alone. Purified scuPA-Glu158 was then incubated sequentially with plasmin-Sepharose, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone prior to use as described (5Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to eliminate any native scuPA that might have been present but have gone undetected.Measurement of scuPA Amidolytic ActivityThe amidolytic activity of scuPA was monitored by the release of p-nitroaniline from Spectrozyme UK, measured by the rate of change in light absorbance at 405 nm. The reaction mixture contained 60 nM scuPA and 58 μM Spectrozyme UK in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. In some experiments equimolar concentrations of suPAR (60 nM) were added simultaneously with scuPA and the chromogenic substrate, whereas in others scuPA and suPAR were preincubated for various times before the chromogenic substrate was added. The reaction was monitored continuously for the indicated times, and the reaction rate (Vmax) and the Km were calculated from the linear portions of the activity curves as described(15Higazi A.A. Finci-Yeheskel Z. Samara A.A. Aziza R. Mayer M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 863-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The amidolytic activity induced by the binding of scuPA to its receptor was also determined on cell surfaces. First trimester human trophoblastic cells were obtained and characterized as described previously(16Diss E.M. Gabbe S.G. Moore J.W. Kniss D.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1992; 167: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures grown in 48-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 5 min with glycine buffer, pH 3, to elute endogenous uPA, and washed two additional times. The cells were then incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 300 μM Spectrozyme UK and 10 mM aprotinin in the presence and the absence of 10 nM scuPA for 3 h at 37°C, and the A405nm was determined. In other experiments, the incubation was performed in an identical manner in the presence of scuPA and ATF (100 nM).Measurement of Plasminogen Activator ActivityThe plasminogen activator activity of scuPA and scuPA-Glu158 were measured in the presence of plasminogen using the plasmin substrate Spectrozyme PL. 2 nM scuPA or 1 nM scuPA-Glu158 were preincubated with or without equimolar concentrations of suPAR for 50 min. 1 μM Glu- or Lys-plasminogen and 500 μM chromogenic substrate were added in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for various periods of time, and the reaction was monitored at 405 nm. A high concentration of the chromogenic substrate (1724-fold higher than the Km) was used to minimize activation of scuPA by plasmin and thereby isolate the stimulatory effect of suPAR. In one set of experiments, scuPA alone or scuPA and suPAR were preincubated for 50 min before plasminogen and the chromogenic substrate were added. In another set of experiments, 10-fold molar excess ATF was added to preformed suPAR♦scuPA complexes immediately prior to or 4 min after adding plasminogen and the chromogenic substrate.Kinetic analysis of plasminogen activation was performed as described (17Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 nM scuPA in the presence and the absence of an equimolar concentration of suPAR was incubated with increasing concentrations of Glu-plasminogen and 500 μM amidolytic substrate of plasmin in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature, and the A405nm was measured continuously over time. The A405nm generated in the absence of added scuPA at each time point determined in parallel was subtracted. The concentration of plasmin generated during each interval was calculated from the rate of change in A405nm using a standard curve made with known concentrations of plasmin. The kinetic parameters of plasmin generation were then determined using a double-reciprocal plot of the rates of plasmin generation versus plasminogen concentration(17Ellis V. Behrendt N. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Effect of PAI-1, ATF, and α2-AntiplasminIn some experiments, 400-600 nM ATF or 200 nM α2-antiplasmin were added to scuPA alone or to preformed suPAR♦scuPA complexes during the preincubation step. To test the reversibility of the reaction, scuPA and suPAR were preincubated for 50 min as above and 10-fold molar excess ATF was then added for 0-60 min before the amidolytic activity was measured. In other experiments, 120 nM PAI-1 was incubated with scuPA or with preformed suPAR♦scuPA complexes for 5 min before the chromogenic substrate was added.Gel ElectrophoresisSamples of 200 nM scuPA alone, 40 nM suPAR alone, or 200 nM scuPA preincubated with equimolar concentrations of suPAR for either 60 min or 24 h at 37°C were mixed with equal volumes of 10% SDS and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol. The mixture was heated at 100°C for 5 min. 20-μl aliquots were then applied to a 10% SDS/12% polyacrylamide gel(18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar), and the protein bands were identified by staining with Coomassie blue.RESULTSSoluble uPAR augments the enzymatic activity of scuPA, as measured by the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme UK (Fig. 1). The expression of enzymatic activity by scuPA in the presence of its receptor followed a time-dependent pattern in which three phases could be discerned (Fig. 1, inset). When suPAR, scuPA, and the chromogenic substrate were added contemporaneously, no amidolytic activity was detectable for the first 19 min, after which the enzymatic activity was stimulated approximately 220% compared with scuPA alone. Beginning at approximately 50 min, an additional 2-fold increase in the velocity of the reaction became evident.We hypothesized that this lag phase reflects the time required for scuPA within the suPAR♦scuPA complex to undergo structural isomerization to a more active form. To examine this possibility, scuPA was preincubated with suPAR for 50 min prior to adding chromogenic substrate. Under these conditions, the amidolytic activity was evident immediately (Fig. 2), and the velocity of the reaction was similar to the third phase of activity seen when the preincubation step was omitted (Fig. 2, inset). The third phase of activity was linear and stable over time, because incubating scuPA with suPAR in the presence and the absence of substrate for longer periods did not enhance its activity further. The enzyme kinetic properties were then studied in greater detail under the conditions of preincubation. The Vmax of scuPA preincubated with suPAR for the chromogenic substrate increased more than 5-fold, whereas the Km increased only ∼30% compared with the activity of scuPA alone (Fig. 3, A and B).Figure 2:Preincubation of scuPA with suPAR stimulates its amidolytic activity. 60 nM scuPA was preincubated with (♦) or without (⊡) equimolar concentrations of suPAR for 50 min before the addition of the urokinase chromogenic substrate as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments is shown. Inset, the third phase of the amidolytic activity of suPAR♦scuPA complexes shown in Fig. 1(top curve) is compared with the activity measured after preincubation of scuPA with suPAR (Fig. 2, bottom curve).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Kinetics of scuPA activation by suPAR.

B, analysis of the data presented in A using a double-reciprocal plot. The results from one of two such experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined whether suPAR also stimulated the plasminogen activator activity of scuPA using its physiologic substrates Glu- and Lys-plasminogen. Kinetic analysis of plasminogen activator activity shows that the interaction of scuPA with suPAR decreases its Km toward Glu-plasminogen from 1.15 to 0.022 μM and increases the kcat from 0.0015 to 0.022 s−1. This corresponds to an increase in enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) from 0.0013 to 1.1 μM−1 s−1 (Fig. 4). At approximate physiologic concentrations of scuPA (2 nM) and Glu-plasminogen (1 μM), suPAR increased the PA activity 79.3-fold at 16.5 min compared with scuPA alone (Fig. 5A). Lys-plasminogen was cleaved more efficiently by scuPA than was Glu-plasminogen (Fig. 5B), as expected(10Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the plasminogen activator activity of scuPA for Lys-plasminogen was enhanced 8.9-fold following preincubation with suPAR under the same experimental conditions described for Glu-plasminogen (Fig. 5B).Figure 4:Effect of suPAR on the kinetics of Glu-plasminogen activation by scuPA. A, 10 nM scuPA was incubated with varying concentrations of Glu-plasminogen (0.1-0.65 μM). The initial rates of plasmin generation, determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were plotted against plasminogen concentration as a double-reciprocal plot. B, 10 nM scuPA was incubated with equimolar concentrations of suPAR and varying concentrations of Glu-plasminogen (0.004-0.030 μM), and the data were analyzed as above. In both panels, the results of an experiment representative of two so performed are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:suPAR stimulates the plasminogen activator activity of scuPA.

The mean ± S.D. of five separate experiments is shown. B, the experiment was performed as described in A except that 1 μM Lys-plasminogen was used as the substrate instead of Glu-plasminogen. The mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The next series of experiments was performed to determine whether this stimulation of scuPA activity by suPAR was indeed dependent on persistent binding to its receptor, required only initial contact between scuPA and suPAR, or was the result of its conversion to two-chain urokinase by enzymes such as plasmin. First, we examined the effect of ATF, which competes for receptor binding but has no enzymatic activity. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the presence of ATF during the preincubation step totally prevented the stimulatory effect of suPAR on the amidolytic activity of scuPA. Second, in contrast, α2-antiplasmin had no inhibitory effect, excluding contamination of either preparation by plasmin. Third, the expression of amidolytic activity was not due to the conversion of scuPA to tcuPA by another enzyme (Fig. 7A). Rather, scuPA remained as a single-chain molecule throughout the experiment, and no two-chain uPA was detected even when incubations were continued for as long as 24 h (Fig. 7B). Fourth, the enhancement of the amidolytic activity of scuPA by suPAR was totally reversible, because it was abolished by ATF even when added 50 min after suPAR♦scuPA complexes had been allowed to form (Fig. 8). ATF also abolished the stimulatory effect of suPAR on scuPA activity using Glu-plasminogen as the substrate (Fig. 9). Fifth, to address the possibility that ATF might have inhibited scuPA activation to tcuPA by an unknown mechanism, we added ATF after the stimulatory effect of suPAR had begun. When ATF was added to suPAR♦scuPA complexes 20 min after the addition of the urokinase chromogenic substrate, the amidolytic activity was suppressed to the level seen with scuPA alone (Fig. 8). Further, when ATF was added 4 min after the addition of suPAR♦scuPA to Glu-plasminogen at a point when plasmin formation had already begun, the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate of plasmin became linear over time. The latter result is consistent with ATF preventing further stimulation of plasmin formation by suPAR♦scuPA. In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, neither ATF, suPAR, nor a combination of ATF and suPAR affected the amidolytic or PA activity of two-chain urokinase or the enzymatic activity of plasmin over 1 h (not shown), indicating that the inhibition of scuPA activity described above was due to competition for binding to suPAR. Finally, to further exclude any possible contribution of plasmin-mediated conversion of scuPA to tcuPA, we analyzed the capacity of suPAR to augment the PA activity of a variant scuPA (scuPA-Glu158) that cannot be cleaved by plasmin(5Manchanda N. Schwartz B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Holmes W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5682-5689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). suPAR stimulated the PA activity of the mutant scuPA approximately 115-fold in the presence of 1 mM Glu-plasminogen (not shown).Figure 6:ATF inhibits the stimulation of scuPA amidolytic activity by suPAR. 60 nM scuPA was incubated for 50 min alone (open bar), with equimolar concentrations of suPAR (bar with dots), with suPAR and 6.6-fold molar excess ATF (bar with squares), or with suPAR and 200 nM α2-antiplasmin (hatched bar).

In these experiments 10 μM aprotinin was added to prevent endogenous serine protease activity that might be directed at either scuPA itself or its substrate. In the absence of added scuPA, no amidolytic activity was detected. Addition of scuPA to the cells stimulated its PA activity approximately 6-fold (not shown). This stimulation was almost completely (>90%) inhibited by the addition of ATF, showing that binding of scuPA to cellular uPAR was required.It has been reported that PAI-1 shows an approximate 40% reduction in its capacity to inhibit tcuPA bound to its cellular receptor compared with the free enzyme(19Ellis V. Wun T.-C. Behrendt N. Ronne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9904-9908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the capacity of PAI-1 to inhibit the intrinsic activity expressed by scuPA and scuPA bound to suPAR. As shown in Fig. 10, the amidolytic activity of suPAR♦scuPA complexes was totally inhibited by a 3-fold molar excess of PAI-1, whereas scuPA was virtually insensitive to inhibition under the same conditions.Figure 10:Inhibition of scuPA and scuPA♦suPAR by PAI-1.

They all possess an isoform of a phylogenetically very conserved catalytic subunit (PP-1C), which displays some unique properties that readily allow differentiation from other protein phosphatases. For example, only type 1 protein phosphatases are inhibited by specific cytoplasmic (inhibitor-1, inhibitor-2, DARPP-32) and nuclear (NIPP-1) polypeptides. Also, with phosphorylase as substrate, the known PP-1 holoenzymes are activated by limited trypsinolysis. This can be explained by the destruction of inhibitory noncatalytic polypeptide(s), resulting in the release of the catalytic subunit.

This targeting role explains the broad subcellular distribution of PP-1 and forms the basis for the nomenclature of PP-1 holoenzymes. It is now firmly established that unique species of PP-1 are associated with glycogen (PP-1G), myofibrils (PP-1M), and in the liver also with the endoplasmic reticulum (PP-1E). A minor fraction of PP-1 is soluble (PP-1S). By far the highest concentration of PP-1, however, is found in the nucleus (PP-1N), where it can be found both in the nucleoplasm and associated with particulate structures like chromatin(4Bollen M. Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1993; 7: 31-47Google Scholar). Although there is convincing genetic and biochemical evidence for a role of PP-1N in nuclear processes like (alternative) pre-mRNA splicing, chromatin condensation, and gene expression, the exact substrates remain largely to be identified(4Bollen M.

We have started to analyze the properties and regulation of PP-1N in rat liver nuclei and report here on the existence of at least two species of PP-1N with regulatory subunits of 41 and 111 kDa, respectively. The 41-kDa polypeptide is shown to represent the native form of hepatic NIPP-1. We also provide evidence for a physiological regulation of NIPP-1 by reversible phosphorylation. PP-1C(17DeGuzman A.

Protein kinase p34cdc2 was purified from Xenopus oocytes by affinity chromatography on p13-Sepharose(21Agostinis P. Derua R. Sarno S. Goris J. Merlevede W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The recombinant α-, γ1-, γ2-, and δ-isoforms of rat PP-1C(22Zhang Z. Bai G. Shima M. Zhao S. Nagao M. Lee E.Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Prof. E. Y. C. Lee (University of Miami, Miami, FL). Casein was prepared according to the procedure of Mercier et al.(23Mercier J.C. Maubois J.L. Poznanski S. Ribadeau-Dumas B. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1968; 50: 521-530PubMed Google Scholar). Histone IIA, myelin basic protein, catalytic subunit of PKA from beef heart and PP-2B from bovine brain were purchased from Sigma. Histone H1 and the digoxygenin (DIG) protein labeling and detection kit were obtained from Boehringer. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon) were purchased from Millipore. Protein A coupled to TSK® beads, and Affi-T-agarose, used for the purification of immunoglobulins, were obtained from Affiland (Liège, Belgium). A kit for the development of Western blots by enhanced chemiluminescence was purchased from Amersham Corp. Phosphorylase b was phosphorylated in the presence of [32P]ATP by purified phosphorylase kinase(24Antoniw J.F. Nimmo H.G. Yeaman S.J. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1977; 162: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Casein, myelin basic protein, and histone IIA were phosphorylated by PKA(10Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and histone H1 was phosphorylated by p34cdc2(21Agostinis P. Derua R. Sarno S. Goris J. Merlevede W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For the preparation of digoxygenin-labeled PP-1C, 200 μl of purified catalytic subunit (0.5 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 50 mM sodium tetraborate at pH 8.5 plus 1 mM dithiothreitol, and incubated with 15 μl of digoxygenin-carboxymethyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was extensively dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 60% glycerol. All experiments were performed with normally fed female Wistar rats of about 250 g. Unless indicated otherwise, the animals were sacrificed by decapitation. To check whether phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by PKA also occurs in vivo (see Fig. 7), the animals were first injected intraperitoneally with propranolol (1 mg in 0.2 ml of saline) plus glucose (1 g in 3 ml of saline). 30 min later, the activity of liver PKA was enhanced by the intraperitoneal injection of glucagon (0.3 mg in 0.2 ml of saline). 15 min before excision of the liver, the animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (12 mg in 0.2 ml of saline). In this experiment, nuclei were prepared in the presence of 40 mM NaF and 0.2 μM microcystin to prevent dephosphorylation of NIPP-1. Unless indicated otherwise, all purification and fractionation buffers were supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors including 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), 50 μML-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and 5 μM leupeptin. Liver nuclei were prepared according to the method of Blobel and Potter(25Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, livers were homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer A containing 15 mM PIPES/NaOH at pH 7.2, 80 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.25 M sucrose. The homogenate was mixed with 2 volumes of buffer A containing 2.3 M instead of 0.25 M sucrose, and put on top of 1 volume of the same buffer. After high speed centrifugation (120,000 × g for 30 min), the pelleted nuclei were resuspended with a Dounce homogenizer (A pestle) in buffer B, containing 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.25 M sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After standing on ice for 10 min, enabling the complete solubilization of the outer nuclear membrane, the nuclear suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 3,500 × g. The nuclear pellet was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle) in a hypotonic solution (buffer C) containing 50 mM glycylglycine/NaOH at pH 7.4, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and the lysed nuclei were submitted to centrifugation during 5 min at 13,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in buffer C plus 0.3 M NaCl, incubated for 30 min at 4°C, and centrifuged during 5 min at 13,000 × g. The latter supernatant is further referred to as “nuclear extract.” The protocol was based on the procedure described by Alessi et al.(26Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, following SDS-PAGE (10%), the separated polypeptides were blotted onto Immobilon membranes and incubated for 3 h at room temperature with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5% skim milk powder. Subsequently, the blots were incubated for 3 h in 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and a 1:1000 dilution of DIG-labeled PP-1C. Finally, the free DIG-PP-1C was washed away, and the bound phosphatase was detected with DIG-specific antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide encompassing the carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 302-322) of the δ-isoform of PP-1C were kindly donated by Prof. A. A. DePaoli-Roach (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). Antibodies against a synthetic peptide encompassing the 11 carboxyl-terminal residues of NIPP-1 from bovine thymus were raised in a rabbit and purified by chromatography on Affi-T-agarose. For Western blotting, incubation with the antisera was done for 2 h at room temperature at a final dilution of 1:2000, and the peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. For immunoprecipitation of PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111, 300 μl of the Mono Q peak fractions (see “Results”) were first incubated with the PP-1CS antiserum (final dilution of 1:60) or with Affi-T-purified NIPP-1 antibodies (final concentration of 30 μg/ml) during 45 min at 4°C. Subsequently, 30 μl of protein-A-TSK® was added, and the mixture was rotated during 30 min at 4°C. Following centrifugation (1 min at 10,000 × g), the pellet was first washed in 0.5 ml of a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.25 M LiCl and then washed twice in 1 ml of the same buffer without LiCl. The supernatant and resuspended pellet were assayed for spontaneous and trypsin-revealed phosphorylase phosphatase activities. An aliquot of these fractions was boiled in SDS-sample buffer and centrifuged (1 min at 10,000 × g), and the supernatant was checked for binding of DIG-PP-1C following denaturing electrophoresis and blotting. The spontaneous and trypsin-revealed protein phosphatase activities were measured as described previously(10Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of phosphatase releases 1 nmol of phosphate/min at 30°C. Heat-stable inhibitory polypeptides of PP-1C were assayed using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate. Following a heat treatment (3 min at 90°C), the inhibitory activity was assayed before and after preincubation of the fractions with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml during 5 min). The difference between both assays was taken as protein-derived inhibitory activity. Since all known species of PP-1 can dephosphorylate phosphorylase a, we have chosen this substrate for the initial characterization of PP-1N. Although the phosphorylase phosphatase activity was very low in freshly prepared liver nuclei, the activity was increased up to 40-fold by a preincubation of the nuclear fraction with trypsin (Fig. 1), which is known to release the catalytic subunit (see the Introduction). Both, the spontaneous and the trypsin-revealed activities could be nearly completely blocked by the addition of inhibitor-2 (not illustrated), showing that the activity stemmed virtually exclusively from PP-1. A large activation (5-25-fold) of PP-1N by trypsinolysis was also obtained after prior extraction of PP-1N with 0.3 M NaCl (see below). The spontaneous phosphorylase phosphatase activity gradually increased during incubation of the nuclei at 37°C in the presence of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride as sole protease inhibitor (Fig. 1). This increase was completely blocked by the addition of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, TPCK, and TLCK. In separate experiments, it was found that the addition of leupeptin alone was able to prevent completely the time-dependent increase in the spontaneous activity of PP-1N, while the addition of TPCK or TLCK was only partially effective (not illustrated). On the other hand, the trypsin-revealed phosphorylase phosphatase activity, which is a measure for the concentration of the catalytic subunit, remained constant during incubation with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride only. Since we had previously identified heat-stable inhibitory polypeptides of PP-1 (NIPP-1) in thymus nuclei(10Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether the presence of such inhibitor(s) could account for the low spontaneous activity of hepatic PP-1N. To our surprise, however, we found that freshly prepared liver nuclei contained very little or no heat-stable inhibitory activity of PP-1C, although such an inhibitory activity could be generated by simple incubation of the nuclei at 37°C (Fig. 2). Again, the generation of this heat-stable inhibitory activity was completely blocked by the addition of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, TLCK, and TPCK. Taken together, the above data suggest that the activity of PP-1C in the nucleus is suppressed by polypeptide(s) that are destroyed by trypsin. These inhibitory polypeptides seem also to be degraded by endogenous protease(s), which explains the gradual increase of the spontaneous phosphorylase phosphatase activity (Fig. 1). However, the endogenous proteases also generate some active heatstable inhibitor fragments (Fig. 2). Upon chromatography of a nuclear salt extract on Mono Q, the phosphorylase phosphatase activity eluted in two major peaks (Fig. 3A). The first peak, termed PP-1NR41, was nearly completely latent, but the activity could be revealed by a preincubation with trypsin, which results in the release of free catalytic subunit (see the Introduction). The second peak (PP-1NR111) was always partially active but could be additionally activated up to 5-fold by trypsin. The extent of activation of PP-1NR111 by trypsin varied among preparations and moreover decreased rapidly during storage of the fractions on ice or at −20°C. Although the addition of leupeptin, TPCK, and TLCK blocked the degradation of PP-1N during purification and incubation of liver nuclei (Fig. 1), these inhibitors failed to block proteolysis during further purification of PP-1N. Thus, efforts to purify PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111 until homogeneity failed and invariably resulted in the generation of free catalytic subunit. Problems with proteolysis were particularly pronounced for PP-1NR111 (see also below). For the identification of the noncatalytic subunits of PP-1N, we have therefore used an indirect method that is based upon the high affinity binding of DIG-labeled PP-1C to specific polypeptides, following SDS-PAGE (10%), and blotting of a nuclear extract. Using this approach, we could identify two major PP-1C-binding polypeptides of 41 ± 1 (n = 12) and 111 ± 2 kDa (n = 7), that coeluted during chromatraphy on Mono Q with PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111, respectively (Fig. 3B). That the 41- and 111-kDa polypeptides, further denoted as R41 and R111, were physically associated with the catalytic subunit is substantiated by their co-immunoprecipitation with PP-1C, using polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal domain of δ-isoform of the catalytic subunit (Fig. 3C). In agreement with the extreme sensitivity of R111 to proteolysis, we noted that this polypeptide was partially degraded to smaller fragments during immunoprecipitation which, however, were still able to bind DIG-PP-1C (Fig. 3C, lane2). It should also be noted that the immunoprecipitated PP-1N holoenzymes were still largely latent, as indicated by the severalfold increase of the phosphorylase phosphatase activity by a preincubation with trypsin (not illustrated). Since the recent cDNA cloning of NIPP-1 revealed that the inhibitor(s) purified from bovine thymus nuclei (16-18 kDa) were proteolytic fragments and that recombinant NIPP-1 migrated during SDS-PAGE (10%) as a protein of 41 kDa,2 2A. Van Eynde, S. Wera, M. Beullens, S. Torrekens, F. Van Leuven, W. Stalmans, and M. Bollen, unpublished data. we wondered whether R41 could be identical to NIPP-1. We indeed noted that in the Mono Q fractions containing PP-1NR41, a polypeptide of 41 kDa was detected by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal domain of NIPP-1 (not shown). This 41-kDa polypeptide was no longer detected when the primary antibodies were preincubated with an excess of the synthetic peptide to which the antibodies were generated. As is illustrated in Fig. 4, PP-1NR41 could be nearly quantitatively immunoprecipated with the NIPP-1 antibodies and in the immunoprecipitate R41 could be identified by labeling with DIG-PP-1C. Gel filtration on Superdex 75 showed that PP-1NR41 migrated as a protein of about 90 kDa (Fig. 5A). Combined with the above data, these results suggest that PP-1NR41 is a heterodimer between the catalytic subunit (37 kDa, see below) and NIPP-1. Gel filtration of PP-1NR111 always yielded at least two peaks of activity with apparent molecular masses of about 160 and 30-40 kDa (Fig. 5B). The first peak was largely latent and may represent a heterodimer of the catalytic subunit and R111. The second peak was fully active and is likely to be the free catalytic subunit, generated by proteolysis or dissociation of the noncatalytic subunit(s). The latter view is substantiated by findings that gel filtration of stored samples of PP-1NR111 exclusively yielded free catalytic subunit (not illustrated). There are five known mammalian isoforms of PP-1C(1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Walter G. Mumby M. Biochim.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), and it has been demonstrated that the α-, γ1-, and δ-isoforms are present in rat liver(27Goodwin G.H. Sanders C. Johns E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Western analysis with antibodies that rather specifically recognized the δ-isoform of PP-1C yielded a signal for both PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111 (Fig. 6). The presence of the δ-isoform is corroborated by findings that the two holoenzymes could be immunoprecipitated with these antibodies (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, the catalytic subunit of PP-1NR111 migrated as a slightly larger protein than recombinant PP-1CS and than the catalytic subunit of PP-1NR41. These differences may reflect a distinct posttranslational modification or the presence of two δ-isoforms generated, for example, by alternative splicing. Along the same line, it has been shown that there are two forms of PP-1Cα that only differ by the presence or absence of an amino-terminal 11-amino acid insert(16Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The above data imply that the noncatalytic subunit(s) of PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111 are inhibitory, using phosphorylase as substrate. Since the known regulatory subunits of the cytoplasmic species of PP-1 can be either inhibitory or stimulatory, depending on the substrate (1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Walter G. Mumby M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 207-226PubMed Google Scholar, 3DePaoli-Roach A.A. Park I.-K.

Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we have investigated whether this also applies to PP-1N. For that purpose, we have compared the effect of trypsinolysis of the nuclear holoenzymes on their activity toward various substrates (Table 1). Depending on the substrate, trypsinolysis of PP-1NR41 increased the phosphatase activity 2-13-fold. On the other hand, a preincubation of PP-1NR111 with trypsin only caused a 2-5-fold increase in the phosphatase activities toward phosphorylase, myelin basic protein, and histone H1 and had no effect on the casein and histone IIA phosphatase activities. Table 1 also shows that the activity of the catalytic subunit toward all investigated substrates was either not affected or only slightly increased by trypsinolysis, implying that the observed effects of trypsin on the nuclear holoenzymes are largely or completely due to the destruction of the noncatalytic subunit(s). In conclusion, our data suggest that NIPP-1 and R111 are, if anything, inhibitory to the dephosphorylation of the investigated substrates.TABLE I Open table in a new tab We have previously shown that the active fragments of NIPP-1 from bovine thymus show a decreased affinity for PP-1C after phosphorylation by protein kinase A or casein kinase-2(11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In agreement with this result we found that after incubation of hepatic PP-1NR41 with PKA under phosphorylating conditions and subsequent denaturing electrophoresis, NIPP-1 reproducibly bound less DIG-labeled catalytic subunit (Fig. 7, upperleftpanel). Interestingly, the remaining label was bound to a polypeptide, which migrated somewhat slower during SDS-PAGE, indicating that the electrophoretic mobility of NIPP-1 is decreased by phosphorylation with PKA. A lesser DIG-PP-1C labeling was also obtained after phosphorylation of blotted NIPP-1 with PKA. Subsequent incubation with PP-2AD and PP-2B restored binding of DIG-PP-1C, providing additional evidence that the observed effect was due to phosphorylation of NIPP-1 and not, for example, due to a binding of PKA or a (proteolytic) loss of NIPP-1. Incubation of PP-1NR41 or blotted hepatic NIPP-1 with casein kinase-2 under phosphorylating conditions did not affect the extent of binding of DIG-PP-1C to NIPP-1 (not shown). Although phosphorylation of native PP-1NR41 by PKA decreased the affinity of NIPP-1 for DIG-PP-1C, it did not affect the phosphorylase phosphatase activity (not shown), suggesting that the decrease in the affinity was not sufficient to cause a dissociation of the holoenzyme. However, a 2-4-fold increase in the phosphorylase phosphatase activity was detected after phosphorylation of partially purified PP-1NR41 with PKA or casein kinase-2 (not shown). This partially purified enzyme was obtained by consecutive chromatographies of a nuclear extract on Mono Q, heparin-Sepharose, and histone IIA-Sepharose (not illustrated), and was almost certainly a proteolyzed species, as indicated by observations that the associated NIPP-1 inhibitory activity was heat stable. We have also used the DIG-PP-1C-labeling method to investigate whether NIPP-1 is also a substrate for PKA in vivo. For that purpose, rats were injected for various times with glucagon after which liver nuclei were prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors to prevent dephosphorylation of NIPP-1. In the lowerpanel of Fig. 7, it is shown that the administration of glucagon resulted in a time-dependent decrease of the binding of DIG-PP-1C to NIPP-1, with a maximal effect after 30-60 min. By 90 min the binding of DIG-PP-1C had almost returned to the control value. Again, all of the observed differences were abolished by preincubation of the blots with a mixture of PP-2AD and PP-2B. Also, Western analysis showed an equal concentration of NIPP-1 at all investigated time points (not shown), providing additional evidence that the observed differences cannot be explained by a different loading of NIPP-1. We did not find any evidence for a regulation of the activity of PP-1NR111 or of the binding of DIG-PP-1C to R111 through phosphorylation by PKA or casein kinase-2. In two previous studies it was concluded that PP-1 is present in hepatic nuclear extracts as free catalytic subunit(7Jakes S. Mellgren R.L. Schlender K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Kuret J. Bell H. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 230: 197-202Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the data of the present work, showing an association of the catalytic subunit with inhibitory polypeptides. One obvious reason for this discrepancy is our use of lower NaCl concentrations (0.3 M) for the solubilization of PP-1N versus 1-2 M in (7Jakes S. Mellgren R.L. Schlender K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and (8Kuret J. Bell H. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1986; 230: 197-202Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which presumably caused dissociation of the catalytic subunit. Moreover, at NaCl concentrations above 0.3 M, histones are extracted(27Goodwin G.H. Sanders C. Johns E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 38: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), which have been shown to interfere with the phosphorylase phosphatase assay(1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). An additional explanation for the generation of free PP-1C in nuclear fractions is the extreme sensitivity of regulatory polypeptides to endogenous proteases (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Perhaps such proteolysis is mediated by the multicatalytic proteasome complex, which was shown to be present in liver nuclei(28Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In agreement with this proposal, we found that the degradation of the regulatory polypeptides of PP-1 is blocked by leupeptin (Figure 1:, Figure 2:), which has also been found to block the trypsin-like activity associated with proteasomes. It cannot be excluded that nuclear proteolysis provides a mechanism for regulating the activity of PP-1N in vivo, as has been shown for other nuclear proteins(29Cressman D.E. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26594-26597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A widely used approach for the initial identification of the protein phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate a particular substrate is based on the screening of subcellular fractions in the presence or absence of specific phosphatase inhibitors/activators(1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Such a strategy has for example recently been employed for the identification of the nuclear phosphatase(s) acting on p34cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1 (30Sola M.M. Langan T. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or PKA-phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein, CREB(31Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Our investigations show that this approach may yield a wrong estimate for the contribution of PP-1N. Indeed, unless a host of protease inhibitors are added and fresh material is used, one obtains free catalytic subunit whose substrate specificity differs from that of holoenzymes (Table 1). It is also important to note that PP-1N itself is controlled by reversible phosphorylation (this study and Refs. 11 and 12). In the absence of functional protein kinases (for lack of MgATP), PP-1N will be (auto)dephosphorylated during tissue fractionation, and studies on such fractions may therefore not be informative for the activity of native PP-1N. Due to the extreme sensitivity of the noncatalytic polypeptides of PP-1 to proteolysis (this study and (1Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)), the PP-1 holoenzymes are very resistant to purification. We have therefore adopted an alternative strategy for the identification of the noncatalytic subunits in crude fractions that is based upon their high affinity binding of DIG-labeled PP-1C (Fig. 3). The same approach has previously been used for the identification of the PP-1C-binding subunit of purified PP-1M(26Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that this approach does not necessarily allow one to identify all PP-1C-binding polypeptides. Thus, we have noted that inhibitor 2 and the active 16-18-kDa fragments of NIPP-1 from bovine thymus do not bind DIG-PP-1C after denaturing electrophoresis. Also, although it seems likely that the heat-stable inhibitor(s) of PP-1C that are generated during incubation of nuclei (Fig. 2) are proteolytic degradation products of NIPP-1 and/or R111, we have been unable to detect the accumulation of small, heat-stable inhibitor(s) with the DIG-PP-1C-labeling technique (not shown). The copurification and coimmunoprecipitation of NIPP-1 and PP-1NR41 (Fig. 3-5), combined with the migration of the holoenzyme during gel filtration as a protein of about 90 kDa (Fig. 5A), strongly indicate that native PP-1NR41 is a heterodimer of PP-1C and NIPP-1. We suggest that PP-1NR41 represents the native hepatic homolog of PP-1Nα, which was previously identified in thymus nuclear extracts(11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Van Eynde A. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The latter migrated as a 50-kDa polypeptide during gel filtration and was also proposed to be a heterodimer of the catalytic subunit and NIPP-1. The smaller mass of the thymus enzyme is likely to be explained by proteolysis of NIPP-1 during nuclear fractionation resulting in the generation of active 16-18-kDa fragments. The copurification and coimmunoprecipitation of R111 and PP-1NR111 (Fig. 3) suggest that R111 is a subunit of PP-1NR111. From gel filtration, we deduced an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa, which agrees with a heterodimeric structure between PP-1C and R111. However, due to the extreme lability of the enzyme (Fig. 4B), it cannot be excluded that the native phosphatase is larger and/or contains additional subunit(s). Western analysis suggested that both PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111 contain the δ-isoform of the catalytic subunit (Fig. 6). Moreover, both species of PP-1N could be immunoprecipitated with PP-1CS-specific antibodies. However, since only about 70% of the activities of PP-1NR41 and PP-1NR111 were precipitated with these antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that a minor fraction of the holoenzymes contains other isoform(s) of PP-1C. We found that the phosphorylation of NIPP-1 by PKA was associated with a lesser binding of PP-1C (Fig. 7). This agrees with similar findings on PP-1Nα from bovine thymus(11Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in contrast with the thymus enzyme and with the partially purified liver enzyme, which both contain a heat-stable proteolytic fragment of NIPP-1, intact hepatic PP-1NR41 was not activated by phosphorylation with PKA and/or casein kinase 2. This suggests that native NIPP-1 is more tightly bound to the catalytic subunit than are the heat-stable fragments of NIPP-1. Perhaps, phosphorylation by additional protein kinases is required for dissociation of the native holoenzyme. It can also be envisaged that dissociation and reassociation of PP-1NR41 are independently controlled processes and that PKA only controls the reassociation of the holoenzyme. We thank Dr. A. A.

In the present study, we show that Sp1 and Egr-1 can specifically bind to these overlapping elements, that this binding appears to be mutually exclusive, and that binding site occupancy is dependent upon the concentration of each factor and its binding affinity for each site. Egr-1 binds to the −165 bp site with relatively high affinity (IC50 = 14 nM) and to the −45 bp site with relatively low affinity (IC50 = 1360 nM), whereas Sp1 binds to both sites with intermediate affinities (IC50 = 210 and 140 nM, respectively). Consistent with the DNA-binding data, Egr-1 stimulates PNMT promoter activity primarily through interaction with the −165 bp site, while Sp1 stimulates PNMT promoter activity by interacting with both the −45 bp and the −165 bp sites. These results show that Sp1 and Egr-1 are capable of differentially activating PNMT gene expression, thereby suggesting that different stimuli may control the activity of the PNMT gene by selectively regulating Sp1 and/or Egr-1.

In an effort to identify the factors that regulate PNMT gene expression, we have recently shown that the immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1 (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B.

Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar), can stimulate transcription of the rat PNMT gene. Stimulation appears to occur through direct binding of Egr-1 protein to PNMT promoter elements located at −165 bp and to a lesser extent, at −45 bp, relative to the transcriptional initiation site at +1 bp (11Ebert S.N.

A perfect (9/9) match to the Egr-1 consensus DNA binding sequence (CGCCCCCGC) (5Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) is located at the −165 bp site, while an 8/9 consensus match (GCGGGGGGG) is located at the −45 bp site. Overlapping the 5′ end of these Egr-1 consensus elements are consensus binding sites for another transcription factor, Sp1 (consensus = (G/T)(G/A)GGC(G/T)(G/A)(G/A)(G/T) (12Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), indicating that Sp1 may also influence PNMT gene expression. Sp1 is a ubiquitous mammalian transcription factor thought to be involved in the regulation of a large number of genes (18Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar; 20Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For housekeeping genes that lack TATA and CAAT boxes, it has been suggested as being the signal initiating transcriptional activation (3Blake M.C. Jambon R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar; 17Joliff K. Li Y. Johnson L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Bosclair et al., 1993). Sp1 binding sites have also been shown to overlap the binding sites for other transcription factors, and it is thought that competition between Sp1 and these factors for binding site occupancy may be an important mechanism for controlling the expression of specific genes (22Lemaigre F.P. Lafontaine D.A. Courtois S.J. Durviaux S.M. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1811-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; 1Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 16949-16957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using gel mobility shift assays, we have previously shown that Sp1, present in nuclear extracts from a PC12-derived cell line (RS1 cells), can bind to DNA sequences representing the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 consensus elements from the rat PNMT promoter (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations designed to disrupt Egr-1 binding to its cognate consensus elements in the PNMT promoter also decreased base-line (uninduced) PNMT promoter activity. We speculated that this decline might be due to a reduction in Sp1 binding. The present study was undertaken to determine the role Sp1 may play in the regulation of PNMT gene expression and to distinguish its action from that of Egr-1. We demonstrate that Sp1 can bind to both overlapping consensus elements (−45 bp and −165 bp) with similar affinities and that this binding appears to stimulate transcriptional activity from the PNMT promoter. Egr-1, which also binds to both consensus elements, has ∼100-fold higher affinity for the distal site (−165 bp), and the integrity of this site is critical for Egr-1 activation of PNMT gene expression. These findings suggest that both Sp1 and Egr-1 can activate PNMT gene expression at these overlapping consensus elements, raising the possibility that selective activation of Sp1 or Egr-1 in response to specific stimuli may be biologically important for the activation and responsiveness of the PNMT gene. Eight duplex 21-mer oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing individually synthesized complimentary DNA fragments as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These duplex oligonucleotides represent wild-type and mutant forms of the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 DNA-binding elements from the rat PNMT promoter. In general, wild-type DNA sequences are designated with the prefix “wt” while mutants have the prefix “mut” followed by an “A” or “B” to indicate which of the overlapping elements from the rat PNMT promoter are represented by each duplex oligomer (A, −159 to −179 bp; B, −39 to −59 bp) (see Fig. 2). Each mutation carries an additional annotation indicating whether the mutation is specific for the Sp1 consensus sequence (designated by the number 1) or the Egr-1 consensus sequence (designated by the number 2). Thus, “wtA” refers to the wild-type overlapping consensus elements for Sp1 and Egr-1 located between −159 and −179 bp in the rat PNMT promoter, while “mutA1” and “mutA2” indicate that this same DNA fragment harbors a mutation that specifically targets the Sp1 and the Egr-1 consensus elements, respectively. The DNA sequences for the various oligonucleotides are as follows (mutant nucleotides are distinguished by lowercase letters): wtA, 5′-CCTCCCCGCCCCCGCGCGTCC-3′; mutA1, 5′-CCTCaaCGCCCCCGCGCGTCC-3′; mutA2, 5′-CCTCCCCGCCCCataGCGTCC-3′; wtB, 5′-GTCTGGGCGGGGGGGAGGGGA-3′; mutB1, 5′-GTCTaaGCGGGGGGGAGGGGA-3′; and mutB2, 5′-GTCTGGGCGGGGaaaAGGGGA-3′. As a positive control for Sp1 binding, a sequence previously shown to be a high affinity Sp1 binding site (Christy and Nathans, 1989), “Sp1” (5′-TAGAGGGGCGGGGCTCTAGAC-3′) was generated. As a negative control, an oligomer containing the PNMT glucocorticoid response element, “GRE” (5′-GCCAGAACAGAGTGTCCTTTC-3′), was also prepared. Finally, for site-directed mutagenesis, the following mutagenic 33-mer oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: mutA1P, 5′-CCACATCTCCCCCCTCaaCGCCCCCGCGCGTCC-3′; mutA2P, 5′-CCCCCTCCCCGCCCCataGCGTCCGTCCGGCGC-3′; mutB1P, 5′-GTGATGGAGGGGTCTaaGCGGGGGGGGAGGGG-3′; and mutB2P, 5′-GGGGTCTGGGCGGGGaaaAGGGGACCCAGTAG-3′. All oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA International, Inc. (Lake Oswego, OR). The wild-type PNMT-luciferase plasmid construct, pRP863LUC, contains the region of the rat PNMT promoter extending from −863 bp to +20 bp fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant PNMT-luciferase constructs were created by incorporating each of the mutagenic primers independently into pRP863LUC using the Transformer™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identity and integrity of the resulting plasmids, pRPmutA1LUC, pRPmutA2LUC, pRPmutB1LUC, and pRPmutB2LUC, were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Sequenase 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The Egr-1 expression vector, pCMVEgr-1, and the corresponding nonfunctional control plasmid, pCMVETTL, have been described elsewhere (14Gupta M.P. Gupta M. Zak R. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12813-12816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were amplified in the XL1-Blue strain of E. coli (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) and purified through two successive CsCl density gradients. Following purification, plasmid integrity and identity was again verified by restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequence analysis. Using [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, Wilmington, DE) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.), a DNA fragment from the rat PNMT promoter was labeled at either the HindIII site (+20 bp) or the NheI site (−391 bp, 32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.104Google Scholar). Fragments labeled at the HindIII site were digested further with NheI, while those labeled at the NheI site were digested with HindIII, and radiolabeled DNA fragments (+20 bp to −391 bp) isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (30Muller M.T. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 858-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 7.5 × 104 dpm of each DNA fragment was incubated with 0-5 footprinting units (fpu) of purified Sp1 (1 fpu, ∼50 ng of Sp1 protein; Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 μl on ice using the binding buffer supplied in the Core Footprinting System™ (Promega). After incubation for 1 h, DNase I footprinting was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The optimal RQ1 DNase I (Promega) concentration (0.1 unit/reaction) was determined empirically in preliminary experiments. DNase I cleavage patterns were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% sequencing gel), and protected sequences were mapped by comparison to Maxam and Gilbert G and G/A chemical sequencing ladders generated from these same DNA probes and run in adjacent lanes on the gels (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.104Google Scholar). The banding patterns were visualized by autoradiography. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 1 ng of radiolabeled probe (∼3 nM, specific activity = 2.5 × 108 dpm/μg) and purified proteins in place of crude nuclear extracts. Typically, 0.5 fpu of purified Sp1 protein (Promega) was used per binding reaction, while 100 ng of the Egr-1 DNA binding domain protein, V5 (13Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. Vikas P. Sukhatme (Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School), was utilized per reaction. For DNA competition experiments, excess concentrations of specific unlabeled duplex competitor 21-mers were included in the binding reactions. Relative binding was quantitated from the intensity of the protein-DNA complexes as determined densitometrically from the autoradiographic images using Image 1.52 software (National Institutes of Health) on a MacIntosh FX computer. The concentration of competitor oligomer that effectively inhibited maximum binding by 50% (IC50) was calculated by plotting the concentration of each competitor versus the intensity of radiolabeled DNA-protein complexes. RS1 cells, a subclone of the PC12 cell line (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% defined iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Inc., Logan, UT), 5% donor equine serum (Hyclone, Inc.), gentamycin sulfate (50 μg/ml; U.S. Biochemical Corp.), and hygromycin B (200 units/ml; Calbiochem) in a 37°C incubator (7% CO2, 93% air) as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays were performed by calcium-phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total protein and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were also determined as described previously (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least twice with six replicates/sample for each experiment. Statistical significance was determined by one way analysis of variance. The rat PNMT promoter contains two overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 consensus binding elements (Fig. 1). Both consensus sequences share six base pairs, with the Sp1 consensus sequences extending an additional three bp in the 5′ direction and the Egr-1 consensus sequences extending three bp in the 3′ direction. The distal overlapping site, located at −165 bp, contains a perfect match to both the Egr-1 (5Cao X. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and Sp1 consensus sequences (Faisst and Meyer, 1992). The proximal site, located at −45 bp, contains an 8/9 match to the Egr-1 consensus DNA binding sequence and a perfect match to the Sp1 consensus sequence. We have previously shown that Egr-1 can bind to these two sites in the rat PNMT promoter, and Sp1 appeared to bind as well (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the DNA sequences involved in Sp1 binding to the rat PNMT promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2, Sp1 binds at two sites, both of which were predicted from the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 consensus elements. The distal or “A” site spans the region between −176 and −162 bp, while the proximal or “B” site includes the nucleotide sequences between −55 and −39 bp. No other protected regions were observed. To determine the relative binding affinity of Sp1 for these sites, competitive gel mobility shift assays were performed. A representative experiment, utilizing a probe corresponding to the wild-type A site (wtA), is shown in Fig. 3. The results demonstrated that Sp1 binding to the wtA probe was effectively competed by either wtA itself or the wild-type B oligomer sequence (wtB) with similar relative affinities (IC50 for wtA = 210 nM; IC50 for wtB = 140 nM). However, the wtA and wtB sequences appeared to represent only moderate affinity Sp1 binding sites, since the high affinity Sp1 competitor sequence (Christy and Nathans, 1989) more effectively competed for Sp1 binding than either the wtA or wtB sequences (IC50 for Sp1 = 12 nM). In contrast, the GRE oligonucleotide, representing the glucocorticoid response element, did not compete for Sp1 binding (IC50 for GRE > 2000 nM). Similar results were obtained when wtB was used as the probe instead of wtA (data not shown). Thus, while Sp1 bound specifically to the A and B sites in the PNMT promoter, it did so with only moderate affinity. Since Sp1 binding in the PNMT promoter overlaps those regions bound by Egr-1, Sp1 and Egr-1 may potentially compete for binding at a given site. To examine this possibility, the wtA and wtB probes were incubated with increasing concentrations of Sp1 in the presence of a constant amount of the purified Egr-1 DNA binding domain protein (V5) (Fig. 4). V5 bound to the probe and formed a complex that migrated between the unbound probe and the Sp1-DNA complex. As the concentration of Sp1 was increased, Sp1-DNA complex formation correspondingly increased while V5-DNA complex formation diminished. Conversely, when the Sp1 concentration was kept constant and the V5 concentration increased, Sp1-DNA complex formation appeared to be displaced in favor of V5-DNA complex formation (Fig. 5). Since no additional or intermediate protein-DNA complexes were observed, Sp1 and V5 binding to either the A or the B site appeared to be mutually exclusive, with occupancy dependent upon the relative concentration of these two factors.Figure 5:V5 displacement of Sp1 binding at the A site. Gel mobility shift assays were performed using the 21 bp wtA probe in the presence of a constant amount of Sp1 protein (0.5 fpu/reaction) and increasing quantities of V5 protein. Lane1, probe alone; lanes2-6, probe and Sp1 protein plus 100, 200, 400, and 1000 ng of V5, respectively. The specific complexes are identified to the left of the autoradiogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, occupancy of these promoter elements by Sp1 or Egr-1 appeared to be dependent upon the relative binding affinities of these two factors for each site. For example, V5 binding to the A site was much stronger than its binding to the B site (compare V5-DNA complex intensities in Fig. 4, lanes5 and 13). Consistent with this observation is the fact that equivalent concentrations of Sp1 could displace V5 binding at the B site much more effectively than they could at the A site (Fig. 4, compare lanes14-16 with lanes6-8). Similarly, Sp1 binding at the A site was readily displaced by V5 (Fig. 5), whereas equivalent concentrations of V5 only partially interfered with Sp1 binding at the B site (data not shown). Hence, binding site occupancy was dependent upon both the relative concentration of Sp1 and Egr-1 and the relative binding affinity of each factor for the two overlapping sites. To discriminate between the actions of Sp1 and Egr-1 in the PNMT promoter, we attempted to selectively interfere with the binding of either factor by incorporating specific mutations into the nonoverlapping region of each binding site (Fig. 6). The mutations were then evaluated for their ability to bind to Sp1 and Egr-1 using competitive gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 6). The mutA1 mutation targets the Sp1 consensus binding element at the A site by changing the second and third cytosine bases to adenosine (Fig. 6, A and B), while the mutA2 mutation converts the 3′ CGC triplet of the Egr-1 binding site into ATA (Fig. 6, A and B). A similar set of mutations was generated for the overlapping consensus elements at the B site. The mutB1 mutation targets Sp1 binding by converting the second and third guanosine residues to adenosine (Fig. 6, C and D), whereas the mutB2 mutation specifically alters the Egr-1 consensus element by replacing the 3′ terminal GGG triplet with AAA (Fig. 6, C and D). IC50 values for these competitors are shown in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab As is apparent from Fig. 6A and Table 1, the mutA1 mutation reduced the binding affinity for Sp1 approximately 5-fold compared with the wtA sequence, yet this mutation had very little influence on Egr-1 binding (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the mutA2 mutation eliminated Egr-1 binding (Fig. 6B). In addition, although its ability to compete for Sp1 binding was also compromised, the reduction in Sp1 binding affinity was relatively small compared with the decrease in Egr-1 binding affinity (2.5-fold compared with 140-fold, respectively; Table 1). Thus, mutA2 preferentially reduced Egr-1 DNA-binding affinity, while mutA1 selectively reduced Sp1 binding affinity. Similarly, the mutB1 mutation effectively reduced Sp1 binding, but its ability to compete for Egr-1 binding was relatively unchanged (Fig. 6, C and D, Table 1). As expected, the mutB2 mutation, designed to reduce Egr-1 binding affinity, substantially reduced Egr-1 binding compared with its wild-type counterpart (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, however, the mutB2 sequence enhanced Sp1 binding 3.5-fold compared with the wild-type B sequence. Thus, the mutations appeared to behave predictably with respect to their ability to interfere with either Sp1 or Egr-1 binding, with the exception of mutB2, which displayed increased affinity for Sp1. To evaluate the effects of these same mutations on PNMT promoter activity, the mutA1, mutA2, mutB1, and mutB2 mutations were incorporated into PNMT-luciferase reporter plasmid constructs, and reporter gene expression was evaluated by transient transfection assays using RS1 cells. Reporter gene constructs with mutations reducing relative Sp1 binding affinity (mutA1, mutA2, and mutB1) produced 30-50% less luciferase activity in comparison with the wild-type control (Fig. 7). In contrast, the reporter gene construct containing the mutation that increased Sp1 DNA-binding affinity, mutB2, also increased luciferase activity approximately 4-fold. Thus, the changes in luciferase expression appeared to reflect the changes in the relative binding affinities for Sp1. Finally, the ability of Egr-1 to stimulate PNMT promoter activity was examined in co-transfection assays using the same complement of PNMT-luciferase plasmids and either a functional or a nonfunctional Egr-1 expression construct. As shown in Fig. 8, Egr-1 significantly increased (p < 0.001) luciferase expression from the wild-type, mutA1, mutB1, and mutB2 PNMT-luciferase plasmids but not from the mutA2 PNMT-luciferase construct. Moreover, the responsiveness of the mutA1 and mutB1 PNMT-luciferase plasmids to Egr-1 was not significantly different from that of the wild-type construct (Fig. 8). As indicated earlier, neither of these mutations substantially changed the relative affinity for Egr-1 binding (Table 1), consistent with their inability to influence Egr-1 activation of luciferase activity. In contrast, the mutB2 mutation reduced Egr-1 binding to the B site (Fig. 6, Table 1), yet Egr-1 still significantly stimulated luciferase activity from the mutB2 PNMT promoter, likely due to the integrity of the A site. These results, therefore, suggest that Egr-1 stimulation of PNMT promoter activity may primarily depend upon Egr-1 binding to PNMT promoter DNA at the A site. The present study extends our previous findings demonstrating that Egr-1 activates the expression of the rat PNMT gene and that Sp1 is a potential transcriptional activator as well. We show that Sp1 binds to both overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 consensus elements (−45 and −165 bp) while Egr-1 binds preferentially to the A site (−165 bp). The integrity of the Egr-1 consensus element at the A site is essential for Egr-1-stimulated PNMT promoter activity, while the B site (−45 bp) does not appear to influence Egr-1-mediated PNMT promoter activation. Mutations that decrease Sp1 binding to its consensus elements in the PNMT promoter reduce basal promoter activity in the RS1 cells, while a mutation that increases Sp1 binding stimulates PNMT promoter activity. Finally, Sp1 displaces Egr-1 binding at the overlapping consensus elements in a concentration-dependent manner. While the evidence suggests that both Egr-1 and Sp1 function as transcriptional activators of the PNMT gene, their specific transcriptional roles remain to be elucidated. Egr-1, a member of the immediate early gene family, is usually present at low levels endogenously but can be rapidly and transiently induced in response to a variety of external stimuli (27Milbrandt J.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Egr-1 is therefore considered to be a transcriptional factor that acts as a modulator of basal gene expression. Consistent with this role, we have recently shown that Egr-1 expression in the rat adrenal medulla is rapidly activated neurally by reserpine treatment, which also causes significant increases in PNMT mRNA (35Wong D.L. Bildstein C.L. Siddall B. Lesage A. Yoo Y.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; 11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have further shown that the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, can induce PNMT promoter activity via an Egr-1-dependent mechanism in RS1 cells (29Morita K. Ebert S.N. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11161-11167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sp1 is a ubiquitous protein, constitutively expressed at very high levels, and it appears to act as a transcription initiator for many housekeeping genes that lack TATA and CAAT boxes (3Blake M.C. Jambon R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar; 17Joliff K. Li Y. Johnson L.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, Sp1 protein has been demonstrated to be regulated developmentally and in response to specific stimuli (16Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar; 31Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that this factor may be critical during differentiation and has the potential for regulated expression as well. If the latter is indeed the case, then under appropriate circumstances, Sp1 might also function as a modulator of basal gene transcription. Based on our studies to date, the PNMT promoter functions as a weak promoter in RS1 cells in comparison with other promoters, particularly the viral promoters (11Ebert S.N. Balt S.L. Hunter J.P.B. Gashler A. Sukhatme V. Wong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20885-20898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It does possess sequences consistent with an ATA (−30 bp) box. Hence, if Sp1 participates in constitutive PNMT expression, we would predict that the observed low levels of basal PNMT promoter activity may be due to the fact that the Sp1 consensus binding sites in the PNMT promoter are not high affinity sites. However, when we compared the Sp1 sites within the PNMT promoter with the nine-nucleotide Sp1 sequence identified by Faisst and Meyer(1992), their perfect match suggested that these sites should be very effective Sp1 sites (Table 2). Yet, gel mobility shift competition assays showed that the Sp1 sites were only of moderate binding affinity. A 10-nucleotide Sp1 consensus sequence has been identified as an alternative to the nine-bp Sp1 consensus element and has been confirmed as a high affinity site (18Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar; 20Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). If we consider the PNMT Sp1 sequences, the 10th nucleotide, located at the 3′ end, is mismatched and reduces Sp1 binding 10-fold in comparison with the perfect match 10-bp sequence, suggesting that this nucleotide is critical in specifying the binding affinity for Sp1. In fact, the 10-bp Sp1 element at the B site in the PNMT promoter is identical to an Sp1 element in the herpes simplex virus type 1 IE3 gene promoter (18Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (878) Google Scholar; 20Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C. Steitz T.A. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which also has intermediate affinity for Sp1 protein. Thus, the wobble in the distal 3′ nucleotide of the PNMT Sp1 consensus elements is consistent with the observed low basal PNMT promoter activity and moderate binding affinity as predicted from the 10-bp Sp1 high affinity consensus sequence.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The relative affinities of the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 binding sites for their respective proteins and the ability of Sp1 to compete with Egr-1 for binding at the overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 sites in a mutually exclusive, concentration-dependent fashion also suggest important biological ramifications. Since Egr-1 can preferentially displace Sp1 binding at the A site, and in so doing, enhance PNMT promoter activity, the A site may normally function as a high affinity Egr-1 site in the presence of sufficient amounts of Egr-1 protein. However, when Egr-1 levels are low, the A site may alternatively function as an Sp1 site, albeit of moderate affinity. In contrast, the B site where Egr-1 binding seems to have little effect on Egr-1-mediated PNMT promoter activity, may be a biologically active Sp1 site under most circumstances. Consistent with this interpretation is a marked reduction in basal PNMT promoter activity when the B site is mutated. A similar reduction is observed with mutation of the A site, but this occurs at low basal Egr-1 levels, a circumstance where the A site may function as an Sp1 site as predicted above. Several other genes have also been identified with overlapping or closely adjacent Sp1/Egr-1 binding motifs (1Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; 24Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Bongiorno C. Taylor P. J. Biol.

In the case of the murine adenosine deaminase gene, Sp1 stimulates, while Egr-1 represses, adenosine deaminase promoter activity (1Ackerman S.L. Minden A.G. Williams G.T. Bobonis C. Yeung C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The inhibitory action of Egr-1 is opposite to its effects on the PNMT promoter reported here. However, both the stimulatory and inhibitory actions of Egr-1 on transcriptional activity are consistent with the functional domains of Egr-1 protein (13Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Egr-1 has been shown to have three activating and one inhibitory domain, although the specific biological roles and activities of these domains remain to be identified. In summary, we have shown that Sp1 and Egr-1 can differentially stimulate PNMT gene expression through interactions with overlapping consensus elements in the PNMT promoter. Sp1 seems to interact with both the A and B sites with moderate binding affinities to induce PNMT promoter activity. In contrast, Egr-1 acts predominantly through the A site, where it appears to effectively exclude the binding of Sp1, thereby increasing PNMT promoter activity. The differences in binding affinities of Sp1 and Egr-1 for their overlapping consensus sequences in the PNMT promoter, their apparent exclusionary binding, and differences in their abilities to activate transcriptional activity from the PNMT promoter suggest that these two factors may play unique roles in the control of PNMT gene expression in response to specific biological stimuli. Further definition of their biological roles will therefore be an important focus for future studies."

Of interest were reports that p21SDI1 also bound proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary protein for DNA polymerase δ, and inhibited DNA replication but not DNA repair in vitro. To better understand the function of this interaction in vivo, we first determined the region of p21SDI1that was needed for PCNA binding. Analysis of deletion mutants of p21SDI1, which covered the majority of the protein, revealed that deletion of either amino acids 142-147 or 149-154 resulted in loss of ability to bind a glutathione S-transferase-PCNA fusion protein. Site-directed mutagenesis in this region led to the identification of the PCNA binding motif RQXXMTXFYXXXR and demonstrated that mutation of either amino acid Met-147 or Phe-150 resulted in almost complete ablation of PCNA binding. Interestingly, when we determined DNA synthesis inhibitory activity of deletion mutants or point mutants that were unable to bind Cdk2 and/or PCNA, we found that loss of binding to PCNA did not affect inhibitory activity, whereas lack of Cdk2 binding greatly reduced the same.

It is becoming increasingly clear that growth control involves the expression of positive and negative regulatory genes. In studies of cellular senescence, we and others had accumulated evidence for the expression of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis in terminally non-dividing senescent cells(1Lumpkin C.D. McClung J.K.

The finding that p21SDI1 could also bind proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and inhibit DNA replication but not DNA repair in vitro suggested that this could be an alternative path for growth inhibition by the gene(9Waga S.

Dimri, M. Nakanishi, J. R. Smith, and J. Campisi, submitted for publication. In order to understand the in vivo functions of p21SDI1, the functional domains corresponding to each mechanism need to be identified and subjected to a mutational analysis. We have recently identified the Cdk2 binding region of p21SDI1and demonstrated that mutants that lack binding to Cdk2 exhibit a significant loss in DNA synthesis inhibitory activity(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study we have demonstrated that amino acids 141-155, with the motif RQXXMTXFYXXXR, are involved in binding to PCNA. Interestingly, loss of binding to PCNA did not affect the DNA synthesis inhibitory activity of the gene. The deletion mutants of p21SDI1 were generated by standard PCR techniques using as a template either p21SDI1HA cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) or pCMVp21SDI1HA, in which a hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence was placed in-frame at the C terminus (13Nakanishi M.

The primers used to obtain the W49G point mutant have been described previously(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The W49G + M147A double point mutant was constructed by PCR using the primer set for the M147A mutant, described above, and the W49G cDNA as a template. All constructs were sequenced to verify that the desired deletions or mutations had been made, that the HA tag was intact, and to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced into the constructs. The human PCNA cDNA was amplified by PCR from total RNA isolated from CSC303 cells, a human neonatal foreskin fibroblast cell line (14Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Somatic Cell Genet. 1982; 8: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using PCR primers CGTGGATCCCACTCCGCCACCATGTTCGAG and GCTGGGATCCTAGAAGCAGTTCTCAAAGAG. BamHI sites were included in the primers so that after BamHI digestion of the PCR product it could be cloned in-frame into the BamHI cloning site of the pGEX-2T GST fusion protein vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The PCNA cDNA was sequenced to ensure the accuracy of the PCR amplification procedure. The various deletion or site-directed mutants of p21SDI1 were translated in reticulocyte lysates (Promega) using pBluescript-based plasmids as transcription templates for T7 RNA polymerase. Labeling of translation products was performed using 40 μCi of [35S]methionine (1100 Ci/mM) (ICN) in a 50-μl reaction. 5 μl of each translation reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the remaining 45 μl of the translation product was used for in vitro binding assays, which contained 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM NaF, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml of aprotinin) and the indicated amount of GST-PCNA fusion protein or GST protein alone. The mixture was gently rocked for 1 h at 4°C and then absorbed by incubation for 1 h with 40 μl of glutathione-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer prior to electrophoresis and autoradiography to detect the 35S-labeled p21SDI1. Cdk2 binding assays were performed as described previously(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cdk2 protein (provided by D. Morgan) for binding assays was purified from a baculovirus expression system(15Rosenblatt J. De Bondt H. Jancarik J. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). MDAH041, immortal human skin fibroblast cells, were derived from a patient with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. These cells do not express an active p53 gene product as a frameshift mutation causes premature termination in the N-terminal region of the molecule(16Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.G. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Details of cell culture conditions have been described previously(14Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Somatic Cell Genet. 1982; 8: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MDAH041 cells in 35-mm dishes were co-transfected with 1 μg of pCMVβ-gal and 1 μg of the plasmid DNAs described above using calcium phosphate precipitation(17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). pCMVβgal was used as a marker to detect transfected cells. Tritiated thymidine (1 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium 24 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were fixed, stained for β-galactosidase activity, and processed for autoradiography to determine the percentage of β-galactosidase positive cells that had synthesized DNA(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The percentage inhibition was determined relative to control cells co-transfected with pCMV vector and pCMVβ-gal. cDNAs encoding the deletion mutants (5 μg) were co-transfected with pCMV-βgal into MDAH041 cells in 100-mm dishes using the calcium phosphate precipitation method described above. After 24 h the cells were harvested in 500 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). In order to normalize the cell lysate for transfection efficiency, 50 μl of the extract was used for assay of β-galactosidase activity to calculate extract loading volumes (based on an equivalent amount of β-galactosidase activity) for SDS-PAGE (16.5% acrylamide). Following transfer to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), proteins were detected by incubation with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (1:1500; BabCo) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) using Kodak XAR-5 film. To confirm that specific binding occurred between p21SDI1 and PCNA, we produced wild-type p21SDI1 protein in an in vitro translation system. The protein was 35S-labeled and incubated with different amounts of a GST-PCNA fusion protein or GST alone, and the resulting complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The wild-type protein bound the GST-PCNA fusion protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), and the specificity of the p21SDI1-PCNA interaction was confirmed by incubation with GST protein alone. In vitro translated p21SDI1 failed to bind GST protein even when as much as 2 μg of the protein was added (Fig. 1A). Since we had previously found that in vitro translated p21SDI1 bound to purified Cdk2 in vitro(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether interaction with Cdk2 affected binding to PCNA. The addition of various amounts of purified Cdk2 to the binding reaction was found to have no apparent effect on binding to PCNA (Fig. 1B), suggesting that p21SDI1 could bind to PCNA independently and also that Cdk and PCNA binding occurred simultaneously. This hypothesis is supported by the results of Xiong et al.(4Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3139) Google Scholar), who found that increasing amounts of p21SDI1 resulted in an increased amount of PCNA in the cyclin-Cdk-p21SDI1-PCNA complex. In order to identify the region required for association with PCNA, various deletion mutants of p21SDI1 were constructed by PCR and 35S-labeled mutant proteins produced by an in vitro translation system. Translation products were tested for the ability to bind to GST-PCNA in vitro and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2, A and B). Only two deletions, of amino acids 142-147 and 149-154, had no ability to bind to PCNA, and deletion of amino acids 156-161 resulted in weak binding (Fig. 2A, 15% of wild type). The other deletions had almost the same binding activity as wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). Since the N-terminal truncated mutants, deleted in amino acids 1-16, 1-21, 1-31, and 1-41, and a large internal deletion of amino acids 17-52 also bound to PCNA as well as wild type (Fig. 2B), the results indicated that the PCNA binding region was between amino acids 141 and 155. Deletions in amino acids 49-53, 53-58, 58-61, 61-66, and 66-71, which fail to bind to Cdk2 (Fig. 4C, (13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and data not shown), showed almost the same activity as wild type (Fig. 2A) suggesting that the PCNA binding domain did not overlap with the Cdk2 binding region. Interestingly, the PCNA region overlaps with a putative nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal region (3Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp.

However, we have found that this region is not necessary for translocation to the nucleus or DNA synthesis inhibitory activity(13Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, this region is highly conserved between the human and mouse sequence (Fig. 3B)(12Huppi K. Siwarski D. Dosik J.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3017-3020PubMed Google Scholar) p21. Amino acids written in boldface represent those critical for binding to PCNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the native structure of the p21SDI1protein could potentially be adversely affected by the creation of small deletions, we then performed site-directed mutagenesis in the region of amino acids 141-155. The amount of product translated in vitro was determined for each point mutant, as well as the ability of the in vitro translated proteins to bind PCNA (Fig. 3A). Since the amount of protein produced by each mutant varied, the binding capacity was normalized to the amount of product synthesized. The results demonstrate that mutation M147A and F150A resulted in an almost complete loss of binding to PCNA. Significant loss (>50%) of binding was also caused by mutation of residues 144, 148, 151, and 155. Interestingly, mutation of residues 141, 142, 146, 152, and 153 resulted in almost no loss of binding ability. Thus, the sequence of the PCNA binding region of p21SDI1 encompasses amino acids 141-155, with the specific amino acids involved in binding denoting the motif RQXXMTXFYXXXR (Fig. 3B). This sequence has no significant sequence similarity to other proteins in the data base, and in particular to cyclin D1 and GADD 45, both of which have been shown to bind to PCNA(18Matsuoka S. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11030-11036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smith M.L Chen I-T. Zhan Q. Bae I. Chen C-Y. Gilmer T.M. Kastan M.B. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This suggests that the binding site, and perhaps the mechanism of binding to p21SDI1, is different from that of other proteins, and the fact that both amino acids 147 (methionine) and 150 (phenylalanine) are hydrophobic suggests that the interaction is hydrophobic. This is supported by the fact that in the mouse cDNA methionine 147 has been substituted by another hydrophobic amino acid, leucine (Fig. 3B). We constructed mutants that contained deletions in the Cdk2 binding region (Δ49-53 and Δ17-52), the PCNA binding region (Δ142-147), and both binding regions (Δ49-53 and Δ142-147) in a mammalian expression vector driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV vector). These were transfected into MDAH041 cells, which do not express detectable levels of endogenous p21SDI1(16Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.G. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar), and therefore provided a sensitive assay for small changes in DNA synthesis inhibitory activity that might be expected when these mutants were overexpressed. Transfection of the full-length coding region resulted in a ˜95% decrease in the percentage of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine (Fig. 4A). Deletion mutant Δ17-52, which failed to bind to Cdk2 (Fig. 4C) but bound to PCNA (Fig. 2B), did not exhibit any significant DNA synthesis inhibitory activity (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, deletion of amino acids 49-53 resulted in decreased Cdk2 binding (Fig. 4C) and decreased DNA synthesis inhibitory activity to about 50% of wild type (Fig. 4A), but binding of PCNA was similar to that of wild-type p21SDI1 (Fig. 2A). Deletion of amino acids 142-147, which contained amino acids important for PCNA binding (Fig. 2A), did not result in any significant loss of DNA synthesis inhibitory activity (Fig. 4A) or Cdk2 binding (Fig. 4C). In order to determine whether inhibition of DNA replication required binding to PCNA, we constructed a double deletion mutant deficient in amino acids 49-53, required for Cdk2 binding (Fig. 4C), and amino acids 142-147, required for PCNA binding (Fig. 2A). Following transfection into MDAH041 cells, this double deletion mutant had almost the same DNA synthesis inhibitory activity as that of deletion 49-53 alone (Fig. 4A), suggesting that a mechanism other than that involving PCNA binding was responsible for the inhibitory activity. One possible explanation for this result is that the presence of the deletions, although relatively small, might result in a gross alteration in protein folding that prevented p21SDI1 from exhibiting its full inhibitory capacity. In order to rule out this possibility, we analyzed point mutants in amino acids that had previously been determined to be important for Cdk2 and PCNA binding. Transfection of the W49G mutant, which has reduced Cdk2 binding (data not shown), resulted in very low DNA synthesis inhibitory activity (Fig. 4D), whereas transfection of the M147A mutant, which does not bind PCNA (Fig. 3A), resulted in inhibition of DNA synthesis equivalent to that observed for wild-type p21SDI1 (Fig. 4D). A double mutant, containing both the W49G and M147A mutations, had very low inhibitory activity, similar to that observed for the W49G mutant (Fig. 4D). These results support the hypothesis that p21SDI1-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis is strongly dependent upon Cdk2 binding and does not appear to require PCNA binding. Thus, inhibition of DNA replication by binding to PCNA is probably not the primary mode of DNA synthesis inhibition by p21SDI1 during the normal cell cycle but rather may be required only in special instances such as DNA damage or progression to tumorigenicity. The potential multifunctional aspects of this gene will only become clearer from future studies. We thank Susan F. Venable for excellent technical assistance and Drs. M. Tainsky for use of the MDAH041 cells and D. Morgan for purified Cdk2."

Mutational analysis of aromatic residues in this domain revealed that phenylalanine 346 is required for internalization. Receptor down-regulation in transiently transfected COS-7 cells was also dependent upon the phenylalanine 346 residue of the GHR, since no GH-induced down-regulation was observed in cells expressing the F346A GHR mutant. In contrast, the ability to stimulate transcription of the serine protease inhibitor 2.1 promoter by the GHR was not affected by the phenylalanine 346 to alanine mutation.

Furthermore, certain isoprostanes have been found to exert biological activity through endogenous receptors on cell surfaces. Using mass spectrometry and ancillary techniques, the free radical oxidation of 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine was studied in the search for products of arachidonic acid isomeric to the leukotrienes that are derived from 5-lipoxygenase-catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid. Several conjugated triene metabolites were chromatographically separated from known 5-lipoxygenase products and structures characterized as 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid esterified to the glycerophosphocholine backbone. We have termed these products as B4-isoleukotrienes. Following saponification some, but not all, B4-isoleukotrienes were found to exert biological activity in elevating intracellular calcium in Indo-1-loaded human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This activity could be blocked by a leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist. An EC50 of approximately 30 nM was determined for one unique B4-isoleukotriene with a relative retention index of 2.54. We have shown that free radical processes can lead to the formation of biologically active isoleukotrienes in glycerophosphocholine liposomes, and we propose that B4-isoleukotrienes may also be formed in membrane glycerophospholipids as a result of lipid peroxidation during tissue injury.

Oxygen free radicals are generated in vivo by a variety of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions(1Pryor W.A. Annu. Rev.

While the exact biochemical mechanisms relating free radical generation to the pathology are unclear, most points of view consider profound alterations in tissue biochemistry as a result of lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, or irreversible alteration of proteins(7Floyd R.A.

Although lipid peroxidation leads to a large number of products, some of which are stable species derived from polyunsaturated fatty acyl substituents of phospholipids in membrane bilayers, the measurement of low molecular weight products such as pentane, malonyldialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal have been the most widely measured oxidation products for studies of lipid peroxidation(12Shimizu T. Kondo K. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Basu A. Marnett L. Carcinogenesis. 1984; 4: 331Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It is likely, however, that these low molecular weight products result from extensive rearrangement of the initial oxidized phospholipid species and, as such, may not reflect initial oxidation events taking place at the lipid bilayer membrane level. Recently compounds that are isomeric to prostaglandins (isoprostanes) were discovered to be generated by free radical-mediated processes and whose formation was not catalyzed by the enzyme prostaglandin H synthase(14Morrow J.D.

F2-isoprostanes (isomeric of prostaglandin F2α) were readily identified esterified to phospholipids in the liver of rats that had been treated with carbon tetrachloride in a model of free radical hepatotoxicity(16Kayganich-Harrison K.A. Rose D.M. Murphy R.C. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1229-1235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One such free radical product, 8-epi prostaglandin F2α was also found to have significant biological activity as the free acid. This isoprostane was found to cause a potent constriction of the renal artery of the rat and reduced glomerular filtration rate in the rat kidney(17Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It was also found to have activity in other organs including the lung, where it constricted the pulmonary artery, but was a more potent constrictor of the bronchial airway in the isolated perfused lung(18Kang K.H. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Newman J.H. Banerjee M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 74: 460-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, these biological activities could be prevented or even reversed by a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist(17Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts II, L.J. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), suggesting that this F2-isoprostane was exerting its pharmacological effect through the endogenous receptor for thromboxane. These findings have led to the suggestion that isoprostanes may serve as lipid mediators of free radical-induced damage at the tissue level(15Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R.

Since the nonenzymatic, free radical-induced formation of F2-isoprostanes in vivo result from a free radical attack on arachidonoyl-containing phospholipids in vivo, it became of interest to investigate whether or not other complex molecules esterified to phospholipids could be formed by free radical reactions, in particular complex molecules structurally related to the leukotrienes. Leukotrienes are normally thought to be derived only from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. To clarify whether or not such compounds could be formed, we investigated the free radical oxidation 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine liposomes and report that hydroxyl radical generated by a modified Fenton reaction (19Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar) led to the formation of numerous products including several isomers of leukotriene B4 (isoleukotrienes) that exhibited biological activity via the leukotriene B4 receptor.

H2O2 (30%, w/v), and 6 mM CuCl2 were added to the solution resulting in final concentrations of 600 mM and 100 μM, respectively. The solution was capped and heated to 37°C on a gently shaking water bath for 3 h. For some experiments reactions were allowed to continue at 5°C overnight before extraction. Progress of oxidation was monitored by UV absorbance at 235 nm for conjugated dienes and 270 nm for conjugated trienes in a 0.1% aliquot. glycerophosphocholine phosphate-buffered saline high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry leukotriene B4 gas chromatography relative retention index. The reaction mixture was loaded onto 2 g of reverse phase 40-μm silica particles packed in a low pressure glass column. The column was preconditioned with 30 ml of methanol followed by 30 ml of PBS under slight pressure. Salts and remaining H2O2 were eluted with 30 ml of water. Oxidized GPCho was eluted with 15 ml of methanol into a 50-ml pear-shaped flask. The remaining 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPCho was eluted with an additional 10 ml of methanol. Hydroperoxides or endoperoxides formed during the oxidation reaction were reduced with stannous chloride to prevent further rearrangement and degradation of these products. Stannous chloride (100 mM) was added to the methanol fraction containing the oxidized GPCho to a final concentration of 1 mM. The flask was placed on a rotary evaporator and the solvent removed to near dryness. The remaining liquid in the flask was rinsed into a test tube (∼1 ml) and injected directly onto the reverse-phase HPLC system. A Beckman (Berkeley, CA) ODS 5-μm 4.6 mm × 25-cm column with a Waters (Marlborough, MA) ODS Guard-pak precolumn was used to separate the oxidized GPCho. The solvent system (system A) consisted of 85% methanol, 1 mM ammonium acetate at 1.5 ml/min for 25 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% methanol, 1 mM ammonium acetate over a 50-min period. Either a photodiode array detector (Hewlett-Packard 1090A) or a linear 206 scanning UV detector (Linear Instruments, Reno, NV) were used to continuously record UV spectra, scanning from 205 nm to 320 nm with a 1-nm step size. A fraction collector was used to collect effluent at 1-min intervals. For those experiments in which radiolabeled 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl GPCho was used, 10% of the oxidized GPCho products were separated on HPLC with a Flo-One Beta (Radiomatic, Riviera Beach, FL) radiochromatography detector connected to the effluent stream after the UV detector. Reverse phase HPLC fractions containing the conjugated triene chromophore were analyzed using electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. Flow injection was used to introduce 2 μl of the HPLC fractions at a flow rate of 10 μl/min with 85% methanol, 1 mM ammonium acetate as the mobile phase. The Sciex API III+ (Perkin-Elmer Sciex, Toronto, Canada) was operated in negative ion mode with an orifice voltage of −105 V in order to collisionally decompose the GPCho acetate adducts to [M − 15]− ions. Product ion spectra were obtained using a collision energy of 30 eV and collision gas thickness (argon) of 220 × 1012 molecules/cm2. Negative ion ESI mass spectra of the oxidized fatty acids obtained from hydrolysis of the oxidized GPCho were obtained using an orifice voltage of −60 V. For all ESI analyses, the curtain gas flow was 1.2 liter/min, the nebulizer pressure was 40 p.s.i., the turbospray flow was 7 liters/min, and the turbospray temperature was 400°C. Fractions from the first HPLC separation (system A) identified as containing components with a conjugated triene chromophore were saponified by addition of 0.5 ml of 1 N sodium hydroxide at room temperature for 1 h. The fractions were then acidified with 50 μl of 88% formic acid, and the methanol evaporated under vacuum. The fractions were reconstituted in 1 ml of 30% methanol, 70% water (0.05% acetic acid), pH 5.7, for injection into the HPLC system. Spectra of peaks eluting from the Beckman ODS 5-μm 4.6 mm × 25-cm column with a Waters ODS Guard-pak precolumn were continuously collected using a photodiode array detector. The HPLC was operated with a three-step gradient (system B) starting at 40% B and ramping to 55% B in 6 min, then to 61% B in 15 min, and to 100% B in 5 min, where B = methanol:acetonitrile (35:65) and A = 0.05% acetic acid, adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions were automatically collected at 0.5 min/tube. The elution of each component relative to prostaglandin B2 and LTB4 external standards was calculated by the following equation for relative retention index (RRI). RRIretention time unknown - retention time PGB2retention time LTB4 - retention time PGB2+1(Eq. 1) HPLC analysis of the external standards was run immediately after the analysis of oxidized eicosanoids. Changes in neutrophil intracellular calcium levels were determined by measuring the fluorescence of Indo-1 as described previously (20Powell W.S. Gravel S. MacLeod R.J. Mills E. Hashefi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9280-9286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor changes. The intracellular calcium levels were calculated as described (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a dissociation constant of 250 nM for Indo-1/Ca2+ complex. In some cases, the cells were preincubated with 10 μM LTB4 receptor antagonist, LY223982, prior to the addition of agonists. The remainder of the HPLC system B fractions containing the hydrolyzed fatty acids were analyzed both by electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry and by electron impact ionization mass spectrometry using a Finnigan SSQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan Corp., San Jose, CA) interfaced with a capillary gas chromatograph column. For electron capture GC/MS, a portion of the fractions were derivatized as pentafluorobenzyl esters and trimethylsilyl ethers as described previously(22Wheelan P. Zirrolli J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Prior to electron ionization GC/MS, samples were hydrogenated by bubbling hydrogen gas through a methanol solution of the sample for 30 min using rhodium adsorbed on alumina as the catalyst (∼1 mg). The samples were then derivatized as pentafluorobenzyl esters trimethylsilyl ethers. Reverse phase HPLC separation of the oxidized 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPCho revealed the presence of a large number of products. The major component in the mixture remained unreacted 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerophosphocholine, as indicated by the absorbance profile at 205 nm and elution at 78 min (Fig. 1A). The elution of conjugated trienes was indicated by absorbance at 270 nm (Fig. 1B), and many components absorbing at this wavelength were detected having significantly less lipophilicity than the starting material. The UV spectra of several components eluting between 44 and 54 min were suggestive of the characteristic vibronic UV absorption of conjugated trienes, as illustrated by the component eluting at 53 min in this HPLC separation (Fig. 1B, inset). The UV absorption profile at 235 nm (data not shown) revealed elution of several conjugated diene oxidized products in this same general area of the chromatogram. Aliquots of each fraction collected during the HPLC separation were analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, which yields abundant [M − 15]− ions for the lipid glycerophosphocholine molecular species(23Kerwin J.L. Tuininga A.R. Ericsson L.H. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1102-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, fraction 53 yielded abundant [M − 15]− ions at m/z 798.6 and 814.7. These [M − 15]− ions were then selected for subsequent tandem mass spectrometry. Collision-induced decomposition of the ion at m/z 798.6 from fraction 53 yielded two carboxylate anions at m/z 255 (characteristic for hexadecanoate) and m/z 335 (corresponding to the addition of two oxygen atoms to the arachidonate carboxylate anion) consistent with the carboxylate anion for a dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (Fig. 1C). The ion at m/z 480 corresponded to the loss of the sn-2 substituent as a neutral ketene, confirming that the dioxygenated arachidonoyl moiety was esterified at sn-2. The ions at m/z 317 and 195 likely resulted from secondary fragmentation of m/z 335. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of HPLC fractions between 44 and 54 min revealed elution of several dioxygenated eicosatetraenoic acids esterified at the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. The oxidized GPChos in the fractions between 44 and 54 min (Fig. 1A) were individually saponified and the liberated oxidized fatty acids were purified by the second reverse phase HPLC, system B. Components were observed in several fractions that had UV spectra with maximum absorption at 270 nm and vibronic bands 10 nm on either side at 260 and 280 nm, characteristic of a conjugated triene (Table 1). Each HPLC fraction (system B) was tested for its ability to elicit an increase in intracellular calcium from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes loaded with the fluorescent dye Indo-1 to screen for components with biological activity. HPLC separation of the free acids liberated from phospholipid fraction 53 (system A) is shown in Fig. 2A with the elution of a single component at 15.3 min (RRI = 2.54) absorbing at 270 nm (Fig. 2A, inset). The 0.5-ml fraction collected between 15 and 15.5 min was also found to have the highest level of activity in elevating intracellular calcium in the human neutrophil (Fig. 2B). Other closely eluting molecules maximizing in adjacent fractions were also present in this sample; however, these components did not have the characteristic UV chromophore of a conjugated triene (data not shown) but may have biological activity.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Negative ion ESI/MS of the HPLC fractions (system B) containing conjugated triene free acids consistently revealed [M − H]− ions at m/z 335, consistent with the carboxylate anion expected for dioxygenated arachidonic acid. Collision-induced decomposition of m/z 335 from these fractions yielded numerous product ions that were similar but often not identical to those observed following collision-induced decomposition of LTB4 (data not shown). Collision-induced decomposition of m/z 335 from the component eluting at 15.3 min (Fig. 2A) yielded the MS/MS spectrum shown in Fig. 3A with characteristic ions at m/z 59, 129, 195, and 317, all of which are also observed upon collision-induced decomposition of m/z 335 from LTB4, 6-trans-LTB4, and 6-trans-12-epi-LTB4. This collision-induced decomposition mass spectrum differed significantly from that of other dihydroxy eicosanoids such as 8,15-, 5,6-, or 5,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid isomers (data not shown). This mass spectral data was consistent with a 20-carbon fatty acid containing four double bonds and two hydroxyl substituents. The covalent backbone of the molecule was established following catalytic reduction of this metabolite using hydrogen and Rh/Al2O3 followed by derivatization to the pentafluorobenzyl ester trimethylsilyl ether. The electron ionization mass spectrum (Fig. 3B) clearly revealed the presence of a saturated 20-carbon fatty acid derivative with two hydroxyl groups as trimethylsilyl ethers. The α-cleavage ions m/z 555 and 215 supported assignment of a 12-hydroxy substituent, and m/z 369 and 401 supported assignment of a 5-hydroxy substituent(24Murphy R.C. Handbook of Lipid Research: Mass Spectrometry of Lipids. Plenum Press, New York1993: 106-108Google Scholar). A conjugated triene could only exist between the hydroxyl substituents at carbon atoms 5 and 12, placing the triene at carbons 6, 8, and 10. While the position of an isolated double bond at carbon 14 was not unambiguously assigned, this was the original position of the ω-6 double bond in arachidonic acid and this portion of the molecule was likely not altered by the oxidation process. The structure of this free radical product was thus established as 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, a B4-isoleukotriene. The oxidized phospholipid from which this dihydroxyeicosanoid was obtained was therefore 1-hexadecanoyl-2-[5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoyl]glycerophosphocholine (see Fig. SI).Figure SI:Scheme I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Table 1, several conjugated triene eicosanoids were products of the free radical oxidation of 1-hexadecanoyl-2-arachidonoyl-GPCho. Several of these eicosanoids were found to stimulate an increase in intracellular free calcium ion in the human neutrophil. The absolute quantity used in the neutrophil assay differed for each sample since an equal proportion (16%) of each HPLC fraction was tested for biological activity and the absolute yield of each eicosanoid free radical product varied. In order to compare activities in the absence of complete dose-response curves, the biological activity in Table 1 is expressed as the natural logarithm of the increase in intracellular calcium concentration (nM) per nanomolar concentration of eicosanoid tested. Some compounds displayed no activity in this assay. For example, the component with the HPLC relative retention index at 1.66 elicited no increase in intracellular free calcium ion when tested at a concentration of 28.2 nM (54 pmol). In contrast, the component that eluted with a relative retention index of 1.77 caused an increase of 626 nM [Ca2+]i when tested with 38 pmol. The response of Indo-1-labeled neutrophils to LTB4 (7 pmol) and the isolated isoleukotriene with an RRI = 1.86 (68 pmol) is shown in Fig. 4. Both compounds elicited a large increase in free intracellular calcium within the human neutrophil, although LTB4 was more than 10-fold more potent in this response. In contrast, the dual lipoxygenase product (5S,12S)-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in much larger quantity (90 pmol) elicited only a 43 nM increase in intracellular free calcium ion (data not shown). Further investigation of the pharmacologic effect of leukotrienes on the human neutrophil revealed that elevation of intracellular calcium ion could be blocked by administration of 10 μM LTB4 receptor antagonist LY223982(27Jackson W.T. Boyd R.J. Froelich L.L. Mallett B.E. Gapinski D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, both responses from the component with relative retention index = 1.86 and LTB4 were completely attenuated by the LTB4 receptor antagonist LY223982. The LTB4 receptor antagonist also blocked the biological response elicited by eicosanoids with relative retention index of 2.54 and 1.77 (data not shown). There was sufficient quantity of the isoleukotriene eluting with a relative retention index of 2.54 (Fig. 2A) for a dose-response study (Fig. 5). An EC50 of 30 nM was calculated for this eicosanoid product. This is approximately 100-fold less than that observed for LTB4 itself, which has an EC50 of 0.3-1 nM(25Kobayashi Y. Shimazaki T. Kawajiri K. Shimizu T. Seyama Y. Sato F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Seya A. Terano Y. Tamura S. Yoshida S. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Free radical oxidation of arachidonic acid esterified to glycerophospholipids is known to result in a host of oxidized intermediates. The recent discovery of the isoprostanes as free radical oxidation products of arachidonic acid and arachidonate-containing glycerophospholipids has emphasized that complex rearrangements of intermediate peroxy radical or hydroperoxides, formed as initial oxidation products, can take place. Described here is a new family of free radical-generated eicosanoids derived from arachidonoyl phospholipids. Several dihydroxy eicosanoids were observed, including several that contain a conjugated triene structural feature similar to that observed in the enzymatic products of 5-lipoxygenase. Detailed structural studies of an abundant, biologically active component (RRI = 2.54) revealed this eicosanoid to be a 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. Therefore, we have termed this conjugated triene dihydroxy eicosanoids as a “B4-isoleukotriene” as a free radical product of lipid peroxidation that resembles enzymatically produced LTB4. Several free radical mechanisms are possible by which such dihydroxy-conjugated trienes could be formed from arachidonic acid esterified to phospholipids. It is most likely that two separate radical abstraction events removing the bisallylic hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms 7 and 10 occurred and the addition of molecular oxygen resulted at carbon atoms 5 and 12 of the arachidonic acid backbone. One interesting possibility is an intermediate formation of a leukotriene A4-like structure as a non-free radical intermediate present in the phospholipid. Hydrolysis of such a conjugated triene epoxide with water would yield isoleukotrienes as 5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids. Several B4-isoleukotrienes were found to be potent agonists stimulating the elevation of intracellular free calcium ion in the human neutrophil. Furthermore, this action could be blocked by the LTB4 receptor antagonist LY223982(27Jackson W.T. Boyd R.J. Froelich L.L. Mallett B.E. Gapinski D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 1009-1014PubMed Google Scholar). While the potency of the B4-isoleukotriene that was studied in greatest detail (RRI = 2.54) was found to be somewhat less than that for LTB4 itself, it is similar to that found for other chemotactic substances such as the peptide fMLP(28White J.R.

This B4-isoleukotriene and others described here, if formed in vivo, would have sufficient potency to play an important role in activating or priming neutrophils for a respiratory burst or priming neutrophils for leukotriene production by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Such oxidized products of arachidonate formed in membrane glycerophospholipids as a result of lipid peroxidation could be released as free acids (31McLean L.R. Hagaman K.A. Davison W.S. Lipids. 1993; 28: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and activate nearby cells. As such, these isoleukotrienes would serve as mediators of tissue response to lipid peroxidative events. A number of LTB4 isomers have been synthesized and studied as competitive substrates for the LTB4 receptor(32Leblanc Y. Fitzsimmons B.J. Charleson S. Alexander P. Evans J.F. Rokach J.

A wide variation in activity was observed for such isomers, suggesting certain structural features of LTB4 are important for binding and biological activity, which include a cis configuration of the double bond at carbon-6 and stereochemistry of the 12-hydroxyl substituent. The geometry of the double bonds in the conjugated triene moiety is also quite important for receptor recognition and it is noteworthy that the trans, cis, trans configuration of the double bonds at carbons 6, 8, and 10 confers tighter binding than those isomers having the all trans configuration in the conjugated triene moiety(39Lee T.H. Mencia-Huerta J.-M. Shih C. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, many of the synthetic isomers possess profound activity in many systems. The exact stereochemistry of the biologically active B4-isoleukotrienes is currently under investigation. B4-Isoleukotrienes are a family of free radical-generated eicosanoids derived from arachidonoyl glycerophospholipids. These free radical products of lipid peroxidation resemble enzymatically produced LTB4 in both structure and biological activity. As such they could serve as lipid mediators of cellular free radical damage in tissues exerting an effect by way of the LTB4 receptor."

These LCF-induced events demonstrate an absolute requirement for the cell surface expression of CD4. Because many CD4-mediated T lymphocyte activation events have been demonstrated to require the association of the src-related tyrosine kinase p56lck with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4, we examined the role of p56lck in LCF-induced lymphocyte migration in a murine T cell hybridoma line expressing transfected human CD4. LCF induces the catalytic activity of CD4 associated p56lck at chemoattractant concentrations of cytokine. Hybridoma cells that express CD4 with cytoplasmic point mutations which uncouple the CD4-lck association lack both lck enzymatic activity and chemotactic responses to LCF. The enzymatic activity of lck however does not appear to be required for CD4-mediated migratory signal. First, the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A blocked LCF-induced p56lck activation but had no effect on the LCF-induced motile response. Second, T cell hybridomas expressing a chimeric receptor combining the extracellular domain of human CD4 and murine p56lck which lacked the kinase domain had a normal LCF-induced motile response.

Accumulation of T cells in tissue at sites of antigen deposition requires the mobilization, adhesion, transendothelial migration, activation, and proliferation of lymphocytes(1Roitt I. Essential Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publisher, Oxford1991Google Scholar). Locally produced chemotactic cytokines contribute the major driving force to directed lymphocyte migration during this process via their interaction with cell surface receptors(2Berman J.S. Beer D.J.

Cambier J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2905-2917PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the src-tyrosine kinase family which is tightly associated with CD4(11Veillette A. Brookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B.

In the present investigations we examine LCF-induced p56lckactivity in a murine T cell hybridoma line which has been transfected with human CD4. Our experiments demonstrate that LCF induces CD4-associated p56lck kinase activity in these cell lines. In order to establish a relationship between the LCF-induced enzymatic activity of the kinase and lymphocyte motility, hybridomas expressing CD4 cytoplasmic domain mutants were also studied. The mutations result in the disruption of the physical coupling of CD4 with p56lck(13Sleckman B.P. Shin J. Igras V.E. Collins T.L. Stominger J.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7566-7570Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Neither the CD4-associated kinase activity nor the migration induced by LCF occurs in cells expressing CD4 mutations incapable of binding p56lck. The relationship between p56lckcatalytic activity and lymphocyte migration was examined in cells treated with the tyrosine-kinase specific inhibitor, herbimycin A. At concentrations that completely abolished the enzymatic activity, the LCF-induced motile response was unaffected. Finally, the removal of the kinase domain from CD4-lck chimeras expressed in this hybridoma line resulted in migratory responses comparable to full-length kinase controls. These data suggest that the physical association of p56lck with CD4, and not the enzymatic activity of the kinase, is the essential component for the LCF-mediated lymphocyte motile response. All CD4-expressing murine T cell hybridomas were the generous gift of Dr. Steven J. Burakoff (Dana Farber Cancer Institute Boston, MA)(14Sleckman B. Peterson A. Jones W.K. Foran J.A. Greenstein J.L.

Briefly, The murine T cell line, By155.16 was infected with the MNC retroviral vector which contains a neomycin resistance gene, a cytomegalovirus promoter, and the gene for human CD4. The MNC-CD4 transfectants were selected (G418) and assessed for CD4 surface expression. All cell lines examined had comparable expression of CD4. In addition to wild type CD4, By155.16 was transfected with CD4 containing cysteine to serine point mutations at positions 420, 422, and 430 (MNC-CS420, CS422, CS430)(13Sleckman B.P. Shin J.

Chimeric molecules containing the extracellular domain of CD4 directly ligated to p56lck were also expressed in murine cells. All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing 200 units/ml of penicillin and 200 mcg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant LCF was produced as described previously(8Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Anti-human CD4 antibody Leu 3A was purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA), Anti-murine CD3ε antibody 2C11 was the generous gift of Dr. Anne Rothstein of the Boston University School of Medicine. Rabbit anti-mouse antibodies used as a cross-linking reagent for Leu 3A was purchased from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA). The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A was the generous gift of Dr. Y. Uehara (National Institute of Health Tokyo, Japan). The p56lck antibody used in Western blot analysis was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell migration was performed as described previously(4Berman J.S. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Theodore A.C. Beer D.J. Cell Immunol. 1985; 95: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar). Migration was assessed by a modification of a Boyden chamber technique, by using a microchemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). T lymphocytes (10 × 106/ml) were loaded in the upper well of the chamber, with 30 μl of various concentrations of antibody as chemoattractant placed in the lower well. The two wells were separated by a nitrocellulose filter paper with a pore size of 8 μm. Migration chambers were incubated for 3 h, after which the filters were fixed in ethanol, stained, and migration was assessed by counting of the number of cells that migrated beyond 50 μm, by light microscopy. Cells treated with herbimycin A for both chemotaxis in vitro kinase analysis were incubated with 3 μg/ml (Me2SO) for 18 h, at 37°C in 5% CO2 and were assayed for viability by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were >90% viable. All migration was expressed as percentage values of cell migration in control buffer and statistics calculated by the Student's t test. Data are the mean value ± the standard deviation of three or more experiments. 5 × 106 murine T cells/sample were removed from culture and suspended in ice-cold serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Agonist was added to each sample on ice. The samples were then placed in a 37°C heat block for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of ice cold wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6) and the cells were pelleted. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6) containing protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4°C. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g and the supernatants transferred to fresh Eppendorff tubes. Precipitating antibody and Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added with the samples incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed and 50 μl of ice-cold kinase buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2) was added to each sample. The kinase reaction was started with the addition of 10 μCi/sample of [γ-32P]ATP and an exogenous substrate, acid-denatured enolase. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 4 × SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, subjected autoradiography, and quantitated by densitometry. Under these conditions the incorporation of 32P label was linear for the duration of agonist exposure. Treated immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). The filters were blocked in a solution of 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 125 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM KCl, pH 7.4), washed, and incubated in p56lck antiserum (1:500) in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h. Washed filters were then incubated in goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase. Following a 1-min exposure to Lumi-GLO™ substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) filters were subjected to chemiluminescense autoradiography. Murine T cell hybridomas expressing human CD4 were examined for their ability to induce the catalytic activity of p56lck in response to chemotactically active (10−9M) concentrations of LCF. In addition to the wild type CD4 hybridomas, cells expressing CD4 with selected cysteine to serine mutations were also examined. Alterations in cysteines 420 and 422 have previously been shown to disrupt the lck-binding site on CD4 (15Collins T.L. Uniyal S. Shin J. Stominger J.L. Mittler R.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2159-2162PubMed Google Scholar), while the mutation of cysteine 430, which lies outside of this domain, has no effect on the association of p56lck with CD4 (15Collins T.L. Uniyal S. Shin J. Stominger J.L. Mittler R.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2159-2162PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lines were selected for equal expression of CD4 and exposed to LCF. CD4 immunoprecipitates from treated cells were then assayed for kinase activity by the addition of radioactive [32P]ATP and the exogenous phosphorylation substrate, enolase. Immunoprecipitates from untreated wild type (data not shown) and CS430 murine hybridoma cells, the cysteine to serine control transfectant, (Fig. 1A, lane 2) demonstrated a background level of kinase and enolase phosphorylation, consistent with previous reports(16Bramson H.N Casnellie J.E.

Center, manuscript submitted. a dramatic increase in the autophosphorylation of lck protein was seen following treatment of cells with cross-linked CD4 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 3). A lower, yet detectable, increase in enolase phosphorylation was also observed following antibody stimulation (Fig. 1B). LCF-induced autophosphorylation of lck was also observed although less pronounced (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Enolase phosphorylation following exposure of cells to LCF, however, was substantially increased (Fig. 1B). It is at present unclear what mechanism might regulate the differential incorporation of 32P in respective substrates with these two agonists. The association of p56lck protein with CD4 was, however, not affected by these treatments as comparable levels of lck protein were immunoprecipitated for each condition (Fig. 1C). LCF-induced kinase activity was observable at 30 s, reached a maximum at 2 min, and began to diminish at 5 min (data not shown). The mutants CS420 and CS422, as anticipated, demonstrated no receptor associated kinase activity in either control or LCF-treated cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2:In vitro kinase assay of LCF-induced mutant CD4-associated p56 kinase activity. 5 × 106 CS420 murine T cells were treated as in Fig. 1. Lane 1, precipitation with Protein A alone. CD4 immunoprecipitation from T cell hydridomas were either untreated (lane 2), treated with cross-linked Leu 3A (lane 3), or treated with LCF (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated these murine T cell hybridomas for their ability to migrate in response to LCF. Cells which express either wild type CD4 (open square) or CS430 CD4 (closed diamond) exhibited dose dependent migration following exposure of cells to micromolar-picomolar LCF concentrations (Fig. 3). The hybridoma cells, which express either CS420 (open diamond) or CS422 (closed square) CD4, failed to respond to any dose of LCF (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the binding of the tyrosine kinase was essential to CD4-mediated LCF-induced T cell migration. In order to confirm the CD4 specificity of the migration inactive clones, the cells were examined for their ability to migrate in response anti-CD3 antibody. We have previously shown (8Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that the parental and mock transfected hybridoma lines migrate in response to CD3 antibody. Fig. 4 shows that all four of the murine hybridoma lines expressing different forms, but equal amounts, of CD4 migrated in a similar dose-dependent manner following exposure to anti-CD3 antibody. These experiments demonstrate that the impaired motility observed in the CS420 and CS422 clones in response to LCF was restricted to alterations in CD4 and suggests that the CD4 signaling pathway induced during lymphocyte migration is independent of the signal transduction pathway utilized for anti-CD3-induced motility.Figure 4:Anti-T cell receptor antibody-induced T cell migration.

Along these lines we have recently demonstrated that divalent, uncross-linked anti-CD4 antibodies, incapable of inducing lck kinase activity do induce motile responses dependent on physical association of CD4 with p56lck.2 LCF induction of the kinase enzymatic activity, however, led us to determine whether LCF-induced lymphocyte migration requires the enzymatic activity of p56lck activity. In these experiments CS430 hybridoma cells were exposed to the kinase inhibitor herbimycin A. Herbimycin A has a bimodal effect on tyrosine kinases, first directly decreasing the activity of the kinase(22Uehara Y. Fukazawa H. Murakami Y. Mizuno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 23June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sugimoto Y. Mizuno S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 780-785PubMed Google Scholar). At 18 h, a time when there is complete inhibition of enzymatic activity (Fig. 5) but minimal protein degradation(23June C.H. Fletcher M.C. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Siegel J.N. Phillips A.F. Samelson L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To further understand the role of lck enzymatic activity in CD4-mediated migration, we used two T cell hybridoma cell lines expressing two different CD4-lck chimeras.Figure 6:Effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A on LCF-induced T cell migration.

Cells were selected for stable and equivalent surface expression of these constructs and examined for their LCF-induced migratory response. Fig. 8 shows that hybridoma cells expressing full-length CD4-lck responded to LCF in a dose-dependent manner similar to that of the CD4 wild type control. Cells expressing CD4-lck which lacks the catalytic domain of the kinase demonstrated comparable motility. Thus T cells in which the kinase activity was eliminated either by herbimycin A treatment or construction of kinase deficient chimeric molecules have normal motile responses to LCF. These data indicate that while LCF induces CD4-associated lck kinase activity and that induced migration requires lck association with CD4, LCF-induced cell migration is independent of the catalytic activity of the kinase. CD4 is required as an essential component of the cell surface signaling complex engaged during LCF-induced motility. The evidence for this relationship rests with CD4 transfection experiments in which we have previously shown that the LCF-induced rises in [Ca2+]in and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) are CD4 dependent(7Cruikshank W.W. Greenstein J.L. Theodore A.C. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2928-2934PubMed Google Scholar), as is the motile response (8, Fig. 3). Further, LCF-induced chemotactic responses in monocytes (5Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar) and eosinophils (6Rand T. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Weller P.F. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) are also directly dependent upon the expression of cell surface CD4, and Fab fragments of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody inhibit all LCF-induced functions on these cells(5Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rand T. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Weller P.F. J. Exp.

The data presented in this paper extend these observations to show that LCF induces CD4-associated p56lck kinase activity and therefore provides further evidence for a direct signaling role of CD4 in LCF-induced functions. In conjunction with previous work,2 the physical association between the src family tyrosine kinase p56lck and CD4 is essential for LCF-induced lymphocyte migration. The activation of T cell motile response mediated via CD4 is independent of the catalytic activity of the receptor-coupled kinase. These findings are consistent with recent reports which have identified a kinase independent role for p56lck during T cell activation (10Goldman F. Jensen W.A. Johnson G.L. Heasley L. Cambier J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2905-2917PubMed Google Scholar, 20Collins T.L. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11885-11889Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Xu H. Littman D.R.

Biol. 1993; 3: 434-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) SH2 and SH3 of p56lck appear most likely to provide a recruitment site for these molecules to the CD4-lck complex. The ability of cells, expressing CD4-lck chimeras which lack the catalytic domain, to migrate in response to LCF strongly suggests the involvement of SH2/SH3 binding intermediates in the signal transduction mechanism of lymphocyte motility. For the motile response, one of the principle events is the induction of cellular shape changes through the reorganization of the cytoskeletal structures(2Berman J.S. Beer D.J. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Bernardo J. Center D.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 142: 238-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Along these lines, the second messengers generated by phospholipase Cγ, IP3, and [Ca2+]In are both released in response to LCF (7Cruikshank W.W. Greenstein J.L. Theodore A.C. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2928-2934PubMed Google Scholar) and have been reported to regulate actin-binding proteins (31Adams R.J. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1989; 340: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and changes in the cytoskeleton(32Shelanski M.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 568: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), as well as the activation of their down stream effector enzyme protein kinase C(33Thorp K.M. Southern C. Matthews N. Immunology. 1994; 81: 546-550PubMed Google Scholar). The link to the cytoskeleton could be the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase which associates with src kinases, by binding to SH3 domains(34Liu X. Marengere L.E.M. Kock C.A. Pawson T. Mol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternatively, there might be a direct link between actin-binding proteins, which have been demonstrated to contain SH3 domains(37Drubin D.G. Mulholland J. Zhu Z. Botstein D. Nature. 1990; 343: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the CD4-coupled p56lck complex. Our data also suggest an explanation for the observations that the CD4 ligands HIV-1 gp120 and anti-CD4 antibodies appear to require cross-linking to induce some, but not all CD4 related activation pathways and cellular functions. The lymphocyte chemoattractant factor is a 14-kDa protein which exists as a bioactive tetramer of 56 kDa in supernatants of conconavalin A or histamine-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells(39Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Beer D.J. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1854-1859PubMed Google Scholar, 40Berman J.S. McFadden R.G. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Beer D.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1495-1504PubMed Google Scholar). We subsequently demonstrated that the cDNA for LCF codes for a 14kDa protein, which autopolymerizes to 56 kDa. There is an absolute requirement for a polymerized form of LCF for the biologic activities(8Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, cross-linking of other ligands such as anti-receptor (CD4) antibody2 or multimeric gp120(9Kornfeld H. Cruikshank W.W. Pyle S.W. Berman J.S. Center D.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), might mimic the natural state of LCF. However, the relationship of CD4 ligands to CD4 must be more complex than a simple cross-linking phenomena as noted for a number of other receptors(41Metzger H. J.

In addition, further cross-linking of divalent anti-CD4 antibody does not further augment the motile response. Intact antibody also down-modulates subsequent activation via CD3, but unlike LCF it does not induce IL-2R nor major histocompatability complex Class II molecules(5Cruikshank W.W. Berman J.S. Theodore A.C. Bernardo J. Center D.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3817-3823PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, intact antibody does not induce any of the traditional intracellular signal transduction pathways including phosphatidyl inositol turnover, rises in [Ca2+]in, nor p56lck enzymatic activity(19Ledbetter J.A.

A. 1987; 84: 1384-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 2 The inability of uncross-linked anti-CD4 antibodies to induce p56lck kinase activity2 but their ability to induce motile responses highlights the dissociation between a proposed “adaptor” function for lck which appears to be essential for communication with motility-dependent cytoskeletal structures and functions associated with lck kinase activity. More extensive aggregation of surface CD4 by LCF, cross-linked anti-CD4 antibodies, and gp120 appear to have the ability to induce cell activation and the intracellular signal transduction systems noted above. We propose, therefore, that the src homology domains of lck, independent of the activation of the kinase, act to recruit intracellular molecules which initiate changes in cytoskeletal structure essential for LCF-induced T lymphocyte migration. Therefore, the induction of p56lck kinase activity by LCF and cross-linked antibodies suggests a role for the catalytic activity in LCF-induced cell activation events other than motility."

For this, we constructed and tested the biological activity in yeast and mammalian cells of a series of chimeric mdr3 cDNAs in which discrete domains of the N-terminal NBD (NBD1) were replaced by the homologous segments of the C-terminal NBD (NBD2). Although most NBD1 segments could be replaced without loss of P-glycoprotein function, exchange of small segments near the Walker B motif caused a dramatic reduction in Adriamycin, actinomycin D, and colchicine resistance in LR73 cells, as well as in FK506 resistance and STE6 complementation in yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis identified amino acid positions 522-525 (ERGA → DKGT) and 578 (Thr → Cys) as essential for proper function of NBD1 in the context of the N-terminal half P-glycoprotein. In addition, the observed phenotype of the mutants (altered drug resistance profile) suggests that these residues may participate directly or indirectly in substrate interactions and are possibly implicated in signal transduction from NBDs to transmembrane domains, the primary sites of drug binding in P-glycoprotein.

Multidrug resistance in cultured cells in vitro and malignant tumors in vivo is caused by the expression of a membrane phosphoglycoprotein, called P-glycoprotein (reviewed in Refs. 1Chan H.S.L.

This structural unit has been evolutionarly conserved in a large number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins known as the ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) superfamily of transporters(10Hyde S.C.

In prokaryotes, this group of transporters can import or export, at the expense of ATP, a large variety of structurally unrelated substrates such as sugars, amino acids, peptides, ions, and others(11Higgins F.C.

The exact mechanism by which P-glycoprotein mediates reduction of drug accumulation remains controversial. Although several studies in homologous and heterologous systems have demonstrated active drug transport by P-glycoprotein(2Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar, 7Ruetz S. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12277-12284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ruetz S. Raymond M. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schindler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3497-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)). In addition, the recent demonstration that P-glycoprotein encoded by mdr2 functions as a lipid translocase (22Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) suggests a potential flippase mechanism for mdr1- and mdr3-mediated drug transport(22Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 23Higgins C.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 393-395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the absence of three-dimensional structural information, the identification of structure/function relationships in P-glycoprotein has relied on the scrutiny of P-glycoprotein primary sequence and on biochemical and genetic analysis. Although the exact topology and number of TM segments of P-glycoprotein remain to be fully defined, considerable evidence indicates that the hydrophobic domains are intimately associated with drug binding. First, energy transfer experiments using membrane probes and MDR drugs indicate that drug molecules interact with P-glycoprotein within the cell membrane(24Raviv Y. Pollard H.B. Bruggeman E.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3975-3980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar conclusions were drawn from a study in which extrusion of fluorescent cellular indicators from drug-resistant cells was monitored (25Homolya L. Holló Z. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21493-21496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from experiments where forskolin-binding to P-glycoprotein was analyzed(26Morris D.I. Speicher L.A. Ruoho A.E. Tew K.D. Seamon K.B. Bichemistry. 1991; 30: 8371-8379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, epitope mapping studies of proteolytic P-glycoprotein fragments labeled with photoactivatable drug analogs identify two small 4-5-kDa peptides as drug-binding sites located within or immediately C-terminal to TM6 and TM12(27Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, analysis of P-glycoprotein mutants showing alterations in drug resistance profiles reveals that mutations near or within TM domains affect substrate specificity(28Choi K. Chen C.-J.

The key role of TM domains in substrate recognition and binding has also been established for CFTR and TAP1/TAP2, where mutations near or within these segments affect ion selectivity of the channel (35Anderson M.P. Gregory R.J. Thompson S. Souza D.W. Paul S. Mulligan R.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Science. 1991; 253: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) and peptide specificity of the pump (36Powis S.J. Deverson E.V. Coadwell W.J. Ciruela A. Huskisson N.S. Smith H. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1992; 357: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), respectively. The two nucleotide-binding sites in P-glycoprotein are defined by the presence of consensus Walker A (GX4GKS/T) and Walker B (R/KX6-8LHyd4D, where Hyd is a hydrophobic residue), motifs previously described for many nucleotide-binding proteins and ATPases(37Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The lysine present in the Walker A motif is believed to interact with the phosphate group of ATP while the B motif might form a hydrophobic pocket housing the adenine moiety of the nucleotide(38Fry D.C. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In addition, ABC transporters present a third consensus sequence, the linker peptide, preceding the B motif and defined by the sequence LSGGX3RHydXHydA(39Ames G.F.-L. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shyamala V. Adv. Enzymol. Areas Mol. Biol. 1992; 65: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar). Computer modelling studies based on the structure of adenylate kinase predict the presence of additional structural features specific to ABC transporters(10Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 40Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F.-L.

Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), are located between the A motif and linker peptide and have been proposed to play a role in energy-coupling from the NBDs to the TM regions to effect transport(10Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 40Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Ames G.F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport requires the presence of cellular ATP(41Dano K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 323: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 42Skovsgaard T. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 4722-4727PubMed Google Scholar), and a drug-stimulatable ATPase activity for P-glycoprotein has been characterized by several groups ((43Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and references within). Analysis of half-protein expression demonstrates that each of the two NBDs of P-glycoprotein can hydrolyze ATP(44Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of chimeras constructed between mdr1 and mdr2 indicate that corresponding NBDs from the two P-glycoprotein isoforms are exchangeable (Mdr2 NDB1 → Mdr1 NBD1; Mdr2 NBD2 → Mdr1 NBD2) and are an important component of the common mechanism of action of the different P-glycoprotein isoforms(45Buschman E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations introduced in the A motif of either of the two P-glycoprotein NBDs completely abrogate drug resistance, stressing the key role of these sequences in P-glycoprotein function(46Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Also supporting the functional importance of each NBD is the observation that either naturally occurring, or experimentally introduced mutations in either NBD of other ABC transporters such as CFTR (47Tsui L.-C. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and Ste6 (48Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) abolish or greatly reduce their activity. One of the unresolved issues concerning the function of P-glycoprotein is whether both NBDs are equivalent, and thus interchangeable, or whether each functions only within the context of a specific membrane environment provided by TM domains. Identifying the intramolecular interactions between the NBDs and their environment may help elucidate the mechanism of energy transfer from the NBDs to the TM regions to mediate transport. A considerable body of data suggests that cooperative interactions involving both sets of TM domains and NBDs of P-glycoprotein (and of other ABC transporters) are required for transport. For example, photolabeling studies with drug analogs identify drug-binding sites in both TM regions of P-glycoprotein(27Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11417-11425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in either of the two Walker A motifs cause a complete loss rather than a reduction of function(46Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Likewise, independent expression of either half of Ste6 fails to create a functional transporter, while expression of both polypeptides in the same cell restores a-factor transport and mating(48Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Many experiments further indicate that functional differences exist between the two NBDs of ABC transporters. In Ste6, mutations in NBD1 have a more deleterious effect on function than mutations at the homologous residue of NBD2(48Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In CFTR, expression of the N-, but not of the C-terminal half of the protein, results in the appearance of a fully regulated channel(49Sheppard D.N. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1091-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, competitive inhibition of CFTR function by ADP seems to occur mostly through interactions with NBD2 but not NBD1(50Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and equivalent mutations in NBD1 and NBD2 of CFTR produce opposite effects on sensitivity of the channel to activation by forskolin(51Smit L.S. Wilkinson D.J. Mansoura M.K. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9963-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The goals of the present study were first to determine whether both NBDs of P-glycoprotein are functionally equivalent, and then to identify the protein segments and amino acids that are not interchangeable and are therefore likely to be involved in specific interactions with the environment in which each NBD is fully active. Plasmid pDR16 (52Devault A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1652-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) in which the full-length mdr3 cDNA is inserted into the SmaI site of the pGEM7Zf vector (Promega, Canada) was used as template in this study. To facilitate the construction of mutations in NBD1 or chimeric molecules in which parts of NBD1 were replaced with the corresponding segment from NBD2, two unique restriction sites flanking NBD1 were inserted by site-directed mutagenesis. For this, a 2.2-kilobase EcoRI mdr3 fragment (5′-half: polylinker to position 2249) was subcloned into phage vector M13 mp18, and silent mutations creating NruI (position 1346) and SalI sites (position 1908) were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Table 2), using a commercially available kit (Amersham, Canada). The integrity of the BalI to EcoRI mdr3 fragment (positions 798-2249) containing the novel NruI/SalI restriction cassette was verified by sequencing prior to recloning into pDR16. The modified mdr3 cDNA was excised from pDR16 by digesting with SphI and ClaI, and its extremities were repaired with T4 DNA polymerase. It was then inserted into the mammalian expression vector pEMC2b (generous gift of Dr. R. Kaufman, Yale University, New Haven, CT) (pEMC-mdr3), and into the yeast expression vector pVT101-U (pVT; (53Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)) from which the NruI site had been destroyed (pVT-mdr3).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The general strategy for the construction of chimeric mdr3 cDNAs relied on the use of hybrid oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification (54Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar) to fuse non-contiguous DNA segments (Fragments 1, 2, 3; Table 1) in two rounds of PCR. In all chimeric constructs, a NBD1 fragment was replaced by the homologous segment of NBD2, while NBD2 was left intact. The strategy and protocol were as follows. First, individual NBD2 fragments to be duplicated (Fragments 2) were amplified by PCR using an mdr3 3′ half-template and complementary oligonucleotide primers described in Table 1(e.g. chimera A, primers 3326s and 3409a). Similarly, fragments from NBD1 flanking individual Fragments 2 on either side were PCR amplified from an mdr3 5′ half-template. The upstream 5′ fragments (Fragments 1) were generated using one primer located 5′ of the NruI site (chimera A, primer 1295s) and an antisense chimeric primer in which 12 nucleotides at the 5′ end were complementary to the corresponding Fragment 2 and 12 nucleotides at the 3′ end complementary to the adjacent NBD1 sequence (chimera A, primer 1402a). Likewise, the downstream 3′ fragments (Fragments 3) were generated using one antisense primer located downstream of the SalI site (chimera A, primer 2027a), and a sense chimeric primer in which 12 nucleotides at the 5′ end were complementary to individual Fragments 2 and the 12 at the 5′ end complementary to the adjacent NBD1 sequence (chimera A, primer 1481s). To construct individual mdr3 cDNAs with chimeric NBD1 segments, the NBD2-derived Fragment 2 was mixed separately with either adjacent Fragments 1 or 3 in a buffer consisting of 7 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, and 7 mM MgCl2. The DNA fragments were heat denatured (95°C, 5 min), and complementary ends were allowed to re-anneal (37°C for 15 min) before being filled-in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and dNTPs (50 μM). Double-stranded hybrid molecules were recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the 1-2 and 2-3 chimeric molecules were PCR amplified using the proximal primer from Fragment 1 plus the 1-2 hybrid primer (chimera A, primers 1295s and 3409a) or the 2-3 hybrid primer plus the distal primer from Fragment 3 (chimera A, primers 3326s and 2027a), respectively. Finally, the 1-2-3 chimeric molecule was created by a similar strategy using gel purified 1-2 and 2-3 hybrid fragments mixed and amplified with the proximal primer from Fragment 1 and the distal primer from Fragment 3 (chimera A, primers 1295s and 2027a). Fragment 1-2-3 was then digested with NruI and SalI, gel-purified, and cloned into the corresponding cassette of pVT-mdr3 or pEMC-mdr3. All amplification reactions were carried out for 20 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 45°C, and 1 min at 72°C) in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris (pH 8), bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), 50 mM NaCl, 200 μM of each dNTP, MgCl2 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mM, 0.5 units of Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Canada), and 0.5 ng of template. The integrity of the nucleotide sequence of PCR-amplified fragments and of restriction enzyme sites used to produce all constructs were ascertained.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab mdr3 mutants bearing discrete substitutions in NBD1 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a commercially available system (Amersham, Canada). For this, single-stranded DNA template from the 2.2-kilobase EcoRI mdr3 fragment served as a template for creating mutants R488D/E489N/D490S/RV, N544Q, K546H, N544Q/K546H, E522D/R523K/A525T, A563K, T578C, and A567E. Mutant T578C was used as a DNA template for creating mutants E522D/R523K/A525T/T578C. All oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are listed in Table 2. All cell populations were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) (complete medium). Wild-type (WT), chimeric, and mutant mdr3 cDNAs cloned in pEMC2b were introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells LR73 by co-transfection with marker plasmid pSV2neo(55Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously(46Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Co-transfectants were selected for 10 days in medium containing Geneticin® (G418; Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, Canada) at a final concentration of 500 μg/ml, harvested as mass populations, and stable mdr3 transfectants were further selected in complete medium containing vinblastine (VBL, 25 ng/ml) (Sigma). VBL resistant (VBLR) cells were harvested as mass populations, expanded, and frozen as several aliquots which were thawed out before each experiment. Drug cytotoxicity assays were carried out using a method based on cell protein staining by sulforhodamine B, as described previously(56Tang-Wai D.F. Brossi A. Arnold L.D. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6470-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In these experiments, a G418R mass population of cells co-transfected with an mdr3 cDNA cloned in pEMC2b in the antisense orientation were used as a negative control. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells from each mass population were plated in duplicate in 96-well titer plates containing increasing concentrations of either VBL, colchicine (COL) (Sigma), Adriamycin (Royal-Victoria Hospital, Montréal, Canada), or actinomycin D (ACT) (Royal-Victoria Hospital, Montréal, Canada). After a 3-day incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed in 17% trichloroacetic acid, and stained with a solution of 0.4% sulforhodamine B in 1% acetic acid. Excess stain was removed by five washes in 1% acetic acid and plates were air-dried overnight. The stain was dissolved in 200 μl of Tris (10 mM, pH 9) and quantitated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad, model 450) set at 490 nm. The relative plating efficiency represents the ratio of the absorbance measured at a given drug concentration divided by the absorbance of the same population of cells plated in the absence of drug. The D50 is defined as the drug concentration required to reduce the relative plating efficiency of each cell population by 50%. The biological activity of pVT-mdr3 constructs was also tested by their capacity to restore mating in a ste6Δ sterile yeast strain, and to confer cellular resistance to the fungicidal compound FK506. Both assays were done in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JPY201 (MATaste6Δura3) which has been described previously(57McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1989; 340: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Strain DC17 (MATαhis1) was used as the tester strain in the mating assays. Strains JPY201 and DC17 were kindly provided by Dr. M. Raymond (Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal, Montréal, Canada). JPY201 cells were transformed with the various pVT-mdr3 constructs by the lithium-acetate method(58Ito H. Fokuda K. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pools of ura+ colonies were harvested, expanded in culture, and kept frozen until used in each experiment. YPD-rich medium, minimal medium, and synthetic medium lacking uracil (S.D.-ura) were prepared as described(59Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1982Google Scholar). The mating efficiency of pVT-mdr3 yeast transformants was quantified by filter assay(60Sprague G.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), according to a procedure we have described previously(61Raymond M. Ruetz S. Thomas D.Y. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mating efficiency was expressed as the ratio of diploid colonies grown on minimal plates to the number of haploid JPY201 transformants introduced in the mating reaction, and is also expressed as the percentage of the mating efficiency of WT mdr3 transformants. Cellular resistance of yeast transformants expressing either WT or mutant mdr3 cDNAs was estimated by a growth inhibition assay using the antifungal peptide macrolite FK506, previously shown to be a P-glycoprotein substrate in yeast(61Raymond M. Ruetz S. Thomas D.Y. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of FK506 (10 mg/ml) were prepared in methanol and kept at −80°C until use. The growth inhibition assay was carried out essentially as described(61Raymond M. Ruetz S. Thomas D.Y. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 277-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh overnight cultures of pVT-mdr3 transformants grown in S.D.-ura were diluted to optical density 0.005 (600 nm) in YPD medium, and added (50 μl) to an equal volume of YPD medium containing 100 μg/ml FK506 (final concentration of 50 μg/ml) in a 96-well microwell titer plate. The plates were wrapped with Parafilm® to prevent evaporation and incubated at 30°C with constant agitation (250 rpm). Growth was monitored by optical density measurement using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad, model 450) set at 490 nm. The growth rate of the various mdr3 transformants was calculated in the exponential growth phase over a 4.5-h period. Growth inhibition by FK506 was measured"
https://openalex.org/W1999200457,"The biosynthesis of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin by Streptomyces coelicolor involves the oxidative dimerization and hydroxylation of a precursor, most likely dihydrokalafungin, as the final steps in its formation. Mutations in the actVB gene block these last steps, and the mutants secrete kalafungin as a shunt product. To investigate the role of the actVB gene in these transformations, we have overexpressed the gene in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant protein. ActVB was shown to catalyze the reduction of FMN by NADH to give NAD and FMNH2, which, unusually, is released into solution. The protein contains no chromogenic cofactors and exhibits no requirements for added metal ions. The reaction obeys simple kinetics and proceeds through the formation of a ternary complex; Km values for FMN and NADH are 1.5 and 7.3 μM, respectively, and kcat is about 5 s−1. FAD and riboflavin are also substrates for the enzyme, although they have much higher Km values. The subunit structure of the enzyme was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation, which showed the protein to exist in rapid equilibrium between monomer and dimer forms.

The possible role of this oxidoreductase in the oxidative chemistry of actinorhodin biosynthesis is discussed. Polyketides comprise a large and diverse family of natural products, which are built up by the head-to-tail condensation of short carboxylic acid units, usually acetate or propionate residues(1O'Hagan D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Horwood, Chichester, UK1991Google Scholar). They are produced by plants, animals, marine organisms, fungi, and, most prolifically, by actinomycete bacteria. Their biosynthesis may be divided into two stages: first, the carbon skeleton is assembled by the requisite polyketide synthase; second, a variety of “tailoring” reactions modify the polyketide structure by, for example, hydroxylation, glycosylation, or methylation. Much interest has focused on the assembly of the polyketide backbone, which is analogous to the biosynthesis of fatty acids(1O'Hagan D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Horwood, Chichester, UK1991Google Scholar). The cloning and sequencing of the polyketide synthase genes for several polyketides has confirmed the analogy with fatty acid biosynthesis and has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the principles of polyketide synthase programming(2Hopwood D.A. Sherman D.H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 37-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Katz L. Donadio S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 875-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 4McDaniel R.

Science. 1994; 263: 378-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, the enzymes that catalyze the tailoring reactions are generally less well understood, even though these later elaborations of the polyketide structure are usually crucial to the compound's biological activity. The biosynthesis of actinorhodin involves, as a late step, an unusual dimerization in which two benzoquinone units are symmetrically joined by a phenolic oxidative coupling (7Gorst-Allman C.P. Rudd B.A.M. Chang C.-J. Floss H.G. J. Org. Chem. 1981; 46: 455-456Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Structural features arising from phenolic couplings are found in a very wide range of natural products, including the oligopeptide antibiotic vancomycin and opiate alkaloids(8Mann J. Secondary Metabolism. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1987Google Scholar), but the enzymic chemistry responsible for them remains largely unexplored. The cloning and sequencing of the relevant part of the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster (9Fernández-Morano M.A. Martnez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presented an opportunity to study an example of this novel enzyme activity using molecular biology. One class of actinorhodin pathway mutants, actVB, is believed to lack the ability to perform the oxidative coupling step and secrete kalafungin as a shunt product (Fig. 1)(10Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.-J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Kalafungin can be converted to actinorhodin(10Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.-J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which suggests that either dihydrokalafungin or 8-hydroxy-dihydrokalafungin is likely to be the substrate for dimerization. The two available actVB mutations have been mapped to a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 177 amino acid residues (Mr 18,400) (9Fernández-Morano M.A. Martnez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the expression of the actVB gene in Escherichia coli and the purification and characterization of the recombinant protein, the first enzyme from the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway to be characterized biochemically. Initially, we had thought that ActVB might catalyze the dimerization of either kalafungin or dihydrokalafungin directly; however, sequence similarity to a component of pristinamycin IIB hydroxylase1 1V. Blanc and D. Thibaut, personal communication. encoded by snaC (11Blanc V. Blanche J. Crouzet N. Jacques P. Lacroix D. Thibaut D. Zagoreg M. Patent WO 94/08014, France. 1994; Google Scholar) and successful complementation of an actVB mutant by snaC2 2V. Blanc, manuscript in preparation. suggested that the protein might function as a flavin:NADH oxidoreductase. The ActVB protein does indeed catalyze reduction of FMN by NADH and is therefore probably an essential auxillary enzyme supplying reduced FMN to another enzyme directly involved in oxidative chemistry. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were from Promega. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was from Melford Laboratories (Ipswich, United Kingdom). Q-Sepharose fast flow anion exchange medium and Sephacryl S-300-HR gel filtration medium were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Matrex gel Blue A (Cibacron Blue 3GA) was from Amicon. NADH, FMN, FAD, and riboflavin were from Boehringer Mannheim. pT7-7(12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), 3 3S.

Kalafungin, nanaomycin, dihydrokalafungin, and actinorhodin were the kind gift of Prof. S. Omura (Kitasato Institute, Tokyo). The actVB gene had been subcloned as a 3-kb BglII fragment (encompassing restriction sites 19-21 as defined in (9Fernández-Morano M.A. Martnez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in pBR329 to give pIJ2347.4 4F. Malpartida, personal communication. pIJ2347 was digested with SmaI and SalI and a 1.1-kilobase fragment encompassing all of the actVB gene, except the first 39 nucleotides isolated and ligated into SmaI- and SalI-digested and dephosphorylated pT7-7. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli TG1 recO 1504::Tn5 by standard methods(15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and recombinant colonies were selected by plating on 2TY agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Recombinant plasmids were analyzed by restriction mapping; the pT7-7 derivative containing the actVB gene minus the first 39 nucleotides was called pACTVB-NT. To reconstruct the 5′-end of the actVB gene, two oligonucleotides, TATGGCTGCTGACCAGGGTATGCTGCGTGACGCTATGGCT and GAGCCATAGCGTCACGCAGCATACCCTGGTCAGCAGCCA, corresponding to sense and antisense strands, respectively, were synthesized. These oligonucleotides both optimized codon usage for highly expressed E. coli genes (16Grosjean H. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and allowed cloning into the NdeI site of the pT7-7 vector. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated, annealed together, and ligated into pACTVB-NT previously digested with NdeI, EcoRI, and SmaI (EcoRI digestion served to prevent the polylinker fragment religating into pACTVB-NT). Transformants were selected by plating on 2TY agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. To confirm that the actVB gene had been correctly reconstructed, plasmids were isolated from the recombinant bacteria, and the nucleotide sequence of the first 100 base pairs of the 5′-region was determined. The plasmid containing the actVB gene under the control of the T7 promoter was designated pACTVB. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pACTVB(15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 10-ml sample of an overnight culture of a transformant was used to inoculate each of six 1-liter flasks containing 500 ml of 2TY media supplemented with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.9, 10% glycerol, 0.4% glucose, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 37°C until an A600nm of 3.5 was reached. These cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended into six 2-liter flasks containing 1 liter of the same medium but without glucose. Expression of ActVB was induced by adding 238 mg/liter isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and the cells were grown for a further 2.5-3 h (A600nm∼4.0). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and stored at −20°C. All steps were performed on ice or at 4°C. In a typical purification, 26-g cells (damp weight) were thawed on ice and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol). Cells were ruptured by passing them twice through a French pressure cell operating at 15,000 p.s.i. internal pressure, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 15 min). Nucleic acids were precipitated by the dropwise addition of 20% streptomycin sulfate solution to a final concentration of 4% and were removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 15 min). The supernatant was then brought to 20% saturation by the slow addition of 107 g/liter solid ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitated by this step were removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 15 min), and the supernatant was brought to 60% saturation by the addition of a further 244 g/liter solid ammonium sulfate. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of buffer A. The protein was dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of the same buffer. The dialysis residue was cleared by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 15 min) and loaded onto a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephacryl S-300-HR gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer A. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 28 ml/h, and 3.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were analyzed for the presence of ActVB by SDS-PAGE5 5The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and assayed for FMN:NADH oxidoreductase activity as described below. Pooled peak fractions were applied to a 2.5 × 15-cm Q-Sepharose fast flow anion exchange column equilibrated in buffer B (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The column was washed with 300 ml of buffer B, and protein was eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient of KCl (0-0.3 M) in buffer B. Fractions (3.7 ml) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for FMN:NADH oxidoreductase activity. Fractions containing flavin reductase activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a stirred cell fitted with an Amicon PM10 membrane (exclusion limit, 10 kDa). The ActVB protein, ∼80% pure, was stored at −20°C in the presence of 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was approximately 8-10 mg/ml. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. ActVB protein could be further purified on a small scale by dye ligand chromatography. Nine units of ActVB in 0.5 ml of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, were applied to a small (2 ml) column of Amicon Matrix Blue A equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein was allowed to bind to the column for 30 min, and then proteins that remained unbound were removed by washing with 10 ml of phosphate buffer. ActVB was eluted with 1.5 M potassium chloride in 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.4. SDS-PAGE was carried out using the buffer system of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) in a 20% polyacrylamide gel, and protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The Pharmacia Phast gel system was used with an IEF5-8 gel to determine the isoelectric point of the protein. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford(18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar); bovine serum albumin was used to construct standard curves. Recombinant protein identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of polyvinylidene difluoride-blotted protein on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer. Exact protein molecular weights were determined on a Fission VG Bio Q Electrospray mass spectrometer. 200 pmol of protein in 20 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were used per injection. Flavin:NADH oxidoreductase activity was assayed by monitoring the decrease in absorption of NADH at 340 nm (∊ = 6.22 × 103M−1 cm−1) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25°C. Steady state kinetic measurements were performed with a 1-cm light path in a final volume of 1 ml. For routine determination of enzyme activity, 100 μM NADH and 40 μM FMN were present, and assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme. To maintain enzyme activity, enzyme dilutions were made into 10% glycerol to give a working stock solution. Solutions containing FMN were kept in the dark to avoid photoreduction. Anaerobic assays were performed in gas-tight cuvettes under argon. Solutions were de-oxygenated by bubbling through with argon gas that had been scrubbed free of oxygen. Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed on a MSE Centriscan 75 analytical ultracentrifuge, and sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on a Beckman XLA machine, using methods previously described (19Marsh E.N. Harding S.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at 20°C, and sedimentation was monitored at 280 nm using scanning absorption optics. Protein samples were made up at a concentration of 0.5-0.7 mg/ml in TES buffer, pH 7.5. ActVB was overexpressed in E. coli by placing the gene under the control of strong bacteriophage T7 φ10 promoter(13Morrison P.T. Lovett S. Gilson L.E. Kolodner R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3641-3649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subcloning strategy involved reconstructing the 5′-portion of the gene using synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig. 2), and this allowed the first 13 codons to be changed to those found in highly expressed E. coli genes(16Grosjean H. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This has been shown to improve the expression levels of some Streptomyces proteins, which are otherwise poorly expressed in E. coli due to the high GC bias of Streptomyces DNA(20Gramajo H.C. White J. Hutchinson C.R. Bibb M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6475-6483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal levels of ActVB expression were achieved by first growing the cells until late exponential phase (A600nm∼3.5-4.0) in the presence of 0.4% glucose, which represses the basal level of T7 RNA polymerase expression. Expression was induced by removing them from the glucose-containing medium by centrifugation and resuspending in fresh medium containing isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown for a further 2.5-3 h, by which time they were nearing stationary phase, and expression of ActVB was maximal. The inclusion of 10% glycerol and 50 mM phosphate, pH 6.9, in the medium increased the yield of ActVB and may have increased the proportion of soluble recombinant protein. Typically, 26 g of cells were produced from 6 liters of medium, and in general the overexpressed protein comprised 5-10% of total cell protein as judged by SDS-PAGE. ActVB was produced both in soluble form and as inclusion bodies in approximately equal amounts. The soluble protein, rather than the inclusion bodies, was purified since it was not known whether the protein could be refolded. To effect the purification, it was necessary to include 10% glycerol in all the buffers since aggregation of ActVB proved a considerable problem, and glycerol appeared to help the protein remain soluble. A purification based on size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300-HR and anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow medium resulted in ActVB protein that was more than 80% pure. Removal of the remaining proteins proved more difficult. Various chromatographic techniques, including hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose, fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Mono Q column and affinity chromatography on FMN-agarose, failed to provide significant further purification. However, nearly pure ActVB protein could be produced on a small scale by binding it to a Cibacron Blue 3GA dye column. Although this step removed nearly all the remaining contaminating proteins, recovery was only 33% on this step, and the purified ActVB actually had a slightly lower specific activity. Attempts to scale up this purification step proved unsuccessful as very substantial losses of protein were encountered. After purification by dye column chromatography, ActVB was very nearly pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The two major protein bands seen on the gel corresponded to different forms of ActVB (as discussed below), and minor contaminating bands of Mr≈ 30,000 and 35,000 were also still present. The purified protein was stable when stored at −20°C in the presence of 20% glycerol. The yields and specific activities for each step are shown in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab ActVB was found to precipitate irreversibly from solution when the pH was reduced below 6.5, which indicated a relatively high isoelectric point and restricted the choice of purification methods. The isoelectric point, calculated from the protein sequence, is 6.61, and the experimentally determined value by isoelectric focusing is 6.45. The low yields encountered in the dye column chromatography step were probably caused by the need to conduct this step at a pH close to the isoelectric point; at higher pH levels, ActVB was not bound by the column. Presumably, the losses encountered when trying to scale up the purification were due to the protein precipitating irreversibly on the column. During the expression of ActVB, a protein of lower molecular mass (≈16,000 Da) was also seen (Fig. 3). The smaller protein copurified with ActVB and had the same N-terminal sequence, indicating that it was derived from ActVB by proteolysis near the C terminus. The proportion of proteolyzed protein in the preparation could be reduced by decreasing the length of time that cells were grown after induction and by the use of proteolytic inhibitors throughout the purification. The site of proteolysis was investigated by electrospray mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum of a mixture of the two ActVB forms showed two major series of peaks. One of these was due to a species of Mr 18265 ± 2, which corresponds to ActVB from which the N-terminal methionine residue has been cleaved (calculated Mr = 18,262). The other species has an Mr of 16,645 ± 2, which would correspond to ActVB lacking the N-terminal methionine and cleaved after Cys-158 (calculated Mr = 16,642). Since it was not possible to separate the truncated protein from the full-length form, it is not clear whether it is active or not. Initial estimations of molecular weight made by gel filtration on a calibrated Pharmacia Superose-12 fast protein liquid chromatography column at pH 7.5 yielded a Mr of 32,000 for ActVB, suggesting it to be dimeric. The subunit structure was investigated in more detail by analytical ultracentrifugation. The weight-averaged molecular weight over the whole solute distribution, M°r,w, was determined at several different pH values between 5.0 and 8.5. M°r,w decreased progressively, as the pH was raised, from 31,000 ± 2000 at pH 5.0 to 25,000 ± 1000 at pH 8.5. At pH 7.5, under the conditions in which gel filtration was performed, M°r,w for ActVB was 28,000 ± 2000. Only a single symmetrical boundary was seen during sedimentation velocity, indicating that the protein exists in a rapid equilibrium between monomer and dimer forms, with higher pH promoting dissociation. The point weight average molecular weight extrapolated to zero concentration gave a value of 18,000 ± 5000, which corresponds to the Mr of the monomeric protein, as expected for a system that is in true equilibrium between monomer and dimer. The sedimentation coefficient, s20,w, at pH 7.5, was 2.93 ± 0.08 S, a value typical for globular proteins of this size. At lower pH values, higher molecular weight species were detected at the cell base, again demonstrating the propensity of the protein to aggregate when near its pI. ActVB prepared from E. coli was colorless, and the UV-visible spectrum showed no evidence for any chromogenic cofactors. Oxidoreductase activity depended on both NADH and flavin being added in the assay; no requirement for any other cofactors was apparent. The most effective substrates were NADH and FMN, but FAD and riboflavin could be turned over by the enzyme, although the Km values were much higher. Under aerobic conditions, the oxidation of NADH could be effected with catalytic amounts of FMN, suggesting that FMNH2 was being recycled by reaction with oxygen to form H2O2 and FMN. This was confirmed when the assay was performed anaerobically. NADH now reduced FMN stoichiometrically, and the absorption band at 450 nm corresponding to FMN was completely bleached when excess NADH was added (Fig. 4). When oxygen was admitted to the assay, further oxidation of NADH took place, and the absorption at 450 nm due to FMN returned. The steady state kinetic properties of the enzyme were investigated; velocities were measured at 25°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The Km for NADH was determined at various concentrations of FMN, and the data were fitted by computer. This yielded values for the true Km for NADH of 7.3 ± 0.6 μM and Kmfor FMN of 1.5 ± 0.1 μM. The Hanes plot of the data (Fig. 5) clearly demonstrates an intersecting pattern characteristic of the formation of a ternary complex between ActVB, NADH, and FMN. The specific activity of ActVB was calculated as 8.2 units/mg, which, assuming that both forms of ActVB are active, gives a value for kcat of 5 s−1. The apparent Km values for FAD and riboflavin, determined at 100 μM NADH, were 11.5 ± 0.6 and 13.5 ± 0.6 μM, respectively. The stoichiometry of FMN binding to ActVB was investigated using equilibrium ultrafiltration(21Wilson K. Wilson K. Walker J.M. Principles and Techniques of Practical Biochemistry. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1994: 223Google Scholar). A ≈10 μM solution of ActVB protein was incubated in the presence of 50 μM FMN (i.e. a saturating concentration of FMN) for 5 min, and the solution was subjected to ultrafiltration using a membrane with a 10,000-Da cut off. The concentrations of FMN in the filtrate and retentate were then determined by the absorbance at 450 nm. The FMN concentration in the retentate was 58 μM, while that in the filtrate was 43 μM; therefore, the concentration of bound FMN was 15 μM. The protein concentration in the retentate was determined as 17 μM, and hence 88% of the protein bound FMN. Given that the ActVB preparation was approximately 85% pure, we interpret this as indicating that 1 mol of FMN is bound per mol of ActVB. The cloning and sequencing of the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene cluster has afforded the opportunity to study in detail the biochemistry of polyketide assembly. ActVB is the first enzyme from this pathway to be overexpressed in E. coli and physically and kinetically characterized. The actVB gene was originally the focus of our investigation because mutations mapping to this gene abolished two chemically interesting steps, the final hydroxylation and dimerization, the enzymology of which is little explored. Initially, we thought that ActVB might catalyze either the hydroxylation or dimerization of kalafungin or dihydrokalafungin directly. However, extensive trial assays using a variety of different buffers, pH, metal ions, cofactors such as flavin, and both oxidized and reduced nicotinamide coenzymes failed to produce any evidence that ActVB could catalyze the hydroxylation or dimerization of either potential substrate. The initial suggestion that ActVB might be an oxidoreductase came from sequence similarity observed between ActVB and a component of pristinamycin IIB hydroxylase1 encoded by snaC (11Blanc V. Blanche J. Crouzet N. Jacques P. Lacroix D. Thibaut D. Zagoreg M. Patent WO 94/08014, France. 1994; Google Scholar) and, subsequently, successful complementation of an actVB mutant by snaC.2 Recently, the cloning of a FAD:NADH-dependent 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from E. coli has been reported(22Prieto M.A. Garcia J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22823-22829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme comprises two separable protein components, the smaller of which, HpaC, also has sequence similarity with ActVB. This suggests that HpaC may similarly function as flavin:NADH oxidoreductase. These enzymes may comprise a new class of reduced flavin-dependent oxidases. We subsequently confirmed that ActVB is a flavin:NADH oxidoreductase; the preferred substrate is FMN, but FAD and riboflavin are effective substrates at high concentrations. Since it was not possible to purify ActVB to homogeneity, the enzyme activity might possibly result from a contaminating protein. However, we feel this is unlikely because of the sequence similarity to SnaC and the fact that ActVB binds FMN stoichiometrically. Unusually, FMN behaves as a true substrate in this reaction rather than as a tightly bound cofactor. This is confirmed by the absence of any absorption bands attributable to flavin in the UV-visible spectrum of the purified protein, the quantitative reduction of substrate levels of FMN under anaerobic conditions in the presence of excess NADH, and steady state kinetic analysis, which clearly indicates the formation of a ternary complex of FMN and NADH with ActVB, implying direct reduction of FMN by NADH. The only well studied example in which free FMNH2 serves as a cosubstrate is the oxidation (by molecular oxygen) of aliphatic aldehydes by bacterial luciferase in luminescent bacteria. FMNH2 for this reaction is provided by FMN:NADH oxidoreductases, of which examples from Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio harveyi have recently been overexpressed in E. coli and characterized(23Zenno S. Saigo K. Kanoh H. Inouye S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lei B. Liu M. Huang S. Tu S.-C. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3552-3558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ActVB shows no homology to these enzymes and differs in structure and kinetic properties. The Vibrio oxidoreductases are monomers of approximately 25,000 Da, while ActVB is dimeric and substantially smaller, with a subunit mass of 18,400 Da. The Vibrio enzymes contain tightly bound FMN, distinct from FMN undergoing reduction, and exhibit ping-pong kinetics, implying that an intermediate reduced flavoprotein is formed. In contrast, the reduction of FMN by ActVB, as discussed above, appears to proceed via a ternary complex. The order of the hydroxylation and dimerization steps that transform dihydrokalafungin to actinorhodin is unknown. On simple chemical grounds, dimerization was favored as the first step since the phenolic hydroxyl at C-11 would direct coupling to the ortho (C-10) position. Accumulation of kalafungin by the actVB mutants was therefore taken as evidence that they were blocked in dimerization itself(9Fernández-Morano M.A. Martnez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cole S.P. Rudd B.A. Hopwood D.A. Chang C.-J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, hydroxylation could precede dimerization if the dimerase could distinguish between the two para-substituted hydroxyl groups (at C-8 and C-11) and so direct the regiochemistry of coupling to C-10 rather than C-9. Evidence that one or more genes essential for C-8 hydroxylation are located in the actVA region of the act cluster (far from the actVB gene) came from the finding that this DNA segment could cause Streptomyces sp. AM 7161, the producer of medermycin, which lacks the C-8 hydroxyl, to make mederrhodin A, which is hydroxylated at C-8(25Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Kieser H.M. Ikeda H. Duncan J. Fujii I. Rudd B.A.M. Floss H.G. Omura S. Nature. 1985; 314: 642-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, if ActVB is indeed involved in this hydroxylation step, as suggested by its similarity to HpaC and SnaC, Streptomyces sp AM 7161 must carry an equivalent gene. There are many examples in which reduced flavin is used to activate dioxygen toward hydroxylation chemistry, which occurs through the intermediacy of a flavin 4a hydroperoxide(26Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The chemistry of the dimerization is more speculative. Dihydrogeodin oxidase, one of the few enzymes catalyzing oxidative couplings that have been characterized, requires copper and uses molecular oxygen as the oxidant(27Fujii I. Iijma H. Tsukita S. Ebizaka Y. Samaka U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, flavin-mediated redox chemistry is sufficiently versatile that reduced FMN might well also play a role in the oxidative dimerization leading to actinorhodin. We are currently investigating genes within the actVA region of the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster to identify the hydroxylase and dimerase enzymes and to clarify the role of FMNH2 generated by ActVB, the timing of hydroxylation and dimerization, and the chemistry associated with these transformations.

CheY is a single domain protein that folds into a (β/α)5 topology with five parallel β-strands forming the hydrophobic core, surrounded by five α-helices. Three aspartate residues, Asp12, Asp13, and Asp57, are highly conserved within the superfamily of bacterial response regulators, and form the phosphorylation site near the carboxyl termini of the β strands. The side chain of another conserved residue Lys109 reaches into the active site and forms a strong hydrogen bond with the Asp57 side chain in the Mg2+-free, inactive form(18Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active site binds monophosphates (21Kar L. De Croos P.Z. Roman S.J. Matsumura P. Johnson M.E. Biochem.

Two other conserved sites near the active site, Thr87 and Ala88, located at the COOH terminus of the β-4 strand, lead into the 90's loop connecting β-4 to α-4. The conserved aromatic position on β-5, 106, is a tyrosine residue which assumes two widely different rotameric environments in the 1.7-Å structure of wild-type, Mg2+-free E. coli CheY. The functional roles of most of these conserved residues are known(17Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we characterize the phenotypic effect of a threonine to isoleucine mutation at position 87 in CheY identified by random mutagenesis screening and describe the refined crystal structure of this mutant at 2.1-Å resolution. Replacement of the γ-hydroxyl group of threonine by the ethyl moiety of isoleucine increases the volume and hydrophobicity of the side chain at this site. Our in vitro and in vivo results show that the T87I mutant is phosphorylatable but non-chemotactic. Since this mutant CheY protein cannot convey the chemotactic signal, the biological activity of this molecule is presumably blocked at a step after the phosphorylation event. The crystal structure of the T87I CheY mutant reveals significant structural rearrangements distal from the site of mutation, in addition to conformational changes and solvent structure rearrangement in the immediate vicinity. By comparing the mutant structure with the wild-type protein, we identify conformational rearrangements which may be involved in the biological functionalities of this region of the CheY protein. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Cultures were routinely grown in Luria Broth (1% Tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 0.5% yeast extract). Wild-type CheY was over-produced from plasmid pRL22 in E. coli-K12 strain CY15040 by inducing expression at 42°C(26Matsumura P. Rydel J.J. Linzmeier R. Vacante D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T87I mutant was expressed from a similar plasmid construct pYM31, except that strain SG2 (devoid of chemotaxis proteins) was used to eliminate contamination by wild-type CheY.TABLE I Open table in a new tab Genetic phenotypes of the mutants were characterized following established procedures. Non-chemotactic mutants were screened on motility agar plates (1% NaCl, 1% tryptone, and 0.3% agar) by measuring swarm sizes after growth for 8-10 h at 30°C. Phosphorylation assays were done as described previously by Hess, et al.(11Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I.

The reaction was stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE1 1The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. sample buffer, and the reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide) and autoradiographed. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The stability of phosphorylated CheY was determined from the kinetics of CheY's intrinsic dephosphorylation activity. This was accomplished by permitting autophosphorylation of CheA coupled to Sepharose beads, and then allowing the phosphoryl group transfer reaction to free CheY. The reaction mixture for CheA phosphorylation contained 30 μl of beads (approximately 1 μg CheA/μl bead) suspended in 20 μl of phosphorylation buffer, supplemented with 1 mM [γ32P]ATP (specific activity 0.75 μCi/nmol). The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 45 min on a rotating shaker and was stopped by washing the beads with excess phosphorylation buffer. Purified CheY protein was added to the phospho-CheA beads, and phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 30 s. Phosphorylated CheY was then separated from the CheA beads by centrifugation. Samples of phosphorylated CheY were aliquotted at different time points, where the autodephosphorylation reaction was stopped by adding 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were run on SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide). The gels were dried, autoradiographed, and scanned on a β-particle scanner (Ambis Inc.) to quantitate the 32P-label attached to CheY. T87I mutant CheY was purified to homogeneity by dye-ligand chromatography and gel filtration chromatography, as described for the wild-type protein(26Matsumura P. Rydel J.J. Linzmeier R. Vacante D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated by a Coomassie dye binding assay kit (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard(27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Purified protein stock was concentrated to ∼10-15 mg/ml by ammonium sulfate precipitation and then loaded into 20- or 30-μl microdialysis chambers which were then sealed with dialysis membranes and soaked in different solution conditions inside 20-ml glass vials. Ammonium sulfate was used as the major precipitant in acetate or Tris-HCl buffered solutions. Sodium azide was routinely added at 0.05% concentrations in all crystallization trials to suppress fungal contamination. The mutant protein could not be crystallized at acidic pH; repeated crystallization trials around pH 4.5 led to amorphous precipitates. Multiple bunches of needles and plates appeared in a few days at pH 8.3 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at 4°C. Effects of pH, temperature, ethanol, and polyethylene glycol were explored to improve the quality of crystals. Though the crystallization yield was very low, diffraction quality crystals grew as single trapezoidal plates from a mother liquor with an initial ammonium sulfate concentration of 2.7 M in Tris-HCl buffered at pH 8.3, at 4°C (these conditions are identical to those used for crystallization of wild-type CheY(18Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The crystals used for data collection grew to dimensions of 0.45 × 0.10 × 0.08 mm over a period of months. The crystals of the T87I mutant were found to be of the monoclinic space group P21. Unit cell dimensions of a = 53.59 Å, b = 71.81 Å, c = 35.83 Å, and β = 109.07° were determined from a least-squares fit of 23 intense reflections measured on an Enraf Nonius CAD4 diffractometer with 2θ settings in the range of 13.98°≤ 2θ≤ 27.36°. Assumption of 2 molecules/asymmetric unit yields a reasonable Matthews' coefficient (28Matthews B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar) of 2.39 Å3/dalton. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at the area detector facility at Argonne National Laboratory. The crystal was exposed for a total of ∼80 h in graphite monochromatized Cu Ka radiation from a rotating anode generator (50 kV, 100 mA) passing through a 0.3-mm collimator. Data were recorded at a crystal to detector distance of 100 mm on a Siemens multiwire area detector, with a swing angle of 18.5° in 2θ for a theoretical upper resolution limit of 2.04 Å. Data merging and reduction were done using the XENGEN program package(29Howard A. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-390Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The unit cell parameters of the crystal used for data collection were within 0.12% of those previously determined from CAD4 diffractometer measurements. The final data set included a total of 30,935 observations of 15,093 unique reflections ranging from ∞♦ to 2.04 Å. The unweighted absolute value R factor on intensity for merging all observations was 4.57%. Statistics for the final data set used in the structural solutions are given in Table 2.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Phasing of the structure was initiated by the results of molecular replacement calculations (30Rossmann M.G. The Molecular Replacement Method. Gordon and Breach, New York1972Google Scholar) using the software package MERLOT(31Fitzgerald P.M.D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 273-278Crossref Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The search model comprised 891 atoms (90%) of the refined 1.7-Å structure of the wild-type CheY protein. All solvent molecules and the side chain atoms of polar, solvent accessible residues were excluded from the search model, and residue 87 was modeled as an alanine. Diffraction data greater than 2σI in the resolution range 10.0-4.0 Å were used. Interpretation of the rotation function search was straightforward, with two distinct peaks confirming 2 molecules/asymmetric unit. Satisfactory solutions from the translation searches were followed by 20 cycles of R value minimization refinement of Euler angles and translation parameters. The R factor at that stage was 40.4%. The molecular replacement solutions were used as the starting model for further refinement of atomic positions using the restrained least-squares method(32Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), with a total of six stages of resolution extensions and 16 rounds of manual rebuilding of the atomic models on an interactive graphics terminal. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were refined independently and simultaneously. All atoms were refined with unit occupancies. The R factor dropped rapidly during the initial cycles of refinement as the resolution limit was increased from 3.5 to 2.5 Å. Reflections were initially given resolution dependent weightings ranging from −12.5 to −0.75, in addition to a constant weight of ∼0.5〈ΔF〉. The average temperature factor for the two molecules at this stage was 21.9 Å2. Constraints on temperature factors were released after cycle 80. The quality of the Sim-weighted electron density maps improved significantly after including data to the upper resolution limit and modeling solvent molecules. At that stage, the resolution-dependent weighting factor was set to zero, and the R factor smoothly converged to a final value of 15.6% after 245 cycles of refinement and 12 rebuilds. Two side chains of the COOH termini and the 3 residues of the N termini were not visible until very near the end. 13,198 data in the resolution range 10-2.04 Å greater than 2σI were used in the final refinement. Calculation of electron density maps and other data processing were carried out with the XTAL software package (33Hall S.R. Stewart J.M. XTAL 2.4 User's Manual. Universities of Western Australia and Maryland, Perth, Australia1988Google Scholar) and several locally developed programs. Least-squares refinement was done with the software packages PROTIN and PROFFT(32Hendrickson W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 252-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 34Finzel B.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 53-55Crossref Google Scholar). Visualization of electron density maps and model rebuilding were done using the graphics package FRODO (35Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 system. Inspection of results was done with the program insightII on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris. Plasmid pRL22ΔZ was mutagenized in vitro with hydroxylamine, and the mutants were screened for Penr and Che− (non-chemotactic) phenotypes in a ΔcheY mutant strain RP4079. One of these mutants carried a mutation at position 87 of the CheY amino acid sequence, with threonine substituted by isoleucine. Plasmid pYM31 carrying the T87I allele of CheY was not able to complement the ΔcheY mutant strain RP4079. This T87I mutant protein was further characterized functionally and structurally. The non-chemotactic phenotype of the T87I mutant would be easily explained had it lost its ability to be phosphorylated. However, T87I was found to be phosphorylatable in vitro (Fig. 1). Under the described reaction conditions, the CheA kinase was phosphorylated, and the phosphoryl group was transferred to the CheY protein in the presence of excess of CheY. Wild-type CheY can completely remove the phosphoryl group from phospho-CheA (lane 2versuslane 1). The lower amount of total radioactivity remaining in lane 2 is due to the rapid dephosphorylation activity of wild-type CheY. The T87I CheY mutant can also dephosphorylate phospho-CheA (lane 3). The band corresponding to phosphorylated T87I is more intense than that for wild-type (lane 2versuslane 3), due to T87I's slower rate of dephosphorylation (see below). Its reduced dephosphorylation activity is also responsible for the higher residual CheA-phosphate. Since the results described in Fig. 1 suggested a defect in dephosphorylation activity of the mutant protein, the stability of phosphorylated T87I was compared to that of wild-type. Wild-type- and T87I-CheY-phosphate were purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” The kinetics of dephosphorylation were monitored to obtain their first-order rate constants and half-lives (Fig. 2). These measurements show that phosphorylated T87I is approximately six times more stable than phosphorylated wild-type CheY. Other experiments show that the T87I mutant is also less susceptible to the phosphatase activity of CheZ (data not shown). The position corresponding to 87 in CheY is occupied by a hydroxyamino acid-threonine or serine in 96% of the known two-component response regulators(5Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Such a high degree of conservation within the superfamily implies an important functional role for Thr87. The possibility of Thr87 being an alternate site of phosphorylation has been previously suggested(18Volz K. Matsumura P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15511-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as a role in facilitating hydrolysis of the acylphosphate on Asp57(13Sanders D.A. Gillece-Castro B.L. Stock A.M. Burlingame A.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21770-21778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that Thr87 is not required for phosphorylation of CheY, since the T87I mutant is phosphorylated to a significant extent (Fig. 1). Moreover, the reduction of the dephosphorylation activity of the T87I mutant (Fig. 2) does not appear to be large enough to assign a catalytic role for Thr87 in that process. These results show that the T87I mutant cannot be activated by phosphorylation. A different CheY mutant from S. typhimurium, K109R, is also phosphorylatable in vitro, and also fails to generate tumbles when expressed in vivo from a multicopy plasmid(25Lukat G.S. Lee B.H. Mottonen J.M. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8348-8354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these mutants are non-chemotactic despite their ability to be phosphorylated. They presumably are blocked in event(s) subsequent to phosphorylation during the activation pathway of the CheY molecule. A similar phenotypic effect had been found in a mutation at the Thr83 position of OmpR(37Brissette R.E. Tsung K. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3749-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to Thr87 of CheY. Since the T83A mutation of OmpR can intragenically suppress the effect of non-phosphorylatable D55Q mutant in OmpR,2 2Asp55 is the site of phosphorylation in OmpR, although a D11A mutation also lost the ability to be phosphorylated (36). the Thr83 residue of OmpR could also be important in event(s) subsequent to OmpR phosphorylation. These phenotypic similarities between equivalent site mutations in homologous proteins support our functional interpretations of Thr87 in CheY. The final electron density maps from the |2Fo - Fc|αcalc and |Fo - Fj|αcalc difference Fourier calculations are clear and well defined for the entire backbone of both molecules in the asymmetric unit, except for the amino-terminal residue of molecule B. There are a total of 14 amino acid side chains for which electron density was not interpretable past Cβ: residues 19, 89, 91, 92, 122, and 125 of molecule A, and residues 3, 26, 89, 91, 92, 93, 118, and 125 of molecule B. These are all charged, solvent exposed residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) that possessed high temperature factors in the high resolution, wild-type CheY structure. The average thermal parameters for all atoms are 14.2 and 18.4 Å2, respectively, for molecules A and B (Fig. 3). The final coordinate set consists of 2070 atoms of which 1898 are protein, and 172 are solvent molecules with unit occupancies. Molecule A is modeled with 954 protein atoms and 91 associated solvent molecules and molecule B with 944 protein atoms and 81 solvent molecules. Clearly defined electron density for the Cγ-Cδ ethyl moieties at position 87 confirms the threonine to isoleucine substitution. No rotameric side chains were reliably detected in the mutant structures. Of the 7 residues that were modeled as two-state rotamers in the high resolution wild-type CheY structure, one of them, Tyr106, occurs at a conserved site in the two-component response regulator superfamily(5Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In both of the T87I mutant molecules, this residue is well ordered, exclusively occupying the external, solvated position. The significance of this restriction of rotameric arrangement of the Tyr106 side chain is discussed below. The overall structure of the central β-sheet and the topology of the surrounding α-helices are unaltered in the mutant. Positional shifts in the hydrophobic core of the mutant are minimal when compared to the wild-type structure, with root mean square differences in the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C, and O) of the β-sheet of 0.133 and 0.143 Å for molecules A and B, respectively. Shifts in atomic positions are most pronounced in the vicinity of the turn leading into the 90's loop. Details of the conformational changes associated with this region are described below. Superpositions of the wild-type and mutant structures reveal significant shifts in the backbone conformation of the protein adjacent to the site of mutation. These shifts are not due to chemical differences, since the crystallization conditions for T87I and wild-type CheY were identical. The root mean squaredifferences in positions of equivalent α carbons of the least-squares superimposed mutant and wild-type structures are summarized in Table 3. A Luzzati analysis (38Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) suggests errors on the order of 0.20- 0.40 Å for structures refined to this resolution and R factor(39Ohlendorf D.H. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 808-812Google Scholar). The root mean square differences in corresponding α-carbon positions of molecule A and molecule B range within 0.32-0.40 Å. This compares well with the 0.31-Å root mean square differences for main chain atoms of another protein, myoglobin, in two crystal forms(40Phillips Jr., G.N. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins: Struct. Funct. & Genet. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This range of values may thus be viewed as a lower practical limit in comparing different structures in different crystal packing environments. Since a visual inspection of the structural superpositions revealed significant backbone differences for only the COOH-terminal portion of the molecule past the site of mutation, root mean square errors for corresponding positions were calculated separately for the NH2-terminal (residues 3-86) and COOH-terminal portions (residues 87-129) (Table 3). The overall differences among the wild-type and the mutant molecules in the NH2-terminal two-thirds is in the lower limit of this range (root mean square deviations of 0.32 Å), but the COOH-terminal regions of molecule A and B differ from the wild-type by 0.90 and 0.68 Å, respectively. Thus the COOH-terminal portion of the T87I molecule is not just rotated as a rigid body as a result of the mutation, but there are localized distortions within this region as well. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate these differences.TABLE III Open table in a new tab Interpretations of positional shifts of macromolecules from different crystal forms (in this case, P212121 for the wild-type and P21 for T87I) can be complicated by distortions caused by different packing environments. However, the crystal form of the T87I mutant with 2 molecules/asymmetric unit provides an “internal control.” Molecular distortions due to packing alone are detectable in the two chemically equivalent but crystallographically independent mutant molecules, and those differences can be used to separate at least some of the packing effects from the true structural consequences of the mutation. This type of analysis is presented graphically in the δ distance plots of Fig. 5, where comparisons of the interatomic distances of equivalent Cα atoms were done in pairwise fashion for all three molecules ("
https://openalex.org/W2068593405,"Previously we showed that α-crystallins are autophosphorylated (Kantorow, M., and Piatigorsky, J.(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 3112-3116). Here we report that addition of 1% deoxycholate converted αA-crystallin aggregates into 80-kDa tetramers which were 10-fold more active for autophosphorylation. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of α-crystallin revealed little or no change in secondary and tertiary structures in 1% deoxycholate. αA2D, a truncated form of bovine αA that exists as a tetramer, was as active for autophosphorylation in the absence of deoxycholate as intact αA was in the presence of deoxycholate. At least one serine between amino acids 131 and 145 of bovine αA was autophosphorylated in peptide mapping experiments. Chicken αA-crystallin, which lacks the Ser-122 cAMP-dependent kinase site of bovine αA, was also autophosphorylated in the presence of deoxycholate. In contrast to αA-crystallin, autophosphorylation by αB-crystallin was not activated by deoxycholate despite its conversion to a tetrameric form, and αB was also more efficiently phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase than αA. These data suggest metabolic differences between the α-crystallin subunits that may be related to specific expression of αA in the lens and ubiquitous expression of αB in numerous normal and diseased tissues. Previously we showed that α-crystallins are autophosphorylated (Kantorow, M., and Piatigorsky, J.(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 3112-3116).

We have recently demonstrated that purified α-crystallin can be phosphorylated in the absence of cAMP by a serine-specific, Mg2+-dependent, autophosphorylation reaction (41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J.

Here we provide evidence that autophosphorylation of αA- but not αB-crystallin is activated by reducing the average molecular mass of the αA complex from approximately 800 kDa to 80 kDa, and we provide evidence for functional differences between αA- and αB-crystallin subunits with respect to phosphorylation. Bovine αA and αB were prepared from the outer cortex of bovine lenses as described elsewhere(27Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Samples of α-crystallin (1-8 mg) were solubilized in 1% deoxycholate and applied directly to the column. The elution buffer was 1% deoxycholate, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and 0.1 M NaCl. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, fractions of 2 ml were collected, and the absorbance at 280 nm was recorded. To calibrate the column, the following proteins were chromatographed in the presence of 1% deoxycholate: aldolase (158 kDa), enolase (88 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), and γ-crystallin (20 kDa). Aldolase and enolase did not dissociate under these conditions. These were carried out using a Jasco model 600 spectropolarimeter. For the near and far UV regions, 1.0-cm and 0.20-mm path length cells were used, respectively. In vitro phosphorylation reactions were carried out as specified in 20 mM imidazole HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM MgCl2, [γ-32P]ATP at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1% deoxycholate, CHAPS, n-octyl glucopyranoside, or SDS. Where indicated, crystallins were reacted with bovine heart cAMP-dependent kinase (Sigma) under identical conditions with the addition of 20 μM cAMP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10% SDS buffer (10% (w/v) SDS, 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol), loaded onto precast SDS, 14% or 4-20% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA), and electrophoresed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred (30 V for 2 h in 12 mM Tris-HCl, 96 mM glycine, 15% methanol) to nitrocellulose filters and stained with Ponceau S. Autoradiography was performed at −70°C overnight on Kodak X-Omat AR film with an intensifying screen. 1-2 mg of recombinant αA-crystallin were autophosphorylated as described above in the presence or absence of 1% deoxycholate or cAMP-dependent kinase with 5 μM [γ-32P]ATP (4500Ci/mmol). Free ATP was removed by dialysis, and the resulting protein was aminoethylated and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by scintillation counting as described(32Voorter C.E.M. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The aggregation state of αA- and αB-crystallin subunits was determined by chromatography in the presence of 1% deoxycholate, CHAPS, n-octyl glucopyranoside, or SDS. Fig. 1 is the profile of recombinant αA-crystallin chromatographed in the presence of 1% deoxycholate. The majority of αA-crystallin subunits eluted with a retention time corresponding to a molecular mass of 80 kDa, consistent with a tetramer. Aldolase tetramers (158 kDa) and enolase dimers (88 kDa) consistently ran in front of the αA tetramer. Identical results were obtained with highly purified bovine αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin (data not shown). The presence of 1% CHAPS or 1% n-octyl glucopyranoside did not result in disaggregation of αA- or αB-crystallin subunits (data not shown). As expected, 1% SDS converted αA- or αB-subunits to 20-kDa monomers when analyzed by chromatography (data not shown). Fig. 2A shows the far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of recombinant αA-crystallin in the presence of deoxycholate, SDS, and aqueous buffer. In deoxycholate (curve 2), there was a slight (10%) increase in the intensity of the spectrum (from 200-230) when compared to buffer alone (curve 1); however, no change in shape was observed. This typical CD spectrum for αA-crystallin reflects its predominantly β-structure. In contrast, major changes occurred when αA was solubilized in 1% SDS (curve 3). This spectrum suggests a significant amount of α-helical structure. SDS is known to induce helicity in nonhelical proteins. The near UV CD spectra of recombinant αA-crystallin in deoxycholate, SDS, and aqueous buffer are shown in Fig. 2B. The vibronic structure in deoxycholate and aqueous buffer was essentially the same; by contrast, the vibronic structure in SDS due to tryptophan residues at 283 nm and at 292 nm is not present, reflecting modifications in the microenvironments of tryptophan and possibly tyrosine residues. Collectively, these CD spectra indicate minor changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of αA-crystallin in 1% deoxycholate and major conformational changes upon monomerization in 1% SDS. The relative amounts of autophosphorylation of recombinant αA in the presence or absence of 1% deoxycholate, CHAPS, n-octyl glucopyranoside, and SDS were estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3). Deoxycholate activated autophosphorylation by αA (lanes 2 and 7) to levels 10 times those measured in the absence of this detergent (lanes 1 and 6). CHAPS (lanes 3 and 8) or n-octyl glucopyranoside (lanes 4 and 9), which do not disaggregate αA-crystallin, had no effect on autophosphorylation. SDS (lanes 5 and 10), which converts αA-crystallin to a monomer, promoted at most a 2-fold increase in autophosphorylation. Identical results were obtained with bovine αA-crystallin purified by isoelectric focusing in the presence of 8 M urea (data not shown). In order to test the possibility that the enhanced phosphorylation of αA-crystallin in the presence of deoxycholate was due to a nonspecific chemical effect, eight different proteins were examined in parallel with recombinant αA-crystallin for autophosphorylation (Fig. 4). While αA-crystallin was intensely labeled, only three other protein preparations (carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, and lactate dehydrogenase) showed minor radioactivity on the polyacrylamide gel. The label in the carbonic anhydrase lane migrated considerably below the major band of carbonic anhydrase, while the label in ovalbumin and lactate dehydrogenase lanes migrated slightly above the major bands of these proteins. Similar results were obtained when the reactions were conducted in the absence of deoxycholate albeit with higher background radioactivity (data not shown). In our previous study(41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), high specific activities (up to 7500 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP were used to monitor α-crystallin autophosphorylation. In the present tests, much lower specific activities (1-2 Ci/mmol) were used which decreased nonspecific labeling. We have repeated these experiments in the presence of αA-crystallin ((+) or(-)-deoxycholate) and have found only specific labeling of αA-crystallin, indicating that the phosphate group was not transferred from αA to the other proteins examined (data not shown). Previous work demonstrated that deletion of amino acids 1-63 of bovine αA-crystallin results in a tetrameric form of αA called αA2D that corresponds to the putative C-terminal domain of αA(42Merck K.B. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that tetrameric αA2D would exhibit high levels of autophosphorylation in the absence of deoxycholate, provided that amino acids 1-63 are not required for autokinase activity. Autophosphorylation of αA2D in the absence of deoxycholate (Fig. 5, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10) was at least five times that of untreated bovine αA-crystallin (relative to mass) (lanes 6 and 12) and almost as high as that of bovine αA-crystallin treated with deoxycholate (lanes 5 and 11). Unexpectedly, 1% deoxycholate (lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8) actually reduced the autophosphorylation of αA2D by approximately 50%. The autophosphorylation of a form of αA-crystallin (indicated in Fig. 3 as αA∗), identified by Western analysis as a nonreducible dimer of αA-crystallin(41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was unaffected by deoxycholate (lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). αA2D also showed a more slowly migrating, nonreducible band by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (lanes 1-4 and 7-10). This band has been designated αA2D∗ by analogy with αA∗ and is presumed to be a dimer of αA2D. In contrast to αA∗, deoxycholate significantly reduced the autophosphorylation of αA2D∗ (compare lanes 7 and 8 with deoxycholate with lanes 9 and 10 without deoxycholate). The major in vivo phosphorylation site for bovine αA-crystallin in response to exogenously added cAMP is serine 122, which is contained in the cAMP-dependent recognition site RLPS(33Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1438-1441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike bovine αA, chicken αA is not phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase (32Voorter C.E.M. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) because it contains alanine instead of serine at 122. Thus, chicken αA was examined for autokinase activity to determine if serines other than 122 could be involved in autophosphorylation. Chicken αA-crystallin exhibited deoxycholate-activated autophosphorylation (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 4). There was almost no autophosphorylation of the chicken αA- or αB-crystallin polypeptides in the absence of deoxycholate (lane 3). In contrast to its effect on αA, deoxycholate did not stimulate autophosphorylation of αB (lane 4). Since chicken αA has alanine substituted for serine at position 122, its autophosphorylation must involve other amino acids. Autophosphorylation of chicken αA-crystallin eliminates serine 122 as an autophosphorylation site in that species and makes it unlikely that Ser-122 is autophosphorylated in the bovine polypeptide, as it is in the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation reaction(32Voorter C.E.M. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, no differences were observed in autophosphorylation of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of αA-crystallin purified from bovine lens by isoelectric focusing (data not shown). Consequently, we attempted to identify the autophosphorylated amino acids of bovine αA-crystallin by reversed-phase HPLC separation of tryptic peptides. A control test on αA phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase confirmed the labeling of tryptic peptide T16-T17a (the result of incomplete cleavage between T16 and T17a, which always occurs), indicative of Ser-122 phosphorylation(32Voorter C.E.M. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three separate preparations of autophosphorylated bovine recombinant αA-crystallin were examined. In the first, αA was autophosphorylated in the absence of deoxycholate, aminoethylated, digested with trypsin, and subjected to HPLC chromatography. Only two major tryptic peptides were labeled (Fig. 7). These are probably incompletely digested T17 and T17b, which include amino acids 131-145 ((C)SLSADGMLTFSGPK), containing three serines as potential phosphorylation sites. There was no evidence for the labeling of T17a, which contains serine 122 and eluted earlier. Another experiment in which αA was autophosphorylated in the presence of deoxycholate produced the same chromatographic profile as αA labeled in the absence of deoxycholate (data not shown), indicating that autophosphorylation in the presence of deoxycholate is serine-specific as it is in its absence (41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and results in the same phosphorylated peptides produced in the absence of deoxycholate. No radioactive peptides were obtained by HPLC chromatography in the third test in which the autophosphorylated αA-crystallin was not aminoethylated (data not shown). Since aminoethylation is required for solubilization of T17, this result is consistent with the autophosphorylated amino acid(s) being on T17b in this experiment. Since deoxycholate reduces the multisubunit αB-crystallin complexes to tetramers (see above), it was used to test whether aggregate size affects the autophosphorylation of purified bovine αB-crystallin as it does αA-crystallin (Fig. 8). The presence of deoxycholate, which activates the autophosphorylation of αA-crystallin, had no positive effect on the autophosphorylation of αB-crystallin (lanes 2 and 7). Neither the slight inhibition by deoxycholate (compare lanes 6 and 7) nor the weak stimulation by CHAPS (lane 8) and n-octyl glucopyranoside (lane 9) of autophosphorylation of αB-crystallin were consistently reproducible. As reported previously(41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and unlike its modest enhancement of αA autophosphorylation, SDS did not stimulate the autophosphorylation of αB-crystallin (lanes 5 and 10). To further investigate possible phosphorylation differences between αA- and αB-crystallin subunits, each was reacted with cAMP-dependent kinase (Fig. 9). When 10 μg of each crystallin subunit were treated with incrementally smaller amounts of bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of 20 μM cAMP, it was found that 20 ng of kinase phosphorylated αB (lanes 5 and 7) at least 10 times more efficiently than αA (lanes 6 and 8). Equal amounts of phosphorylation were obtained with amounts of kinase greater than 500 ng (data not shown). Several bands (lanes 7 and 8) migrating below the major αA and αB bands were also labeled. These radioactive bands are barely visible by staining and probably represent αA and αB degradation products. Shown for comparison are autophosphorylation reactions using the same amounts of αB (lanes 1 and 3) and αA (lanes 2 and 4) in the presence of 1% deoxycholate. It is noteworthy that αA was labeled to a much higher extent by autophosphorylation in the presence of deoxycholate than by treatment with 20 ng of cAMP-dependent kinase (compare lanes 4 and 8). The present results show that tetramers of αA-crystallin have much higher autophosphorylation activity than do endogenous high molecular weight aggregates. Deoxycholate (but not CHAPS or n-octyl glucopyranoside) disaggregates recombinant or purified bovine αA from 300-1000-kDa aggregates to 80-kDa tetramers that autophosphorylate 10 times more actively than the original aggregates. The CD results showed that 1% deoxycholate had little or no effect on the secondary and tertiary structure of αA-crystallin, supporting the hypothesis that tetramerization and not conformational changes are responsible for the increase in autophosphorylation activity. Consistent with this, αA2D, a recombinant form of αA lacking amino acids 1-63 and shown to exist as a tetramer(42Merck K.B. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), is almost as active for autophosphorylation in the absence of deoxycholate as intact αA in the presence of deoxycholate. The αA2D results also indicate that increased αA autophosphorylation in the presence of deoxycholate is the result of tetramerization and not chemical enhancement by deoxycholate. It is noteworthy that a theoretical model of the oligomeric structure of α-crystallin based on tetrameric building blocks has been recently advanced(43Wistow G. Exp. Eye Res. 1993; 56: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A relationship between disaggregation and phosphorylation has been established for several heat shock proteins which, like α-crystallin, form high molecular weight aggregates. These include the small heat shock protein HSP 25/27, which disaggregates upon in vivo phosphorylation(44Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein BIP/GRP78, which disaggregates upon in vitro autophosphorylation(45Carlino A. Toledo H. Skaleris D. DeLisio R. Weissbach H. Brot N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2081-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and supermolecular organization have been shown to abolish the ability of HSP 25 to inhibit actin polymerization(46Benndorf R. Hayess K. Ryazantsev S. Wieske M. Behlke J. Lutsch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20780-20784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparable to levels reported for other autophosphorylation reactions (47Tawa P. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7917-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the proportion of autophosphorylated α-crystallin subunits does not exceed 3%(41Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3112-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, autophosphorylation of α-crystallin is most likely a self-limiting reaction restricted to a small population of α-crystallin polypeptides. Indeed, bovine α-crystallin has been recently demonstrated to exist in at least two subpopulations that differ in shape and are not interconvertible(48van Haeringen B. van den Bogaerde M.R. Eden D. van Grondelle R. Bloemendal M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interaction between total bovine α-crystallin and ATP has been characterized by equilibrium binding studies, tryptophan fluorescence, and 31P NMR(49Palmisano D.V. Groth-Vasselli B. Farnsworth P.N. Reddy M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 50Reddy M.C. Palmisano D.V. Groth-Vasselli B. Farnsworth P.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1578-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These studies indicated binding of ATP to α-crystallin at a ratio of one ATP to two α-crystallin subunits with an affinity constant of 8.1 × 103M−1. Autophosphorylation of α-crystallin may also be limited by other covalent modifications. One of these is serine/threonine-specific addition of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) by glycosyltransferase(51Roquemore E.P. Dell A. Morris H.R. Panico M. Reason A.J. Savoy L.-A. Wistow G.J. Zigler Jr., J.S. Earles B.J. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc has been mapped to serine 162 in bovine αA-crystallin which is located in a region shown to be phosphorylated(36Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Kleiman N.J. Spector A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the cAMP-dependent kinase, glycosyltransferase, and autophosphorylation reactions may compete for modification of specific serines in vivo. The small proportion of autophosphorylated α-crystallin polypeptides is one of the principal difficulties we have in unequivocally identifying the autophosphorylated αA serine(s). Although we have yet to identify the exact αA autophosphorylation site(s), our data clearly rule out the involvement of serine 122 and suggest the involvement of at least two phosphorylated peptides. Chicken αA-crystallin, which lacks the Ser-122 cAMPdependent kinase recognition site of bovine αA, exhibits autophosphorylation in the presence of deoxycholate, excluding Ser-122 as an autophosphorylation site in this species. This finding suggests that autophosphorylation may be an important mechanism for αA phosphorylation that is conserved between species. Our analysis of tryptic peptides by reversed-phase HPLC ruled out the involvement of serine 122 in bovine αA autophosphorylation and indicated the involvement of two peptides containing amino acids 131-145. Three serines in addition to Ser-122 between amino acids 122 and 173 have been reported to be phosphorylated in bovine αA in vivo(34Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Kleiman N.J. Spector A. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although serines 122 and 148 are contained in the R/KXXS cAMP-dependent kinase recognition motif, they are also contained in the sequence XP(S/T)X which is a partial recognition motif for the mitogen-activated protein kinases(52Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar). This partial mitogen-activated protein kinase motif is shared by bovine αA serines 169 and 172, the phosphorylated penultimate serine of βB2(53Kleiman N.J. Chiesa R. Gawinowicz Kolks M. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14978-14983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylated serines 45 and 59 of bovine αB-crystallin(36Chiesa R. Gawinowicz-Kolks M.A. Kleiman N.J. Spector A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, one may speculate that in addition to cAMP-dependent kinase phosphorylation and autophosphorylation, mitogen-activated protein kinases or yet unknown kinases specific for this sequence may also be involved in crystallin phosphorylation. HSP 25/27, which is closely related to the α-crystallins(24Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has been demonstrated to be phosphorylated at two S6 kinase II-like recognition sites (54Landry J. Lambert H. Zhou M. Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Anderson C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 794-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by mitogen-activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 2(55Stokoe D. Cambell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 56Stokoe D. Engel K. Cambell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that HSP 25/27 is phosphorylated in a protein kinase cascade that involves an upstream activator, an HSP 25/27 enhancer, and an HSP 25/27 kinase (57Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar, 58Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Crowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatava J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Our data show that αA- and αB-crystallin polypeptides have pronounced differences in their ability to autophosphorylate and be phosphorylated by exogenous protein kinase(s). Unlike αA-crystallin, tetramerization of αB in the presence of deoxycholate had no effect on autophosphorylation. Moreover, αB-crystallin was phosphorylated to a higher degree than αA-crystallin when each was treated with low levels of cAMP-dependent kinase. These data suggest the possibility that functional differences may be associated with the phosphorylation of αA- and αB-crystallin polypeptides. For example, αA, but not αB, has been localized to the lens membrane (59Mulders J.W.M. Stokkermans J. Leunissen J.A.M. Benedetti E.L. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) where autophosphorylation could regulate its ability to associate with yet unidentified proteins. Another difference between αA and αB is that only the latter is a substrate for transglutaminase(60Groenen P.J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These differences may account for the fact that only αB-crystallin is present in numerous non-lens tissues and is overexpressed in a variety of diseases (see (19Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 69: 155-201Google Scholar) and (21de Jong W.W. Leunissen J.A.M. Voorter C.E.M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar) for additional references). In summary, our data provide structural requirements for α-crystallin autophosphorylation and demonstrate differences between αA and αB with respect to their phosphorylation properties. Further studies are required to explore whether these differences are related to the more specific expression of αA-crystallin in the lens and the ubiquitous expression of αB-crystallin in numerous normal and diseased tissues. In any event, defining the requirements for α-crystallin autophosphorylation is a first step toward understanding how autophosphorylation might regulate the structure and function of this shsp/chaperone protein.

Using transiently transfected HEK 293 cells, we studied the molecular mechanism underlying calcium channel stimulation by proteolytic treatment. Perfusion of HEK cells, coexpressing the human cardiac (hHT) α1α2, and β3 subunits, with 1 mg/ml of trypsin or carboxypeptidase A, increased the peak amplitude of the calcium channel current 3-4-fold without affecting the voltage dependence. Similar results were obtained in HEK cells cotransfected with hHT α1 and α2 or with α1 alone, suggesting that modification of the α1 subunit itself is responsible for the current enhancement by proteolysis. To further characterize the modification of the α1 subunit by trypsin, we expressed a deletion mutant in which part of the carboxyl-terminal tail up to amino acid 1673 was removed. The expressed calcium channel currents no longer responded to intracellular application of the proteases; however, a 3-fold higher current density as well as faster inactivation compared with the wild type was observed. The results provide evidence that a specific region of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the cardiac α1 subunit is an important regulatory segment that may serve as a critical component of the gating machinery that influences both inactivation properties as well as channel availability.

Voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels play a major role in excitation-contraction coupling of cardiac muscle. One of the physiologically important features of these channels is their ability to respond to β-adrenergic stimulation with enhanced activity, contributing to an increase in cardiac contractility. There is accumulating evidence that the increase in activity is due to phosphorylation of the calcium channel protein itself or a closely associated protein ((1McDonald T.F. Pelzer S. Trautwein W. Pelzer D.J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 365-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar) and references therein). The loci of the channel proteins that may be involved in this stimulation are as yet unknown and in fact are controversial(2Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev.

It was shown some years ago that the major structural determinants of voltage-gated ion channels are accessible to internally perfused proteases, leading to modification in function(8Armstrong C.M.

Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, intracellular application of trypsin dramatically increased the amplitude of the calcium current (ICa)(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Addition of isoproterenol, subsequent to trypsin treatment, did not further increase the current amplitude, and the enhancement of ICa could not be blocked by inhibitors of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In an obverse experiment, ICa up-modulated by isoproterenol was insensitive to trypsin. From these findings, the authors (13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) speculated that trypsin removed an “inactivation gate” that is normally controlled by phosphorylation. However, up to now no structural proof of this hypothesis is available. Furthermore, the action of trypsin on the cardiac L-type calcium channels at the molecular level is unclear. In view of the accepted heterooligomeric structure of the cardiac calcium channel complex, i.e. there are four subunits(2Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Kuniyasu A. Oka K. Ide-Yamada T. Hatakana T. Abe T. Nakayama H. Kanaoka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), proteolytic modification could modify any and all of the subunits. In the present study, using transiently transfected HEK293 cells, we have demonstrated that intracellular trypsin or carboxypeptidase A treatment functionally modifies primarily a specific region of the carboxyl terminus of the α1 subunit. A cassette harboring the altered region of the hHT-1 clone (15Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke B. Olde Weghuis D. Klöckner U. Wakamori M. Wang J.-J. Melvin D.

A. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction (Roche Molecular Systems) mutagenesis procedure. Preparative amplifications utilized the following primers for 20 cycles: 5′-GGTGCCCCCTGCAGGTG-3′ and 5′-GTCTAGACCTACAGGCCACCGGCCCTCCTG-3′. The restriction sites Sse8387I and XbaI are underlined, respectively. The amber stop codon introduced is shown in boldfacetype. The amplification product was isolated from a 2% sieving agarose gel, subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) via blunt end ligation, and was sequenced. The verified cassette was then used to replace the Sse8387I(6143)-XbaI(polylinker) fragment of hHT-1. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a clone encoding the β3 subunit from human cardiac mRNA. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from surgically removed human cardiac samples by the acidic guanidium isothiocyanate method(16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated by the standard oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography(17Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5173) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was done using 200 ng of poly(A)+ RNA, oligo(dT)18 as primer, and 100 units of SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The resultant first strand cDNA pool was subjected to polymerase chain reaction according to the suggestions of the manufacturer of the Vent™ polymerase. After denaturing and heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase at 95°C for 3 min, the sample was subjected to 39 cycles of thermal cycling at 60°C for 1 min followed by 72°C for 1 min. The primers were: 5′-CCCATGTATGACGACTCCTACC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGAGGCTGTCAGTAGCTATCC-3′. The 1.4-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product was isolated from a preparative agarose gel, subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) via blunt end ligation to the EcoRV site, and was sequenced. The sequence was found to be identical to that published by Collin et al.(18Collin T. Lory P. Taviaux S. Cortieu C. Guilbault P. Berta P. Nargeot J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The coding region of the human cardiac α1 clone (hHT-1) was removed using HindIII (5′-polylinker site) and HpaI(8046) cleavages, while the pAGS-3 vector (19Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) was cut with NotI (polylinker), filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to produce blunt ends, and then cut with HindIII (polylinker). The fragments were ligated, and the construct was verified by restriction analysis. The skeletal muscle α2 clone as well as the Hβ3 clone were transferred to pAGS-3 using HindIII-NotI sites. The resultant expression plasmids were verified by restriction mapping. For the transient expression of the hHT α1, α2 and Hβ3 subunits, cDNA expression plasmids were transfected by the Ca2+-phosphate method (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) into HEK293 cells in a molar ratio of 1:2:3, respectively. Whole cell recordings were conducted at room temperature (20-22°C) using standard techniques(21Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15066) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings were done 24-72 h after transfection of the HEK 293 cells. The patch electrodes were filled with an internal solution containing (in mM) 130 CsCl, 4 ATP, 5 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, l0 HEPES/CsOH (pH 7.4). In bathing solution, composed of (in mM) 40 BaCl2 or 40 CaCl2 as indicated, 90 tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted with KOH to 7.4), no inward directed currents were detected in nontransfected cells or in cells transfected with α2 and β subunits. The expressed currents were identified as L-type calcium channel currents due to their sensitivity to 1,4-dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonists and agonists. The inactivation kinetics were fitted with the following equation: I = Io+I1exp - t/τinact. Statistical significance was analyzed using the Student's t test (p < 0.05). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. In native cardiac cells, intracellular application of trypsin caused a 3-4-fold increase in calcium channel current(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results in HEK cells in which hHT α1, α2, and β3 were coexpressed. Intracellular perfusion with 1 mg/ml trypsin slowly increased the peak amplitude of the barium current (peak IBa). After a delay of 5 min, IBa rose from −278 to −1105 pA (Fig. 1A). No increase was observed when heat-inactivated trypsin was perfused (n = 10), indicating that the channel modification we observed was specific to the proteolytic action of trypsin. In addition to this striking increase in peak IBa, the inactivation time constant of IBa decreased during this time period from 161 to 104 ms (Fig. 1B). To study the effects of trypsin on voltage-dependent activation of the calcium channel, we constructed current-voltage relationships shortly after establishing the whole cell configuration and again 10 min later. Under control conditions, the peak IBa had a threshold at approximately −20 mV and reached maximum at 20 mV. In the presence of trypsin, no significant shifts in the threshold or in the potential of maximum inward current were observed (Fig. 1C). The half-potential of activation was 4.1 mV 1 min after establishing the whole cell configuration and 3.2 mV 9 min later. These observations show that the region of the calcium channel complex that is responsible for voltage-dependent activation is not modulated by the proteolytic action of trypsin. Trypsin cleaves uniformly at arginine and lysine residues(22Stryer L. Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freemann and Co., New York1988: 226Google Scholar). To focus on the carboxyl-terminal region, we employed carboxypeptidase A, which is an exopeptidase that catalyzes the removal of amino acid residues sequentially from the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1D). Cell dialysis with 1 mg/ml carboxypeptidase A increased peak IBa within 12 min from −423 to −1076 pA (the average increase was 2.41 ± 0.5 (n = 4)) and accelerated the inactivation time course of the expressed current. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that both the enhancement of the calcium channel current as well as acceleration of the inactivation time course are caused by proteolysis of the carboxyl terminus of one or more of the calcium channel subunits. In the next set of experiments, we addressed the question which subunit(s) of the calcium channel complex are involved in the proteolytic enhancement of IBa. Two currents are shown on the leftpanel of Fig. 2A, elicited by coexpression of hHT α1 and α2 subunits and recorded 1 and 11 min after establishing the whole cell configuration. Intracellular dialysis with trypsin increased IBa from −59 to −286 pA and accelerated the inactivation time course of the expressed current from 510 to 305 ms. In five cells, the average stimulation of peak IBa was 2.98 ± 0.51. This value is not statistically different from the increase of peak IBa in cells coexpressing all three subunits (α1, α2, and β3). No modification of the voltage dependence of peak IBa by the proteolytic treatment was observed (Fig. 2B, left). These experiments provide evidence that expression of a β subunit is not a prerequisite for proteolytically induced calcium channel stimulation. In cells transfected only with the α1 subunit, within 10 min trypsin increased peak IBa from −49 to −135 pA and decreased the inactivation time constant from 470 to 261 ms (Fig. 2A, right). On average, trypsin increased IBa, within 8-15 min, by a factor of 3.37 ± 0.35 (n = 6). When we compared the current-voltage relationship before and after trypsin treatment, no appreciable difference in the threshold or in the potential of the maximum inward current was observed (Fig. 2B, right). The results show that proteolytic modification of the α1 subunit is solely responsible for the stimulation of the calcium channel current and the shortening of inactivation time. To examine whether the current stimulation depends on the charge carrier used, we performed experiments with 40 mM Ca2+ instead of 40 mM Ba2+ (Fig. 2C). Since the calcium current (ICa) induced by expression of the α1 subunit alone was very small, we augmented ICa (−18 pA) by adding the calcium agonist (+)S202-7911 1The abbreviation used is: (+)S202-791isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-pyridine carboxylate. (1 μM) to the bath solution. Within 12 min after establishing the whole cell configuration, intracellular application of trypsin increased peak ICa from −196 to −686 pA and accelerated the inactivation time course of ICa (Fig. 2C). 11 min later, the current still had a peak amplitude of −643 pA and inactivated with a time constant of 242 ms. Remarkably, even after this long period of trypsin perfusion, no slowing of the inactivation time course was observed, as has been reported for trypsin dialysis of cardiac myocytes(12Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Our observation that proteolytic treatment of HEK cells did not decelerate the inactivation time course of the expressed ICa is further confirmed by the results obtained in HEK cells expressing all three calcium channel subunits where peak ICa was increased by a factor of 3.7 ± 1.4 (n = 3) without any slowing of the inactivation time course. From these results, we conclude that the distal portion of the carboxyl-terminal tail contributes significantly to voltage-dependent but not to calcium-dependent inactivation. isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-pyridine carboxylate. A comparison of typical IBas induced by coexpression of wild type α1, α2, and β3 subunits before (left) and during (middle) trypsin perfusion and an IBa induced by coexpression of α2 and β3 subunits with a deletion mutant α1 subunit (right), where the carboxyl terminus was removed up to amino acid 1673 (α1Δ1673 mutant), is shown in Fig. 3A. In HEK cells coexpressing the wild type α1, intracellular perfusion of trypsin increased peak IBa within 10 min from −344 to −1329 pA and accelerated inactivation, and the time constant decreased from 185 to 124 ms. The shape and amplitude of the trypsin-enhanced IBa are very similar to the same parameters of the current induced by coexpression of the mutant α1Δ1673. The peak amplitude reached a level of −1305 pA and decayed with a time constant of 117 ms. The current densities and inactivation time courses of the trypsin-stimulated current were (using the wild type α1), on average, very similar to those obtained by expression of the mutant α1Δ1673 without trypsin treatment (Fig. 3B), suggesting that trypsin, by removing a specific segment of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the wild type α1 subunit, increases the amplitude of the calcium channel current. This is further substantiated by an experiment in which we perfused a HEK cell coexpressing α1Δl673, α2, and β3 with the same concentration of trypsin that caused a 3-fold increase of peak IBa in cells expressing wild type α1 subunit alone. Even after 15 min of perfusion, no increase of peak IBa was detected (Fig. 3C). The current had a similar shape 1 min and 15 min after establishing the whole cell configuration (Fig. 3C, inset). No increase of the calcium channel current was detectable in any of the eight cells tested. This reinforces that the part of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the α1 subunit that is digested by proteolytic treatment with trypsin or carboxypeptidase A was removed by mutagenesis and is responsible for the proteolytically induced effects observed. In a few experiments, carboxypeptidase A was tested and acted in the same way as trypsin (data not shown). External application of trypsin or carboxypeptidase A was without effect (data not shown). It is of interest that in a recent report (23Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) currents elicited by the coexpression of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of cardiac α1 in Xenopus oocytes were 4-6-fold larger than those of the wild type α1 subunit. Intracellular perfusion of HEK cells coexpressing wild type α1, α2, and β3 subunits with trypsin increased IBa to an extent similar to that reported for trypsin stimulation of class C calcium channel currents in cardiac myocytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, and the A7r5 cell line(4Klöckner U. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 412: 82Google Scholar, 13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Obejero-Paz C.A. Jones S.W. Scarpa A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 1127-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In all three cell types, intracellularly applied trypsin enhanced the amplitude of the calcium channel current 3-4-fold without changing its voltage dependence. Our results demonstrate that proteolytic stimulation of cardiac L-type calcium currents is due to digestion of cytoplasmic regions of the carboxyl terminus of the α1 subunit. Since no enhancement of peak IBa was observed in HEK cells expressing the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant Δ1673, it is obvious that digestion of amino acids proximal to amino acid 1673 does not result in any further increase of the calcium channel current. In cardiac myocytes, a 10-fold slowing of the inactivation time course of the calcium current was observed exclusively with Ca2+ as the charge carrier(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a phenomenon which we never observed in our experiments. In this respect, the recombinant cardiac calcium channels expressed in HEK cells resemble more the “smooth muscle type” than the “cardiac muscle type” calcium channel. In smooth muscle cells, no significant effect of trypsin treatment on the inactivation time course of ICa has been reported(4Klöckner U. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 412: 82Google Scholar, 24Obejero-Paz C.A. Jones S.W. Scarpa A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 1127-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using Ba2+ as the charge carrier, we observed an acceleration in the inactivation time course of the expressed currents upon intracellular application of trypsin, similarly to that reported for the native calcium channel(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). From these results, we suggest that the carboxyl terminus must be an important constituent of the calcium channel protein that is intimately involved in the voltage-dependent inactivation process. It might be argued that trypsin affects other structures of the calcium channel protein that are involved in the inactivation process(30Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the equally fast inactivation of IBas induced by coexpression of the mutant α1Δ1673 subunit and the lack of any trypsin effect in this mutant clearly show that the removal of part of the carboxyl terminus is responsible for the faster inactivation time course of IBa. This does not exclude other regions of α1 regulating inactivation such as IS6 and flanking regions(30Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). One possibility is that folding of the distal region of the carboxyl terminus of the α1 subunit may influence the voltage sensor-induced changes in motif IS6 and flanking regions(30Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that distinct portions of skeletal, cardiac, and neuronal type calcium channel α1 subunits influence the channel kinetics(28Tanabe T. Adams B.A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1991; 352: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Nakai J. Adams B.A. Imoto K. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although the involvement of the carboxyl terminus has not yet been suggested. The similar increase in current density and acceleration of inactivation either with Ba2+ or Ca2+ as charge carrier indicates the possibility that the E-F hand (31Babitch J. Nature. 1990; 346: 321-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on the carboxyl-terminal tail may not play a critical role in proteolytic modulation of channel function(32Leon M. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These observations shed new light on the molecular nature of the inactivation of calcium channels. Thus far, certain constituents of the multiple inactivation machineries were identified for K+, Na+, and Ca2+ channels (8, 9, 11, 12, 25, 30, 32, 33, 36). It has been shown that removal, replacement, or mutagenesis of these segments slows or eliminates certain inactivation processes. Calcium channels carry several segments that can influence kinetic properties. The carboxyl-terminal region of calcium channels is unique in that it is also involved in regulating the availability of the channel for pore opening, resulting in increased open state probability(23Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these two groups of phenomena are just two aspects of the same molecular mechanism or whether they can be described by two independent mechanisms is open for further experimentation. In native cardiac myocytes, it has been shown that the effects of intracellular trypsin application and stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor by isoproterenol are not additive but saturable. This leads to speculation that trypsin, in a manner similar to β-adrenergic-induced phosphorylation, removes the blocking action of part of the unphosphorylated α1 subunit(13Hescheler J. Trautwein W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 404: 259-274Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it is very difficult to obtain direct evidence for protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of recombinant calcium channels (2Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Kleppisch T. Pedersen K. Strübing C. Bosse-Doenecke E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Hescheler J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2502-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Since the deleted part of the α1Δ1673 mutant subunit encompasses only one consensus phosphorylation site, i.e. Ser1940, it is tempting to speculate that this serine is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, as has been proposed earlier(5Hell J.W.

Kokubun S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our finding that trypsin increased IBa elicited by expression of the α1 subunit alone may be viewed as an apparent contradiction to our previous experiments using the skeletal muscle α1 subunit (α1S) stably transfected into mouse L-cells without and with a β1a subunit. Intracellular trypsin treatment of cells coexpressing α1S and β1a amplified IBa by 3-4-fold, accompanied by a slowing of the current kinetics. In the absence of a β subunit, the α1S was unaffected by trypsin or carboxypeptidase A(25Lory P. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1421-1424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The observations for the skeletal muscle isoform are clearly consistent with the notion that proteolytic digestion abolishes the α1-β interaction, which does not appear to be the case at least functionally, in cardiac muscle. Recently, the α1-β interaction site was mapped and found to be located on the intracellular connecting loop of motifs I and II of various α1 subunit isoforms(26Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle α1 subunit has an obligatory requirement for the β subunit to mimic the native state(35Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Nature. 1991; 352: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), whereas cardiac α1 alone functions similar to the native-like channel (15Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke B. Olde Weghuis D. Klöckner U. Wakamori M. Wang J.-J. Melvin D. Varadi G. Schwartz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6228-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the skeletal α1 subunit does not appear to influence the expressed current(27Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Tanabe T. Nature. 1992; 360: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), an observation clearly opposite to the present data in which a region on the carboxyl-terminal tail of the cardiac α1 subunit has a significant influence on channel kinetics. The corresponding segments on skeletal and cardiac α1 subunits clearly define distinct functional domains. We feel, therefore, that our present results provide definitive evidence for an important qualitative difference in the regulation of cardiac and skeletal L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Recognition of the role of the carboxyl terminus in the inactivation process illustrates the multiple ways in which nature provides different but perhaps related structures (30Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P.

https://openalex.org/W2002518981,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with recombinant interleukin (IL)-1β, and the metabolism of exogenous linoleic acid was studied. High performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and chiral analysis revealed that HUVEC enzymatically convert linoleic acid mainly into 13-(S)hydroxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic (13-HODE) and 9-(R)hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acids, which may isomerize toward all-trans compounds. IL-1β increased the formation of all octadecanoids in a time- and dose-dependent manner with similar EC50 (approximately 1 unit/ml). The apparent Km values of linoleic acid were 15.59 ± 8.39 and 152.9 ± 84 μM (p < 0.05) in IL-1β-treated cells and controls, respectively, indicating a higher substrate affinity in cells stimulated with IL-1β. Ratios of S/R enantiomers for the hydroxyoctadecanoids produced by untreated and IL-1β-treated cells were similar to those from isolated cyclooxygenases (COXs), whereas isolated 15-lipoxygenase yielded 13-HODE with a strict S configuration. The formation of octadecanoids was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by several COX inhibitors in both controls and IL-1β-treated cells, COX2 selective inhibitors being more effective on IL-1β-treated cells than on controls. COX1 and COX2 protein levels increased less than 2-fold and 8-fold, respectively, after IL-1β treatment. The specificity of COX inhibitors was proven since they did not inhibit 13-HODE formation by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Overall, these results indicate that COXs are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of linoleic acid in HUVEC, and IL-1β increases it by inducing the expression of new enzyme, mainly COX2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with recombinant interleukin (IL)-1β, and the metabolism of exogenous linoleic acid was studied. High performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and chiral analysis revealed that HUVEC enzymatically convert linoleic acid mainly into 13-(S)hydroxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic (13-HODE) and 9-(R)hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acids, which may isomerize toward all-trans compounds. IL-1β increased the formation of all octadecanoids in a time- and dose-dependent manner with similar EC50 (approximately 1 unit/ml). The apparent Km values of linoleic acid were 15.59 ± 8.39 and 152.9 ± 84 μM (p < 0.05) in IL-1β-treated cells and controls, respectively, indicating a higher substrate affinity in cells stimulated with IL-1β. Ratios of S/R enantiomers for the hydroxyoctadecanoids produced by untreated and IL-1β-treated cells were similar to those from isolated cyclooxygenases (COXs), whereas isolated 15-lipoxygenase yielded 13-HODE with a strict S configuration. The formation of octadecanoids was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by several COX inhibitors in both controls and IL-1β-treated cells, COX2 selective inhibitors being more effective on IL-1β-treated cells than on controls. COX1 and COX2 protein levels increased less than 2-fold and 8-fold, respectively, after IL-1β treatment.

COX1 is expressed in a constitutive manner, and COX2 is the inducible isoenzyme by mitogens, which is overexpressed in many inflammatory processes(36Smith W.L. Am. J.

In general, enzymatic oxidation of linoleic acid may involve both COX and 15-lipoxygenase activities(9Reinaud O. Delaforge M. Boucher J.L. Rocchiccioli F. Mansuy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Minor nonenzymatic isomerizations toward 13- and 9-hydroxy all-trans-isomers from both 13-HPODE(Z,E) and 9-HPODE(E,Z) and/or the corresponding hydroxides may also occur. Isomerization of very small amounts of 9-HODE(E,Z) toward 13-HODE(Z,E) and 13-HODE(Z,E) toward 9-HODE(E,Z) were also observed. These nonenzymatic isomerizations (mainly all-trans, which are thermodynamically favorable) probably occurred due to rearrangements of radical species formed during the incubation and/or further manipulation.Exposure of HUVEC to IL-1β increases their ability to transform linoleic acid into HODEs enzymatically in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Blocking the stimulating action of IL-1β on the biosynthesis of HODEs by cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicates that de novo synthesis of protein is required for this effect to occur. Biosynthesis of 13-HODE may be catalyzed by both COX and 15-lipoxygenase(9Reinaud O. Delaforge M. Boucher J.L. Rocchiccioli F. Mansuy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5344-5354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas significant amounts of 9-HODE are produced by COX(38Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5344-5354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The absence of significant differences in the stimulating effect of IL-1β in the production of 13- and 9-HODEs in terms of EC50 suggests the involvement of a common enzymatic pathway in the effect of IL-1β on the production of the two position isomers.The exact enzymatic pathway for the biosynthesis of HODEs in HUVEC, specially 13-HODE, remains controversial. The location of the hydroxyl group in the molecule of 15-HETE or 13-HODE led other authors to infer the presence of 15-lipoxygenase in HUVEC, but as mentioned before 15-HETE and 13-HODE can also be formed by COX(38Hamberg M.

The 15-lipoxygenase origin of 13-HODE and 15-HETE in nonstimulated HUVEC has been claimed by several authors, although no direct evidence of this has been reported(4Buchanan M.R. Haas T.A. Lagarde M.

Haemostasis. 1985; 53: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) first reported the production by HUVEC of a lipoxygenase-derived product, lipoxygenase X, which inhibited adhesion of platelets to endothelial surface; lipoxygenase X was later identified as 13-HODE(4Buchanan M.R. Haas T.A. Lagarde M. Guichardant M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16056-16059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors studied the content of free 13-HODE in HUVEC, showing that it is dependent on the turnover of linoleic acid in the triacylglycerol pool(21Haas T.A. Bertomeu M.C. Bastida E. Buchanan M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The amount of free 13-HODE present in cells after stimulation with thrombin or calcium ionophore was lower than in controls(4Buchanan M.R. Haas T.A. Lagarde M. Guichardant M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16056-16059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin and calcium ionophore cause the release of free arachidonic acid; interestingly, it was found that when HUVEC were incubated with 200 μM labeled arachidonic acid lipoxygenase X (13-HODE) was formed(5Buchanan M.R. Butt R.W. Magas Z. Van Ryn J. Hirsh J. Nazir D.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 53: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fact that the cytosolic fraction was able to produce 13-HODE, together with the inhibition by ETYA, was supporting evidence for the conclusion that 15-lipoxygenase is the origin of 13-HODE in HUVEC(4Buchanan M.R.

A. 1989; 86: 1046-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) has been used as the supporting evidence for the 15-lipoxygenase involvement in such events in HUVEC. ETYA actually is a competitive arachidonic acid analogue that inhibits many dioxygenases including COXs(54Tobias L.D. Hamilton J.C. Lipids. 1979; 14: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 55Anderson K.M. Ondrey F. Harrys J.E. Clin. Biochem. 1992; 25: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that 50 μM ETYA completely inhibited HODEs formation by HUVEC (not shown). Furthermore, we found that NDGA inhibited 13-HODE(Z,E) formation by HUVEC in a concentration-dependent manner. However, NDGA showed higher efficiency in inhibiting 9-HODE(E,Z) than 13-HODE(Z,E), especially in resting cells. NDGA is a potent inhibitor of lipoxygenases but also inhibits COX (40López S. Vila L. Breviario F. de Castellarnau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450(56Agarwal R. Wang Z.Y. Bik D.P. Mukhtar H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 620-624PubMed Google Scholar). Since among PMN at least eosinophils express 15-lipoxygenase(57Soberman R.J. Harper T.W. Betteridge D. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1990; 32: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we used PMN suspensions to examine the specificity of the inhibitors. NDGA was 40-fold and 7-fold less potent, in terms of IC50, in inhibiting 13-HODE formation by untreated and IL-1β-treated HUVEC, respectively, when compared with its effect on PMN. Based on these results we think that caution should be exercised in defining the role of 15-lipoxygenase in the metabolic pathways based only on inhibitions by NDGA or ETYA.The limited effect of aspirin in the production of 15-HETE has also been considered as supportive evidence of the 15-lipoxygenase origin of this eicosanoid in endothelial cells(41Takayama H.

We reported that aspirin, even at 1 mM concentration, was unable to suppress totally 15-HETE formation in HUVEC and human dermal fibroblasts treated with IL-1β(40López S. Vila L. Breviario F. de Castellarnau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 52Godessart N. Vila L. Puig L. de Moragas J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 98-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon can be explained not only by the 15-lipoxygenase origin of 15-HETE but also by the COX2 origin, since 15-HETE is the main eicosanoid produced by COX2 treated with aspirin(60Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, 100 μM aspirin totally inhibited all octadecanoids, even 13-HODE(Z,E), in both controls and IL-1β-treated cells (not shown).All COX inhibitors tested in the present study inhibited the synthesis of both products 13-HODE(Z,E) and 9-HODE(E,Z) in untreated as well as in IL-1β-treated cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The greater ability to inhibit 9-HODE(E,Z) than 13-HODE(Z,E) formation, especially in untreated cells, was a common feature of all inhibitors tested (Table 1). This is consistent with the lower inhibitory strength of indomethacin on 15-HETE than 11-HETE or prostaglandin formation from arachidonic acid by HUVEC and dermal fibroblasts(40López S. Vila L. Breviario F. de Castellarnau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 52Godessart N. Vila L. Puig L. de Moragas J.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 98-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, only indomethacin was able to suppress HODEs formation totally at the concentrations used. Consistent with reports that 100 μM indomethacin did not inhibit 15-lipoxygenase activity in cells transfected with reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase(61Sigal E. Grunberger D. Highland E. Gross C. Dixon R.A.F. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5113-5120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that 50 μM indomethacin did not inhibit 13-HODE(Z,E) formation by PMN.Furthermore, lipoxygenases render compounds with a strict S stereospecificity(62Kühn H. Schewe T. Rapoport S.M. Adv. Enzymol. 1986; 58: 273-311PubMed Google Scholar), whereas COX forms R- and S-isomer mixtures(49Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Results from chiral analysis indicate that the main products formed by HUVEC, irrespective of their treatment or not with IL-1β, were 13(S)-HODE and 9(R)-HODE. The ratio of enantiomers in controls or IL-1β-treated HUVEC is quite similar to that obtained when HODEs were synthesized by isolated COX1 or COX2 independently and is different from that obtained in the incubations of linoleic acid with reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase, which yielded only 13(S)-HODE(Z,E). These results agree with those obtained by Hamberg and Samuelsson(49Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 617: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Baer et al.(63Baer A.N. Costello P.B. Green F.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Commun. 1989; 161: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with pure COX, bovine aortic endothelial cells, and human leukocytes, respectively.Recent studies have shown that 15-lipoxygenase expressed in macrophages is regulated by inflammatory cytokines, and only IL-4 induces specifically 15-lipoxygenase mRNA and enzyme activity in cultured human monocytes(64Conrad D.J. Kühn H. Mulkins M. Highland E. Sigal E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We were unable to find 15-lipoxygenase mRNA in untreated and in IL-4- or IL-1β-treated HUVEC, whereas IL-4, but not IL-1β, effectively induced 15-lipoxygenase mRNA on cultured monocytes (40López S. Vila L. Breviario F. de Castellarnau C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1170: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Overall, these results indicate that formation of both 13-HODE(Z,E) and 9-HODE(E,Z) was mediated by COX rather than by 15-lipoxygenase in resting and IL-1β-treated HUVEC.According to data reported by Jones et al.(35Jones D.A. Carlton D. McIntyre M.T. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9049-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both COX1 and COX2 were detected in nonstimulated HUVEC. COX1 was induced slightly by IL-1β (less than 2-fold), whereas COX2 increased 8-fold as a result of IL-1β exposure. The ratio of HODE biosynthetic activity between IL-1β-treated cells and controls at substrate concentrations ≤ 50 μM (from data in Fig. 5: IL-1β/controls 5-8) is consistent, but not absolutely coincident, with the increment of COX proteins. Kinetics of linoleic acid concentration show a 1.5-fold increase of apparent Vmax and a 9.8-fold decrease in the apparent Km in IL-1β-treated cells with respect to controls. That the increased amount of COX2 caused by IL-1β was observed mainly as a reduction of the apparent Kmvalue may be due to a combination of two factors: (i) the higher affinity of COX2 than COX1 for linoleic acid, and (ii) a substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations which led to an undervalued Vmax, even though the experimental values fit the Michaelis-Menten equation.The higher strength of COX2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and 6-MNA (60Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) for inhibiting HODEs in IL-1β-treated cells is consistent with the fact that IL-1β induced mainly the expression of new COX2. The strength of COX2-selective inhibitors NS-398 and 6-MNA on HODE formation was similar to those reported with arachidonic acid as substrate(60Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2089339494,"Previously, we have demonstrated that the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) from Escherichia coli is capable of utilizing an in vitro generated minihelix consisting of the anticodon stem and loop sequence of E. coli tRNATyr (Curnow, A. W., Kung, F. L., Koch, K. A., and Garcia, G. A.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 5239-5246). This suggests that the tRNA structural motifs necessary for recognition comprise a loop at the end of a short helix. To gain further insight into the structural requirements for TGT recognition, we have investigated the conformation of this minimal substrate. Thermal denaturation studies and kinetic analyses at 20 and 37°C indicate that this minihelix is predominantly melted at 37°C and that the melted conformation is not a substrate for TGT. This is confirmed by the determination that a non-helical analogue of the minihelix is not a substrate for TGT at either temperature. Two additional minihelices designed to be stable at 37°C, ECYMH (a 4-base pair extension of the previous minihelix) and SCDMH (a yeast tRNAAsp analogue of ECYMH), were generated and characterized. Finally, several sequence mutants of SCDMH, focusing on the G30U40 base pair and U33G34U35 loop sequence, have been produced, and kinetic parameter determinations have been performed at 37°C. Our results are consistent with a recent report (Nakanishi, S., Ueda, T., Hori, H., Yamazaki, N., Okada, N., and Watanabe, K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32221-32225) indicating that a UGU sequence in a 7-base loop is the minimal requirement for TGT recognition. Previously, we have demonstrated that the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) from Escherichia coli is capable of utilizing an in vitro generated minihelix consisting of the anticodon stem and loop sequence of E. coli tRNATyr (Curnow, A.

Chem. 269, 32221-32225) indicating that a UGU sequence in a 7-base loop is the minimal requirement for TGT recognition. A key enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA with queuine (7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine) is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT,1 1The abbreviation used is: TGTtRNA-guanine transglycosylase. 1The abbreviation used is: TGTtRNA-guanine transglycosylase. EC 2.4.2.29)(1Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, TGT catalyzes the replacement of guanine 34 in the tRNA anticodon with a queuine precursor, preQ1 (7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine). preQ1 is, in turn, further modified to queuine. The overall process results in the substitution of guanine 34 with queuine and maturation of the tRNA molecule. The tRNAs (tRNATyr, tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, and tRNAHis), which act as substrates for this enzyme, contain the anticodon sequence, GUN, where N may be any base(2Harada F. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Tsang T.H. Buck M. Ames B.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 741: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has initiated the evaluation of the molecular recognition of tRNA by TGT from E. coli using in vitro generated tRNA analogues based upon E. coli tRNATyr (Fig. 1).Comparison of the activity of totally unmodified tRNATyr (Fig. 1, ECY2) to that for Q-deficient but otherwise modified tRNATyr isolated from a tgt-deficient clone of E. coli revealed that the other modified bases do not appear to play a significant role in the recognition of tRNA by TGT (4Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that a dimeric conformer of tRNATyr has a slightly higher Km than monomeric tRNATyr (ECY2) but has an equal maximum velocity (5Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Generation and evaluation of truncated analogues of tRNATyr indicated that ECY2-A1, an analogue corresponding to the 17-base anticodon arm of tRNATyr, was found to have a Km value only 6-fold higher than full-length tRNATyr and Vmax/Km only 40-fold lower (4Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that, other than the anticodon arm, the majority of the tRNA structure has very little effect upon recognition by TGT.Thermal denaturation curves can be utilized to elucidate the solution conformation adopted by nucleic acids(6Puglisi J.D. Tinoco I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Such studies in our system of tRNA analogues indicate that ECY2-A1 has a Tm≈33°C(7Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (Abstr. 519): 1348Google Scholar). Thus, at 37°C ECY2-A1 is mostly denatured, suggesting that the specificity constant (Vmax/Km) calculated for ECY2-A1 at this temperature may be artificially low since the analogue will exist in a predominantly melted conformation. A recent report by Nakanishi et al.(8Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that a YUGU sequence in the anticodon loop of cognate tRNAs is the minimal requirement for recognition by TGT. These analyses were carried out at 37°C using 5-base pair stem minihelices similar to ECY2-A1. Presumably, the minihelices studied will also be predominantly melted under the conditions of the assay, leaving the results subject to question.We have pursued several routes to a stable framework upon which to base our sequence mutation studies. Kinetic parameters were determined for several analogues at 20°C, a temperature at which ECY2-A1 will adopt a stable minihelix conformation. A non-helical analogue of ECY2-A1 was also generated and evaluated to investigate the possibility that the enzyme required sequence but not conformational information for recognition. The anticodon arm of ECY2-A1 was extended by 4 base pairs to provide a minihelix with enhanced stability. A yeast tRNAAsp analogue of this minihelix was used as a framework for several sequence mutations (Fig. 2) and kinetic evaluation at 37°C.Figure 2:The primary nucleotide sequences and probable secondary structures of minihelices derived from yeast tRNAAsp. A, SCDMH includes the yeast tRNAAsp anticodon domain with a 3-base pair extension of the helical stem. There are seven sequence mutants whose names are derived by adding the site of the mutation, using the standard numbering system for tRNAs, to SCDMH. Guanine 34 has been underlined, and the site of mutation is indicated with an arrow pointing to the mutation. The mutant indicated by the parentheses is a double mutant. B, there are two loop conformation analogues. In SCDMH6BL cytosine 38 has been deleted to form a 6-base loop, and in SCDMH8BL a cytosine residue has been added between positions 38 and 39 to form an 8-base loop.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsChemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, Boehringer Mannheim, and Life Technologies, Inc. Nucleoside triphosphates and RNasin were from Boehringer Mannheim. BstNI restriction endonuclease was from Stratagene. [8-14C]Guanine was from Moravek Biochemicals.

The absorbance was monitored at 260 nm for 2 μM RNA solutions in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl. The temperature was increased at the rate of 1°C/min with absorbance readings taken through a range from 10 to 90°C. The denaturation curves for ECY1 and ECY2 (the full-length modified and unmodified analogues of E. coli tRNATyr), ECY2-A1 (the anticodon microhelix), ECY2-A1NH (the nonhelical analogue of ECY2-A1), and ECYMH and SCDMH (the extended minihelix analogues) are presented in Fig. 3. The total change in absorbance for SCDMH is less than that for the other analogues, most likely due to the fact that SCDMH contains no adenosine, which contributes largely to the UV absorbance change.Figure 3:Thermal denaturation curves for several tRNA analogues. The relative absorbances at 260 nm for ECY2-A1 (1), ECY2-A1NH (2), ECY2 (3), ECY1 (4), ECYMH (5), and SCDMH (6) are plotted versus temperature.

The concentration of [8-14C]guanine was maintained at 10 μM (about 10 × Km(4Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) while the concentration of the tRNA substrates was varied from 0.5 to 100 μM. The general procedure included incubating a 300-μl mixture of buffer, substrate, and 12.6 μg/ml TGT at either 20 or 37°C. At 3-min intervals 70-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture. For the longer tRNA sequences, >30 nucleotides, the aliquots were quenched in 5% trichloroacetic acid and filtered onto glass fiber filters (Whatman, GF/C). The filters were then washed 3 times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with ethanol, dried, and quantitated via liquid scintillation counting. For the shorter sequences, <30 nucleotides, 10 μl of 3 M NaOAc, pH 5.3, was added to the aliquots, which were then precipitated with 1.5 ml of ethanol and collected on glass fiber filters (Whatman, GF/C). The filters were then washed 3 times with ethanol, dried, and quantitated via liquid scintillation counting. Initial velocities were determined by linear regression, and from that data Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined by nonlinear regression and are displayed in Fig. 4 and 5. The kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax, and Vmax/Km) along with the standard errors of the fits for the structural analogues at 37 and 20°C are shown in Table 1 and for the sequence mutants are shown in Table 2. Analogues for which the guanine incorporation was below the limit of detection (about 0.1% of full-length tRNA activity) at 100 μM analogue are denoted as having no detectable activity.Figure 4:Michaelis-Menten plots of E. coli tRNATyr structural analogues.

Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This was demonstrated by employing RNA substrates varying widely in gross structure while maintaining a common motif, the anticodon arm. Such structural analogues have included full-length E. coli tRNATyr, a dimeric form of E. coli tRNATyr, and the anticodon arm itself. For example, at 37°C the anticodon arm minihelix has a Vmax/Km that is 40-fold lower and a Km that is only 6-fold higher than that for the full-length tRNATyr, suggesting that the predominate effect of the loss of tRNA structure is upon catalysis. This is similar to the conclusion drawn by Gu and Santi(14Gu X. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2999-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), who reported that an 11-base oligoribonucleotide corresponding to the TψC arm of tRNAVal has a kcat/Km that is 300-fold lower and a Km that is 5-fold higher than that for the full-length tRNAVal for the tRNA (m5US4) methyltransferase and concluded that the effect was primarily upon catalysis. A recent report from Nakanishi et al. (8Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has probed further into tRNA substrate recognition by the E. coli TGT. In their study, the kinetic parameters for several sequence mutants of an RNA minihelix, similar to ECY-A1, derived from the anticodon arm of E. coli tRNAHis have been determined. The conclusion drawn by the authors was that the YUGU sequence in the anticodon loop is the minimum requirement for recognition.The UV thermal denaturation curves in Fig. 3 indicate that the modified full-length tRNA (ECY1) has a higher Tm than the unmodified tRNA (ECY2) (61 versus 56°C). These results are consistent with earlier findings from studies with tRNAVal and tRNAPhe, which indicate that base modifications enhance the stability of the tRNA native conformation (15Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 16Derrick W.B. Horowitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4948-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, the curves for the full-length analogues have gradual transitions possibly due to the melting of the tertiary base interactions followed by melting of the base pairs of the four helices, which make up the secondary structure. The transitions for the smaller analogues, ECYMH, SCDMH, and ECY2-A1, which presumably have no tertiary interactions, are much sharper and most probably simply reflect the melting of the base pairing in the helices. Perhaps the most important aspect of the thermal denaturation profiles for the minihelices is that the Tm for ECY2-A1 is ≈33°C and the Tm for ECYMH ≈75°C. If TGT requires an intact helix leading into the anticodon loop for recognition, then the kinetic parameters that were calculated for ECY2-A1 at 37°C must be artificially low since at this temperature this analogue will be predominantly denatured.Our earlier results indicated that the anticodon arm alone is sufficient for binding and catalysis to occur but did not eliminate the possibility that TGT recognizes oligoribonucleotides containing the UGU sequence in the absence of a defined tertiary structure. The fact that there is no energy coupling for this enzymic reaction suggests that binding energy is used to catalyze this base exchange. If so, it is reasonable to assume that a significant amount of tRNA tertiary structure may be required to provide this binding energy. To address this question we generated ECY2-A1NH. In this analogue, we have replaced the 3′ side of the helix (5 bases) with the reverse of the 5′ sequence yielding an analogue incapable of helix formation (Fig. 1). We attempted to determine the kinetic parameters for this analogue at both 20 and 37°C and found that in concentrations up to 100 μM the analogue had no detectable activity at either temperature. The analogue also does not seem to interact with TGT via a previously published bandshift assay (5Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Finally the analogue is incapable of inhibiting the incorporation of guanine into the full-length cognate tRNA (data not shown). These results suggest that the non-helical analogue does not, to any significant extent, interact with TGT and that some degree of loop/helix structure is required for TGT catalysis to occur.The relative activities of the tRNA analogues with TGT observed at 20°C are very much like the trend we previously reported at 37°C (Table 1). It is important to note that each analogue displays a Vmax approximately 5-fold lower at 20 than at 37°C, reflecting an overall lower activity for TGT at 20°C. At the lower temperature ECYMH has a larger Km than at 37°C, while ECY2 has an identical Km at both temperatures. The change in Km for ECYMH can be partially explained by the larger error for the values at 20°C where the enzyme is less active. The relative Vmax/Kmratio for ECYMH is similar at both temperatures, suggesting that the analogue is stable at both temperatures. The relative Vmax/Km ratio for ECY2-A1 decreases from a factor of 40 at 37°C to a factor of 10 at 20°C, suggesting that at 37°C only 25% of the analogue is in the stable helical conformation required for TGT recognition. This is consistent with the thermal denaturation curve for ECY2-A1 shown in Fig. 3. We conclude that an RNA minihelix with an extended stem, stable at 37°C, is the minimum stable framework suitable for sequence specificity studies.We have selected a yeast tRNAAsp minihelix framework, SCDMH, in which to carry out site-specific sequence mutations to investigate the specific bases involved in substrate recognition by TGT. The x-ray crystal structure for the full-length yeast tRNAAsp has been determined(17Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 18Dumas P. Ebel J.P. Giege R. Moras D. Thierry J.C. Westhof E.

A. 1988; 44: 112-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Future modeling studies will use this information to generate structures for our minihelices, which will be used as a framework in which to interpret our kinetic results. Prior to performing sequence mutations, it is necessary to determine the kinetic parameters for SCDMH with TGT. Comparing the results for ECYMH (Table 1) to the results for SCDMH (Table 2) we find that the analogues have similar kinetic parameters.The sequence mutation studies began in the anticodon loop focusing on the U33G34U35 sequence, which was inferred to be the major determinant for TGT recognition in earlier sequence homology studies(3Tsang T.H. Buck M. Ames B.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 741: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The only loop sequence mutant that has any detectable activity is SCDMHU33C, which has an 80-fold loss in substrate specificity relative to SCDMH. The other mutants showed no detectable activity in concentrations up to 100 μM. The inactivity of the one-base insertion, SCDMH8BL, and one-base deletion, SCDMH6BL, mutants (Table 2) suggests that the size of the loop, and presumably its conformation, is also vital for recognition of tRNA substrates by TGT.G30 is conserved among the TGT cognate tRNAs, being base paired either with C40 or U40. The establishment of a canonical base pair, G30C40 in SCDMH, results in a modest increase in substrate specificity while mutation to A30U40 results in a 2-fold loss in substrate specificity. Mutation of the G30U40 pair to give C30G40 yields a 7-fold loss in substrate specificity relative to SCDMH. These results suggest that the enzyme does not have a specific amino acid-base interaction at position 30; however, it may be that the conformation imparted in the loop by this base pair plays a role in the recognition of tRNA by TGT.We have reached a very similar conclusion to Nakanishi et al.(8Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the U33G34U35 sequence found in tRNAs, which are active as substrates for TGT, is the major recognition determinant within the anticodon domain. However, we conclude that the 5 base pairs (three G-C and two A-U) in the anticodon stem investigated by Nakanishi et al. are inadequate to maintain the stable helical structure necessary for TGT catalysis to occur optimally at 37°C. Thus, additional structural stabilization is necessary in order to form a true minimal substrate. This stabilization may be provided by: 1) lowering the assay temperature, 2) additional canonical base pairs and the tertiary interactions of distant bases, in the instance of the full-length tRNA, or 3) by extending the anticodon stem by 3-4 base pairs, in the instance of a minihelix analogue.It should be noted that these studies are designed to investigate positive recognition elements only and do not address the possibility that negative recognition elements for TGT exist elsewhere in the non-cognate tRNA structure. A key enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA with queuine (7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-1-cyclopenten-3-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine) is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT,1 1The abbreviation used is: TGTtRNA-guanine transglycosylase. 1The abbreviation used is: TGTtRNA-guanine transglycosylase. EC 2.4.2.29)(1Okada N. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3061-3066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, TGT catalyzes the replacement of guanine 34 in the tRNA anticodon with a queuine precursor, preQ1 (7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine). preQ1 is, in turn, further modified to queuine. The overall process results in the substitution of guanine 34 with queuine and maturation of the tRNA molecule. The tRNAs (tRNATyr, tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, and tRNAHis), which act as substrates for this enzyme, contain the anticodon sequence, GUN, where N may be any base(2Harada F. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Tsang T.H. Buck M. Ames B.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 741: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has initiated the evaluation of the molecular recognition of tRNA by TGT from E. coli using in vitro generated tRNA analogues based upon E. coli tRNATyr (Fig. 1). tRNA-guanine transglycosylase. tRNA-guanine transglycosylase. Comparison of the activity of totally unmodified tRNATyr (Fig. 1, ECY2) to that for Q-deficient but otherwise modified tRNATyr isolated from a tgt-deficient clone of E. coli revealed that the other modified bases do not appear to play a significant role in the recognition of tRNA by TGT (4Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that a dimeric conformer of tRNATyr has a slightly higher Km than monomeric tRNATyr (ECY2) but has an equal maximum velocity (5Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Generation and evaluation of truncated analogues of tRNATyr indicated that ECY2-A1, an analogue corresponding to the 17-base anticodon arm of tRNATyr, was found to have a Km value only 6-fold higher than full-length tRNATyr and Vmax/Km only 40-fold lower (4Curnow A.W. Kung F.L. Koch K.A. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5239-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that, other than the anticodon arm, the majority of the tRNA structure has very little effect upon recognition by TGT. Thermal denaturation curves can be utilized to elucidate the solution conformation adopted by nucleic acids(6Puglisi J.D. Tinoco I. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 304-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Such studies in our system of tRNA analogues indicate that ECY2-A1 has a Tm≈33°C(7Curnow A.W. Garcia G.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (Abstr. 519): 1348Google Scholar). Thus, at 37°C ECY2-A1 is mostly denatured, suggesting that the specificity constant (Vmax/Km) calculated for ECY2-A1 at this temperature may be artificially low since the analogue will exist in a predominantly melted conformation. A recent report by Nakanishi et al.(8Nakanishi S. Ueda T. Hori H. Yamazaki N. Okada N. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32221-32225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that a YUGU sequence in the anticodon loop of cognate tRNAs is the minimal requirement for recognition by TGT. These analyses were carried out at 37°C using 5-base pair stem minihelices similar to ECY2-A1. Presumably, the minihelices studied will also be predominantly melted under the conditions of the assay, leaving the results subject to question. We have pursued several routes to a stable framework upon which to base our sequence mutation studies. Kinetic parameters were determined for several analogues at 20°C, a temperature at which ECY2-A1 will adopt a stable minihelix conformation. A non-helical analogue of ECY2-A1 was also generated and evaluated to investigate the possibility that the enzyme required sequence but not conformational information for recognition. The anticodon arm of ECY2-A1 was extended by 4 base pairs to provide a minihelix with enhanced stability. A yeast tRNAAsp analogue of this minihelix was used as a framework for several sequence mutations (Fig. 2) and kinetic evaluation at 37°C.

The absorbance was monitored at 260 nm for 2 μM RNA solutions in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl. The temperature was increased at the rate of 1°C/min with absorbance readings taken through a range from 10 to 90°C. The denaturation curves for ECY1 and ECY2 (the full-length modified and unmodified analogues of E. coli tRNATyr), ECY2-A1 (the anticodon microhelix), ECY2-A1NH (the nonhelical analogue of ECY2-A1), and ECYMH and SCDMH (the extended minihelix analogues) are presented in Fig. 3. The total change in absorbance for SCDMH is less than that for the other analogues, most likely due to the fact that SCDMH contains no adenosin"

The stimulatory effect was noticeable at nanomolar concentrations of staurosporine, and a treatment time of >4 h was required for staurosporine to elicit the effect. At 40 nM and with a treatment time of 16 h, the stimulation of the transport activity was 3.5-6.0-fold. None of the several other protein kinase inhibitors tested had similar effect except KT 5720, a protein kinase A inhibitor, which showed a small but significant (∼1.4-fold) stimulatory effect at a concentration of 5 μM. Blockade of RNA synthesis and protein synthesis in the cells prevented completely the stimulation of the transport activity induced by staurosporine. The stimulation was observed not only in intact cells but also in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from staurosporine-treated cells. The stimulation was accompanied by a 5-7-fold increase in the steady state levels of the transporter-specific mRNAs, by a 7-fold increase in the maximal velocity of the transport process, and by a 6-fold increase in the transporter density in the plasma membrane. Even though both staurosporine and cholera toxin had similar effects on the serotonin transport activity in these cells, the effect was not additive when the cells were treated with both reagents together. While treatment of the cells with cholera toxin markedly elevated intracellular levels of cAMP, staurosporine did not have any effect on the cellular levels of this cyclic nucleotide. It is concluded that staurosporine up-regulates the serotonin transport activity in JAR cells by increasing the steady state levels of the serotonin transporter mRNA and by the consequent increase in the transporter density in the plasma membrane and that the process involves a cAMP-independent signaling pathway.

INTRODUCTIONThe Na+- and Cl−-coupled serotonin transporter that is expressed in the serotonergic neurons, platelets, and placenta is a target for cocaine and antidepressants. Molecular cloning studies have demonstrated that a single gene codes for the transporter in neuronal and non-neuronal cells(1Ramamoorthy S. Bauman A.L. Moore K.R. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Chang A.S.

Human placental choriocarcinoma cells express a serotonin transporter which is identical to the transporter present in normal tissues(4Cool D.R. Leibach F.H. Bhalla V.K. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15750-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have proved to be very useful in studies involving the regulation of the human serotonin transporter(4Cool D.R. Leibach F.H. Bhalla V.K. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, the serotonin transporter is up-regulated by cAMP(4Cool D.R. Leibach F.H. Bhalla V.K. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15750-15757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the regulation involves transcriptional activation(5Ramamoorthy S. Cool D.R. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Melikian H.E. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin-dependent processes also participate in the regulation of the transporter, presumably involving phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the transporter protein(6Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence in other cell types for regulation of the serotonin transporter by additional cellular signaling pathways such as Ca2+(7Nishio H. Nezasa K. Nakata Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), protein kinase C(8Myers C.L. Lazo J.S. Pitt B.R. Am. J.

However, these signaling pathways modulate the serotonin transporter activity rapidly and the underlying mechanism apparently involves covalent modification of the transporter protein without altering the transporter density. Therefore, cAMP is the only cellular signal thus far known which has been shown to regulate the serotonin transporter by transcriptional activation. The influence of cAMP on the serotonin transporter is not selective for the choriocarcinoma cells since a similar role for cAMP in the regulation of the serotonin transporter has been demonstrated in the brain(13Foguet M. Hartikka J.A. Schmuck K. Lubbert H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The present study identifies a second cellular signaling pathway involved in the transcriptional activation of the serotonin transporter in choriocarcinoma cells, and this pathway is mediated by staurosporine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe JAR and BeWo human placental choriocarcinoma cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Culture media (RPMI 1640 and F-12), penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum, cholera toxin, iproniazid, imipramine, serotonin, staurosporine, prostaglandin E1, apotransferrin, hydrocortisone, thyroxine, phorbol esters, cycloheximide, and actinomycin D were from Sigma. Human recombinant insulin was from Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Princeton, NJ). Protein kinase inhibitors were from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA) and from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Paroxetine was obtained from Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Betchworth, Surrey, United Kingdom). 5-[1,2-3H]Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) binoxalate (specific radioactivity, 25.4 Ci/mmol), L-[3-3H]alanine (specific radioactivity, 76.9 Ci/mmol), and [125I]RTI-551 1The abbreviations used are: RTI-552β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropanePMA4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. (specific radioactivity, 2200 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. [2-3H]Taurine (specific radioactivity, 30.0 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St Louis, MO).Culture of JAR and BeWo CellsThe cells were cultured with either RPMI 1640 medium (JAR) or F-12 nutrient mixture (BeWo) as described previously(14Kulanthaivel P. Cool D.R. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Trypsin-released cells were seeded in 35-mm Petri dishes at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/dish and allowed to grow as a monolayer. Twenty-four h after subculturing, the medium was replaced with a hormonally defined medium which did not contain fetal bovine serum. The defined medium consisted of either RPMI 1640 or F-12 nutrient mixture, supplemented with insulin (5 μg/ml), apotransferrin (5 μg/ml), prostaglandin E1 (2.5 × 10−5 mg/ml), hydrocortisone (5 × 10−8M), and thyroxine (5 × 10−12M). Treatment with different reagents was carried out for indicated time periods in the defined media prior to uptake measurements.Uptake Measurements in CellsThe dishes containing monolayer cultures of the cells were taken out of the incubator and let stand at room temperature for 2 h. The culture medium was then aspirated, and the cells were washed once with the uptake buffer. One ml of uptake buffer containing radiolabeled substrate (serotonin, alanine, or taurine) was added to the cells and incubated for 3 min. Uptake was terminated by aspirating the buffer and subsequently washing the cells three times with fresh uptake buffer. The cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.2 N NaOH, 1% SDS, and the lysate was transferred to scintillation vials for quantitation of radioactivity. The composition of the uptake buffer was 25 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 5 mM glucose, and 0.1 mM iproniazid, an inhibitor of monoamine oxidases. Serotonin uptake that occurred independent of the serotonin transporter (i.e. diffusion) was determined by measuring the uptake in the presence of imipramine (0.1 mM), and this component was always <10% of total uptake measured in the absence of imipramine.Determination of cAMP and cGMPJAR cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At the end of 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with a hormonally defined medium. When present, staurosporine and cholera toxin were added to this medium at a concentration of 40 nM and 100 ng/ml, respectively. The incubation was continued for 16 h. In cases where the treatment of the cells with staurosporine or cholera toxin was only for 2 h, the cells were incubated with the defined medium for 14 h, following which staurosporine or cholera toxin was added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, cell cultures were washed with ice-cold buffer and lysed in 1 ml of 0.1 N HCl. After 30 min, the acid medium was collected and stored frozen until use. Measurement of cAMP and cGMP in these samples was done by radioimmunoassay as described previously (15Marczin N. Ryan U.S. Catravas J.D. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 326-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Preparation of Plasma Membrane Vesicles from Cultured JAR CellsThe cells were cultured in 225-cm2 flasks for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fetal bovine serum (10%), after which the medium was replaced with the hormonally defined medium containing either dimethyl sulfoxide (control) or staurosporine (40 nM) in dimethyl sulfoxide. The cells were then incubated for 16 h, following which plasma membrane vesicles were prepared from these cells as described previously(6Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were suspended in 10 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5, containing 75 mM potassium gluconate, 130 mM mannitol, 2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM KF for serotonin uptake measurements and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 230 mM mannitol, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM EGTA, and 10 mM KF for RTI-55 binding measurements. Protein concentration of the final membrane suspension was determined and adjusted to 1 mg/ml (RTI-55 binding) or 2.5 mg/ml (serotonin uptake).Uptake Measurements in Membrane VesiclesUptake of serotonin in JAR cell plasma membrane vesicles was measured by the rapid filtration method as described earlier(16Balkovetz D.F.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1818-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The uptake medium was 150 mM NaCl buffered with 10 mM HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5. Uptake was measured with a 15-s incubation and at a serotonin concentration of 0.2 μM. Serotonin uptake that occurred by diffusion was determined by measuring the uptake in the presence of 0.1 mM imipramine. This value was subtracted from total uptake to determine the transporter-mediated uptake.RTI-55 BindingEquilibrium binding of [125I]RTI-55 to the JAR cell plasma membranes was assayed (6Jayanthi L.D. Ramamoorthy S. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14424-14429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating the membranes (50 μg of membrane protein) with different concentrations of the ligand (0.025-1 nM) at room temperature for 1 h in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The binding buffer was 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgSO4. The binding was terminated by addition of 3 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) followed by filtration of the mixture on a GF/F glass fiber filter (0.7-μm pore size) which had been presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. The filter was washed with 3 × 5 ml of the ice-cold stop buffer, and the radioactivity associated with the filter was determined using a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 5 μM paroxetine.Isolation of Poly(A)+ RNA and Northern AnalysisPoly(A)+ RNA was isolated from JAR cells using FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Northern hybridization was carried out as described earlier (5Ramamoorthy S. Cool D.R. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Melikian H.E. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) under high stringency conditions using 32P-labeled human serotonin transporter cDNA as the probe. The same membrane blot was used for probing with 32P-labeled human β-actin cDNA as an internal control for RNA loading and transfer efficiency. This was done by stripping of the blot followed by rehybridization with the β-actin cDNA probe.RESULTSInfluence of Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and Staurosporine on Serotonin Uptake in JAR CellsThis investigation was initially started to determine whether the serotonin transporter expressed in JAR cells is regulated by protein kinase C as it has been shown for the serotonin transporter present in platelets (9Anderson G.M. Horne W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and in endothelial cells(8Myers C.L. Lazo J.S. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L253-L258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of JAR cells for 2 h with 1 μM PMA, an activator of protein kinase C, was found to cause a significant inhibition of the serotonin transporter activity, measured as the imipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake (Table 1). The inhibition was small (∼15%), but the effect was consistent in three different experiments. Treatment of the cells with staurosporine, a nonspecific but very potent inhibitor of protein kinases, for 2 h did not have any significant effect on the transporter activity. However, when treatment of the cells with PMA was done in the presence of staurosporine, PMA failed to inhibit the transporter. These experiments indicated that the serotonin transporter expressed in JAR cells is inhibited by protein kinase C, even though the effect is much smaller than found in platelets (40%; (9Anderson G.M. Horne W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1137: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) and in endothelial cells (30%, (8Myers C.L. Lazo J.S. Pitt B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L253-L258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We then investigated the long term regulation of the serotonin transporter in JAR cells by PMA. Treatment of the cells with 1 μM PMA for 16 h caused a significant increase in the transporter activity (Table 1). This stimulation could be either due to the PMA-induced down-regulation of protein kinase C (which could be expected to relieve the transporter from the inhibition caused by protein kinase C that may be constitutively active to a significant extent even in the absence of PMA) or due to protein kinase C-dependent cellular effects that are unique to the long term treatment with PMA. We studied the influence of staurosporine on the long term stimulatory effect of PMA (Table 1). These experiments led to a surprising and unexpected finding that treatment of the cells with 40 nM staurosporine alone for 16 h caused a 5-fold increase in the transporter activity. The magnitude of increase was not altered by PMA. The stimulatory effect of staurosporine does not appear to be due to the inhibition of protein kinase C. If this were to be the case, one would have expected staurosporine to have either no effect or an inhibitory effect on the transporter activity, based on the long term effect of PMA. Moreover, the stimulation of the transporter activity by staurosporine requires long term treatment because such an effect was not noticed when the cells were treated with staurosporine only for 2 h. This interesting observation prompted us to investigate in more detail the long term regulatory effect of staurosporine on the serotonin transporter.Stimulation of Serotonin Uptake by Staurosporine in JAR and BeWo CellsImipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake in JAR cells was measured after the cells were treated with 40 nM staurosporine for various time periods (1-16 h) at 37°C (Fig. 1A). There was no noticeable change in the uptake up to 4 h of treatment. With longer periods of treatment, there was marked stimulation of serotonin uptake, 30% at 6 h, 90% at 8 h, and 265% at 16 h. Dose-response studies carried out using a 16-h treatment time revealed that staurosporine is a very potent stimulator of serotonin uptake (Fig. 1B). A significant stimulation was noticeable at a staurosporine concentration as low as 2.5 nM. The magnitude of stimulation increased as the concentration of staurosporine increased. The uptake in cells treated with 40 nM staurosporine was 3.4-fold compared to the uptake in control cells. Similar results were obtained with BeWo cells, another human choriocarcinoma cell line (data not shown). Staurosporine at concentrations greater than 40 nM was found to affect cell viability to a significant extent.Specificity of Staurosporine EffectThis was assessed by measuring the uptake of taurine and alanine in control and staurosporine (40 nM, 16 h)-treated JAR cells and by comparing the results with serotonin uptake (Fig. 2). These experiments showed that under the conditions in which the uptake of serotonin was stimulated 3.6-fold by staurosporine, the uptake of taurine and the uptake of alanine remained unaffected.Figure 2:Specificity of staurosporine effect. Monolayer cultures were treated with or without staurosporine (40 nM) for 16 h at 37°C, following which the uptake of serotonin (the imipramine-sensitive component), taurine, and alanine was measured. Final concentration of serotonin, taurine, and alanine was 50, 30, and 5 nM, respectively, and the incubation period for uptake measurement was 3 min. Values are means ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Influence of Staurosporine on Kinetic Parameters of the Serotonin TransporterThe serotonin transporter activity in control and in staurosporine (40 nM, 16 h)-treated JAR cells was kinetically analyzed to determine the influence of staurosporine on the kinetic parameters, Michaelis-Menten constant (Kt) and maximal velocity (Vmax) of the transport system. The results, given in Fig. 3 as Eadie-Hofstee plots, show that the staurosporine-induced stimulation of serotonin uptake is accompanied by changes in Kt as well as in Vmax. Treatment of the cells with staurosporine (40 nM, 16 h) increased the Ktvalue from 0.31 ± 0.01 to 0.60 ± 0.03 μM. The Vmax was also markedly affected by staurosporine. The Vmax in control cells was 9.1 ± 0.2 pmol/3 min/mg of protein which increased to 66.6 ± 2.4 pmol/3 min/mg of protein in staurosporine-treated cells.Figure 3:Influence of staurosporine on the kinetic parameters of the serotonin transporter. Confluent cultures were treated with (•) or without (○) staurosporine (40 nM) for 16 h at 37°C. Imipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake was measured in these cells over a serotonin concentration range of 0.05-1 μM and with an incubation period of 3 min. Results (means ± S.E., n = 4) are given as Eadie-Hofstee plots (i.e.v/sversusv). v, serotonin uptake rate in pmol/mg of protein/3 min; s, serotonin concentration in μM.

Therefore, we assessed the influence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, on the staurosporine-induced stimulation of serotonin uptake in JAR cells (Table 2). For this purpose, the cells were treated with or without staurosporine (20 nM) in the absence or in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μM) or actinomycin D (0.02 μg/ml) for 16 h, following which the activity of the serotonin transporter was measured by determining the imipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D have been shown under these conditions to block the de novo synthesis of protein and RNA, respectively(5Ramamoorthy S. Cool D.R. Mahesh V.B. Leibach F.H. Melikian H.E. Blakely R.D. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21626-21631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brandsch M. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results of the experiments on serotonin uptake revealed that the stimulatory effect of staurosporine was completely abolished by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, strongly suggesting that transcriptional activation might underlie the observed stimulatory effect of staurosporine.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Effects of Protein Kinase Inhibitors on Serotonin Uptake in JAR CellsStaurosporine is one of the most potent inhibitors of protein kinases, but is rather non-selective. It inhibits protein kinase C as well as cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A and protein kinase G). In addition, tyrosine kinases and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases are also inhibited by staurosporine. We screened a variety of protein kinase inhibitors for their ability to stimulate serotonin uptake in JAR cells in order to find out whether inhibition of any of these protein kinases underlies the staurosporine-induced stimulation of serotonin uptake (Table 3). The results of the experiment showed that staurosporine is the only protein kinase inhibitor with the ability to enhance serotonin uptake. KT 5720, a selective inhibitor of PKA, showed a small but significant ability to stimulate the uptake. However, H-9, HA-1004, and K-252b which are expected to inhibit PKA at concentrations used in the experiment failed to show any effect. Similarly, chelerythrine which is a selective inhibitor of protein kinase C also had no effect on the uptake. H-89, an inhibitor of PKA and PKG, did not stimulate but instead markedly inhibited the uptake. Genistein and tyrphostin, inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, had no effect. CGS 9343B, a selective calmodulin antagonist, inhibited the uptake. The inability of any of these protein kinase inhibitors to simulate the staurosporine effect strongly suggests that the inhibition of protein kinases by staurosporine may not be related to the stimulation of serotonin uptake induced by staurosporine.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Serotonin Uptake in Plasma Membrane Vesicles Prepared from Control and Staurosporine-treated JAR CellsThe experiments with cycloheximide and actinomycin D indicated that the stimulatory effect of staurosporine might involve de novo synthesis of the serotonin transporter, thus increasing the transporter density in the plasma membrane. An additional supporting evidence for this mechanism would be to demonstrate the staurosporine-induced increase in serotonin uptake in plasma membrane vesicles isolated from these cells. For this purpose, we prepared plasma membrane vesicles from control and staurosporine (40 nM, 16 h)-treated JAR cells and measured in these vesicles imipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake in the presence of appropriate ionic gradients (inwardly directed Na+ and C1− gradients and outwardly directed K+ gradient). The results are given in Fig. 4. The value for imipramine-sensitive serotonin uptake at 0.2 μM concentration was 0.97 ± 0.06 pmol/15 s/mg of protein in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from control cells. The corresponding value in vesicles prepared from staurosporine-treated cells was 8.13 ± 0.15 pmol/15 s/mg of protein, a 7-fold increase compared to the control value. Thus, the stimulatory effect of staurosporine on serotonin uptake could be demonstrated at the plasma membrane level.Figure 4:Serotonin uptake in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from control and staurosporine-treated cells. Monolayer cultures were treated with or without staurosporine (40 nM) for 16 h at 37°C. Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from control and treated cells, and serotonin uptake was measured in these membrane vesicles in the presence of an inwardly directed NaCl gradient and an outwardly directed K+ gradient. Concentrations of serotonin during uptake measurement was 0.2 μM, membrane protein used for each assay was 100 μg, and the incubation period for uptake measurement was 15 s. Uptake was measured in the presence as well as in the absence of imipramine (0.1 mM). Values are means ± S.E.

Following A-site binding of the correct aminoacyl-tRNA, EF-Tu catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP, and EF-Tu•GDP is released from the ribosome. Elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts) catalyzes the nucleotide exchange reaction promoting the formation of EF-Tu•GTP from EF-Tu•GDP(2Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange reaction occurs through the formation of an intermediate EF-Tu•Ts complex(3Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 1016-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to E. coli, during the elongation cycle of protein synthesis in Thermus thermophilus, a dimeric form of EF-Ts binds two molecules of EF-Tu, forming an (EF-Tu•EF-Ts)2 structure, which is extremely stable and cannot be dissociated in the absence of protein-denaturing reagents(4Arai K.-I. Arai N. Nakamura S. Oshima T. Kaziro Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this organism, GDP present in the EF-Tu•GDP complex is thought to exchange directly with GTP present in the (EF-Tu•EF-Ts•GTP)2 dimer. Mammalian mitochondrial EF-Tu and EF-Ts (EF-Tumt and EF-Tsmt) have been purified as a tightly associated complex (EF-Tu•Tsmt) from bovine liver(5Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol.

The stability of the EF-Tu•EF-Ts complex is thought to be determined largely by the nature of the EF-Ts component. For example, EF-Ts from thermophilic bacteria forms strong complexes with E. coli EF-Tu, whereas E. coli EF-Ts produces only weak complexes with thermophilic EF-Tu(7Wittinghofer A. Guariguata R. Leberman R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1266-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, chloroplast EF-Ts from Euglena gracilis forms a tighter complex with E. coli and chloroplast EF-Tu than does the E. coli factor (8Spremulli G.H. Spremulli L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1490-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is not clear what features of EF-Ts modulate the strength of its interaction with EF-Tu. The genes for EF-Ts from several prokaryotes have been cloned and sequenced, as has the gene for chloroplast EF-Ts from the thermophilic red algae Galdieria sulphuraria. In general, the overall sequence for EF-Ts is far less conserved than the sequence for EF-Tu, but there is some conservation located in the NH2-terminal one-third of the protein. In this work, cDNAs encoding EF-Tsmt have been cloned and sequenced from both bovine and human liver. In addition, bovine liver EF-Tsmt has been expressed in E. coli. EF-Tu•Tsmt was purified as described(5Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EF-Tumt and EF-Tsmt components were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Brownlee RP300 column (2.1 × 100 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (20-64%) over 60 min. The fraction identified as EF-Tsmt was dried, dissolved in 8 M urea, and incubated at 50°C for 30 min. The solution was diluted to 4 M urea with 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Sequence-grade endoproteinase Lys-C was added (5 μg), and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 20 h. The resultant peptides were separated on a Brownlee RP300 column (1.0 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (8-64%) over 90 min. The prominent peaks were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A liquid-pulse sequencer connected to an Applied Biosystems 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Total RNA was extracted from bovine liver by the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure(9Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography(10Jacobson A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription of 5 μg of mRNA using primer 3 or 4 (see Table 1) or primer NS (GGAATTCCCTGCCTGTTTGAGATCCCCGC; the underlined sequence represents an EcoRI adaptor). Bovine liver chromosomal DNA was prepared as described(11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab PCR amplification reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 50 pmol of the appropriate primers, the buffer system purchased with Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and either 1 μg of bovine liver chromosomal DNA or an aliquot of the specifically primed cDNA. When the cDNA was used as template, the first five cycles were done at 94°C for 1 min (denaturation), 56°C for 1.5 min (annealing), and 72°C for 2 min (polymerization). For the remaining 35 cycles, annealing was carried out at 61°C. When chromosomal DNA was used as template, primer annealing was done at 50°C during the first five cycles and at 55°C in the 35 remaining cycles. In the last cycle, the reaction time at 72°C was extended to 5 min to allow completion of chains. Nested PCRs involving a second or third round of amplification were carried out as described above, except that they contained 1 μl of the reaction mixture obtained from the previous round of PCR as the template. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on 1.5% agarose or 3% NuSieve GTG-agarose gels. Specific bands were identified by ethidium bromide staining and eluted from the gel using a Geneclean or Mermaid kit (BIO 101, Inc.). Approximately 5 × 106 plaques from two bovine liver libraries (Stratagene) and 2 × 106 plaques from a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) were screened by hybridization with a bovine liver EF-Tsmt cDNA probe obtained by PCR amplification and labeled using random priming (12Gottesman M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 151: 363-364Google Scholar). Hybridizations with bovine liver libraries were carried out at 65°C, while hybridization with the human library was done at 55°C. Positive plaques were replated until purified, and the pBluescript SK(-) phagemid clones were excised according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized as described above using the reverse primer NS. A poly(dA) tail was added to this cDNA by terminal transferase. This cDNA was used as template for 5′-RACE-PCR (13Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). A specific PCR product, ∼260 bp, was obtained, and two BamHI fragments from it were cloned into pTZ18R. EF-Tsmt clones were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (14Biggin M.D. Gibson T.J. Hong G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3963-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar) and subjected to autosequencing in the University of North Carolina DNA Sequencing Facility. All clones were sequenced completely in both directions. Analysis of the sequence was done with Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis programs running on a VAX computer. Single-stranded 5′-RACE products were sequenced after two rounds of nested PCR. The single-stranded DNA was generated in the second round of PCR by using one primer in a 50-fold molar excess over the other primer. Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA was performed using 1% agarose gels run in the presence of 1 M glyoxal and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide as described(15Carmichael G.G. McMaster G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Bovine chromosomal DNA (30 μg) was digested with an optimal amount of the indicated restriction enzyme. Digests were run on 1.5% agarose gels at 60 V for 19 h. Nucleic acids were transferred to Zeta-Probe blotting membranes as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad), and blots were probed as indicated. PCR was used to add an NdeI cutting site to the 5′-end and an XhoI cutting site to the 3′-end of the bovine liver cDNA encoding the precursor form of EF-Tsmt and to the portion of the cDNA encoding the mature form of EF-Tsmt. These cDNAs were then cloned into pET24c(+). E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host for expression. Purification of the mature and precursor forms under denaturing conditions was performed using nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography as described by QIAGEN Inc. For the large-scale purification of the mature and precursor forms under native conditions, expression was induced by exposure of cells (1.0-1.2 A600 units/ml) to 0.025 mM IPTG. Cells were collected after 1 h of induction and lysed by grinding with two times the cell weight of alumina for 20 min on ice. The cell paste was resuspended in 4 volumes of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 60 mM KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 7 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Alumina was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with DNase I (5 μg/ml) for 15 min on ice. The extract was then subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Ni-NTA resin (0.4 ml of a 50% slurry) equilibrated in the same buffer was added to the extract for each 1 liter of original culture. This slurry was shaken at 4°C for 1 h. The Ni-NTA resin was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, rinsed with 35 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 M NH4Cl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol), poured into a small column, and washed with an additional 60 ml of wash buffer. Protein was eluted from the resin using three aliquots (1 ml each) of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 M imidazole, and 10% glycerol). The eluted protein was dialyzed immediately against a 100-fold excess of buffer containing 20 mM Hepes/KOH, pH 7.0, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The protein concentrations were determined by the Micro-Bradford method (Bio-Rad). The activity of the complex containing E. coli EF-Tu and EF-Tsmt (E. coli EF-Tu•EF-Tsmt) was measured by its ability to catalyze the poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine on E. coli ribosomes(5Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16324-16330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit is defined as the incorporation of 1 pmol of [14C]Phe into polypeptide at 37°C using a 30-min incubation. Polyclonal antibodies against EF-Tu•EF-Tsmt were produced by Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AK).2 2V. Woriax and L. Spremulli, manuscript in preparation. Western blotting was done by using the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system of Amersham Corp. EF-Tsmt is the product of a nuclear gene in mammals. To obtain cDNA clones of this factor, it was necessary to obtain partial peptide sequence information. The EF-Tu•Tsmt complex was dissociated, and the two factors were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. EF-Tsmt was subjected to NH2-terminal Edman degradation and to internal peptide sequence analysis following digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C. The sequences of six peptides ranging in size from 9 to 26 residues including the NH2-terminal peptide were obtained (Table 1). Several of the peptides have only a low sequence identity to the sequences for the corresponding prokaryotic factors, and except for the NH2-terminal peptide, their relative positions could not be predicted. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed from these sequences. Forward primers Np-1 and 1 were derived from the NH2-terminal peptide, and their relative positions with respect to each other were known exactly (Fig. 1). Reverse primers 3 and 4 were predicted to be located either in the middle or the COOH-terminal region of EF-Tsmt. The positions of primers 3 and 4 relative to each other could not be predicted. Hence, two groups of nested reverse transcriptase-PCRs were carried out (Fig. 1). Two specific cDNAs were synthesized, one using primer 3 (cDNA3) and the other using primer 4 (cDNA4). In the first round of PCR, the primer used for cDNA synthesis was used in combination with primer Np-1 derived from the NH2-terminal sequence. No specific bands were visible after the first round of PCR in either group. A second round of PCR was performed using the product of cDNA3 and primers Np-1 and 4. No specific bands could be observed after this second round of PCR, suggesting that primer 3 lies to the 5′-side of primer 4. In contrast, a very strong band of ∼650 bp could be observed after the second round of PCR using the product of the first round of PCR derived from cDNA4 with primers 3 and Np-1 (Fig. 1). This observation confirms the idea that primer 3 lies to the 5′-side of primer 4, allowing the nested PCR to succeed. To further confirm the identity of the 650-bp product, this fragment was amplified using primers 3 and primer 1. This reaction gave a product of ∼600 bp, ∼60 bp shorter than the starting DNA. This size difference corresponds to the distance between primers Np-1 and 1. The 650-bp product was cloned into vector pTZ18R and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of this fragment contained five of the peptides obtained by sequence analysis, confirming that this fragment is indeed a partial cDNA coding for bovine liver EF-Tsmt. Bovine liver λZap II and λMAX-1 cDNA libraries were screened for additional portions of the EF-Tsmt cDNA. Three positive plaques were isolated from the λZap II cDNA library, and the pBluescript plasmids carrying the cDNA inserts of interest were excised in vivo. DNA sequence analysis indicated that these clones encompassed the entire 3′-region of the EF-Tsmt cDNA, including the poly(A) tail. Five clones were isolated in a similar manner from the λMAX-1 cDNA library. They contained inserts of ∼135 bp from the middle of the EF-Tsmt coding sequence. None of eight clones isolated contained the 5′-region of the bovine liver EF-Tsmt cDNA, and all of the inserts had the same 5′-end. Subsequent analysis of the sequence of the EF-Tsmt cDNA indicated that there is a G:C-rich region just upstream of this position. Presumably, secondary structure in the mRNA resulted in a strong stop for reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis. To obtain the sequences from the 5′-end of the EF-Tsmt cDNA, 5′-RACE-PCR was carried out(13Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). This approach allowed the cloning of an additional 176 bp from the 5′-end of the EF-Tsmt cDNA. Analysis of the cDNA clones described above provided 1297 bp of sequence including the poly(A) tail and encompassing the entire coding region (Fig. 2). The size of the cDNA obtained corresponds well to the size estimated for the mRNA by Northern analysis (data not shown). The long open reading frame codes for the entire EF-Tsmt polypeptide, including a 55-amino acid mitochondrial localization signal and a mature protein of 283 amino acids. The cDNA sequence indicates that bovine liver EF-Tsmt has a very short 5′-untranslated region (18 bp long). Although few eukaryotic cytoplasmic mRNAs have leader regions as short as 18 nucleotides, work by Kozak (16Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kozak M. Gene Expr. 1991; 1: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar) indicates that a leader of this length is generally sufficient to allow initiation. It is possible that all of the clones obtained by 5′-RACE-PCR are shorter than the actual mRNA, reflecting a strong barrier to reverse transcriptase at this position. However, 27 clones obtained by 5′-RACE-PCR all terminated within this region. The initiation codon (designated position +1) is preceded by an A residue at position −3 and followed by a T residue at position +4. Analysis of numerous translational start sites indicates that the consensus sequence has a purine at position −3 and a G residue at position +4(19Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region is 190 bp in length and contains a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) 16 nucleotides before the poly(A) tail. An analysis of the encoded amino acid sequence is provided below. The bovine liver cDNA was used as a probe to screen a human liver λZap II library. Two of the 10 positive clones obtained had inserts of ∼1 kilobases, including a poly(A) tail. These two clones included the entire coding region for the mature form of bovine liver EF-Tsmt and a portion of the mitochondrial import signal (Fig. 2). NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicates that the mature form of bovine liver EF-Tsmt begins with Ser-56 in the long open reading frame (Fig. 2). The mitochondrial import signal for EF-Tsmt is thus 55 residues long. Mitochondrial import sequences are not highly conserved in primary sequence. However, they generally lack acidic residues, are enriched in basic and hydroxylated amino acids, and can form an amphiphilic α-helix or β-sheet. The transit peptide for bovine EF-Tsmt lacks acidic residues, but is not particularly enriched in either basic or hydroxylated residues. It does not appear to be able to form an amphiphilic α-helix or β-sheet. At least two different pathways are believed to be involved in the processing of proteins imported into mitochondria(20Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). One pathway uses a single mitochondrial processing peptidase that recognizes Arg at position −2 relative to the processing site(20Hendrick J.P. Hodges P.E. Rosenberg L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The precursor for bovine liver EF-Tsmt does not appear to fit into this group. A second pathway involves sequential cleavage by two proteases. Proteins processed by this pathway generally have Arg at position −10, a hydrophobic residue at position −8, and Gly, Ser, or Thr at position −5 relative to the cut site. The precursor for bovine liver EF-Tsmt has His at position −10, Phe at position −8, and Gly at position −5 and may possibly be processed by this two-step pathway. The mature form of bovine EF-Tsmt is 283 amino acids in length (Fig. 2) and has a molecular mass of 30,739 Da. The mature form of human liver EF-Tsmt also appears to have 283 residues. The two mammalian EF-Tsmt sequences are 91% identical (Table 2). The sequence of EF-Ts from three prokaryotes (E. coli, Spiroplasma citri, and Spirulina platensis), one chloroplast EF-Ts sequence (G. sulphuraria), and several eukaryotic EF-1βγδ sequences have been reported(21An G. Bendiak D.S. Mamelak L.A. Friesen J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 4163-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Chevalier C. Saillard C. Bove J.M. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The β- and δ-subunits of the cytoplasmic factor have both been reported to function as nucleotide exchange factors(24Cormier P. Osborne H.B. Morales J. Bassez T. Minella O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Mulner-Lorillon O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 743Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Morales J. Cormier P. Mulner-Lorillon O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The bacterial factors are ∼250-300 residues in length, similar to the size of the mammalian mitochondrial factors. The one known gene for chloroplast EF-Ts encodes a protein of 199 residues, although it is unclear whether this gene actually encodes a functional product(23Sanangelantoni A.M. Calogero R.C. Buttarelli F.R. Gualerzi C.O. Tiboni O. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 66: 141-146Crossref Google Scholar). The only chloroplast EF-Ts studied at the protein level to date is from E. gracilis(26Fox L. Erion J. Tarnowski J. Spremulli L. Brot N. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6018-6019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to be a monomer of 62 kDa, considerably larger that any of the corresponding factors known. The β- and δ-subunits of the cytoplasmic factor EF-1 are 227 and 265 residues in length, respectively(24Cormier P. Osborne H.B. Morales J. Bassez T. Minella O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Mulner-Lorillon O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 743Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 25Morales J. Cormier P. Mulner-Lorillon O. Poulhe R. Belle R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences of these nucleotide exchange factors (Table 2) indicates that mammalian EF-Tsmt is 27-35% identical to the corresponding prokaryotic and chloroplast factors, but <21% identical to either the β- or δ-subunit of EF-1.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The alignment of the sequences of EF-Ts from prokaryotes, chloroplasts, and mammalian mitochondria (Fig. 3) indicates that conserved regions are clustered in the NH2-terminal one-third of the protein. The complete conservation of 22 residues in these factors is observed, with 20 of these amino acids being located within the first 90 residues. The longest stretch of completely conserved residues is 5 amino acids long. There is also a conserved stretch of 10 residues present if conservative substitutions are taken into account. Little information is available on the regions of EF-Ts that are important for the nucleotide exchange activity of this factor. The sequence alignment presented in Fig. 3 and the observation that EF-Tsmt will promote GDP exchange with E. coli EF-Tu suggest that the NH2-terminal one-third of the protein may play a particularly important role in this process. For determination of the number of copies of the gene encoding bovine liver EF-Tsmt, a Southern blot of total DNA digested with EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and BglII, respectively, was probed using nucleotides 177-1182 as a probe (Fig. 4). This region was selected as a probe because PCR analysis of genomic DNA and the cDNA indicated that no introns were present in this region of the gene (data not shown). EcoRI cuts the probe once, while the other three enzymes do not have a cutting site in the probe. As indicated in Fig. 4, EcoRI digestion resulted in the appearance of four bands, while BamHI, HindIII, and BglII digestion gave two bands on the Southern blot. These results suggest that two genes encoding EF-Tsmt exist in bovine chromosomal DNA. PCR analysis failed to amplify genomic sequences corresponding to the cDNA, suggesting that neither of the genes detected is a pseudogene (data not shown). It has recently been observed that there are also two copies of the EF-Tumt gene in bovine chromosomal DNA.3 3V. Woriax, W. Burkhart, and L. Spremulli, manuscript in preparation. An examination of the EF-Tsmt gene for the presence of intervening sequences was carried out by PCR amplification of chromosomal DNA using different combinations of oligonucleotide primers designed from the cDNA sequence. This analysis indicated the presence of an intron near the 5′-end of the bovine EF-Tsmt genes. The PCR analysis used here suggests that both genes contain a similarly sized intron. However, this procedure can only detect relatively small introns, and this interpretation must be viewed with caution. This intron (224 bp) was cloned and sequenced (Fig. 2B). There are no reports on the expression of EF-Tsmt in any mammalian species to date. To investigate the relative amounts of the EF-Tsmt transcript in different human tissues, a multiple tissue Northern blot was analyzed using the full-length cDNA of EF-Tsmt as a probe. As shown in Fig. 5, EF-Tsmt transcripts of ∼1200 bases could be observed in all the human tissues analyzed. Human skeletal muscle had the most abundant level of transcripts among the tissues tested, followed by liver, kidney, and heart. Placenta, brain, pancreas, and lung had substantially lower levels of the mRNA for EF-Tsmt. Higher levels of expression were clearly observed in specialized tissues known to have high demands for energy production. Skeletal muscle contains not only the normal 1200-base mRNA, but also a larger transcript. Lower amounts of this other transcript are observed in several other tissues. This transcript may possibly arise from use of an alternative polyadenylation site (27Wahle E. Keller W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 419-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or from transcription of the two separate genes or may represent a cross-hybridizing mRNA. Both the precursor of bovine liver EF-Tsmt (pre-EF-Tsmt) and the mature form of this factor (amino acids 56-338) were cloned into a pET expression vector. Both constructs carry a 6-residue histidine tag at the COOH terminus separated from the normal COOH terminus by a Leu-Glu linker. As indicated in Fig. 6(lane1), little, if any, material corresponding to EF-Tsmt was detectable in extracts of uninduced cells. However, following IPTG induction, a major band with a molecular mass of 34 kDa was observed (Fig. 6, lane2). Western analysis of samples before and after induction (lanes6 and 7) indicated that the new band reacted strongly with antibodies raised against bovine EF-Tu•Tsmt. This observation demonstrates that the cells are indeed expressing the bovine mitochondrial factor. The expressed EF-Tsmt migrated on SDS-PAGE to a position ∼2 kDa larger than that observed with EF-Tu•Tsmt prepared from mitochondria (Fig. 6, lanes2 and 3). This observation is not surprising since there are 9 extra amino acid residues including the His tag in the expressed form of the factor. An examination of the effects of induction of EF-Tsmt on the growth of the host E. coli cells indicated that the cells stopped growing within 1 h after induction, suggesting that the expression of the bovine mitochondrial factor is toxic to the cells. Maximal levels of induction were observed between 1 and 2 h following addition of IPTG, and concentrations of IPTG as low as 25 μM gave maximal levels of expression. The His-tagged form of pre-EF-Tsmt was expressed in E. coli as a 42-kDa protein. Pre-EF-Tsmt could be observed primarily in extracts made under denaturing conditions and when induction was carried out for only ∼30 min. Longer periods of induction resulted in the degradation of pre-EF-Tsmt (data not shown). When the mature form of EF-Tsmt was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography under nondenaturing conditions and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, lane4), a band with a molecular mass of 44 kDa copurified with EF-Tsmt. This band appears to have a molecular mass identical to that of E. coli EF-Tu (lane5), indicating that the mitochondrial factor will form a complex with bacterial EF-Tu. This observation is not surprising since EF-Tsmt can promote guanine nucleotide exchange with prokaryotic EF-Tu(5Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the E. coli EF-Tu•EF-Tsmt complex to function in the poly(U)-directed polymerization of phenylalanine was examined. As shown in Fig. 7, this complex was active in the in vitro assay. The specific activity obtained for the heterologous complex (140,000 units/mg) is ∼30% of the activity that is obtained with the homologous EF-Tu•Tsmt complex from bovine liver. The E. coli EF-Tu•EF-Tsmt complex functions catalytically in the polymerization assay, with ∼10 rounds of phenylalanine incorporated into peptide for each complex present. A more detailed analysis of the properties of this heterologous complex is now underway."

https://openalex.org/W1986768890,"Signal peptidase removes amino-terminal signal peptides from precursor proteins during or immediately following their translocation to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and may participate in ER degradation, a poorly defined process whereby abnormal proteins are rapidly degraded early in the secretory pathway. Here, the involvement of signal peptidase in ER degradation is examined through the use of two chimeric membrane proteins that lack amino-terminal signal peptides: A189invHD, which contains sequences derived from arginine permease and histidinol dehydrogenase, and AHDK2, containing the ER-resident protein Kar2p fused to the carboxyl terminus of A189invHD. Degradation of approximately 95% of A189invHD is observed in yeast cells expressing enzymatically active signal peptidase, whereas only 60% undergoes rapid degradation in a sec11 mutant bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding the 18-kDa subunit (Sec11p) of the signal peptidase complex. AHDK2 is proteolyzed in a reaction yielding at least two fragments in wild-type cells and in the sec11 mutant containing a plasmid bearing the SEC11 gene.

Using conditional mutants defective in protein translocation into and out of the ER and in vitro protease protection studies, the site of degradation for AHDK2 is localized to the ER lumen.

In vivo studies in yeast show that ablation of the maturation process as a result of a temperature-sensitive mutation affecting signal peptidase activity (sec11) leads to a deficit in protein trafficking to the cell surface and lethality at the nonpermissive temperature(4Bohni P.C.

Yeast Sec11p is homologous to the 18- and 21-kDa subunits of the mammalian SPC(16Greenburg G. Shelness G.S. Blobel G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the significance of two Sec11p homologues in mammals is not understood. Recent studies suggest that signal peptidase may have a role not only in the processing of amino-terminal signal peptides but also in the rapid degradation of some abnormal proteins within the ER through a process generally referred to as ER degradation(19Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 37Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). When uncomplexed with the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, H2 is degraded resulting in the accumulation of a 35-kDa proteolytic intermediate(1Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 37Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing of the cleavage site of this intermediate and surrounding residues reveals a primary sequence organization similar to that of amino-terminal signal peptides(37Yuk M.H. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A dependence on small neutral or small polar residues for efficient cleavage of H2, identical to that seen for the processing of signal peptides, is observed following substitutions with large or charged amino acids at the cleavage site. Though these substitutions prevent the production of the 35-kDa fragment, they do not prevent proteolytic elimination of H2. These findings demonstrate H2 is degraded by at least two pathways, one of which may involve signal peptidase. In addition, in vitro studies have shown that a precursor protein derived from the Semliki Forest virus(20Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mutant forms of the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor(26Schmid S.R. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16886-16891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the invarient chain of the major histocompatibility antigen (21Lipp J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1103-1112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are cleaved near their transmembrane segments at sequences bearing similarities to signal peptide cleavage sites. Due to the absence of specific pharmacological inhibitors, the involvement of signal peptidase in ER degradation has not been conclusively demonstrated. In the present study, we have employed a genetic approach to more directly examine the role of signal peptidase. Using the sec11 mutant, we demonstrate that A189invHD, a chimeric membrane protein containing the cytoplasmic enzyme histidinol dehydrogenase fused to a luminal domain of arginine permease, is degraded in a manner dependent on functional signal peptidase. Degradation of AHDK2, a derivative of A189invHD containing Kar2p (an ER resident protein) fused at its carboxyl terminus, is blocked in the sec11 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas partial degradation is observed at more permissive temperatures. Complementation of the sec11 mutation through the introduction of a plasmid encoding wild-type Sec11p into the sec11 mutant results in the cleavage of AHDK2 at, minimally, two internal sites. Cleavage of AHDK2 and the production of distinct intermediates are also observed in wild-type (SEC11) cells. Furthermore, through both genetic and biochemical analyses we identify the ER lumen as the site of proteolytic processing of AHDK2. The data presented thus provide strong evidence that signal peptidase can cleave internal sites within polypeptide chains and participates in an intra-ER degradative pathway. YPD (rich), SC-CAS (supplemented), and SC (minimal) media have been described previously (15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SC-CAS medium contains leucine and histidine as part of a casamino acids supplement but is deficient in uracil, adenine, and tryptophan. Nucleotides and amino acids were added when appropriate to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml each. When selecting for plasmids containing URA3, SC-CAS supplemented with tryptophan was used. SC medium, with appropritate supplements for auxotrophs, was used for growth of cells containing plasmids bearing LEU2. The yeast strains used in this work are as follows: FC2-12B, MATα trp1-1 ura3-52 his4-401 leu2-1 HOL1-1 CAN1-1(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); CSa42, MATasec61-3 trp1-1 ura3-52 his4-401 HOL1-1(13Green N. Fang H. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); RSY427, MATα sec23-1 ura3-52 leu2-1 trp1-1 his4-619 (from Jon Rothblatt, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH); PBY408A, MATα sec11-7 ura3-52 his4-519 leu2-3,112 gal2-1(4); and CMY10, MATα sec23-1 sec11-7 trp1-1 ura3-52 his4 leu2 (constructed in this study from strains PBY408A and RSY427). Anti-Kar2p was from Mark Rose (Princeton University); anti-carboxypeptidase Y was from Randy Schekman (University of California, Berkeley); and anti-invertase was from Johnny Ngsee (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Anti-HD antibodies were described previously(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Construction of pA189invHD (2 μ URA3) has been described(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pAHDK2 (2 μ URA3) was made as follows. The PvuII restriction fragment was removed from plasmid pA189invHD, and a NotI linker (GCGGCCGC) was inserted into this PvuII site. A fragment of the KAR2 gene encoding yeast BiP (22Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25Rose M. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) was amplified from pMR713 (CEN4 LEU2) (from Dr. Mark Rose) by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers (AAGCGGCCGCCCTTTACAGAATTCTTTCCA and TTGCGGCCGCAATTGTATGAAGCTCGAAGT), corresponding to sequences near KAR2 (nucleotides 81-100, where nucleotide 1 is the beginning of the protein coding sequence, and nucleotides 2156-2175, which extend beyond the protein coding sequence). Each primer contains a NotI restriction site. The amplified DNA fragment was restricted with NotI and inserted into pA189invHD containing the above-mentioned NotI linker. The orientation of the inserted fragment was determined by restriction analysis, revealing pAHDK2, which encodes an in-frame fusion between HD and Kar2p (see Fig. 1). The sequence of the HD-Kar2 fusion joint is SIDMPGGRPLQNSF, where DMP is the end of the HD fragment and PLQ is the beginning of the Kar2 fragment. For the construction of pCM111 (CEN6 LEU2), a 1.3-kilobase SacI-BamHI restriction fragment (containing the wild-type SEC11 gene with its endogenous promoter) was isolated from plasmid pRSB224 (2 μ URA3) (a gift of Dr. Randy Schekman). This fragment was subsequently inserted into the polylinker region of pRS315 (CEN6 LEU2)(28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive strains (PBY408A, CSa42, RSY427, and CMY10) were grown at the permissive temperature (23°C) to A600 = 1 (log phase) in appropriate media for selection of plasmids (above) and then shifted to SC medium, with appropriate supplements but lacking methionine and cysteine, for 1 h at 23°C and then to 28°C for 1 h, 30°C for 5 min, 30°C for 1 h, 32°C for 1 h, or 37°C for 1 h before the addition of label. Nonconditional strain FC2-12B bearing one of the above-mentioned plasmids containing URA3 was grown at 30°C to A600 = 1 in SC-CAS medium, supplemented appropriately, and then shifted to methionine- and cysteine-depleted medium (above) for 1 h before the addition of label. Cells were subjected to a 5-min pulse with 16 μCi/ml of a protein labeling mix containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (EXPRE35S35S, DuPont NEN) and in some experiments to a chase with excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine (added to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml methionine and 200 μg/ml cysteine). Cells were removed at the time intervals indicated in the text. In all experiments, an equal amount of cells was removed at each interval (1 A600 equivalent of cells). Preparations of extracts derived from radiolabeled cells were prepared essentially as described previously(10Fang H. Green N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were sedimented in a microcentrifuge and then resuspended in 0.2 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Glass beads were added to the Eppendorf tube in an amount that produced approximately equal volumes of liquid and glass beads. The cells were lysed by a 30-s pulse of vortex mixing followed by 30 s of incubation on ice, repeated 3 times. The mixture of proteins and broken cells was sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm, and the pellet was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 μl) and boiled for 5 min. The boiled proteins were resuspended in a solution (0.7 ml) containing phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 (1%) and protease inhibitors. Cell debris was sedimented in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 rpm. Immunoprecipitation was then performed through the addition of appropriate antiserum, anti-Kar2p (0.5 μl/1 A600 cells), or anti-HD (3 μl/1 A600 cells) to the supernatant followed by an overnight incubation on ice. The following day a mixture containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, protein A-insoluble lyophilized cell powder was prepared by the instructions provided by the supplier (Sigma). A fraction of the mixture (10 μl) was added to each Eppendorf tube, and the tubes were subsequently placed on a rotating platform for 45 min. The cell powder containing bound antibodies was sedimented for 30 s in a microcentrifuge (12,000 rpm), and the pellet was subjected to two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100 followed by two washes with distilled water. The pellet was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 μl) for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, washed in water, and then incubated in a solution containing sodium salicylate (1 M) for 30 min. The gel was then dried and placed on x-ray film for analysis by fluorography. For Western blotting, the TCA-precipitated proteins prepared from cells broken with glass beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and detected with either anti-Kar2p (1:5000) or anti-invertase (1:500) antibodies using alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies (from Bio-Rad). Autoradiograms depicting bands from pulse-chase analyses were analyzed on a model DU 70 spectrophotometer (480 nm wavelength) using a gel scanner adaptor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). A plot of optical density versus position along the the autoradiogram was obtained. The areas under the peaks corresponding to bands on the autoradiogram were measured by programming provided by the manufacturer. Protein levels were recorded as percent remaining in the chase relative to that present after the pulse. For cellular fractionation studies, cells of wild-type strain FC2-12B(SEC11)/pAHDK2 (3 mls) were grown to A600 = 1 (log phase) in appropriate media for selection of plasmid. Cellular extract from 1 OD equivalent (1 ml) was prepared as described above and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (10 μl). Remaining 2 OD equivalents (2 mls) were pelleted and resuspended in 400 ml of fractionation buffer containing protease inhibitors(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cells were then lysed using glass beads. This suspension was then subjected to a low speed spin (10,000 × g for 5 min) at 4°C. The supernatant (∼400 μl) was removed and subjected to a high speed spin (45,000 × g for 45 min) at 4°C. Resulting high speed supernatant (representing soluble fraction) was removed and added to 400 μl of ice cold 20% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were precipitated as above and resuspended in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The high speed pellet (representing membrane fraction) was directly dissolved in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Whole cell protein extract, soluble fraction, and membrane fraction were boiled and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-Kar2p antibodies (25Rose M. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) (1:5000 dilution). For proteinase K protection analysis, cells of wild-type strain FC2-12B (SEC11)/pAHDK2 (12 mls) were grown to A600 = 1 (log phase) in appropriate media for selection of plasmid. Spheroplasts preparation and lysis were then performed at 4°C as described previously(8Dunn B. Wobbe C.R. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.13.1-13.13.9Google Scholar). Spheroplast homogenate was subjected to a low speed spin (650 × g for 4 min) at 4°C to pellet unbroken cells. Resulting supernatant was then split into two equal volumes (approximately 6 OD equivalents/tube). One tube was adjusted to 0.4% Triton X-100 with the second designated detergent free. A volume representing 1 OD equivalent was immediately removed from each tube and quenched in a 14 × volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Proteinase K (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was then added to remaining 5 OD equivalents in each tube to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. A volume representing 1 OD equivalent was immediately removed from each tube and quenched as above. Sample collection of these and following fractions required approximately 15 s. At subsequent time points indicated in the text, volumes representing 1 OD equivalent were removed from each tube and quenched in trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were precipitated by centrifugation (12,000 rpm/5 min) in a tabletop microcentrifuge. Protein pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Boiled samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Kar2p antibodies (1:5000 dilution). We previously constructed a series of gene fusions for the purpose of identifying topologically distinct domains of arginine permease, a multispanning membrane protein of the yeast S. cerevisiae(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analyses revealed that some of the chimeras were rapidly degraded in vivo. One such chimera, A189invHD, was comprised of 189 amino-terminal residues of arginine permease (including a type II transmembrane segment), a spacer sequence derived from invertase, and the cytoplasmic enzyme histidinol dehydrogenase (HD) (Fig. 1). Topology studies indicated that ∼100 residues of the amino terminus of A189invHD were placed on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane followed by a signal/anchor sequence (transmembrane segment) and then by the carboxyl-terminal invertase-histidinol dehydrogenase sequence(14Green N. Hansen W. Walter P. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1989; 11: 109-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Integration of A189invHD into the ER membrane resulted in the translocation of the invertase-histidinol dehydrogenase moiety to the lumen, where glycosylation at one or more of the 11 glycosylation sites in the invertase-histidinol dehydrogenase sequence occurred(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As hybrid proteins have been instrumental in the study of protein degradation within the ER (5Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 247: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Stoller T.J. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and other compartments(34Wagner I. Arlt H. Dyck L.V. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we reasoned this chimera may be useful for studying the role of signal peptidase in ER degradation. For this purpose, we employed yeast strains containing one or both of two temperature-sensitive mutations: sec11, which inhibits signal peptidase activity(4Bohni P.C. Deshaies R.J. Schekman R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and sec23, which inhibits the budding of transport vesicles off the ER membrane (resulting in retention of proteins in the ER)(18Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 23Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Strain RSY427 (sec23) (complete genotypes of strains used in this study are described under “Experimental Procedures”) containing expression plasmid pA189invHD (15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was grown at 23°C to log phase and then preincubated for 1 h at 32°C, a nonpermissive temperature for strains containing sec23 and/or sec11 mutations (Fig. 2). Cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with a mixture of radiolabeled methionine and cysteine and then subjected to a chase for 90 min in the presence of excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine (see “Experimental Procedures”). Proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with anti-HD antibodies following the pulse and at specific intervals during the chase. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 3A, A189invHD was detected after the pulse in strain RSY427 (SEC11 sec23) (lane1) and then rapidly degraded during the 30- (lane2), 60- (lane3), and 90-min (lane4) chase periods. The fact that A189invHD was degraded in the sec23 mutant, similar to that seen in wild-type cells(15Green N. Walter P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), demonstrated that A189invHD was degraded prior to its insertion into transport vesicles that bud off the ER membrane. To determine the effect of the sec11 mutation on A189invHD degradation, strain CMY10 (sec11 sec23)/pA189invHD was examined by pulse-chase at 32°C. This analysis revealed that A189invHD was only partially degraded during a 90-min chase period in the sec11 sec23 double mutant (lanes5-8).Figure 3:Degradation of chimera A189invHD. A, strains RSY427 (SEC11 sec23) (lanes1-4) and CMY10 (sec11 sec23) (lanes5-8), each bearing pA189invHD, were subjected to a pulse-chase analysis following a 1-h preincubation at a nonpermissive temperature for both strains (32°C). Labeled proteins were precipitated with anti-HD antibodies after the 5-min pulse (P) and at the indicated time points during the chase (C) period. The position of A189invHD is indicated. B, quantitation of the degradation of A189invHD in RSY427 (SEC11 sec23) (opensquares) and CMY10 (sec11 sec23) (closedsquares) was performed through scanning laser densitometry on three independent analyses performed identically to that depicted in A. Average values are plotted as percent of A189invHD remaining relative to that in the pulse (100%) over time (in minutes) of the chase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantitation of A189invHD degradation kinetics revealed that >95% of A189invHD was degraded during the first 30 min of the chase in strain RSY427 (SEC11 sec23), while only ∼60% of A189invHD was rapidly degraded in strain CMY10 (sec11 sec23) (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that the degradation of approximately 40% of A189invHD required expression of functional signal peptidase (specifically Sec11p), while a significant fraction (60%) was proteolyzed through a signal peptidase-independent process. Thus, despite the absence of proteolytic intermediates, these data clearly implicated signal peptidase (an endoprotease) in the degradation of A189invHD. To further investigate the role of signal peptidase, we constructed a second gene fusion termed AHDK2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). AHDK2 differs from its progenitor, A189invHD, in its carboxyl terminus at which 207 carboxyl-terminal residues of HD were replaced with residues 28-682 of the ER-resident protein Kar2p (Fig. 1). Residues 28-682 represent all of the sequences of full-length Kar2p lacking the positively charged region and the hydrophobic core sequence of its amino-terminal signal peptide(22Normington K. Kohno K. Kozutsumi Y. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1223-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The Kar2p sequence was utilized for the following reasons. First, Kar2p, a resident luminal protein presumably not targeted for ER degradation, may stabilize all or part of the sequences to which it is attached, thereby leading to proteolytic intermediates. Second, antibodies directed against Kar2p can be used in conjunction with anti-HD antibodies to determine the fate of different sequences within the polypeptide chain. Third, endogenous Kar2p provides an internal control for all analyses performed with anti-Kar2p antibodies. Strain PBY408A (sec11) containing the plasmid bearing this new construct (pAHDK2) was grown to log phase at 23°C, followed by a preincubation of 1 h at a nonpermissive temperature (37°C). Cells were then subjected to a pulse-chase analysis as described above, except that proteins were precipitated from cell extracts with anti-Kar2p antibodies. The temperature-induced defect in signal peptidase activity in the sec11 mutant was readily apparent by the presence of preKar2p throughout the pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 4, lanes5-8). At this nonpermissive temperature, the chimera was stable during the 5-min pulse (lane5) and the 90 min chase (lanes6-8). A plasmid containing the wild-type SEC11 gene (pCM111) was introduced into strain PBY408A (sec11)/pAHDK2 to further assess the role of signal peptidase. Cells of this strain were examined by pulse-chase at 37°C again using anti-Kar2p antibodies. Evidence that pCM111 bearing SEC11 complemented the sec11 mutant was demonstrated by the presence of mature Kar2p (lanes1-4), which has an increased electrophoretic mobility on sizing gels as compared with preKar2p. Importantly, the data show that upon restoration of signal peptidase activity, a proteolytic fragment (f1) was produced during the chase period (lanes2-4). To decrease the likelihood that high temperature-induced cellular aberrations unrelated to Sec11p are the cause for the"

https://openalex.org/W2025820044,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent mitogen for many cell lineages including fetal cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, bFGF has been shown to modify gene expression, in vitro, in adult nonproliferative ventricular myocytes. This effect is suspected to be partly responsible for the genetic modifications that occur in vivo under pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia or pressure overload and that lead to myocardial hypertrophy. However, little is known about the first steps of the molecular mechanisms that take place soon after cell activation by bFGF. In this study, using biochemical and electrophysiological approaches, we have established, on cardiomyocytes cultured from neonatal rat ventricles, that (i) differentiated beating cells express at least two classes of bFGF-receptors having high and low affinity (Kd = 10 +/- 2 pM and 1 +/- 0.5 nM); (ii) the stimulation of these bFGF receptors promotes an increase in the beating frequencies of cultured cardiomyocytes (40 +/- 10%); (iii) bFGF provokes the activation of poorly specific and voltage-independent calcium channels (12pS); (iv) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate enhances similar bFGF-induced Ca2+ currents and is therefore suspected to be a second messenger triggering this activation. These results support the presence, in cultured cardiomyocytes, of new calcium channels whose activation after bFGF binding may be partly responsible for the cell response to this growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W2086264316,"We have shown previously that guinea pig alveolar macrophages (AM) synthesize a secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) during in vitro incubation. Here, we report the molecular cloning of this enzyme and show that it has structural features closely related to all known mammalian type-II PLA2. The mRNA and PLA2 activity were undetectable in freshly collected AM, but their levels increased dramatically to reach maximal values after 16 h of culture. Thereafter, the PLA2 activity remained constant with a parallel secretion in the medium, in contrast to mRNA level which returned to near basal values after 32 h. Incubation of AM for 16 h with the inflammatory secretagogue peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) markedly reduced the PLA2 activity and mRNA levels. This inhibition was prevented by preexposure of AM to pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of G-protein. In contrast, when AM were first cultured for 16 h and then incubated with fMLP, no significant change was observed in their PLA2 activity. In conditions where the type-II PLA2 was completely abrogated by fMLP, the latter did not alter the lipopolysaccharide-induced accumulation of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA or the release of arachidonic acid induced by the subsequent addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. These studies show that the inflammatory peptide fMLP down-regulates the expression of the type-II PLA2 by AM through a process mediated by G-protein.

Mammalian PLA2s are generally divided into two major groups, the secretory or low molecular mass (14-18 kDa) forms, termed sPLA2 and the cytosolic or high molecular mass (85 kDa) form, termed cPLA2. The sPLA2 are divided into two different types: the pancreatic (type-I) PLA2 and the non-pancreatic (type-II) PLA2(3Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

Lefort J. Simon M.T. Vargaftig B.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We show that fMLP down-regulates the expression of this enzyme through a G-protein-mediated process. This effect is due to a decrease of sPLA2 mRNA level and was not accompanied by an alteration of AA release. Male Hartley guinea pigs were obtained from Elevages Saint Antoine (Pleudaniel, France). RPMI 1640 culture medium, fetal calf serum (FCS), and HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ were from Life Technologies, Inc. Hepes, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), leupeptin, aprotinin, L-glutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, fMLP, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Sodium pentobarbital was from Sanofi Laboratories (Montpellier, France). LPS Escherichia coli 055:B5 was from Difco Laboratories. Fluorescent phospholipid (1-palmitoyl-2-(10-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glyceromonomethylphosphatidic acid, PA) was from Interchim (Montluon, France). [3H]Arachidonic acid ([3H]AA, 80-135 Ci/mmol), nylon membranes and DNA labeling kit (random priming) were from Amersham Corp. Products for staining cytocentrifuge smears (modified May-Grünwald-Giemsa) were from Diff-Quik (Duedingen, Switzerland). [32P]dCTP was from ICN Biochemicals France (Orsay, France). Male Hartley guinea pigs weighting 600-1000 × g were anesthetized by the intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (20 mg/kg). Twenty successive bronchoalveolar lavages were performed sterilly with 5-ml aliquots of saline, containing 25 μg/ml streptomycin and 25 units/ml penicillin, which were injected with a plastic syringe through a polyethylene cannula inserted into the trachea. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 475 × g for 10 min at 25°C, and the pellets were washed twice with saline containing 25 μg/ml streptomycin and 25 units/ml penicillin. The washed cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 2 mML-glutamine, 10 mM Hepes, 0.4% BSA (w/v), and 10% FCS (v/v), pH 7.2, and adjusted at 3 × 106 cells/ml. Differential counts were made on modified May-Grünwald-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge smears. The composition of the major cell types in the bronchoalveolar lavages fluids comprised 85.7 ± 6.3% alveolar macrophages, 8.6 ± 2.3% eosinophils, and 5.7 ± 3.4% lymphocytes. The cells were adjusted at 3 × 106 cells/ml and allowed to adhere in 35-mm culture dishes during 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air. At this step, the cell population of adherent cells consisted of 95-99% macrophages after the first hour of adhesion. The plates were then washed three times with medium (37°C) and incubated with RPMI 1640 containing 3% FCS. AM were incubated for different time periods with or without fMLP (1 μM, otherwice stated). In certain experiments, AM were first allowed to adhere for 16 h and then incubated with fMLP. When appropriatly, PTX was incubated with AM for 3 h in the presence of 10% FCS. The cells were washed twice and reincubated with PTX in the presence or in the absence of 1 μM fMLP for 16 h. Peritoneal lavages were performed sterilly with 5-ml aliquots of saline containing 20 units/ml heparin used to prevent cell aggregation. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 475 × g for 10 min at 25°C, and the pellets were washed twice with saline containing 25 μg/ml streptomycin and 25 units/ml penicillin. After this step, PM were isolated by adhesion using the same procedure as for AM. Twenty milliliters of arterial blood were collected in a tube containing 2 ml of acid citrate dextrose as an anticoagulant (2.5 mg of citrate trisodium + 1.4 g of citric acid + 2 g of glucose/ml). Blood was mixed in sterile conditions with 4 ml of 0.9% NaCl supplemented with 6% dextran (molecular weight 295,000; B-512, Sigma) and allowed to sediment for 30 min at room temperature. The leukocyte-rich plasma was aspirated and mixed with an equal volume of RPMI and carefully layered over 3 ml of Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia) in 15-ml plastic siliconized tubes and centrifuged at 475 × g for 40 min at room temperature. The white cell-rich fraction, which settled at the Ficoll-Paque surface, was removed and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS. The cells were adjusted to 4 × 106 cells/ml and allowed to adhere for 1 h in the presence of 5 units/ml heparin to avoid cell aggregation. The plates were then washed three times with medium and incubated for 16 h with RPMI in the presence of 10% FCS in 35-mm culture dishes. Total RNA was prepared after 16-h adherence of AM by using the Chomczynski and Sacchi method(8Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Then, 5′ and 3′ RACE-RT-PCR (rapid amplification of cDNA ends-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) techniques were used to generate the full-length guinea pig type-II PLA2 cDNA from alveolar macrophages as described by Frohman(9Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from AM total RNA with an adaptor-d(T) primer 5′-AACCCGGCTCGAGCGGCCGC(T)15 (primer 1) and Superscript RT as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland). PCR amplifications were in 100 μl of buffer containing 1 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 3 units of Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The primers used to clone the 3′ extremity were primer 1 and human type-II PLA2-specific primer, 5′-CGTCTGGAGAAACGTGGATGT. PCR amplifications were done using 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 43°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s. To clone the 5′ extremity, single-strand cDNA was synthesized with primer 1 as above. After RNA hydrolysis by RNaseH, a dC tail was added with deoxynucleotidyl terminal transferase. The tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR with oligodeoxynucleotides 5′-GCGCCCAGTGTGCTGGCTGCA(G)11 (primer 2) and guinea pig type-II PLA2-specific primer cDNA 5′-TGACAGGAGTTCTGCTTTAC, followed by two additional amplifications with primers 2 and 5′-TGCAGGTGATCGAGCTCC. PCR amplifications were done using 40 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, 43°C for 15 s, 72°C for 60 s. Full-length transcript contains 760 nucleotides and was subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). COS-1 kidney SV40-transformed African green monkey cells (ATCC CRL 1650) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and 10% FCS. Full-length PLA2 cDNA was excised from the pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with EcoRI and HindIII sites and subcloned into the same sites of the pcDNA 1 eucaryotic expression vector (In Vitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands). Approximately 8 × 106 cells were transfected with 10 μg of purified supercoiled plasmid DNA in 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS, 10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl by electroporation (260 V and 960 microfarads). Cells were removed after 48 h of incubation at 37°C/5% CO2, washed in PBS buffer, and lysed as indicated above before the measurement of PLA2 activity. Cells were isolated and cultured as indicated above. Total RNA (10 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel with the formaldehyde method (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and then transferred onto nylon membranes. The blots were hybridized at 68°C overnight as described by Church and Gilbert(11Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), using a 32P-labeled (random priming) full-length guinea pig type-II PLA2 cDNA as a probe, and washed in 3 × SSC and 5% SDS, followed by 1 × SSC and 1% SDS washes. Blots were washed off and rehybridized with rat β-actin cDNA at 65°C, as internal control (1 × SSC = 0.5 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate; SDS = sodium dodecyl sulfate). AM were incubated with 10 μg/ml LPS in the presence or in the absence of 1 μM fMLP. After a 16-h incubation, total RNA was extracted and electrophoresed as indicated above. The blots were hybridized at 62°C overnight with a 32P-labeled fragment of murine TNFα cDNA corresponding to amino acids 83-184. At the end of the incubations, culture supernatants were harvested and centrifuged at 1500 × g during 5 min at 4°C to remove detached cells, and aliquots of 200 μl were stored at −20°C until use. The culture dishes were kept in an ice bath, and adherent cells were washed and scrapped with a rubber policeman in 0.5 ml of cold HBSS containing 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mM EDTA. Cells were then lysed by ultrasonication and kept at −20°C until use. The measurement of sPLA2 activity was carried out using the fluorometric assay described by Radvanyi et al.(12Radvanyi F. Jordan L. Russo-Marie F. Bon C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and shown to be selective for the sPLA2 type(6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar). The fluorescent PA was dried under nitrogen and suspended in ethanol at a concentration of 0.2 mM. Vesicles were prepared by mixing the ethanol solution of the fluorescent phospholipid with a buffer solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA (pH 7.5). After 2 min of vigourous agitation, 980 μl of substrat solution were mixed with 10 μl of 10% fatty acid-free BSA. Macrophage homogenates were maintained in an ice-cold bath throughout the experiment and aliquots (10 to 50 μl) were introduced into the cuvettes and allowed to equilibrate at 37°C for 1 min. The reactions were then initiated with 10 μl of CaCl2 at a 10 mM final concentration in 4 × 10 mm disposable plastic cuvettes. The fluorescence measurements were performed with a Jobin et Yvon JY3D spectrofluorometer equiped with a xenon lamp and monitored using excitation and emission wavelengths of 345 and 398 nm, respectively, with a slitwidth of 4 nm. AA Release After 16 h incubation, AM were washed twice with RPMI 3% FCS to remove nonadherent cells and then incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]AA (final concentration) for 2 h in RPMI containing 3% FCS and 0.4% BSA, at 37°C in 5% CO2, 95% air. The plates were washed three times with the medium (37°C) to remove the unincorporated [3H]AA and reincubated in serum-free medium containing 0.4% BSA. Aliquots (50 μl) were taken off from the supernatant before cell washing, to determine the extent of [3H]AA incorporation. Labeled AM were stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μM) or its vehicle Me2SO (0.1%) for different time periods (1-60 min) at 37°C. The radioactivity in 50 μl of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotom-etry, with ACS II as a scintillation liquid. Control experiments showed that the vehicle Me2SO had no effect on AA release. Cell viability was checked by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Cell lysis was controlled by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the medium using a commercial kit from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of separate experiments, and statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test (*, p < 0.05;, p < 0.01). The type-II PLA2 was cloned by RACE-RT-PCR from AM as described under “Methods.” The deduced amino-acid sequence of the guinea pig protein has all the mammalian type-II PLA2 characteristics. The mature protein consists of 125 amino acids and shows 70% sequence identity with human type-II PLA2 and 35% with guinea pig type-I PLA2 (Fig. 1). To further characterize the PLA2 cloned from AM, the cDNA was transfected into COS cells as described under “Methods.” COS cells transfected with the PLA2 construct expressed > 150 times more PLA2 activity than cells transfected with the vector alone. The PLA2 activity produced by transfected COS cells had characteristics similar to those of guinea pig AM (6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar) and other mammalian type-II PLA2(3Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 4Glaser K.M. Mobilio D.

Lipid Med. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the enzyme hydrolyzed preferentially negatively charged phospholipids PA > PG and, at much lower rate, PC, with optimal activity being observed at pH 7-8 and 10 mM calcium. The type-II PLA2 activity and mRNA were undetectable when freshly collected AM were allowed to adhere for 1 h in the presence of 3% FCS. However, both PLA2 activity and mRNA level increased dramatically to reach maximal values after 16 h of incubation of AM. The PLA2 activity remained at maximal level over 32 h incubation with a parallel secretion in the medium, in contrast to mRNA level, which returned to near basal level after 32 h of incubation (Fig. 2, a and b). The expression of the type-II PLA2 activity and mRNA did not require the presence of serum in the medium and was not due to contaminating endotoxin (data not shown), thus confirming our previous findings(6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar). We also investigated the expression of the type-II PLA2 in guinea pig peritoneal macrophages (PM) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). These cells expressed the type-II PLA2 at much lower levels than AM. Indeed, very low or undetectable levels of PLA2 activity and mRNA were observed in PM and PBM cultured for 16 h in the same conditions (Table 1, Fig. 3). The low expression of PLA2 activity in PM and PBM may be due to the presence of heparin (used during PM and PBM isolation; see “Methods”), which may interfere with the PLA2 enzymatic assay. This is not the case since addition of heparin (1-20 units/ml) directly to the cuvettes did not interfere with the PLA2 fluorometric assay. Furthermore, addition of heparin (20 units/ml) to the bronchoalveolar lavage or during the first hour of adhesion of AM failed to inhibit the expression of PLA2 activity of AM measured after a 16-h culture (data not shown).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Since AM are a target for a variety of inflammatory stimuli in the lung, we investigated the effects of the chemoattractant peptide fMLP on the expression of the type-II PLA2 in AM. Incubation of AM with 1 μM fMLP led to a marked and prolonged decrease in cell-associated PLA2 activity (Fig. 4a). This effect was concentration-dependent with a parallel decrease in the level of PLA2 activity in the medium (Fig. 5). FMLP had no effect on cell viability as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release and trypan blue exclusion test (data not shown). Northern blot analysis showed that incubation of AM with fMLP led to a marked decrease of mRNA level (Fig. 4b). In addition, preincubation of AM for 3 h with PTX prevented almost totally the inhibitory effect of fMLP on the expression of the type-II PLA2 in AM. By itself, PTX had no significant effect on PLA2 activity and mRNA level (Fig. 6, a and b).Figure 5:Concentration-dependent effect of fMLP on cell- and medium-associated PLA2 activity. AM were incubated with increasing concentrations of fMLP for 16 h, and PLA2 activity was measured in cells (○) and cell-free (•) supernatants. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Supression by pertussis toxin of the inhibitory effect of fMLP on type-II PLA2 expression in AM. AM were allowed to adhere for 3 h in the presence or in the absence of PTX (50 ng/ml). The plates were washed and reincubated with or without fMLP (1 μM) in the presence or in the absence of PTX (50 ng/ml). After 16 h incubation, PLA2 activity (a) and type-II PLA2 mRNA (b) were analyzed as indicated under “Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiments cited above, fMLP was added to AM before the synthesis of PLA2 took place. We next examined whether fMLP interferes with the expression of PLA2 when added to AM after enzyme synthesis. AM were first allowed to adhere for 16 h (incubation period leading to a maximum of type-II PLA2 synthesis) and then incubated with fMLP for an additional period. In these conditions, no significant change in the PLA2 activity was observed as compared to untreated AM (data not shown). This is not due to the failure of fMLP to stimulate 16-h-old AM, since the latter released substantial amounts of AA metabolites when incubated with fMLP(6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar). These experiments were performed to investigate whether the inhibition of the type-II PLA2 expression is due to a nonspecific effect of fMLP. We first examined the effect of fMLP on the LPS-induced TNFα expression. Fig. 7 shows that incubation of AM with 10 μg/ml LPS for 16 h led to a marked TNFα mRNA accumulation. Similar levels of TNFα mRNA were observed when AM were incubated with combination of fMLP and LPS (Fig. 8). By itself, fMLP induced a weakly detectable accumulation of TNFα mRNA.Figure 8:Failure of AM pretreatment with fMLP to interfere with the ionophore-induced AA release. AM were incubated with or without fMLP (1 μM) for 16 h and incubated with [3H]AA (1 μCi/ml, final concentration) at 37°C for 2 h. Then, the plates were washed three times with the medium (37°C) to remove the unincorporated [3H]AA and stimulated with 1 μM calcium ionophore A23187 (□) or with its vehicle Me2SO (▪). After 30 min of stimulation, the radioactivity in 50 μl of the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry, with ACS II as a scintillation liquid. The results show the release of AA expressed in cpm × 10−3/ml and are the mean ± S.E. of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition, we examined whether preincubation of AM with fMLP modifies their ability to release AA when stimulated with a second stimulus, the calcium ionophore A23187. AM were cultured for 16 h, labeled with [3H]AA for 2 h and then stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187. This led to a time-dependent release of AA which plateaued after 30 min (data not shown). This release was not altered when AM were preincubated with fMLP for 16 h before stimulation with the calcium ionophore (Fig. 8). No significant difference was observed in the levels of [3H]AA incorporation between untreated- and fMLP-treated AM (62.5 ± 4.5 and 55.4 ± 5.9, n = 8, respectively, expressed as percent of total added [3H]AA). AM are cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system suitably positioned to participate in allergic and inflammatory reactions in the lung. They are a source and a target of numerous inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and AA derivatives. The release of AA in activated cells is mainly catalyzed by PLA2, although the type of PLA2 involved in this process varies with cell type and animal species. We have shown previously that guinea pig AM produce high level of a sPLA2 during in vitro incubation, although this enzyme was undetectable in freshly collected cells(6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar). We suggested that adherence of AM to plastic dishes and/or the removal of inhibitory factors present in the lung may be involved in the induction of sPLA2 synthesis by isolated AM. Indeed, recent studies from our laboratory suggest that pulmonary surfactant may be one of these inhibitory factors.2 2L. Touqui, R. Hidi, Z. Lahona, and B. B. Vargaftig, manuscript in preparation. In the present study, we have cloned this enzyme from AM and show that it has structural features similar to those of mammalian type-II PLA2. The type-II PLA2 mRNA was undetectable in freshly collected AM, but its level increased progressively in parallel to PLA2 activity. Furthermore, the increase of PLA2 activity was prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, suggesting a de novo synthesis of mRNA and protein(6Hidi R. Vargaftig B.B. Touqui L. J. Immunol. 1989; 151: 5613-5623Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that (i) in vitro incubation of AM induces type-II PLA2 gene expression and (ii) there is a direct correlation between mRNA level and PLA2 activity during the first 16 h of culture. However, the mRNA level reached its maximal level within 16 h and then returned to near basal values, in contrast to PLA2 activity which remained constant over 32 h of incubation. This suggests that (i) the enzyme is stored in stable form probably in granules as reported previously for other cell types (for review see (13Mayer R.J. Marshall L.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar)) and (ii) there is active translational and/or post-translational regulations of the this enzyme in AM in parallel to the regulation of its mRNA expression. Since AM derive from the differentiation of blood monocytes, we investigated whether other mononuclear phagocyte cells are able to produce the type-II PLA2 when cultured in the same conditions as AM. Our results show that this enzyme is produced at much lower levels in PBM and PM, suggesting that this process is linked to cell differentiation and associated specifically with airway macrophages. In a subsequent step, we investigated the regulation of the type-II PLA2 expression in fMLP-stimulated AM. The assumption was that an inflammatory stimulus such as fMLP would increase the activation and/or secretion of sPLA2, as described for cytosolic PLA2 products. Indeed, fMLP is known to induce a rapid release of AA by macrophages from different animal species, including guinea pig AM(7Boukili A.M. Bureau M.F. Lellouch-Tubiana A. Lefort J. Simon M.T. Vargaftig B.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, and most surprisingly, incubation of AM with fMLP led to an almost total repression of synthesis and secretion of the type-II PLA2. The inhibitory effect of fMLP involved a G-protein-mediated process, since it was prevented when AM were pretreated with PTX before the addition of fMLP. Moreover, this inhibition occurred at mRNA level expression, since it was accompanied by a dramatic decrease of the type-II PLA2 mRNA accumulation. It is unlikely that incubation of AM with fMLP led to proteolytic degradation of the PLA2 protein, since no alteration was observed in the PLA2 activity when AM were first cultured for 16 h (to allow maximal accumulation of the enzyme) and then incubated with fMLP for additional periods. However, further investigations are required to examine whether PLA2 undergoes post-translational modifications in fMLP-stimulated AM. On the other hand, our results clearly show that the fMLP-induced inhibition of the type-II PLA2 expression is not due to a nonspecific effect of fMLP. Indeed, fMLP failed to interfere with LPS-induced TNFα expression or with the release of AA induced by the subsequent addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. This also indicates that inhibition of the type-II PLA2 synthesis is not accompanied by an alteration of the ability of AM to release AA, suggesting that this enzyme may not mediate AA release induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. However, the role of this enzyme in the release of AA is still controversial and seems to be dependent on cell types and animal species(14Mounier C. Faili A. Vargaftig B.B. Bon C. Hatmi M. Eur. J.

In summary, the present studies show, for the first time, cloning and expression of the type-II PLA2 in a cell involved in lung inflammation. The pathophysiological relevance of these studies is related to the use of guinea pig as an experimental model for human allergic disease, particularly immediate bronchoconstriction and delayed bronchopulmonary hyperresponsiveness(21Pretolani M. Vargaftig B.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is compelling evidence for a central role of sPLA2 in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury(4Glaser K.M. Mobilio D. Chang J.Y. Senko N. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 92-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Vadas P. Browning J. Edelson J. Pruzanski W. J. Lipid Med. 1993; 8: 1-30PubMed Google Scholar). We also report that the expression of sPLA2 in AM is down-regulated by an inflammatory stimulus, suggesting a possible negative control of the expression of this enzyme during AM activation. This down-regulation involves a G protein-mediated process. The mechanisms and intracellular messengers linking G-protein activation and sPLA2 down-regulation are under investigation.

These studies suggest that halothreonine derivatives that generate electrophilic aldehyde products will be effective inhibitors of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and might be potentially useful chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1976420293,"We are using the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex as a model system to investigate how ligands, protein-protein interaction, and mutations regulate enzyme activity, reaction specificity, and substrate specificity. The rate of conversion of L-serine and indole to L-tryptophan by the β2 subunit alone is quite low, but is activated by certain monovalent cations or by association with α subunit to form an α2β2 complex. Since monovalent cations and α subunit appear to stabilize an active conformation of the β2 subunit, we have investigated the effects of monovalent cations on the activities and spectroscopic properties of a mutant form of α2β2 complex having β2 subunit glutamic acid 109 replaced by alanine (E109A). The E109A α2β2 complex is inactive in reactions with L-serine but active in reactions with β-chloro-L-alanine. Parallel experiments show effects of monovalent cations on the properties of wild type β2 subunit and α2β2 complex. We find that CsCl stimulates the activity of the E109A α2β2 complex and of wild type β2 subunit with L-serine and indole and alters the equilibrium distribution of L-serine reaction intermediates. The results indicate that CsCl partially repairs the deleterious effects of the E109A mutation on the activity of the α2β2 complex by stabilizing a conformation with catalytic properties more similar to those of the wild type α2β2 complex. This conclusion is consistent with observations that monovalent cations alter the catalytic and spectroscopic properties of several pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes by stabilizing alternative conformations.

This conclusion is consistent with observations that monovalent cations alter the catalytic and spectroscopic properties of several pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes by stabilizing alternative conformations. The regulation of enzyme activity and of substrate specificity is a problem of critical importance in biology. Enzyme activity can be modulated by interaction of the enzyme with ligands or with other proteins. These interactions produce changes in protein conformation or alter the equilibrium distribution of preexisting conformations. Mutations can also modulate enzyme activity by altering protein conformation. In the present work we ask whether ligands that stabilize the active conformation of an enzyme can also repair the deleterious effects of a mutation that leads to an inactive conformation. Tryptophan synthase (EC 4.2.1.20) is a classic system for investigating how ligands, protein-protein interaction, and mutations regulate enzyme activity and substrate specificity (for reviews, see (1Yanofsky C.

The separate α subunit catalyzes the reversible aldolytic cleavage of indole-3-glycerol phosphate to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and indole, termed the α reaction. The separate β2 subunit catalyzes the condensation of L-serine with indole to form L-tryptophan in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent β-replacement reaction, termed the β reaction. The interaction of the α and β2 subunits in the α2β2 complex serves to increase the rates of the α and β reactions up to 100-fold, increase substrate binding affinities, and alter reaction specificities. These changes are attributed to conformational changes which occur upon assembly of the complex(6Lane A.N. Paul C.H. Kirschner K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of a ligand or the formation of a reaction intermediate at the active site of either subunit in the α2β2 complex alters the reaction kinetics at the heterologous active site ∼25 Å distant(7Lane A.N.

The combined results suggest that the α and β2 subunits undergo conformational changes during catalysis and exist in two or more conformations that have been designated “open” and “closed” (11Brzovic' P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Investigations of the reaction and substrate specificities of wild type and mutant forms of the β2 subunit and the α2β2 complex also provide evidence that the β2 subunit can exist in two different conformational states (designated I and II in Table 1)(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brzovic' P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F.

The separate β2 subunit catalyzes β-replacement and β-elimination reactions with a variety of amino acids that have an electronegative substituent in the β-position (e.g.L-serine and β-chloro-L-alanine)(19Kumagai H.

Thus association with the α subunit alters the reaction specificity of the β2 subunit. Whereas L-serine is a better substrate than β-chloro-L-alanine for the β-replacement reaction with indole catalyzed by the α2β2 complex, the reverse is true for the β2 subunit(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus association with the α subunit alters the substrate specificity of the β2 subunit. Several α2β2 complexes with single amino acid replacements in the active site of the β2 subunit have substrate and reaction specificities similar to those of the wild type β2 subunit(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding led us to suggest that the wild type β2 subunit and these mutant α2β2 complexes exist in open conformations (I in Table 1), whereas the wild type α2β2 complex exists in a closed conformation (II in Table 1)(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliphatic alcohols also stabilize an alternative conformation of the α2β2 complex that has properties similar to that of the free β2 subunit in aqueous solution (21Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16486-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (I in Table 1). Early studies showed that some monovalent cations (K+, Li+, and NH4+, but not Na+) activate the β2 subunit (22Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka M. White E.A. Horibata K. Crawford I.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in β-replacement and β-elimination reactions with L-serine. High concentrations of NH4+ in some ways mimic the effects of the α subunit on the kinetic and spectroscopic properties of the β2 subunit(24Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Miles E.W. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 1974; 249: 2852-2857Google Scholar, 26York S.S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Li+, Rb+, NH4+, and Cs+) activate the wild type tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex and alter the pH-dependent equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates(27Dunn M.F.

Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Together the results support the idea that both the free β2 subunit and the α2β2 complex exist in two or more conformations. Preferential binding of certain monovalent cations to a specific site in the β2 subunit may alter the equilibrium distribution of preexisting conformations in the β2 subunit and α2β2 complex by stabilizing conformation II (Table 1). Binding of an α subunit ligand (α-glycerol 3-phosphate) to the α2β2 complex also alters the distribution of intermediates formed with L-serine(32Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Bettati S. Rossi G.L. Fukui T. Kagamiyama H. Soda K. Wada H. Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon Press, Oxford1991: 273-275Crossref Google Scholar). Table 1 indicates that α site ligands stabilize conformation II. Because certain cations and α site ligands appear to stabilize the more active conformation II of wild type β2 subunit and α2β2 complex (Table 1), we reasoned that these ligands might promote the conversion of a mutant α2β2 complex from an inactive conformation I to an active conformation II. In the present work we have investigated the effects of monovalent cations on a mutant α2β2 complex having Glu-109 of the β2 subunit replaced by alanine (E109A). Glu-109 is located in a region of the β2 subunit adjacent to the covalently bound pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and near the putative indole-binding site of the β2 subunit (see Fig. 1 in (17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). It has been postulated that the carboxylate of Glu-109 may activate the indole toward nucleophilic attack on the aminoacrylate (33Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. FASEB J. 1990; 4: A2118Google Scholar) and/or activation of the β-hydroxyl of L-serine as a leaving group(18Brzovic' P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The finding that the E109A α2β2 complex can synthesize L-tryptophan from β-chloro-L-alanine and indole but not from L-serine and indole provides evidence that Glu-109 is not an essential residue for the activation of indole but may serve to activate the β hydroxyl of L-serine as a leaving group(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brzovic' P.S. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F.

Enzymes Dependent on Pyridoxal Phosphate and Other Carbonyl Compounds as Cofactors. Pergamon Press, Oxford1991: 265-267Crossref Google Scholar). Alternatively, replacement of Glu-109 by alanine (17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or aspartate (16Anderson K.S. Miles E.W. Johnson K.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) may introduce structural changes within the β2 subunit that alter the conformation of the α2β2 complex and thereby alter the substrate and reaction specificity. Our finding that the E109A α2β2 complex resembles the wild type β2 subunit in substrate specificity and reaction specificity suggests that the mutation stabilizes conformation I (see “mutations” in Table 1). The results reported here show that addition of a high concentration of CsCl partially restores the activity of the E109A α2β2 complex with L-serine and alters the substrate and reaction specificity. The results suggest that CsCl repairs a conformational defect in the E109A α2β2 complex by stabilizing conformation II that has structural and catalytic properties more similar to those of the wild type α2β2 complex.

Protein concentrations were determined from the specific absorbance at 278 nm of the α2β2 complex (E1% = 6.0) or of the β2 subunit (E1% = 6.5)(38Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A.

One unit of activity in any reaction is the formation of 0.1 μmol of product in 20 min at 37°C. β-Replacement reactions with L-serine or β-chloro-L-alanine and indole were measured by a direct spectrophotometric assay (38Miles E.W.

Absorption spectra were made using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer. Time course measurements of enzymatic activities at single wavelengths were made using a Cary 118 spectrophotometer. The results reported here were all carried out in 50 mM sodium N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine containing 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.8, since we had used this buffer for previous related experiments(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Na+ does not activate the separate β2 subunit(22Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Hatanaka M. White E.A. Horibata K. Crawford I.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), recent studies show that Na+ does activate the wild type α2β2 complex(27Dunn M.F. Brzovic' P.S. Leja C. Pan P. Woehl E.U.

Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). These recent studies utilized triethanolamine and bis-tris propane buffers that contain no monovalent cations and are thus better suited for studies of the effects of cations. Because Na+ in our buffer (∼50 mM) may compete with other cations for the same binding site, our results do not show the effects of the absolute concentrations of other cations. However, our results do show that other cations have striking effects on the properties of the wild type β2 subunit and α2β2 complex and on the E109A α2β2 complex. Table 2 shows the effects of various monovalent cations as their chlorides (0.2 M) on the specific activity of the wild type β2 subunit in the β-replacement reactions with L-serine and indole and with β-chloro-L-alanine and indole. Addition of Li+ or NH4+ significantly stimulates activity with L-serine and indole, as found previously with partially purified β2 subunit from Escherichia coli(23Hatanaka M. White E.A. Horibata K. Crawford I.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 596-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the β2 subunit by Rb+ and Cs+ is reported for the first time. Because Cs+ gave the greatest stimulation, Cs+ was selected for further study. The monovalent cations have much smaller effects on the activities with β-chloro-L-alanine plus indole. Thus the monovalent cations that increase the activity with L-serine and indole alter the substrate specificity by increasing the ratio of activity with L-serine to activity with β-chloro-L-alanine (see serine:β-chloro-L-alanine activity ratio in Table 2). Note that the ratio of activities with L-serine and β-chloro-L-alanine is one of the features that distinguish the postulated conformations I and II (Table 1).TABLE II Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the effects of CsCl concentration on activity in the β-replacement reaction with L-serine and indole. Low concentrations of CsCl activate the wild type α2β2 complex (A) and β2 subunit (B). High concentrations of CsCl activate the E109A α2β2 complex (C) but inhibit the wild type α2β2 complex (A). The α subunit ligand, GP, alters the effect of CsCl concentration on the activities of the wild type and E109A α2β2 complexes. The activity data in Fig. 1 can be represented by a model (see Table 3) which assumes the noncooperative binding of CsCl to one or two classes of sites on the protein with average dissociation constants K1 and K2. The binding of CsCl converts the enzyme from the CsCl free form X to CsCl-bound forms Y or Z, with concomitant changes in activity. Addition of higher concentrations of CsCl (100-3000 mM) to the wild type α2β2 complex (Fig. 1A) produces further changes of the activity which vary monotonically with salt concentration. These changes could result from additional binding at very weak sites on the protein or from the non-ideal behavior of concentrated salt solutions. For the purpose of curve fitting, these changes are expressed as a linear function of salt concentration and described as a “solvent effect” in Table 3. The curves shown in Fig. 1, A-C, were the best fits to this model. Table 3 describes the model and the derived dissociation constants. The results give no indication of the stoichiometry of the reaction between CsCl and the enzyme.TABLE III Open table in a new tab The absorption spectra of the wild type α2β2 complex (Fig. 2A), β2 subunit (Fig. 2B), and E109A α2β2 complex (Fig. 2C) are very similar in the absence of L-serine. Each enzyme exhibits a major peak centered at 412 nm due to the internal aldimine formed between pyridoxal phosphate and β2 subunit Lys-87 (E in Fig. SI). Reaction of the wild type α2β2 complex with L-serine in the presence or absence of CsCl yields a complex spectrum with a major peak centered at 340 nm (Fig. 2A), which is ascribed to the pyridoxal phosphate-amino acrylate Schiff base (E-AA in Fig. SI). Reaction of the β2 subunit (Fig. 2B) or E109A α2β2 complex (Fig. 2C) with L-serine in the absence of CsCl yields an absorption spectrum with maximum absorbance at 424 nm. This intermediate is the external aldimine of pyridoxal phosphate with L-serine (E-Ser in Fig. SI) and exhibits an intense fluorescence emission at 510 nm. Addition of increasing concentrations of CsCl to the β2 subunit (Fig. 2B) or the E109A α2β2 complex (Fig. 2C) results in decreased absorbance at 424 nm, increased absorbance at 340 nm, and decreased fluorescence emission at 510 nm (fluorescence data not shown). Thus CsCl alters the equilibrium distribution of ES-Ser and ES-AA intermediates with the β2 subunit and the E109A α2β2 complex.Figure SI:Scheme I. Reactions of the wild type tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Globular proteins are flexible molecules and can have two or more conformations in solution. Ligand or substrate binding may produce changes in protein conformation or alter the equilibrium distribution of preexisting conformations. The results reported above show the effects of two ligands (Cs+ and α-glycerol 3-phosphate) on the catalytic properties and spectroscopic properties of wild type and mutant forms of tryptophan synthase. We conclude that Cs+ stabilizes the active conformation of tryptophan synthase and partially repairs the deleterious effects of a mutation that leads to an inactive conformation. Our analysis (Table 3) of the activity data in Fig. 1 indicates that Cs+ binds to two classes of sites in the wild type and E109A α2β2 complexes and to one class of sites in the wild type β2 subunit. Low concentrations of Cs+ activate the wild type α2β2 complex (Kd = 25 mM) and the wild type β2 subunit (Kd = 43 mM). Because ∼50 mM Na+ is present in our assay mixture, the activity of the wild type α2β2 complex in the absence of CsCl is significantly higher than the activity in the absence of any monovalent cation(27Dunn M.F.

Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The cited results indicate that monovalent cations convert the wild type α2β2 complex from conformation I that is less active in the β reaction to a more active conformation II as shown in Table 1. Our results in Table 3 indicate that low concentrations of Cs+ convert the wild type α2β2 complex from a less active form X to a more active form Y. High concentrations of Cs+ decrease the activity of the wild type α2β2 complex. The shape of the curve in Fig. 1A (-GP) suggests that these high concentrations of CsCl may have a solvent effect and favor a less active conformation Z (Table 3). Since 3 M CsCl does not alter the far- and near-UV circular dichroism spectra of the wild type α2β2 complex (data not shown), effects of this high concentration of CsCl must have subtle, rather than gross, effects on the conformation. Addition of GP, an analogue of the α subunit substrates indole-3-glycerol phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, inhibits the activity of the wild type α2β2 complex in the β reaction (Fig. 1A) as found previously(39Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10715-10718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition is greatest near the concentration of CsCl that gives maximum activity in the absence of GP. This result suggests that the most active form of the α2β2 complex (form Y in Table 3) is most susceptible to this allosteric inhibition. It is possible that the step which is inhibited by α-glycerol 3-phosphate is rate-limiting for form Y of the α2β2 complex but is only partially rate-limiting for forms X and Z. Our finding CsCl alters the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates (ES-Ser and ES-AA in Fig. SI) with the β2 subunit (Fig. 1B) is consistent with early studies on the effects of NH4+ on the spectroscopic properties of the β2 subunit with L-serine(24Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NH4+ was also found to alter the presteady state kinetics of interconversion of ES-Ser and ES-AA(26York S.S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In some ways high concentrations of NH4+ mimic the effects of the α subunit on the properties of the β2 subunit. NH4+ or α subunit increases the rate of formation of E-Ser and increases the rate of conversion of E-Ser to E-AA (Fig. SI). The conversion of E-Ser to E-AA is rate-limiting in the absence of NH4+ or α subunit(25Miles E.W. McPhie P. Biochemistry. 1974; 249: 2852-2857Google Scholar). Addition of Cs+ to the α2β2 complex having the E109A mutation in the β2 subunit partially restores the activity with L-serine and indole (Fig. 1C) and makes the spectroscopic properties in the presence of L-serine (Fig. 2C) more like those of the wild type α2β2 complex (Fig. 2A). These results provide evidence that a high concentration of Cs+ stabilizes conformation II of the E109A α2β2 complex that is more active in the β reaction. Alternatively, high concentrations of Cs+ might prevent dissociation of the E109A α2β2 complex to separate α and β2 subunits under assay conditions. A strong argument against this possibility is provided by our previous finding that addition of GP results in an 80% inhibition of the activity of the wild type and E109A α2β2 complexes in the β-replacement reaction with β-chloro-L-alanine and indole, but does not inhibit the corresponding activity of the separate β2 subunit(17Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B. Kayastha A.M. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21548-21557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Related previous studies have shown that addition of a high concentration of NH4+ partially restores the activity of a mutationally altered form of the β2 subunit found in E. coli strain A2B17(22Crawford I.P. Ito J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This type of mutant has been termed “repairable” because it has activity with L-serine in the β reaction in the presence, but not in the absence, of the α subunit. Ammonium ions often work synergistically with α subunits in the activation of other repairable β2 subunits(40Crawford I.P. Johnson L.M. Genetics. 1963; 48: 725-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high concentration of NH4+ also partially restores the activity of a mutant form of the β2 subunit (B8) that has an amino acid substitution in the “hinge” region(41Zhao G.-P. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 526-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Zhao G.-P. Somerville R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14921-14931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggest a functional role for the hinge region in the process of conformational switching. Studies in progress in our laboratory reveal that moderate concentrations of Cs+ or NH4+ also partially restore the activities of a number of other mutant forms of the β2 subunit and α2β2 complex. Taken together the results of these studies support the model in Table 1 that monovalent cations and the α subunit stabilize conformation II of the wild type and mutant β2 subunits that is more active in the β reaction. It is important to obtain additional evidence for the nature of the conformational change postulated in Table 1.

(For an excellent recent review, see (30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar)). Because the available x-ray structures show that the monovalent cation binding sites are not located in the active site, the bound cations should be classified as allosteric effectors(30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). These allosteric effectors may activate the enzymes by stabilizing the active conformation or may play a more dynamic role. For an enzyme such as tryptophan synthase that catalyzes a reaction through a series of steps (see Fig. SI) monovalent cation binding could selectively lower the activation energy for a particular step and thus alter the equilibrium distribution of intermediates and the kinetics of specific steps(30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The crystal structure of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase reveals the location of two binding sites for alkali metal ions. One is located near the active site and accounts for the dependence of activity on K+ or Rb+(49Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Keller J.W. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange of Na+ for K+ at the location near the active site results in a gross change in the coordination geometry, in concerted rearrangement of the conformations of Ser50 and Tyr301, and in small structural changes extending far beyond the immediate surroundings of the metal ion(49Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Keller J.W. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 151-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 51Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Cowan S.W. Jansonius J.N.

The changes in the conformations of Ser50 and Tyr301, which are in the active site, may disrupt the productive binding of substrate. This change in conformation could drive the enzyme into an inactive (or low activity form) in which the bound substrate and the active site functional groups and/or the pyridoxal phosphate ring are improperly aligned for catalysis(30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). These important studies provide the groundwork for understanding the structural and functional roles of monvalent cations in other pyridoxal phosphate enzymes. The three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from S. typhimurium has been reported (53Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and described in several reviews(3Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 207-254Google Scholar, 30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Because the active sites of the α and β2 subunits are ∼25 Å apart, the observed effects of ligands that bind to each subunit on the properties of the partner subunit are allosteric in nature. Thus ligands that bind to the active site of the α subunit produce allosteric effects on the individual steps in reactions catalyzed by the β2 subunit (Fig. SI).

In addition, Woehl and Dunn (30Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 31Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) find that monovalent cations are essential for the allosteric activation of the α site by formation of E-AA (see Fig. SI) at the β site. The cited results and results herein support a role for monovalent cations as a switch that converts the low activity conformation I to a high activity conformation II (Table 1). Crystallographic studies of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex in progress show that Na+, K+, or Cs+ binds to a site near, but not in, the active site of the β2 subunit.2 2D. R. Davies, personal communication. The results of these studies should give new insights into the roles of monovalent cations in tryptophan synthase. In conclusion, to explain our finding that the wild type β2 subunit of tryptophan synthase and a mutant form of the α2β2 complex (β2 subunit-E109A) have no or low activity in reactions with L-serine but high activity in reactions with β-chloro-L-alanine, we propose that that these enzymes exist in a conformation (I) that results in the improper alignment of the weak hydroxyl leaving group of L-serine for β-elimination. We suggest that bound Cs+ stabilizes conformation II in which the hydroxyl group of L-serine is properly aligned for β-elimination. Thus Cs+ may stabilize alternative conformations of the wild type β2 subunit and E109A α2β2 complex that have structural and catalytic properties more similar to those of the wild type α2β2 complex."

Proteolytic cleavage analysis, together with two-dimensional separation techniques, identified the small G-protein specifically associating with the PDGF type-β receptor after ligand binding as a member of the Rho family. This was confirmed by demonstration that the small G-protein co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-PDGF receptor antibody was a substrate for the ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 exoenzyme.

A causal or sequential relationship of these PDGF-induced and tyrosine kinase-dependent phenomena to each other and to eventual DNA synthesis is suspected but not well established. We have recently reported that some signals, resulting in the induction of certain growth-related genes, can be transmitted by the PDGF receptor in the absence of tyrosine kinase activity(18Mundschau L.J. Forman L.W. Weng H. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16137-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PDGF receptor-activated signaling mechanisms and pathways other than those characterized previously must exist.GTP-binding proteins with intrinsic GTPase activity (G-proteins) frequently link cell surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways. They function by cycling between (inactive) GDP-bound and (active) GTP-bound states. The small G-protein p21ras has been implicated in mediating signals from a number of tyrosine kinase-type growth factor receptors, including the PDGF type-β receptor(19Quinones M.A. Mundschau L.J.

No close associations of the PDGF receptor and any small G-proteins, however, and no associations activated by ligand binding to the receptor, have been previously reported.In the present study we have investigated the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in PDGF-mediated signaling in normal fibroblasts. A technique reported recently for in situ protein labeling of nucleotide-binding proteins in permeabilized cells was utilized (27Peter M.E. She J. Huber L.A. Terhorst C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The method involves the introduction of [α-32P]GTP into permeabilized cells, followed by in situ periodate oxidation. The result was the generation by cross-linking of GTPoxi-labeled G-proteins(28Low A. Sprinzl M. Faulhammer H.G. Eur. J.

The sensitivity and specificity of this method allowed cross-linking of more than 50% of p21Ha-ras to [α-32P]GTPoxi in transfected fibroblasts. Heterotrimeric G-proteins (e.g. Giα-2) can also be labeled by this method(27Peter M.E. She J. Huber L.A. Terhorst C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

We have identified the small G-protein specifically associating with the PDGF type-β receptor after ligand binding as a member of the Rho family of G-proteins. On the basis of these results, this Rho G-protein is likely to be an important component of the proteins making up the multimeric signaling complex of the PDGF type-β receptor.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsBalb/c-3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Kirsten v-ras-transformed Balb/c-3T3 fibroblasts (KBalb) were described previously(32Zullo J.N. Faller D.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5080-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor calf serum (Sigma). When quiescent cells were required, monolayers were grown to confluence and then starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% donor calf serum. Dog kidney epithelial cells (TRMP) expressing wild type or a mutant human PDGF type-β receptor (L635R) were the generous gift of A. Kazlauskas and J. Cooper (33Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The L635R mutation made the receptor unable to bind ATP and therefore kinase-negative. These cells were maintained with a mixture 1:1 of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, including 400 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin.Antibodies and ReagentsAntiserum specific for the human PDGF type-β receptor, directed against amino acid sequence 1013-1025, and cross-reacting with mouse receptors was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Anti-p21ras monoclonal antibody Y13-259 (rat mAb-IgG1) directed against residues 63-76 was obtained from Oncogene Science.

Recombinant human PDGF-BB homodimer (PDGFhr-BB) was purchased from R& Systems. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from DuPont NEN or Amersham Corp. (3000 Ci/mmol; final specific activity 100-400 Ci/mmol). [α-32P]NAD (1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham. Purified exoenzyme C3 fusion protein containing full-length 24.5-kDa Clostridium botulinum (D strain) C3, expressed in Escherichia coli, was purchased from UBI.PDGF Receptor in Vivo StimulationBalb, Kbalb, and TRMP cells were grown in 10-cm diameter dishes until confluence. They were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% donor calf serum for 24-48 h. Starved cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), at 37°C, then twice with the isotonic wash (120 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM MnCl2, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), at 37°C. For “in vivo” stimulation with PDGF-BB, washed cells were overlaid with 3 ml of isotonic wash buffer at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubator, without or with PDGFhr-BB (R& Systems), to a final concentration of 30 ng/ml for 2 or 5 min at 37°C, as indicated.Cell PermeabilizationThe cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and twice with ice-cold labeling buffer (ICB buffer), containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 140 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM MgCl2, and then permeabilized with 50 μg/ml L-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (Sigma) for 5 min on ice. The cells were then dislodged with a cell scraper and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Under these conditions, 95% of the treated cells were permeable with trypan blue. To remove excess LPC, permeabilized cells were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 15 s in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in the labeling buffer.In Situ Labeling with [α-32P]GTPoxi NucleotidesPermeabilized cells in a final volume of 500 μl of labeling buffer were incubated with 1 μM [α-32P]GTP for 30 min at 37°C, to allow the added guanine nucleotide to bind or to exchange for endogenous nucleotide, after which nucleotides were oxidatively cleaved with 1 mM NaIO4 (Sigma) for 1 min at 37°C. Condensation products were rapidly stabilized by reduction with 20 mM NaCNBH3 (Sigma) for 1 min at 37°C. To remove free reactive GTPoxi nucleotides, cells were treated with 20 mM NaBH4 (Sigma) for 1 min at 37°C, then for 5 min on ice. After centrifugation for 3 min at 6,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, cells were lysed for 20-60 min on ice in lysis buffer HTG (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 5-10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). The lysates were cleared by a 5-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g, at 4°C.Immunoprecipitation and ElectrophoresisFor immunoprecipitation with rabbit antibodies, the lysates were precleared with normal rabbit serum (NRS) previously coupled to protein A- or protein G-Sepharose, as indicated, for 1-12 h at 4°C; preclearings were repeated at least three times. Precleared lysates were then immunoprecipitated for periods ranging from 2 h to overnight at 4°C with specific antibodies. Protein-antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for 90 min at 4°C. p21ras immunoprecipitation with anti-p21rasY13-259 was performed by modifications of the method described previously by Downward et al.(34Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Permeabilized and labeled cells were lysed in 600 μl of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation as described above, and supernatant fractions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes with 75 μl of 4 M NaCl, 75 μl of 4% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.4% SDS. Lysates were precleared three times with rat IgG-agarose (Sigma), before the Y13-259 antibody was added. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C. Y13-259-bound p21ras was precipitated with anti-rat IgG-agarose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed up to six times with lysis buffer. 40 μl of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer was added to the washed beads, and they were then heated at 90°C for 5 min. Labeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 15% acrylamide gel, or as indicated. The gels were fixed and dried. Dried gels were autoradiographed using Kodak XAR-5 film, unless otherwise indicated.Two-dimensional Gel ElectrophoresisA combination of isolectric focusing (IEF) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was used to resolve proteins in two dimensions essentially as described(35Jones P.P. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 108: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For IEF, samples were solubilized in 9.3 M urea, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5% Triton X-100, 2% ampholines (80% ampholines at pH 5-7 and 20% ampholines at pH 3-10 (Bio-Rad)). Tube gels for first dimension IEF were 11-12 cm long, with 1.5-mm internal diameter. As internal markers for two-dimensional electrophoresis, a mixture of four proteins (pI range: 3.8-7.6, in a range of 17-89 kDa) (Sigma) was added. IEF gels were prerun for 15 min at 200 V, 30 min at 300 V, and 30 min at 400 V. Samples were run for 15-17 h at 800 V, followed by 1 h at 1000 V. The pH gradient after electrophoresis ranged from 4.5 to 6.5. For the second dimension, a 15% SDS-PAGE was used.Immunoblot AnalysisGTPoxi-labeled small G-protein-antibodies complex immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer, separated on a 5-15% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Hoeffer Scientific, CA), in a continuous buffer system (39 mM glycine, 48 mM Tris, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol), for 1 h at a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2, unless otherwise indicated. Filters were blocked for 2 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C, with 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Filters were incubated with a mouse mAb against phosphotyrosine residues, 4G10 (IgG2b; UBI). As a secondary antibody, a biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories) was used, and the immunoblot was developed with an ABC amplification kit (Vector), coupled to alkaline phosphatase, following the manufacturer's protocol. A 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate premixed solution was used (Sigma).Proteolytic Cleavage AnalysisSmall G-protein immunoprecipitates derived from GTPoxi-labeled Balb cells were washed up to six times with lysis buffer as described above. They were desalted by washing twice with distilled water and resuspended in 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH 4.4) and treated with 3-5 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoproteinase Glu-C (Promega) for 20 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 40 μl of 3 X sample buffer (4% SDS, 12% glycerol, 50 mM Tris, 2%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Serva Blue)(36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar), and incubating for 30 min at 40°C. Labeled peptides resulting from cleavage were separated electrophoretically using a high resolution Tris-Tricine buffer SDS-PAGE system (16.5% T, 3% C, containing glycerol)(36Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). The gels were either fixed for 1 h in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and dried, or transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF membranes in a continuous buffer system without SDS (25 mM Tris, pH 8, 192 mM glycine, in 20% methanol)(37Patterson S.D. Hess D. Yungwirth T. Aebersold R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Dried gels and filters were analyzed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) or in a InstantImager (Packard), respectively. In addition gels and filters were exposed to Kodak-XAR film or Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham).Cellular Membrane PreparationBalb fibroblasts were grown and rendered quiescent as described above. After PDGF-BB in vivo stimulation, cells were washed twice in cold PBS, scraped from plates, and centrifuged at 1800 × g at 4°C for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 1.0 ml of ice-cold TMSDE buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 75 mM sucrose, 6 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin added prior to use) and incubated at 0°C for 10 min. To disrupt the cells, they were frozen at −70°C and then thawed. Broken cells were homogenized by shearing through a 27-gauge needle with a tuberculin syringe, 8-10 times, on ice. The particulate suspension was centrifuged in a Sorvall Superspeed centifuge at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min, and the pellet containing membranes was then resuspended in 0.1-0.2 ml of TMSDE supplemented with protease inhibitors(38Cui Z. Zubiaur M. Bloch D.B. Michel T. Seidman J.G. Neer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20276-20282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was quantitated using the Bio-Rad assay standardized against a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Membranes were stored at −70°C until use.[32P]NAD-ribosylation of Balb Cell Membrane Proteins[32P]ADP-ribosylation of Balb cell membranes (80-200 μg of protein) by botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase was performed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM thymidine, 0.2% Triton X-100, [32P]NAD (1 μCi/tube), and 6-7 μg/ml purified recombinant C3 exoenzyme, in a total volume of 80-200 μl, for 60 min at 37°C(39Wieland T. Ulibarri I. Aktories K. Gierschik P. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Reaction was terminated by addition of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. In other cases, the reaction was terminated by addition of 900 μl of HTG lysis buffer. In this case, the membranes were incubated for 60 min at 4°C. The lysates were cleared by a 5-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4°C prior to the immunoprecipitation, as described above. Proteins were resolved in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel; the gel was transferred to Immobilon-PVDF following the procedure described above. The radioactivity in the gels and filters were quantified in an InstantImager (Packard). Dried gels and filters were autoradiographed using Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham).RESULTSAffinity Labeling of GTP-binding Proteins in Permeabilized Balb CellsTo identify potential GTP-binding proteins involved in signal transduction through the PDGF receptor, a recently developed technique for labeling of nucleotide binding proteins was utilized. This technique involves the introduction of [α-32P]GTP into permeabilized cells, followed by “in situ” periodate oxidation(30Peter M.E. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 23: 461-466Google Scholar, 31Peter M.E. Hall C. Ruhlmann A. Sancho J. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This method has recently established that the T cell receptor ξ chain has the capacity to bind GTP and GDP(31Peter M.E. Hall C. Ruhlmann A. Sancho J. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This technique permits specific labeling of such different types of G-proteins as the α-subunits of the heterotrimeric Gs and Gi-2 proteins, as well as small G-proteins such as p21ras protein(27Peter M.E. She J. Huber L.A. Terhorst C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the present study, this technique was used to label GTP-binding proteins in Balb cells and Balb cells expressing activated (v-Ki)-p21ras. Confluent cells were serum-starved and in vivo stimulated with 30 ng/ml PDGF-BBhr for 5 min at 37°C or left untreated. The cells were then permeabilized with 50 μg/ml LPC for 5 min on ice. The cells were scraped from the plates into microcentrifuge tubes, where they were GTPoxi-labeled after incubation with 1 μM [α-32P]GTP for 30 min at 37°C. Using this in situ cross-linking method, we were able to selectively label several G-proteins in the range of 21-27 kDa with [α-32P]GTPoxi, as seen in whole lysates of Balb or v-ras-expressing Balb cells, resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1A).To evaluate the specificity of the in situ labeling technique, competition experiments were carried out using unoxidizable deoxyribonucleotides. TRMP cells transfected with the human PDGF type-β receptor gene were used(33Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Cross-linking with [α-32P]GTPoxi in permeabilized TRMP cells was completely abolished in the presence of 100 μM cold dGTP or 100 μM cold dGDP, whereas addition of cold dATP or dCTP did not affect labeling (Fig. 1B). Thus, the observed 21-27-kDa GTPoxi-labeled bands were the result of a specific affinity labeling, and only those proteins that bound guanine nucleotides were labeled (Fig. 1B).To demonstrate that known low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins could be specifically labeled in Balb fibroblasts with this in situ [α-32P]GTPoxi-labeling method, Balb cells were stimulated with PDGF-BB for 2 min at 37°C and then permeabilized and labeled as described above (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates were precleared up to three times with NRS coupled to protein G-Sepharose (lane1). The precleared lysates were independently immunoprecipitated with one of several different specific anti-small G-protein antibodies. Lanes 3-5 show the immunoprecipitation of GTPoxi-labeled RhoA, RhoB, and Rap1A/B, precipitated with affinity-purified anti-RhoA, anti-RhoB, and anti-Rap1A/B, respectively. The GTPoxi-labeled p21ras protein was immunoprecipitated from Balb cells with mAb Y13-259 (lane6). Immunoprecipitated [α-32P]GTPoxi-labeled proteins migrated in a slightly retarded fashion during SDS-PAGE separation, due to the cross-linking, presenting apparent molecular masses greater than 21 kDa.Figure 2:Identification of known small GTP-binding proteins labeled with [α-32P]GTPoxi. A, Balb cells were stimulated with PDGF-BBhr for 2 min at 37°C, permeabilized and labeled with [α-32P]GTPoxi as described in Fig. 1. The lysates were precleared with NRS-protein G-Sepharose (lane1) and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for small G-proteins: affinity-purified anti-RhoA (lane3), affinity-purified anti-RhoB (lane4), affinity-purified anti-Rap1A/B (lane5), and anti-p21 mAb Y13-259 (lane6). Lane2 shows a small G-protein co-immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-PDGF type-β receptor antibody. B, anti-RhoA-specific immunoprecipitation of TRMP cell lysates labeled with [α-32P]GTPoxi, without (lane1) or with (lanes 2-4) 100 μM competing cold deoxynucleotides. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in a 15% SDS-PAGE after elution from the Sepharose. An autoradiogram of the dried gel is shown here. The position of molecular mass markers is indicated to the left of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further document the specificity of the labeling method for known small G-proteins, the RhoA small G-protein was labeled in the presence or absence of competing deoxynucleotides, and immunoprecipitated by anti-RhoA antiserum. Labeling of RhoA in TRMP cells (Fig. 2B, lane 1) was completely abrogated by the addition of 100 μM cold dGDP (lane2) or 100 μM"
https://openalex.org/W1981224517,"Adenovirus vector-mediated transfer of the receptor-associated protein (RAP) gene into low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient mice was shown to achieve plasma concentrations ranging between 20 and 200 μg/ml and to result in the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins (Willnow, T. E., Sheng, Z., Ishibashi, S., and Herz, J.(1994) Science 264, 1471-1474). Both this finding and the observation that in addition to various other members of the LDL receptor gene family, RAP binds to a yet unidentified protein of apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa prompted us to examine the effect of high concentrations of RAP on the lipolysis-stimulated receptor (LSR). LSR is a receptor distinct from the LDL receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein and is capable of binding apoB and apoE when activated by free fatty acids. Data reported here show that in fibroblasts isolated from a subject homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia, RAP fusion protein inhibited LSR-mediated binding of 125I-LDL and the subsequent internalization and degradation of the particles. Studies on the interaction of RAP with LSR in isolated rat liver membranes revealed that at concentrations ≥10 μg/ml, RAP inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the binding of LDL to LSR; half-maximum inhibition was obtained with 20 μg/ml RAP. Ligand blotting studies revealed that RAP bound directly to two rat liver membrane proteins of apparent molecular masses identical to those that bind 125I-LDL after preincubation with oleate. However, unlike LDL, binding of 125I-RAP to LSR did not require preincubation with oleate. Preincubation of nitrocellulose membranes with an excess of unlabeled RAP fusion protein decreased oleate-induced binding of 125I-LDL to LSR candidate proteins, whereas preincubation with excess unlabeled LDL was unable to prevent the subsequent binding of 125I-RAP to the LSR proteins. Both the latter data and analysis of the mechanism of inhibition were consistent with the RAP inhibitory effect on LSR being achieved by interference with a site distinct from the oleate-induced LDL binding site. In conclusion, this study shows that at concentrations reported to delay chylomicron remnant removal in LDL receptor-deficient mice, RAP exerted a significant inhibitory effect on LSR.

https://openalex.org/W2062261894,"The role of cysteine 266 in human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase, a residue that is homologous to a cysteine mapped to the active site of prokaryotic HMG-CoA lyase by protein chemistry approaches, has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Both the wild-type human enzyme and a C323S variant, in which a regulatory sulfhydryl has been eliminated without any negative effect on catalytic activity (Roberts, J. R., Narasimhan, C., Hruz, P. W., Mitchell, G. A., and Miziorko, H. M.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 17841-17846), were used as models. Mutant enzymes C266A, C266A/C323S, C266S, and C266S/C323S were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. In all cases, kinetic characterization indicated that the Km value for HMG-CoA was not substantially different from the value measured using wild-type human lyase, suggesting that no serious structural perturbation occurs upon replacing Cys-266. A dissociable divalent cation (Mn2+ or Mg2+), which is required for activity in both native and C323S enzymes, is also an essential component for activity in each of the Cys-266 mutants. The structural integrity of the human mutants was further indicated by Mn2+ binding studies, which demonstrate similarities not only in the activator cation binding stoichiometries, but also in the KD values for Mn2+ as determined for wild-type and mutant C266A or C266S proteins. Purified C266A and C266A/C323S mutants both displayed ≈1.3 × 104-fold diminution in specific activity, while the kcat value was diminished in both C266S and C266S/C323S by ≈9.9 × 102-fold. This large diminution in catalytic efficiency in enzyme variants that display no substantial structural perturbations is in accord with an active-site assignment to Cys-266 and qualifies its sulfhydryl group for consideration as a component of the catalytic apparatus.

This reaction accounts for the formation of ketone bodies, an alternate source of fuel during times of fasting or starvation(1Robinson A.M. Williamson D.H. Physiol.

Two reactive cysteines have been identified on the basis of mechanistic and protein chemistry studies on HMG-CoA lyases. Work with the avian enzyme indirectly implicated a cysteine in in vitro regulation of the activity of eukaryotic HMG-CoA lyase by controlling the thiol/disulfide state of the enzyme(8Hruz P.W. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A hyperreactive cysteine was mapped to the C-terminal region of the avian protein and was found to be capable of forming an intersubunit cross-link with the corresponding cysteine on the other subunit of this dimeric enzyme(8Hruz P.W. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This cysteine is conserved in both human and mouse HMG-CoA lyases, but not in the bacterial enzyme. Interestingly, the activity of the bacterial enzyme is not highly dependent on thiol-reducing reagents, as are the eukaryotic counterparts(9Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11224-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of this reactive cysteine (C323S)2 2The numbering convention designates as residue 1 the first residue in the precursor form of this mitochondrial matrix enzyme. 2The numbering convention designates as residue 1 the first residue in the precursor form of this mitochondrial matrix enzyme. in the human enzyme did not impair catalytic function, but led to a complete loss of the enzyme's ability to form an intersubunit cross-link and to substantial diminution in the requirement for thiol reagents to maintain activity(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second reactive cysteine has been mapped to the active site. Utilizing both bacterial and avian lyases, Hruz et al.(11Hruz P.W. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) established that the substrate analog 2-butynoyl-CoA stoichiometrically modifies the enzyme. Protein chemistry studies on the modified prokaryotic protein established Cys-237 as the target. Alignment of the available amino acid sequences for HMG-CoA lyases suggests that the labeled cysteine corresponds to Cys-266 of the human enzyme. Recently, a recombinant system for expression and isolation of human HMG-CoA lyase was developed(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilizing this system, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to replace, in both wild-type and C323S enzymes, the Cys-266 sulfhydryl group. This report describes our strategy for evaluating the structural integrity of the isolated mutant proteins, which is a prerequisite to any meaningful interpretation of the results of the accompanying kinetic characterization. The results represent a significant confirmation of the active-site assignment prompted by the original affinity labeling studies and implicate human lyase Cys-266 in the chemistry of HMG-CoA cleavage. [14C]Acetic anhydride was purchased from DuPont NEN. Q-Sepharose anion-exchange resin and Superose-12 (preparatory grade) resin were products of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Phenyl-agarose was purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were a product of New England Biolabs Inc. Qiaex and Qiagen were purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). HMG-CoA was synthesized from the anhydride, prepared from the free acid (Fluka) according to Goldfarb and Pitot (12Goldfarb S. Pitot H.C. J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12: 512-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were reagent-grade. Radiolabeled HMG-CoA was enzymatically synthesized (13Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from acetoacetyl-CoA and radiolabeled [1-14C]acetyl-CoA(14Simon E.J. Shemin D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2520Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The product (6000 dpm/nmol) was purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography and isolated in a salt-free form using a Sep-Pak reverse-phase cartridge(8Hruz P.W. Miziorko H.M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1144-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Construction of the C266S, C266S/C323S, C266A, and C266A/C323S mutations was performed as follows. Either the pTrcHL-1 or pTrcHL-C323S plasmid (10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI and BamHI, and the resulting ≈925-base pair fragment containing the coding region corresponding to the mature matrix form of the protein was isolated and purified using the Qiaex kit and protocol (QIAGEN Inc.). pTrc99A was digested with NcoI and BamHI; the resulting 4.1-kilobase vector fragment was purified as described above. The 925-base pair fragments, containing either the wild-type coding sequence or C323S, were digested with PstI and AccI, which have unique restriction sites within the coding sequence. The double digestion generated three fragments with sizes of ≈680, 95, and 150 base pairs. The C266S or C266S/C323S and the C266A or C266A/C323S mutations were generated with a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex, spanning the 95-base pair region between the unique PstI and AccI restriction sites. The synthetic cassette was generated by annealing six oligonucleotides (three for each strand). The cysteine codon was altered to either serine (TCT) or alanine (GCT). The generation of a viable plasmid encoding the desired mutation at position 266 of the human HMG-CoA lyase gene was then accomplished by a four-way ligation of the following: the appropriate synthetic cassette, the isolated 680-base NcoI/PstI fragment, the isolated 150-base AccI/BamHI fragment, and the 4.1-kilobase fragment isolated from the NcoI/BamHI-digested pTrc99A plasmid. The resulting expression vectors, pTrcHL-C266S, pTrcHL-C266S/C323S, pTrcHL-C266A, and pTrcHL-C266A/C323S, were sequenced in both directions (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) to confirm that only the appropriate mutations were encoded in the region where the synthetic cassette replaces the wild-type sequence. Recombinant wild-type human lyase, C323S lyase, and the C266A, C266S, C266A/C323S, and C266S/C323S variants were expressed and purified as described by Roberts et al.(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All mutants purified identically to the wild-type enzyme. The isolated enzymes were >95% pure. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) utilizing an 11% acrylamide running gel and a 4.5% acrylamide stacking gel. Enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA lyase and the engineered variants was determined using the citrate synthase-coupled assay of Stegink and Coon (18Stegink L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5272-5279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Kramer and Miziorko (19Kramer P.R. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 100 μM HMG-CoA was used to initiate the reaction. When the Ka value of Mn2+ was determined, all components of the assay mixture, including buffers, were treated with Chelex 100 to remove trace metals. The pH/rate profiles for wild-type and C323S lyases were measured as follows. Enzyme was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of 20 mM dithiothreitol and then placed on ice until needed. After addition of the reduced lyase to the assay mixture, the reaction was immediately initiated with HMG-CoA, thus minimizing any instability related to changes in pH. The buffer employed in the assay mixture was either 100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.10 mM EDTA for pH values between 6.6 and 8.9 or 100 mM glycine, 0.10 mM EDTA for pH values between 8.7 and 10.0. The Vmax value for HMG-CoA lyase was determined at the specified pH values by linear regression analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk plots. The pH/rate profile data were fit using a nonlinear regression analysis algorithm(20Marquardt D.W. SIAM J. Appl. Math. 1963; 2: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). The pH dependence of C266A/C323S lyase was measured using a radioactive assay (21Clinkenbeard K.D. Reed W.D. Mooney R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3108-3116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in order to improve sensitivity. The reaction mixture contained the appropriate buffer (specified above), 10 mM MgCl2, HMG-CoA lyase (8.2 μg of C266A/C323S) preincubated with 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 μM [14C]HMG-CoA in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzymatically synthesized [14C]HMG-CoA (6000 dpm/nmol) at 30°C. At various time points, aliquots were removed and acidified with 6 N HCl. After heating to dryness, the acid-stable radioactivity attributable to [14C]HMG from unreacted substrate was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Depletion of acid-stable radioactivity is a measure of enzymatic cleavage of substrate to form acid-volatile product (acetoacetate). The radioactive assay, under standard pH conditions (Tris-HCl, pH 8.2), was also utilized to confirm the activity of the wild-type, C323S, C266A, C266S, and C266S/C323S enzymes. Measurement of Mn2+ binding to human HMG-CoA lyase by ESR was performed as follows. X-band ESR spectra were recorded using a Varian Century-Line 9-GHz spectrometer with a TE102 cavity at 22°C and a modulation amplitude of 10 G, modulation frequency of 100 KHz, and microwave power of 60 milliwatts. The field sweep was 1000 G, and the time constant was 0.25 s. A quartz microflat cell was used for all measurements. Human lyase samples in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1.0 mM dithiothreitol were concentrated to 100-150 μM (calculated on the basis of a 34-kDa subunit) using Amicon Centriflo membrane cones. Glycerol was removed from the samples prior to ESR experiments using Sephadex G-50 centrifugal columns(22Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ESR samples contained variable concentrations of Mn2+ (25-182 μM) with either 100 μM (wild-type) or 68 μM (mutant) HMG-CoA lyase sites. Mn2+ bound to HMG-CoA lyase was calculated by comparing the amplitudes of the sample spectra with the corresponding amplitudes observed with a solution containing an equal concentration of Mn2+ in buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.8). The data were subjected to Scatchard analysis; data plots were fit using linear regression analysis. Hruz et al.(11Hruz P.W. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were able to identify Cys-237 of the bacterial enzyme as a residue potentially important for catalysis. The stoichiometry of the affinity label 2-butynoyl-CoA bound to the recombinant human enzyme (1.0 per subunit(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) paralleled the results determined for both the bacterial and avian lyases (0.9 and 0.8 per subunit(11Hruz P.W. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). These observations are most simply explained by the existence of an equivalent target in all three enzymes. Sequence homology suggests that Cys-266 of the human lyase corresponds to Cys-237 of the bacterial enzyme (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Additional rationale for testing the function of a cysteine within the substrate-binding site stems from the pH dependence of the HMG-CoA lyase reaction that has been reported for purified avian liver lyase (19Kramer P.R. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the partially purified bovine liver (18Stegink L.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5272-5279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial (23Scher D.S. Rodwell V.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1003: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) enzymes. In all cases, the pH optimum is distinctly alkaline, but no pKa estimates were offered in those earlier reports nor were details provided to indicate how closely the activity estimates approximate Vmax. The pH dependence of Vmax for both C323S (Fig. 1A) and wild-type (data not shown) human HMG-CoA lyases was found to be identical. The curve shown fit to the data was calculated for ionization of a single group with a pKa value of 7.99 ± 0.06. Such observations for C323S lyase eliminate any possibility that the regulatory sulfhydryl group of Cys-323 is responsible for the observed pH profile. However, it remains possible that the observed pH dependence reflects the requirement to form a thiolate anion from a different cysteine located in the active site. The utility of a bacterial expression system for production of recombinant human HMG-CoA lyase has already been demonstrated in mutagenesis work that produced an active, oxidation-resistant C323S lyase variant(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that Cys-266 plays an important role in catalysis, the Cys-266 sulfhydryl was eliminated by synthetic oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis. Substitutions were engineered in both pTrcHL-1 and pTrcHL-C323S expression plasmids. The conservative substitutions correspond to replacement of the cysteine sulfhydryl with either a serine hydroxyl (C266S, C266S/C323S) or the C-3 proton of an alanine (C266A, C266A/C323S). Utilizing the purification system developed earlier for human HMG-CoA lyase(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), each of the Cys-266 mutant constructs was expressed and purified. All Cys-266 variants of HMG-CoA lyase were found in the soluble bacterial extracts at levels similar to those observed upon expression of both wild-type and C323S enzymes. Each mutant lyase purified identically to the wild-type enzyme; the elution profiles for the anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatographic steps for each of the Cys-266 constructs were identical to those observed with the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the overall conformation of each mutant is not drastically altered. Each variant was purified to homogeneity, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The apparent subunit molecular weight (Mr = 34,000) was identical to that observed for both wild-type and C323S enzymes. The specific activity of the purified Cys-266 mutants is summarized in Table 2. The serine-containing variants (C266S and C266S/C323S) exhibited 700-1300-fold diminution in activity. In the case of the alanine mutants (C266A and C266A/C323S), the diminution in activity in comparison with wild-type (or C323S) lyase was even more prominent, with a net effect of >104-fold. In contrast to the 3-4 orders of magnitude difference in catalytic efficiency between the serine or alanine mutants and the wild-type enzyme, substantial differences in Km values for HMG-CoA were not apparent (Table 2), suggesting that the active site is not grossly altered when Cys-266 is replaced.TABLE II Open table in a new tab The pH dependence of the C266A/C323S variant, which exhibits the greatest diminution in catalytic function, was measured utilizing the radioactive [14C]HMG-CoA depletion assay. Qualitatively, the data (Fig. 1B) indicate an increase in rate as pH rises from values of ≈8 to ≈10. Despite the increased sensitivity of this assay, signal-to-noise considerations (at lower radioactive substrate levels) precluded a full substrate concentration dependence study at pH <8.2. In such cases, the observed rate was unchanged when measured at several elevated substrate levels, suggesting that these rate estimates approach Vmax. The data for this mutant enzyme could not be satisfactorily fit to a single ionization curve by the algorithm used to generate the theoretical fit shown in Fig. 1A for the catalytically functional C323S lyase. Interpretation is complicated by the fact that, at low pH, no deviation from the linear relationship between V and pH could be detected before activity diminished to levels where signal-to-noise limitations precluded meaningful rate estimates. At elevated pH, activity increased linearly with pH increment until further estimates were precluded by enzyme denaturation due to alkalinity of the assay mixture. To test whether the marked diminution in catalytic activity observed for Cys-266 mutants may be the consequence of a structure that is seriously perturbed in comparison with that of active wild-type or C323S HMG-CoA lyase, biophysical characterization of these mutants was performed. CD spectroscopy (data not shown) did not reveal significant differences between catalytically active wild-type or C323S lyase and the Cys-266 mutant proteins, suggesting that secondary structure is not substantially different in these proteins. However, it remained possible that more subtle perturbations than can be detected by this optical spectroscopy approach could account for the observed diminution in activity. This concern prompted development of a more refined approach to test this issue. Activities of wild-type and C323S human lyases(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), avian lyase(24Hruz P.W. Anderson V.E. Miziorko H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and bacterial lyase (9Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11224-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) are all markedly stimulated by divalent cations. The activity of each Cys-266 variant was also found to be dependent on the presence of a divalent cation. Wild-type and C323S human lyases exhibit Km values for Mg2+ that are ∼100-fold weaker than reported for the Kmvalues for Mn2+(10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the cation concentration dependence data, measured under conditions of saturating HMG-CoA, are extrapolated for estimation of Vmax, equivalent values are observed using either Mg2+ or Mn2+, underscoring the efficacy of Mn2+ as an activator of the human enzyme. The observation that Mn2+, which is spectroscopically active due to its five unpaired d electrons, binds with such high affinity in comparison with the spectroscopically silent cation Mg2+ suggested the utility of this cation as a structural probe for the enzyme and its variants. For this reason, the binding of manganese to the enzyme was investigated by both kinetic and ESR spectroscopic methods. The Km value previously reported (10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for Mn2+ (0.34 μM) was determined under saturating HMG-CoA conditions. To determine the activator constant (Ka) for Mn2+, the activity of HMG-CoA lyase was determined using variable concentrations of both Mn2+ and HMG-CoA; Fig. 2 shows a double-reciprocal plot of these data. Based on the intersection point of the lines(25Mildvan A.S. Cohn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 238-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an activator constant, which represents an estimate of an equilibrium dissociation constant (26Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1958: 456-466Google Scholar) for the binary Mn2+-lyase complex, was calculated for human HMG-CoA lyase (Ka = 0.5 μM). The binding of activator Mn2+ to human HMG-CoA lyase was directly measured by ESR spectroscopy. Before conducting these measurements, the stability of HMG-CoA lyase in the absence of glycerol had to be determined. The viscosity that results from inclusion of a significant concentration of glycerol in the sample can lead to broadening of the Mn2+ signal, complicating interpretation of the resulting data. This constraint seemed potentially serious since bacterial HMG-CoA lyase loses activity rapidly in the absence of glycerol(9Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11224-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To evaluate the consequences for the human enzyme, glycerol was rapidly removed from both the wild-type and C323S lyases by centrifugal gel filtration. Both glycerol-free samples were incubated at 4°C, and the activity was periodically measured under standard assay conditions. The half-life of the wild-type enzyme was determined to be >12 h, which is sufficient for execution of extensive ESR experiments prior to any significant decrease in activity. Unfortunately, the half-life of C323S was <4 h. In this respect, C323S human lyase was very similar to bacterial HMG-CoA lyase, which also lacks the C-terminal region cysteine residue. Since the C323S variants were not stable for extended periods of time after the removal of glycerol, the Mn2+ ESR experiments were performed with either the wild-type enzyme or the Cys-266 mutants that, like wild-type lyase, contained Cys-323. The spectrum of free Mn2+ (90 μM) is shown as the larger amplitude trace in the inset of Fig. 3. When wild-type HMG-CoA lyase (100 μM sites) was added, the free Mn2+ was diminished upon binding of this activator cation by the enzyme, and the amplitude of the signal was correspondingly decreased (Fig. 3, inset). By comparing the peak-to-peak amplitudes of corresponding lines of Mn2+ spectra measured in the absence and presence of lyase, the amount of bound manganese was determined. While signal-to-noise considerations limit accurate measurements to mixtures with total Mn2+ >25 μM, the data are adequate for Scatchard analysis (Fig. 3), which provides a good estimate of the binding stoichiometry (n = 0.7). Linear regression analysis of the data also provides a reasonable slope estimate, used for calculation of a dissociation constant (KD = 1.5 μM) for the binary E•M complex (Table 2). The KD value determined by these physical measurements is in good agreement with the kinetically determined activator constant (Ka = 0.5 μM). When similar experiments were performed using C266S and C266A enzymes, Scatchard analyses indicated KD values of 7.9 and 22.6 μM, respectively (Table 2). While these values indicate slightly weaker binding than measured with wild-type lyase, differences are modest in comparison with the observed contrasts in catalytic efficiency. Significantly, the stoichiometry of activator Mn2+ binding, which can be well determined in the samples due to the high Mn2+ site occupancy, is comparable for both the wild-type enzyme and the Cys-266 variants (Table 2), indicating that these mutants possess a full complement of functional binding sites. Therefore, these data confirm that the active-site structure of the Cys-266 variants is not grossly altered by the conservative substitution of serine or alanine. Engineering mutations into HMG-CoA lyase has proven informative in the context of evaluating regulatory (10Roberts J.R. Narasimhan C. Hruz P.W. Mitchell G.A. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17841-17846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and catalytic (this report) regions within the enzyme. Such an approach may also prove useful as we model the point mutations associated with defects in this protein that produce hydroxymethylglutaric aciduria in humans. For this reason, attempts were made to develop methods useful for evaluation of the structural integrity of mutant human HMG-CoA lyase proteins. Previous work with both bacterial HMG-CoA lyase (27Narasimhan C. Antholine W.E. Miziorko H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and avian HMG-CoA synthase (13Misra I. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12129-12135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has demonstrated the spin-labeled substrate analog R•CoA (carboxy-PROXYL-CoA(28Weidman S.W. Drysdale G. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1874-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) to be a useful probe in ESR characterization of wild-type and mutant forms of these enzymes. This analog not only proves to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to acyl-CoA substrate, but also can be shown by physical measurements to bind to the active site of both enzymes with KDvalues comparable to the kinetically determined Kiestimates. When the utility of this spin probe was evaluated using human HMG-CoA lyase, inhibition (Ki > 500 μM) was observed at levels of R•CoA that are severalfold higher than used with the bacterial lyase (Ki = 98 μM), and therefore, this analog is unattractive for ESR spectroscopy studies. Differences between bacterial and human enzymes with respect to R•CoA binding are not surprising since binding of 2-butynoyl-CoA to the avian enzyme was 5-fold weaker than to the bacterial enzyme(11Hruz P.W. Narasimhan C. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, the dissociable divalent cation activator was considered for use as a physical probe. While the constraint that ESR measurements of Mn2+ binding required elimination of glycerol from the enzyme buffer restricted such measurements to wild-type, C266S, and C266A lyases, the value of Mn2+ as a structural probe has been amply demonstrated. The observation that the mutant lyases possess a full complement of high affinity binding sites for activator cation represents a stringent criterion of structural integrity that complements secondary structure comparisons. An additional benefit of the ESR approach to quantitate cation affinity involves the consequent refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of cation activation of HMG-CoA cleavage. Demonstration by the biophysical approach that a binary Mn2+-enzyme complex forms with a KDvalue comparable to the kinetically determined Kavalue argues that lyase functions as a metal-enzyme complex. This direct measurement allows us to refine earlier speculation, based on indirect kinetic data generated using an alternative substrate(24Hruz P.W. Anderson V.E. Miziorko H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), by now suggesting that formation of a binary enzyme-cation species is a prelude to production of a catalytically active ternary enzyme-substrate-metal complex. Finally, the marked diminution in catalytic activity that coincides with replacement of the Cys-266 sulfhydryl in the otherwise structurally intact HMG-CoA lyase mutants invites comment. The enzyme catalyzes a typical Claisen cleavage. Hanson and Rose (29Hanson K.R. Rose I.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 1-10Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) have proposed that enzymatic reactions of this type involve general acid and general base catalysts oriented on opposite sides of the substrate. The pH/rate profile for wild-type human lyase is compatible with the hypothesis that deprotonation of an amino acid side chain exhibiting a pKa value of ≈8.0 coincides with formation of a catalytically functional enzyme. Is it plausible that the data reflect ionization of Cys-266 and that this residue functions as the general base? Replacement of the Cys-266 sulfhydryl with a higher pKa serine hydroxyl lowers activity by 3 orders of magnitude. The effect increases to 4 orders of magnitude in the C266A and C266A/C323S mutants, which is compatible with the elimination of any nucleophile at this position. The magnitude of these effects precludes performing rate measurements at pH ≤7 just as alkaline lability of the protein precludes measurements at pH ≥10. With these constraints, it is unclear whether the increase in rate for C266A as pH rises reflects titration of an amino acid side chain other than the Cys-266 sulfhydryl or whether specific base catalysis by solvent-derived hydroxyl ion accounts for the effect. In the related lyase reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli phospho-2-keto-3-deoxyheptulonate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.15; 3-deoxyarabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase), mutagenic replacement of the Cys-61 sulfhydryl resulted in diminution of activity by ∼104-fold(30Stephens C.M.

The cysteine residue was viewed as critical to catalysis, but was assigned a role in metal binding. In the case of rabbit muscle fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC 4.1.2.13), a more exaggerated effect (106-fold diminution in activity) results when the ∊-amino group of Lys-146 is eliminated(31Morris A.J. Tolan D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12291-12297Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Only a 103-fold drop in activity is observed when histidine is substituted for lysine at this position. Potential roles proposed for this lysine include stabilization of a carbanionic reaction intermediate, electrostatic interaction with an acidic active-site residue to enhance that residue's function as a catalytic base, and a direct general base function for lysine's ∊-amino group in accepting a proton from the substrate's C-4 hydroxyl group. This latter possibility would appear analogous to the requirement for a general base to accept a proton from the C-3 hydroxyl of the substrate in the HMG-CoA lyase reaction. The retention of measurable activity in the Cys-266 HMG-CoA lyase mutants suggests that an unambiguous assignment of this residue as a catalytic base cannot yet be made. As in the case of aldolase, an alternative role in enhancing the reactivity of another active-site amino acid that participates more directly in reaction chemistry remains to be excluded. Nonetheless, the 104-fold effect observed upon eliminating the Cys-266 sulfhydryl of HMG-CoA lyase certainly qualifies Cys-266 as a catalytic residue, validating the active-site assignment made on the basis of protein chemistry studies(11Hruz P.W.

The allosteric cooperativity of these multisubunit enzymes presumably requires numerous protein-protein interactions within the enzyme complex. To correlate known in vitro changes in subunit structure with in vivo allosteric interactions, we introduced the beta subunit of spinach chloroplast coupling factor 1 ATP into a bacterial F1 ATP synthase. A cloned atpB gene, encoding the complete chloroplast beta subunit, complemented a chromosomal deletion of the cognate uncD gene in Escherichia coli and was incorporated into a functional hybrid F1 ATP synthase. The cysteine residue at position 63 in chloroplast beta is known to be located at the interface between alpha and beta subunits and to be conformationally coupled, in vitro, to the nucleotide binding site > 40 A away. Enlarging the side chain of chloroplast coupling factor 1 beta residue 63 from Cys to Trp blocked ATP synthesis in vivo without significantly impairing ATPase activity or ADP binding in vitro. The in vivo coupling of nucleotide binding at catalytic sites to transmembrane proton movement may thus involve an interaction, via conformational changes, between the amino-terminal domains of the alpha and beta subunits."

In both human and mice, the gene encoding PBG-D posseses two promoters, lying in close proximity(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol.

Differential splicing of transcripts initiated at each individual promoter yields two distinct mRNA species which give rise to two isoforms of the protein. One isoform is ubiquitous, whereas the other is erythroid-specific. We have previously analyzed some of the regulatory elements that contribute to the tissue-specific promoter utilization of the mouse PBG-D gene. Six DNase-I hypersensitive (DHS) sites were identified in DNA from erythroid and nonerythroid cells(3Porcher C. Pitiot G. Plumb M. Lowe S. de Verneuil H. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10562-10569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The three most upstream sites (DHS A, B, and C) are present in all tissue types, while the three downstream sites are either exclusively detected (DHS E) or more pronounced (DHS D and F) in erythroid cells (see Fig. 1 for position of the DHS). DHS B corresponds to the ubiquitous promoter region which does not possess a TATA box or CAAT box, but two SP1-binding sites(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an usual feature for gene promoters expressed in all cell types in a constitutive manner(4Dynan W.S. Trends Genet. 1983; 2: 196-197Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (372) Google Scholar). DHS E is located near the erythroid start site. Two cis-acting sequences were found in the erythroid promoter, namely a GATA-1-binding site situated downstream of a duplicated CACC motif. GATA-1 is a major element of erythroid differentiation, as experiments involving the disruption of the GATA-1 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells have shown(5Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E.

Staub A. Chambon P. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), as well as the erythroid-specific Krüppel-like factor(8Mantovani R. Malgaretti N. Nicolis S. Giglioni B.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). DHS C, which maps to the first exon-intron boundary, is situated within the region where a block to elongation of ubiquitous transcripts has been characterized(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, DHS D, which is localized 1 kb upstream of the erythroid transcription start site, consists of two inverted repeats of the GATA-1-binding site. Functional analysis of the erythroid PBG-D gene activity, using a reporter gene in stable transfection experiments, showed that combination of at least one of the two CACC elements and of the GATA-1 site was sufficient to promote a basal and tissue-specific expression of the PBG-D gene(3Porcher C. Pitiot G. Plumb M. Lowe S. de Verneuil H. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10562-10569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies did not permit comparison of the expression level of the reporter gene with that of the endogenous PBG-D gene, and variability in the expression levels of some of the constructs suggested that the integration site in the host cells may have lead to position effects. In the present study, and in order to define all the elements necessary for a high level of expression and integration site independence, we examined the pattern and the level of expression initiated at the two promoters following integration of a whole PBG-D gene into a host genome. A DNA fragment containing the entire gene with 2.5 kb of 5′- and 2.5 kb of 3′-flanking regions was used to produce transgenic mice and the same sequences were stably transfected into mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, a cell line in which both promoters of the gene are active. To accurately assess the transgene copy number and the relative level of expression from each individual promoter, we used a quantitative PCR assay as described previously(10Porcher C. Malinge M.C. Picat C. Grandchamp B. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). The longest construct contained sufficient regulatory elements to confer a pattern of expression similar to that of the endogenous gene in both transgenic mice and in transfected cells. A series of deletional mutant constructs was then used to characterize the contribution of the previously identified DHS (B-E, Fig. 1) to the regulation of the PBG-D gene expression.

The organization of the mouse PBG-D gene, together with a partial restriction map, and the location of all oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Fig. 1. A 12.5-kb fragment of mouse genomic DNA, isolated from a previously described cosmid(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into pGEM 4Z (Promega). This fragment consisted of the entire PBG-D gene (7.5 kb) flanked by 2.5 kb of 5′ and 2.5 kb of 3′ sequences. This initial construct contained the DNA regions corresponding to DHS B to F and was named pBCDEF. Two modifications were subsequently introduced into this construct that modified either exon 2 by insertion of a 5-mer oligonucleotide (GATCC) into the unique BamHI restriction site, or exon 3 by addition of six nucleotides (AAGCTT). The latter modification was introduced as follows: two partially overlapping fragments were synthesized by PCR using primers E2S/E3HdAS and E3HdS/E4HS and the initial construct as template. After purification, these two products were mixed, denatured, and reamplified using primers E2S/E4HS (see Fig. 1 for position of the oligonucleotides). The final product was then digested with BamHI and SpeI and ligated to the corresponding sites in the initial construct. Different constructs were derived from plasmid pBCDEF, labeled in exon 3, as follows (positions are numbered relative to the erythroid start site): pΔ5′BCDEF, the 5′ end of the initial construct was deleted leaving only 50 bp upstream of the ubiquitous start site; pBDEF, an internal SmaI(−1579)/XhoI (−1450) fragment was deleted; pBCEF, plasmid pBCDEF was digested by HindIII(−1038), then incubated with 2 units of Bal 31 nuclease (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2-25 min. After incubation with the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, plasmids were religated, transformed, then sequenced by the chain termination procedure (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar) in order to determine the extent of the deletions. One of the resulting plasmids had a 59 bp deletion that removed the two GATA-1 motifs. This plamid was named pBCEF and retained for further analysis; pCDEF, DNA sequences situated upstream of the SmaI site(−1579) were deleted; pBCDE, DNA sequences downstream of the HincII site (+6000) situated downstream of the polyadenylation signal were deleted. All the following constructs are derived from pBCDE: pBCE, a XhoI(−1450)/BamHI (+98) fragment (lacking the two GATA-1 motifs) was isolated from plasmid pBCEF and subcloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid pBCDE; pBCD, the GATA-1 motif in the erythroid-specific promoter (−40 from the erythroid start site) was modified by site-directed mutagenesis following the same procedure as that described for introducing the modification into exon 3. The mutation changed the CTTATC motif into CTCACT. The first pair of primers was I1S/GatamAS and GatamS/EIIIK and reamplification was performed using primers I1S/EIIIK. The final product was then digested by HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pBCDE; pE, 5′ sequences upstream of the PstI site(−494) in pBCDE were removed. All modifications introduced by PCR were verified by sequencing. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions are as follows (F = fluorescein): pSE1 sense, ACACCAGGGGACCGCAGCGGACT; I1S sense, CTAGTAGAGACACACCTGAA; E2S sense, F-AGTGTCCTGTTGCTGCTGCC; EIIIK antisense, ACGGGTACCCACTCGAATCA; E4HS antisense, F-GCCAGGGTACAAGGCTTTCA; GATAmS sense, GATGGGCCTCATCATTTT; GatamAS, AAAATGATGAGGCCCATC; E3HdS sense, CAAAGATGAAGCTTAGGGTGATTCGAGTGGGCAC; E3HdAS antisense, CACCCTAAGCTTCATCTTTGAGCCGTTTTCTTCC. DNA to be microinjected was derived from plasmid pBCDEF modified in exon 2. After enzymatic digestion, a 12.5-kb EcoRI fragment was separated from the plasmid sequences by electrophoresis and purified by GeneClean (Bio 101). A few hundred copies of the DNA fragment were injected into one of the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from mating B6D2F1 mice. Surviving eggs were transferred to pseudopregnant females(12Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA from blood (see below). Lines were established, and expression of the transgene was analyzed on F1 or F2 generations. Mouse erythroleukemia cells (clone 745) were grown in suspension in a minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected by electroporation. Briefly, 2 × 107 mid-log growth phase cells were washed, resuspended in 0.8 ml of MEM and mixed to the linearized PBG-D and pMC1neo plasmids (Stratagene), present in a 5:1 molar ratio, respectively. Electroporation was performed by a single pulse of 240V at 960 μF with the Gene Pulser Apparatus (Bio-Rad). Cells were then divided into 4 independent pools and grown for 36 h in complete medium before addition of neomycin (G418) at 0.8 mg/ml. In some cases, individual clones were selected by growing the cells in methyl cellulose in the presence of G418. Cells were then harvested for DNA and RNA analyses. Copy number and level of expression of the transgene, in mice or in the transfected cells, were directly compared with that of the endogenous gene by quantitative PCR, using fluorescent primers(10Porcher C. Malinge M.C. Picat C. Grandchamp B. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). The additional five bases present in exon 2 or six bases in exon 3 of the transfected genes led to the amplification of PCR products that differed in size from those derived from the endogenous gene (see Fig. 3 for the size of the expected PCR fragments). DNA was prepared either from transfected cells (106) or from 50 to 200 μl of mouse blood. Cells were lysed in a non-ionic detergent containing buffer in the presence of proteinase K(13Kawasaki E.S. Irmis M.A. Geland D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 146-152Google Scholar). 5 μl of DNA was then amplified, using primers E2S-F and EIIIK. RNA was prepared either from 5 × 106 transfected cells or from the organs of transgenic mice using the RNAzol B as recommended by the manufacturer (Bioprobe). 2.5 μg of RNA was then reverse transcribed in a final volume of 25 μl, using 100 ng of an oligo(dT) primer and 200 units of the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2.5 μl of cDNA was then amplified by PCR, using either the E2S-F/EIIIK primers in order to specifically amplify the erythroid transcript sequences, or the pSE1/E4HS-F primers in order to specifically amplify the ubiquitous transcript sequences. PCR products were then loaded onto a denaturing gel in an Automated Laser Fluorescent DNA sequencer (Pharmacia). At the end of the electrophoresis, the area of the fluorescence peaks was calculated using the Fragment Manager integration software (Pharmacia). Calculation of the ratio of fluorescence emitted by both kinds of molecules gives either the relative copy number of the transfected genes or the relative transcript number initiated at the erythroid or ubiquitous promoters. A 12.5-kb fragment consisting of the entire gene flanked by 2.5 kb of sequences upstream of the ubiquitous promoter and 2.5 kb of 3′ sequences (Fig. 1) was injected into fertilized mouse oocytes. The transgene was modified by inserting five nucleotides into a BamHI restriction site located in exon 2, in order to compare the copy number or the level of expression of the transgene with that of the endogenous gene using a quantitative PCR technique. Four founder transgenic mice were obtained from which lines were established. No rearrangement of the construct in these four lines was detected by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Transgene expression was analyzed in one to six animals of the F1 or F2 offspring of each founder animal, at the adult stage. Mice were perfused in order to remove any contaminating blood from tissues, and RNAs were prepared from five different tissues (bone marrow, spleen, heart, liver, and brain). After reverse transcription, the corresponding cDNAs were amplified by PCR. The oligonucleotides used in the reaction hybridized to exon 2 and 4 allowing quantification of transcripts initiated at the downstream promoter. The levels of erythroid-specific PBG-D mRNA in bone marrow and spleen from animals of each line varied between 25 and 100% of that of the endogenous gene, after correcting for the copy number (Fig. 2). Transcripts driven by the erythroid promoter were correctly initiated as determined by RNase protection experiments using RNA extracted from the spleen of transgenic mice (data not shown). No PCR product from the erythroid cDNA could be detected in non-erythroid tissues from either the endogenous PBG-D gene or the transgene. These data suggest that the construct used to produce transgenic mice contained all the regulatory cis-elements necessary to determine tissue specificity of the erythroid-specific promoter and a level of expression comparable to that of the endogenous gene in transgenic mice. In order to determine the contribution of individual cis-acting elements to the regulated expression of the gene and to study the interactions between the two promoters, we performed stable transfection experiments into MEL cells. To quantify transcripts initiated at each promoter separately, the transfected gene was marked by inserting six bases into exon 3 which is present in the two mRNA species. By using two different sets of primers, it was possible to individually amplify the mRNA transcribed from the upstream housekeeping promoter and the mRNA transcribed from the downstream erythroid-specific promoter (Fig. 3A). The six-base insertion into the transfected gene enabled each type of mRNA to be recognized as either endogenous or transfected. In order to verify that this modification had no influence on the expression of the marked gene, expression levels of the erythroid mRNA were analyzed in MEL cells stably transfected with the gene marked either in exon 2 or in exon 3. In both cases, the level of expression of the erythroid promoter from the transfected gene was similar to that of the endogenous gene (not shown), in agreement with the results obtained in transgenic mice. To assess the effects of the integration site and of copy number on the level of expression initiated at both PBG-D promoters, we analyzed 16 individual clones of transfected MEL cells. The ratio of transfected versus endogenous mRNA levels measured by RT-PCR was plotted against the number of copies of the transfected gene in each individual clone. The results in Fig. 3B show that there is a good correlation between the level of expression and the number of copies for both the ubiquitous (r = 0.98) and the erythroid (r = 0.88) mRNA. The mean level of expression per copy of the transfected gene was 0.90 and 0.61 relative to the expression of the endogenous gene for ubiquitous and erythroid mRNA, respectively. In order to study the relative contribution of individual DHS to the erythroid-specific expression of the PBG-D gene, various constructs were derived from the initial plasmid pBCDEF labeled in exon 3, to remove the regions of interest. These deletion mutants were cotransfected into MEL cells with a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene, and analyses were carried out from populations of selected MEL cells. For construct pBCDEF, the mean expression per copy number of the transfected gene was identical to that of the endogenous gene (Fig. 4), in agreement with the results obtained on individual clones. Deletion of a 2.45-kb fragment located at the 5′ end of the initial construct produced a moderate decrease in the level of expression (pΔ5′BCDEF). Additional deletion of the region encompassing the housekeeping promoter and exon 1 had no further effect (pCDEF). When DHS C was removed by internal deletion of a SmaI-XhoI fragment (pBDEF), the level of expression fell to 47% of that of the endogenous gene, although this DHS is not erythroid-specific. Deletion of the 3′-flanking region, including DHS F, did not seem to have any detectable effect (pBCDE). In contrast, a point mutation abrogating the binding activity of the GATA-1 site at −40 bp relative to the erythroid transcriptional start site dramatically reduced the erythroid expression of the gene (pBCD). A critical role for this GATA motif has been shown in the homologous region of the human PBG-D gene (14Mignotte V. Eleouet F. Raich N. Romeo P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6548-6552Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, a construct containing only 494 bp of the erythroid promoter, thus including the proximal GATA-1-binding site and a duplicated CACC motif, but no other DHS (pE) showed very weak expression. These results indicate that the proximal promoter is necessary for the tissue-specific expression but does not lead by itself to full promoter activity and suggests that upstream sequences may cooperate with the erythroid promoter. When compared to the full-length pBCDEF construct, deletion of DHS D alone resulted in a reduced accumulation of the erythroid mRNA, but the level of expression remained proportional to the copy number (Fig. 5, construct pBCEF). Deletion of DHS F (construct pBCDE) did not dramatically modify the erythroid expression. In contrast, when both DHS D and F were deleted from the construct (pBCE), many clones did not express the transfected gene and a poor correlation was observed between the expression level and the copy number (r = 0.337). It therefore appears that with this construct the erythroid expression is highly sensitive to position effects. However, all the individual clones obtained with this construct expressed the housekeeping mRNA at a level similar to that of the endogenous gene when corrected for copy number (data not shown). To determine whether or not DHS D is able to prevent position effects when it is present in one single copy, we selected single copy clones of MEL cells transfected with either the initial pBCDEF construct or with a construct where only DHS D has been deleted (pBCEF). Indeed, previous studies of HS function have shown that, when multiple copy integrants are analyzed, cooperative interaction between tandemly integrated genes may potentiate their activity(15Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Quantification of both erythroid and housekeeping mRNAs from single copy transfectants of the full-length construct showed that both promoters are active at the same level as in the endogenous gene (Table 1), whereas many single copy transfectants with the pBCEF construct (where site D has been deleted) did not express the erythroid PBG-D mRNA at all. Interestingly, the same clones expressed the housekeeping mRNA from the construct, although at a variable level (m = 0.61).TABLE I Open table in a new tab DHS C, which maps downstream of the first exon has been observed in both erythroid and non-erythroid tissues(3Porcher C. Pitiot G. Plumb M. Lowe S. de Verneuil H. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10562-10569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and run-on experiments have suggested that this region may correspond to a block in the elongation of transcripts initiated at the upstream promoter(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internal deletion of this region in a construct where both promoters were conserved led to a 2-fold drop in the accumulation of erythroid transcripts in the total population of transfected MEL cells (Fig. 4). When individual clones were analyzed (Fig. 6), production of both types of mRNAs remained proportional to the copy number. Furthermore, the level of housekeeping mRNA from the transfected gene was significantly increased and when corrected for copy number, it was 1.5-fold more abundant than that from the endogenous PBG-D gene (pBDEF, Fig. 6). By contrast, the level of erythroid-specific transcripts was decreased to about 20% of the endogenous level. It therefore appears that DNA sequences at DHS C have opposite effects on the level of mRNAs initiated by the two promoters of the gene. Expression of the PBG-D gene is driven by a housekeeping promoter active in all cells and a tissue-specific promoter active only in erythroid cells. One consequence of this gene organization, which also occurs in some other genes(16Concordet J.P. Salminen M. Demignon J. Moch C. Marie P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1993; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Proudfoot N.J. Nature. 1986; 322: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is that the erythroid promoter is embedded in a ubiquitously transcriptionally active locus. Indeed it is located downstream of the housekeeping PBG-D promoter and also downstream of the H2A-X histone gene. This gene, which is located in the 3′-flanking region of the PBG-D gene, is transcribed in the reverse orientation(18Porcher C. Grandchamp B. Genomics. 1995; 25: 312-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to define the cis-acting elements controlling the expression of the mouse PBG-D gene initiated at its two promoters. In this paper, we tested the ability of a 12.5-kb fragment containing the PBG-D gene and five of six DHS (B-F, Fig. 1) to promote a high level of erythroid-specific expression in transgenic mice. In order to permit a precise comparison between the level of expression of the transgene and that of the endogenous gene, we developed a precise PCR-based assay to determine the copy number and expression level of the transgene relative to that of the endogenous gene which was used as an internal standard in this assay. Of four transgenic breeding lines tested, all expressed the mRNA initiated at the downstream promoter of the transgene and the expression was restricted to erythropoietic tissues (i.e. bone marrow and spleen). The level of expression was comparable to that of the endogenous gene when corrected for the copy number even in two lines with a single copy transgene. The same fragment, when stably transfected in to MEL cells exhibited a position-independent, copy number-dependent expression. The overall contribution of individual DHS to the erythroid expression of the gene was then studied using a series of deletion mutants that were stably transfected into MEL cells. The ubiquitous DHS F, which is located 3′ of the PBG-D gene, probably corresponds to the promoter region of the transcriptionally active H2A-X gene, and the results of transfection experiments show that deletion of this region does not bring about any reduction in PBG-D expression. Two regions seem to play a critical role in the erythroid-specific expression of the PBG-D gene: the erythroid proximal promoter and a region situated at −1000 (DHS D) relative to the initiation site. These two regions possess a chromatin structure that is modified during erythroid differentiation as demonstrated by the appearance of DNase-I hypersensitive sites specific for erythroid cells(3Porcher C. Pitiot G. Plumb M. Lowe S. de Verneuil H. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10562-10569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Study of individual clones of MEL cells revealed that the erythroid expression of the gene is subject to position effects in the absence of the upstream region, although the housekeeping transcription is not sensitive to such effects. In MEL clones that fail to express the erythroid mRNA from the transfected construct, either a negative position effect or the absence of a positive effect can theoretically be postulated. However, in the absence of a significant influence of the host chromatin on the transcription initiated at the housekeeping promoter, a global repression extending from the neighboring chromatin at the insertion locus is very unlikely to occur. In clones that express a construct lacking DHS D, DNA regions at integration sites upstream or downstream of the PBG-D gene may influence the erythroid promoter activity in a positive manner. Since these sequences are separated from the erythroid promoter by transcriptional complexes at the housekeeping promoter of the PBG-D gene and at the promoter of the H2A-X gene, this may be achieved through DNA looping mediated by protein-protein interactions. DHS D therefore appears to function like an enhancer element which cooperates with the erythroid promoter to ensure maximal transcriptional activity, in an integration site-independent manner. Interestingly, both regions have GATA-1-binding sites in close proximity to CACC/GT motifs, an association of binding sites which is a common feature of many erythroid-specific regulatory elements(19Lacronique V. Boquet D. Lopez S. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5669-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Sun J.M. Penner C.G. Davie J.R.

In addition, DHS D shares some similarities with the hypersensitive site 3 from the β-globin locus control region(24Grosveld F. Van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar, 25Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The locus control region shows strong activator as well as insulator functions that are specific for erythroid tissues(26Orkin S.H. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and it also contains several GATA-1 and CACC/GT motifs. Furthermore, hypersensitive site 3 has been shown to confer integration site independence to the linked gene(27Fraser P. Hurst J. Collis P. Grosveld F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3503-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The tandem arrangement of the housekeeping and tissue-specific promoters of the PBG-D gene raises some questions about the functioning of these two overlapping transcriptional units in erythroid cells. Transcriptional interferences have been observed when transcription from an upstream promoter down-regulates a closely linked downstream promoter in the same orientation(16Concordet J.P. Salminen M. Demignon J. Moch C. Marie P. Kahn A. Daegelen D. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1993; 13: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case of the PBG-D gene, previous data have suggested that no switch mechanism between the two promoters was involved during activation of the erythroid transcription unit(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MEL cells, both types of mRNA are present. Run-on experiments using isolated nuclei from these cells and from mouse spleen erythroblasts suggested that in erythroid cells the initiation of transcription is also enhanced at the housekeeping promoter but that most of the transcripts initiated at the upstream promoter stop downstream of the first ubiquitous exon, between the two promoters(1Beaumont C. Porcher C. Picat C. Nordmann Y. Grandchamp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14829-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region corresponding to a constitutive DHS (site C, Fig. 1) maps near this transcriptional elongation block. Our present observation that the deletion of this region results in opposite effects on the steady state levels of housekeeping and tissue-specific RNA is consistent with the hypothesis that this region promotes premature termination of the housekeeping transcripts therefore preventing promoter interference."
https://openalex.org/W2069297668,"Two different conformations of chemically equivalent Ca2+-ATPase molecules in the sarcoplasmic reticulum have been shown to non- and positive cooperatively bind two calcium ions, respectively (Nakamura, J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30822-30827). At pH 7.40, these ATPase molecules split into E1 (high affinity state for calcium) and E2 (low affinity state for calcium), respectively, before calcium binding. At this pH, calcium binding to the monomeric ATPase, solubilized with dodecyloctaethylenglycol monoether, was studied by examining 45Ca2+ binding to the ATPase and calcium dependences of its phosphorylation, fluorescence intensity, ATP-hydrolysis at a low (5 μM) concentration of ATP, and acetyl phosphate hydrolysis. The results suggest that the solubilized ATPase molecules predominantly preexist in E2 and negative cooperatively (the Hill value (nH) = 0.5-0.6) bind 2 mol of calcium/mol of the ATPase with an apparent calcium affinity (K0.5) of 3-5 μM. The nonequivalences of calcium bindings at the membranous ATPase molecules seem to result from the intermolecular interaction of the molecules. A high concentration (5 mM) of ATP modulated the binding manner so that it became positively cooperative (nH∼ 2) and increased the K0.5 to 0.1 μM. Two different conformations of chemically equivalent Ca2+-ATPase molecules in the sarcoplasmic reticulum have been shown to non- and positive cooperatively bind two calcium ions, respectively (Nakamura, J.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30822-30827). At pH 7.40, these ATPase molecules split into E1 (high affinity state for calcium) and E2 (low affinity state for calcium), respectively, before calcium binding.

A high concentration (5 mM) of ATP modulated the binding manner so that it became positively cooperative (nH∼ 2) and increased the K0.5 to 0.1 μM. Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase is a calcium pump transporting 2 mol of calcium across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane by hydrolytic coupling with 1 mol of ATP(1Tada M. Yamamoto T. Tonomura Y.

Membrane Transport of Calcium. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1982: 141-186Google Scholar). Structural studies suggest that the Ca2+-ATPase molecules are in close contact forming oligomeric units in the membrane(4Vanderkooi J.M. Ierokomas A. Nakamura H. Martonosi A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Maurer A. Hymel L. Jung C. Fleischer S. J. Biol.

The monomeric enzyme, however, has been shown to retain the same reaction cycle of ATP hydrolysis as that of the membrane form and to be a functional unit of the calcium pump(9MacIntosh D.B. Ross D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12220-12223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Heegaad C.W. Le Maire M.L. Gulik-Krzywicki T.M.J.V. J. Biol.

On the other hand, we recently found two different conformations of chemically equivalent ATPase molecules in the membrane(12Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of them is in pH-dependent equilibrium between E1 (high affinity state for calcium) and E2 (low affinity state for calcium) before calcium binding and noncooperatively binds two calcium ions with a pH-independent affinity for the calcium ions. The other molecule is predominantly in E2 independent of pH before calcium binding and positive cooperatively binds two calcium ions with a pH-dependent affinity for the calcium ions. It is likely that intermolecular interaction of the chemically equivalent ATPase molecules produces these nonequivalences of the ATPase molecules in the membrane. To verify the existence of such intermolecular interaction, it is necessary to show cancellation of the nonequivalences of the enzyme molecules in the membrane by monomerization of the molecules. Calcium binding at the monomeric enzyme has been studied for the most part by using the enzyme that is solubilized with nonionic detergent, dodecyloctaethylene glycol monoether (C12E8).1 1The abbreviations used are: C12E8dodecyloctaethylene glycol monoetherPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateEPphosphorylated Ca2+-ATPase. 1The abbreviations used are: C12E8dodecyloctaethylene glycol monoetherPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)AMP-PNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateEPphosphorylated Ca2+-ATPase. This detergent has been found to be especially suitable for the active preparation of the soluble enzyme(14le Maire M.M.J.V. Tanford C.

Based on observations of calcium dependence of ATP hydrolysis by the detergent-solubilized enzyme, Met al.(16Lind K.E.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Murphy et al.(18Murphy A.J. Pepitone M. Highsmith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3551-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that this enzyme positive cooperatively binds calcium with the same Hill value (nH∼ 2) as that of the enzyme in the membrane. Such cooperativity of the enzyme has also been observed for calcium-induced change in fluorescence intensity of the enzyme protein(19Andersen J.P.M.J.V. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8300-8307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Verjovski-Almeida and Silva(20Verjovski-Almeida S. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2940-2944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, observed cancellation of the cooperativity by solubilization of the membranous enzyme. On the other hand, studies of calcium binding at the detergent-solubilized ATPase have shown the following difficulties. (i) The ATPase activity of the solubilized enzyme is unstable in the absence of calcium and is rapidly inactivated(16Lind K.E.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) The fluorescence intensity of the enzyme protein is very sensitive to the inactivation of the enzyme(19Andersen J.P.M.J.V. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8300-8307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) The monomeric enzyme slowly aggregates for several hours(21Silva J.L. Verjovski-Almeida S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22le Maire M.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, calcium binding to the solubilized enzyme was reexamined by minimizing the degree of such difficulties. To elucidate calcium binding to the solubilized enzyme, radioactive calcium binding to the enzyme and calcium dependences of its phosphorylation, fluorescence intensity, ATP hydrolysis at a low concentration (5 μM) of ATP, and acetyl phosphate hydrolysis were studied. To compare the equilibrium of the solubilized enzyme between E1 and E2 and calcium binding of the enzyme with those of the membranous enzyme, assays were carried out at pH 7.40 where the two types of membranous enzyme molecules, described above, were shown to split into E1 and E2, respectively, before calcium binding and to apparently rapidly and slowly bind calcium in non- and positive cooperative manners, respectively. The results show that the nonequivalences of the membranous enzyme are cancelled by solubilization of the enzyme. The solubilized enzyme molecules predominantly preexist in E2 and negatively cooperate in calcium binding. The modulation of the binding manner was observed at a high concentration (5 mM) of ATP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsProcedures for isolation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum from skeletal muscle of rabbit were the same as those described in a previous article(23Nakamura J. Endo Y. Konishi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 18: 108-113Google Scholar). Membranous Ca2+-ATPase was purified from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by washing the sarcoplasmic reticulum with sodium-deoxycholate in the same manner as reported previously (24Nakamura J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) except for a decrease in the ratio of sodium deoxycholate to the reticulum protein from 1:4 to 1:5. The protein concentration was determined by the Biuret method (25Gornall A. Bardawill C.J. David M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of bovine serum albumin as a standard.In the solubilization of the membranous enzyme with C12E8, 5-20% of the ATPase activity/h was observed to be lost. This loss occurred when the enzyme (2 mg of protein/ml) was solubilized with 4 mg/ml C12E8, according to the widely practiced method of Met al.(22le Maire M.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation. At various times after the solubilization, the ATPase activity was assayed at a low concentration (0.01 mg of protein/ml) of the enzyme. However, when it was assayed at a higher concentration (0.06 mg of protein/ml) of the enzyme, no significant inactivation of the enzyme was observed for 4 h. A change in the solubilized enzyme seems to gradually proceed, this change being detected as an inactivation of the ATPase activity by higher dilution of the enzyme concentration. To minimize the degree of such change after the solubilization, the membranous ATPase was directly solubilized in each of the assay mediums with various ratios of the detergent and the enzyme protein, which are known to monomerize the enzyme molecules (15le Maire M. Lind K.E. Jorgensen K.E. Roigaard H.M.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7051-7060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lind K.E.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Assays” for details). The ratios (from 10:1 to 50:1) of the detergent to the enzyme protein that were used were much higher than that (2:1) used in the method of Met al.(22le Maire M.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The enzyme, therefore, seems to be more rapidly solubilized by the present method than by the method of Met al.(22le Maire M.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The degrees of solubilization under the various conditions were estimated to be 91-99% from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the solubilized-enzyme medium before and after centrifugation of the medium at 78,000 × g for 1 h. The ATPase activity of the solubilized ATPase was 6.0-7.5 μmol of Pi/mg of protein/min, obtained in a solution consisting of 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.12 M KCl, and 10 μM CaCl2 at pH 7.40 and 25°C. The maximum level of the phosphoenzyme was 4.4-4.6 nmol/mg of protein obtained in 0.46 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.12 M KCl, and 10 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.40 and 0°C. Radioactive calcium binding to the solubilized ATPase was assayed according to the method of Andersen et al.(11Andersen J.P. Lassen K.M.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membranous enzyme (3.0 mg of protein/ml) was solubilized in 20 mM PIPES (pH 7.40) buffer solution containing 24 mg/ml C12E8, 50 μM45CaCl2, 0.12 M KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. A Sephadex G-50 (1 × 20 cm) was used for measurement of calcium binding at 25°C. The obtained values of the bound calcium were 7.2-9.6 nmol/mg of protein. The detergent, C12E8, was obtained from Nikko Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Pyruvate kinase (500 IU/mg of protein) and lactate dehydrogenase (197 IU/mg of protein) were obtained from Sigma and Wako Chemical Co. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The other reagents were of analytical grade.Assays PhosphoenzymeThe phosphorylation reaction was manually carried out at 0°C. The enzyme (0.05 mg of protein/ml) was preincubated in a medium containing 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.40), 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.0 mg of C12E8/ml, and 37 μM [32P]ATP by agitating the medium using a magnetic stirrer at the maximum speed (1,500 rpm). At 2 min after the preincubation, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 5 mM CaCl2 using a micropipette with a volume of 200 μl (Pipetman P-200, Gilson, Middleton, WI) within 0.2 s. The volume of the reaction medium was 1 ml. The reaction was terminated within 0.2 s by the addition of 0.5 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mM Pi using a syringe with a volume of 3 ml (B-2, Nipro, Osaka, Japan) and having a needle of φ = 0.75 mm. In the reaction at more than 1 s, the trichloroacetic acid was added at the indicated times after the addition of the calcium. The reaction time within 1 s was not controlled. The trichloroacetic acid was arbitrarily added immediately after the addition of the CaCl2, and the time interval between the additions was read. The “dead” time of the experiment was about 0.2 s, and the error of the read time was ± 0.2 s, but the mixing time of the enzyme solution and the starting/stopping solution is not known. Because of this, such a mixing technique appears to be adequate to distinguish that there are two rates of phosphorylation (see Fig. 1), when the membranous enzyme is used. However, this technique cannot give accurate measurements of the half-time of the reactions in this speed range. The 32P-labeled enzyme, which was precipitated by the trichloroacetic acid, was washed 3 times as described in a previous article(13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Intrinsic Fluorescence ChangeThe enzyme (0.05 mg protein/ml) was preincubated in a medium containing 60 mM PIPES (pH 7.40), 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 μM CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml C12E8 for 5 min at 0 and 25°C. Different amounts of EGTA or CaCl2 were added to give the final free concentration, as indicated, within 10 min. At 0.05-10 μM [Ca2+], the assay medium contained 1 mM ADP to minimize inactivation of the ATPase activity of the solublized ATPase at a low concentration of calcium, as reported by Met al.(16). At 10-50 μM [Ca2+], the experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of ADP. At 50-1,000 μM [Ca2], ADP was not added. When AMP-PNP was added to the medium, ADP was omitted. The association constant for Ca-EGTA was taken as 1.233 × 107M−1(26Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. Calcium-induced change in fluorescence intensity of the enzyme was measured by using the wavelengths 285 and 333 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, as reported in a previous article(13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Enzymatic ActivitiesEnzymatic assays were performed within 5 min because after the preincubation of the solubilized enzyme in the absence of added calcium and presence of 0.1 mM EGTA for 5 min, about 90% of the ATPase activity that existed before the preincubation was retained. ATP hydrolysis of the solubilized enzyme at a low ATP concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by the linked enzyme method (27Albers R.W. Koval G.J. Siegel G.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1968; 4: 324-336PubMed Google Scholar) in 60 mM PIPES buffer solution (pH 7.40) containing 0.01 mg of protein/ml of the enzyme, 0.5 mg/ml C12E8, 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ATP, 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mM NADH, 50 IU/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 IU/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.08-1,000 μM [Ca2+] at 25°C. Before the addition of ATP to initiate the reaction, the enzyme was preincubated in the assay medium for 2 min. The reaction time was 3 min. At a high ATP concentration of 5 mM, the enzyme (0.05 mg of protein/ml) was preincubated in a medium containing 60 mM PIPES (pH 7.40), 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.15-6.5 μM CaCl2, and 2.0 mg/ml C12E8 for 2 min at 25°C. After the preincubation, the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP. The reaction time was 1.5 min. ATP hydrolysis was measured by determining the amount of phosphate liberated from ATP at 750 nm of the blue complex formed with molybdate and ferrous sulfate(28Bonting S.L. Simon K.A. Hawkins N.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Acetyl phosphate hydrolysis of the enzyme was performed in 60 mM PIPES buffer solution (pH 7.40) containing 0.5 mg of protein/ml of the enzyme, 5.0 mg/ml C12E8, 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM acetyl phosphate, and 0.05-1,000 μM [Ca2+] at 25°C. The enzyme was preincubated in the medium for 2 min before initiation of the reaction by the addition of acetyl phosphate. The reaction time was 3 min. The amount of remaining acetyl phosphate was determined according to the method of Lipmann and Tuttle(29Lipmann F. Tuttle L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 159: 21-28Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTwo populations of Ca2+-ATPase in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane that are chemically equivalent have been shown to be in pH-dependent equilibrium between E1 and E2 and predominantly independent of pH in E2, respectively, before calcium binding at 0°C(12Nakamura J. Furukohri T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30818-30821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); they apparently slowly/rapidly and slowly bind two calcium ions, respectively, dependent on pH and independent of pH, and they noncooperatively and positive cooperatively participate in the calcium binding, respectively. At pH 7.40, the two populations of Ca2+-ATPase in the membrane have also been shown to split into E1 and E2, respectively, and apparently rapidly and slowly bind calcium, respectively(12Nakamura J.

In the present study, to compare calcium binding to the detergent-solubilized, monomeric enzyme with that to the membranous enzyme, experiments were performed at this pH.As shown in Fig. 1, to estimate the kinetic calcium binding to the solubilized enzyme, calcium-induced phosphorylation of the enzyme was examined at 0°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of calcium to the enzyme, which was preincubated with ATP. The enzyme was monophasically phosphorylated at a rate of half-time (t) ∼ 1 s. No rapid phosphorylation within about 0.2 s, such as that found in one of the two membranous enzymes that was in E1 before calcium binding (cf. (13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), was observed. It is thought that all of the solubilized enzyme molecules are almost entirely in E2 before calcium binding and slowly bind calcium because of the slow transition of the enzyme from E2 to E1 after the addition of calcium. Fig. 2 shows calcium-induced change in fluorescence intensity of the enzyme protein as a function of calcium concentration. To compare the calcium-dependent change with that of the enzymatic activities, which will be mentioned below, experiments on the fluorescence change were performed at 25°C. One millimolar ADP was added to the assay medium at less than 50 μM [Ca2+]. ADP has been found to stabilize the solubilized enzyme in the absence of calcium(16Lind K.E.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ADP did not affect calcium dependence of the calcium-induced fluorescence change in the membranous enzyme (data not shown). The calcium dependence exhibited a profile with a Hill value of less than 1 (0.5-0.6) and an apparent calcium affinity (K0.5) of about 5 μM. The profile that was observed at 25°C was entirely the same as that at 0°C (data not shown). The solubilized enzyme seems to negatively cooperate in calcium binding independent of temperature. The calcium-dependent profiles (nH∼ 0.6 and K0.5∼ 3 μM) of the ATP hydrolysis at a low concentration (5 μM) of ATP (Fig. 3) and the acetyl phosphate hydrolysis (Fig. 4) were in good agreement with that of the fluorescence change. Acetyl phosphate has been shown to serve as a substrate for the enzyme(30de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 343-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This result supports the existence of negative cooperation in calcium binding of the solubilized enzyme, which was discussed above. At 50 μM [Ca2+], the amount of calcium bound to the solubilized enzyme was 7.2-9.6 nmol/mg of protein. At this calcium concentration, 80-90% of calcium binding capacity of the enzyme is estimated to be filled with calcium based on the calcium-dependent profiles of the fluorescence intensity, the ATP hydrolysis, and the acetyl phosphate hydrolysis, shown in Figs. 2-4, respectively. The maximum level of the phosphorylated enzyme was 4.4-4.6 nmol/mg of protein. Thus, it is thought that the solubilized enzyme binds two calcium ions/mol of the enzyme, which is required for phosphorylation of the enzyme, as with the enzyme in the membrane as reported by Andersen et al.(11Andersen J.P. Lassen K.M.J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results that were obtained here, therefore, suggest that the solubilized enzyme negative cooperatively binds two calcium ions, implying calcium binding at a first site of the enzyme followed by a marked decrease in calcium affinity at a second site and binding to that site. The monomeric ATPase molecule itself seems to be in an inferior state as a calcium pump, compared with the two types of ATPase molecules in the membrane which noncooperatively and positive cooperatively bind two calcium ions, respectively(13Nakamura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30822-30827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results also show that the nonequivalences of the membranous enzyme molecules for equilibrium between E1 and E2 and for cooperativity of the binding are cancelled by solubilization of the enzyme molecules. It is thought that intermolecular interaction of the ATPase molecules forms two different conformations of the molecules, either of which is distinct from that of the monomeric molecule. In other words, it is likely that the monomeric molecule is in an “immature” or “undifferentiated” state of functional conformation and matures or differentiates into two different functional conformations of the oligomer in the membrane. To confirm this hypothesis, we are currently studying calcium binding at the membranous, monomeric molecule, which is reconstituted with excess phospholipid.Figure 2:Fluorescence intensity change of the ATPase protein as a function of calcium concentration. A, calcium titration curve of the calcium-induced fluorescence change. The enzyme (0.05 mg of protein/ml) was incubated in a medium containing 60 mM PIPES (pH 7.40), 0.12 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ADP (•) or 1 mM AMP-PNP (▴) or absence of both (○), 50 μM CaCl2, and 2 mg/ml C12E8. Different amounts of EGTA or CaCl2 were added to give the final calcium concentrations shown.

Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Murphy A.J. Pepitone M. Highsmith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3551-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 5, ATP hydrolysis as a function of calcium concentration was reexamined at 5 mM ATP. As in earlier reports(16Lind K.E.M.J.V. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Murphy A.J. Pepitone M. Highsmith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3551-3554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the calcium-dependent profile of the activity was positively cooperative with nH∼ 2.2. K0.5 was about 0.1 μM, which was about 30-50 times higher than that (3-5 μM) at the low ATP. This suggests that a high level of ATP modifies the conformation of the solubilized, monomeric enzyme molecule, resulting in the modulation of the binding manner of the molecule from negative cooperative to positive cooperative and in the increases in the affinity for calcium, i.e. the monomeric molecule is able to attain a state suitable to act as a calcium pump with the help of the ATP. Based on the observations of no modulation by low ATP, which was shown in Fig. 3, the modulation by a high level of ATP seems to be produced through ATP binding at the “regulatory” site of the enzyme rather than the binding at the catalytic site. The regulatory site is thought to be a site at which ATP binding accelerates the turnover of the catalytic activity of the membranous enzyme with lower affinity (K0.5∼ 5 mM) (31Dupont Y. Eur. J.

In this study we have investigated the potential link between translation and stability of the yeast GCN4 mRNA whose translational rates change with respect to amino acid availability. We observed that under conditions favoring its translation, the steady state levels of the GCN4 mRNA were decreased, but this was not due to a measurable alternation in its decay rate. We have demonstrated that an extensive destabilization of this message is intimately coupled with its increased access to heavy polysomes, which occurs transiently in the process of translational derepression.

The process of genetic information flow involves, among other things, the turnover of mRNA, the template for translation. In the last few years, several studies have revealed an underlying relationship between the decay rates of a large variety of different mRNAs and their respective translational efficiencies (for reviews, see (1Atwater J.A. Wisdom R. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 519-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of mRNA Stability.

Using one experimental approach, it was shown that inhibition of protein synthesis by antibiotics results in stabilization of many mRNAs as is the case of histone(4Graves R.A. Pandey N.B. Chodchoy N.

In yeast, it has been shown that almost all mRNAs are stabilized in the presence of the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide(10Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell.

The above studies point to the existence of a mechanism that serves to couple the intrinsic rate of mRNA decay with its rate of translation. Two molecular mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to account for this coupling. First, a ribosome-associated nuclease or another degradation factor might be responsible, which becomes active when the ribosome interacts with destabilizing elements within the mRNA. Alternatively, the degradation mechanism may require labile cytoplasmic factor(s) that are rapidly lost upon protein synthesis inhibition. A different experimental strategy employed alterations on the mRNA structure, that either introduce premature stop codons or block translation initiation. Premature translation termination has been shown to increase the rate of mRNA turnover in a number of cases, a phenomenon that has been described as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay(2Peltz S.W.

Using this approach, it was shown that the selective degradation of the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA is coupled to ongoing translation of this mRNA(9Aharon T. Schneider R.J.

All of the experimental strategies described so far have the common disadvantage of utilizing nonnatural conditions, either drugs or mutated mRNAs. Therefore, it is not surprising to encounter cases of apparently contradictory results as in the case of c-fos mRNA(15Koeller D.M. Horowitz J.A. Casey J.L. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Schiavi S.C. Wellinton C.L. Shyu A. Chen C.A. Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to overcome this major disadvantage, we decided to investigate the decay rates of an mRNA that is translationally regulated in vivo. The yeast GCN4 mRNA is under translational regulation imposed by its primary structure. This message is poorly translated when cells are grown in media containing all amino acids (rich media) due to the negative effects on translation of the four small open reading frames (ORFs) located in its 5′-UTR(16Thireos G. Driscoll-Penn M. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Tzamarias D. Alexandraki D. Thireos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S.

However, when the cells are grown under amino acid limitation conditions, GCN4 mRNA is translationally derepressed. Therefore, this mRNA offered us the opportunity to investigate in vivo the relationship of mRNA stability with translational rates. We have demonstrated that the GCN4 mRNA is transiently destabilized when its translation rate is increased. All yeast strains used in this study were derivatives of S288C cured for the GAL2 deficiency. In detail, these were as follows: MATa ura3-52 leu2-2, MATa gcn2-11 ura3-52 leu2-2, MATa rpb1-1 ura3-52. The rpb1-1 strain was kindly provided by A. Jacobson. GCN4 derepresing conditions were accomplished by growing leucine auxotroph cells in minimal medium for 6 h. Minimal medium contained yeast nitrogen base (Difco) and 2% glucose. All 20 amino acids were supplemented when necessary. The construction of GCN4-LacZ, ΔORFGCN4 and ΔORFGCN4-LacZ has been described elsewhere(16Thireos G. Driscoll-Penn M. Greer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The DED1-LacZ plasmid was constructed by inserting the ScaI/SalI DNA fragment from ΔORFGCN4-LacZ, which contains the GCN4-LacZ gene, from the initiation of transcription of GCN4 to the end of LacZ, into the HindIII site of Ycp88, which is located just downstream of the promoter of DED1(19Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The GCREHIS3-LacZ fusion contains the GCR element within unique BamHI and EcoRI sites in the promoter of HIS3-LacZ, which was modified to include only the regulated TATA element 18 base pairs downstream. This reporter gene is on a centromeric yeast plasmid carrying URA3 for selection and was obtained from K. Struhl. Construction of Yep24-GCN2 has been described previously(20Roussou I. Thireos G. Hauge B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA was extracted from the indicated strains grown under the appropriate conditions as described previously(21Driscoll-Penn M. Thireos G. Greer H. Mol. Cell.

The DNA probes used where as follows: the 1.1-kilobase BamHI-PvuII DNA fragment of the GCN4 gene and the 2.1-kilobase BamHI-HindIII DNA fragment from pRIP1 (22Parker R. Jacobson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) kindly provided by A. Jacobson, containing the PGK1 gene. mRNA decay rates were measured in a strain harboring the rpb1-1 allele as described previously(2Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 231-328Google Scholar, 10Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Transformations were carried out with the lithium acetate method(23Ito H. Fucuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously(17Tzamarias D. Alexandraki D. Thireos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4849-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To delineate the possible relationship between the GCN4 mRNA translational status and the corresponding steady state mRNA levels, we took advantage of the available genetic means to affect GCN4 mRNA translation. In total, three different approaches were undertaken. First, we induced GCN4 mRNA translation by overexpressing, in wild-type cells, the GCN2 protein kinase that, by phosphorylating the α subunit of the eIF2, relieves the translational repression of the GCN4 mRNA(20Roussou I. Thireos G. Hauge B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is shown in Fig. 1C (wt, wt/HGCN2, +Leu), where the translational status of the GCN4 mRNA was monitored by assaying for β-galactosidase activity produced by a reporter gene driven by the GCN4 promoter and bearing the 5′-UTR of GCN4. As shown in Fig. 1A, the GCN4 mRNA levels were decreased approximately 3-fold (±0.2) in this genetic background as compared with a wild-type strain (GCN4 mRNA, lane1versuslane2). Second, we investigated whether a blockage in the translation derepression of the GCN4 mRNA had the opposite effect on its levels. The above described analysis was performed using a gcn2 mutant strain, where the Gcn2 protein kinase has been inactivated. In such strains, translation of GCN4 mRNA is low and cannot be derepressed (20, 24, Fig. 1C, gcn2, +Leu, -Leu). In this background, the steady state amount of GCN4 mRNA was increased 2.5-fold (±0.3) above the levels of a wild-type strain (Fig. 1B, lanes1 and 3). Third, we introduced into a wild-type and a gcn2 strain, a plasmid bearing a GCN4 gene derivative deleted for the four upstream ORFs and thus relieved from translational repression (ΔORFGCN4). As it can be seen in Fig. 2(GCN4-LacZversusΔORFGCN4-LacZ, +Leu), a GCN4-LacZ reporter gene devoid of its 5′-UTR produces under repressing conditions a 50-fold excess of β-galactosidase compared with the one containing the 5′-UTR. It was expected that the resulting increase in the amount of Gcn4 will activate transcription of the GCN2 gene and thus will induce translational derepression of the GCN4 mRNA (20Roussou I. Thireos G. Hauge B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2132-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, in this ΔORFGCN4-transformed wild-type strain, the endogenous GCN4 mRNA was translationally derepressed (Fig. 1C, wt, wt/ΔORFGCN4, +Leu). By contrast and as anticipated, the ΔORFGCN4-induced translational derepression of the endogenous GCN4 mRNA did not occur in a gcn2 strain (Fig. 1C, gcn2, gcn2/ΔORFGCN4, +Leu). We again observed that the endogenous GCN4 mRNA was decreased approximately 2-fold (±0.1) in a ΔORFGCN4-transformed wild-type, as compared with a gcn2 strain (Fig. 1B, lanes2 and 4). An interesting observation from this series of experiments was that the steady state levels of the highly translatable ΔORFGCN4 mRNA were 1.5-fold (±0.2) lower than those of the endogenous GCN4 mRNA (Fig. 1B, lanes2 and 4). The reduction in the GCN4 mRNA levels could not be attributed to the Gcn2 protein kinase specifically, since the elevation of the Gcn2-independent GCN4 mRNA translation that results from overexpression of a variant tRNAVal(25Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Wek R.C. San Segundo P. Truesdell A.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7920-7932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also effected the same reduction in the GCN4 mRNA levels (not shown). The totality of the evidence presented above, revealed a relationship between the GCN4 mRNA translational status and its steady state levels. Whenever GCN4 mRNA was translationally derepressed, its mRNA levels were decreased. One possible explanation for the above observed variations in the GCN4 mRNA levels is a decrease in the transcription of the GCN4 gene effected by the known squelching properties of high levels of Gcn4(26Tavernarakis N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In order to address this possibility, we examined the expression of a LacZ reporter gene driven by the GCN4 promoter. Cells were grown under nonstarvation conditions for low, starvation conditions for moderate, and transformed with ΔORFGCN4 for high Gcn4 levels. The intracellular levels of Gcn4 were indirectly monitored by assaying for β-galactosidase produced by a LacZ reporter driven by a promoter bearing the Gcn4 DNA binding site (GCRE-LacZ, Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, the transcription driven by the GCN4 promoter was only slightly affected by the intracellular levels of Gcn4. Therefore, the observed differences in the GCN4 mRNA levels must, for the most part, be the consequence of alterations in the mRNA half-lives under the translation conditions imposed. To determine the GCN4 mRNA half-life when translated with low or moderate rates, we employed the rpb1-1 mutant strain (kindly provided by Allan Jacobson). A time course analysis of the levels of a given mRNA in this strain, following a shift from 24 to 37°C, provides an estimate for its decay rates(2Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of mRNA Stability. Academic Press, New York1993: 231-328Google Scholar). Two strains were used for such an analysis: the rpb1-1 strain and the rpb1-1 strain, transformed with the ΔORFGCN4 gene derivative to induce the translation of the endogenous GCN4 mRNA to moderate rates. As shown in Fig. 3, we did not observe any significant differences in the decay rates of the GCN4 mRNA in these two strains. In both strains, the half-life was approximately 15 min (±1), as it has been reported previously(15Koeller D.M. Horowitz J.A. Casey J.L. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7778-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, the ΔORFGCN4 mRNA, although highly translated, had a decay rate similar to that of the wild-type message. Based on our previous results, reporting that during a nutritional downshift GCN4 mRNA is transiently loaded with heavy polysomes(27Tzamarias D. Roussou I. Thireos G. Cell. 1989; 57: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we envisioned a situation where a transient change in the decay rate of the GCN4 mRNA would take place only immediately after the change in its translational status. When the translation rate would settle to a certain equilibrium, then the GCN4 mRNA decay rate would be readjusted to its original value. This transient destabilization would then account for the decreased steady state levels. We addressed the above hypothesis by monitoring the amount of the GCN4 mRNA under conditions inducing rapid translational derepression. A shift from rich to minimal medium, which was previously shown to result in an acute increase in the translation of the GCN4 mRNA(27Tzamarias D. Roussou I. Thireos G. Cell. 1989; 57: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was imposed to wild-type cells. When the cells were transferred to minimal medium, the amount of GCN4 mRNA detected within the first 3-5 min after the shift was decreased (Fig. 4A). In the reverse experiment, when the cells were returned to rich medium, the relative GCN4 mRNA amount was increased within the first 5 min. The short period of time (relative to the normal half-life) required to observe these changes implied an abrupt change in the decay rate of the message. In order to confirm this, we measured decay rates under the above conditions. rpb1-1 mutant cells, growing at 24°C in rich medium, were shifted to 37°C and simultaneously to starvation medium. In a parallel control experiment, only the temperature shift was imposed to the cells. The amount of GCN4 mRNA detected at the various time points after the double and the single shift is shown in Fig. 4B. When just the temperature shift was imposed, the typical decay rate (15 ± 1 min) was observed, as expected (Fig. 4B, rowa). However, when the cells underwent an additional nutritional shift, the GCN4 mRNA decay rate was increased 2.6-fold (±0.3) within the first 3-5 min (Fig. 4B, rowb). This effect was not a general consequence of the nutritional shift since the decay rates of the PGK1 mRNA were not similarly affected (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the GCN4 mRNA is destabilized in parallel with a drastic increase in its translational rate. We have revealed the existence of a link between the stability of the GCN4 mRNA and a transient but drastic change in its translational status. This finding is in agreement with a plethora of published reports indicating that decreased rates of mRNA decay are coupled with a translational blockage imposed either through inhibitors or structural alterations. Our results present an example of a natural mRNA whose translational efficiency determines its decay rates and provide a new natural model through which the mechanism of translationally coupled mRNA decay rates can be studied. A first indication for a link between translational and decay rates came from measuring the steady state levels of the GCN4 mRNA. Moderate translational derepression was imposed by increasing in vivo the amount of the Gcn2 protein kinase. The alternative of imposing amino acid starvation conditions by utilizing inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis such as 3-AT (17Tzamarias D. Alexandraki D. Thireos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4849-4853Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was avoided since such treatment results in stabilization of mRNAs carrying nonsense codons(28Peltz S. He F. Welch E. Jacobson A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. & Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In all cases examined, an inverse influence of translation on the GCN4 mRNA levels was observed, which was not the result of altered transcriptional rates. Such a drastic decrease in steady state levels was not easily justified as a consequence of a change in the translational status, since these conditions result in only a slight shift of the polysomal distribution of the GCN4 mRNA toward heavier polysomes(26Tavernarakis N. Thireos G. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the measured decay rates of the GCN4 mRNA were unaffected under conditions of low or moderate translation. The apparent paradox concerning the determinants of the GCN4 mRNA steady state levels could be resolved only by considering a transient change in the decay rate that readjusts the final steady state levels. In order to solve this problem, we followed the GCN4 mRNA decay rates in a temporal manner. It was known that a transient and dramatic increase in the rate of the GCN4 mRNA translation is effected rapidly after the removal of amino acids from the growth medium(27Tzamarias D. Roussou I. Thireos G. Cell. 1989; 57: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, by using such a temporal analysis during a nutritional shift, we revealed that the decay rate of the GCN4 mRNA dramatically increases within a very short period of time following the initiation of translational derepression. Therefore, based on the sensitivity of the method employed, we may conclude that a transient destabilization of the GCN4 mRNA is tightly coupled with its shift to heavy polysomes. The possibility that the observed transient phenomenon could be due to unrelated physiological changes is unlikely, since the decay rates of the reference mRNA (PGK1) remained constant during the experiment. Two major conclusions can be drawn from the combined interpretation of the above experimental results. One is that the apparent increased decay rate of GCN4 mRNA is coupled with its increased access to heavy polysomes. The second is that the apparent decrease in the steady state levels of this message under conditions of moderate translation should be the consequence of a transient destabilization inherited in the physiology of translational derepression of the GCN4 mRNA. This interpretation emphasizes the fact that the understanding of steady state phenomena should consider the dynamic process of their establishment. It is worthwhile to discuss our observations concerning the decay rates of the ΔORFGCN4 mRNA. This message is degraded with the same rate as the endogenous GCN4 mRNA, even though it is always associated with a larger number of ribosomes(27Tzamarias D. Roussou I. Thireos G. Cell. 1989; 57: 947-954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It should be noted however, that this is a different mRNA, lacking most of the 5′-UTR containing the upstream ORFs. One could consider that this region contains a destabilizing element that adds to the observed decay rate of the GCN4 mRNA, whereas the ΔORFGCN4 mRNA is subjected mainly to the ribosome associated degradation machinery. It is tempting to speculate that this instability is mediated by the proposed nonsense mRNA decay mechanism (29Leeds P. Peltz S. Jacobson A. Culbertson M. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) due to the presence of the four small ORFs. We suggest that the net effect of these two opposing mechanisms contributes to the overall decay rate of the GCN4 mRNA. The coupling of translational derepression with changes in mRNA decay rates poses several questions regarding the nature of this phenomenon. Is it just the consequence of a physical association between the GCN4 mRNA and the ribosomes on which the decay machinery might reside, or is GCN4 mRNA degradation an additional step in GCN4 regulation? Given the body of information that has been accumulated, we believe that the former is true. The apparent contradiction in the biology of the response between the translational derepression and the increased decay rates for the overall increase in the amount of Gcn4, could be resolved by considering the recently demonstrated increased stability of this protein under amino acid starvation conditions(30Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R. Fink G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).
