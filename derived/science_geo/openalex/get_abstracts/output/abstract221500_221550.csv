https://openalex.org/W2122205071,"The BRCA2 gene is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancer, and its product is implicated in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Here we identify a protein, EMSY, which binds BRCA2 within a region (exon 3) deleted in cancer. EMSY is capable of silencing the activation potential of BRCA2 exon 3, associates with chromatin regulators HP1β and BS69, and localizes to sites of repair following DNA damage. EMSY maps to chromosome 11q13.5, a region known to be involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We show that the EMSY gene is amplified almost exclusively in sporadic breast cancer (13%) and higher-grade ovarian cancer (17%). In addition, EMSY amplification is associated with worse survival, particularly in node-negative breast cancer, suggesting that it may be of prognostic value. The remarkable clinical overlap between sporadic EMSY amplification and familial BRCA2 deletion implicates a BRCA2 pathway in sporadic breast and ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2006561389,"Despite the ease of inhibiting immune responses by blockade of T-cell costimulation in naive rodent models, it is difficult to suppress those responses in animals with memory cells. Studies demonstrating the importance of alloreactive T-cell deletion during tolerance induction have promoted use of peritransplant T-cell-depleting therapies in clinical trials. But potentially complicating wide-scale, nonspecific T-cell depletion is the finding that extensive T-cell proliferation can occur under conditions of lymphopenia. This process, termed homeostatic proliferation, may induce acquisition of functional memory T cells. Here, using clinically relevant mouse models of peripheral T-cell depletion, we show that residual nondepleted T cells undergo substantial homeostatic expansion. In this setting, costimulatory blockade neither significantly suppresses homeostatic proliferation nor prevents allograft rejection. In addition, T cells that have completed homeostatic proliferation show dominant resistance to tolerance when adoptively transferred into wild-type recipients, consistent with known properties of memory cells in vivo. These findings establish the importance of homeostatic proliferation in clinically relevant settings, demonstrate the barrier that homeostatic proliferation can present to the induction of transplantation tolerance, and have important implications for transplantation protocols that use partial or complete peripheral T-cell depletion."
https://openalex.org/W1989652455,"In contrast to our increasingly detailed understanding of how synaptic plasticity provides a cellular substrate for learning and memory, it is less clear how a neuron's voltage-gated ion channels interact with plastic changes in synaptic strength to influence behavior. We find, using generalized and regional knockout mice, that deletion of the HCN1 channel causes profound motor learning and memory deficits in swimming and rotarod tasks. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are a key component of the cerebellar circuit for learning of correctly timed movements, HCN1 mediates an inward current that stabilizes the integrative properties of Purkinje cells and ensures that their input-output function is independent of the previous history of their activity. We suggest that this nonsynaptic integrative function of HCN1 is required for accurate decoding of input patterns and thereby enables synaptic plasticity to appropriately influence the performance of motor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2022893562,"Rad53 and Mec1 are protein kinases required for DNA replication and recovery from DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we show that rad53, but not mec1 mutants, are extremely sensitive to histone overexpression, as Rad53 is required for degradation of excess histones. Consequently, excess histones accumulate in rad53 mutants, resulting in slow growth, DNA damage sensitivity, and chromosome loss phenotypes that are significantly suppressed by a reduction in histone gene dosage. Rad53 monitors excess histones by associating with them in a dynamic complex that is modulated by its kinase activity. Our results argue that Rad53 contributes to genome stability independently of Mec1 by preventing the damaging effects of excess histones both during normal cell cycle progression and in response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1989032142,"We undertook a case–control study to examine the possible associations of the TP53 variants Arg>Pro at codon 72 and p53PIN3, a 16 bp insertion/duplication in intron 3, with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). The p53PIN3 A2 allele (16 bp duplication) was associated with an increased risk (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.10−2.18, P=0.012), of the same order of magnitude as that observed in previous studies for other types of cancer. The Pro72 allele was weakly associated with CRC (OR=1.34, 95% CI 0.98−1.84, P=0.066). The possible functional role of p53PIN3 was investigated by examining the TP53 mRNA transcripts in 15 lymphoblastoid cell lines with different genotypes. The possibility that the insertion/deletion could lead to alternatively spliced mRNAs was excluded. However, we found reduced levels of TP53 mRNA associated with the A2 allele. In conclusion, the epidemiological study suggests a role for p53PIN3 in tumorigenesis, supported by the in vitro characterization of this variant."

https://openalex.org/W1979513962,"The precise molecular mechanism underlying arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3))-induced apoptosis is a subject of extensive study. Here, we show that clinically relevant doses of As(2)O(3) can induce typical apoptosis in IM-9, a multiple myeloma cell line, in a Bcl-2 inhibitable manner. We confirmed that As(2)O(3) directly induced cytochrome c (cyto c) release from isolated mouse liver mitochondria via the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and we further identified the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) as a biological target of As(2)O(3) responsible for eliciting cyto c release in apoptosis. First, pretreatment of the isolated mitochondria with an anti-VDAC antibody specifically prevented As(2)O(3)-induced cyto c release. Second, in proteoliposome experiments, VDAC by itself was sufficient to mediate As(2)O(3)-induced cyto c release, which could be specifically inhibited by Bcl-X(L). Third, As(2)O(3) induced mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim) reduction and cyto c release only in the VDAC-expressing, but not in the VDAC-deficient yeast strain. Finally, we found that As(2)O(3) induced the increased expression and homodimerization of VDAC in IM-9 cells, but not in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells, suggesting that VDAC homodimerization could potentially determine its gating capacity to cyto c, and Bcl-2 blockage of VDAC homodimerization represents a novel mechanism for its inhibition of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2018399328,"The replication checkpoint controls the integrity of replicating chromosomes by stabilizing stalled forks, thus preventing the accumulation of abnormal replication and recombination intermediates that contribute to genome instability. Checkpoint-defective cells are susceptible to rearrangements at chromosome fragile sites when replication pauses, and certain human cancer prone diseases suffer checkpoint abnormalities. It is unclear as to how the checkpoint stabilizes stalled forks and how cells sense replication blocks. We have analysed the checkpoint contribution in controlling replisome-fork association when replication pauses. We show that in yeast wild-type cells, stalled forks exhibit stable replisome complexes and the checkpoint sensors Ddc1 and Ddc2, thus activating Rad53 checkpoint kinase. Ddc1/Ddc2 recruitment on stalled forks and Rad53 activation are influenced by the single-strand-binding protein replication factor A (RFA). rad53 forks exhibit a defective association with DNA polymerases alpha, epsilon and delta. Further, in rad53 mutants, stalled forks progressively generate abnormal structures that turn into checkpoint signals by accumulating RFA, Ddc1 and Ddc2. We suggest that, following replication blocks, checkpoint activation mediated by RFA-ssDNA filaments stabilizes stalled forks by controlling replisome-fork association, thus preventing unscheduled recruitment of recombination enzymes that could otherwise cause the pathological processing of the forks."
https://openalex.org/W1977427732,"Both heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) are involved in the pathogenesis of human cancer and their functions are closely associated with apoptosis. However, how these two molecules regulate apoptosis in human gastric cancer is unknown. In this study, we studied how HO-1 and p21 were regulated in two gastric cancer cell lines, MKN-45 with wild p53 and MKN-28 with mutant p53. The cells were treated with hemin and cadmium to induce HO-1. The result showed that HO-1 protein was significantly induced by hemin and cadmium in both cells tested. Following the HO-1 expression, p21 level was also markedly induced. The cells with increased HO-1 and p21 showed obviously resistantance to apoptotic stimuli. The levels of HO-1 and p21 induced were significantly inhibited by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor (SB203580) and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor (PD098059). Parallel to decreased HO-1 and p21 expression, the kinase inhibitors also significantly attenuated the resistance of the cells to apoptosis. The elevated HO-1 and p21 was further found to be associated with increase activity of the nuclear NF-kappaB and the inhibition of NF-kappaB led to the block of their induction. The elevated HO-1 and p21 were also demonstrated to be related to increased cellular inhibitor of caspase inbitory protein-2 (c-IAP2) and decreased caspapse-3 activity. It was noted that the above changes observed were not different between MKN-45 and MKN-28 cells, suggesting the functions of HO-1 and p21 were irrespective of the status of p53. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the resistance to apoptosis in gastric cancer cells with elevated HO-1 and p21 is independent of p53 status in a p38 MAPK- and ERK-mediated pathway with elevated c-IAP2 and decreased caspase-3 activity and that this pathway is sensitive to the inhibition of NF-kappaB."

https://openalex.org/W2026711972,"Subtraction hybridization identified melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7, in the context of terminally differentiated human melanoma cells. Based on its structure, cytokine-like properties and proposed mode of action, mda-7 has now been classified as IL-24. When expressed by means of a replication-incompetent adenovirus, Ad.mda-7 induces apoptosis in a broad range of cancer cells, without inducing harmful effects in normal fibroblast or epithelial cells. These unique properties of mda-7/IL-24 suggest that this gene will prove beneficial for cancer gene therapy. We now demonstrate that Ad.mda-7 decreases viability by induction of apoptosis in hormone-responsive (LNCaP) and hormone-independent (DU-145 and PC-3) human prostate carcinomas, without altering growth or survival in early-passage normal human prostate epithelial cells (HuPEC). Ad.mda-7 causes G2/M arrest and apoptosis in LNCaP (p53-wildtype), DU-145 (p53 mutant, Bax-negative) and PC-3 (p53-negative) prostate carcinomas, but not in HuPEC. Apoptosis induction correlated with changes in the ratio of pro- to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. A potential functional role for changes in bcl-2 family gene expression in Ad.mda-7-induced apoptosis was suggested by the finding that forced overexpression of bcl-xL or bcl-2 differentially diminished the apoptotic effect of Ad.mda-7 in prostate carcinomas. These results confirm that induction of apoptosis by the mda-7/IL-24 gene in prostate cancer cells is Bax- and p53-independent and is mediated by mitochondrial pathways involving bcl-2 family gene members. The mda-7/IL-24 gene represents a new class of cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing genes with obvious potential for the targeted gene-based therapy of human prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2073764409,"Cyclin D-dependent kinases phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and play a critical role in neuronal cell cycle control and apoptosis. Here we show that cyclin D1 became predominantly cytoplasmic as primary cortical progenitor cells underwent cell cycle withdrawal and terminal differentiation. Furthermore, ectopically expressed cyclin D1 sequestered in the cytoplasm of postmitotic neurons, whereas it efficiently entered the nucleus of proliferating progenitor cells. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1 were complexed with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and also with CDK inhibitors, p27KipI or p21CipI, which positively regulate assembly and nuclear accumulation of the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex. Although overexpression of p21CipI promoted cyclin D1 nuclear localization, inhibition of either glycogen synthase kinase 3β- or CRM1-mediated cyclin D1 nuclear export did not, suggesting that the inhibition of its nuclear import, rather than the acceleration of nuclear export, contributes to cytoplasmic sequestration of cyclin D1 in postmitotic neurons. In differentiated progenitor cells, nuclear localization of ectopic cyclin D1 induced apoptosis, and the DNA-damaging compound camptothecin caused nuclear accumulation of endogenous cyclin D1, accompanied by Rb phosphorylation. These results indicate that nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 is inhibited in postmitotic neurons and suggest a role of its subcellular localization in neuronal death and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2053716029,"Matrilysin (MMP-7) is thought to contribute to invasive growth and metastasis of colon carcinoma and many other human cancers. The present study demonstrates that treatment of human colon carcinoma cells with active matrilysin induces cell aggregation in vitro and promotes liver metastasis in nude mice. When two kinds of colon carcinoma cell lines were incubated with active matrilysin, this enzyme efficiently bound to the cell surface and induced loose cell aggregation, which led to E-cadherin-mediated tight cell aggregation. Synthetic MMP inhibitors inhibited both the membrane binding of matrilysin and matrilysin-induced cell aggregation, while TIMP-2 inhibited only the cell aggregation. Two other active MMPs, stromelysin and gelatinase A, neither bound to cell membrane nor induced cell aggregation. Tumor cells in loose cell aggregates could reaggregate even after they were freed from matrilysin and dispersed. When injected into the spleen of nude mice, the tumor cells in the stable aggregates produced much larger metastatic nodules in the livers than control cells and those in the loose aggregates. These results suggest that matrilysin may enhance metastatic potential of tumor cells by processing a cell surface protein(s) and thereby inducing loose and then tight aggregation of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980101293,"Cyclooxygenases, particularly COX-2, play an important role in tumor development and progression. We have previously shown that COX-2 expression is an independent prognostic factor in human ovarian carcinoma. In this study, we investigated the effects of the inhibition of COX isoforms by the NSAID NS-398 as well as by COX-isoform-specific RNA interference (RNAi) in the human ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3. OVCAR-3 cells showed a constitutive expression of COX-1 and an induction of high levels of COX-2 and PGE(2) after stimulation with interleukin-1beta. In contrast, SKOV-3 cells were negative for both COX isoforms. In OVCAR-3 cells, PGE(2) production was inhibited by NS-398 in concentrations of 1 microM and by a COX-2-specific silencing RNA (siRNA), while a COX-1-specific siRNA did not have an effect. This suggests that COX-2 is the major source of PGE(2) in this cell line. To dissociate COX-2-specific and non-COX-2-specific effects on cell proliferation, a proliferation assay was performed after incubation of cells with NS-398 and COX siRNAs. NS-398 induced an inhibition of cell proliferation at concentrations of 50-500 microM, which are above the concentrations needed for the inhibition of PGE(2) production. This inhibitory effect was present in the COX-positive cell line OVCAR-3 as well as in the COX-negative cell line SKOV-3 and could not be reverted by addition of exogenous PGE(2). Neither COX-1- nor COX-2-specific siRNAs had an effect on cell proliferation of OVCAR-3 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed an increased accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase after treatment with NS-398, but not with COX siRNAs. These experiments suggest that NS-398 reduced cell proliferation in ovarian carcinoma cells by induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest independent of COX-2 inhibition. Our study shows that specific inhibition of COX isoforms by RNAi could be used to dissociate effects of NSAIDs. Furthermore, our results suggest that cell cycle arrest is one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative effects of NS-398 on ovarian carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2013276620,"Inappropriate expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes and/or their protein products are a frequent finding in pituitary tumours; however, genetic changes associated with or responsible for their dysregulation are in general uncommon. In a search for novel genes, and employing cDNA-representational difference analysis, the gene encoding GADD45γ was recently isolated and identified as being under-represented in pituitary adenomas. GADD45γ is a member of a family of genes that are induced by DNA damage and function in the negative regulation of cell growth. In this study, we further confirm this initial report that the majority of pituitary adenomas (22 of 33; 67%) do not express GADD45γ as determined by RT–PCR analysis. Loss of expression was not associated with either loss of heterozygosity or mutations within the coding region of this gene. In marked contrast, epigenetic change, namely methylation of the GADD45γ genes CpG island, was a frequent finding (19 of 33 adenoma; 58%) and was significantly associated with tumours in which GADD45γ transcript was not expressed (18 of 22; 82%; P=0.002). In common with the primary tumours, methylation-associated gene silencing of the GADD45γ gene was also found in the pituitary tumour cell line AtT20. The treatment of AtT20 cells with the demethylating agent, 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine, induced the re-expression of this gene. These findings show that silencing of the GADD45γ gene in pituitary tumours is primarily associated with methylation of the genes CpG island. Methylation has functional importance since reversal of this epigenetic change in a pituitary-derived cell line is associated with re-expression. Silencing of GADD45γ, a negative regulator of cell growth, is most likely responsible for conferring a selective growth advantage during tumour evolution and outgrowth."

https://openalex.org/W2001026481,"Maspin, SCCA1/2 and hurpin were identified by cDNA microarray analyses as dramatically differentially expressed transcripts in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These sequences are located within a 10-gene serpin cluster on 18q21.3. Using comparative RT-PCR, we have investigated the expression of each of these serpins, including their flanking loci, in an independent NSCLC series. Whereas six of the genes (maspin, SCCA1, SCCA2, hurpin, megsin and pAI-2) were commonly differentially expressed in primary lesions, each significantly more often in squamous cell tumours, maspin was identified as the most frequently over-represented sequence in both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Using a well-characterized monoclonal antibody, we have shown strong maspin expression in tumour protein extracts, detected multiple isoforms of the 42 kDa protein and shown that maspin is localized specifically to the tumour cells within neoplastic lesions. In contrast, most cells in non-neoplastic lung tissue appear not to express the gene, with the exception of the multipotent basal epithelial cells that line the bronchial airway. These reserve cells generally show strong predominantly nuclear localization of maspin. Strong nuclear expression of maspin within primary tumour cells is correlated with increased survival (P=0.05) and a longer remission duration (P=0.02) in resectable-staged patients. However, within the airways of cancer patients and somewhat in contrast to this observation, such expression was more frequently detected in the superficial cells of preneoplastic over non-neoplastic epithelia (P<0.0001), consistent with a role for the protein in early neoplasia."

https://openalex.org/W2084082671,"Ionizing radiations (IR) exposure leads to damage on several cellular targets. How signals from different targets are integrated to determine the cell fate remains a controversial issue. Understanding the pathway(s) responsible(s) for the cell killing effect of the IR exposure is of prime importance in light of using radiations as anticancer agent or as diagnostic tool. In this study, we have established that IR-induced cell damage initiates two independent signaling pathways that lead to a biphasic intracellular ceramide increase. A transitory increase of ceramide is observed within minutes after IR exposure as a consequence of DNA damage-independent acid sphingomyelinase activation. Several hours after irradiation, a second wave of ceramide accumulation is observed depending on the DNA damage-dependent activation of ceramide synthase, which requires a signaling pathway involving ATM. Importantly, we have demonstrated that the late ceramide accumulation is also dependent on the first one and is rate limiting for the apoptotic process induced by IR. In conclusion, our observations suggest that ceramide is a major determinant of the IR-induced apoptotic process at the cross-point of different signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2110719217,"We investigated the antitumor effects of FR901228, a HDAC inhibitor, on human osteosarcoma cells, in vitro and in vivo to explore its possible utility in the treatment of pediatric bone cancers. FR901228 caused marked growth inhibition with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 1.2–7.3 nM and induction of apoptosis in all eight osteosarcoma cell lines tested. These effects of FR901228 were also observed in vivo xenograft models on BALB/c nude mice, and treatment with 5.6 mg/kg/day resulting in a >70% reduction in the mean final tumor volume compared with the mean initial tumor volume. TUNEL assays demonstrated extensive apoptosis in tumor sections of mice treated with FR901228. Induction of apoptosis was preceded by increased expression of Fas ligand (FasL) mRNA, resulting in expression of membrane-bound FasL, which was followed by sequential activation of caspase-8 and -3. The level of apoptosis induction was reduced using a neutralizing anti-FasL antibody and overexpression of either the dominant-negative FADD or the viral FLICE inhibitory protein. Furthermore, treatment with a suboptimal dose of FR901228 greatly sensitized osteosarcoma cells to agonistic anti-Fas antibody-mediated apoptosis. These findings suggest that FR901228 is a highly promising antitumor agent against osteosarcoma, inducing apoptosis by the activation of the Fas/FasL system."
https://openalex.org/W2007767413,"In a previous study, we reported that overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) in mouse epidermis results in epidermal hyperplasia, hypertrophy and severe dermal fibrosis. In this study, we have investigated the susceptibility to skin tumor formation by forced expression of CDK4. Skin tumors from transgenic mice showed a dramatic increase in the rate of malignant progression to squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in an initiation-promotion protocol. Histopathological analysis of papillomas from transgenic mice showed an elevated number of premalignant lesions characterized by dysplasia and marked atypia. Interestingly, transgenic mice also developed tumors in initiated but not promoted skin, demonstrating that CDK4 replaced the action of tumor promoters. These results suggest that expression of cyclin D1 upon ras activation synergizes with CDK4 overexpression. However, cyclin D1 transgenic mice and double transgenic mice for cyclin D1 and CDK4 did not show increased malignant progression in comparison to CDK4 transgenic mice. Biochemical analysis of tumors showed that CDK4 sequesters the CDK2 inhibitors p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, suggesting that indirect activation of CDK2 plays an important role in tumor development. These results indicate that, contrary to the general assumption, the catalytic subunit, CDK4, has higher oncogenic activity than cyclin D1, revealing a potential use of CDK4 as therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W2131831158,"Herceptin is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against the extracellular domain of the HER2 oncogene, which is amplified and overexpressed in 10–34% of breast cancers. Herceptin therapy provides effective treatment in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, although a favorable treatment response is not achieved in all cases. Here, we show that Herceptin treatment induces a dose-dependent growth reduction in breast cancer cell lines with HER2 amplification, whereas nonamplified cell lines are practically resistant. Time-course analysis of global gene expression patterns in amplified and nonamplified cell lines indicated a major change in transcript levels between 24 and 48 h of Herceptin treatment. A step-wise gene selection algorithm revealed a set of 439 genes whose temporal expression profiles differed most between the amplified and nonamplified cell lines. The discriminatory power of these genes was confirmed by both hierarchical clustering and self-organizing map analyses. In the amplified cell lines, the Herceptin treatment induced the expression of several genes involved in RNA processing and DNA repair, while cell adhesion mediators and known oncogenes, such as c-FOS and c-KIT, were downregulated. These results provide additional clues to the downstream effects of blocking the HER2 pathway in breast cancer and may provide new targets for more effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1967495346,"tr-kit is a truncated form of the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit expressed in the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. Upon microinjection, tr-kit triggers metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mouse eggs by the sequential activation of Fyn and PLCγ1. Here, we show that tr-kit promotes the interaction of several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with the SH3 domain of PLCγ1. Western blot analysis indicates that one of these proteins is Sam68, an RNA-binding protein that is known to interact with and be phosphorylated by Src-like kinases in mitosis. tr-kit promotes the association of Sam68 with PLCγ1 and Fyn in a multimolecular complex, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of the phosphorylated forms of these proteins using antibodies directed to anyone of the partners of the complex. Expression of tr-kit potentiates the interaction of endogenous Sam68 also with the SH3 domain of Fyn. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of Sam68 is affected by tr-kit through activation of Fyn in live cells. Lastly, we show that interaction with the SH3 domain of Fyn triggers the release of Sam68 from bound RNA. Thus, our data suggest that tr-kit promotes the formation of a multimolecular complex composed of Fyn, PLCγ1 and Sam68, which allows phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by Fyn, and may modulate RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2032215961,"Calicheamicin ϑII is a member of the enediyne class of antitumor antibiotics that bind to DNA and induce apoptosis. These compounds differ, however, from conventional anticancer drugs as they bind in a sequence-specific manner noncovalently to DNA and cause sequence-selective oxidation of deoxyriboses and bending of the DNA helix. Calicheamicin is clinically employed as immunoconjugate to antibodies directed against, for example, CD33 in the case of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Here, we show by the use of the unconjugated drug that calicheamicin-induced apoptosis is independent from death-receptor/FADD-mediated signals. Moreover, calicheamicin triggers apoptosis in a p53-independent manner as shown by the use of p53 knockout cells. Cell death proceeds via activation of mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-9 and -3. The overexpression of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 strongly inhibited calicheamicin-induced apoptosis. Knockout of Bax abrogated cell death after calicheamicin treatment. Thus, the activation of mitochondria and execution of cell death occur through a fully Bax-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, caspase inhibition by the pancaspase-inhibitor zVAD-fmk interfered with mitochondrial activation by calicheamicin. This places caspase activation upstream of the mitochondria and indicates that calicheamicin-triggered apoptosis is enhanced through death receptor-independent activation of the caspase cascade, that is, an amplification loop that is required for full activation of the mitochondrial pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2092967426,"Previous studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have shown a high frequency of allelic loss on chromosome 13q, infrequent somatic mutations in BRCA2, and a suggested association between a positive family history (FH+) of upper gastrointestinal cancer and germline BRCA2 mutations. In all, 70 ESCC patients (44 FH+ and 26 FH-) were examined by direct full sequencing of germline DNA for BRCA2 mutations. In addition, 28 family members of three of these patients and 232 unrelated healthy blood bank donor controls were examined for the mutations identified in the 70 ESCC patients. Five BRCA2 germline mutations, including three not previously reported (N1600del, A2054P, and V2109I), were identified in six of 44 FH+ patients, but none of 26 FH- patients (14 vs 0%, P=0.078), consistent with our previous findings (3/34 or 9% FH+ vs 0/22 or 0% FH-, P=0.27). The cumulative frequency of BRCA2 germline mutations in ESCC patients in this and our previous study combined is 12%, with all mutations found in FH+ as opposed to FH- cases (9/78 or 12% FH+ vs 0/48 or 0% FH-, P=0.013). We conclude that germline mutations in BRCA2 in ESCC patients from this high-risk area of China are more frequent in FH+ than FH- cases, suggesting that BRCA2 may play a role in genetic susceptibility to familial ESCC."

https://openalex.org/W2080543032,"Growth factors and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling cooperate to play essential roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumor progression in mouse reproductive organs. Treatment of neonatal mice with diethylstilbestrol (DES) induces an estrogen-independent persistent proliferation and cornification of the vaginal epithelium, which results in cancerous lesions later in life. However, the mechanisms of the estrogen-dependent and -independent pathways essentially remain unknown. We characterized the expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors (EGF, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC), amphiregulin (APR), epiregulin (EPR) and neuregulin (NRG) 1) and erbB receptors (EGF receptor (EGFR), erbB2/neu, erbB3 and erbB4) in the vaginae of mice treated either neonatally (0-4 day) or as adults (55-59 day) with estrogens. EGFR and erbB2 were activated in the vaginal epithelium of mice by estrogen treatment. This activation was also encountered in vaginae from neonatally DES-exposed mice, along with the expression of EGF, TGF-alpha, HB-EGF, BTC, APR, EPR and NRG1. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that erbB2 was primarily expressed in vaginal epithelium. Finally, we found that serine 118 and 167 located in the AF-1 domain of ERalpha were phosphorylated in these vaginae. AG825, AG1478 or ICI 182,780 administration blocked proliferation of vaginal epithelium induced by neonatal DES exposure. Thus, signal transduction via EGFR and erbB2 could be related to the estrogen-induced vaginal changes and persistent erbBs phosphorylation and sustained expression of EGF-like growth factors, leading to ERalpha activation that may result in cancerous lesions in vaginae from neonatally DES-exposed mice later in life."

https://openalex.org/W2010552470,"HIPK2 shows overlapping localization with p53 in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and functionally interacts with p53 to increase gene expression. Here we demonstrate that HIPK2 and the PML-NB resident protein Sp100 synergize for the activation of p53-dependent gene expression. Sp100 and HIPK2 interact and partially colocalize in PML-NBs. The cooperation of HIPK2 and Sp100 for the induction of p21(Waf1) is completely dependent on the presence of p53 and the kinase function of HIPK2. Downregulation of Sp100 levels by expression of siRNA does not interfere with p53-mediated transcription, but obviates the enhancing effect of HIPK2. In summary, these experiments reveal a novel function for Sp100 as a coactivator for HIPK2-mediated p53 activation."
https://openalex.org/W1992567564,"Bloom's syndrome (BS) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with an elevated incidence of cancers. The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a RecQ helicase family member. BS cells exhibit genomic instability, including excessive homologous recombination and chromosomal aberrations. We reported previously that BS cells also demonstrate increased error-prone nonhomologous endjoining, which could contribute to genomic instability in these cells. Here, we show that BS cells display an abnormality in the timing of replication of both early-replicating genes and late-replicating loci such as chromosomal fragile sites. This delayed replication is associated with a constitutively increased frequency of sites of DNA damage and repair, as determined by the presence of DNA repair factors such as RAD51 and Ku86. In addition, another RecQ family helicase, WRN, also localizes to these repair sites. The presence of these repair sites correlates with the temporal appearance of cyclin B1 expression, indicative of the cells having progressed beyond mid-S phase in the cell division cycle. Critically, these defects in BS cells are the direct result of loss of BLM function, because BS cells phenotypically 'reverted' following transfection with the BLM cDNA no longer show such defects. Thus, our data indicate that constitutive DNA damage is coupled to delayed DNA replication in BS cells."

https://openalex.org/W1984157944,"Germ-line mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, when they lead to a truncated protein, confer a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. However, the role of BRCA1 missense mutations in cancer predisposition is unclear. Functional assays may be very helpful to more clearly define the biological effect of these mutations, and could therefore be useful in clinical practice. A recent study using a Host Cell End-Joining assay showed that a truncating mutation results in impaired fidelity of DSB repair by DNA end-joining. In the present study, we examined the fidelity of DSB repair in four lymphoblastoid cell lines with BRCA1 missense mutations. The fidelity of DNA end-joining was impaired in the four cell lines studied compared to the normal control cell line. The fidelity of end-joining was similar to that of a truncated mutation control cell line for one cell line and slightly higher for the other cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2010406049,"We found that human melanoma SEKI and neuroepithelioma NAGAI cells, which are known to secrete high concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), also secrete high levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We therefore examined the role of LIF in HGF expression and examined the human HGF promoter. The expression of both LIF and HGF mRNA is very low in HEK293 cells. Treatment of these cells with LIF stimulated the expression of HGF mRNA. The cis-acting regulatory element of the HGF promoter in SEKI and 293 cells was analysed by means of a transient expression assay. By deletion analysis, we showed that the region comprising the -181 to -73 bp was required for full activity of the HGF promoter in SEKI cells and for LIF responsiveness of 293 cells. This region contains putative consensus sequences for the Stat and NF-IL6 (C/EBP beta) transcription factors. The activity of the HGF promoter was abolished by mutation of the Stat site at -99/-91, while the activity only slightly decreased on mutation of the NF-IL6 site. Treatment with anti-LIF antibodies or interruption of Stat3 signaling by dominant-negative Stat3 also reduced the HGF promoter activity. Stat3 activation was constitutive in SEKI cells and induced on treatment of 293 cells with LIF. These results suggest that cytokines, growth factors and oncogenes (v-Src, etc.) that activate Stat3 are important regulators of HGF expression."
https://openalex.org/W2165618814,"Appendiceal adenocarcinomas are uncommon, and the genetic alterations present in these tumors are not well characterized. We studied genetic alterations including loss of chromosome 18q (location of DCC, DPC4, and JV-18 genes), and mutations of the DPC4 (SMAD4) and beta-catenin genes in 28 appendiceal adenocarcinomas, consisting of 17 mucinous and 11 nonmucinous carcinomas. Chromosome 18q loss was present in 57% (12/21) of appendiceal carcinomas including 54% (7/13) of mucinous and 63% (5/8) of nonmucinous carcinomas. Mutation of the DPC4 gene was present in 14% (three of 22) of the carcinomas occurring in one tumor with chromosome 18q loss and in two with unassessed chromosome 18q status. beta-catenin gene mutation was present in 0% (0 of 25) of the carcinomas. Chromosome 18q loss status was not associated with any clinicopathological features. The presence of chromosome 18q loss and DPC4 mutations in appendiceal adenocarcinomas suggests involvement of DPC4 and nearby genes on chromosome 18q (DCC and/or JV-18) in the pathogenesis of appendiceal adenocarcinomas."

https://openalex.org/W1971124096,"There has been a considerable debate as to whether caspase-2 is an initiator or effector caspase. Recently, a new model of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis has been proposed, which suggests caspase-2 to be an initiator caspase. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UV) and other DNA damage-inducing agents were shown to first activate caspase-2 and then regulate the mitochondrial and postmitochondrial events. Active caspase-2 was found to engage mitochondria by promoting Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Consequently, Bax was proposed to play a central role in bridging the active caspase-2 with mitochondria by affecting mitochondrial permeability, cytochrome c release into the cytosol and caspase-9 activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of Bax in UV-induced apoptosis and caspase-2 activation. Our results indicate that UV-induced apoptosis and caspase-2 activation were diminished in Bax-deficient cells, suggesting that Bax appears to play an important role in UV-induced apoptosis as well as caspase-2 activation, and that it also appears to reside upstream of caspase-2. Bax deficiency also affected the activation of caspase-3 and -8 and abolished caspase-9 activation during UV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the absence of caspase-9 activation may affect caspase-2, -3 and -8 activation in Bax-deficient cells. Based on our results, we propose that activation of caspases is not a linear cascade of events, but is rather connected via complex feedback loops."

https://openalex.org/W2090442303,"TrkA is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for nerve growth factor (NGF) and stimulates NGF-dependent cell survival and differentiation in primary neurons and also differentiation of neuroblastomas and apoptosis of medulloblastomas. We have previously shown that aspartic acid and glutamic acid substitution (AspGlu and GluAsp) of the activation loop tyrosines in TrkA (Tyr(683) and Tyr(684)) supports NGF-independent neuritogenesis and cell survival in PC12 cell-derived nnr5 cells. In this study, the AspGlu and GluAsp mutant Trks have been analysed for their ability to support NGF-independent and NGF-dependent neuritogenesis, proliferation and cell signalling in the human neuroblastoma cell line, SY5Y. We find that the AspGlu and GluAsp mutant Trks support NGF-dependent, but not NGF-independent, autophosphorylation, neuritogenic responses and/or inhibit cell cycle progression. The NGF-dependent neuritogenic responses are lower for the mutant Trks (approximately 30-60% for AspGlu and 50-60% for GluAsp), relative to wild-type TrkA. While both the AspGlu and GluAsp mutant Trks support NGF-dependent transient phosphorylation of Shc, PLCgamma-1, AKT, FRS2, SH2B as well as prolonged MAP kinase activation, the GluAsp mutant induces stronger NGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2 and SH2B, as well as a stronger reduction in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Collectively, these data suggest that neither absolute levels of receptor autophosphorylation, high levels of TrkA expression nor the activation of a specific signalling pathway is dominant and absolutely essential for neuritogenesis and cell cycle arrest of SY5Y cells."
https://openalex.org/W2112455486,"Radioresistance markedly impairs the efficacy of tumor radiotherapy and may involve antiapoptotic signal transduction pathways that prevent radiation-induced cell death. A common cellular response to genotoxic stress induced by radiation is the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). NF-κB activation in turn can lead to an inhibition of radiation-induced apoptotic cell death. Thus, inhibition of NF-κB activation is commonly regarded as an important strategy to abolish radioresistance. Among other compounds, the fungal metabolite gliotoxin (GT) has been reported to be a highly selective inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Indeed, low doses of GT were sufficient to significantly enhance radiation-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. However, this effect turned out to be largely independent of NF-κB activation since radiation of HL-60 cells with clinically relevant doses of radiation induced only a marginal increase in NF-κB activity, and selective inhibition of NF-κB by SN50 did not result in a marked enhancement of GT-induced apoptosis. GT induced activation of JNKs, cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and potently stimulated the caspase cascade inducing cleavage of caspases −9, −8, −7 and −3. Furthermore, cleavage of the antiapoptotic protein X-linked IAP and downregulation of the G2/M-specific IAP-family member survivin were observed during GT-induced apoptosis. Finally, the radiation-induced G2/M arrest was markedly reduced in GT-treated cells most likely due to the rapid induction of apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that various other pathways apart from the NF-κB signaling complex can sensitize tumor cells to radiation and propose a novel mechanism for radiosensitization by GT, the interference with the G2/M checkpoint that is important for repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in p53-deficient tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967311473,"Receptor crosstalk is an emerging and recurrent theme in cytokine and growth factor signaling; however, insight into the mechanism(s) underlying these interactions remains limited. Recently, we reported that crosstalk occurs between ErbB3 and the interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) signaling complex in the myeloma cell line KAS-6/1 and that this crosstalk contributes to the regulation of cell proliferation. In this study, we examined the mechanism underlying the transactivation of ErbB3 in the IFN-alpha growth-responsive KAS-6/1 cells. The examination of IFN-alpha receptor 1 and 2 (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) levels revealed that the KAS-6/1 cell line overexpresses IFNAR1 relative to other myeloma cell lines that are growth arrested by IFN-alpha. Subsequent investigation of Tyk2, which is constitutively associated with IFNAR1, demonstrated that Tyk2 activation is uniquely sustained in the KAS-6/1 cell line following IFN-alpha stimulation. Interestingly, silencing of Tyk2 expression via siRNA resulted in attenuation of ErbB3 transactivation. However, inhibition of Jak1 expression also decreased IFN-alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB3. Finally, siRNA downregulation of Tyk2 and Jak1 was found to decrease IFN-alpha-stimulated proliferation. These findings validate our previous report of ErbB3 involvement in IFN-alpha-induced proliferation and further suggest that both Janus kinase members, Tyk2 and Jak1, play a role in the transactivation of ErbB3 in this model system."

Since inappropriate activation of cytokine signaling cascades is a recurring theme in human leukemia, we performed expression screens to identify genes that transform cytokine-dependent cells. Using retroviral cDNA libraries derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with myeloproliferative disorders, we isolated numerous genes that genetically complement cytokine requirements for proliferation of BaF/3 and TF-1 cells. The majority of recovered genes represent members of the kinase family, including several previously linked to leukemogenesis. Our unbiased screen highlights the central role of kinase activation in hematopoietic cell proliferation and identifies a number of potential leukemic oncoproteins."
