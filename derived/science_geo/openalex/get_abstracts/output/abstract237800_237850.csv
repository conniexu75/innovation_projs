https://openalex.org/W2012451546,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen persisting within phagosomes through interference with phagolysosome biogenesis. Here we show that stimulation of autophagic pathways in macrophages causes mycobacterial phagosomes to mature into phagolysosomes. Physiological induction of autophagy or its pharmacological stimulation by rapamycin resulted in mycobacterial phagosome colocalization with the autophagy effector LC3, an elongation factor in autophagosome formation. Autophagy stimulation increased phagosomal colocalization with Beclin-1, a subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPS34, necessary for autophagy and a target for mycobacterial phagosome maturation arrest. Induction of autophagy suppressed intracellular survival of mycobacteria. IFN-γ induced autophagy in macrophages, and so did transfection with LRG-47, an effector of IFN-γ required for antimycobacterial action. These findings demonstrate that autophagic pathways can overcome the trafficking block imposed by M. tuberculosis. Autophagy, which is a hormonally, developmentally, and, as shown here, immunologically regulated process, represents an underappreciated innate defense mechanism for control of intracellular pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W2045085957,"The proper intracellular distribution of mitochondria is assumed to be critical for normal physiology of neuronal cells, but direct evidence for this idea is lacking. Extension or movement of mitochondria into dendritic protrusions correlates with the development and morphological plasticity of spines. Molecular manipulations of dynamin-like GTPases Drp1 and OPA1 that reduce dendritic mitochondria content lead to loss of synapses and dendritic spines, whereas increasing dendritic mitochondrial content or mitochondrial activity enhances the number and plasticity of spines and synapses. Thus, the dendritic distribution of mitochondria is essential and limiting for the support of synapses. Reciprocally, synaptic activity modulates the motility and fusion/fission balance of mitochondria and controls mitochondrial distribution in dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2079852484,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly altered in human tumors, predominantly through missense mutations that result in accumulation of mutant p53 protein. These mutations may confer dominant-negative or gain-of-function properties to p53. To ascertain the physiological effects of p53 point mutation, the structural mutant p53R172H and the contact mutant p53R270H (codons 175 and 273 in humans) were engineered into the endogenous p53 locus in mice. p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice are models of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome; they developed allele-specific tumor spectra distinct from p53+/− mice. In addition, p53R270H/− and p53R172H/− mice developed novel tumors compared to p53−/− mice, including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors. Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in primary cells derived from p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice. These results demonstrate that point mutant p53 alleles expressed under physiological control have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond the simple loss of p53 function."
https://openalex.org/W2034882416,"Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome carry inherited mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and are predisposed to tumor development. To examine the mechanistic nature of these p53 missense mutations, we generated mice harboring a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 515 of p53 (p53+/515A) corresponding to the p53R175H hot spot mutation in human cancers. Although p53+/515A mice display a similar tumor spectrum and survival curve as p53+/− mice, tumors from p53+/515A mice metastasized with high frequency. Correspondingly, the embryonic fibroblasts from the p53515A/515A mutant mice displayed enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation potential. The disruption of p63 and p73 in p53−/− cells increased transformation capacity and reinitiated DNA synthesis to levels observed in p53515A/515A cells. Additionally, p63 and p73 were functionally inactivated in p53515A cells. These results provide in vivo validation for the gain-of-function properties of certain p53 missense mutations and suggest a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2017994898,"Nutrient availability regulates life-span in a wide range of organisms. We demonstrate that in mammalian cells, acute nutrient withdrawal simultaneously augments expression of the SIRT1 deacetylase and activates the Forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a. Knockdown of Foxo3a expression inhibited the starvation-induced increase in SIRT1 expression. Stimulation of SIRT1 transcription by Foxo3a was mediated through two p53 binding sites present in the SIRT1 promoter, and a nutrient-sensitive physical interaction was observed between Foxo3a and p53. SIRT1 expression was not induced in starved p53-deficient mice. Thus, in mammalian cells, p53, Foxo3a, and SIRT1, three proteins separately implicated in aging, constitute a nutrient-sensing pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2038921819,"Exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are cis-regulatory elements that inhibit the use of adjacent splice sites, often contributing to alternative splicing (AS). To systematically identify ESSs, an in vivo splicing reporter system was developed to screen a library of random decanucleotides. The screen yielded 141 ESS decamers, 133 of which were unique. The silencer activity of over a dozen of these sequences was also confirmed in a heterologous exon/intron context and in a second cell type. Of the unique ESS decamers, most could be clustered into groups to yield seven putative ESS motifs, some resembling known motifs bound by hnRNPs H and A1. Potential roles of ESSs in constitutive splicing were explored using an algorithm, ExonScan, which simulates splicing based on known or putative splicing-related motifs. ExonScan and related bioinformatic analyses suggest that these ESS motifs play important roles in suppression of pseudoexons, in splice site definition, and in AS."
https://openalex.org/W2036477200,"The budding yeast INO80 complex is a conserved ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler containing actin-related proteins Arp5 and Arp8. Strains lacking INO80, ARP5, or ARP8 have defects in transcription. Here we show that these mutants are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents and to double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the HO endonuclease. The checkpoint response and most transcriptional modulation associated with induction of DNA damage are unaffected by these mutations. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we show that Ino80, Arp5, and Arp8 are recruited to an HO-induced DSB, where a phosphorylated form of H2A accumulates. Recruitment of Ino80 is compromised in cells lacking the H2A phosphoacceptor S129. Finally, we demonstrate that conversion of the DSB into ssDNA is compromised in arp8 and H2A mutants, which are both deficient for INO80 activity at the site of damage. These results implicate INO80-mediated chromatin remodeling directly at DSBs, where it appears to facilitate processing of the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2102604046,"While the role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in transcription is well established, a link between chromatin remodeling and DNA repair has remained elusive. We have found that the evolutionarily conserved INO80 chromatin remodeling complex directly participates in the repair of a double-strand break (DSB) in yeast. The INO80 complex is recruited to a HO endonuclease-induced DSB through a specific interaction with the DNA damage-induced phosphorylated histone H2A (gamma-H2AX). This interaction requires Nhp10, an HMG-like subunit of the INO80 complex. The loss of Nhp10 or gamma-H2AX results in reduced INO80 recruitment to the DSB. Finally, components of the INO80 complex show synthetic genetic interactions with the RAD52 DNA repair pathway, the main pathway for DSB repair in yeast. Our findings reveal a new role of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in nuclear processes and suggest that an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex can read a DNA repair histone code."
https://openalex.org/W2140395780,"Period (Per) genes are involved in regulation of the circadian clock and are thought to modulate several brain functions. We demonstrate that Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice, which have a deletion in the PAS domain of the Per2 protein, show alterations in the glutamatergic system. Lowered expression of the glutamate transporter Eaat1 is observed in these animals, leading to reduced uptake of glutamate by astrocytes. As a consequence, glutamate levels increase in the extracellular space of Per2(Brdm1) mutant mouse brains. This is accompanied by increased alcohol intake in these animals. In humans, variations of the PER2 gene are associated with regulation of alcohol consumption. Acamprosate, a drug used to prevent craving and relapse in alcoholic patients is thought to act by dampening a hyper-glutamatergic state. This drug reduced augmented glutamate levels and normalized increased alcohol consumption in Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice. Collectively, these data establish glutamate as a link between dysfunction of the circadian clock gene Per2 and enhanced alcohol intake."
https://openalex.org/W2015735754,"RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast requires the RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex and a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Rdp1). Here we show that Rdp1 is associated with two conserved proteins, Hrr1, an RNA helicase, and Cid12, a member of the polyA polymerase family, in a complex that has RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (RDRC, RNA-directed RNA polymerase complex). RDRC physically interacts with RITS in a manner that requires the Dicer ribonuclease (Dcr1) and the Clr4 histone methyltransferase. Moreover, both complexes are localized to the nucleus and associate with noncoding centromeric RNAs in a Dcr1-dependent manner. In cells lacking Rdp1, Hrr1, or Cid12, RITS complexes are devoid of siRNAs and fail to localize to centromeric DNA repeats to initiate heterochromatin assembly. These findings reveal a physical and functional link between Rdp1 and RITS and suggest that noncoding RNAs provide a platform for siRNA-dependent localization of RNAi complexes to specific chromosome regions."
https://openalex.org/W2160073632,"PARP-1 is the most abundantly expressed member of a family of proteins that catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose units from NAD+ to target proteins. Herein, we describe previously uncharacterized nucleosome binding properties of PARP-1 that promote the formation of compact, transcriptionally repressed chromatin structures. PARP-1 binds in a specific manner to nucleosomes and modulates chromatin structure through NAD+-dependent automodification, without modifying core histones or promoting the disassembly of nucleosomes. The automodification activity of PARP-1 is potently stimulated by nucleosomes, causing the release of PARP-1 from chromatin. The NAD+-dependent activities of PARP-1 are reversed by PARG, a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, and are inhibited by ATP. In vivo, PARP-1 incorporation is associated with transcriptionally repressed chromatin domains that are spatially distinct from both histone H1-repressed domains and actively transcribed regions. Thus, PARP-1 functions both as a structural component of chromatin and a modulator of chromatin structure through its intrinsic enzymatic activity."

Olig2 is necessary for the specification of oligodendrocytes, but the biological functions of Olig1 during oligodendrocyte lineage development are poorly understood. We show here that Olig1 function in mice is required not to develop the brain but to repair it. Specifically, we demonstrate a genetic requirement for Olig1 in repairing the types of lesions that occur in patients with multiple sclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2073825741,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is characterized by 11q13 chromosomal translocation and CCND1 overexpression, but additional genomic changes are also important for lymphomagenesis. To identify the genomic aberrations of MCL at higher resolutions, we analysed 29 patient samples and seven cell lines using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) consisting of 2348 artificial chromosome clones, which cover the whole genome at a 1.3 mega base resolution. The incidence of identified genomic aberrations was generally higher than that determined with chromosomal CGH. The most frequent imbalances detected by array CGH were gains of chromosomes 3q26 (48%), 7p21 (34%), 6p25 (24%), 8q24 (24%), 10p12 (21%) and 17q23 (17%), and losses of chromosomes 2p11 (83%), 11q22 (59%), 13q21 (55%), 1p21-p22 (52%), 13q34 (52%), 9q22 (45%), 17p13 (45%), 9p21 (41%), 9p24 (41%), 6q23-q24 (38%), 1p36 (31%), 8p23 (34%), 10p14 (31%), 19p13 (28%), 5q21 (21%), 22q12 (21%), 1q42 (17%) and 2q13 (17%). Our analyses also detected several novel recurrent regions of loss located at 1p36, 1q42.2-q43, 2p11.2, 2q13, 17p13.3 and 19p13.2-p13.3, as well as recurrent regions of homozygous loss such as 2p11 (Ig(kappa)), 2q13 and 9p21.3-p24.1 (INK4a/ARF). Of the latter, we investigated the 2q13 loss, which led to identification of homozygous deletions of the proapoptotic gene BIM. The high-resolution array CGH technology allowed for the precise identification of genomic aberrations and identification of BIM as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene in MCL."

Although implicated in various biologic functions, their molecular sites of action have not been clarified. Using radiolabeled IP 7 , we detected phosphorylation of multiple eukaryotic proteins. We also observed phosphorylation of endogenous proteins by endogenous IP 7 in yeast. Phosphorylation by IP 7 is nonenzymatic and may represent a novel intracellular signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2144925860,"Switching specific patterns of gene repression and activation in response to precise temporal/spatial signals is critical for normal development. Here we report a pathway in which induction of CaMKIIdelta triggers an unexpected switch in the function of the HES1 transcription factor from a TLE-dependent repressor to an activator required for neuronal differentiation. These events are based on activation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP-1) sensor component of the groucho/TLE-corepressor complex mediating dismissal of the corepressor complex from HES1-regulated promoters. In parallel, CaMKIIdelta mediates a required phosphorylation of HES1 to permit neurogenic gene activation, revealing the ability of a specific signaling pathway to modulate both the derepression and the subsequent coactivator recruitment events required for transcriptional activation of a neurogenic program. The identification of PARP-1 as a regulated promoter-specific exchange factor required for activation of specific neurogenic gene programs is likely to be prototypic of similar molecular mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1982496758,"Breast cancer progression is likely a multistep process involving the activation and inactivation of a number of genes. Previously, we showed that the mRNA coding for Fra-1, a FOS family member and an AP-1 transcription factor component, was highly expressed in the more invasive estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer cell lines. We used a tet-off system to stably overexpress Fra-1 in MCF7 ER+ cells and evaluate the impact of Fra-1 on this aggressive phenotype. Conversely, Fra-1 was silenced in highly invasive ER-MDA-MB231 cells using RNA interference. We report that in both systems the Fra-1 expression level was positively associated with cell proliferation, cell motility and invasiveness assessed in vitro. In addition, Fra-1 inhibition in fibroblastoid ER- cells, which formed colonies with large stellate projections in Matrigel, resulted in morphological changes. Cells acquired an epithelioid shape and had a spherical appearance in Matrigel. Fra-1 regulated several genes, implicated in invasion, angiogenesis and cell proliferation independently of beta1-integrin activation, and directly induced MMP-1 and MMP-9 promoter activity. These overall results show that high Fra-1 expression is associated with a more malignant cell phenotype and suggest that Fra-1 could have a pivotal role in breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2098323528,"A variety of lipid and lipid-derived molecules can modulate TRP cation channel activity, but the identity of the lipids that affect TRP channel function in vivo is unknown. Here, we use genetic and behavioral analysis in the nematode C. elegans to implicate a subset of 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in TRPV channel-dependent olfactory and nociceptive behaviors. Olfactory and nociceptive TRPV signaling are sustained by overlapping but nonidentical sets of 20-carbon PUFAs including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and arachidonic acid (AA). PUFAs act upstream of TRPV family channels in sensory transduction. Short-term dietary supplementation with PUFAs can rescue PUFA biosynthetic mutants, and exogenous PUFAs elicit rapid TRPV-dependent calcium transients in sensory neurons, bypassing the normal requirement for PUFA synthesis. These results suggest that a subset of PUFAs with omega-3 and omega-6 acyl groups act as endogenous modulators of TRPV signal transduction."

However, the key features of retinal waves that drive this refinement are controversial. Some manipulations of retinal waves lead to normal eye-specific segregation but others do not. By comparing retinal spiking patterns in several mutant mice with differing levels of eye-specific segregation, we show that the presence of high-frequency bursts synchronized across neighboring retinal ganglion cells correlates with robust eye-specific segregation and that the presence of high levels of asynchronous spikes does not inhibit this segregation. These findings provide a possible resolution to previously described discrepancies regarding the role of retinal waves in retinogeniculate segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2038255814,"Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication has long been considered to occur by asymmetric synthesis of the two strands, starting at the multiple origins of the strand-displacement loop (D-loop). We report the discovery of a major replication origin at position 57 in the D-loop of several human cell lines (HeLa, A549, and 143B.TK-) and immortalized lymphocytes. The nascent chains starting at this origin, in contrast to those initiated at the previously described origins, do not terminate prematurely at the 3' end of the D-loop but proceed well beyond this control point, behaving as ""true"" replicating strands. This origin is mainly responsible for mtDNA maintenance under steady-state conditions, whereas mtDNA synthesis from the formerly identified D-loop origins may be more important for recovery after mtDNA depletion and for accelerating mtDNA replication in response to physiological demands."

https://openalex.org/W1974580422,"Pharmacological activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) have been shown to inhibit growth of lung tumors largely through growth inhibition and induction of apopotosis. However, since many of these agents engage other effectors, the role of PPARγ in lung tumorigenesis remains poorly defined. To specifically examine PPARγ-mediated events, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells overexpressing PPARγ were established. Overexpression of PPARγ in H2122 adenocarcinoma cells (H2122-PPARγ) blocked anchorage-independent growth compared to cells transfected with empty vector (H2122-LNCX), but had no significant effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis under standard tissue culture conditions. Orthotopic implantation of H2122-PPARγ cells into the lungs of nude rats inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and prolonged survival compared to implantation of H2122-LNCX cells. Consistent with these findings, H2122-PPARγ cells had an impaired invasiveness as assessed in Transwell assays. In a three-dimensional culture system, H2122-PPARγ cells formed polarized spheroid structures similar to those observed with normal lung epithelial cells. H2122-LNCX cells formed nonpolarized aggregate structures and did not show any of these epithelial properties. These data indicate that inhibitory effects of PPARγ on lung tumorigenesis involve selective inhibition of invasive metastasis, and activation of pathways that promote a more differentiated epithelial phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2047383934,"Chk1 is the major mediator in the activation of cell-cycle checkpoints in response to a variety of genotoxic stresses. We have previously shown that inhibition of Chk1 sensitizes tumor cells to topoisomerase inhibitors such as camptothecin and doxorubicin through abrogation of cell-cycle arrest (S or G2/M checkpoints). However, it was not clear whether inhibition of Chk1 could potentiate antimetabolites, a mainstay of cancer therapy, which confer genotoxic stress through a different mechanism than topoisomerase inhibitors. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most widely used antimetabolite in the treatment of colorectal, breast and other major types of cancers. Here we demonstrate that 5-FU activates Chk1 and induces an early S-phase arrest. Chk1 downregulation abrogates this arrest and dramatically sensitizes tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of 5-FU. 5-FU confers S-phase arrest through Chk1-mediated Cdc25A proteolysis leading to inhibition of Cdk2. Chk1 elimination stabilizes the Cdc25A protein and results in the abrogation of the S checkpoint and resumption of DNA synthesis, which leads to excessive accumulation of double-stranded DNA breaks. As a result, downregulation of Chk1 potentiates 5-FU efficacy through induction of premature chromosomal condensation followed by apoptosis. Interestingly, the profiles of various cell-cycle markers indicate that cells progress to early M phase to induce apoptosis after checkpoint abrogation. Yet, cells fail to increase their DNA content to 4N as revealed by FACS analysis, probably due to the dramatic induction of double-stranded DNA breaks and chromosomal fragmentation. This is significantly different from the cell-cycle profiles observed in the potentiation of topoisomerase inhibitors by Chk1 siRNA, which showed mitotic progression with 4N DNA content leading to mitotic catastrophe after abrogation of the S or G2 checkpoint. Thus, our results illustrate a novel mode of checkpoint abrogation and cell death conferred by Chk1 inhibition. Additionally, we show that Chk1 deficiency potentiates 5-FU efficacy through the preferential induction of the caspase-8 pathway and subsequent caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, we have clearly demonstrated that inhibition of Chk1 not only potentiates the toxicity of conventional DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, but also enhances the toxicity of antimetabolites in cancer cell lines. This discovery reveals novel scope of checkpoint abrogation and will significantly broaden the potential application of Chk1 inhibitors in cancer therapy if they do not potentiate the toxicity of 5-FU in normal cells."

https://openalex.org/W2015135169,"Accumulated evidence suggests that Parp-1 is involved in DNA repair processes, including base excision repair, single-strand and double-strand break repairs. To understand the precise role of Parp-1 in genomic stability in vivo, we carried out mutation analysis using Parp-1 knockout (Parp-1−/−) mice harboring two marker genes, gpt and red/gam genes. Spontaneous mutant frequencies of both genes in the bone marrows and livers did not differ significantly between Parp-1−/− and Parp-1+/+ mice (P>0.05). After treatment with an alkylating agent, N-nitrosobis(2-hydroxypropyl)amine (BHP), the mutant frequency of the red/gam genes in the liver in Parp-1−/− mice was 1.6-fold higher than that in Parp-1+/+ mice (P<0.05). Categorization of the mutations revealed that deletions larger than 1 kb or those accompanying 1–5 bp insertions at the deletion junctions, as well as rearrangements, were more frequently observed in Parp-1−/− than in Parp-1+/+ mice (P<0.05, respectively). In contrast, mutant frequencies of the gpt gene in the livers of Parp-1−/− and Parp-1+/+ mice after BHP treatment were both elevated and there was no significant difference between the genotypes. These results indicate that Parp-1 is implicated in suppressing deletion mutations in vivo, especially those accompanying small insertions or rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W2067511583,"Significant progress has been made to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that determine thyroid tumor development and progression. However, most investigations have mainly focused on the genetic alterations of nuclear DNA. The potential role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in thyroid tumorigenesis is not well defined. In the present study, we investigated the frequency of mtDNA mutations in 24 thyroid tumor specimens (19 primary papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), one follicular thyroid carcinoma, and four multinodular hyperplasias) and four thyroid cancer cell lines by sequencing the entire coding regions of mitochondrial genome. Among the 19 PTC samples tested, seven (36.8%) had somatic mutations. Somatic mtDNA mutations were also detected in one of four multinodular hyperplasias examined. All the thyroid tumor cell lines carried sequence variations that change amino acid and have not been reported previously as normal sequence variants. Flow cytometry analysis of mitochondria respiratory function in the thyroid tumor cell lines revealed a severe defect in mitochondrial complex I activity. The majority of the mutations was involved in genes located in the complex I of the mitochondrial genome. The mutations were either A → G or C → T transitions, often resulting in a change of a moderately or highly conserved amino acid of their corresponding protein. These data suggest that mtDNA mutations may play an important role in the thyroid tumorigenesis. Given that mtDNA mutation is present in the benign multinodular hyperplasia, it might be involved in the early stage of tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W1967408167,"In renal cell carcinomas (RCC), NF-κB blockade is required for maximal bortezomib-induced apoptosis, and expression of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein downregulates NF-κB. Thus, we hypothesized that expression of wild-type (wt) VHL sensitizes RCC cells to bortezomib by reducing constitutive NF-κB activity. Using isogenic paired cell lines with and without expression of wtVHL, we have confirmed that VHL expression reduces constitutive NF-κB activity. Moreover, VHL expression confers markedly heightened sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of bortezomib in vitro. The bortezomib IC50 values were greater than two logs lower in the VHL-expressing cell lines compared to the VHL-deficient counterparts. By manipulating the level of constitutive NF-κB activity in an isogenic pair of RCC cell lines independently of VHL expression, we were able to demonstrate that the VHL sensitization effect is due to downregulation of NF-κB activity. These findings offer the enticing possibility of using VHL status as a molecular marker to identify RCC patients who may be sensitive to bortezomib. In particular, RCC patients who have non-clear-cell histologies as well as approximately 25% of clear-cell RCCs manifest expression of wtVHL and represent a subpopulation of patients that is apt to respond to bortezomib."

To determine if p27 deficiency alters Cx32-influenced tumorigenesis, we have generated a Cx32/p27 double-deficient mouse strain (DKO) and show here that exposure of these mice to X-ray radiation resulted in an increase or decrease in tumorigenesis depending on the tissue. Several tissues were highly sensitive to loss of p27 tumor suppressor function (intestine, adrenal, pituitary) resulting in an increased overall tumor burden in DKO mice compared to both wild-type (P<0.005) and Cx32-KO mice (P=0.066). However, additional deletion of p27 in a Cx32-KO background resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the liver tumor incidence suggesting that Cx32 and p27 pathways mechanistically interact. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an increased percentage of Cx32-KO liver and lung tumors harboring active mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk1, Erk2) pathways in contrast to lower percentages of activated wild-type (P<0.005) and DKO tumors (P=0.027). Increased MAPK activation in liver tumors did not correlate with Ha-ras codon-61 mutation status. This study demonstrates that tissues dependent on Cx32 tumor suppression, such as the liver and lung, exhibit altered tumorigenesis and tumor biology (MAPK pathway activation) related to p27 status."
https://openalex.org/W1965800022,"Downregulation of the cellular retinol-binding protein-I (CRBP-I) occurs in breast and other human cancers, but its significance is not well understood. Recently, we showed that restoration of CRBP-I expression in transformed MTSV1-7 breast epithelial cells increased retinoic receptor activity, inhibited anoikis, promoted acinar differentiation and inhibited tumorigenicity, suggesting that CRBP-I suppresses tumor progression. However, the mechanism underlying these effects of CRBP-I was not elucidated. Here we demonstrate, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, that CRBP-I inhibits, in a retinoic acid receptor-dependent manner, the PI3K/Akt survival pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt was necessary and sufficient to explain the antitumor effects of CRBP-I and was mediated by decreased p85 regulatory and p110 catalytic subunit heterodimerization. We present evidence consistent with the idea that this effect is due to CRBP-I inhibition of p85 phosphorylation at Y688. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of PI3K regulation at the level of p85–p110 heterodimerization. These findings lead us to hypothesize that CRBP-I downregulation in cancer promotes tumor progression through inhibition of retinoic acid receptor activity and derepression of PI3K/Akt signaling via a novel mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2094949391,"Overexpression of membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in tumor cells has previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis. To establish if MT1-MMP is also able to confer tumorigenicity on nonmalignant epithelial cells, we transfected human MT1-MMP cDNA into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing a tetracycline-repressible transactivator. Induction of MT1-MMP in the absence of doxycycline (Dox) was associated with activation of exogenous MMP-2 as well as with formation of large cysts and increased invasiveness in collagen matrices. Transfected cells were inoculated subcutaneously into two groups of nude mice, one of which received Dox to inhibit expression of MT1-MMP. Formation of tumor xenografts was observed in 11 of 17 mice maintained without Dox, but only in two of nine mice that received Dox (P<0.05). The xenografts were composed of tubular structures interspersed within a highly cellular stroma. The epithelial cells delimiting the lumen were polarized, as indicated by the basolateral distribution of Na,K-ATPase. Despite their differentiated appearance, the tumors lacked a well-defined boundary, and epithelial tubules invaded adjacent muscular layers. These results demonstrate that conditional expression of MT1-MMP in nonmalignant MDCK epithelial cells is by itself sufficient to drive formation of invasive tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1992694867,"Alfalfa mosaic virus genomic RNAs are infectious only when the viral coat protein binds to the RNA 3' termini. The crystal structure of an alfalfa mosaic virus RNA-peptide complex reveals that conserved AUGC repeats and Pro-Thr-x-Arg-Ser-x-x-Tyr coat protein amino acids cofold upon interacting. Alternating AUGC residues have opposite orientation, and they base pair in different adjacent duplexes. Localized RNA backbone reversals stabilized by arginine-guanine interactions place the adenosines and guanines in reverse order in the duplex. The results suggest that a uniform, organized 3' conformation, similar to that found on viral RNAs with transfer RNA-like ends, may be essential for replication."

Here we show that telomere shortening in telomerase knockout (mTERC−/−) mice in combination with chronic liver damage significantly reduced organismal survival even though telomere shortening strongly inhibited liver tumor formation. Decreased survival induced by telomere shortening correlated with an imbalance between liver cell proliferation and liver cell apoptosis. Specific changes in gene expression were associated with telomere shortening and chronic liver damage and these gene expression changes were partially reversed by adenovirus mediated telomerase gene delivery. This study gives experimental evidence that the negative impact of telomere shortening on organ homeostasis and organismal survival can surpass the beneficial effects of telomere shortening on suppression of tumor growth in the setting of chronic organ damage."
