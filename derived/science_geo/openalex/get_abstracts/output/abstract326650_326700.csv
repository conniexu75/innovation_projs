https://openalex.org/W2063907348,"Chemiluminescence is reported from chemical species produced during electrolysis of aromatic hydrocarbons in deoxygenated nonaqueous solvents. Emission occurs in the solution near the cathode, and the emitting species is the excited singlet state of the hydrocarbon. Oxygen exerts a severe quenching effect on the chemiluminescence. Possible mechanisms are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1975370801,"Planktonic foraminiferal tests show bilamellar additions to each chamber and develop a ""secondary thickening"" in the form of a calcite crust in late ontogeny. The evidence presented indicates that additional calcium carbonate is deposited upon the original bilamellar test and that maximum calcite crust thickness is attained at depths greater than 500 meters."

https://openalex.org/W2089784397,"Preliminary tests indicate that ocean water may release an abundance of ice nuclei to the atmosphere. These results may explain the observation that marked anomalies often accompany an influx of marine air in the Washington, D. C., area and the fact that abnormal counts are often associated with widespread precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W1991199995,Isolated teeth of multituberculates have been found in association with late Eocene fossil mammals. Previous studies reported that multituberculates were not found in deposits younger than early Eocene age (Graybull provincial substage or equivalents). This newly found occurrence indicates that these animals are more likely to be late Eocene in age than reworked early Eocene materials.

https://openalex.org/W4245966417,"Discovery of hematite and kaolinite in excavations of late paleolithic occupation sites at Les Eyzies (Dordogne), France, raises anew the question of the nature of the paint used by paleolithic people. Hematite as a pigment source is widely documented, but the presence of kaolinite imported into prehistoric sites poses problems. The suggestion is made that white clay might have been used as an ""extender pigment"" to mix with colors such as that derived from hematite."

The duration of the occultation was 11 minutes, 4.4 seconds, and mid-occultation occurred at 14 hours, 25 minutes, 9 seconds U.T. Over 600 individual photographs, which define the relative positions of Venus and Regulus, were obtained."
