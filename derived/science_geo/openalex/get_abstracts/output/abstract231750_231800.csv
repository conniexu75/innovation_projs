https://openalex.org/W2060610551,"The quiescent state is thought to be an indispensable property for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Interaction of HSCs with their particular microenvironments, known as the stem cell niches, is critical for adult hematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM). Here, we demonstrate that HSCs expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 are quiescent and antiapoptotic, and comprise a side-population (SP) of HSCs, which adhere to osteoblasts (OBs) in the BM niche. The interaction of Tie2 with its ligand Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) induced cobblestone formation of HSCs in vitro and maintained in vivo long-term repopulating activity of HSCs. Furthermore, Ang-1 enhanced the ability of HSCs to become quiescent and induced adhesion to bone, resulting in protection of the HSC compartment from myelosuppressive stress. These data suggest that the Tie2/Ang-1 signaling pathway plays a critical role in the maintenance of HSCs in a quiescent state in the BM niche."

P450 3A4 catalyzes the metabolic clearance of a large number of clinically used drugs, and a number of adverse drug-drug interactions reflect the inhibition or induction of the enzyme. P450 3A4 exhibits a relatively large substrate-binding cavity that is consistent with its capacity to oxidize bulky substrates such as cyclosporin, statins, taxanes, and macrolide antibiotics. Family 3A P450s also exhibit unusual kinetic characteristics that suggest simultaneous occupancy by smaller substrates. Although the active site volume is similar to that of P450 2C8 (PDB code: 1PQ2), the shape of the active site cavity differs considerably due to differences in the folding and packing of portions of the protein that form the cavity. Compared with P450 2C8, the active site cavity of 3A4 is much larger near the heme iron. The lower constraints on the motions of small substrates near the site of oxygen activation may diminish the efficiency of substrate oxidation, which may, in turn, be improved by space restrictions imposed by the presence of a second substrate molecule. The structure of P450 3A4 should facilitate a better understanding of the substrate selectivity of the enzyme. The structure of P450 3A4 was determined by x-ray crystallography to 2.05-Å resolution.

Yamazaki H. Mimura M. Inui Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 414-423PubMed Google Scholar) and broad capacity to oxidize structurally diverse substrates (2Li A.P. Kaminski D.L.

The enzyme also provides a significant barrier to the bioavailability of new drug candidates contributing to attrition from the developmental pipeline. Additionally, metabolic drug-drug interactions between substrates and inhibitors of the enzyme can profoundly affect the safety or efficacy of drug therapy (4Tanaka E. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 23: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Wilkinson G.R. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that microsomal P450s could be crystallized for structural determination by x-ray crystallography when the proteins were modified for expression as conditional membrane proteins (6Cosme J.

Cell. 2000; 5: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). As a result, structures for P450s in family 2, subfamilies B and C are now available (8Schoch G.A.

P450s of family 3, subfamily A exhibit less than 40% amino acid sequence identity with family 2 P450s. In addition, family 3 P450s often exhibit complex kinetic properties such as substrate and effector activation. Effectors or alternative substrates can modulate the apparent binding affinity for other inhibitors (15Johnson E.F. Schwab G.E. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17672-17677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and substrates (16Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6636-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are a number of examples where alternative substrates fail to inhibit the oxidation of specific substrates leading to kinetic models based on the occupancy of the substrate-binding cavity by two substrates that each can be oxidized by the reactive, hypervalent oxy-perferryl heme intermediate without interference from the other (17Korzekwa K.R. Krishnamachary N. Shou M. Ogai A. Parise R.A. Rettie A.E. Gonzalez F.J. Tracy T.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4137-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Shou M. Grogan J. Mancewicz J.A. Krausz K.W. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Korzekwa K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The observation that P450 3A4 oxidizes some of the largest substrates identified for P450s, such as cyclosporin, bromocryptine, and macrolide antibiotics (3Rendic S. Di Carlo F.J. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 413-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar), has generally suggested the likelihood that the active site cavity of the enzyme is relatively large compared with other P450s. A large active site cavity would also be consistent with models where two or more molecules of smaller substrates are postulated to simultaneously occupy the active site cavity potentially altering the dissociation constant for substrate binding and/or catalytic efficiency by constraining the substrate close to the reactive oxygen intermediate during catalysis. The structure of human microsomal P450 3A4 described in this report exhibits a relatively large substrate-binding cavity that is consistent with these notions regarding the enzyme. Of the structures determined previously for family 2 P450s, 3A4 is most similar to that of P450 2C8 (PDB code: 1PQ2) that also oxidizes relatively large substrates and exhibits a large active site cavity. However, the two enzymes differ considerably in the architectures of their active sites in ways that are likely to correspond to the unusual kinetic properties of P450 3A4. Protein Expression and Purification—The pSE3A4His expression plasmid (19Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5396-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was obtained from James Halpert (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) for the expression of P450 3A4 with a C-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli. The plasmid was modified to express P450 3A4 without the trans-membrane leader sequence of the microsomal protein, amino acid residues 3–23, to improve its solubility and facilitate crystallization. No other mutations were employed. The resulting construct, pSE3A4dH, was transformed into E. coli strain, DH5α. The expression and purification of P450 3A4dH closely follows the protocols described previously for P450 2C5dH that employed metal ion affinity chromatography followed by CM-Sepharose chromatography (20Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast to P450 2C5dH, which is largely dissociated from membranes by high salt buffers, about 80% of 3A4dH is found in the membrane fraction of high salt lysates. For this reason, P450 3A4dH was solubilized using 0.4% (w/v) of CHAPS (Calbiochem). CYMAL6 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH) was exchanged for CHAPS during subsequent chromatography procedures, and the buffers used during purification procedures were supplemented with 0.4 mm erythromycin (Sigma). The purified protein was concentrated for crystallization to 0.3 mm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.4 mm erythromycin, and 20% glycerol using a centrifugal membrane-concentrating device with a 50-kDa cutoff (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The protein exhibited a molecular weight of 55,778 when analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectrometry at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectroscopy, which is close to the predicted value of 55,526. Spectral Binding Studies—Substrate binding to the purified protein was assayed by monitoring the conversion of the heme prosthetic group from a low spin to a high spin state spectrophotometrically as described (21Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Purified protein was diluted to 0.8–1.0 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol in a 1-cm path length microcuvette. Aliquots of either 7,8-benzoflavone or testosterone dissolved in methanol were added to the solution, and the differences in the absorption between 394 and 418 nm were recorded. The apparent binding constant was estimated as described previously (22Jung F. Griffin K.J. Song W. Richardson T.H. Yang M. Johnson E.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16270-16279Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results confirmed that the purified protein retained its capacity to bind testosterone and 7,8-benzoflavone with the same dissociation constant as P450 3A4 expressed from the pSE3A4HIS plasmid in E. coli, 16 μm. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops against a well solution of 6% PEG 5000 MME, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.4 mm erythromycin. The drop consisted of 0.4 μl of 3A4dH protein solution, 0.1 μl of 40 mm CHAPS, and 1.25 μl of well solution and was covered with a layer of paraffin oil after combining the components. Single crystals were prepared for data collection by sequential 60-s soaks in 5.6% PEG 5000 MME, 0.04 m HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 20 and 30% ethylene glycol, respectively. The crystal was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen before placing it in the cryo-stream for data collection. The initial structure of P450 3A4dH was solved by the MAD of the native iron of the heme prosthetic group of the enzyme using data collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory Beamline 9-2. CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar) was used for MAD phasing, solvent flattening, and density modification to produce the initial electron density maps. The initial maps from the MAD phasing provided a trace for almost all of the main chain as well as significant information regarding the larger side chains. Subsequent phase combination and extension allowed the initial model to be built and refined using CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). The final model was built and refined using a high resolution data set obtained for a crystal diffracting to 2.0 Å at the Advanced Light Source Beamline 5.0.2. The model encompasses residues His-28 to Thr-499, where the numbering corresponds to that of the wild-type enzyme, and exhibits R and Rfree values of 0.24 and 0.29, respectively. An external loop between helices H and I, residues 282–285, could not be modeled. This is likely to reflect the flexibility of this region, which is not constrained by crystal contacts. Similarly, 6 residues at the N terminus and 8 residues at the C terminus of the truncated and His-tagged protein used for crystallization were not visible. A statistical analysis of the data, the final refinement statistics, and stereochemical analysis of the model are given in supplemental Table I. Automated Docking of Erythromycin in the Structure—Computer-based automated docking of erythromycin A into the active site of P450 3A4 was performed using a grid based docking program, AUTODOCK 3.05 (24Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar), with a modified genetic search algorithm employing a local minimum refinement. A 58 × 72 × 70-point grid with a spacing of 0.375 Å centered at –21.6, –22.7, –11.9 Å was used for a protein model. Coordinates for the initial model of erythromycin A were obtained from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Base. The most significant differences between the overall structure of P450 3A4 and other P450s are seen for the helix D to H and the helix B to C regions (Fig. 1A). The structure is most similar to the structures of mammalian family 2 P450s, which exhibit less than 40% sequence identity with P450 3A4. Eukaryotic P450s, including 3A4, exhibit longer sequences between helices F and G that generally exhibit two additional helices, F′ and G′. This region is thought to form a membrane interaction domain (7Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), and as seen in family 2 P450s, the outer surfaces of helices F′ and G′ are hydrophobic. 2C8 was chosen for comparison in Fig. 1B because it shares a capacity with 3A4 to oxidize relatively large substrates such as taxanes and statins. The solvent-accessible surfaces of the active site cavities are rendered as a mesh in Fig. 1, A–C. The cavities of 2C8 and 3A4 exhibit similar volumes of 1438 Å3 (8Schoch G.A. Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9497-9503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and 1386 Å3, respectively, when truncated at the narrowest constrictions of the solvent channels. The shapes of the cavities differ in ways that are likely to affect substrate selectivity and enzyme catalysis, and this, in turn, reflects differences in the secondary and tertiary structure of the proteins. The structure of 3A4 is much more open in the vicinity of the heme iron, and the cavity volume is more uniformly distributed than the sinuous cavity of 2C8. The larger volume of the active site in the vicinity of the heme iron when compared with 2C8 reflects changes in the conformation of the protein in the SRS5 region as it passes from helix K to strand β1–4 as well as structural differences in the SRS2 and SRS3 regions that pass above the heme (Fig. 1, C and D). A large cavity extends outward along the surface of sheet β-1 under helix F′ where a relatively large solvent channel to the surface exits between sheet β-1, the end of helix F′ and SRS1 (Fig. 1, A and C). Arg-106 extends across one edge of the channel and participates in a hydrogen-bonding network formed by Arg-106, Glu-374, Asp-76, Arg-372, Asp-61 and Tyr-53 that is stabilized by charge interactions (Fig. 1E). A smaller solvent channel exits the active site cavity on the other side of residues 106–108. In contrast to the structures of family 2 P450s, helices F and G do not pass over the active site cavity in 3A4 (Fig. 1, A and B) because these helices are shorter. Residues 209–217 and 237–242 that connect the F and G helices to helices F′ and G′ form the roof of the active site cavity, are part of SRS2 and SRS3, respectively, and do not exhibit a regular secondary structure (Fig. 1D). A third solvent channel exits the active site cavity under the SRS2 region between SRS4 and SRS6. Several phenylalanine residues that include Phe-108, Phe-213, Phe-215, Phe-241, and Phe-304 contribute to the packing that closes the roof of the active site above the heme between the SRS1, SRS2, SRS3, and SRS4 regions. Interestingly, the reported mutations L211F and D214E located on the outer edge of the SRS2 region above the third solvent channel alter the homotropic cooperativity exhibited by 3A4 catalyzed steroid hydroxylations and confer a hyperbolic dependence on substrate concentration (16Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6636-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This effect was thought to arise from a reduction of the active site volume due to the increased volume occupied by the side chains of the mutated residues. These residues are not directly in the active site of the structure determined here, and it is difficult to predict how these mutations would affect protein conformation. Mutations to additional residues in this region, such as Leu-210, Phe-213, and Phe-215, that form the roof of the active site have also been shown to alter the cooperativity exhibited by the enzyme (19Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5396-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Domanski T.L. He Y.A. Khan K.K. Roussel F. Wang Q. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10150-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We suspect that the atypical structure of the region forming the roof of the active site cavity could accommodate the simultaneous binding of multiple substrate molecules because of its flexibility. Although erythromycin was present during crystallization of the protein, 2|Fo|– |Fc| (where Fo indicates the observed structure factor, and Fc indicates the calculated structure factor) electron density maps did not confirm its presence in the crystallized protein. Erythromycin occupancy of the crystallized protein may have been reduced by its limited solubility in the crystallization buffer, nonspecific binding to micelles of the detergent CHAPS, extraction into the solutions used to protect the crystal during freezing, or extraction of erythromycin into the paraffin oil that was used to reduce the rate of vapor phase equilibration during crystallization. Automated docking studies using the model indicated that the active site cavity was sufficiently large to accommodate the substrate in an orientation that positioned the dimethylamino group of the amino sugar appropriately for oxidation (Fig. 1E) without altering the positions of any amino acids. The figure also displays several amino acid side chains that line the active site cavity and that contact the docked erythromycin molecule. The residues shown in Fig. 1E include residues 119, 301, 304, 305, 369, 370, and 374 that have been implicated as active site residues by site directed mutagenesis studies (26He Y.A. Roussel F. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Domanski T.L. He Y.A. Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 585-591PubMed Google Scholar, 28Roussel F. Khan K.K. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Fowler S.M. Riley R.J. Pritchard M.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Friedberg T. Wolf C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4406-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Fowler S.M. Taylor J.M. Friedberg T. Wolf C.R. Riley R.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2002; 30: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Another unusual feature of P450 3A4 is the presence of Arg-212 in the active site cavity. The side chain is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Phe-304, a residue that has also been implicated in the cooperativity of the enzyme (25Domanski T.L. He Y.A. Khan K.K. Roussel F. Wang Q. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10150-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), as well as to a hydrogen-bonding network that includes a cluster of waters above the heme (Fig. 1F). In this position, the backbone of residues 211 and 212 would potentially disrupt the putative proton transfer pathway between the conserved residues, Glu-308 and Thr-309, on helix I. Glu-308 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide of Arg-212. Repositioning of the peptide bond between the conserved acidic residue, Glu-308, and the conserved threonine, Thr-309, is thought to position a water molecule for proton transfer to the reduced oxygen intermediates bound to the heme iron leading to the cleavage of the dioxygen bond to form a water molecule and the highly reactive perferryloxo heme intermediate that oxidizes the substrate (31Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). A reduction in proton transfer can lead to increased lifetimes for the peroxy and hydroperoxy anionic intermediates that can also oxidize substrates (33Newcomb M. Aebisher D. Shen R. Chandrasena R.E. Hollenberg P.F. Coon M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6064-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This could contribute to the P450 3A4-catalyzed conversion of the cyano moiety of pinacidil to an amide group, which had been attributed to nucleophilic oxidation by the hydroperoxy anion intermediate (34Zhang Z. Li Y. Stearns R.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Baillie T.A. Tang W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2712-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure of the enzyme suggests that the side chain of Arg-212 could easily reorient to reside outside the active site cavity, and characterization of the R212A mutant indicated that the substitution had little affect on testosterone hydroxylation or its stimulation by 7,8-benzoflavone (19Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5396-5402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Substrate binding could influence the orientation of the Arg-212 side chain. In the docked model for erythromycin binding, Arg-212 hydrogen bonds to heteroatoms of the sugar moieties of the substrate (Fig. 1E). Docking studies also indicate that there is sufficient space in the active site cavity for simultaneous occupancy by 7,8-benzoflavone and testosterone in several possible combinations of locations (data not shown). Basic residues are conserved at alignment position 212 of family 3 P450s, and it is interesting to speculate that these basic residues could influence peroxide-supported substrate oxidation by providing general base catalysis of peroxide cleavage as occurs for a bacterial P450 fatty acid alpha hydroxylase (35Lee D.S. Yamada A. Matsunaga I. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting to note that family 3A enzymes exhibit relatively high ratios of heterolysis to homolysis of peroxyquinols (36Correia M.A. Yao K. Allentoff A.J. Wrighton S.A. Thompson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and that the basic residue 212 could contribute to heterolysis by general base-assisted catalysis. In summary, the structure of 3A4 exhibits a relatively large substrate-binding cavity that is consistent with the sizes of substrates that are oxidized by the enzyme. In addition, the relatively large size of the active site cavity near the catalytic center of the enzyme may contribute to heterotropic cooperativity by facilitating alternative binding modes for multiple substrate molecules. The large size of the cavity reflects significant differences in the conformations of SRS1, SRS2, and SRS5 regions in 3A4 relative to family 2 P450s. Mutations in the SRS2 region, which is not helical in 3A4, generally alter homo- and heterotropic kinetics linking the unusual conformation of the enzyme in this region to characteristic aspects of 3A4 function. The presence of a basic residue, Arg-212, in the active site was unanticipated, and its potential role in peroxide-supported oxidations catalyzed by 3A4 deserves further experimental investigation. The help of the staff at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, particularly Michael Soltis and Paul Ellis, and at the Advanced Light Source is greatly appreciated.

https://openalex.org/W2145039217,"Most people acquire literacy skills with remarkable ease, even though the human brain is not evolutionarily adapted to this relatively new cultural phenomenon. Associations between letters and speech sounds form the basis of reading in alphabetic scripts. We investigated the functional neuroanatomy of the integration of letters and speech sounds using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Letters and speech sounds were presented unimodally and bimodally in congruent or incongruent combinations. Analysis of single-subject data and group data aligned on the basis of individual cortical anatomy revealed that letters and speech sounds are integrated in heteromodal superior temporal cortex. Interestingly, responses to speech sounds in a modality-specific region of the early auditory cortex were modified by simultaneously presented letters. These results suggest that efficient processing of culturally defined associations between letters and speech sounds relies on neural mechanisms similar to those naturally evolved for integrating audiovisual speech."

https://openalex.org/W2161888572,"Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP, DYT12) is a distinctive autosomal-dominant movement disorder with variable expressivity and reduced penetrance characterized by abrupt onset of dystonia, usually accompanied by signs of parkinsonism. The sudden onset of symptoms over hours to a few weeks, often associated with physical or emotional stress, suggests a trigger initiating a nervous system insult resulting in permanent neurologic disability. We report the finding of six missense mutations in the gene for the Na+/K+-ATPase α3 subunit (ATP1A3) in seven unrelated families with RDP. Functional studies and structural analysis of the protein suggest that these mutations impair enzyme activity or stability. This finding implicates the Na+/K+ pump, a crucial protein responsible for the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane, in dystonia and parkinsonism."

https://openalex.org/W2142922236,"Axons dictate whether or not they will become myelinated in both the central and peripheral nervous systems by providing signals that direct the development of myelinating glia. Here we identify the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) as a potent regulator of the axonal signals that control myelination of TrkA-expressing dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGs). Unexpectedly, these NGF-regulated axonal signals have opposite effects on peripheral and central myelination, promoting myelination by Schwann cells but reducing myelination by oligodendrocytes. These findings indicate a novel role for growth factors in regulating the receptivity of axons to myelination and reveal that different axonal signals control central and peripheral myelination."
https://openalex.org/W2092759474,"Removal of synaptic AMPA receptors is important for synaptic depression. Here, we characterize the roles of individual subunits in the inducible redistribution of AMPA receptors from the cell surface to intracellular compartments in cultured hippocampal neurons. The intracellular accumulation of GluR2 and GluR3 but not GluR1 is enhanced by AMPA, NMDA, or synaptic activity. After AMPA-induced internalization, homomeric GluR2 enters the recycling pathway, but following NMDA, GluR2 is diverted to late endosomes/lysosomes. In contrast, GluR1 remains in the recycling pathway, and GluR3 is targeted to lysosomes regardless of NMDA receptor activation. Interaction with NSF plays a role in regulated lysosomal targeting of GluR2. GluR1/GluR2 heteromeric receptors behave like GluR2 homomers, and endogenous AMPA receptors show differential activity-dependent sorting similar to homomeric GluR2. Thus, GluR2 is a key subunit that controls recycling and degradation of AMPA receptors after internalization."

https://openalex.org/W2071973373,"The genes of the ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABR) subunits have shown an unusual chromosomal clustering, but only now can this be fully specified by analyses of the human genome. We have characterized the genes encoding the 18 known human GABR subunits, plus one now located here, for their precise locations, sizes, and exon/intron structures. Clusters of 17 of the 19, distributed between five chromosomes, are specified in detail, and their possible significance is considered. By applying search algorithms designed to recognize sequences of all known GABR-type subunits in species from man down to nematodes, we found no new GABR subunit is detectable in the human genome. However, the sequence of the human orthologue of the rat GABR ρ3 receptor subunit was uncovered by these algorithms, and its gene could be analyzed. Consistent with those search results, orthologues of the β4 and γ4 subunits from the chicken, not cloned from mammals, were not detectable in the human genome by specific searches for them. The relationships are consistent with the mammalian θ subunit being derived from the β line and ϵ from the γ line, with mammalian loss of β4 and γ4. In their structures the human GABR genes show a basic pattern of nine coding exons, with six different genomic mechanisms for the alternative splicing found in various subunits. Additional noncoding exons occur for certain subunits, which can be regulatory. A dicysteine loop and its exon show remarkable constancy between all GABR subunits and species, of deduced functional significance."
https://openalex.org/W1968432442,"We describe the isolation of mutations in dynamin-associated protein 160 kDa (dap160), the Drosophila homolog of intersectin, a putative adaptor for proteins involved in endocytosis, cytoskeletal regulation, and signaling. We show that partial loss-of-function mutants display temperature-sensitive (ts) paralysis, whereas null mutants show ts defects in endocytosis. Loss-of-function mutants exhibit bouton overgrowth at larval neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), but evoked neurotransmission is normal. Mutant NMJs show a mild endocytic defect at 22 degrees C, which is strongly enhanced at 34 degrees C. The levels of dynamin, synaptojanin and endophilin are severely reduced in dap160 mutant NMJs, suggesting that Dap160 serves to stabilize an endocytic macromolecular complex. Electron microscopy reveals fewer vesicles, aberrant large vesicles, and an accumulation of endocytic intermediates at active and periactive zones in mutant terminals. Our data suggest that Dap160, like dynamin, is involved in synaptic vesicle retrieval at active and periactive zones."

https://openalex.org/W2080240639,"Dap160/Intersectin is a multidomain adaptor protein that colocalizes with endocytic machinery in the periactive zone at the Drosophila NMJ. We have generated severe loss-of-function mutations that eliminate Dap160 protein from the NMJ. dap160 mutant synapses have decreased levels of essential endocytic proteins, including dynamin, endophilin, synaptojanin, and AP180, while other markers of the active zone and periactive zone are generally unaltered. Functional analyses demonstrate that dap160 mutant synapses are unable to sustain high-frequency transmitter release, show impaired FM4-64 loading, and show a dramatic increase in presynaptic quantal size consistent with defects in synaptic vesicle recycling. The dap160 mutant synapse is grossly malformed with abundant, highly ramified, small synaptic boutons. We present a model in which Dap160 scaffolds both endocytic machinery and essential synaptic signaling systems to the periactive zone to coordinately control structural and functional synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W2142830713,"Research suggests that psychostimulants can physiologically alter dopamine kinetics in the ventral striatum (VS) and psychologically enhance mood and attention. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we conducted a within-subject, double-blind, placebo (PLAC)-controlled study of the effects of oral dextroamphetamine (AMPH, 0.25 mg/kg) treatment on brain activity and affect during incentive processing. In two counterbalanced scanning sessions 60-180 min after ingesting AMPH or PLAC, 8 healthy volunteers played a game involving anticipation and receipt of monetary gains and losses. Group and volume of interest analyses suggested that by enhancing tonic over phasic activation, AMPH treatment ""equalized"" levels of VS activity and positive arousal during anticipation of both gain and loss. These findings suggest that therapeutic effects of amphetamine on incentive processing may involve reducing the difference between anticipation of gains and losses."
https://openalex.org/W2003006566,"Survivin and XIAP are members of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) family. They are upregulated in various malignancies. Inactivation of these molecules has resulted in chemosensitization. The purpose of this study was to determine whether inhibition of survivin, XIAP, or both enhances radiotherapy in a lung cancer model. Transient transfection of H460 cells with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against either molecule has specifically reduced their expression, by Western analysis. Results from 3-(4,5-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and clonogenic assays suggest that inhibition of survivin or XIAP greatly decreased cell survival following irradiation. A significantly increased number of apoptotic cells were detected when H460 cells were treated with either antisurvivin, anti-XIAP or both ASOs (P=0.03, 0.0003 and 0.01, respectively) plus irradiation. H460 xenografts that were treated with ASOs plus radiotherapy demonstrated growth delay beyond 15 days. Growth delay in the groups of combined treatment was greater than that in other groups. However, treatment with ASOs alone did not affect tumor growth delay in mice, but decreased the survival of H460 cells in culture. Antisense treatment did not cause any mortality or weight loss during the 32 days of study. These data suggest that inhibition of survivin or XIAP radiosensitizes H460 lung cancer cells by upregulating apoptosis and downregulating cell survival. Combination of radiotherapy and inhibition of survivin and XIAP through the antisense approach results in improved tumor control by radiotherapy in a mouse model of lung cancer."

Using a preferential looking technique with looming and receding visual and auditory stimuli, we examined the multisensory integration of looming stimuli by rhesus monkeys. We found a strong attentional preference for coincident visual and auditory looming but no analogous preference for coincident stimulus recession. Consistent with previous findings, the effect occurred only with tonal stimuli and not with broadband noise. The results suggest an evolved capacity to integrate multisensory looming objects."

https://openalex.org/W2020329223,"Chemoresistance is a major therapeutic problem and the current knowledge on cellular mechanisms involved is incomplete. In the present study, we have investigated the possible involvement of Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein (FLIP) in ovarian cancer resistance by comparing chemosensitive (OV2008) and chemoresistant (C13*) ovarian cancer cells treated with cisplatin in vitro, and/or transfected with FLIP sense cDNA or FLIP small interfering RNA (siRNA) and determining FLIP protein content, cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and apoptosis. Cisplatin significantly decreased FLIP protein level, induced cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in cisplatin-sensitive but not -resistant cells. While overexpression of FLIP-attenuated cisplatin-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and apoptosis in chemosensitive cells, downregulation of FLIP in chemoresistant cells by siRNA increased apoptosis induced by cisplatin. These results suggest that FLIP plays a significant role in the regulation of apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells and their sensitivity to cisplatin. This cell survival factor may be an important determinant in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer and may serve as a molecular target for the development of novel therapy for chemoresistant ovarian cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2069817483,"Brain function relies on specificity of synaptic connectivity patterns among different classes of neurons. Yet, the substrates of specificity in complex neuropil remain largely unknown. We search for imprints of specificity in the layout of axonal and dendritic arbors from the rat neocortex. An analysis of 3D reconstructions of pairs consisting of pyramidal cells (PCs) and GABAergic interneurons (GIs) revealed that the layout of GI axons is specific. This specificity is manifested in a relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of these axons, and correlations of their trajectories with the positions of postsynaptic neuron dendrites. Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually taking a relatively straight course through neuropil. However, wiring patterns among PCs hold a large potential for circuit remodeling and specificity through growth and retraction of dendritic spines. Our results define distinct class-specific rules in establishing synaptic connectivity, which could be crucial in formulating a canonical cortical circuit."
https://openalex.org/W1979801144,"Stimulation of glucose transport by insulin in cultured adipocytes through translocation of intracellular GLUT4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane has been suggested to require phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms. To test the involvement of a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway leading to activation of the TC10 GTPase, the putative intermediates CAP, c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and CrkII were selectively depleted in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using highly efficient small interfering (si) RNAs. Simultaneous depletion of the ubiquitination factors c-Cbl plus Cbl-b in cultured adipocytes had the expected effect of delaying dephosphorylation of EGF receptors upon removal of EGF. However, siRNA-mediated gene silencing of both Cbl isoforms or CAP or CrkII in these cells failed to attenuate insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport or Myc-tagged GLUT4-GFP translocation at either sub-maximal or maximal concentrations of insulin. The dose-response relationship for insulin stimulation of deoxyglucose transport in primary adipocytes derived from c-Cbl knock-out mice was also identical to insulin action on adipocytes from wild type mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CAP, Cbl iso-forms, and CrkII are not required components of insulin signaling to GLUT4 transporters.

Glucose homeostasis is a tightly controlled process in mammals, requiring rapid disposal of ingested glucose into muscle and adipose tissue during high caloric intake and enhanced production of glucose by liver and kidney during starvation (1Shepherd P.R. Kahn B.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Insulin is secreted during feeding and acts to stimulate the former process and inhibit the latter, thus maintaining appropriately low blood glucose concentrations (2Saltiel A.R. Kahn R.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3935) Google Scholar). Insulin action to enhance glucose transport into muscle and fat cells reflects its ability to cause translocation of intracellular GLUT4 glucose transporter proteins to the plasma membrane (3Cushman S.W.

The recycling of GLUT4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane occurs in the basal state as well but at a much slower rate, and insulin action markedly enhances the exocytic pathway while inhibiting endocytosis (5Bryant N.J.

Despite the clear dependence of GLUT4 regulation by insulin on PI-3 kinase activity, several lines of evidence have indicated that an exclusive PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway might be insufficient for glucose uptake in adipocytes. Thus, a membrane-permeant analog of the PI 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate failed to stimulate glucose up-take in cultured adipocytes in the absence of insulin (20Jiang T.

This pathway was proposed to be initiated by association of CAP and APS adaptor proteins with the insulin receptor, which in turn recruit c-Cbl and/or Cbl-b proteins that are then tyrosine-phosphorylated. Phosphotyrosine on Cbl was found to associate with the CrkII adaptor protein bound to the GTPase exchange factor C3G, leading to GTP/GDP exchange and activation of the TC10 GTPase (27Watson R.T.

We also analyzed primary adipocytes derived from c-Cbl knock-out mice to further validate our findings derived from RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Our results demonstrate that c-Cbl/Cbl-b, CAP, or CrkII can be depleted in cultured adipocytes without compromising stimulation of hexose transport or GLUT4 translocation by insulin.

Gene silencing efficiency and adipocyte function were assayed 48 h after electroporation (7–10 days after initiation of differentiation). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes were cotransfected with Myc-GLUT4-EGFP plasmid and c-Cbl+Cbl-b or scrambled siRNAs. 36 h after electroporation, adipocytes were serum-starved for another 12 h, stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min, washed, and immunostained for Myc epitope using mouse anti-Myc antibody (clone 910) and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and observed under IX70-inverted microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY). Adipocytes Stimulation—Thirty-six hours after electroporation with siRNA, 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes were serum-starved with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% BSA for another 12 h before being stimulated with 100 nm insulin or 50 nm EGF for the indicated times. The cells were then lysed, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the respective antibodies. 2-Deoxyglucose Uptake Assay—Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described (11Jiang Z. Zhou Q.L. Coleman K.A. Chounard M. Boese Q. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7569-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In brief, siRNA-transfected cells reseeded on 12-well plates were cultured for 48 h prior to 3-h starvation with Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were then stimulated with insulin for 25 min at 37 °C. Deoxyglucose uptake was initiated by addition of [1,2-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose to a final assay concentration of 100 μm for 5 min at 37 °C. Assays were terminated by four washes with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer Hepes buffer, and the cells were lysed with 0.4 ml of 1% Triton X-100, and 3H was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and subtracted from each determination to obtain specific uptake. The fold increase was calculated after normalizing the basal uptake in respective siRNA-transfected cells to one. Glucose Transport in Primary Adipocytes—Primary adipocytes were isolated from control and c-Cbl knock-out mice, a kind gift from H. Gu (35Naramura M. Kole H.K. Hu R.J. Gu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15547-15552Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), Laboratory of Immunology, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Rockville. MD. Glucose uptake assay in primary mouse adipocytes was carried out following the method of Tozzo and Kahn (36Tozzo F. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipose cells isolated from epididymal fat pads of four to five mice were incubated at 37 °C with constant shaking in a 4% suspension by volume (∼40,000 cells/500 μl) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with Hepes (20 mm), 2.5% BSA (fraction V), and 200 nm adenosine. Cells were treated in the absence (basal) or presence of 1, 10, or 100 nm insulin for 30 min in presence of U-[14C]glucose, and the reaction was terminated by adding stop solution containing 1 mm phloretin and 0.05 mm cytochalsin B and separating cells from the medium by spinning the suspension through dinonyl phthalate oil (Eastman Kodak Co.). Statistical Analysis—Comparison of data presented as mean ± S.E. was performed by Student's t test (unpaired), and differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Percent reduction of individual protein expression was measured by densitometric analysis and is presented as a mean of several independent experiments. siRNA-mediated CAP Depletion Inhibits Cbl Phosphorylation on Tyr700 but Not GLUT4 Regulation in 3T3-L1 Adiocytes—We initiated our studies by silencing the expression of CAP, a bifunctional Cbl-binding adaptor protein with three SH3 domains and a sorbin homology motif (37Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated a CAP mutant lacking these SH3 domains expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation by ∼50% (38Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One of two siRNAs we tested for inhibition of CAP expression (siRNA CAP76) caused a near total depletion of CAP, while another siRNA (CAP1018) and a scrambled control siRNA had no detectable effect on CAP protein expression (Fig. 1A). Using phospho-specific antibodies against Cbl, we next tested for the effect of CAP ablation on Cbl phosphorylation. Of the four principal tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Cbl, (Tyr371, Tyr731, Tyr700, Tyr774), phosphorylation of Tyr700 and Tyr774 have been shown to create docking sites for the SH2 domain of CrkII (39Reedquist K.A. Fukazawa T. Govindaswami R. Langdon W.Y. Shoelson S.E. Drucker B.J. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8435-8442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 40Dikic I. Szymkiewicz I. Soubeyran P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1805-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since insulin reportedly did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr774 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (29Jebailey L. Rudich A. Huang X. Ciano-Oliviera C. Kapas A. Klip A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we analyzed the phosphorylation status of Tyr700 both in control and CAP-ablated cells. Both un-stimulated and insulin stimulated adipocytes showed comparable phosphorylation as determined by phospho-specific antibody Tyr700(P). Little or no effect of insulin on Cbl phosphorylation at tyrosine 700 was also observed after 5 min of insulin stimulation (data not shown). However, phosphorylation of tyrosine 700 was found to be significantly diminished by siRNA-mediated depletion of CAP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, indicating a function for CAP in tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl (Fig. 1B). We also analyzed the effect of CAP ablation on deoxyglucose uptake in response to insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As evidenced in Fig. 1C, both control and CAP-depleted adipocytes showed similar deoxyglucose transport rates in the presence of either 1 or 100 nm insulin. This result indicates that neither the reduction of CAP expression nor the inhibition of Cbl phosphorylation on Tyr700 has a significant effect on insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake. GLUT4 Translocation Is Normal in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes Depleted of c-Cbl plus Cbl-b—We next studied the consequences of selective attenuation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b in 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Cbl proteins have been implicated in the regulation of endocytic trafficking of EGFR in a variety of cell types (41Lill N.L. Douillard P. Awwad R.A. Ota S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Miyake S. Meissner-Lula N. Hsu V.W. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 367-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 42Huang Y. Kim S.O. Jiang J. Frank S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18902-18913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Binding of EGF to EGFR dimerizes and activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activities of the receptor resulting in multiple tyrosine phosphorylations at sites within its cytoplasmic domain that in turn engage specific cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068 serves as a binding site for GRB2 (43Rojas M. Yao S.Y. Lin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27456-27461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation at tyrosine 1045 promotes binding of c-Cbl to the receptor (44Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). EGFR association with c-Cbl causes monoubiquitination of the receptor (45Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), which is then rapidly internalized through clathrin-coated pits, sorted through early endosomes, and ultimately degraded in lysosomes (46Jiang X. Sorkin A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Loss of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation has been reported to precede such receptor internalization (47Burke P. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To assure that Cbl depletion by our siRNA-based procedure has some biological consequence in these present studies, we used phospho-specific antibody against EGFR Tyr1068(P) to determine EGFR phosphorylation in control and Cbl-depleted 3T3-F442A cells. We also developed conditions where the two isoforms of Cbl (c-Cbl plus Cbl-b) could be depleted simultaneously using siRNA species directed to both. As evidenced in Fig. 2E, EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation at tyrosine 1068 persisted for 10 min in control cells, while upon attenuation of expression of c-Cbl plus Cbl-b proteins, EGFR Tyr1068 phosphorylation persisted even after 45 min of EGF stimulation. We then tested the effect of loss of both c-Cbl plus Cbl-b on insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport in 3T3-F442A adipocytes (data not shown) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). We achieved >95% attenuation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b expression (Fig. 2A); however, even this near total loss of c-Cbl and Cbl-b expression failed to modify insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose transport (Fig. 2D). In five independent experiments, Cbl-depleted 3T3-L1 adipocytes displayed comparable deoxyglucose transport rates in relation to adipocytes treated with scrambled siRNA when stimulated with submaximal (1 nm) or maximal concentrations (100 nm) of insulin. The effect of combined depletion of c-Cbl and Cbl-b on the regulation of GLUT4 translocation was also analyzed (Fig. 2, B and C). Cotransfection of Myc-GLUT4-EGFP plasmid with the mixture of c-Cbl- and Cbl-b-directed siRNAs caused ∼95% depletion of Cbl protein expression (see Fig. 2A) with no effect on insulin-stimulated Myc-GLUT4-GFP translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Quantifying the ratio of cell surface Myc rim signal over the total Myc-GLUT4-GFP signal in transfected cells revealed comparable Myc-GLUT4-GFP on the cell surface of both control and Cbl-depleted adipocytes (Fig. 2C). The data indicate that neither deoxyglucose transport nor GLUT4 recycling in response to insulin is perturbed following the loss of both Cbl isoforms in cultured adipocytes. siRNA-mediated CrkII Depletion Has No Impact on Insulin-stimulated Deoxyglucose Transport in 3T3L1 Adipocytes—SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein CrkII is another important component in the CAP-Cbl-Tc10 pathway (48Ribon V. Alan R. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cbl reportedly recruits CrkII to lipid rafts along with guanine nucleotide factor C3G, which in its turn activates the Rho family protein TC10 (49Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 depicts the consequence of selective attenuation of CrkII expression on insulin regulation of glucose transport. Electroporation of siRNA species Crk733, but not Crk852, into 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused a 79% inhibition of CrkII protein expression as measured by densitometric analysis. However, contrary to the proposed role of CrkII in glucose transport stimulation, markedly decreased CrkII protein expression had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Fig. 3C). Primary Adipocytes from c-Cbl knock-out Mice Respond Normally to Insulin—During preparation of this manuscript, a report appeared that suggested some inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in cultured human adipocytes upon siRNA-based depletion of Cbl (32Ahn M.Y. Katsanakis K.D. Bheda F. Pillay T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21526-21532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whether or not the levels of GLUT4 protein were reduced due to potential toxicity of the eight different siRNAs used in tandem in this human cell line was not shown in this study. To substantiate our data from 3T3-L1 cells, we analyzed insulin action on glucose uptake in primary adipocytes derived from c-Cbl knock-out mice (Fig. 4). As revealed in Fig. 4A, primary mouse adipocytes express c-Cbl but very little Cbl-b compared with 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and ablation of c-Cbl in the primary adipocytes of c-Cbl knock-out mice did not significantly enhance Cbl-b expression. Consistent with our data in cultured adipocytes, both control and c-Cbl-deficient primary adipocytes show similar glucose uptake increases when stimulated with 1, 10, or 100 nm insulin (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the data obtained in this study provide compelling evidence that Cbl proteins are not required for optimal insulin signaling and regulation of GLUT4 in either cultured 3T3-L1 or primary mouse adipocytes. Furthermore, CAP and CrkII are not apparently required for insulin regulation of hexose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1979282827,"NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated increases in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents are associated with long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Here, we provide evidence that similar changes occur in response to normal increases in sensory stimulation during development. Experiments discriminated between eye opening-induced and age-dependent changes in synaptic currents. At 6 hr after eye opening (AEO), a transient population of currents mediated by NR2B-rich NMDARs increase significantly, and silent synapses peak. Sustained increases in evoked and miniature AMPAR currents occur at 12 hr AEO. Significant changes in AMPAR:NMDAR evoked current ratios, contacts per axon, and inputs per cell are present at 24 hr AEO. The AMPAR current changes are those seen in vitro during NMDAR-dependent LTP. Here, they are a consequence of eye opening and are associated with a new wave of synaptic refinement. These data also suggest that new NR2B-rich NMDAR currents precede and may initiate this developmental synaptic potentiation and functional tuning."
https://openalex.org/W1999016712,"AKAP12/Gravin, one of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), functions as a kinase scaffold protein and as a dynamic regulator of the β2-adrenergic receptor complex. However, the biological role of AKAP12 in cancer development is not well understood. The AKAP12 gene encodes two major isoforms of 305 and 287 kDa (designated AKAP12A and AKAP12B, respectively, in this report). We found that these two isoforms are independently expressed and that they are probably under the control of two different promoters. Moreover, both isoforms were absent from the majority of human gastric cancer cells. The results from methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing revealed that the 5′ CpG islands of both AKAP12A and AKAP12B are frequently hypermethylated in gastric cancer cells. Treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor and/or histone deacetylase inhibitor efficiently restored the expression of AKAP12 isoforms, confirming that DNA methylation is directly involved in the transcriptional silencing of AKAP12 in gastric cancer cells. Hypermethylation of AKAP12A CpG island was also detected in 56% (10 of 18) of primary gastric tumors. The restoration of AKAP12A in AKAP12-nonexpressing cells reduced colony formation and induced apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our results suggest that AKAP12A may function as an important negative regulator of the survival pathway in human gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2031728418,"A chronic state of immune hyperactivation is a feature of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. Studies on the molecular mechanisms by which HIV-1 can modulate the activation state of T cells indicate that both Nef and Tat can alter T cell activation. However, the vast majority of data has been obtained from experiments performed with vectors encoding a single virus protein. We demonstrate that infection of human CD4(+) T lymphocytes with fully infectious HIV-1 leads to a hyper-responsiveness of the interleukin-2 promoter. Hypersensitivity in HIV-1-infected T cells was observed upon stimulation with various agents that are engaging different signal transduction pathways. Experiments performed with recombinant heat stable antigen-encoding HIV-1 indicated that the virus-infected cells are the cells with an enhanced response. Both Nef and Tat are involved in this virus-mediated enhancing effect on interleukin-2 promoter activity. Interestingly, whereas Nef seems to be acting mainly through hyperactivation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), Tat acts in an NFAT-independent manner. Mobility shift experiments demonstrated that the HIV-1-associated priming of human T cells for stimulation results in a greater induction of transcription factors recognized as essential players in T cell activation, i.e. NFAT, NF-kappaB, and AP-1. A hyper-responsive state was also established upon HIV-1 infection of a more natural cellular reservoir, i.e. primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Considering that the HIV-1 life cycle is tightly regulated by the T cell signaling machinery, the priming for activation of a major viral reservoir represents a means by which this retrovirus can create an ideal cellular microenvironment for its propagation and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2042380591,"BK virus (BKV) is ubiquitous in the human population and establishes a lifelong, subclinical persistent infection in the urinary tract. When the immune system is compromised, it can cause severe disease in the kidney and bladder. Detection of BKV sequences in urinary tract neoplasms has led to the postulate that this virus may induce human oncogenesis through the function of its large tumor antigen (TAg). In this study, examination of prostate tumor tissue sections using in situ hybridization shows the presence of BKV sequences in atrophic epithelium. Solution polymerase chain reaction on DNA extracted from the tissues and sequence analysis of the products reveal the presence of BKV regulatory and early region sequences. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific to TAg or p53 shows the expression of TAg in some of the samples and p53 staining that can be correlated to TAg expression. Although the normal cellular localization of TAg and p53 is nuclear, double immunofluorescence labeling with anti-p53 and TAg antibodies indicates colocalization of p53 and TAg to the cytoplasm in the glandular epithelial cells of the sections. Although BKV DNA was found in benign and atrophic lesions, TAg and p53 coexpression was observed only in atrophic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2130281912,"The ability of rice seedlings to grow from dry seed under anoxia provides a rare opportunity in a multicellular eukaryote to study the stages of mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by oxygen availability. The function and proteome of rice mitochondria synthesized under 6 days of anoxia following 1 day of air adaptation have been compared with mitochondria isolated from 7-day aerobically grown rice seedlings. Rice coleoptiles grown under anoxia, and the mitochondria isolated from them respired very slowly compared with air-adapted and air-grown seedlings. Immunodetection of key mitochondrial protein markers, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis followed by SDS-PAGE to make soluble mitochondria proteome maps, and shotgun sequencing of mitochondrial proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry all revealed similar patterns of the major function categories of mitochondrial proteins from both anoxic and air-adapted samples. Activity analysis showed respiratory oxidases markedly increased in activity during the air adaptation of seedlings. Blue-native electrophoresis followed by SDS-PAGE of mitochondrial membrane proteins clearly showed the very low abundance of assembled b/c complex and cytochrome c1 oxidase complex in the mitochondrial membrane in anoxic samples and the dramatic increase in the abundance of these complexes on air adaptation. Total heme content, cytochrome absorbance spectra, and the electron carrier, cytochrome c, also increased markedly on air adaptation. These results likely reflect limited heme synthesis for cytochrome assembly in the absence of oxygen and represent a discrete and reversible blockage of full mitochondrial biogenesis in this anoxia-tolerant species.

These results likely reflect limited heme synthesis for cytochrome assembly in the absence of oxygen and represent a discrete and reversible blockage of full mitochondrial biogenesis in this anoxia-tolerant species. The structure and functional status of mitochondria in the absence of O2 has intrigued researchers for decades. Early studies in yeast initially suggested that mitochondria degraded and were lost during anaerobic growth (1Wallace P.G. Linnane A.W. Nature. 1964; 201: 1191-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but later reduced mitochondrial structures with altered morphology and those lacking respiratory activity were clearly identified in anaerobic yeast and termed “protomitochondria” (2Criddle R.S. Schatz G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Extending these studies to animals has been hampered by the susceptibility of many cells to long term lowered oxygen concentrations, which simply lead to energy deprivation and cell death (3Hochachka P.W. Science. 1986; 231: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 4Zhu H. Bunn F. Science. 2001; 292: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Many experiments have been conducted on tissues that develop in the presence of O2 and are assessed during short term oxygen deprivation. Such studies have shown that mammalian mitochondria may function as oxygen sensors and secondary messengers by increasing their generation of reactive oxygen species during the early stages of oxygen deprivation (5Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Induction of some “hypoxic nuclear genes” in both mammals and yeast requires mitochondrial respiration and cytochrome c oxidase has been shown to function as a key oxygen sensor during this process (6Dagsgaard C. Taylor L.E. O'Brien K.M. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Within the plant kingdom a very broad plasticity in primary metabolic function has developed to cope with altered oxygen availability (7Sachs M.M. Freeling M. Okimoto R. Cell. 1980; 20: 761-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 8Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Ann. Bot. 2003; 91: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Some plant species exhibit extreme tolerance to prolonged anoxic conditions by maintaining an energy charge through increased glycolysis and redistributed energy allocation (9Gibbs J. Morrell S. Valdez A. Setter T.L. Greenway H. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rice is one of the most anoxia-tolerant plant crop species (10Setter T.L. Ellis M. Laureles E.V. Ella E.S. Senadhira D. Mishra S.B. Sarkarung S. Datta S. Ann. Bot. 1997; 79: 67-77Crossref Google Scholar), is able to germinate and sustain early seedling growth in strictly anoxic solutions (11Ueda K. Tsuji H. Protoplasma. 1971; 73: 203-215Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Vartapetian B.B. Maslov A.I. Andreeva I.N. Plant Sci. Lett. 1975; 4: 1-8Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) or even under a high vacuum (13Costes C. Vartapetian B.B. Plant Sci. Lett. 1978; 11: 115-119Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and can readily return to atmospheric or aerobic conditions without substantial damage (14Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ushimaru T. Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 1065-1071Google Scholar). Under field conditions rice is often sown into anoxic mud in unstirred flooded land and germinates to meet aerobic conditions as it grows upward (16Setter T.L. Ella E.S. Ann. Bot. 1994; 74: 265-271Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the return of anoxically grown rice seedlings to air there are a number of well documented responses to sudden oxygen availability including increased respiratory rate (14Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), elevation of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, dehydroascorbate/monohydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase (15Ushimaru T. Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 1065-1071Google Scholar, 17Ushimaru T. Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 211-218Google Scholar, 18Boo Y.C. Jung J. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 155: 255-261Crossref Google Scholar), and heightened levels of small molecule antioxidants such as glutathione, ascorbate, and α-tocopherol (15Ushimaru T. Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 1065-1071Google Scholar, 17Ushimaru T. Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1994; 35: 211-218Google Scholar). Mitochondrial structures appear to proliferate in rice seedlings even when they are grown under anoxic conditions from dry seed. Ultrastructural studies of mitochondria from anoxic rice tissues show a matrix of lower density and a more defined membrane cristae structure than is apparent in mitochondria from aerobic seedlings (19Couee I. Defontaine S. Carde J. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Vartapetian B.B. Andreeva I.N. Kozlova G.I. Protoplasma. 1976; 88: 215-224Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Couee et al. (19Couee I. Defontaine S. Carde J. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have also shown that rice mitochondria from anoxic tissues can carry out in organello protein synthesis when the functional respiratory chain is inhibited. This suggests rice mitochondria grown in anoxic conditions can bypass the electron transport function requirement for organellar protein synthesis that is apparent in most plant mitochondria. Fox and Kennedy (21Fox T.C. Kennedy R.A. Planta. 1991; 184: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) found that the activities of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes succinyl-CoA synthase and citrate synthase were similar in aerobically and anaerobically grown seedlings, whereas the activities of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and fumarase were reduced in anaerobic seedlings. The rate of succinate oxidation and succinate dehydrogenase activity has also been reported to be lower in mitochondria from rice seedlings grown submerged but increased during adaptation to air. Cytochromes have been shown to be present in anoxically grown rice but at lower levels than in aerobic controls (12Vartapetian B.B. Maslov A.I. Andreeva I.N. Plant Sci. Lett. 1975; 4: 1-8Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial cytochrome content increases rapidly on air adaptation from anoxia (22Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 629-635Google Scholar). Respiratory oxidase gene expression has been reported to respond to oxygen deprivation and air adaptation in rice (23Tsuji H. Nakazono M. Saisho D. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transcript abundance from nuclear-encoded genes for components of both the cytochrome and alternative oxidases in mitochondria were reduced during anoxia and induced by air adaptation. The same authors have shown recently a specific isoform of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2a) is induced on re-aeration of hypoxic rice seedlings, putatively to defend against damage from acetaldehyde accumulation post-submergence (24Tsuji H. Meguro N. Suzuki Y. Tsutsumi N. Hirai A. Nakazono M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The degree to which these reported changes in specific mitochondrial activities and transcript levels explain mitochondrial dysfunction from anoxically grown rice seedlings, and to what extent dysfunction is because of transcriptional, translational, or post-translational factors remains unclear. Further, the much reduced state of mitochondria in anoxia in yeast suggest an oxygen-derived trigger for full mitochondrial biogenesis, but the nature of mitochondrial proteomes under anoxia have not been systematically investigated to date in either anoxia-tolerant or -intolerant plants. We have recently studied the rice mitochondrial proteome in air-grown seedlings (25Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By following the induction of respiration in rice coleoptiles during air adaptation of anoxic seedlings and assessing the changes in the rice mitochondrial proteome during this transition, we showed that much of the mitochondrial proteome appears relatively unaffected by anaerobic growth. However, we showed that the specific low abundance of cytochrome-containing complexes of the respiratory chain likely explains the markedly reduced respiratory function of both intact anoxically grown rice seedlings and the mitochondria they contain. Plant Material—Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Amaroo) seeds were germinated in 5-liter conical flasks containing 2.5 liters of rice growth medium (0.5 mm MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-MS/MS; BN, blue-native; FW, fresh weight; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl-]glycine; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; IEF, isoelectric focusing. 0.5 mm CaCl2, 6 mg/liter carbenicillin, pH 6.5). The seeds were sterilized using 70% ethanol and 5% (v/v) bleach and washed before being placed in conical flasks. The flasks were incubated at 30 °C in the dark. Depending on the treatment required, flasks were continuously bubbled with either commercial grade N2 or air at 1 liter min–1 using spargers placed below the water level. The presence of O2 was monitored using Anaerobic Indicator™ (Don Whitley Scientific Ltd.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Mitochondrial Isolation—The coleoptiles from ∼16,000 seedlings were separated from their seeds in a large container of water using a manual rubbing technique. Coleoptiles float, and seeds sink following separation. The floating coleoptiles were skimmed from the surface using netting, weighed, and placed on ice. This operation could be conducted in less than 30 min. Coleoptiles (∼60 g FW) were ground at 4 °C by mortar and pestle using a ratio of 1 part tissue (g FW) to 3 parts grinding medium (ml) (0.3 m mannitol, 25 mm tetrasodiumpyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, 1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm ascorbic acid, pH 7.5). The homogenate was filtered centrifuged at 5 min at 966 × g, the pellet discarded and the supernatant centrifuged for 20 min at 17,400 × g. The pellets were then dispersed in the residual supernatant diluted with wash buffer (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5), and the two-centrifugation steps were repeated. The crude organelle pellets were then layered over a self-forming 26% (w/v) Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) gradient made in wash buffer and centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 45 min. The mitochondria formed a band toward the bottom of the tube. Aspirated mitochondria samples were concentrated, and Percoll was removed by centrifugation twice in wash buffer for 15 min at 27,200 × g. Oxygen Consumption—Whole tissue O2 consumption rates were recorded using 5–10 coleoptiles, seeds, or whole seedlings in 3 ml of fresh rice growth medium in a Clarke-type oxygen electrode (Rank Brothers, Cambridge). KCN (1 mm) and salicylhydroxamic acid (1 mm) were used to inhibit respiratory oxidases, showing that oxygen consumption recorded from whole tissues was >90% respiratory in origin. O2 consumption from isolated mitochondria was measured in a Clark-type O2 electrode in 1 ml of reaction medium (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). No respiratory rates from mitochondrial samples were detected prior to substrate additions. The following reagents and inhibitors were added to the mitochondria to examine mitochondrial integrity and function, ascorbate (10 mm), cytochrome c (25 μm), Triton X-100 (0.05% w/v), KCN (1 mm), ATP (100 μm), NADH (1 mm), ADP (0.05 mm), myxothiozol (5 μm), pyruvate (5 mm), dithiothreitol (2 mm), n-propylgallate (5 μm), salicylhydroxamic acid (1 mm), KCN (1 mm), malate (10 mm), NAD+ (1 mm), and thiamine pyrophosphate (1 mm). Succinate-dependent respiration was measured in the presence of ATP to activate succinate dehydrogenase and in the presence of ADP to maximize respiratory rate. Succinate- and NADH-dependent respiration was measured in the same manner with these dual substrates. Malate- and pyruvate-dependent respiration was measured with the addition of NAD and thiamine pyrophosphate as cofactors and ADP to maximize respiratory rate. The alternative oxidase respiratory rate was measured in the presence of succinate and NADH to maximize electron flux, myxothiazol and KCN to block cytochrome pathway operation, and pyruvate and dithiothreitol to fully activate alternative oxidase. The alternative oxidase rate was fully inhibited by addition of the inhibitor, n-propylgallate. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured by the solubilization of mitochondrial membranes with Triton X-100 and the provision of electrons by a reduced cytochrome c regenerating system consisting of exogenous cytochrome c and ascorbate. The cytochrome c-dependent oxygen consumption rate was inhibited by KCN. Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances, Heme, and Cytochrome Assays—The measurement of malondialdehyde equivalents was based on the method of Hodges et al. (26Hodges D.M. DeLong J.M. Forney C.F. Prange R.K. Planta. 1999; 207: 604-611Crossref Scopus (2888) Google Scholar). The total heme content of mitochondrial samples was measured as pyridine hemochrome after a reaction of heme with an alkaline pyridine solution (0.2 m NaOH, 4.2 m pyridine) according to Appleby and Bergersen (27Appleby C.A. Bergersen F.J. Bergersen F.J. Methods for Evaluating Biological Nitrogen Fixation. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester1980: 315-335Google Scholar). Hemochrome content was assessed from reduced-minus-oxidized spectra (A500–650) using trace addition of sodium dithionite or potassium ferricyanide to reduce or oxidize, respectively. A556–A539 from these spectra and the extinction coefficient e = 23.4 mm–1 was used to determine the molar hemochrome content according to established formulas (27Appleby C.A. Bergersen F.J. Bergersen F.J. Methods for Evaluating Biological Nitrogen Fixation. John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester1980: 315-335Google Scholar). Cytochrome reduced-minus-oxidized spectra (A400–700) were recorded in mitochondrial samples suspended in wash buffer (2 mg of mitochondrial protein ml–1). Succinate (10 mm), NADH (0.1 mm), and sodium dithionite were added to reduce cytochromes, and no treatment was used as the control oxidized cytochrome sample. Peak identifications were undertaken by comparison to work of Chance and Williams (28Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 395-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Shibasaka and Tsuji (22Shibasaka M. Tsuji H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 629-635Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Immunodetection—Mitochondrial proteins (50 μg) were separated using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked and analyzed with a series of antibodies raised to tricarboxylic acid cycle components according to standard protocols. Lipoic acid attached to acyltransferases in 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes and H protein of glycine decarboxylase were identified with the polyclonal antibody raised to lipoic acid (29Humphries K.M. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15835-15841Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The E1α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alternative oxidase, β-subunit of ATP-synthase, HSP70, and outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel were monoclonal antibodies raised against maize mitochondrial proteins from Dr. Tom Elthon, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE. Cytochrome c was a monoclonal raised to the pigeon enzyme (Pharmingen). A chemiluminescence detection kit was used to visualize the immunoreaction that was then recorded using an Image Analyzer (LAS 100, Fuji, Tokyo); when noted, chemiluminescence was quantified with Image Gauge v3.0 software (Fuji, Tokyo). Two-dimensional Gel Separation and Staining—Isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out according to Millar et al. (35Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Giege P. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1711-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) using non-linear 3–10 pH IEF strips. Blue-native PAGE analysis was carried out according to published methods (30Jansch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and second dimension SDS-PAGE was done by Tris-Tricine separations. Protein spots from polyacrylamide gels were excised and prepared for analysis by MS according to Sweetlove et al. (31Sweetlove L.J. Heazlewood J.L. Herald V. Holtzapffel R. Day D.A. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie (G250) staining, gels were placed in a solution of 17% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, 34% (v/v) methanol, 3% (v/v) phosphoric acid, 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 for 16 h and destained in 0.5% (v/v) phosphoric acid for 24 h. Gels were scanned using a 12-bit transparency scanner (Image Scanner, Amersham Biosciences). Changes in spot intensity were analyzed by ImageMaster two-dimensional Elite software (Amersham Biosciences) on 12-bit TIFF images using background subtraction by the lowest-on-boundary method.

For LC-MS/MS, the mitochondrial samples of 100-μg were acetone-precipitated at –20 °C overnight. The resulting precipitated protein pellet was resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The protein lysate was digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin 1/10 (w/w), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Digested samples of 15–20-μg were analyzed on a QStar Pulsar MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems) utilizing an inline Agilent 1100 capillary LC system incorporating a Zorbax C18 reverse phase column (Agilent) for peptide separations. Peptides were analyzed by MS over an 8-h elution period with increasing acetonitrile concentrations from 2 to 80% (v/v) in H2O and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Ions were automatically selected for the N2 collision cell by the Analyst QS software package (Applied Biosystems). Data from both gel-extracted peptides and whole mitochondrial lysates were analyzed by an in-house data base comprising TIGR and NCBI rice protein sets, which were searched with the resulting MS/MS data at error tolerances of MS ± 0.15 and MS/MS ±0.05 using ProID, or analyzed online using the Mascot data base 2Available at matrixscience.com. with MS/MS data at error tolerances of MS ± 1.2 and MS/MS ± 0.6. Rice Seedling Growth and Respiratory Capacity under Anoxia and in Air—Over the course of 7 days, cv. Amaroo rice seeds germinated, and coleoptiles elongated under strict anoxia. These seedlings did not exhibit any root elongation or leaf development, consistent with the long known requirement of trace levels of O2 for these developmental processes to initiate (32Tsuji H. Bot. Mag. Tokyo. 1972; 85: 207-218Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, chemical colorimetric indicators of anaerobiosis showed that O2 levels were negligible during the period of growth and did not fluctuate during the experiment (data not shown). After 7 days, coleoptiles had emerged and elongated to ∼20 mm in length. The Amaroo cultivar has been shown to be highly tolerant to anoxia in comparison to other commercial rice cultivars (33Huang S. Greenway H. Colmer T.D. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The transfer of coleoptiles on day 6 to sparging with air for 24 h resulted in only a small increase in coleoptile length but no significant change in mass by day 7, compared with the 7-day anoxic controls (Fig. 1, A and B). Root initiation was observed during the 24 h of air adaptation, and aeration of the solution was also indicated by colorimetric indicators of anaerobiosis (data not shown). In comparison, the germination of rice seedlings in air-saturated solutions for 7 days yielded seedlings with 70-mm long coleoptiles with nearly double the fresh weight mass of anoxic controls (Fig. 1, A and B), and this growth was accompanied with extensive root and primary leaf development. The assessment of O2 exposure and the degree of O2 toxicity following adaptation was also determined by measuring lipid peroxidation levels as malondialdehyde equivalents in the rice coleoptile tissue. This analysis revealed that the exposure of rice to air for 24 h more than doubled the extractable malondialdehyde content, whereas germination in air for the whole 7-day period yielded malondialdehyde levels more than 6 times those found in anoxic controls (Fig. 1C). A portion of the seedlings from each of the three treatment groups was rapidly removed, and O2 consumption capacities in air-saturated conditions were assessed (Fig. 2A). Although all seedlings were capable of O2 consumption, seedlings from the 24-h air-adapted and the 7-day air-grown treatments exhibited nearly twice the respiratory rate of anoxic control seedlings on a FW basis. When the O2 consumption capacity of the seed and coleoptiles was assessed separately it was evident that nearly all of the increased O2 consumption capacity of the 24-h air-treated seedlings compared with anoxic controls was because of coleoptile respiration. On the other hand, in 7-day air-grown seedlings both the seed and the coleoptile contributed to the high respiratory rate. The addition of 50 mm glucose and/or the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (10 μm) to coleoptiles did not increase respiratory rates, whereas more than 90% of coleoptile rates were inhibited by addition of 1 mm KCN and 1 mm salicylhydroxamic acid (data not shown). Respiration by Mitochondria from Anoxically and Air-grown Rice Coleoptiles—Mitochondria were isolated from coleoptiles grown under the three treatments regimes. The pattern of maximum O2 consumption rates between treatments was similar using succinate/ADP or a combination of succinate/NADH/ADP as substrates (Fig. 2B). Mitochondria from anoxic treatments exhibited a 3–4-fold lower O2 consumption rate than mitochondria from the 24-h air-adapted seedlings. The mitochondria from the air-adapted and air-grown seedlings were not significantly different. Malate- and pyruvate-dependent O2 consumption was lower than what was measured during succinate and NADH oxidation in all samples; it was nearly 8-fold lower in anoxically grown samples than in air-adapted samples on a mitochondrial protein basis. All respiration rates were largely inhibited by the cytochrome pathway inhibitors KCN and myxothiazol, except in the case of the 24-h air-adapted samples that consistently revealed a KCN-insensitive respiratory rate that could be inhibited by the alternative oxidase inhibitor n-propylgallate. A measurement of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity revealed a very large difference between anoxically grown and air-adapted samples. The 24 h of air adaptation appeared to be sufficient to elevate COX activity close to the levels measured in mitochondria from air-grown seedlings (Fig. 2B). Together these data suggested that respiratory capacity in mitochondria from anoxically grown coleoptiles was greatly limited by COX activity, with the respiratory rates driven by succinate and NADH oxidation approaching the apparent COX capacity. Western Blot Analysis of Mitochondrial Protein Abundances— Western blot analysis of selected mitochondrial proteins revealed that although there were some changes in abundance of specific components between treatments, overall a maintenance of key mitochondrial proteins in all three treatments was observed (Fig. 3). The outer membrane marker VDAC, the inner membrane marker β-subunit ATP synthase, the matrix markers of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits and HSP70, were all unchanged by the treatments on a mitochondrial protein basis. The alternative oxidase was not detectable in anoxically grown or air-grown coleoptiles but was clearly induced by a 24-h air adaptation of anoxic coleoptiles. This was consistent with the KCN-insensitive O2 consumption recorded in these samples (Fig. 2B). The H protein of glycine decarboxylase was not present in anoxic treatments but was found to increase with the degree of air exposure, consistent with the onset of leaf development. Two-dimensional Gel Analysis of Mitochondrial Proteomes from Anoxic and 24-h Air-treated Coleoptiles—To further compare the protein complement between the anoxic samples and the near fully functioning 24-h air-adapted mitochondrial samples, soluble proteins from these samples were separated by classical IEF/SDS-PAGE. These separations of 1 mg of mitochondrial protein revealed very similar protein spot patterns between the two treatments. Typical examples of a paired experiment are shown in Fig. 4."

Here, we demonstrate that processing of context by the PFC plays an important role in the control of language comprehension and production. Using a missing letter paradigm and fMRI, we found that increased activation in the PFC (but not in posterior regions), while encoding and maintaining context information, predicted context-appropriate responses. Furthermore, greater selection demands increased activity during responding in the same regions engaged during the encoding and maintenance of context. Overall, as in other cognitive task domains, these results suggest that PFC context processing plays an important role in the control of language."
https://openalex.org/W2162106997,"Adipose differentiation is regulated by several transcription factors, such as the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein family and peroxisome proliferator activator (PPAR) γ2. Several recent studies have shown that the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS superfamily is also involved in the regulation of adipose differentiation. In this study, we investigated the roles played by EPAS1 (endothelial PAS domain protein 1) in adipogenesis. EPAS1, also referred to as hypoxia-inducible factor 2α, is a transcription factor known to play essential roles in catecholamine homeostasis, vascular remodeling, and the maintenance of reactive oxygen species, and so forth. During adipose differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells, the level of EPAS1 mRNA began to increase 6 days after the induction, and EPAS1 was highly expressed in differentiated cells. To examine whether EPAS1 is involved in adipogenesis, we first isolated stable clones from 3T3-L1 cells in which we could induce the expression of an EPAS1 C-terminal deletion mutant (designated EPAS1-(1–485)) with the insect hormone. The induction of EPAS1-(1–485) allowed the cells to accumulate only minimum amounts of intracellular lipid droplets. Consistent with the morphological observations, a minimum amount of aP2 and PPARγ2 mRNA was induced in the EPAS1-(1–485) cells. We then examined whether or not EPAS1 was able to promote adipogenesis in NIH 3T3 cells, a relatively nonadipogenic cell line. Overexpression of EPAS1 in NIH 3T3 cells induced a significant amount of lipid accumulation compared with that of the control cells in the presence of the PPARγ ligand. The results were also confirmed by measuring the expression of adipocyte-related genes. Adenovirus-mediated EPAS1-(1–485) expression resulted in the reduction of basal and insulin-dependent glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The mechanism involved the transcriptional regulation of GLUT1, GLUT4, and IRS3 expression by EPAS1. Taken together, these results suggest that EPAS1 plays several supporting roles in maintaining specific aspects of adipogenesis and adipocyte function including regulation of glucose uptake followed by lipid synthesis.

Adipose differentiation is a complex process by which fibroblast-like undifferentiated cells are converted into cells that accumulate lipid droplets. Recent studies using DNA arrays revealed that expression of several hundred genes is altered in this process (1Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This complex differentiation process is driven by the coordinated expression of various transcription factors, including the CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) 1The abbreviations used are: C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator activator; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; PonA, ponasterone A. family and peroxisome proliferator activator (PPAR) γ2 (2Cornelius P.

In pre-adipocytes, the Wnt signaling pathway is part of the machinery, which maintains the cells in undifferentiated states (5Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Adipogenesis begins on the treatment of preadipocytes with fetal calf serum, insulin, dexamethasone, and an inducer of intracellular cyclic AMP such as isobuthylmethylxanthine. A rapid and transient increase in transcription and expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is observed in the early stages of differentiation. These factors have been shown to promote adipogenesis, presumably through induction of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 (2Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ectopic expression of C/EBPα failed to rescue the ability to differentiate in PPARγ-null mouse embryo fibroblasts (13Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Therefore, rather than being an equal co-director of the adipogenesis program, PPARγ2 plays a leading role in the adipogenic hierarchy. On the other hand, C/EBPα is critical in the establishment of insulin sensitivity (12Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). This effect of C/EBPα is mediated in part by the direct transcriptional induction of both the insulin receptor and IRS1 (12Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Consequently, C/EBPα is influential in maintaining the expression of PPARγ2 and in promoting full insulin sensitivity. Several recent studies have shown that the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS superfamily is also involved in regulation of adipose differentiation (14Shimba S. Wada T. Tezuka M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2809-2817PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 16Holder J.L. Butte N.F. Zim A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 101-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The bHLH-PAS proteins are characterized by the PAS domain, which is composed of two imperfect 50-amino acid repeats and a bHLH domain. The term “PAS” is derived from the first three members of the family: the period gene, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator gene (ARNT), and the single-minded (SIM) gene. Using the PAS domain and the bHLH domain, proteins of this family form heterodimers that bind to a target gene through the basic region and govern the functions of that gene. The PAS domain is found in a variety of proteins that play roles in development and adaptation to the environment, such as neurogenesis (18Nambu J.R. Lewis J.O. Wharton K.A. Crews S.T. Cell. 1991; 67: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), circadian rhythms (19Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 389: 443-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), hypoxia (20Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), and xenobiotic metabolism (21Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). Thus, members of bHLH-PAS superfamily are thought to serve as sensors of environmental and developmental signals. We recently demonstrated that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand-dependent transcription factor, is involved in the negative regulation of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (14Shimba S. Wada T. Tezuka M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2809-2817PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism of action in this case is that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor inhibits the PPARγ2 activation pathway by stimulating p107 expression and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the inhibition of the PPARγ2 signaling pathway results in a lower level of morphological differentiation in aryl hydrocarbon receptor-activated cells (14Shimba S. Wada T. Tezuka M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2809-2817PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia inhibits adipogenesis in a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α-dependent manner (15Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The putative mechanism for this process is that HIF-1α-regulated gene Dec 1/Stra 13 represses PPARγ2 promoter activity (15Yun Z. Maecker H.L. Johnson R.S. Giaccia A.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have shown that disruption of the Sim1 gene by a de novo balanced translocation between chromosomes results in obesity (16Holder J.L. Butte N.F. Zim A.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 101-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Sim1 heterozygous mice develop early-onset obesity (17Michaud J.L. Boucher F. Melnyk A. Gauthier F. Goshu E. Levy E. Mitchell G.A. Himms-Hagen J. Fan C.-M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Consequently, several bHLH-PAS proteins are thought to participate in the regulation of adipose differentiation. Among the proteins of bHLH-PAS family, we have focused here on the roles played by EPAS1 (endothelial PAS domain protein 1) in adipogenesis. EPAS1, also referred to as HIF-2α, HLF, or MOP2, is a transcription factor predominantly expressed in endothelial cells and the organ of ZuckerlandI (22Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 23Flamme I. Frohlich T. von Reutern M. Kappel A. Damert A. Risau W. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 25Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Studies using EPAS1-null mice revealed that EPAS1 is essential for catecholamine homeostasis and vascular remodeling (25Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 26Compernolle V. Brusselmans K. Acker T. Hoet P. Tjwa M. Beck H. Plaisance S. Dor Y. Keshet E. Lupu F. Nemery B. Dewerchin M. Veldhoven P.V. Plate K. Moons L. Collen D. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 702-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Scortegagna et al. (27Scortegagna M. Ding K. Oktay Y. Gaur A. Thurmond F. Yan L.-J. Marck B.T. Matsumoto A.M. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Bennett M.J. Garcia J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) revealed that EPAS1 plays a role in the maintenance of reactive oxygen species. In addition to these roles, a contribution of EPAS1 to the regulation of adipogenesis has been suggested for the following reasons. First, several growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor, induce and activate EPAS1 activity in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent or related manner (28Akeno N. Robins J. Zhang M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Clemens T.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Also, HIF-1α, which is closely related to EPAS1, mediates insulin signaling in hepatocytes (29Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.-Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). More importantly, EPAS1 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue (this study). We show here that overexpression of a dominant negative form of EPAS1 in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells resulted in the suppression of morphological differentiation, as well as in the induction of adipocyte-related genes. The mechanism involves the direct transcriptional regulation of GLUT1, GLUT4, and IRS3 genes by EPAS1. We also examined here the ability of EPAS1 to induce adipose differentiation in nonadipogenic cells. Ectopic expression of wild-type EPAS1 in NIH 3T3 cells induced morphological differentiation and the expression of adipocyte-related genes. These results suggest that EPAS1 is an important transcription factor in the regulation of adipose differentiation. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells, obtained from the Human Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. For induction of adipose differentiation, the cells were grown to confluence. The cells were then fed with differentiation medium (a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.6 μm insulin, 0.0005% transferrin, 180 μm adenine, 20 pm triiodothyronine, 0.25 μm dexamethasone, and 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine). After 3 days, the cells were refed with fresh differentiation medium without dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine and maintained over the following days. Oil Red O Staining—To judge the state of adipose differentiation by visual inspection, cultures were fixed with 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h, rinsed three times with distilled water, and then air-dried. The fixed cells were stained with 0.5% Oil Red O solution for 1 h. After staining, the cultures were rinsed several times with 70% ethanol. Immunoblot Analysis of EPAS1 Protein—The cells, grown in 60-mm dishes, were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The rinsed cells were scraped off the dish, placed in a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 1 min. The resulting pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.8), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.0002% leupeptin, and 20% glycerol), vortex-mixed, and rocked at 4 °C for 60 min. The suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatants were then frozen until further analysis. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined according to the method of Bradford, using bovine serum albumin as the standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Protein samples were denatured by heating them to 90 °C in SDS-reducing buffer and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes, the filters were probed with antibodies against EPAS1 (Novous) or the FLAG motif (Stratagene). Color visualization was performed with secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-in-dolyl-phosphate substrate solution (Promega). Ponasterone A (PonA)-inducible EPAS1-(1–485) Expression System— The PonA-inducible EPAS1-(1–485) expression system was constructed using complete control mammalian expression system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, EPAS1-(1–485) cDNA was generated by PCR using full-length EPAS1 cDNA (31Hara S. Hamada J. Kobayashi C. Kondo Y. Imura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and subcloned into expression vector pEGSH, which is under the control of the PonA-responsive regulatory plasmid pVgRXR. Cells stably transfected with regulatory plasmid pVgRXR were selected in conventional medium containing G418 (450 μg/ml). After selection and isolation, the cells were also transfected with pEGSH-EPAS1-(1–485) and allowed to grow in nonselective medium for 48 h. The cells were then cultured in medium containing hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). After 2–3 weeks, clones were isolated and expanded individually. Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted from the clones with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by Northern blotting. Probes were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR techniques. Adenovirus Infection—Adenovirus expressing EPAS1-(1–485) tagged with the FLAG motif was prepared according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Clontech). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of infection of ∼50 in OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 24 h. Promoter Analysis—The promoter region of GLUT1 gene (-3586 to +237), GLUT4 gene (-785 to -1), IRS3 gene (-1787 to +1), PPARγ2 gene (-615 to +67), and EPAS1 gene (-1169 to +3) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from 3T3-L1 cells. The DNA fragments amplified were subcloned into pGL3 basic vector. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids by lipofection, and the transfected cells were grown in conventional medium for 48 h. The cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were assayed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Determination of 2-Deoxyglucose Transport Activity—3T3-L1 adipocytes were deprived of insulin by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with 1 μm insulin in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer (1.36 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. The glucose uptake reaction was initiated by the addition of Krebs-Ringer-Hepes buffer containing 2-[14C]deoxyglucose (1 mCi/mmol) to each well, and after 5 min, the reaction was terminated by washing the wells three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then solubilized in 1 m NaOH, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (ALOKA). Akt Phosphorylation—3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with 1 μm insulin in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg of leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The amount of phosphorylated Akt in cell lysates was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology). The Level of EPAS1 Increased during Adipose Differentiation in 3T3-L1 Cells—In the first set of experiments, we examined the expression level of EPAS1 in mice adipose tissue. In white adipose tissue isolated from C57BL/6J mice, EPAS1 was predominantly expressed in fractions containing adipocytes, as compared with stromal-vascular fractions (Fig. 1A). Also, white adipose tissue in mice fed a high-fat diet expressed a much higher level of EPAS1 mRNA compared with that in control mice (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the expression of EPAS1 is increased during adipose differentiation in vivo. EPAS1 was originally identified as the transcriptional factor abundantly expressed in endothelial cells (22Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 23Flamme I. Frohlich T. von Reutern M. Kappel A. Damert A. Risau W. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 24Tian H. McKnight S.L. Russell D.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Thus we compared the expression level of EPAS1 in adipocytes with that in endothelial cells. The level of EPAS1 mRNA expression in adipocytes is as high as that in endothelial cells (Fig. 1C). Then, in the next set of experiments, preadipose 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated to adipocytes by the addition of dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and fetal bovine serum, and the expression of EPAS1 during adipogenesis was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). The adipose differentiation status was confirmed by staining with Oil Red O and by measurement of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity 8 days after induction (data not shown). The level of EPAS1 protein began to increase 6 days after induction and was markedly expressed in the differentiated cells (8 days after induction). Similar to the protein expression levels, EPAS1 mRNA levels increased during adipose differentiation (Fig. 1E). Conversely, expression of HIF-1 α was detected only at the early stage and declined during adipose differentiation (Fig. 1E). To characterize the expression of EPAS1 during adipogenesis, the effects of adipocyte-related transcription factors such as C/EBPs and PPARγs on EPAS1 promoter activity were examined (Fig. 1F). Luciferase activity driven by the EPAS1 promoter was increased by C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ, whereas C/EBPα and PPARγs had little or no effect on this activity (Fig. 1F). Expression of the Dominant Negative Form of EPAS1 Inhibits Adipose Differentiation in 3T3-L1 Cells—To examine whether EPAS1 exerts an influence on adipogenesis, we first constructed an EPAS1 C-terminal deletion mutant (designated EPAS 1-(1–485)) that lacked a transactivation domain. EPAS1-(1–485) forms a heterodimer with ARNT and binds to the hypoxia-responsive element sequence (32Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this mutated EPAS1 lacks the ability to transactivate HRE-driven transcription (Fig. 2A; Ref. 32Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-expression of EPAS1-(1–485) suppressed the induction of HRE-driven transcription by full-length EPAS1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A), indicating that EPAS1-(1–485) functioned as a dominant negative mutant. Although EPAS1-(1–485) also inhibits HIF-1α-dependent transcriptional activity in vitro (data not shown), the expression pattern of EPAS1 is distinct from that of HIF-1α during adipogenesis (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, HIF-1α protein is unstable due to oxygen-dependent ubiquitination under normoxia conditions, whereas EPAS1 protein is expressed at constant levels regardless of oxygenation (33Park S. Dadak A.M. Hasse V.H. Fontana L. Giaccia A.J. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4959-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Ouiddir A. Planes C. Fernandes I. Van Hesse A. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of EPAS1-(1–485) observed in this study are most likely on EPAS1 activity, but not HIF-1α activity. We then isolated stable clones from 3T3-L1 cells in which we could induce the expression of EPAS1-(1–485) with insect hormone (Pon.A) (Fig. 2B). This system allows us to directly examine the roles of EPAS1 without relying on pharmacological agents or hypoxia conditions that might regulate other signaling pathways and transcriptional activities. Treatment of the control 3T3-L1 cells with Pon.A had no effect on the differentiation states, as judged by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 2C). Conversely, the induction of EPAS1-(1–485) allowed cells to accumulate only minimum amounts of intracellular lipid droplets (Fig. 2, C and D). These results were confirmed by measuring the expression of adipocyte-related genes, such as PPARγ2 and the C/EBP family. As expected, the expression of these genes was strongly induced in the control cells during differentiation (Fig. 2D). In contrast, consistent with the morphological observations, minimum amounts of PPARγ2 and C/EBP family were induced in the EPAS1-(1–485)-expressing cells. Consequently, these results indicated that EPAS1 plays a role for execution of the adipose differentiation program in 3T3-L1 cells. The Combination of the PPARγ Activator and a Conventional Differentiation Mixture Restores the Ability of EPAS1-(1–485)-expressing Cells to Differentiate—Activation of PPARγ with ligands such as thiazolidinediones can promote adipose differentiation. Therefore, we chose to examine whether or not the activation of PPARγ would be able to restore the differentiation potential of EPAS1-(1–485)-expressing cells. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2, the induction of EPAS1-(1–485) with PonA resulted in a lower differentiation morphology (Fig. 3, middle row). However, treatment with troglitazone allowed the EPAS1-(1–485)-expressing cells to accumulate lipid droplets to the same extent as that of the control cells in the presence of PonA (Fig. 3, bottom row). Similarly, co-treatment with the conventional differentiation mixture containing ciglitazone or indomethacin restored the ability of the cells to differentiate (data not shown). Ectopic Expression of EPAS1 in NIH 3T3 Cells Stimulates Adipose Differentiation—The results described above demonstrated that EPAS1 plays a role in adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Then, we wished to examine whether EPAS1 has the ability to promote adipogenesis in NIH 3T3 cells, a relatively nonadipogenic cell line. NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with either a control vector or a vector expressing high levels of full-length EPAS1 mRNA. After the selection and expansion of stable clones, the level of the EPAS1 protein was examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the cells transfected with the vector expressing EPAS1 mRNA produced more EPAS1 protein than did the control vector-transfected cells. To evaluate the differentiation potency of the clones, the cells were cultured to confluence and then treated with a standard differentiation medium containing PPARγ2 ligand (troglitazone or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid). The extent of differentiation was estimated by adipose staining with Oil"

The three human isoforms of PPARα, -δ, and -γ (NR1C1, NR1C2, and NR1C3, respectively) show distinct patterns of tissue distribution and ligand preference and control different biological activities. PPARα is a regulator of fatty acid catabolism in the liver (10Dreyer C. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Laudet V. Krey G. Wahli W. Biol.

The use of synthetic PPAR ligands has demonstrated the importance of these receptors in the regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis and today PPARs are established molecular targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The thiazolidinediones (TZDs), used pharmaceutically as insulin sensitizers, are known activators of PPARγ (15Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J.

It is generally believed that agonist binding to NRs induces changes in the dynamics and position of helix 12, which in turn facilitates the recruitment of coactivator proteins resulting in an activation of the transcriptional machinery. The ligand-binding pockets of PPAR LBDs are larger than for other NRs and, as shown for the PPARγ-GW0072 complex (24Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E.

The GW0072 compound is a poor transactivator and can antagonize TZD-driven adipocyte differentiation (24Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M.

A. 1999; 96: 6102-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the specific hydrogen bonding interactions seen between the agonists and AF2 could act as a necessary molecular switch for transactivation to occur (22Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Collins J.B. Oplinger J.A. Kliewer S.A. Gampe R.T. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In opposition to this hypothesis we here describe a new class of PPAR agonists, the 5-substituted 2-benzoylaminobenzoic acids (2-BABAs), which act by binding at the entrance of the ligand pocket and activate the receptor without a direct interaction with helix 12. The 2-BABA compound BVT.13, which selectively activates PPARγ with a similar maximal efficacy as rosiglitazone, was shown to have antidiabetic effects in ob/ob mice. Compounds—The compounds BVT.13, BVT.762, and BVT.763 (see Fig. 1a) were synthesized as described earlier (25Thor M. Beierlein K. Dykes G. Gustavsson A-L. Heidrich J. Jendeberg L. Lindqvist B. Pegurier C. Roussel P. Slater M. Svensson S. Sydow-Bäckman M. Thornström U. Uppenberg J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 3565-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). GW2331, rosiglitazone, and SR12813 were synthesized in our laboratory. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol was purchased from Sigma, and WY14.643 was purchased from Alexis. Expression and Isolation of hPPARγ-LBD—A construct described previously and used for the crystallization of the apoPPARγ-LBD (26Uppenberg J. Svensson C. Jaki M. Bertilsson G. Jendeberg L.

The expression and isolation protocol was performed as described previously (26Uppenberg J. Svensson C. Jaki M. Bertilsson G. Jendeberg L. Berkenstam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31108-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), except for the addition of an ion exchange (Resource Q, pH 8.0) and a molecular sieving step (Superdex 75) after the first crude immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography step. Isolated PPARγ-LBD was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to 9 mg/ml. The engineered protease cleavage site was not used but may have facilitated crystal packing. Crystallography—Crystals of the PPARγ-LBD in complex were grown by the hanging drop diffusion method at 18 °C and appeared in 3-5 days. The well solution contained 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 22% polyethylene glycol 3000, and 0.2 m calcium acetate. Typically, 3 μl of the precipitant was mixed with 3 μl of a solution containing 9 mg/ml PPARγ-LBD, 1 mm glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1 (GRIP-1) coactivator peptide (KEKHKILHRLLQDS), and 1 mm ligand in the drop. Crystals were mounted in glass capillaries and diffracted at most to 2.8 Å. All data were collected at room temperature using a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode with Molecular Structure Corp. mirrors and a Raxis4 image plate detector. The data were processed with DENZO and Scalepack (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121, having the approximate unit cell lengths of 49, 67, and 123 Å, containing 1 monomer/asymmetric unit. The structures were solved by molecular replacement with coordinates from the PDB entry 3PRG, using the AMoRe program package (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Model building was performed using the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), and the models were refined using simulated annealing and restrained B factor refinement included in CNS software (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). For all structures, both the ligand and the coactivator peptide could easily be modeled according to the difference electron density maps. The final models contain ligand, the amino acids HKILHRLLQ of the coactivator peptide, the introduced protease cleavage site, and the complete PPARγ-LBD except for 11 residues (amino acids 263-273) in the BVT.762 and BVT.763 complexes and 6 residues (amino acids 268-273) in the BVT.13 complex.

The LBDs were subcloned in-frame into the pCMXGal4 vector, containing the GAL4-DBD (31Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The 4xGAL4-RE luciferase reporter plasmid has been described previously (31Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Cell-based Reporter Gene Assays—Transient transfection experiments for the analysis of PPAR activation were performed in CaCo-2 subclone TC7 cells (CaCo-2/TC7, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line) in 96-well plates. For batch transfections, cells were seeded at a concentration of 4.0 × 106 cells/225 cm2 and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (SVA, Sweden), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen) (10 ml/liter), and l-glutamine (Invitrogen) (20 ml/liter). After 24 h the medium was replaced with transfection medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS, nonessential amino acids (10 ml/liter) and l-glutamine (20 ml/liter). The cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of receptor plasmid and 50 μg of reporter plasmid using Dospher (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5-6 h, medium was replaced. Following 20-24 h, cells were seeded at a concentration of 0.25 × 105 cells/well in induction medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% charcoal/dextran FBS, nonessential amino acids (10 ml/L), and l-glutamine (20 ml/L), incubated for ∼5 h, and subsequently treated with the compounds in optimized serial dilutions as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2a. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested in lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100), and the cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity using a Luciferase assay kit (BioThema AB, Sweden). All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. For curve fitting, Xlfit version 3.0.2 was used. An analysis of the effects of the 2-BABA compounds in the presence of rosiglitazone was essentially performed as described above with the following exceptions; the transfection and induction media used were Optimem (Invitrogen) with 10 or 5% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS, respectively. The transfection agent used was FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). Transient transfection experiments for the analysis of BVT.13 selectivity were performed in CaCo-2/TC7 cells in 6-well plates. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells in each well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of growth medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids (10 ml/liter), and l-glutamine (20 ml/liter). The medium was replaced with 2 ml of transfection medium (Optimem, Invitrogen) with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS), and the cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of Gal4RE-luciferase reporter and 0.2 μg of pCMXGal4-receptor plasmid (where the LBD of the respective receptor is fused to the Gal4 DBD) using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 20-24 h, the medium was replaced (Optimem with 2% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS), and the cells were treated with BVT.13 (10 or 1 μm) or positive controls as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Me2SO was used as a control. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were harvested, and the cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity. All experiments were performed twice in duplicate. In Vivo Studies—Male ob/ob mice (age 10-12 weeks, C57BL/6Jbom-ob/ob (Lepob), Taconic, Denmark) were housed in individual cages and allowed free access to normal rodent (mouse) chow (R34; Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden) and tap water. The mice were maintained at a temperature of 22 ± 3 °C and a humidity of 50 ± 20% on a fixed 12-h light/dark cycle. Before the start of treatment the animals were grouped based on nonfasting blood glucose measured from tail vein samples. Each treatment group consisted of 10 animals. The animals were orally dosed once a day for 7 days (vehicle 10% w/v polyethylene glycol 400 and 0.1% w/v Tween 80). The dose volume of BVT.13 was 10 ml/kg of body weight, yielding doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg. Three animals were added to the 100-mg/kg dose group for a kinetic study. Rosiglitazone was used as a positive control at a dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Food and body weights were registered at the start of dosing. On day eight, orbital blood samples were taken in EDTA vials on wet ice and centrifuged at 4 °C at 400 rpm for 10 min to obtain EDTA plasma. Plasma samples were kept at -20 °C until analyzed. Plasma glucose was determined using glucose GHD Unimate 7 kit (Roche Applied Science). Plasma triglycerides and serum-free fatty acids were determined using triglycerides/GB (Roche Applied Science) and NEFAC (WAKO) assay kits. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (Mercodia) was used to measure plasma insulin. Concentrations of BVT.13, in dosing solutions and mouse plasma, were determined by on-line solid phase extraction coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. The procedures involving animals were in conformity with national and international laws for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the local animal ethical committee. Identification of a Novel Class of PPAR Ligands—The parent 2-BABA scaffold (BVT.142) was identified as a PPARγ ligand and activator as described previously (25Thor M. Beierlein K. Dykes G. Gustavsson A-L. Heidrich J. Jendeberg L. Lindqvist B. Pegurier C. Roussel P. Slater M. Svensson S. Sydow-Bäckman M. Thornström U. Uppenberg J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 3565-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An initial expansion around this scaffold yielded 250 compounds, where the agonists BVT.13, BVT.762, and BVT.763 were substituted in the 5-position with 2-pyrimidinyloxy, 2-thienylmethoxy, and 2-(3-thienyl)ethoxy, respectively (Fig. 1a). These compounds were chosen as good representatives based on both chemical and preclinical properties. Structural Analysis of Cocrystal Complexes—Initial docking studies of the 2-BABA scaffold to the apoPPARγ-LBD structure (26Uppenberg J. Svensson C. Jaki M. Bertilsson G. Jendeberg L. Berkenstam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31108-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in combination with the bioisosteric properties of the TZD headgroup and carboxylate group of the 2-BABA compounds suggested an anchoring mode similar to that of eicosapentaenoic acid to PPARδ (5Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Lehmann J.M. Wisely G.B. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Milburn M.V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), with the carboxylic headgroup interacting with Tyr-473 in helix 12. To further elucidate this hypothesis, the crystal structures of BVT.13, BVT.762, and BVT.763 in complex with PPARγ-LBD and a GRIP-1-derived coactivator peptide were solved by molecular replacement. Resolutions of the complexes were 2.8, 3.15, and 2.9 Å, respectively (Table I). The overall fold of the PPARγ-LBD shows only minor differences as compared with the previously determined apoPPARγ structure (26Uppenberg J. Svensson C. Jaki M. Bertilsson G. Jendeberg L. Berkenstam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31108-31112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The major differences are in the region connecting helix 2′ and helix 3, a region with high mobility. The 2-BABA complexes superimpose well with the apoPPARγ-LBD structure, resulting in a root mean square deviation of 0.8 Å over 260 C-α atoms (Protein Data Bank accession code 3PRG). Surprisingly, the crystal structures reveal that the three agonists lack a direct interaction with helix 12. The 2-BABA ligands are located in an elongated conformation of the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 1, b and c) and they occupy a region in proximity with and approximately parallel to helix 3 and in proximity to β-strand 3 and helices 5 and 2′. The interactions of the molecule with the protein can be divided into four groups. The first group is formed by the interactions to the dichloro-phenyl moiety. This moiety is located in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket of the receptor. Principal interactions are hydrophobic in nature and formed by the side chains of Arg-288, Ala-292, Ile-326, Met-329, Leu-330, and Leu-333 (Fig. 1d). The second group of interactions is formed between the carbonyl oxygen on the peptide linker of the ligand and the side chain sulfur and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Cys-285. The third group is made up of interactions between the central benzoic acid moiety and the protein. This moiety is located in a narrow groove of the protein formed by the side chains of Cys-285, Arg-288, Ile-341, and Met-364, and the backbone atoms of Gly-284, Cys-285, and Ser-342. The interactions are hydrophobic in nature with the exception of a distinct hydrogen bond formed between the backbone nitrogen of Ser-342 and one of the carboxylate oxygens of the ligand (Fig. 1d). The fourth group of interactions is formed between the heterocyclic ring and the protein. These are also predominantly hydrophobic in nature, where the protein atoms involved belong to the side chains and backbone of Leu-255, Arg-280, and Ile-281. The pyrimidine ring of BVT.13 has additional interactions with Phe-264 and His-266, residues that are situated in the part of the loop connecting helix 2′ and helix 3, which is structured in the BVT.13 complex but not in the other two complexes. The GRIP-1 coactivator peptide is bound in a helical conformation in the predominantly hydrophobic groove formed by helices 3-5 and 12 (AF2), a binding mode identical to that seen for the steroid receptor coactivator 1 helix in the PPARγ-rosiglitazone complex (21Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). As described previously, Lys-301 and Glu-471 of the LBD stabilize the dipole moment of the coactivator helix by forming a charge clamp (21Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced Transcriptional Activation—To evaluate the ability of BVT.13, BVT.762, and BVT.763 to transcriptionally activate PPARγ and PPARα, a cell-based reporter gene assay was employed. CaCo-2/TC7 cells were transiently transfected with chimeric Gal4-DBD/PPAR-LBD receptors and a 4xGAL4-RE reporter plasmid and subsequently treated with BVT.13, BVT.762, BVT.763 or rosiglitazone in optimized serial dilutions. A strong ligand-dependent activation of PPARγ, with a relative efficacy of ∼80% compared with rosiglitazone, was seen for all three compounds (Fig. 2a). The calculated EC50 values were 1.3, 0.3, and 0.8 μm, respectively (25Thor M. Beierlein K. Dykes G. Gustavsson A-L. Heidrich J. Jendeberg L. Lindqvist B. Pegurier C. Roussel P. Slater M. Svensson S. Sydow-Bäckman M. Thornström U. Uppenberg J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 3565-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). BVT.762 and BVT.763 induced the transcriptional activity of PPARα to a similar efficacy as seen for PPARγ but displayed EC50 values of 5 and 3.8 μm, respectively (25Thor M. Beierlein K. Dykes G.

Furthermore, the 2-BABA compounds were not able to antagonize the activity of 30 nm rosiglitazone in the cell-based reporter gene assay (Fig. 2b). To further determine the specificity of BVT.13, a set of NR LBDs were analyzed in cell-based reporter gene assays. Transcriptional activation by BVT.13 was shown to be selective for the mouse and human PPARγ isoforms (Fig. 3). Pharmac"

Here we report the determination of the YiiP oligomeric state in detergent-lipid micelles and in membranes. Molecular masses of YiiP solubilized with dodecyl-, undecyl-, decyl-, or nonyl-β-d-maltoside were measured directly using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with laser light-scattering photometry, yielding a mass distribution of YiiP homo-oligomers within a narrow range (68.0–68.8 kDa) that equals the predicted mass of a YiiP dimer within experimental error. The detergent-lipid masses associated with YiiP in the mixed micelles were found to increase from 135.5 to 232.6 kDa, with an apparent correlation with the alkyl chain length of the maltoside detergents. Cross-linking the detergent-solubilized YiiP with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) resulted in a dimeric cross-linked product in an EDC concentration-dependent manner. The oligomeric state of the purified YiiP in reconstituted membranes was determined by electron microscopic analysis of two-dimensional YiiP crystals in negative stain. A projection structure calculated from measurable optical diffractions to 25 Å revealed a pseudo-2-fold symmetry within a molecular boundary of ∼75 × 40 Å, indicative of the presence of YiiP dimers in membranes. These data provide direct structural evidence for a dimeric association of YiiP both in detergent-lipid micelles and in the reconstituted lipid bilayer.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Analysis of genome sequences shows that CDFs represent a ubiquitous protein family, encompassing more than 400 evolutionarily related members found from bacteria and yeast to plants and mammals (3Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 138-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein family is characterized by an N-terminal hydrophobic domain followed by a C-terminal hydrophilic region that is highly variable both in sequence and in length (4Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Despite large variability in the hydrophilic region, all CDF family members identified so far, prokaryotic or eukaryotic, are predominantly involved in controls of cytosolic zinc buildup during zinc excesses, either by facilitating zinc efflux from cytosol to the outside of cells or by transporting the cytosolic zinc into intracellular organelles (5Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Nagao M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This zinc-transporting function is attributed to the homologous hydrophobic domain, which is thought to be composed of a bundle of six transmembrane segments in an α-helical configuration, a structural theme found in many other membrane channels and transporters, including those in the aquaporin family (6Agre P. Bonhivers M. Borgnia M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14659-14662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and those within the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily (7Tomii K. Kanehisa M. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The order of subunit oligomerization is an important structural parameter in connection with subunit arrangements and mechanisms of transmembrane activities. Crystal structures of aquaporins revealed a tetrameric structure with four independent transmembrane channels located in the center of each monomer (8Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), whereas an ABC transporter MsbA was found to be a dimer with a substrate translocation pathway along the dimeric interface (9Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Different oligomeric structures of these membrane proteins illustrate how transmembrane active sites may evolve differently from a common six-spanner architecture. Consequently, subunit oligomerization may contribute to the molecular architecture of transmembrane channels and translocation pathways that constitute the structural basis for distinctive transmembrane functions; aquaporins are selective pores that allow transmembrane permeation of water and glycerol by simple diffusion (10Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas ABC transporters actively move diverse substrates across the membrane at the expense of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis (11Hyde S.C. Emsley P. Hartshorn M.J. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Pearce S.R. Gallagher M.P. Gill D.R. Hubbard R.E. Higgins C.F. Nature. 1990; 346: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). CDFs operate with an antiport mechanism that utilizes the potential energy in the form of a transmembrane proton gradient to drive the movement of zinc in a reverse direction (2Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Lee S.M. Grass G. Haney C.J. Fan B. Rosen B.P. Anton A. Nies D.H. Rensing C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 273-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric state of CDF transporters has not yet been established, and little is known about the structure of any CDF besides the fact that most CDFs are predicted to be six-spanning membrane proteins (4Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, determining the quaternary structure of a CDF transporter is paradigmatic for understanding the structural basis of zinc transport. Two Escherichia coli CDF proteins, YiiP and ZitB, provide unique models for the study of CDFs at the molecular level. The N-terminal hydrophobic domain of YiiP contains ∼200 amino acids followed by a C-terminal hydrophilic region of ∼100 amino acids. Chromosomal expression of both E. coli CDFs was found to be inducible by zinc in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that both CDFs are involved in zinc homeostatic controls against environmental zinc fluctuation (13Grass G. Fan B. Rosen B.P. Franke S. Nies D.H. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4664-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). YiiP and ZitB were overexpressed, solubilized by non-ionic detergents, and purified to homogeneity in mixed micelles with detergents and lipids. The purified protein, which appeared to be in a native-like state, was reconstituted into the lipid bilayer and subjected to stopped-flow kinetic analysis (2Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The transport of zinc through ZitB was found to be a two-step kinetic process involving an equilibrium metal binding followed by a proton-linked transport that moves the bound metal ion across the membrane. As such, an inwardly orientated proton gradient across the plasma membrane of E. coli serves as the driving force for the efflux of the cytoplasmic zinc. Further mechanistic studies by isothermal titration calorimetry with purified YiiP revealed a mutually competitive binding site common to Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ and a set of non-competitive binding sites (1Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to determine the oligomeric state of YiiP in an effort to gain structural insights into zinc transport by CDFs. The oligomeric state of YiiP could be derived from molecular mass measurements (14Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Previous studies with analytical SEC showed that the purified YiiP was eluted as a major monodisperse species with a retention time corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 190 kDa (2Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Any oligomeric state of YiiP from a dimeric to a tetrameric form could account for this apparent molecular mass because the retention time, a measure of protein Stoke's radius and geometry, could vary considerably depending on the amount of detergents and lipids bound to YiiP. To determine definitively the molecular mass of YiiP oligomers in mixed micelles, we used an absolute mass analysis method based on size-exclusion HPLC in conjunction with simultaneous detections of ultraviolet absorption (UV), laser light-scattering (LS), and differential refractive index (RI) of the column effluent (15Hayashi Y. Matsui H. Takagi T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This UV-LS-RI method yielded molecular mass estimates for YiiP oligomers in mixed micelles irrespective of the size, shape, and lipid-detergent constituent of the mixed micelles. Another advantage of this light-scattering analysis method is its applicability to unstable membrane proteins that tend to denature rapidly in detergent micelles. HPLC runs and molecular mass calculations can be completed within 30 min, representing a clear improvement over the analytical ultracentrifugation method that requires several days to attain sedimentation equilibrium (16Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4467-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Here we describe the molecular mass analysis of YiiP oligomers in mixed micelles with endogenous lipids and four maltoside detergents. The protein masses found were approximately equal to the expected molecular mass of a YiiP dimer. The detergent-lipid masses associated with the YiiP dimer in the mixed micelles varied according to the type of the maltoside detergent. To further characterize the oligomeric state of YiiP in mixed micelles, chemical cross-linking was employed using a zero-spacer cross-linker EDC (17Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Because the subunit organization in the membrane environment may be different from that in the detergent-solubilized form, the quaternary structure of YiiP was also studied for the membrane-embedded state by two-dimensional crystallization of YiiP and electron microscopic imaging (18Werten P.J. Remigy H.W. de Groot B.L. Fotiadis D. Philippsen A. Stahlberg H. Grubmuller H. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that YiiP is a dimer both in detergent-lipid micelles and in membranes. Overexpression and Purification of YiiP—YiiP was overexpressed and purified as described (1Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, a frozen stock of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) containing pYiiP-TB-His plasmids was inoculated into an auto-inducing medium for unattended induction of protein overexpression. The overnight culture was harvested, and membrane vesicles were prepared and then subjected to detergent solubilization using n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM, Anatrace, Maumee, OH). The detergent-solubilized YiiP-TB-His was purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by a desalting step to remove imidazole that was present in the eluate of the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Next the His tag was removed by overnight thrombin digestion, and the resultant YiiP was further purified by size-exclusion HPLC using a TSK 3000SWXL column (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA) equilibrated with the following mobile phase: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, and 0.25 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TECP)). The column effluent was monitored by a UV detector (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and the purified YiiP was collected as a discrete chromatographic fraction using a Beckman SC100 fraction collector. Sample Preparation for Light-scattering Experiments—All protein samples for light-scattering experiments were adjusted to ∼1.0 mg/ml, dialyzed against the HPLC mobile phase at 10 °C using a 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff DispoDialyzer (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA), and then centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 30 min to remove any precipitate. The mobile phase was also filtered with a 0.22-μm Millipore GS filter and degassed thoroughly. For light-scattering experiments with different detergents, protein samples were dialyzed with frequent changes of the dialysis bulk solution containing one of the following four detergents as indicated: 0.05% DDM, 0.06% undecyl-maltoside (UDM), 0.15% decyl-maltoside (DM) or 0.4% nonyl-maltoside (NM). For light-scattering experiments with YiiP delipidated to varied levels, samples were prepared by passing YiiP through the TSK column successively and collecting the eluted YiiP peak at each passage. Size-exclusion Chromatography and Multiangle Laser Light-scattering Measurement—The instrument setup used for SEC-light scattering experiments consisted of a System-Gold HPLC system (Beckman Coulter) connected in series with a DAWN DSP light-scattering detector (Wyatt Technology) and an OPTILAB DSP RI interferometric refractometer detector (Wyatt Technology). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed at 20 °C using an TSK 3000SWXL column (TosoHaas) equilibrated with a mobile phase containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.25 mm TECP and one of the follow detergents as indicated: 0.05% DDM, 0.06% UDM, 0.15% DM, or 0.4% NM. 100 μl of purified YiiP sample at ∼1.0 mg/ml was injected into the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column effluent was monitored in-line with three detectors that simultaneously monitored UV absorption, light scattering, and refractive index, respectively. The resultant three chromatograms were aligned with that of the LS output after corrections for the interdetector volume delays between the UV-to-LS and RI-to-LS detector. Detector outputs were digitized and acquired by a Pentium workstation running Astra software (Wyatt Technology). Calculation of the Protein Core Mass in Protein-Detergent-Lipid Micelles—It has been established that the angular dependence of scattered light can be ignored for globular proteins with molecular masses smaller than 5000 kDa (19Takagi T. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 506: 409-416Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of YiiP-detergent-lipid micelles was estimated to be 190 kDa by analytical size-exclusion chromatography. The corresponding SEC light-scattering data, collected simultaneously at 16 different angles between 14 and 163°, remained unchanged within experimental error. Thus, the scattering light signal measured at 90° was used in approximation for all calculations. The second virial coefficient term in the protein mass calculation can also be ignored at protein concentrations encountered in the chromatographic analysis (20Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Based on these two approximations, the molecular mass of YiiP (Mp) in protein-detergent-lipid micelles can be determined by a three-detector method (15Hayashi Y. Matsui H. Takagi T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using the equation, Mp=k1(output)LS(output)UVA(output)RI2(Eq. 1) where k1 is an instrument response factor, (output)LS, (output)UV and (output)RI are elution peak intensities, obtained in the unit of volt by the LS, UV, and RI detector, and A is the extinction coefficient of the protein. Calculation of the Detergent-Lipid Mass in Protein-Detergent-Lipid Micelles—The amount of detergent and lipid bound to the solubilized YiiP can be calculated according to the value of differential refractive index (dnc/dcp), which is defined as the ratio of the change in refractive index of the protein-detergent-lipid complex to the change of the protein concentration. Thus, (dnc/dcP)=k2A(output)RI(output)UV(Eq. 2) where k2 is an instrument response factor (15Hayashi Y. Matsui H. Takagi T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The value of dnc/dcp is the sum of weighted contributions of three components in the protein-detergent-lipid ternary complex (15Hayashi Y. Matsui H. Takagi T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The differential refractive index of YiiP (dnp/dcp) is assumed to be 0.187 ml/g, a constant known for all regular proteins (15Hayashi Y. Matsui H. Takagi T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The differential refractive indexes of detergents (dnd/dcd) and lipids (dnl/dcl) were determined experimentally. Therefore, the weight ratios of the bound detergents δd and lipids δl (g/g of YiiP) in the YiiP-detergent-lipid micelles can be derived according to Equation 3. (dnc/dcP)=0.187+δd(dnd/dcd)+δl(dnl/dcl)(Eq. 3) Measurements of the Extinction Coefficient A and Instrument Response Factors k1 and k2—Protein concentrations in the detergent solution were estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce). The UV absorption at 280 nm of the identical protein sample was measured, and the extinction coefficient A was calculated as the ratio of the optical density at 280 nm to the value obtained by the BCA assay. k1 and k2 values were determined by calibrating detector outputs using Equation 1 or 2 to match the Mp or dnc/dcp value with the respective value of GlpF, a tetrameric integral membrane protein calibrator that can be purified as a monodisperse species in the identical detergent condition used for light-scattering analysis of YiiP. Briefly, 100 μl of purified GlpF at 1 mg/ml was injected into the size-exclusion column, and the outputs of UV, LS, and RI detector were recorded. k1 was calculated based on Equation 1 using the theoretical molecular mass for GlpF tetramer (116 kDa) and an extinction coefficient A of 1.74 ml/mg. The k2 value was obtained according to Equation 2, where the dnc/dcp value for GlpF was determined off-line using the OPTILAB DSP RI detector operating in a batch mode. The refractive index nc of the GlpF-detergent-lipid micellar complex was recorded at five different GlpF concentrations. The value for dnc/dcp was derived from the slope of the plot: nc versus the GlpF concentration. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—A α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was prepared as a saturated solution in a 2:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water. Aliquots of protein in a series of 1:2 dilutions were mixed with the matrix solution and then spotted onto a sample plate using the sandwich method (21Beavis R. Chait B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 70: 519-551Crossref Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometric data were collected using a Voyager Biospectrotometry Work station, operated in linear mode. EDC Cross-linking—The HPLC-purified YiiP samples were dialyzed overnight to equilibrate with the following EDC reaction buffer: 100 mm MES, pH 5.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CdSO4, 0.05% DDM, 20% glycerol, and 0.25 mm TECP. Cross-linking reactions were initiated by adding EDC to 1.0 mg/ml YiiP to a final concentration as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h, and then β-mercaptoethanol was added to 100 mm to terminate the reactions. The resultant reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 h, and then supernatants were injected to an TSK column that was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% DDM, 12.5% glycerol, and 0.25 mm TECP. Column effluents were monitored by UV absorption, and peak fractions were collected at a retention time corresponding to the peak maximum of the identical YiiP sample before EDC cross-linking. The collected peak fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analyses in the presence of 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and stained with Coomassie Fluor Orange (Molecular Probes) for protein visualization. Two-dimensional Crystallization—The purified YiiP (∼1 mg/ml) was reconstituted with E. coli polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) at various lipid-to-protein ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 (w/w). Lipids were solubilized in 0.05% UDM in a 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.1 mm 0.25 mm TECP. The detergent was slowly removed by dialysis against a bulk pH buffer in a controlled manner over 3–5 days (22Kuhlbrandt W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 429-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional crystals of YiiP with a size ranging from 0.5 to 1 μm were obtained at a lipid-to-protein ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Electron Microscopy and Image Analysis—A 5-μl droplet of the two-dimensional crystal solution was deposited onto a glow-discharged 300-mesh copper grid covered with a thin layer of continuous carbon film. After a 1-min incubation, excess solution on the grid was blotted with a piece of filter paper, and the grid was washed with 2 drops of deionized water, stained with a 2% uranyl acetate aqueous solution for 30s, and then blotted and left to air-dry. Electron microscopy was performed with a Jeol-1200EX microscope, and images were recorded on a Gatan 791 CCD camera. Standard image processing (23Amos L.A. Henderson R. Unwin P.N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1982; 39: 183-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), including determining image defocus values, Fourier transform, indexing reflections, and unbending lattice distortions, were performed on an SGI Fuel work station with the software packages of MRC image2000 (24Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and Spider (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Calibration of the UV-LS-RI System—The instrument response factor k1 was determined by calibrating the outputs of UV, LS, and RI detector according to Equation 1 using GlpF, a 29-kDa aquaporin that was solubilized and purified following the identical procedure employed for the solubilization and purification of YiiP. Size-exclusion HPLC analysis of GlpF revealed a major peak (P1) with a retention time at 15.5 min followed by a minor peak (P2) at 19.5 min (Fig. 1A). It appeared that the LS and RI detector had more pronounced responses to the minor peak; particularly, the height of the RI output at P2 rose to ∼80% of the height at P1. In a set of control experiments, injections of detergent-lipid mixtures only caused base line-level UV responses but elicited significant LS and RI responses in a concentration-dependent manner. It is known that the RI response reflects the concentration of all solutes, including those with and without chromophores, whereas UV absorption is only derived from the UV absorptivity of chromophore-containing species. The negligible UV response to P2 fraction was indicative of a non-protein nature of the P2 fraction, likely attributed to empty detergent-lipid micelles. On the other hand, the P1 fraction with its dual UV and RI responses corresponded to GlpF in mixed micelles with detergents and bound lipids that may have survived the purification process. Therefore, system calibration was carried out using outputs of UV, LS, and RI detectors across the P1 maxima. A k1 value of 115.2 was obtained that allowed the outputs of UV, LS, and RI to be converted to the theoretical value of the GlpF tetrameric molar mass (116 kDa). The instrument response factor k2 was calculated based on an experimentally measured dnc/dcp value of GlpF. Off-line measurements of nc showed a series of plateaus when back-flushing the RI detector with five evenly spaced GlpF dilutions from a 2.4 mg/ml stock solution (Fig. 1B). The RI output collected from each concentration plateau was plotted against the GlpF concentration, producing a value of 0.49 ml/g for dnc/dcp (Fig. 1B, inset). Using this measured dnc/dcp value, a k2 value of 0.13 was obtained that allowed conversion of RI and UV outputs to the actual dnc/dcp value according to Equation 2. Molecular Mass of YiiP Oligomers in Mixed Micelles—YiiP-TB-His was overexpressed, solubilized with DDM, and purified by metal affinity chromatography in the form of (YiiP-TB-His)-DDM-lipid micelles. The His tag was cleaved by thrombin digestion at a cleavage recognition sequence LVPR↓GS that was inserted between the His tag and the C-terminal sequence of YiiP, resulting in a tag-free YiiP variant with a predicted molecular mass of 32.6 kDa. Size-exclusion HPLC analysis of the purified YiiP-DDM-lipid micelles revealed two major chromatographic peaks (P1 and P2) with peak maxima eluted at a retention time of 16.4 and 19.2 min, respectively (Fig. 2A). Compared with the GlpF chromatograms under the identical chromatographic condition, YiiP P1 was characteristic of protein-detergent-lipid micelles with both strong UV and RI responses, whereas YiiP P2 was characteristic of empty detergent-lipid micelles with a strong RI response accompanied by a base-line level UV response. The retention time of YiiP P1 was longer than that of GlpF P1, suggesting a relatively smaller hydrodynamic radius for YiiP-detergent-lipid micelles. Molecular identities of P1 and P2 fractions were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. P1 and P2 fractions were collected and analyzed directly in the presence of detergents and lipids. As shown in Fig. 2B, sample analyzed in this fashion yielded high quality MALDI-MS spectra over a wide range from 0.5 to 40 kDa. Because non-covalent subunit interactions were too weak to survive the MALDI process, the native YiiP oligomer was detected in the form of a monomer. Analysis of P1 fraction revealed two m/z peaks (16289.7, 32556.4) in a higher m/z range, corresponding to the expected m/z values of YiiP in double (16287.5)- and single (32575.0)-charge state. The spectrum at a lower m/z range showed two major mass species of 510.3 and 714.9, consistent with m/z values of the singly charged DDM (510.6) and an E. coli lipid that typically ranges from 700 to 800. Thus, MALDI-TOF analysis confirmed the molecular identity of P1 as mixed micelles of YiiP, DDM, and bound lipids. Analysis of the P2 fraction exhibited an m/z profile in the lower m/z range similar to that of the P1 fraction, but the expected YiiP mass peaks in the higher m/z range were absent. This result confirmed that P2 was composed of empty detergent-lipid micelles. Size-exclusion HPLC in conjunction with simultaneous UV, LS, and RI detections was used to determine molecular masses of the YiiP homo-oligomer in the mixed micelles using the instrument response factor k1 over 15 sampling points across the two chromatographic peaks, P1 (from 16.26 to 16.51 min) and P2 (from 19.05 to 19.30 min) (Fig. 2A). The mass distribution of the YiiP oligomer across P1 appeared to be homogeneous with a range from 64.6 to 70.1 kDa with an average molecular mass of 68.4 ± 1.4 kDa, suggesting that"

Encysted embryos contain an abundant small heat shock protein termed p26, a molecular chaperone that undoubtedly has an important role in development. To understand better the role of p26 in Artemia embryos, the structural and functional characteristics of full-length and truncated p26 expressed in Escherichia coli and COS-1 cells were determined. p26 chaperone activity declined with increasing truncation of the protein, and those deletions with the greatest adverse effect on protection of citrate synthase during thermal stress had the most influence on oligomerization. When produced in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells the p26 α-crystallin domain consisting of amino acid residues 61-152 existed predominantly as monomers, and p26 variants lacking the amino-terminal domain but with intact carboxyl-terminal extensions were mainly monomers and dimers. The amino terminus was, therefore, required for efficient dimer formation. Assembly of higher order oligomers was enhanced by the carboxyl-terminal extension, although removing the 10 carboxyl-terminal residues had relatively little effect on oligomerization and chaperoning. Full-length and carboxyl-terminal truncated p26 resided in the cytoplasm of transfected COS-1 cells; however, variants missing the complete amino-terminal domain and existing predominantly as monomers/dimers entered the nuclei. A mechanism whereby oligomer disassembly assisted entry of p26 into nuclei was suggested, this of importance because p26 translocates into Artemia embryo nuclei during development and stress. However, when examined in Artemia, the p26 oligomer size was unchanged under conditions that allowed movement into nuclei, suggesting a process more complex than just oligomer dissociation.

Domain-specific effects on p26 oligomerization, chaperone activity, and nuclear localization were examined in this study, and the data are related to the structural/functional properties of p26 within oviparously developing Artemia embryos. Cloning of p26 cDNAs—Truncated p26 cDNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), p26-3-6-3 as template (38Liang P.

The truncated p26-3-6-3 cDNAs were recovered from agarose gels with the GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences), inserted into pRSET.C, a polyhistidine-tagged (His-tagged) prokaryotic expression vector linearized by digestion with BamHI and XhoI prior to purification from agarose gels, and cloned in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)PLysS (Invitrogen). Full-length and truncated p26 cDNAs were also generated previously by PCR and inserted into the T/A vector, pCRII (37Crack J.A. Mansour M. Sun Y. MacRae T.H. Eur. J.

The cultures were cooled on ice and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once with extraction/wash buffer (50 mm Na3PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and resuspended in 4 ml of the same buffer prior to the addition of 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma). The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and sonicated three times for 10 s using a Branson Sonifier 150 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) at medium setting with intermittent cooling on ice for 30 s. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants recovered, and protein concentrations ascertained with the Bio-Rad protein determination kit. His-tagged p26 was purified from bacterial extracts using 2-ml BD TALON affinity columns as described by the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). The samples were desalted by dialysis against 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.1, and concentrated with Centriprep YM-10 centrifugal devices (Amicon Bioseparations, Billerica, MA). Bacterial extracts and purified p26 were electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed either by staining with Coomassie Blue or transfer to nitrocellulose. Blots were stained with 2% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 3% trichloroacetic acid to verify protein transfer, washed with TBS-Tween (10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4), and incubated for 45 min with shaking in 5% low fat Carnation milk powder in TBS-Tween. The blots were incubated with OmniProbe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), an anti-His antibody diluted in TBS-Tween, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Mississauga, ON) diluted in TBS-Tween. Protein detection was conducted with the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligomer Formation by Purified p26 —0.5-ml samples of full-length and truncated p26 proteins purified from E. coli were applied to continuous 10-50% (w/v) sucrose gradients and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 21 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor. Tube bottoms were punctured, 0.8-ml fractions collected, and the A280 of each sample measured with a SPECTRAmax PLUS microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The number of p26 monomers/oligomer was calculated using a p26 molecular mass of 20.8 kDa as determined by GENERUNNER with corrections for the addition and deletion of amino acid residues as necessary. α-Lactalbumin (14.2 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (BSA) (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) (Sigma) were centrifuged separately and their locations determined by measuring the A280 of gradient fractions. Chaperone Activity of p26 —A 178 μm stock solution of dimeric citrate synthase (Sigma) was diluted with 40 mm HEPES/KOH buffer at pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 150 nm in 1.0-ml cuvettes and heated at 43 °C with 37.5, 75, 150, 300, and 600 nm purified, bacterially produced p26. p26 molarity in reaction mixtures was based on monomeric molecular masses of p26 variants. Citrate synthase aggregation was monitored by measuring solution turbidity at 360 nm with a SPECTRAmax PLUS spectrophotometer every 2 min for 1 h. BSA (Sigma) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma) were used at 600 nm to evaluate nonspecific protection of citrate synthase. p26 Expression in Transiently Transfected COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells in single T75 culture flasks (BD Biosciences) were transfected with mixtures containing 60 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking serum and antibiotics, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, and 3 μl of SuperFect (Qiagen). Prior to use, transfection mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, then placed in T75 flasks containing cells grown to 60% confluence and incubated at 37 °C. The cells were trypsin treated 24 h after transfection, collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min, incubated on ice for 20 min in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel treatment buffer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal volumes of cell-free extract were electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoprobing of membranes was with OmniProbe as described earlier or with antibody to p26 (39Liang P. Amons R. Clegg J.S. MacRae T.H. J. Biol.

Equal amounts of protein extract from transfected COS-1 cells were applied to individual 10-50% sucrose gradients, prepared by layering 5 ml of 10% (w/v) sucrose on 5 ml of 50% sucrose in 0.1 m Tris/glycine buffer, pH 7.4, in 12-ml tubes, and centrifuging at 200,000 × g for 3 h at 15 °C. The gradients were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 21 h at 4 °C followed by collection of 0.8-ml fractions. 15 μl from each fraction was electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with either anti-p26 antibody or OmniProbe as described previously. Immunolocalization of p26 in Transfected COS-1 Cells—60 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum or antibiotics, 1 μg of plasmid DNA, and 3 μl of SuperFect were mixed for individual wells of 6-well Falcon culture plates (BD Biosciences), incubated at room temperature for 15 min, placed on cells grown to 60% confluence on coverslips in 6-well plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Coverslips were then placed in humidity chambers, rinsed with PBS, and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS, permeabilized 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (PBS-Triton), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with anti-p26 antibody (39Liang P.

The cells were washed three times with PBS-Triton then incubated for 20 min at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in PBS-Triton. After washing three times with PBS-Triton, the cells were incubated with RNase A (Amersham Biosciences) at 5 mg/ml for 10 min and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) at 0.4 mg/ml for 2 min. Coverslips were rinsed with distilled water and placed on Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells expressing His-tagged p26 fusion proteins were also stained with OmniProbe diluted in PBS-Triton, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunofluorescently stained cells were examined with a Zeiss 410 confocal laser scanning microscope. Effect of pH on p26 Oligomers—Encysted Artemia embryos (cysts) (INVE Aquaculture, Inc., Ogden, UT) were hydrated in distilled water at 4 °C for 3 h, collected on a Buchner funnel, washed with cold distilled water, and homogenized with a Retsch motorized mortar and pestle (Brinkmann Instruments) in Pipes buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1mm MgCl2) at either pH 6.5 or 7.0. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were passed through two layers of Miracloth (Calbiochem) before centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The upper two-thirds of each supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and recentrifuged. Either immediately after preparation or after incubation at room temperature for 30 min, supernatants were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C in 10-50% continuous sucrose gradients at the pH used for homogenization. The gradients were fractionated, and samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-p26 antibody. Effect of Heat Shock on p26 Oligomers—10 g of Artemia cysts in 500 ml of distilled H2O was brought to 22 °C, then heated to 50 °C over 1 h with vigorous aeration in a Programmable/Digital Immersion Circulator (VWR, Mississauga, ON). Heat-shocked and control cysts, the latter incubated on ice for 30 min, were homogenized separately by hand for 2 min in a chilled mortar and pestle in 35 ml of cold HPC (1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm PIPES, 6.4% hexylene glycol, pH 7.0), followed by one passage in a Dounce homogenizer, filtration through Miracloth, and centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei. Supernatants were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the upper two-thirds was placed in a fresh tube and centrifuged. Supernatants were centrifuged in 10-50% continuous sucrose gradients, fractionated, and analyzed on Western blots after SDS-PAGE. The nuclei-containing pellets from above were rinsed twice with 40 ml of HPC, resuspended in 17.5 ml of the same buffer, applied to 25-ml cushions of 75% (v/v) Percoll (Sigma) in 150 mm NaCl, 14 mm MgCl2, 16 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JS-13.1 swinging bucket rotor. Cloudy layers were transferred to fresh tubes, brought to 15 ml with HPC, placed on a 25-ml Percoll cushion, and centrifuged as above. Nuclei were recovered, mixed with an equal volume of HPC, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the nuclei-containing pellets were suspended in 1.0 ml of HPC. Samples were stained with 0.4% DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined microscopically. Nuclei from control and heat-shocked embryos were lysed in treatment buffer, electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-p26 antibody to determine whether p26 had moved into nuclei. For sucrose density gradient centrifugation, extracts were prepared by suspending purified nuclei in 1.0 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and sonicating three times for 10 s using a Branson Sonifier 150 at medium setting with intermittent cooling on ice for 30 s. The sonicated samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were centrifuged in 10-50% continuous sucrose gradients at 200,000 × g for 12 h at 4 °C. The gradients were fractionated, and samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibody to localize p26. Cloning of p26 cDNAs—Full-length and truncated p26 cDNAs cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pRSET.C included p26-full-His, the full-length polypeptide; p26-NΔ36-His, residues 1-36 deleted; p26-NΔ60-His, residues 1-60 removed; p26-CΔ40-His, final 40 residues eliminated; p26-CΔ10-His, lacked the last 10 residues; p26-α-His, missing residues 1-60 and 153-192, thereby consisting of the α-crystallin domain (Fig. 1). All p26 cDNAs generated by site-directed mutagenesis contained, in addition to the p26 sequence, an amino-terminal peptide of 13 residues encoded by p26-3-6-3 and the His tag. The presence of the His tag is indicated by “-His” in the name of the p26 cDNA or protein. The p26 cDNAs recovered from the storage vector pCRII (37Crack J.A. Mansour M. Sun Y. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 933-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were cloned in pSecCMV for expression in COS-1 cells. p26-full, p26-NΔ60, and p26-α were also prepared in pcDNA4/His.A for expression as His-tagged fusion proteins. All cloned p26 cDNA fragments were sized by electrophoresis in agarose after restriction digestion of recombinant plasmids, and PCR fidelity was confirmed by sequencing all cloned inserts (not shown). p26 Oligomer Formation and Chaperone Activity—Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of transformed E. coli yielded polypeptides on Western blots of the appropriate size that reacted strongly with OmniProbe, although bands corresponding to p26 were not readily visible in Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig. 2, a and b). With the exception of p26-NΔ60-His and p26-α-His, all of the polypeptides we"

Coffman R.L. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 111-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce IFNγ, and direct cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and are involved in humoral immunity and allergic reactions. The direction of Th cell differentiation depends on the cytokine environment (2Seder R.A.

The IL-12-mediated activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 4 is crucial for Th1 cell differentiation, while IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation is for Th2 cell development (7Gately M.K.

In addition to the cytokines mentioned above, TCR stimulation by antigens also influences the direction of Th1/Th2 cell differentiation. We reported that efficient TCR-mediated activation of the p56lck, calcineurin, and Ras-ERK MAPK signaling cascade was required for Th2 cell differentiation (10Yamashita M. Hashimoto K. Kimura M. Kubo M. Tada T. Nakayama T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Yamashita M. Kimura M. Kubo M. Shimizu C. Tada T. Perlmutter R.M. Nakayama T. Proc. Natl.

GATA3 is selectively expressed in Th2 cells, and its ectopic expression induces Th2 cell differentiation even in the absence of STAT6 (15Zhang D.H. Cohn L. Ray P. Bottomly K. Ray A. J. Biol.

Med. 2000; 192: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Changes in the chromatin structure of the Th2 cytokine (IL-4/IL-5/IL-13) gene loci occur during Th2 cell differentiation (19Lohning M. Richter A. Radbruch A. Adv. Immunol. 2002; 80: 115-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that covalent modifications of histones play critical roles in epigenetic regulation (21Turner B.M. Cell. 2002; 111: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others (22Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) demonstrated that histone hyperacetylation of the Th2 cytokine gene loci occurs in developing Th2 cells in a Th2-specific and STAT6-dependent manner. Also, we demonstrated an essential role for GATA3 in Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation (22Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We generated a precise map of the Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation within the type 2 cytokine gene loci, and identified a 71-bp conserved GATA3 response element (CGRE) at 1.6-kbp upstream of the IL-13 locus exon 1. The CGRE appears to play a crucial role for GATA3-mediated targeting and downstream spreading of core histone hyperacetylation within the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci in developing Th2 cells and Tc2 cells (22Yamashita M.

Histone lysine methylation is considered to be a key epigenetic regulator (26Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 2003; 113: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Methylation of specific lysine residues of histones is required for the maintenance of large, functionally distinct chromatin domains, such as heterochromatin correlated with histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) (27Lachner M. Jenuwein T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcriptionally active euchromatin preferentially contains methylated histones at H3-K36, H3-K79, and H3-K4 sites (28Sims 3rd, R.J. Nishioka K. Reinberg D. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Particularly, methylation at H3-K4 correlates well with active or permissive state of transcription (29Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast Set1 (H3-K4 methyl-transferase) and Set2 (H3-K36 methyltransferase) induce histone lysine methylation and functionally interact with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), suggesting that histone methylation at H3-K4 and H3-K36 is a hallmark of actively transcribed chromatin (26Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Cell. 2003; 113: 429-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Some of the differentiated Th2 cells survive and are maintained as memory Th2 cells for a long period in vivo (30Swain S.L. Immunity. 1994; 1: 543-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Sprent J. Surh C.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 551-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Memory CD4 T cells can be generated from effector cells and can survive in the absence of MHC antigens (32Swain S.L. Hu H. Huston G. Science. 1999; 286: 1381-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 33Tan J.T. Ernst B. Kieper W.C. LeRoy E. Sprent J. Surh C.D. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The expression of either TCR (34Polic B. Kunkel D. Scheffold A. Rajewsky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or Src-family kinases, p56lck and p59fyn appears not to be essential for the long-term survival (35Seddon B. Zamoyska R. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also CD4 T cell survival is not directly linked to MHC-induced TCR signaling (36Dorfman J.R. Stefanova I. Yasutomo K. Germain R.N. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In class II-restricted TCR transgenic mice lacking expression of the common cytokine receptor γ-chain (γc), the survival of naïve T cells is substantially impaired but memory T cell survival is apparently normal, suggesting that γc-dependent cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15) is not required for memory CD4 T cell survival (37Lantz O. Grandjean I. Matzinger P. Di Santo J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). As for homeostatic proliferation of CD4 memory T cells, IL-7 and IL-15 are not essential (33Tan J.T. Ernst B. Kieper W.C. LeRoy E. Sprent J. Surh C.D. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to CD8 memory T cells, CD4 memory cells may not require any specific cytokine signals for their homeostatic maintenance (38Jameson S.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 39Schluns K.S. Lefrancois L. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Very recently, however, regulatory roles of IL-7 in the generation and survival of memory CD4 T cells were reported (40Kondrack R.M. Harbertson J. Tan J.T. McBreen M.E. Surh C.D. Bradley L.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 41Li J. Huston G. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1807-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition, signals through the TCR as well as the IL-7 receptor appear to regulate the homeostasis of CD4 memory T cells (42Seddon B. Tomlinson P. Zamoyska R. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Th1 memory cells appear to be generated efficiently from an IFNγ non-producing population (43Wu C.Y. Kirman J.R. Rotte M.J. Davey D.F. Perfetto S.P. Rhee E.G. Freidag B.L. Hill B.J. Douek D.C. Seder R.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still unclear whether any specific signals including those triggered by cytokines are required for the maintenance of memory Th2 cells. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance of capacity for Th2 cytokine production in memory Th2 cells, particularly those that preserve the Th2-specific remodeled chromatin are not fully understood. In the present study, we used an adoptive transfer technique for the generation of antigen-specific memory Th2 cells in vivo to investigate the molecular events governing the maintenance of their Th2-specific cytokine production. In freshly prepared in vivo generated memory Th2 cells, histones associated with the IL-4 and IL-13 gene loci were hyperacetylated (at H3-K9/14) and di- and tri-methylated (at H3-K4), and these events were seen IL-4-deficient situation as well. Intergenic transcripts accompanied by highly localized accumulation of Pol II to CNS1, IL-4 promoter, and VA enhancer sites were observed. Thus, Th2-specific remodeled chromatin of the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci is maintained in memory Th2 cells by active molecular events that are IL-4-independent. Mice—BALB/c and BALB/c nu/nu mice were purchased from Clea Inc., Tokyo, Japan. IL4-deficient mice (44Kopf M. Le Gros G. Bachmann M. Lamers M.C. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1993; 362: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar) and OVA-specific TCRαβ transgenic (DO.11.10 Tg) mice (45Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1720-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) were maintained under SPF conditions. All mice used in this study were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of Chiba University. Reagents—The reagents used in this study are as follows: Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (GK1.5-FITC), anti-CD62L mAb (MEL-14), anti-CD25 mAb (7D4), anti-CD69 mAb (H1.2F3), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb (GK1.5-PE), anti-CD44 mAb (IM7-PE), anti-CD122 mAb (TM-b1), anti-CD124 mAb (mIL-4R-M1), anti-CD127 mAb (4G3), and anti-CD132 mAb (TUGm2) were purchased from BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA. Anti-FcRgII and III mAb (2.4G2) and unconjugated anti-IL-4 mAb (11B11) were used as culture supernatants. Recombinant mouse IL-12 was purchased from BD PharMingen and recombinant mouse IL-4 was from TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan. The OVA peptide (residues 323–339; ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR) was synthesized by BEX Corporation, Tokyo, Japan. The Generation of Effector and Memory Th1/Th2 Cells—Splenic CD4 T cells from DO11.10 OVA-specific TCR transgenic (Tg) mice were stimulated with an OVA peptide (Loh15, 1 μg/ml) plus APC under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions for 5 days in vitro (10Yamashita M. Hashimoto K. Kimura M. Kubo M. Tada T. Nakayama T. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used these cells as effector Th1 or Th2 cells, respectively. The effector Th1/Th2 cells (3 × 107) were transferred intravenously into normal syngeneic BALB/c or BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice. In most of the experiments, 4 weeks after the cell transfer, KJ1+ cells in the spleen were sorted by FACSVantage™ (BD PharMingen), and used as memory Th1 and Th2 cells. Cell Cycle Analysis—Splenic KJ1+ cells were isolated by auto-MACS (Militenyi Biotec) with yielding purity >95%. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 12 h, treated with RNase for 10 min at 37 °C and then suspended in 50 μg/ml PI (propidium iodide) solution. DNA contents were analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection of Cell Division—Memory Th2 cells were prepared by sorting 4 weeks after cell transfer, and were labeled with CFSE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, Molecular Probes) as described previously (46Kimura M.

Labeled cells were stimulated with OVA peptide (0.1 or 1 μm) plus APC for 16 h, and then subjected to flow cytometry. ELISA—Cytokine production was assessed by ELISA as described (25Omori M.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Acetylation status of histone H3-K9/K4 was assessed using histone H3 (K9/14) ChIP assay kits (17-245; Upstate Biotechnology) and specific primers described in supplemental data. The ChIP assay for di- or tri-methylated histone H3-K4 was performed using anti-histone H3 di-methyl K4 antiserum (07–030; Upstate Biotechnology) and anti-histone H3 trimethyl K4 antiserum (ab7766; Abcam). The ChIP assay for GATA3, Pol II, and TFIIB was done as described (22Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol.

Generation of Antigen-specific Memory Th2 Cells in Vivo—We first established an experimental system where antigen-specific memory Th2 cells are generated and maintained efficiently in vivo. Splenic CD4 T cells from DO11.10 OVA-specific TCR transgenic (Tg) mice were stimulated with an OVA peptide (Loh15) plus APC under Th2-skewed conditions for 5 days in vitro, and then transferred intravenously into normal syngeneic BALB/c or BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice. The transferred DO11.10 Tg T cells were monitored by staining with the clonotypic KJ1 mAb. Typical staining patterns and the percentages of KJ1+ cells/CD4+ cells in BALB/c recipient mice are shown in Fig. 1A. A week after transfer, ∼25% of splenic CD4 T cells were KJ1-positive. The numbers of KJ1+ cells decreased at ∼10% at the 2 week time point, and this level was maintained for at least for 16 weeks. Similar kinetics was observed in BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice (data not shown). A typical KJ1/CD4 staining pattern of spleen cells of BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice at 4 weeks after cell transfer, and DNA contents of the recovered KJ1+ CD4+ cells are shown in Fig. 1B. The PI staining profiles of the recovered KJ1+ CD4+ cells were indistinguishable from those of freshly isolated KJ1+ cells from DO11.10 Tg mice, and almost all KJ1+ cells were in G0/G1 phase. Memory T cells proliferate rapidly in response to a low concentration of antigens as compared with naïve T cells (47Rogers P.R. Dubey C. Swain S.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2338-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In vivo generated KJ1+ memory Th2 cells in BALB/c nu/nu mice at the 4 week time point were purified by cell sorting (<98%), labeled with CFSE, and stimulated with two different doses of OVA peptides and APC for 16 h. Cell division analysis by flow cytometry showed that freshly isolated CD4 T cells from DO11.10 Tg mice did not proliferate during the first 16 h after stimulation, whereas substantial numbers of memory Th2 cells divided once in response to the antigenic peptide (27.4% for 0.1 μm and 37.9% for 1 μm OVA peptides) (Fig. 1C). Next we assessed the expression levels of cell surface molecules including activation and memory markers and cytokine receptors on the freshly isolated memory Th2 cells (Fig. 1D). The expression levels of IL-4 receptor (R)α and common γ (cγ) chains were slightly higher in memory Th2 cells compared with those of freshly isolated KJ1+ cells from DO11.10 Tg mice. Dramatically increased levels of IL-2Rβ and IL-7Rα chains were observed in memory Th2 cells. The activation markers, CD69 and CD25 (IL-2Rα chain), were not significantly expressed in either memory or naïve populations. High-level expression of CD44 was observed in all recovered KJ1-positive cells. Finally, two subpopulations with high and low expression of CD62L were observed in memory Th2 cells as well as in naïve T cells. Cytokine Production Profiles of in Vivo Generated Memory Th2 Cells—We examined the cytokine production profiles of in vivo generated memory Th2 cells recovered from BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice 4 weeks after cell transfer. Freshly isolated splenic KJ1+ CD4 T cells from DO11.10 Tg mice (Fresh), in vitro newly generated effector Th2 cells by stimulation with OVA peptides for 5 days in vitro (Effector) and in vivo generated memory Th2 cells (memory) were re-stimulated with OVA peptide plus APC for 1–3 days. As shown in Fig. 2A, in vivo generated memory Th2 cells produced large amounts of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13). The levels were significantly higher than those of effector Th2 cells particularly on day 3. CD62L expression profiles and cytokine production of the recovered KJ1+ cells were similar in both normal BALB/c and BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice (see Supplemental Fig. 1). We also prepared in vivo generated Th1 memory cells to confirm the specificity of cytokine production of memory Th1 and Th2 cells. Splenic CD4 T cells from DO11.10 Tg mice were stimulated with OVA peptide plus APC under Th1- or Th2-skewed conditions for 5 days, and transferred into recipient BALB/c nu/nu mice. Four weeks after cell transfer, KJ1+ cells were purified and re-stimulated with OVA peptide plus APC. As shown in Fig. 2B, memory Th2 cells produced large amounts of Th2 cytokines but not IFNγ, while memory Th1 cells produced large amounts of IFNγ but not Th2 cytokines. These results suggest that in vivo generated Th1 and Th2 memory cells preserved their original restricted cytokine production profiles. From these results, we decided to use KJ1+ CD4 T cells recovered from BALB/c or BALB/c nu/nu recipient mice 4 weeks after cell transfer as in vivo generated memory CD4 T cells to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control the maintenance of memory Th2 cells. Histone H3-K9/14 of the Th2 Cytokine Gene Loci Was Hyperacetylated in Memory Th2 Cells—We began with an assessment of the acetylation status of histones associated with the Th2 cytokine gene loci in freshly isolated in vivo generated memory Th2 cells. The KJ1+ memory Th2 cells were isolated by cell sorting, and the acetylation levels of histone H3 (K9/14) was determined by ChIP assay as described previously (22Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Histone H3-K9/14 associated with the IL-4 and IL-13-related gene loci (CGRE, CNS1, VA enhancer, IL-4p, and IL-13p) were hyperacetylated in both memory Th2 cells and effector Th2 cells compared with freshly isolated naïve DO11.10 TCR Tg CD4 T cells (Fig. 3A). The acetylation levels at the IL-5 promoter were significantly lower in memory Th2 cells as compared with effector Th2 cells. No hyperacetylation in the IFNγ promoter was observed. A similar hyperacetylation pattern was observed in memory Th2 cells isolated 10 weeks after cell transfer (data not shown). Next, in vivo generated memory Th1 and Th2 cells were prepared to examine the Th2-specific hyperacetylation (Fig. 3B). The levels of acetylation of the CGRE, CNS1, VA enhancer, IL-4p and IL-13p region in memory Th2 cells were significantly higher than those of memory Th1 cells. Memory Th1 cells exhibited certain levels of acetylation of these regions. The acetylation levels of IL-5 in memory Th2 cells were equivalent to those of memory Th1 cells, but they were significantly higher than those of freshly prepared CD4T cells. Equivalent levels of acetylation in RAD50 promoter were seen. For the IFNγ promoter, there was no preferential increase in acetylation in the Th1 memory cells. We compared acetylation status of IFNγ promoter in effector and memory Th1 cells and found that significant levels of acetylation of the IFNγ promoter induced in effector Th1 cells were substantially decreased in memory Th1 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest that memory Th1 and Th2 cells possess higher background levels of histone acetylation in all regions tested as compared with naïve T cells, and that Th2 memory cells preserved preferentially increased acetylation of histone H3-K9/14 in the IL-4 and IL-13 gene-related regions. These results prompted us to examine whether a unique long-range Th2-specific histone hyperacetylation within the IL-13 and IL-4 loci (22Yamashita M. Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kimura M. Omori M. Inami M. Taniguchi M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42399-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) is preserved in memory Th2 cells. We analyzed the acetylation status of histone H3 in the IL-13 and IL-4 gene loci more precisely using 29 pairs of specific primers. Fig. 3C shows the actual ChIP assay PCR bands (Upper), the summary of relative band intensity (Ac-H3/Input DNA) and the ratios of acetylation intensity of effector and memory Th2 cells to that of freshly isolated CD4 T cells. The acetylation profiles induced in effector Th2 cells were maintained in memory Th2 cells with slightly decreased levels at the regions associated with IL-13. Furthermore, the boundary of Th2-specific hyperacetylation at the CGRE site was preserved in memory Th2 cells. Histone H3 (K9/14) of the Th2 Cytokine Gene Loci Is Acetylated Equivalently in Effector and Central Memory Th2 Cells— Memory T cells can be subdivided into two distinct populations based on the expression level of CD62L (48Hengel R.L. Thaker V. Pavlick M.V. Metcalf J.A. Dennis Jr., G. Yang J. Lempicki R.A. Sereti I. Lane H.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One is the effector memory T cell (CD44high/CD62Llow) and the other is the central memory T cell (CD44high/CD62Lhigh). The change in proportion of effector and central memory Th2 cells over time was assessed in our in vivo memory Th2 cell generation system (Supplemental Fig. 3A). The ratio (effector/central memory) increased up to 4 weeks after cell transfer, and decreased thereafter. Phenotypic analysis revealed that these two memory Th2 subpopulations express similar levels of cytokine receptor components (IL-4Rα, Cγ, IL-2Rβ, and IL-7Rα) (Supplemental Fig. 3B). Both populations produced substantial amounts of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 with marginal production of IFNγ. The levels of IL-4 production were slightly but reproducibly higher in central memory Th2 cells, and those of IL-5 were higher in effector memory Th2 cells. The production of IL-13 was equivalent between these two subpopulations (Supplemental Fig. 3C, lower left panel). Concurrently, we assessed the acetylation status of histone H3 (K9/14), and substantial and equivalent histone hyperacetylation of the IL-4 and IL-13-related regions were detected in these two subpopulations (Supplemental Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained in effector and central memory Th2 cells 10 weeks after cell transfer (data not shown). These results would indicate that Th2-specific remodeled chromatin is preserved in both effector and central memory Th2 cells. IL-4 Is Not Required for the Generation and the Maintenance of Memory Th2 Cells—IL-4 is a critical cytokine for the induction of chromatin remodeling of the Th2 cytokine gene loci during Th2 cell development. Consequently, we examined the requirement of IL-4 for the generation and the maintenance of memory Th2 cells. Splenic CD4 T cells from IL-4-deficient DO11.10 Tg mice with a BALB/c background were stimulated with OVA peptide and APC in the presence of exogenous IL-4 for 5 days. The effector Th2 cells from IL-4-deficient mice produced almost the same amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 compared with those from normal mice, and the acetylation status of the Th2 cytokine gene loci was almost equivalent (data not shown). Then, the cultured cells were transferred into recipient normal BALB/c mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, the numbers of KJ1+CD4 T cells and the ratio of effector/central memory cells were similar between wild type (WT), IL-4+/– heterozygous (Hetero), and I"

Malaria remains one of the most important infectious diseases, causing an estimated 300–500 million clinical cases and 1–3 million deaths annually (1Organization World Health WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: 1-74Google Scholar). The current situation is largely due to the spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains and a lack of alternative drugs that can replace chloroquine as a first-line antimalarial drug. Chloroquine is believed to exert its antimalarial activity by interfering with endogenous heme detoxification pathways (2Ginsburg H. Ward S.A. Bray P.G. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 357-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During intraerythrocytic development, P. falciparum degrades the host cell hemoglobin in its acidic food vacuole, releasing large quantities of heme, which are detoxified, presumably through peroxidative degradation (3Loria P.

Cell. 2000; 6: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). BLAST analysis has revealed no obvious homologies of PfCRT to proteins of known function. However, one study has reported a vague structural resemblance of PfCRT to aqueous chloride channels (28Warhurst D.C. Craig J.C. Adagu I.S. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1527-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas another study has suggested that PfCRT belongs to the drug/metabolite transporter family (29Tran C.V. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus far, only one study has attempted to investigate the function of PfCRT. Heterologous expression of PfCRT fusion proteins in Pichia pastoris and the subsequent investigation of transport properties displayed by inside-out membrane vesicles suggested a function for PfCRT in passive transmembrane Cl– movement (30Zhang H. Howard E.M. Roepe P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49767-49775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear from these data whether PfCRT itself mediates Cl– movement, e.g. by functioning as a chloride channel, or whether the observed effects are of a secondary nature due to the activation of endogenous channels. Thus, there is very little information available regarding the biological function of PfCRT during parasite development or regarding its role as a mediator of chloroquine resistance. A better understanding of the properties of PfCRT would be an important step toward novel intervention strategies, which may either circumvent the chloroquine resistance mechanism or inactivate it, thereby revitalizing chloroquine as a first-line drug. In search of an alternative, more amenable heterologous expression system to study the function of PfCRT, we have expressed, in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the wild-type pfcrt allele from the chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum clone HB3. Successful membrane expression of the protein was associated with changes in oocyte properties. Compared with control cells, PfCRT-expressing oocytes exhibited a more alkaline intracellular pH and a less negative transmembrane potential difference. The alkaline intracellular pH reverted to control values in the presence of Na+-H+ exchanger inhibitors. The membrane potential hyperpolarized upon removal of extracellular Na+ or in the presence of diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid. We conclude from our data that PfCRT expression activates the endogenous Na+-H+ antiporter and an endogenous nonselective cation conductance, both present in the plasma membrane of X. laevis oocytes. Chemicals—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except Hoechst 694 ((3-methyl-sulfonyl-4-piperidinobenzoyl)guanidine methanesulfonate), which was a gift from Dr. H. J. Lang (Aventis). Biological Material—X. laevis adult females were purchased from CNRS (Montpellier, France) and NASCO and kept as described (31Cougnon M. Benammou S. Brouillard F. Hulin P. Planelles G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1445-C1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Anesthesia was administered by immersion in iced water supplemented with 2 mm ethyl n-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate. Ovarian fragments were incubated in collagenase A-containing Ringer's solution as described previously (32Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After rinsing, stage V–VI oocytes were defolliculated using fine forceps. Expression of pfcrt cRNA in X. laevis Oocytes—To obtain PfCRT expression in X. laevis oocytes, the pfcrt allele of the chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum clone HB3 was reconstructed on the basis of the yeast codon usage (Geneart, Regensburg, Germany). The resulting fragment was cloned into the BglII site of the X. laevis oocyte expression vector pSP64T (33Gould G.W. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9447-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The construct was designed such that the authentic protein was produced in X. laevis oocytes without any additional amino acids. The cRNA of PfCRT was prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion Inc.). cRNA was dissolved in RNase-free water, stored at –80 °C, and diluted to a concentration of 400 ng/μl immediately prior to injection. 50 nl (containing 20 ng of cRNA or water for the controls) were injected into defolliculated stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes using a Nanoject automatic injector (Drummond Science Inc., Broomall, PA). Immunodetection of PfCRT—2–3 days after cRNA injection into oocytes, membranes were prepared from X. laevis oocytes (35Kathofer S. Zhang W. Karle C. Thomas D. Schoels W. Kiehn J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26743-26747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Membrane proteins were size-fractionated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. PfCRT was detected using a guinea pig anti-peptide antiserum (1:1000 dilution) raised against the N terminus of PfCRT (MKF ASK KNN QKN SSK; Eurogentec). As a secondary antibody, we used a peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig antiserum (1:10,000 dilution) purchased from Dianova. Immunofluorescence—2 days after cRNA injection, oocytes were embedded in Tissue-Tek cryo-embedding compound (Miles Inc.); frozen in liquid propane; which was cooled by liquid nitrogen; and stored at –80 °C until used. Sections (5 μm) were cut at –26 °C with a cryomicrotome and mounted on glass slides. For immunofluorescence staining, sections were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PfCRT was detected using the guinea pig anti-PfCRT antiserum. As a secondary antibody, a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig antiserum (1:100 dilution; Dianova) was used. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Electrophysiological Approaches—For electrophysiological experiments, oocytes were placed in a Plexiglas microchamber and superfused by the gravimetric delivery of artificial solutions, differing from each other by a single parameter. The membrane potential (Vm) and the intracellular pH (pHi), intracellular Na+ activity (αNa), or intracellular Cl– activity (αCl) were simultaneously measured using double-barreled ion-selective microelectrodes. The details of microelectrode manufacture have been described previously (32Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 393: 73-89Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, the tip of the pH-sensitive barrel was filled with Fluka H+ ionophore 95291 and its shank with 67 mm NaCl, 40 mm KH2PO4, and 23 mm NaOH. Na+- and Cl–-selective electrodes were filled with Fluka 71176 and Corning 477913, respectively, and the shank was backfilled with 100 mm NaCl. The conventional barrel contained 1 m KCl. When necessary, the double-barreled microelectrode was gently beveled prior to use on a microgrinder (de Marco Eng., Geneva, Switzerland). Double-barreled microelectrodes were placed on a three-dimensional micromanipulator (MM 33, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and connected via Ag/AgCl electrodes to the input of an ultrahigh impedance electrometer (WPI FD 223, Aston, United Kingdom). Before each experiment, the slope of the selective microelectrode was determined from the change in potential induced by a change in Cl– or Na+ concentration or in pH value of the superfusing solution. The slope was systematically checked again at the end of each experiment. The slope was 55–62 mV/pH unit for pH-sensitive microelectrodes, 50–59 mV/concentration decade change for Na+-sensitive microelectrodes, and 49–54 mV/concentration decade change for Cl–-sensitive microelectrodes. We verified that the slope was not affected by the different solutions used in this study. Upon impalement of an oocyte, the conventional barrel of the microelectrode measured the Vm, and the selective barrel measured the electrochemical potential of the ion under investigation (Vsel) across the cell membrane. The electrometer output displayed on a multichart recorder (Sefram, Servofram, Saint Etienne, France) gave both the Vm signal and the algebraic sum of Vsel – Vm. The intracellular ionic activity of the ion i (Ai) was calculated using the following general relationship: Ai = Aref × 10(Vsel – Vm)/S, where Aref is the ionic activity for i in the reference solution (using an activity coefficient of 0.75) and S is the slope. For experiments with pH-sensitive microelectrodes, this general equation reduces to the simplified relationship pHi = pHref – (VH – Vm)/S, where pHref is the pH of the Ringer's solution, and VH is the proton electrochemical potential across the cell membrane. In experiments in which only Vm was needed, conventional microelectrodes filled with 1 or 3 m KCl were used. Preliminary experiments showed that the measured Vm was similar when using 1 or 3 m KCl to backfill conventional microelectrodes. The electrical circuit was closed by a KCl (1 or 3 m)-agarose Ag/AgCl macroelectrode placed in the bath. To obtain oocyte-specific membrane conductances (Gm) and current-voltage relationships, cells were punctured with two separate microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl (resistance of <5 megaohms). Experiments were controlled using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) (37Friedrich O. Ehmer T. Fink R.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 757-770Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Friedrich O. Ehmer T. Uttenweiler D. Vogel M. Barry P.H. Fink R.H. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2046-2055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To avoid bath error potentials induced by superfusate changes, the bath potential was virtually clamped to 0 mV using a two-electrode virtual ground circuit (37Friedrich O. Ehmer T. Fink R.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 757-770Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Electrode tip potentials were adjusted to 0 mV in the bulk solution prior to penetration of the oocytes. Membrane capacitance was compensated for by ∼90% using the capacitance compensation circuit of the amplifier. To account for resistance errors due to electrode tip polarizations, the tip potential was measured at the end of an experiment after electrode withdrawal from the oocyte, and experiments during which the tip potentials varied by >2 mV were discarded. The Gm was obtained from current clamp experiments as follows. The Vm was set to –70 mV by injection of a constant current from which current pulse steps ranging from –10 to +30 nA in 10-nA increments were applied for 8–10 s, and the change in Vm was recorded. The input conductance was calculated from the slope of the linear steady-state Vm-current relationship. Gm was determined by relating the input conductance to the membrane surface of the oocytes, calculated after optical measurement of the oocyte diameter. For voltage clamp recordings, the holding potential was adjusted to –70 mV, and potential step pulses lasting for 15 s were applied from –120 to +20 mV in 20-mV increments while the membrane current (Im) was recorded. The current-voltage relationship was determined from the steady-state Im values. Artificial Solutions—Prior to the experiments, oocytes were kept at 18 °C in an amphibian-adapted Ringer's solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were performed at room temperature. In Na+-free solutions, NaCl was replaced with an equimolar amount of choline chloride or lithium chloride, and the pH was adjusted using Trizma (Tris base). In the Cl–-free solutions, chloride salts were replaced with gluconate salts, and the calcium concentration was raised 3-fold to compensate for calcium chelation by gluconate–. When using CO2/HCO3−-buffered Ringer's solution, a 21 mm concentration of the bulk of NaCl was replaced with an equimolar concentration of NaHCO3−, and the solution was equilibrated with CO2 at a pressure of 3 kilopascals to pH 7.5. In ammonium-containing solutions, 20 mm NH4Cl were used at the expense of NaCl. In cell acid loading experiments, a 40 mm sodium salicylate-containing solution (NaCl was reduced by an equivalent amount) was used. Where indicated, the Ringer's solution was supplemented with diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DPC 1The abbreviations used are: DPC, diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid; EIPA, ethylisopropylamiloride; NHE, Na+-H+ exchanger. ; 1 mm), ouabain (0.1 mm), amiloride (1 or 0.1 mm), Hoechst 694 (50 μm), or ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA; 50 μm). Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.E., with n = number of oocytes investigated from at least three independent experiments. Significance of the results was assessed by paired or unpaired Student's t test, and results were considered significantly different for p < 0.05. Expression of PfCRT in X. laevis Oocytes—Translation of pfcrt cRNA in Xenopus oocytes was verified by Western analysis using a guinea pig antiserum specific to PfCRT, which identified a protein with the expected size of 48.6 kDa (Fig. 1a). The bulk of PfCRT was found associated with the total membrane fraction (Fig. 1a). Immunofluorescence revealed co-localization of PfCRT over the oolemma. In addition, a dotted staining pattern was observed within the yolk (Fig. 1b). PfCRT Expression Alters Oocyte pHi and Vm—To determine whether PfCRT expression modifies basic properties of the oocytes, we measured the resting Vm, pHi, αNa, and αCl 2 days after cRNA injection. Water-injected oocytes were measured in parallel as controls. Compared with control oocytes, for which measured values were consistent with published data (32Cougnon M. Bouyer P. Hulin P. Anagnostopoulos T. Planelles G. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Burckhardt B.C. Kroll B. Fromter E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 420: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), PfCRT-expressing oocytes exhibited a higher pHi and a lower Vm (Table I). αNa and αCl were similar in control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes (Table I). Using a CO2/HCO3−-instead of a HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution had no effect on the Vm values (data not shown), yet slightly reduced pHi while maintaining the pHi differences observed between PfCRT-expressing and control oocytes (Table I). This finding suggests that the effects of pfcrt expression on the oocyte Vm and pHi are HCO3−-independent. For this reason, we performed further investigations in a nominal CO2/HCO3−-free buffer.Table IVm, pHi, amiloride-sensitive pHi recovery rate from an acid load (ΔpHi/Δt), αNa, and αCl of control and PfCRT-expressing oocytesVmpHiαNaαClΔpHi/ΔtmVmmmmpH units/minControl-46.47 ± 0.49 (103)7.42 ± 0.02 (29)5.58 ± 0.25 (6)26.31 ± 0.35 (7)0.0024 ± 0.0015 (3)PfCRT-22.04 ± 0.24 (129)aSignificant differences in the respective parameter (p < 0.001) between control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes.7.68 ± 0.01 (37)aSignificant differences in the respective parameter (p < 0.001) between control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes.5.76 ± 0.23 (7; NS)25.04 ± 0.59 (7; NS)0.0127 ± 0.0018 (3)aSignificant differences in the respective parameter (p < 0.001) between control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes.a Significant differences in the respective parameter (p < 0.001) between control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes. Open table in a new tab To better define the temporal changes in Vm and pHi, we measured both parameters every 6 h following the injection of the pfcrt cRNA. Both the Vm and pHi began to diverge from the control values, determined in mock-transfected oocytes, ∼16 h after cRNA injection and approached steady-state values after 42 h (Fig. 2, a and b). Subsequent experiments were performed 46–72 h after cRNA (or water) injection. PfCRT Expression Enhances Proton-equivalent Extrusion—We next sought to investigate the cause of the higher resting pHi observed in PfCRT-expressing oocytes compared with control oocytes. Previous studies have shown that the main pHi regulatory mechanism in oocytes is Na+-H+ exchange (39Burckhardt B.C. Kroll B. Fromter E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 420: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that altered Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE) activity may be responsible for the higher pHi observed in PfCRT-expressing oocytes. To verify this hypothesis, we incubated oocytes in the presence of amiloride (1 and 0.1 mm), Hoechst 694 (50 μm), and EIPA (50 μm). These compounds are established inhibitors of NHEs (40Masereel B. Pochet L. Laeckmann D. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 38: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), including that of X. laevis oocytes (39Burckhardt B.C. Kroll B. Fromter E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 420: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 41Busch S. Rosskopf D. Lang H.J. Weichert A. Siffert W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although no immediate changes in pHi were observed, incubations for 4 h in the presence of NHE inhibitors affected the pHi in both control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3a). However, the observed intracellular acidification was significantly stronger in PfCRT-expressing oocytes, with pHi values now approaching those of control oocytes (Fig. 3a). Incubating oocytes in the presence of amiloride or other NHE inhibitors for 4 h did not alter the Vm in either control or PfCRT-expressing oocytes (data not shown). These data are consistent with amiloride and the other compounds inhibiting an electroneutral H+ extrusion system, viz. NHE. To verify the conclusion that PfCRT-expressing oocytes have an activated NHE, we determined the rate of pHi recovery after an acid load, brought about by superfusing the oocytes in a salicylate-containing solution. Exposure to the salicylate-containing solution acidified the cells to similar pHi values (7.03 ± 0.03 (n = 6) and 6.97 ± 0.02 (n = 6) for PfCRT-expressing and control oocytes, respectively). Upon salicylate withdrawal, the pHi recovery rates were then determined in the presence and absence of amiloride in a paired fashion. As shown in Fig. 3b, in the absence of amiloride, recovery of the pHi to its resting value was faster in PfCRT-expressing oocytes than in control oocytes. The amiloride-sensitive component of the pHi recovery rates was (1.27 ± 0.2) × 10–2 pH units/min (n = 3) for PfCRT-expressing oocytes and (0.24 ± 0.15) × 10–2 pH units/min (n = 3) for control oocytes (p < 0.001) (Table I). The results suggest that, in PfCRT-expressing oocytes, the alkaline resting pHi is due to an increase in H+ extrusion mediated by an amiloride-sensitive NHE. Moreover, the high resting pHi is apparently not directly related to the low Vm in PfCRT-expressing oocytes. PfCRT Expression Activates a Nonselective Cation Conductance—To investigate the low Vm values observed in PfCRT-expressing oocytes, we first determined the Gm in control and PfCRT-expressing oocytes. From an initial holding Vm of –70 mV, step currents of –10, +10, +20, and +30 nA were applied to the oocytes, and temporal changes in Vm were monitored (Fig. 4a). A significantly higher Gm value of 48.10 ± 6.7 microsiemens/cm2 (n = 24) was observed in PfCRT-expressing oocytes compared with control oocytes, which had a Gm of 15.09 ± 0.97 microsiemens/cm2 (n = 23; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4b). Removing Na+ (substituted with an equimolar amount of choline+) or Cl– (substituted with an equimolar amount of gluconate–) from the bath had virtually no effect on the Gm in control oocytes, but substantially reduced the Gm in PfCRT-expressing oocytes (Fig. 4b). To further characterize the enhanced Gm observed in PfCRT-expressing oocytes, current-voltage relationships were established over a range from –120 to +20 mV. Fig. 5a shows representative recordings of membrane currents of oocytes bathed in Ringer's solution. Consistent with measured steady-state Vm values (zero current), the current-voltage relationship of PfCRT-expressing oocytes was shifted by about +20 mV compared with that of control cells (Fig. 5b). Moreover, a slowly activating inward rectification was observed at negative voltage (Fig. 5b). Cl– removal had little effect on the current-voltage relationships of control oocytes (Fig. 5b). In PfCRT-expressing oocytes, however, Cl– removal considerably reduced the inward rectification observed at negative voltage without significantly affecting the potential at which currents inverted polarity (Erev). In comparison, Na+ removal shifted the Erev to a more negative value (from –19.99 ± 0.83 to –34.23 ± 1.86 mV) (Fig. 5c). In the range of Erev (–40 to –20 mV), Na+ removal also induced a reduction in Gm (from 36.04 ± 2.87 microsiemens/cm2 (n = 40) to 23.12 ± 2.73 microsiemens/cm2 (n = 11; p < 0.01)) in PfCRT-expressing oocytes as determined from the current-voltage relationships (Fig. 5c). At Vm values more negative than –40 mV, the reduction in Gm was even more pronounced, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4. Na+ removal had no significant effect on control oocytes (Fig. 5c). These findings suggest that, in PfCRT-expressing oocytes, the low resting Vm is associated with an increased Gm and a change in ion selectivity of the membrane, which, in turn, is consistent with the activation of a cation conductance(s). To determine the nature of this conductance, the effects of extracellular ion substitutions on the Vm were monitored. Consistent with results from the previous protocol (zero current conditions), changing the superfusate from Ringer's s"
https://openalex.org/W2001658200,"Iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP-1) is a bifunctional [4Fe-4S] protein that functions as a cytosolic aconitase or as a trans-regulatory factor controlling iron homeostasis at a post-transcriptional level. Because IRP-1 is a sensitive target protein for nitric oxide (NO), we investigated whether this protein is nitrated in inflammatory macrophages and whether this post-transcriptional modification changes its activities. RAW 264.7 macrophages were first stimulated with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide (IFN-γ/LPS) and then triggered by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in order to promote co-generation of NO. and O2·¯. IRP-1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed for protein-bound nitrotyrosine by Western blotting. We show that nitration of endogenous IRP-1 in NO-producing macrophages boosted to produce O2·¯ was accompanied by aconitase inhibition and impairment of its capacity to bind the iron-responsive element (IRE) of ferritin mRNA. Lost IRE-binding activity was not recovered by exposure of IRP-1 to 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and was not due to protein degradation. Inclusion of cis-aconitate with cell extract to stabilize the [4Fe-4S] cluster of holo-IRP-1 rendered protein insensitive to nitration by peroxynitrite, suggesting that loss of [Fe-S] cluster and subsequent change of conformation are prerequisites for tyrosine nitration. IRP-1 nitration was strongly reduced when IFN-γ/LPS/PMA-stimulated cells were incubated with myeloperoxidase inhibitors, which points to the contribution of the nitrite/H2O2/peroxidase pathway to IRP-1 nitration in vivo. Interestingly, under these conditions, IRP-1 recovered full IRE binding as assessed by treatment with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Peroxidase-mediated nitration of critical tyrosine residues, by holding IRP-1 in an inactive state, may constitute, in activated macrophages, a self-protecting mechanism against iron-induced toxicity.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 627-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). They operate by interacting with one or several specific stem-loop RNA structures called iron-responsive elements (IREs), which are located in untranslated regions (UTR) of several mRNAs. At low intracellular iron concentration, IRPs bind to the IRE of ferritin mRNA at its 5′-UTR and block translation, whereas they stabilize transferrin receptor mRNA through direct interactions with several IRE motifs in the 3′-UTR. One critical discrepancy between the two IRPs is that only IRP-1 functions as a cytosolic aconitase when holding a [4Fe-4S] cluster, which masks the IRE-binding domain. In this case, holo-IRP-1 catalyzes the interconversion of citrate into isocitrate via the intermediate formation of cis-aconitate, as does its mitochondrial counterpart in the Krebs cycle (2Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It is well documented that nitric oxide (NO.) also stimulates the trans-regulatory activity of IRP-1 and consequently disturbs iron homeostasis in various cellular systems exposed to inflammatory conditions (3Bouton C. Drapier J.C. Science's STKE. 2003; (182): pe17PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, NO. converts IRP-1 from an aconitase to a trans-regulatory factor by directly targeting its [Fe-S] cluster leading to its complete disassembly (4Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 5Cairo G. Ronchi R. Recalcati S. Campanella A. Minotti G.

In this way, the apoprotein generated by NO., in a reducing environment, tightly binds to IRE(s) and exerts its iron-regulatory function (7Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 8Oliveira L. Bouton C. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 516-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the early 1990s, it was reported that simultaneous production of NO. and superoxide ( O2·¯) by activated macrophages led to intracellular formation of peroxynitrite (9Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Since NO. can turn into a powerful oxidizing and nitrating agent such as peroxynitrite in vivo, its reactivity toward key enzymes of cellular metabolism has become an active area of investigation (10Greenacre S.A. Ischiropoulos H. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 34: 541-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 11Alvarez B. Radi R. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 295-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Regarding IRP-1, in vitro studies have demonstrated that peroxynitrite causes the direct inhibition of its aconitase activity by promoting complete disruption of the [4Fe-4S] cluster but, unlike NO., without stimulating the IRE-binding activity of IRP-1 (5Cairo G. Ronchi R. Recalcati S. Campanella A. Minotti G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7435-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 6Soum E. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Inorg.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These data suggest that peroxynitrite might generate additional posttranslational modifications of IRP-1 in comparison with NO.. Interestingly, recent biochemical and resonance Raman studies have allowed the detection of tyrosine nitration on pure recombinant IRP-1 by synthetic peroxynitrite or by SIN-1, an NO·/O2·¯ donor (6Soum E. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Soum E. Brazzolotto X. Goussias C. Bouton C. Moulis J.M. Mattioli T.A. Drapier J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7648-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, in vivo studies of IRP-1 nitration have never been undertaken. Currently, the physiological mechanism of protein nitration in vivo is much debated, and whether peroxynitrite is really the reactive precursor of nitrating species in biological systems has been questioned. Indeed, alternative mechanisms, such as the one mediated by the nitrite/H2O2/myeloperoxidase pathway, have now been identified, particularly in activated neutrophils and certain macrophages (14Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 15Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34051-34058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we have therefore explored whether nitration of IRP-1 could occur in a whole-cell (physiological) context. To address this issue, we used the murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and favored the generation of endogenous nitrating species by stimulating them with inflammatory and/or pharmacological stimuli, thus seeking IRP-1 tyrosine nitration. We then investigated the biological significance of this endogenous nitration by measuring both IRP-1 functions in parallel, in the presence or absence of cis-aconitate, a substrate that protects the holo-form of IRP-1. Finally, we also attempted to identify the nitrating pathway that mediates IRP-1 nitration in activated macrophages. Products—Murine recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ; specific activity, 2 × 107 units/mg) was provided by R&D Systems. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, serotype 0111:B4), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA), p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide (pHBAH), epicatechin, and cis-aconitate were from Sigma. Selenomethionine was from Calbiochem (VWR International). l-Monomethy-l-arginine (l-NMA) and S-ethylisothiourea (EIT) were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Peroxynitrite was synthesized according to the method of Uppu and Pryor (16Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and concentrated by freezing. Residual hydrogen peroxide in the final solution was removed by treating peroxynitrite solution over solid granular manganese dioxide (WWR International). Cell Culture and Treatment—The macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line was cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells (5 × 106) were treated with 20 units/ml IFN-γ and 50 ng/ml LPS for 18 h to induce endogenous NO. production. To stimulate the production of O2·¯ in the presence of NO., a second stimulation by 50 nm PMA was applied to IFN-γ/LPS-(pre)-stimulated cells for additional times as indicated in each figure. To analyze the signaling pathway of nitrating species, cells were also treated with IFN-γ/LPS or IFN-γ/LPS/PMA as described above, in the presence of NO synthase inhibitors (1 mm l-NMA, 100 μm EIT), peroxynitrite scavengers (100 μm epicatechin, 30 μm selenomethionine), or myeloperoxidase inhibitors (50 μm ABAH, 50 μm SHA, 50 μm pHBAH). Nitrite Measurement—The nitrite content in cell culture supernates was determined using the Griess reagent containing 0.5% sulfanilamide and 0.05% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine hydrochloride in 45% acetic acid. Nitrite reacts with Griess color reagent to give a red-violet diazo-dye, which is measured spectrophotometrically at 543 nm; nitrite concentration is calculated from a sodium nitrite standard curve. Cytoplasmic Extracts—After each treatment, cells were harvested in 250 μl of 0.25 m sucrose with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then treated with 0.007% digitonin on ice. After 10 min, cell lysate was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction (supernatant) was tested for protein concentration, and aconitase activity was measured before storage at -80 °C. In Vitro Treatment with a Bolus of Peroxynitrite—Cytosols (100 μg) of control cells were treated with increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite added as a bolus in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm sodium bicarbonate to favor formation of the nitrosoperoxocarboxylate intermediate, which causes more nitration and less sulfhydryl oxidation (17Kuhn D.M. Geddes T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29726-29732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cytosols were pretreated with increasing concentrations of cis-aconitate prior to incubation with a bolus of peroxynitrite. Concentration of peroxynitrite stock solution was determined at 302 nm (ϵ = 1670 m-1 × cm-1) in 0.1 m NaOH solution before use. The pH of each reaction mixture was carefully checked after peroxynitrite addition and was maintained at 7.5 in all experiments. Aconitase Activity—Aconitase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by following the disappearance of the cis-aconitate at 240 nm (18Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty micrograms of cytosolic extracts was preheated at 37 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 before starting the enzymatic reaction with 0.3 mmcis-aconitate. Units correspond to nmol of substrate consumed/min, and ϵ240 nm = 3.6 mm-1 × cm-1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—IRP-1/IRE interactions were visualized as described previously (19Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of protein was incubated with an excess of 32P-labeled H-chain ferritin IRE in 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol (buffer A). In parallel experiments, samples were treated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) before the labeled RNA probe was added. This treatment allows full expression of IRP-1 IRE-binding activity. After 15 min at room temperature, 1 unit of RNase T1 was added. After 10 min, 5 mg/ml heparin was added for an equivalent additional time. IRP-1·IRE complexes were resolved in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive bands were quantified with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cytosolic extracts from control and treated cells were immunoprecipitated using colloidal superparamagnetic microbeads of protein A (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish Gladbach, Germany). One μl of rat liver IRP-1 antiserum (kindly provided by Dr R. S. Eisenstein) was added to 200 μl of cytosolic extract (0.5 mg/ml) in 700 μl of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and mixed. Then, 100 μl of protein A-microbeads was added to the suspension to magnetically label the immune complex. After 2 h on ice and in the dark, the magnetically labeled immune complex was bound to a column placed in a magnetic field, and after several washings the immunoprecipitated IRP-1 was eluted from the column with 50 μl1× SDS gel loading buffer. Fifteen μl of the eluate was resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked in 3% milk, phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature with constant agitation and then incubated with polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (diluted 1:5000; Cayman Chemical) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After several washings, the blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako, Trappes, France) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay for 3-Nitrotyrosine—Recombinant purified human IRP-1 was incubated with 5 mmcis-aconitate for 10 min at room temperature before adding 500 μm SIN-1 for an additional 30 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6. No pH variation was detected at any time during incubation. 3-Nitrotyrosine-modified IRP-1 was quantified in 96-well plates using 0.5 μg IRP-1. Hybridization was carried out with the mouse monoclonal nitrotyrosine antibody (Cayman Chemical) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by several washings with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Sequential incubations were then performed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG (1:2000) for 1 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm after color development was initiated by substrate addition. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy and Spin Trapping—RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated or not with 20 units/ml IFN-γ and 50 ng/ml LPS for 18, 20, and 24 h. Spin-trapping measurements of NO. were performed with 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the Fe2+ complex of N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (1:5). EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature and at 77 K using a Varian E 109 spectrometer (microwave frequency 9.32 GHz, modulation amplitude 5 gauss, and time constant 0.5 s). The magnetic field was calibrated with the stable radical 1-1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl used as a marker with g value = 2.0036. Tyrosine Nitration of Cytosolic IRP-1 by Peroxynitrite—Our previous work concerning the mechanism of action of peroxynitrite on IRP-1 has shown that the molsidomine metabolite SIN-1, which spontaneously decomposes to yield both NO. and O2·¯ concomitantly, thus forming a steady flux of peroxynitrite, was able to nitrate pure recombinant human IRP-1 in vitro (6Soum E. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address whether cellular endogenous IRP-1 might also be nitrated in response to nitrogen-derived species, we first exposed the cytosolic fraction of resting RAW 264.7 macrophages to increasing concentrations of synthetic peroxynitrite. IRP-1 was then immunoprecipitated from cytosols, and tyrosine nitration on IRP-1 was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal nitrotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 1, IRP-1 from untreated cytosol exhibited high aconitase activity (50 units/mg defined as 100% activity in this assay) and nonsignificant nitration. In contrast, the addition of peroxynitrite to resting cell cytosol led to IRP-1 nitration, which was rapidly detectable in the low micromolar range (Fig. 1, B and C). It is noteworthy that the appearance of nitration after a short exposure of 10 μm peroxynitrite was accompanied by a significant decrease in cytosolic aconitase activity (76% of the control value) (Fig. 1A). Increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite, from 25 to 500 μm, progressively rendered IRP-1 nitration more intense and cytosolic aconitase less active (Fig. 1, A and B). In parallel, we also observed that IRP-1 IRE-binding activity in cytosols treated with peroxynitrite was not stimulated (data not shown). Endogenous Nitration of IRP-1 in IFN-γ/LPS- and IFN-γ/LPS/PMA-activated Macrophages—To address the question of whether endogenous IRP-1 might be nitrated in a whole-cell physiological context, murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated with IFN-γ and LPS for 18 h to stimulate NO. production through NO synthase-2 induction (Fig. 2A). Then, activated cells were further incubated with or without 50 nm PMA for an additional 3 or 6 h to stimulate O2·¯ production (20Curnutte J.T. Erickson R.W. Ding J. Badwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10813-10819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We checked that during this time frame nitrite accumulated linearly in the cell culture medium (65, 80, and 95 μm at times 0, 3, and 6 h after PMA addition, respectively) and that stimulated cells produced NO. using an EPR spin-trapping assay (data not shown). We then harvested the cells and extracted their cytosols. IRP-1 was isolated from cytosols by immunoprecipitation, and its nitration was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal nitrotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, constitutively expressed IRP-1 was not nitrated in intact resting macrophages, whereas its cytosolic aconitase activity was high and nitrite production was insignificant. However, after 24 h of IFN-γ/LPS stimulation, the protein exhibited tyrosine nitration. Interestingly, the intensity of IRP-1 nitration increased further in a time-dependent manner when IFN-γ/LPS-treated macrophages were co-stimulated with PMA. Our data also showed that IRP-1 nitration in activated macrophages was accompanied by complete inhibition of cytosolic aconitase activity of IRP-1 (Fig. 2B). In another set of experiments, we investigated the direct involvement of the NO-signaling pathway in endogenous nitration of IRP-1. RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated for 24 h with IFN-γ/LPS or IFN-γ/LPS/PMA, as described in Fig. 2, in the presence of l-NMA and EIT, two inhibitors of inducible NO synthase. We showed in Fig. 3 (A and B) that the l-NMA/EIT combination prevented both nitrite production and inhibition of aconitase activity in stimulated cells. Importantly, these two events were correlated with a significant decline in IRP-1 tyrosine nitration (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 2 and 3). We also noticed that treatment of PMA alone triggers neither nitration of IRP-1 nor inhibition of cytosolic aconitase activity.Fig. 3Effects of NO synthase inhibitors on IRP-1 tyrosine nitration by IFN-γ/LPS- and IFN-γ/LPS/PMA-activated macrophages. Cells were stimulated for 18 h with 20 units/ml IFN-γ plus 50 ng/ml LPS. Then, cells were incubated for an additional 6 h with or without 50 nm PMA. In parallel, stimulated cells were also exposed to NO synthase inhibitors (1 mm l-NMA plus 100 μm EIT) throughout the incubation. A, nitrite production was determined in the cell culture medium. B, cytosols were then extracted and used to measure aconitase activity. C, in parallel, cytosols were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRP-1 antibody, and the resulting samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using a specific anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. The experiments were performed at least three times, and a representative result is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inhibition of IRP-1 Activities after Optimal Tyrosine Nitration—To investigate further the relationship between IRP-1 nitration and its functions, in parallel experiments we measured IRP-1 IRE-binding activity in control and activated macrophages. As expected from earlier studies, binding of IRP-1 to the IRE of ferritin mRNA was stimulated in IFN-γ/LPS-treated macrophages (Fig. 4A). However, when PMA was added along with IFN-γ/LPS, IRP-1 was far less potent in binding IRE (Fig. 4A, upper panel, compare lane 2 with lane 3). Remarkably, this impairment of IRP-1 in binding the IRE motif correlated with the strongest IRP-1 nitration (compare Fig. 3C with Fig. 4A). We also performed the binding assay in the presence of 2% 2-ME prior the IRE probe addition (Fig. 4A, lower panel). It is well known that this treatment allows full expression of IRP-1 IRE-binding activity (21Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the IRP-1 of control cells was totally converted into its IRE-binding form (Fig. 4A, lower panel, lane 1). As previously shown, full IRP-1 IRE-binding capacity of IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells measured in the presence of 2% 2-ME was half that of control (Fig. 4A, lower panel, compare lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. 4B). This was previously explained by a 50% decrease in IRP-1 protein level in response to NO. (22Oliveira L. Drapier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6550-6555Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and illustrated here in Fig. 4C (compare lanes 1 and 2). Remarkably, when IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells were co-incubated with PMA, the full IRE-binding activity of IRP-1 (in the presence of 2% 2-ME) was further reduced (Fig. 4A, lower panel, compare lanes 1, 2, and 3, and Fig. 4B) to a residual value of 30% of control. This 2-ME-resistant reduction of IRP-1 IRE-binding activity was not due to IRP-1 protein loss, because IRP-1 level was not further reduced during co-stimulation of IFN-γ/LPS-treated cells with PMA (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2 and 3). These results show that PMA-induced loss of IRE-binding capacity of IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated cells results from a post-translational modification of IRP-1. We then asked whether IRP-1 nitration precedes or follows [Fe-S] cluster disruption. To solve this issue, we preincubated the cytosols of untreated cells with increasing concentrations of cis-aconitate before adding 25 μm peroxynitrite, a concentration that significantly enhanced nitration of IRP-1 in vitro and considerably reduced aconitase activity (Fig. 1). In this set of experiments, we used cis-aconitate because this aconitase substrate is known to protect IRP-1 through stabilization of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of IRP-1 (12Bouton C. Hirling H. Drapier J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19969-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2735-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After cis-aconitate/peroxynitrite treatment, aconitase activity was determined in cytosols, and nitration of IRP-1 was sought after immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, untreated cytosols exhibited high aconitase activity of IRP-1 and no significant IRP-1 nitration. As expected, peroxynitrite alone led to a 93% inhibition of aconitase activity, which was accompanied by pronounced tyrosine nitration on IRP-1. Notably, IRP-1 nitration by peroxynitrite was progressively reduced to the basal level in cytosols preincubated with increasing concentrations of cis-aconitate. This reduction was accompanied by progressive protection of IRP-1 aconitase activity (Fig. 5B). Parallel control studies demonstrated that 1 mmcis-aconitate did not inhibit nitration of bovine serum albumin induced by 25 μm peroxynitrite. We also observed the same protective effect of cis-aconitate on purified recombinant human IRP-1 as regards both nitration and aconitase inhibition by SIN-1, which spontaneously released a low, steady flux of peroxynitrite at physiological pH (data not shown). These data thus show that the [4Fe-4S] aconitase form of IRP-1, when protected by cis-aconitate, is not sensitive to in vitro nitration by peroxynitrite. Involvement of a Nitrite/H2O2/Myeloperoxidase Pathway in IRP-1 Tyrosine Nitration—In biological systems, endogenous production of peroxynitrite, which results from the simultaneous production of O2·¯ and NO., requires very specific conditions to nitrate proteins efficiently (24Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merenyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Alternative mechanisms have recently been identified in endogenous tyrosine nitration (14Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been reported that nitrite, the primary metabolic end-product of NO., can be oxidized by myeloperoxidase in the presence of H2O2 to yield NO·/O2·¯, the main contributor to tyrosine nitration (25van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Moreover, involvement of this pathway has been outlined in RAW 264.7 cells (15Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34051-34058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the molecular mechanism of intracellular IRP-1 nitration by incubating IFN-γ/LPS- or IFN-γ/LPS/PMA-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages with the potent and selective myeloperoxidase inhibitors ABAH, pHBAH, and SHA (14Eiserich J.P.

After 24 h, nitrite production was measured in cell culture medium, and aconitase activity, as well as nitration of IRP-1, was determined in cell cytosols. We first report, in Figs. 6A and 7A, that peroxynitrite scavengers and myeloperoxidase inhibitors did not prevent inducible NO synthase expression and activity in macrophages stimulated by IFN-γ/LPS in the presence or not of PMA, as indicated by unaffected nitrite production. As expected, IRP-1 aconitase activity was fully inhibited in a"

https://openalex.org/W2168486543,"Abstract Rhodopsin (Rho) has been extracted in n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) from bovine retinal rod outer segments and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose. Because chemical cross-linking of Rho and photoactivated Rho (Rho*) provided initial evidence for the oligomeric nature of the photoreceptor protein, we carried out a hydrodynamic characterization of the native and activated conformations of detergent-solubilized Rho. The molecular weights of the complexes between dark and photoexcited states of Rho and DM were determined by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300, in the presence of 0.1% DM. Subtracting the size of the corresponding detergent micelles resulted in molecular masses of 78 kDa for native Rho and 76 kDa for Rho*. The measured content of 0.97 g of detergent/g of protein resulted in a calculated partial specific volume of 0.765 cm3/g for the protein-detergent complex and a molar mass of 64–65 kDa for the protein moiety. The sizes of Rho·DM and Rho*·DM complexes were also evaluated by sedimentation on 10–30% sucrose gradients, in the presence of 0.1% DM, and molecular masses of about 60 kDa were estimated for both the dark- and light-activated states of the photoreceptor protein. The size of Rho was determined to be 65,300 and 69,800 Da, respectively, when the purified Rho·DM complex was either chromatographed on Sephacryl S-300 or ultracentrifuged on sucrose gradients in the absence of DM. All these results were consistent with a dimeric quaternary structure for both conformations of Rho. Additionally, the functional integrity of the purified photoreceptor protein following gel filtration chromatography and ultracentrifugation was demonstrated by three criteria as follows: (i) its characteristic UV-visible absorption spectra, (ii) its capability to photoactivate transducin, and (iii) its ability to serve as a substrate for rhodopsin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1995039517,"P14/p19ARF (ARF) plays a major role in the activation of p53 by oncogenic signals. The biochemical basis of this has not been fully elucidated. We report here that forced expression of p14ARF enhances phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 (p53S15) in NIH3T3, IMR90 and MCF7 cells. Ectopic expression of the oncogenes c-myc, E2F1 and E1A, all of which activate p53 at least partially via ARF, lead to p53S15 phosphorylation in IMR90 cells. In addition, ectopic expression of p53 also results in p53S15 phosphorylation, suggesting that this is a common event in the ARF-p53 tumor suppression system. Furthermore, p53-, p14ARF-, c-myc- and E2F1-, but not E1A-, induced p53S15 phosphorylation was substantially reduced in AT fibroblasts (GM05823). Downregulation of ATM in MCF7 cells using RNA interference (RNAi) technology significantly attenuated p14ARF- and p53-induced phosphorylation of p53S15. Ectopically expressed ARF in NIH3T3 cells induced ATM nuclear foci and activated ATM kinase. Functionally, ectopic expression of p14ARF and c-myc inhibited the proliferation of IMR90 but not ATM null GM05823 cells, and p14ARF-induced inhibition of MCF7 cell proliferation was significantly attenuated by downregulation of ATM by RNAi. Taken together, these data show a functional role for ATM in ARF-mediated tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2021602500,"We report here some results of a proteomic analysis of changes in protein expression in the leech Hirudo medicinalis in response to septic injury. Comparison of two-dimensional protein gels revealed several significant differences between normal and experimental tissues. One protein found to be up-regulated after septic shock was identified, through a combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and molecular cloning, as a novel member of the hemerythrin family, a group of non-heme-iron oxygen transport proteins found in four invertebrate phyla: sipunculids, priapulids, brachiopods, and annelids. We found by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry that the new leech protein, which we have called neurohemerythrin, is indeed expressed in the leech central nervous system. Both message and protein were detected in the pair of large glia within the ganglionic neuropile, in the six packet glia that surround neuronal somata in each central ganglion, and in the bilateral pair of glia that separate axonal fascicles in the interganglionic connective nerves. No expression was detected in central neurons or in central nervous system microglia. Expression was also observed in many other, non-neuronal tissues in the body wall. Real-time PCR experiments suggest that neurohemerythrin is up-regulated posttranscriptionaly. We consider potential roles of neurohemerythrin, associated with its ability to bind oxygen and iron, in the innate immune response of the leech nervous system to bacterial invasion.

We consider potential roles of neurohemerythrin, associated with its ability to bind oxygen and iron, in the innate immune response of the leech nervous system to bacterial invasion. The nervous system is involved in the control of the major physiological functions leading to homeostasis, including immunity. Kakizaki et al. (1Kakizaki Y. Watanobe H. Kohsaka A. Suda T. Endocr. J. 1999; 46: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have shown that circulating levels of vertebrate proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) increase upon systemic endotoxemia. Systemic inflammation is detected by brain areas directly in contact with vascular vessels, such as the circumventricular organs, and then spreads to other brain areas. Furthermore, pathogens may trigger an innate immune reaction throughout cerebral tissue without having direct access to the brain parenchyma, leading to the concept of “neuroimmunity” (2Rivest S. Lacroix S. Vallieres L. Nadeau S. Zhang J. Laflamme N. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 22-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This inflammation triggers double-edged consequences. On the one hand, inflammation in the brain leads to nuclear factor κB signaling and transcriptional activation of molecules that engage and control the innate immune response for pathogen elimination. On the other hand, proinflammatory molecules may lead to neurotoxicity and, when bacteria penetrate brain tissue, the release of toxic compounds, like reactive oxygen species, which induce necrosis and apoptosis of both neurons and glial cells. These observations show that an innate immune response occurs in the vertebrate brain in response to infection with pathogens. In invertebrates, which lack a system for acquired immunity, defenses against invading pathogens rely solely on innate immunity (3Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

Numerous protective mechanisms, humoral as well as cellular, are used by invertebrates for pathogen elimination from the organism. Humoral mechanisms of innate immunity include the release of antimicrobial peptides (6Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Cellular defenses are based on hemocytic behaviors such as phagocytosis (13Mitta G. Vandenbulcke F. Roch P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), nodulation (14Miller J.S. Nguyen T. Stanley-Samuelson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Insect innate immunity is mainly based on antimicrobial peptides. The discovery of signaling pathways regulating their production as well as the pattern recognition receptors implicated in their activation (16Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.M. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar) have greatly contributed to a better understanding of the key role of the innate immune response in vertebrates and its conservation in course of evolution. Molecules playing a role in innate immunity in peripheral organs (e.g. the fat body in insects) and in circulating fluids (blood or coelomic fluid) (6Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14614-14619Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) are also found in the nervous system. Indeed, lectin family proteins (17Pace K.E. Lebestky T. Hummel T.

Most studies of annelid defenses have reported the isolation of molecules based on their biological activities, such as antimicrobial (21Lassegues M. Milochau A. Doignon F. Du Pasquier L. Valembois P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or pattern recognition receptor properties (22Bilej M. De Baetselier P. Van Dijck E. Stijlemans B.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2354-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), without careful analyses of the mechanisms involved. Among annelids, one of the best known species is the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis, which has been intensively studied since the XIX° century (25Retzius G.

Beobachtungen einer auffallenden bisher unbekannten Structur des Seelenorgans bei Menschen und Thieren. Koenigliche Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin1836Google Scholar). Its central nervous system is by now very well described, with some 400 neurons per segmental ganglia, most of them identified and characterized morphologically and physiologically (27Macagno E.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1980; 190: 283-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The development of the nervous system and its capacity to regenerate accurate synaptic connections after nerve damage are also well documented (28Macagno E.R. Peinado A. Stewart R.R. Proc. Natl.

Because so much is already known about the properties of the normal embryonic and adult CNS, the medicinal leech is an excellent system for the investigation of the mechanisms of the neuronal response to bacterial challenge. Using a global approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we have investigated whether the central nervous system of the leech H. medicinalis responds to bacterial challenge with detectable changes in its profile of protein expression. We report here that, among several significant observable changes, the leech nervous system responds to bacterial challenge by increasing the translation of a member of the Hemerythrin family of oxygen-carrying proteins. Animals—Adult Hirudo medicinalis specimens were obtained from Ricarimpex (France) and kept in artificial pond water for acclimatization for at least 1 week before being used in experiments. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—H. medicinalis central nervous systems were dissected out in leech Ringer (115 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris maleate, pH 7.4), bathed for ex vivo septic shock in 2 × 108 bacteria from a mixture of Gram-positive and negative bacteria (Escherichia coli/Micrococcus luteus) or in phosphate-buffered saline for 6 h before being frozen in liquid nitrogen. Batches of 10 control or experimental central nervous systems were stored prior to molecular analysis at –80 °C. The initial steps in protein extraction consisted of three freezing/defrosting cycles, ultrasonic extraction, and 10% trichloroacetic acid/acetone precipitation. Dried pellets were then incubated 2 h at room temperature in “lysis” buffer (9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 65 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.25% SDS) (32Damerval C. De Vienne D. Zivy M. Thiellement H. Electrophoresis. 1986; 7: 52-54Crossref Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the Peterson method (33Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar). Isoelectrofocusing for the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed with the IEFCell system (Bio-Rad). Immobilized pH 3–10 linear gradient strips were rehydrated in a reswelling solution containing 9 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; ESI-MS-MS, electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; CP, crossing point; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 0.2% v/v Bio-lyte, pH 3–10:pH 5–8:pH 7–9, 1:1:2 (Bio-Rad) and 350 μg or 1 mg of proteins from the nervous system of H. medicinalis (for analytical or preparative electrophoresis, respectively). Rehydration was passive for 6 h, then active at 50 V for 14 h at 20 °C. Isoelectrofocusing voltage was rising gradually until 8000 V and running until 180,000 V·h at 20 °C. After focusing, the strips were incubated with 130 mm DTT in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 375 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.02% Coomassie Blue G-250, pH 8.8) twice 15 min to reduce the proteins according to Wu et al. (34Wu X. Ritter B. Schlattjan J.H. Lessmann V. Heumann R. Dietzel I.D. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Then the proteins were carbamidomethylated for a further 15 min with 135 mm iodoacetamide in equilibration buffer. The immobilized pH 3–10 linear gradient strips were transferred on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.8% of cross-linker piperazine diacrylamide. Electrophoresis was performed in Tris/Tricine buffer according to the conditions defined by Schägger and von Jagow (35Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Proteins were running 1 h at 30 V and then at 150 V until Coomassie Blue reached the bottom of the gel. After electrophoresis, gels were silver-stained according to a modified protocol of Morrissey (36Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar) for Coomassie Blue stain according to Neuhoff (37Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2354) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Image Analysis—Four gels per condition were analyzed using the Progenesis™ v1.5 software program (Nonlinear dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The analysis protocol included spot detection and filtering, whole image warping on a reference gel, background subtraction, average gel creation, spot matching, and volume normalization against the total volume of all protein spots present in the gel. Each analysis step was manually validated. In creating the gel average, one spot absence in the gel series was allowed. Statistical significance was measured by Student's paired t test. Edman Degradation—Two-dimensional spots were excised and eluted according to Shaw (38Shaw C. Thim L. Conlon J.M. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) from Coomassie Blue-stained electrophoresis gels. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on a pulse-liquid automatic peptide PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Applied Biosystems Procise cLC-492 microsequencer. In-gel Digestion for Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Polyacrylamide gel pieces of Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were washed in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile. After drying, they were placed on ice for 30 min in 50 μl of protease solution (sequence grade-modified trypsin, Promega, at 0.02 mg/ml in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate). Excess of protease solution was then removed and replaced by 50 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Digestion was performed overnight at 30 °C. Peptide extraction was performed twice 15 min with 50% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid for further MALDI-MS analysis or with 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid for further ESI-MS-MS analysis. Trypsin digests were then lyophilized in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant) and resuspended in 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 0.1% formic acid. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—MALDI-TOF MS analysis of trypsin digests was performed on a Voyager DE Pro (Applied Biosystems) in reflector mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. One microliter of trypsin digests was spotted on 1 μl of dried α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 15 mg/ml in acetone and covered with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. About 300 laser shots were accumulated to obtain the final spectrum. Mass measurements were then finalized after peak smoothing and internal calibration using the two autolysis trypsin fragments 2211.1 and 842.51. Protein data base searching was performed using MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm) according to the monoisotopic molecular weight of [M+H]+ peptides ions. ESI-MS/MS Analysis—After desalting the samples on a C18 Zip-Tip (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the samples were loaded into nanoES capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark) using a 5-μl on-column syringe. The capillaries were inserted into an Applied Biosystems Q-STAR Pulsar (Q-TOF-MS) using an ion spray source. Doubly charged peptides were selected, fragmented by N2 collision, and analyzed by MS-MS. The MS-MS sequence was manually assigned to search against Swiss-Prot, NCBI, and GenPept using Fasts software (fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www/cgi/search_frm.cgi?pgm=fs) (39Mackey A.J. Haystead T.A. Pearson W.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 139-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Cloning and Sequencing—Total RNA extraction was performed with the TRIzol® kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's conditions. First-strand cDNAs were prepared from these total RNAs with oligo(dT)12–18 for primer. Five micrograms of RNA were first denatured 10 min at 70 °C in the presence of 2 μl of 100 μm primer in a total volume of 26.5 μl. First-strand synthesis was generated in a 40-μl volume by adding 2 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) at 10 mm,1 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 8 μlof5× buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), and 1.5 μl of Superscript II™ (200 units/μl, Invitrogen). Incubation was performed for 55 min at 42 °C, then RNA was hydrolyzed at 55 °C for 15 min in the presence of 1 μl of RNase H. To clone the 5′-end of the cDNA, we added a poly(A) tail to the cDNA first strand. For this, 8 μl of cDNA were mixed with 2 μlof5× buffer, 2 μl of 2 mm ATP, and 1 μl of terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated 15 min at 37 °C followed by 10 min at 65 °C. PCRs were performed in 50-μl mixtures containing 2 μl of firststrand cDNA as a template in PCR buffer 1× (Q-Biogene), 1 μl of primer, and 1 μl of oligo d(T)12–18, each dNTP at 200 μm, and 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR condition involves initial heating at 94 °C for 5 min followed thereafter by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, primer annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Amplification cycles were followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCRs were performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler gradient. The final PCR mixtures were analyzed on 1% (w/v) agarose gel. The PCR products were ligated into the pGEM-T easy vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Dideoxy sequencing reactions of the recombinant plasmids were analyzed with the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Biosciences. The nucleotide sequences were analyzed on an ABI Prism® 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR—Reverse transcription was performed as described above. Specific forward and reverse primers were designed using the LightCycler Probe Design software (Roche Applied Science), based on sequence data from the hemerythrin nucleic acid sequence. The primer sequences were: HEMF1 5′-TTCAGGCTTCTCTCGG-3′ and HEMR1b 5′-GTCAACTTCGACAAATCTGC-3′. Primers for the control gene were designed from the sequence of a protein of the large ribosomal subunit available in a H. medicinalis expressed sequence tag data base: RPL7-aF2, 5′-AATGATGAGGTCAGGCA-3′; RPL7aR2b, 5′-GGATCTCTTCAGCCCTTT-3′. PCRs were set up according to the LightCycler manual (Roche Applied Science). A mastermix of the following reaction components was prepared as follows (final concentrations): 8.6 μl of water, 2.4 μl of MgCl2 (4 mm), 1 μl of forward primer (0.4 μm), 1 μl of reverse primer (0.4 μm), and 2 μl of LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics). LightCycler mastermix (15 μl) was filled in the LightCycler glass capillaries, and 5 μl of cDNA was added as PCR template. All primers were highly purified and salt-free (40Rajeevan M.S. Ranamukhaarachchi D.G. Vernon S.D. Unger E.R. Methods. 2001; 25: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The following LightCycler run protocol was used: denaturation program (95 °C, 10 min), amplification and quantification programs repeated 40 times (95 °C for 15 s, annealing temperature for 5 s, 72 °C for 13s), melting curve program (60–95 °C with a heating rate of 0.1 °C/s and continuous fluorescence measurement), and a cooling step to 40 °C. Analysis of melting curves allowed optimization of annealing temperatures for each amplification product. Single highly specific amplification products were obtained using annealing temperatures ranging from 1 °C below to 1 °C above the Tm of primer pairs. For each reaction, the crossing point (CP) (defined as the cycle number at which the noise band intersects the fluorescent curves) was determined using the “Fit Point Method” of the LightCycler software 3.3 (Roche Diagnostics). PCRs were all set in triplicate, and the mean value of the three CPs was calculated. Intra-assay variation (test precision) of CPs was assessed by the coefficient of variation = (S.D. ± mean) × 100 (40Rajeevan M.S. Ranamukhaarachchi D.G. Vernon S.D. Unger E.R. Methods. 2001; 25: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 41Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25597) Google Scholar). In addition, a no-template control (H2O control) was analyzed for each mastermix. To calculate amplification efficiencies (E) of each target cDNA, relative standard curves were generated using serial dilutions (1, 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, and 1:1000) of a unique leech nervous system cDNA sample consisting of a pool of the three cDNAs to be analyzed (1:1:1). Standard curves were generated by the LightCycler software. They are based on the values of CPs and the log value of the standard cDNA dilution. Real-time PCR efficiencies (E) were calculated from the given slope of the standard curve according to the equation E = 10(–1/slope). For each sample, the level of expression of the target gene was compared with the expression of a large subunit ribosomal gene. As amplification efficiencies for each sample were 2, the expression ratio (R) is calculated according to the formula R = 2(CPribosomal–CPhemerythrin). In Situ Hybridization—A plasmid containing the 3′-end (641 bp) of hemerythrin was used as a template for the preparation of the probes. Digoxigenin-11-UTP and 35S-UTP-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were generated from linearized cDNA plasmids by in vitro transcription using RNA labeling kits (Roche Applied Science) and 35S-UTP (Amersham Biosciences). Total animals or isolated nerve cords of H. medicinalis were fixed 2 h in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After dehydration, tissues were embedded in Paraplast, and 8-μm sections were cut, mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and stored at 4 °C until use. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes (40–100 ng per slide) and 35S-labeled riboprobes (100 ng or 106 counts/min per slide) were hybridized to tissue sections as described previously (42Mitta G. Vandenbulcke F. Noel T. Romestand B. Beauvillain J.C. Salzet M. Roch P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2759-2769PubMed Google Scholar, 43Munoz M. Vandenbulcke F. Saulnier D. Bachere E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2678-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Riboprobes were diluted in hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA from E. coli, 100 mm DTT, and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 55 °C in a humid chamber. Slides were then washed twice (2 × 30 min) with 2× SSC (standard saline citrate), treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml in 2× SSC) for 30 min at 37 °C, and consecutively rinsed twice for 30 min at 55 °C. The probes labeled with digoxigenin-UTP were revealed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies as described previously (42Mitta G. Vandenbulcke F. Noel T. Romestand B. Beauvillain J.C. Salzet M. Roch P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2759-2769PubMed Google Scholar). The 35S-UTP hybridization signal was visualized using autoradiography. Samples were coated by dipping in LM1 Amersham liquid emulsion, immediately dried, and exposed for a 10-day period. At the end of the exposure period, the autoradiograms were developed in D19b (Eastman Kodak Co.), fixed in 30% sodium thiosulfate (10 min at room temperature), stained with toluidine blue, and mounted with XAM mounting medium (Merck). Slides were observed under a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were captured with a system equipped with the Leica IM 1000 software. Controls for in situ hybridization consisted of replacing antisense riboprobe with sense riboprobe. RNase control sections were obtained by adding a preincubation step with 10 μg/ml RNase A prior to hybridization. Immunocytochemistry—A potentially immunogenic region of hemerythrin (HIKGTDFKYKGKL) (His108–Leu120) was chemically synthesized, coupled to ovalbumin, and then used to immunize two New Zealand rabbits according to the protocol of Agrobio (La Ferté St Aubin, France) to recover antisera. Tissue sections obtained as decribed above were preincubated 1 h in TBS (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) containing 1% normal goat serum, 1% ovalbumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Then, sections were incubated overnight at 20 °C in TBS containing 1:400 rabbit anti-hemerythrin antiserum, 1% normal goat serum, 1% ovalbumin, 0.05% Triton X-100. After washes in TBS, sections were incubated for 2 h with a goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-tagged antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:100 in TBS. After washes, slides were mounted in glycerol containing 25% TBS and 0.1% p-phenylenediamine. Labeled cells were observed using a Leica laser scanning microscope (TCS NT) equipped with a Leica (DMIRBE) inverted microscope and an argon/krypton laser. Fluorescein isothiocyanate signal was detected using a 488 nm band pass excitation filter and a 575–640 nm pass barrier filter. Images were acquired sequentially as single transcellular optical sections and averaged over 16 scans/frame. Controls consisted of incubations of anti-hemerythrin immunserum preadsorbed with the His108–Leu120 synthesis peptide. Neurohemerythrin Is Up-regulated following Sepsis—Proteins from leech nervous systems, normal or subjected to sepsis, were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with silver nitrate for image gel analysis using Progenesis™ software. The two-dimensional electrophoretic profile of leech nervous system proteins is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Among the changes observed as a result of sepsis, the increase in the signal of the spot labeled 11/3 was particularly noticeable and was chosen for further analysis. A quantitative assay of the size of the signal (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed that the change in the annotated protein spot 11/3 was significant (p < 0.05; Student's paired t test). The normalized volume of this protein spot, which corresponds to a protein of about 14–15 kDa and a pI between 5 and 6 (Fig. 1A), increased by about 40% over controls following bacterial challenge (Fig. 1B). To identify the 11/3 protein, we first performed an in-gel digestion with trypsin, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. This yielded a peptide mass fingerprint for the 11/3 protein, but this was insufficient information for the immediate identification of the protein because of the current lack of deta"

The main activity is that of synthase (BPGM, EC 5.4.2.4), catalyzing the formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) (1Rose Z.B. J. Biol.

The second activity is that of a mutase (phosphoglycerate mutase, EC 5.4.2.1) catalyzing the interconversion between 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate (Fig. 1B) (4Rosa R. Gaillardon J. Rosa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 36-542Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The third activity, as a phosphatase (S-succinylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.1.3.13), is to catalyze the hydrolysis of 2,3-BPG to 3- or 2-phosphoglycerate and a phosphate (Fig. 1C) (1Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 4810-4820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rose Z.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 248: 1513-1519Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The phosphatase reaction can be stimulated by a number of anions including chloride, phosphate, and particularly by 2-phosphoglycolate (5Rose Z.B. Liebowitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3232-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These three enzymic activities have been found to occur at a unique active site with two different binding sites for the substrates, one for bisphosphoglycerate and another for monophosphoglycerate (6Fothergill-Gilmore L.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14045-14050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). BPGM regulates the level of 2,3-BPG in human blood cells. In vivo, the concentration of 2,3-BPG is determined by the relative activities of the synthase and phosphatase reactions. In red blood cells, 2,3-BPG is the main allosteric effector of hemoglobin. It shifts the equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy conformations of hemoglobins by preferentially stabilizing the unliganded form. Sickle cell anemia is characterized by polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin mutants giving rise to deformed erythrocytes and vaso-occlusive complications. 2,3-BPG has been shown to facilitate this polymerization. The ability to modulate the 2,3-BPG level in vivo would have important implications in the treatment of ischemia and sick cell anemia. One therapeutic approach would be to decrease the intraerythrocytic level of 2,3-BPG by increasing the phosphatase activity of the BPGM. Based on its enzymatic properties and amino acid sequence homology, BPGM is closely related to the glycolytic housekeeping enzyme, cofactor (2,3-BPG)-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM) (8Hass L.F.

In the SCOP data base, BPGM and dPGM are grouped into a superfamily along with fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases and acid phosphatase. Sequence and structural comparisons show that they share a set of conserved residues forming the catalytic core but otherwise exhibit many differences associated with substrate specificities and catalytic activities. For example, the synthase activity of BPGM is higher than dPGM, but the latter has stronger mutase activity. A modest resolution structure of dPGM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was reported in 1974 (10Campbell J.W. Watson H.C. Hodgson G.I. Nature. 1974; 250: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, the high-resolution structures of dPGMs and the complex with their inhibitors were reported (11Rigden D.J. Alexeev D.

However, no BPGM three-dimensional structure information is available, although BPGM has been crystallized (18Cherfils J. Rosa R. Garel M.C. Calvin M.C. Rosa J. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), Here we report the crystal structure of human BPGM (hBPGM) for the first time. Structural comparison of hBPGM and dPGMs show some significant differences between the two groups of enzymes. Gene Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The hBPGM gene was amplified from human brain cDNA library (Clontech) by a PCR using the 5′- and 3′-end special primers 5′ CATATGTCCAAGTACAAACTTATTATG 3′ and 5′ CTCGAGTTTTTTAGCTTGTTTCAC 3′ (Sangon) designed based on the mRNA sequence of hBPGM (GenBank™ accession number X04327). Those oligonucleotides were introduced with NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. Taq polymerase, T-vector, DNA ligase, and the relevant restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara. The polymerase chain reaction product (∼800 bases) was purified with the Gel Extraction mini kit (Watson BioTechnologies) and cloned into a T-vector. The positive clones were identified by restriction digestion. The DNA fragment was ligated into the NdeI/XhoI-cleaved plasmid pET22b (Novagen) to give the pET22b-hBPGM construction that was amplified in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant protein contains eight non-native residues at the C terminus. The integrity of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Single colonies were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth medium with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1) for expression. Cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside after attaining an A600 of 0.4 and grown for an additional 4 h at 310 K. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and lysed by sonication on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and eluted using a step gradient of 0.05-0.5 m imidazole. The fractions were tested for purity by SDS-PAGE. The purified human BPGM protein was desalted and concentrated to 30 mg ml-1, determined by a Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Sample purity and molecular weight (∼30 kDa) were verified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, respectively. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffuse method at 291 K from a protein solution containing hBPGM (30 mg ml-1), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 50 mm NaCl and an equal volume reservoir solution comprising 100 mm HEPESNaOH (pH 7.0) and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000. Crystals appeared after 3 days and kept growing for a week. The diffraction data were collected on a Mar-CCD detector at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (λ = 0.9 Å) at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science. A total of 200 frames of data to 2.5 Å were collected with oscillation range of 1° at 100 K. Data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Molecular replacement was performed with program AmoRe (20Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) using data from 15 to 3.5-Å resolution with S. cerevisiae dPGM (PDB entry: 5PGM) as the searching model. Multiple cycles of refinement were performed with package of CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). The non-crystallography symmetry was applied during all steps of refinement. Water molecules were included near the end of refinement, followed by manual modification in the graphics program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The quality and stereochemistry of the final model was analyzed with PROCHECK (23Laskowsky R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Crystals grew with a rod-shaped morphology and belonged to space group P21 based on the systematic absences in the diffraction data. The unit cell dimensions are a = 38.6 Å, b = 61.8 Å, c = 123.3 Å, β = 95.0° with a solvent content of 48% corresponding to two monomers for each asymmetric unit. The final model refined at a 2.5-Å resolution contains residues from Ser-2 to Asp-250 of the total 267 residues (including the His tag) in each monomer with no definite electron density beyond residue 250. The data in Table I show a well refined structure with excellent stereochemistry. In the Ramachandran plot, 91.4% of the residues are located in the most favored areas, and 8.1% are located in the additional allowed regions. Only one residue, Ser-24, is located at generously allowed regions (discussed below). The model fits well with the corresponding electron density except for the C-terminal residues.Table ISummary of data collection and structure refinementUnit cell (Å °)a = 38.6b = 61.8c = 123.3β = 95.0Resolution limit (Å)30-2.5 (2.61-2.5)Completeness (%)96.0 (97.2)Number of reflections176,376Number of independent reflections18,907Rmerge0.058 (0.183)I/σ9.94 (4.14)R-factoraR-factor=∑||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure factors.0.200 (0.302)RfreebRfree=∑SUB||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑T|Fobs|, where T is a test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement.0.266 (0.337)Number of non-H atoms4,221Protein atoms3,989Water molecules232Average B-factors (Å2)Main chain36.68Side chain37.63Water39.88Root mean square distance of bond lengths (Å)0.007Root mean square distance of bond angles (°)1.34a R-factor=∑||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs|, where Fobs and Fcalc are observed and calculated structure factors.b Rfree=∑SUB||Fobs|−|Fcalc||/∑T|Fobs|, where T is a test data set of 10% of the total reflections randomly chosen and set aside prior to refinement. Open table in a new tab The hBPGM monomer (Fig. 1) contains two domains including six β-strands (named βA-F) and ten α-helices (named α1-10). The α/β-fold of hBPGM resembles that of the dPGMs from S. cerevisiae and E. coli (Fig. 2). The protein core consists of a six β-strand in the order βA, βB, βC, βD, and βF in parallel and strand βE in antiparallel conformations. The β-sheet is flanked by six α-helices. The C-terminal tail ends around the active site. Glu-249 and Asp-250 lie on the center of the active cleft mouth with their side chains oriented from the active cleft. Lys-246 is hydrogen bonded to OE-1 of Glu-249 via its NZ atom. The OE-1 atom of Glu-33 interacts with the NZ atom of Lys-247 by a hydrogen bond. It is noteworthy that there is always an acidic residue at residue 33 in BPGMs. These interactions may make the C-terminal helix (helix 10) more stable and fix it to the active site pocket. The values of the B-factors indicate that the C-terminal region is more flexible compared with the other parts of the molecule. Similarly, in the C-terminal tail, 12 residues cannot be observed in S. cerevisiae dPGM and 9 residues are missing in E. coli dPGM in its unphosphorylated form. The C-terminal residues play an important role in the activities of the enzymes in this family. Removal of the 12 C-terminal residues from S. cerevisiae dPGM is associated with loss of mutase activity but no change in phosphatase activity (26Walter R.A. Nairn J. Duncan D. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Rigden D.J. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The deletion of the last seven residues completely abolished the three catalytic activities of the hBPGM (9Garel M.-C. Joulin V. Le Boulch P. Calvin M.-C. Prehu M.-O. Arous N. Longin R. Rosa R. Rosa J. Cohen-Solal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18966-18972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal residues would be involved in transferring a phosphoryl group to the internal active site (27Winn S.I. Watson H.C. Harkins R.N. Fothergill L.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1981; 293: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the disordering of the C-terminal tail appears to be a common feature in both of BPGMs and of dPGMs and could accommodate the access of the substrate to the active site. hBPGM forms a dimer in the crystal in agreement with those observed in solution (5Rose Z.B. Liebowitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3232-3241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimer is formed between the surface of the βC strands and α3 helices of the two monomers with a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 3) similar to E. coli dPGM and S. cerevisiae dPGM. The side chains of Ile-64, Trp-68, Leu-69, Leu-71, and Val-81 form a hydrophobic dimerization core. Specifically, the side chains of Trp-68 from both monomers stack with each other across the 2-fold axis. Those hydrophobic residues are conserved in all BPGMs and the dimerized dPGMs but not in Schizosaccharomyces pombe dPGM, which is a monomer. In addition, the salt bridge between Lys-29 and Glu-72 and several hydrogen bonds formed by Glu-51, Phe-52, Asp-53, His-65, Glu-77, and Arg-140 strengthen the dimer interactions. Arg-140 forms two hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Phe-52 and to the OD-2 atom of Asp-53 via its NH2 atom and forms a hydrogen bond to the OE-1 atom of Glu-51 via its NE atom. His-65 forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Glu-77 via its NE-2 atom. All of these residues discussed above are conserved in BPGMs. The two subunits of the dimer show few differences when overlaid. The root mean square distance between their Cα atoms is 0.51 Å. The following discussion is based on the structure of monomer A. Sequences Alignment and Backbone Comparison—Similarities of the hBPGM structure to some dPGM structures (PDB codes 5PGM, 1E58, 1E59, 1QHF, and 1FTZ) were analyzed using the program DALI (28Homl L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) and LSQMAN (24Kleywegt G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A structure-based sequence alignment of BPGMs and dPGMs is shown in Fig. 4. The sequence of hBPGM is ∼50% identical to dPGMs. The catalytic site residues Arg-10, His-11, Arg-62, Glu-89, Arg-90, Arg-116, Arg-117, and His-188 are conserved in all of them. However, some residues involved in the substrate binding in dPGMs have been substituted in BPGMs (discussed below). The topology of the α/β domain of BPGM shows considerable similarity to dPGMs. A superposition of hBPGM with the structure of S. cerevisiae dPGM and E. coli dPGM yields root mean square distances of 0.69 and 0.74 Å, respectively, for Cα atoms in 124 residues in three regions (hBPGM residues 4-11, 25-97, and 157-199), indicating strong structural homology within those regions, consistent with the concept that BPGM and dPGM are structurally homologous enzymes. The most significant variations in the backbone occur in the regions 13-21, 98-117, 127-151, and the C-terminal tail (Fig. 2). With a four-residue insertion at residues 136, 137, 143, and 144, an additional α-helix is formed from residue 133 to 138, resulting in the different conformations at the region of residues 127-151. This region is far away from the active site, and the structural differences would not contribute to the catalytic activity. The fragments 13-21, 98-117, and the C-terminal fragment surround the active site. These conformational changes may have significant effect on the enzymatic activity. Residues Specific for BPGMs—There are 24 residues (Fig. 4, pink) that are identical in BPGMs but differ from those in dPGMs. Among them, Glu-77 is involved in the interactions between the two subunits by forming a hydrogen bond with His-65. Ser-63 and Ser-186, in which the equivalent residues are both Ala in dPGMs located near the active site, form two hydrogen bonds between their main-chain and side-chain oxygen atoms. The hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-192 forms three hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of His-188 and Gly-189, and the main-chain nitrogen atom of Arg-193. These additional hydrogen bonds may help stabilize the structure. Gly-14 is a critical BPGM-specific residue. A mutation of Gly-14 of hBPGM to Ser did not modify the synthase activity, whereas the mutase and phosphatase activities were 2-fold increased or decreased, respectively. However, replacing Gly-14 with Arg enhanced phosphatase activity by 28.6-fold, whereas synthase and mutase activities were decreased 10-fold (30Garel M.C. Arous N. Calvin M.C. Craescu C.T. Rosa J. Rosa R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3593-3597Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In dPGMs, the equivalent residue Ser interacts with the substrate (12Rigden D.J. Walter R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In prostatic acid phosphatase, Arg-15, the equivalent residue of Gly-14 of BPGM, points toward the active site and is involved in the substrate binding too (31Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Vihko P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32LaCount M.W. Handy G. Lebioda L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30406-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Ortlund E. LaCount M.W. Lebioda L. Biochem. 2003; 42: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the conformation around Gly-14 varies significantly. As a consequence, the side chain of Glu-13 in hBPGM points toward the active site, forming a hydrogen bond network with Arg-10, His-11, Glu-89, and Gly-189 via three water molecules, whereas the equivalent residue of dPGMs orients away from the active site. Glu-89 is conserved in all BPGMs and dPGMs. In mutase activity, Glu-89 acts as an acid or a base during enzyme phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (12Rigden D.J. Walter R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The phosphotransfer step of the mutase reaction requires a proton to be transferred to or from Glu-89. The hydrogen bond between Glu-13 and the side chain of Glu-89 would affect the protonation ability of Glu-89, so that the mutase activity is lower in BPGMs. In contrast, the first phosphotransfer of the synthase reaction involves the transfer of an acyl-phospho group and does not require a proton to be transferred (6Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). Ser-24 is reported to be involved in the binding of both monophosphoglycerates and 2-phosphoglycolate (7Ravel P. Craescu C.T. Arous N. Rosa J. Carel M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14045-14050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This position is conserved as a Gly in all dPGMs. It was proposed that its backbone nitrogen atom interacts with the substrate carboxylate group (15Bond C. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because its dihedral angle is located in a general allowed region in the Ramachandran plot, it was predicted that Ser-24 would be the major reason for the different enzymatic activities of BPGMs and dPGMs by adopting a different dihedral values and changing the main-chain conformation (12Rigden D.J. Walter R.A. Phillips S.E.V. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Bond C. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our hBPGM structure, no significant structural change was observed except the side chain of Ser-24 was added. Although the Ser-24 side chain fits the electron density well, its conformation is in an unfavorable region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 6). The unfavorable stereochemistry may be compensated by the formation of a hydrogen bond between its hydroxyl oxygen and the backbone nitrogen atom of Tyr-92. Its carbonyl oxygen maintains contact with the NH2 atom of Arg-62 as in dPGMs. So it is unlikely that Ser-24 plays an important role in distinguishing the activities of BPGMs and dPGMs. Active Site and the Substrate Binding Pocket—The active site pocket was found at the carboxyl end of the parallel β-strands of the α/β-domain. His-11 and His-188 are located at the bottom of the active site pocket as well as Arg-10 and Arg-62. The mouth of the cleft is defined by Lys-18, Asn-20, Arg-100, and Arg-116 on one side and Ile-208, Asn-209, and Thr-211 on the other side (Fig. 5). Residues 246-250 lie on the surface of the active site pocket. The general shape of the active cleft looks similar to those of dPGMs, but the details differ resulting from the conformational changes at regions of 13-21, 98-117, and the C termini. The catalytic site cleft contains many basic residues resulting in a highly positive electrostatic potential accommodating for the negative charged substrates as dPGMs. His-11 and His-188 are conserved in BPGMs and dPGMs. In the hBPGM structure, their side chains adopt very similar conformations to those in the structure of dPGM (Fig. 5). His-11 was proposed to accept a phosphate group during the reactions (6Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). His-188 was confirmed to be very important for catalysis, but its precise function is still speculative (34White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35White M.F. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the hBPGM structure, the NE-2 atom of His-11 forms a hydrogen bond to the ND-1 atom of His-188. The hydroxyl group of Ser-58 is hydrogen-bonded to atom NE-2 of His-188. This interaction is also conserved in dPGMs in the rat prostatic acid phosphatase (between Thr-75 and His-257) and in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (between Ser-52 and His-141), suggesting they contribute to the correct orientation of the His-188 imidazole ring. Most of the residues involved in bisphosphoglycerate binding (Arg-10, Asn-17, Arg-62, Glu-89, Arg-90, Tyr-92, Arg-116, Arg-117, and Asn-190) are conserved in BPGMs as in dPGMs. Upon a superposition of the structures of hBPGM and dPGMs, Arg-10, Arg-62, Glu-89, Arg-90, and Asn-190 fit well; Asn-17, Arg-116, and Arg-117 shift with the backbone movement. The side chains of Arg-116 and Arg-117 are flexible and cannot be observed in the electron density map. Thr-20 and Lys-97 (numbered as in dPGMs), in which the side chains were proposed to be involved in 2,3-BPG binding in dPGMs, are substituted by Cys-23, and Arg-100, respectively, in hBPGM. Cys-23 is conserved in BPGMs and in muscle dPGM leading to a susceptibility to inactivation by Hg2+ (6Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). In hBPGM, the guanidinium group of Arg-62, which is necessary for substrate binding, contacts the SH group of Cys-23 in van der Waals distance. If a positively charged Hg2+ bound to Cys-23, it should push away the same positively charged Arg-62 and prevent the substrate from binding. It also should be noted that in dPGMs, the side chain of Lys-97 points toward the active site pocket. However, in hBPGM, the equivalent residue Arg-100 turns its side chain away from the active site ∼90°, toward the surface of the active cleft. It was reported that the substrate binding is not the rate-limited step, and the different catalytic ability of BPGMs and dPGMs is caused mainly by the phosphorylation rates of 1,3-BPG and 2,3-BPG (36Rose Z.B. Dube B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4817-4822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the moving away of Arg-100 is necessary for the specificity of phosphorylation needs to be investigated further. Compared with dPGMs, the space around the catalytic His-11 is more crowded in hBPGM. Several backbone and residue differences contribute to this. First, the backbone of residues 13-21 shifts with a distance of 5.0 Å between Glu-19 and its equivalent residue in S. cerevisiae dPGM. Second, the side chain of Glu-13 points toward the active site, and the side chain of Phe-22 rotates closer to the catalytic His-11 leading to the small active site space. As the consequence, the 2,3-BPG binding model of E. coli dPGM (15Bond C. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) cannot be adopted in hBPGM without the backbone or side-chain movements, because the side chain of Glu-13 leads to the steric clash with the phospho group near the catalytic site, and the side chains of Tyr-92 and Phe-22 lead to steric clash with the distal phospho group of 2,3-BPG. Moreover, the binding model of 3-phosphoglycerate to S. cerevisiae dPGM observed experimentally (37Glina S.C. Andrew R.D. Michail N.I. John W.C. Jenifer A.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1822-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) cannot be adopted by hBPGM, in which Glu-13 occupies the position of the ligand, either. If the similar binding mode remains in hBPGM, large conformational changes should happen upon the substrate binding. It also should be noted that the binding of dPGMs with 2,3-BPG is only a theoretical model derived from the complex of E. coli dPGM and a liner tetravanadate (15Bond C. White M.F. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We are trying to obtain the hBPGM-substrate complex crystals, which will provide deeper insight into the binding and catalytic mechanism. The narrower active cleft and varieties of residues involved in substrate binding could be another reason for different phosphorylation rates of BPGMs and dPGMs by 2,3- and 1,3-BPG, respectively, which leads to the different mutase and synthase activities. The mutase reaction requires that the 2,3-BPG stay as an intermediate and change its orientation in the active site during each round of catalysis (6Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Watson H.C. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1989; 62: 227-313PubMed Google Scholar). However, in hBPGM, the narrower active site pocket would limit the reorientation of 2,3-BPG. Although in the synthase reaction, 2,3-BPG should be released as a product. In conclusion, hBPGM is similar in the folding, dimerization pattern, and the active site architectures to dPGMs as predicted from the sequence homology. The major structural variations occur at residues 13-21, 98-117, 127-151, and the C-terminal tail. Gly-14 may have caused the most important conformational changes where the inside flipping of Glu-13, together with the relocation of Phe-22, resulted in a more crowded substrate binding pocket and could prevent 2,3-BPG from binding in the way that was proposed in dPGMs. In addition, the side chain of Glu-13 would affect Glu-89 protonation ability that is critical for the mutase activity.

https://openalex.org/W1976733953,"The discovery of sequence motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions, coupled with the availability of protein amino acid sequence data, allows for the identification of putative protein binding pairs. The present studies were based on our identification of an amino acid sequence in phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) that fits the consensus sequence for a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) binding site, termed the D-domain. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), an MAPK, and phospho-ERK2 were bound by an immobilized peptide sequence containing the identified PLC-γ1 D-domain. Furthermore, a peptide containing the PLC-γ1 D-domain was able to competitively inhibit the in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant PLC-γ1 by recombinant phospho-ERK2, whereas a control peptide derived from a distant region of PLC-γ1 was ineffective. Similarly, the peptide containing the PLC-γ1 D-domain, but not the control peptide, competitively inhibited the in vitro phosphorylation of Elk-1 and c-Jun catalyzed by recombinant phospho-ERK2 and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (phospho-JNK3), another type of MAPK, respectively. Incubation of anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes isolated from rat brain with recombinant phospho-ERK2 opposed the increase in PLC-γ1-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 (PtdIns(4,5)P2), which was produced by a tyrosine kinase associated with the immunocomplexes, whereas in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant PLC-γ1 by recombinant phospho-ERK2 did not alter PLC-γ1-catalyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. These studies have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanism for the integration of PLC-γ1- and ERK2-dependent signaling.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a proline residue in the –2 position is favorable and yields the optimal consensus substrate sequence of PX(S/T)P, where X is any amino acid (1Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three families of MAPK have been identified: extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also called stress-activated protein kinase), and p38 stress-activated protein kinase (p38; also called RK/CSBP). Multiple members of each of these MAPK families have been cloned. MAPKs exist in an inactive, unphosphorylated form and an active, phosphorylated form. MAPKs are converted to the active, phosphorylated form by dual-specificity kinases termed MAPK kinases or MAPK/ERK kinases (MEKs), which phosphorylate threonine and tyrosine (Y) residues in the enzymes (2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar, 3Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers G.T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr.

Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3438) Google Scholar).It has been estimated that ∼90% of all proteins contain an (S/T)P sequence, yet, not all of these proteins are substrates for MAPKs (5Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27256-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This indicates that MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of a substrate involves the interaction (docking) of the kinase with a site on the substrate that is distinct from the phosphoacceptor site. Kornfeld and colleagues (5Fantz D.A. Jacobs D. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27256-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Jacobs D. Glossip D.

In addition to conferring specificity, docking domains may increase the efficiency of substrate phosphorylation (7Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D.

The location of the MAPK docking site can be either N- or C-terminal to the phosphorylation site (10Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. Biochem.

The sites on ERKs that are involved in substrate binding have also been identified: the common docking site, which binds the D-domain of the substrate (13Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of these clones reveals that PLC isozymes may be grouped into four types: PLC-β, PLC-δ, PLC-γ, and PLC-ϵ; the present studies focus on PLC-γ1. Growing evidence implicates PLC-γ1asan important component of signal transduction processes involved in various cellular processes, including mitogenesis, differentiation, transformation, and neuronal plasticity (18Carpenter G. Ji Q. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). It is important to note that some PLC-γ-mediated cellular responses have been shown to be independent of PLC-γ lipase activity (19Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Matthews N.T. Rhee S.G. Sung W.K. Kung H.F. Proc.

For example, Morrison et al. (23Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the MEK, Raf, co-immunoprecipitates with, as well as phosphorylates, PLC-γ1. Rong et al. (24Rong R. Ahn J.Y. Chen P. Suh P.G. Ye K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52497-52503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) reported that activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway in PC12 cells by nerve growth factor requires PLC-γ1 enzyme activity. We demonstrate that ERK2 and phospho-ERK2 interact with PLC-γ1 both in vitro and within rat brain and that this interaction has functional significance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 days old) were maintained as described in Weeber et al. (25Weeber E.J. Savage D.D. Sutherland R.J. Caldwell K.K. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2001; 76: 151-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The rats were given unlimited access to standard rat chow and tap water. All procedures employed for the housing, handling, and sacrificing of rats were approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Peptide Synthesis—All peptides and peptide columns were commercially synthesized by BIOSOURCE International (Hopkinton, MA). Both of the peptides used in the kinase inhibition assays demonstrated the same solubility in water. Neither peptide altered the pH of the reaction buffers in these assays.PLC-γ1 D-domain Peptide Pull-down Assay—Peptides containing the sequence of the PLC-γ1 D-domain (RRKKIALELSELVVYC, rat PLC-γ1 amino acids 945–960) or a control sequence form PLC-γ1 (FLETNTLRTGERPELC, rat PLC-γ1 amino acids 232–247) were synthesized (>90% purity) and coupled to thiol agarose (1 mg of peptide per ml of resin). Binding of recombinant ERK2 (unactive) and phospho-ERK2 (active) to the peptide-coupled agarose was performed employing a procedure adapted from Zhang et al. (26Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A. Ji Q.S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9021-9026Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ng of ERK2, or 50 ng of phospho-ERK2, per 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 320 mm sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 75 mm KCl, and 16 mm (1%, v/v) Triton X-100) were incubated with 50 μl (packed volume) of D-domain or control peptide agarose at 4 °C for 2 h with mixing. The agarose was collected by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 4 min, room temperature) and washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% w/v polyacrylamide gels), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed for anti-ERK2 or anti-phospho-ERK2 immunoreactivity as described below.In Vitro Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1—Recombinant PLC-γ1 and PLC-γ2 were prepared essentially as described in Park et al. (27Park D. Jhon D.Y. Kriz R. Knopf J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16048-16055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One microgram of recombinant PLC-γ1 or PLC-γ2 preparation was incubated (30 °C, 20 min, and 25-μl final volume) in kinase reaction buffer (for phospho-ERK2: Assay Dilution Buffer I (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% (v/v) Brij-35); for phospho-JNK3: 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3.6 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 4.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1.05 mm EGTA, 3.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.18 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mg BSA/ml, 0.015% (v/v) Brij-35; and for phospho-p38γ: 30 mm Tris-HCl, 0.03 mm EGTA, 0.1 mg BSA/ml, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), 13.5 mm MgCl2, and 90 μm [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi) in the absence or presence of recombinant phospho-ERK2 (100 ng), phospho-JNK3 (100 ng), or phospho-p38γ (250 ng). Control reactions were incubated in the absence of protein kinase. Peptide competition studies were performed by preincubating (10 min, 30 °C) 50 ng phospho-ERK2 in the presence of 100 μm PLC-γ1 D-domain (MERRKKIALELSELVVYCRPVPFD, rat PLC-γ1 amino acids 943–966) or PLC-γ1 Control (YSAQKTMDLPFLETNTLRTGERPEL, rat PLC-γ1 amino acids 222–246) peptide in kinase reaction buffer/MgCl2/ATP solution (see above). Control reactions were performed in the absence of phospho-ERK2 and peptide. Reactions were initiated by addition of recombinant PLC-γ1 (1 μg/reaction) and continued for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by heating (100 °C, 6 min). The entire mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% w/v polyacrylamide gels) then transferred to PVDF, and 32P-labeled PLC-γ1 was detected by autoradiography. In addition, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 to measure protein loading. Briefly, the PVDF membrane was immersed in a 0.025% (w/v) Brilliant Blue R-250 solution containing 40% (v/v) methanol for 5 min at room temperature, then destained for 15 min in 40% (v/v) methanol.Phosphorylation of c-Jun and Elk-1—MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun and Elk-1 was preformed employing a procedure based on a method described by Ho et al. (28Ho D.T. Bardwell A.J. Abdollahi M. Bardwell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32662-32672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Elk-1 was performed as follows. His-tagged phospho-ERK2 (12.5 ng) was incubated (20 min, 30 °C, 25-μl reaction volume) with 1 μg of recombinant fusion protein of GST-tagged Elk-1, residues 301–428, in phospho-ERK2 kinase reaction buffer (see above), 13.5 mm MgCl2, and 90 μm [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi) in the absence or presence of the PLC-γ1 D-domain peptide (in a 1:2 dilution series starting at 100 μm and ending at 12.5 μm) or 100 μm PLC-γ1 control peptide. The phospho-ERK2 was preincubated with the appropriate peptide for 10 min at 30 °C prior to adding the substrate to initiate the kinase reaction. The peptide sequences for the PLC-γ1 D-domain and Control peptides were the same as used in the PLC-γ in vitro phosphorylation studies. Reactions were terminated and processed as described above for in vitro phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. Equal loading of PVDF membranes was assessed using Brilliant Blue R-250 staining as described above.Kinase reactions (25 μl) for phospho-JNK3 (1 ng) phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (300 ng) were performed in JNK3 kinase reaction buffer (see above), 13.5 mm MgCl2, 90 μm [γ-32P]ATP (15 μCi), and the indicated concentration of peptide. Again, phospho-JNK3 kinase was preincubated with the appropriate peptide for 10 min at 30 °C prior to adding the substrate. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and were analyzed as described above.Tissue Preparation and Subcellular Fractionation—Preparation of Triton X-100 extracts of rat whole brain postnuclear (S1) fraction and hippocampal formation postnuclear membrane (P2) fraction were performed as described in Buckley and Caldwell (29Buckley C.T. Caldwell K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) except buffers also contained 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride.Affinity Capture of Anti-PLC-γ1 Immune Complexes—Anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes were isolated as follows. For determinations of anti-ERK2 immunoreactivities, whole rat brain S1 fraction (100 μg of protein) was incubated with 6 μg of rabbit anti-PLC-γ1 antibody overnight with mixing at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads and washed twice with 1 ml of extraction buffer supplemented with 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride, as described in Weeber et al. (25Weeber E.J. Savage D.D. Sutherland R.J. Caldwell K.K. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2001; 76: 151-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For GST pull-down assays, whole rat brain S1 fraction (100 μg of protein) was incubated with glutathione-agarose precoupled to a GST fusion protein of the PLC-γ1 SH2-SH2-SH3 domains or glutathione-agarose control beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was decanted and incubated with 6 μg of rabbit anti-PLC antibodies or non-immune rabbit IgG. The immunocomplexes and controls were processed as described above. For in vitro PLC activity measurements, anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes were immobilized on 96-well plates, as described elsewhere (29Buckley C.T. Caldwell K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Anti-ERK2 immunoreactivity associated with anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes or bound by immobilized D-domain peptides was measured as follows. Fifty microliters of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the sample, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated using 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels prior to transfer to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline and blotted with mouse anti-ERK2 antibody (1:1000) followed by anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:3000). The immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence.In Vitro Treatment of Anti-PLC-γ1 Immunocomplexes with Phospho-ERK2—Anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes were captured from 20 μg of rat hippocampal P2 preparation, then incubated (20 min, 35 °C) in the presence of one of the following buffers: A) Assay Dilution Buffer I plus 20 μm protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor peptide, and 20 μm Compound R24571; B) Buffer A containing 0.4 unit of recombinant phospho-ERK2; C) Buffer A supplemented with 13.5 mm MgCl2 and 90 μm ATP; or D) Buffer C with 0.4 unit of recombinant phospho-ERK2. The wells were washed three times (5 min each) with 1.25× PLC assay buffer (43.75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 87.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm CaCl2) prior to quantification of PLC activity (see below). The in vitro treatment of recombinant PLC-γ1 with recombinant phospho-ERK2 was performed as described for the anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes captured from rat hippocampal P2 preparation, except 100 ng of recombinant PLC-γ1 was first captured onto the microtiter plate prior to the in vitro treatment, or not, with recombinant phospho-ERK2. In addition, incubation of recombinant PLC-γ1 with Buffer C was omitted due to the failure of detecting [γ-32P]phosphate incorporation in the absence of kinase (Fig. 3A). Recombinant PLC-γ1 lipase activity was then quantified as described below.Immunocomplex PLC Activity Measurement—PLC activity associated with anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes was quantified as described in Buckley and Caldwell (29Buckley C.T. Caldwell K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Activity was calculated as nanomoles of Ins(1,4,5)P3 product formed/min/mg of protein present in the sample from which the enzyme was affinity captured.MATERIALS AND METHODSRabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against PLC-γ1, mouse monoclonal antibody to ERK2, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, glutathione agarose, glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein comprising the SH2-SH2-SH3 domains of PLC-γ1 pre-coupled to agarose, as well as each of the three individual domains pre-coupled to agarose, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar): 1) the FXFP motif, having the consensus sequence of FXFP and 2) the D-domain, having two possible consensus sequences: (K/R)X(X/K/R)(K/R)X(1-4)(L/I)X(L/I) or (K/R)(K/R)(K/R)X(1-5)(L/I)X(L/I). We did not find an FXFP sequence but did identify overlapping sequences that conform to the two consensus D-domain sequences: 945RRKKIAL(EL). In addition, we searched for potential ((S/T)P) and optimal (PX(S/T)P) MAPK phosphorylation sites in the primary sequence of PLC-γ1 (Fig. 1A). Seven (S/T)P sequences were identified, but none fit the optimal sequence for MAPK phosphorylation. We also searched the primary structure of ERK2 (Fig. 1B) for possible PLC-γ1-interacting domains. We identified a sequence (224PIFP) that fits the minimum consensus sequence (PXXP) of an SH3 domain binding motif (30Alexandropoulos K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1995; 92: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified a sequence (112KLLKTQHLSNDHI) that demonstrates homology to a PLC-γ1 binding site (KLLMIIHDRREFA) on the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1A (31Vossmeyer D. Hofmann W.

We detected only minimal anti-phospho-ERK2 immunoreactivity associated with anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes (data not shown).Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-γ1 and ERK2 is not affected by preclearing rat brain S1 preparations of proteins that bind to PLC-γ1 SH2 and SH3 domains.A, rat brain S1 fraction was incubated overnight with PLC-γ1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies, or normal rabbit IgG. Immunocomplexes were recovered using Protein A-coated Sepharose beads and washed three times with buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Anti-ERK-2 immunoreactivity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, rat brain S1 fraction was mixed with either glutathione-agarose or agarose-bound fusion protein consisting of the PLC-γ1 N-SH2, C-SH2, and SH3 domains fused with glutathione S-transferase. The beads were collected by centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated as in A. For both A and B the results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We tested the hypothesis that ERK2 found associated with anti-PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates was bound, either directly or indirectly (i.e. mediated by a second, intermediary protein), to the SH2 and/or SH3 domains of PLC-γ1. We performed preliminary experiments in which we incubated rat whole brain S1 fraction (100 μg) with a fusion protein comprising the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and SH3 domains of rat PLC-γ1 pre-coupled to agarose (50 μg), or with each of these three domains individually coupled to agarose (50 μg). These studies demonstrated specific binding of ERK2 to the combined SH2-SH2-SH3 agarose, as well as the C-terminal SH2 domain, but not with the N-terminal SH2 domain or the SH3 domain (data not shown). ERK2 within rat brain S1 extracts failed to bind to C-terminal SH2 beads following pre-clearing of the extracts with the C-terminal SH2 beads (50 μg), even though a significant amount of ERK2 was still present within the sample (data not shown). These studies demonstrated that rat brain ERK2 indirectly binds to the PLC-γ1 C-terminal SH2 domain in vitro. However, pre-clearing of rat whole brain S1 preparations (100 μg) with an excess (50 μg) of agarose-coupled GST-SH2-SH2-SH3 domains of PLC-γ1 prior to isolation of anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes did not dissociate the ERK2·PLC-γ1 complex (Fig. 2B). This approach is analogous to a procedure described by Snyder and colleagues (32Ye K. Aghdasi B. Luo H.R. Moriarity J.L. Wu F.Y. Hong J.J. Hurt K.J. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Snyder S.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), who reported that in the presence of 10 μg of GST-PLC-γ1 SH3 domain co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-γ1 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer is blocked. Thus, these studies demonstrate that, although ERK2 can bind indirectly to the PLC-γ1 C-terminal SH2 domain in vitro, the PLC-γ1 SH2 and SH3 domains do not significantly contribute to the binding of ERK2 within anti-PLC-γ1 immunocomplexes isolated from rat brain.Phospho-ERK2 Directly Interacts with and Phosphorylates PLC-γ1 in Vitro—The identification of a putative ERK2 docking site in PLC-γ1 and co-immunoprecipitation of PLC-γ1 and ERK2 indicated that the two proteins may directly bind to each other.

https://openalex.org/W1979845756,"Upon hypotonic volume expansion, skate erythrocytes lose solutes via a pathway that requires participation of anion exchangers (AEs). Three skate AE isoforms (skAEs) are expressed, and at least skAE1 has been shown to mediate this effect when expressed in oocytes. Under isoosmotic conditions, only a small fraction of skAE1 is expressed on the external plasma membrane. Under these conditions, a portion of skAE1 may be found in non-ionic detergent-insoluble regions. However, the detergent-insoluble material is found intracellularly. Cellular volume expansion by hypoosmotic volume expansion but not volume expansion by isoosmotic medium by permeant solutes (ethylene glycol, diethyl urea, or ammonium chloride) stimulates the appearance of skAE1 in the external plasma membrane, and a significant portion of this is found in detergent-insoluble regions. Upon hypoosmotic volume expansion nearly half of the skAE1 is found as oligomers. SkAE1 in these detergent-insoluble fractions is highly tyrosine phosphorylated. These data suggest that volume expansion by hypoosmotic medium stimulates movement of skAE1 from an intracellular pool contained in detergent-insoluble lipid rafts to the plasma membrane.

Upon volume expansion, cells will swell and must lose water. To decrease volume, cells will undergo a regulatory volume decrease that involves the loss of a number of solutes and, therefore, water that follows these solutes. A large number of pathways exist in various cells to accomplish this regulatory volume decrease. Electrolytes, notably K+ and Cl–, may exit through KCl cotransport in a variety of cell types (1Jenssen F. J. Exp. Biol. 1995; 198: 155-165PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell.

Many cells utilize the efflux of non-metabolized non-electrolytes such as betaine, sorbitol, and the β-amino acid taurine (for reviews, see Refs. 7Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J.

The nature and regulation of pathway(s) for efflux of these solutes during the regulatory volume decrease have received considerable attention, and in some cells involve members of the anion exchanger (AE) 1The abbreviations used are: AE, anion exchanger; skAE, skate AE; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; MBCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; EIM, elasmobranch incubation medium. family. Although best known for their role in Cl–/HCO–3 exchange in red cells, AEs appear to participate in the loss of taurine in red blood cells of certain species, including trout (9Garcia-Romeu F.

AEs have been cloned from trout and skate, and while many similarities with human and murine AEs exist, significant differences are present as well (15Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Guizouarn H. Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 193: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Indeed expression of trout or skate red cell AEs, but not human or murine red cell AEs, in oocytes results in increased transport of taurine (15Fievet B. Gabillat N. Borgese F. Motais R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5158-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Koomoa D.-L. Musch M.W. Goldstein L., J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These data support past work using pharmacologic inhibition of red cell AEs, which block volume-expanded stimulated taurine efflux, as well as a phylogenetic approach demonstrating that red cells from species that have little or no AE activity (e.g. lamprey and hagfish) do not elicit volume-expanded stimulation of taurine efflux. Regulation of transporter activities is complex and may involve multiple mechanisms of regulation. Transporters exist in the external or plasma membrane, and their activity in this location may be regulated directly by biochemical events such as phosphorylation or association with adaptor/accessory proteins. Transport activity may also be regulated by the number of transport proteins inserted into the external membrane through exocytosis. A previous study on skate red blood cells demonstrated increased binding of a ligand for the AEs, e.g. the stilbene DIDS (18Musch M.W. Leffingwell T.R. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R65-R74PubMed Google Scholar), during hypotonic volume expansion. Using proteolytic digests, no new binding sites could be identified. It appeared that additional transporters may have been introduced into the plasma membrane. The goals of the present study were to determine whether additional skAE1 could be identified in the plasma membrane and to determine the membrane domain(s) in which the exchangers reside. Non-ionic detergents have been used to define regions of the plasma membrane that are rich in cholesterol and glyco-/sphingolipids with high saturated fatty acids. Due to the lipid interactions, these regions are insoluble in many mild, non-ionic detergents and have been called lipid rafts (19Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 20Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Recent work supports a large diversity of these lipid raft regions with respect to protein as well as lipid composition. Therefore, we aimed to determine the distribution of skAE1 in these lipid raft regions upon volume expansion. Isolation and Taurine Uptake of Skate Erythrocytes—Little skates (Raja erinacea) were caught off Frenchman's Bay, ME, or Woods Hole, MA and kept in running seawater. Blood was removed from a tail vessel into a heparinized syringe. Cells were pelleted (400 × g for 2 min at room temperature), and the plasma and buffy coat were removed by aspiration. Erythrocytes were resuspended in 5 volumes of isotonic (940 mosmol/liter) elasmobranch incubation medium (940 EIM) (300 mmol/liter NaCl, 5.2 mmol/liter KCl, 2.7 mmol/liter MgSO4, 5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 370 mmol/liter urea, 15 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4), washed twice, and resuspended at 50% hematocrit in 940 EIM. To volume expand the cells, erythrocytes were diluted 1:10 into 460 EIM (NaCl was reduced to 100 mm, and urea was reduced to 250 mm). To each incubation, [3H]taurine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added (1 μCi/ml), and at varying times thereafter, aliquots were removed, added to appropriate osmolarity EIM with 10 mm unlabeled taurine, and pelleted (500 × g for 2 min at room temperature). Pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of appropriate osmolarity EIM with 0.1 mm taurine, pelleted, and washed a second time in these media. Pellets were extracted with 10% (w/v) perchloric acid, allowed to sit on ice for at least 15 min, and protein-precipitated (2000 × g for 5 min at room temperature); the supernatant was removed; and 3H was quantitated by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Separation of skAE1 in Varying Membrane Domains—Red blood cell membranes were isolated by protocols published previously (21Musch M.W. Hubert E. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Biol.

Briefly red cell ghosts were made by lysing cells in 20 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (Complete inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF). Ghosts were pelleted (10,000 × g for 10 s), and the process was repeated until no hemoglobin appeared in the pellet (generally a total of four times). The ghosts were resuspended in 2 ml of buffer and sonicated for three pulses of 20 s each at a low setting. Samples were centrifuged to remove nuclei and mitochondria (10,000 × g for 15 s) and then at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the postmitochondrial membranes. To isolate lipid rafts from this fraction, a portion was resuspended in buffer with a non-ionic detergent (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA with protease and phosphatase inhibitors with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). Samples were solubilized on ice for 15 min, and detergent-insoluble material was pelleted (14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Detergent-insoluble pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the above buffer without Triton, sucrose was added to 40% (w/v), and the samples were placed on the bottom of 11-ml ultracentrifuge tubes. A 5–30% (w/v) continuous gradient of sucrose made up in the above buffer without Triton X-100 (total volume, 10 ml) was overlaid on top of the samples, and samples were centrifuged at 37,000 rpm in a swinging bucket rotor (TH641 Kendro, Newtown, CT) for 20 h at 4 °C. Half-milliliter fractions were collected, and initial experiments were performed to determine which fractions contained lipid rafts. Sucrose percentages of fractions were determined using intestinal brush border membranes as a source of sucrase and measuring the glucose generated in a colorimetric assay using glucose oxidase and o-dianisidine. Standard solutions of 40, 30, 20, 10, and 5% (w/v) sucrose were used as standards. Cholesterol was analyzed in all fractions by the procedure of Hilderson (25Hilderson H.E. Steen L. De Wolf M. Lagrou A. Hilderson H.J. Van Dessel G. Dierick W. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and was found to correlate with an increased absorbance at 600 nm. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, fractions were analyzed by absorbance, and appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off filter (Amicon, Milford, MA) to approximately one-fifth volume. Protein concentrations, whether in membranes or in concentrated raft fractions, were determined using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (26Smith P. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with 3× Laemmli stop solution, heated to 65 °C, and analyzed by Western blotting within 2 days. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE except for oligomerization experiments in which a 5% acrylamide concentration was used. Completed gels were immediately transferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membranes (Polyscreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 1× Towbin's buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.8, with 10% (v/v) methanol). Blots were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (T-TBS; 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.4, with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) for 60 min. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal antiserum directed against 17 amino acids of the amino terminus of isoform 1 of the skate anion exchangers (skAE1) characterized previously (27Koomoa D.-L.T. Musch M.W. Myers D.E. Goldstein L. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 198: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After primary antibody, blots were washed five times with T-TBS, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min, washed four times with T-TBS, washed once with TBS, and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (SuperSignal, Pierce). When blots were analyzed for phosphotyrosine, bovine serum albumin (3%, w/v) replaced the milk in the blocking solution. The 4G10 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was used. Other antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-flotillin-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Densitometry of all blots was performed using NIH Image version 1.54 software. Surface Biotinylation—To label proteins that may expose portions to the cell exterior, the cell-impermeant labeling agent sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) was used. Since biotin reacts with free amine groups (as the ϵ amino groups of lysine residues in proteins), all amines, including Tris and urea, were removed from the medium and replaced with HEPES and mannitol. Since mannitol is not generally used in our elasmobranch buffers, its effect on hypotonic stimulated taurine efflux was determined. Cells exposed to isotonic buffer with mannitol did not demonstrate increased basal taurine efflux, and hypotonic medium with mannitol did not alter the stimulated efflux (data not shown). The osmolarity of all buffers was confirmed using a vapor point osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT). To surface biotinylate, cells were exposed to medium compositions, pelleted, and chilled to 4 °C to minimize endocytosis and exocytosis. Because certain buffers contained reagents that might react with the biotin, e.g. ammonium chloride or diethyl urea, these samples were brought up in 4 °C 940 EIM without urea or Tris and surface-labeled. Oligomerization of skAE1—To determine the whether skAE1 had formed tetramers, the cross-linking agent BS3 was used on isolated membranes. Reactions used 5 mm BS3 for 60 min at 4 °C (Pierce). After cross-linking, reactions were stopped by the addition of Tris, and when appropriate, Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were isolated as above. In some cases, the detergent-insoluble fraction was further separated on the sucrose density gradients. To determine the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of skAE1 after cross-linking, skAE1 was immunoprecipitated from either total membranes, Triton-soluble and -insoluble material, or sucrose gradient fractions after addition of 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholic acid. One microgram of affinity-purified anti-skAE1 antibody was used for each immunoprecipitation, which followed standard protocols utilizing protein G-agarose. The immunoprecipitated skAE1 was eluted from the agarose and separated by 5% SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot was generated that was analyzed using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Statistcal Analysis—In those cases where statistical comparisons were made, either a paired Student's t test or an analysis of variance using a Bonferroni correction was performed using Instat software for the Mac (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Distribution of skAE1 upon Volume Expansion—The amount of skAE1 expressed on the surface of the cells as well as in the non-ionic detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions was first determined. To determine the amount of skAE1 in the external plasma membrane, cells were incubated in isoosmotic or hypoosmotic conditions in buffers modified so that no free amines were available for the surface biotinylation (replacing Tris with HEPES and urea with mannitol). Under isoosmotic conditions, a small percentage of cell skAE1 was labeled with the cell-impermeant biotin. However, the labeling increased significantly 10 min after hypotonic volume expansion (Fig. 1, top panels, second lanes, Surf). There was no change in the total cell skAE1 expression over this time (Fig. 1, top panels, first lanes, Total). Replacement of NaCl and mannitol with permeant solutes such as ethylene glycol, diethyl urea, or ammonium chloride also causes volume expansion. However, the kinetics of the response differs from hypoosmotic medium-stimulated volume expansion. Whereas hypoosmotic medium-stimulated volume expansion occurs within 5–15 min, volume expansion using permeant solutes in isoosmotic medium requires 30 min. Functionally little or no increase in efflux of the amino acid taurine occurs in permeant solute-stimulated volume expansion in contrast to hypotonic-stimulated volume expansion that stimulates taurine efflux in 5–15 min (14Wittels K.A. Musch M.W. Hubert E.M. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R69-R76Google Scholar). Volume expansion using isoosmotic media with permeant solutes did not result in the appearance of skAE1 on the surface (Fig. 1, bottom panels, second lanes). Therefore, the appearance of skAE1 on the surface was an effect unique to hypoosmotic medium-stimulated volume expansion. To determine how much of each pool, total and surface-expressed, was in detergent-insoluble regions, skAE1 was analyzed in membranes solubilized with the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100. This fraction was analyzed as total Triton-insoluble material or DRM. Under isoosmotic conditions, a significant percentage could be found in DRM (Fig. 1, top left panels, third lanes, DRM), and this increased slightly when isolated from hypoosmotic volume-expanded cells (Fig. 1, top right panel, third lane, DRM). No changes were noted in DRM from cells after 30 min in isoosmotic permeant solute volume-expanding media (Fig. 1, bottom panels, third lanes, DRM). To determine how much skAE1 in the DRM was surface-expressed, DRMs were isolated from cells that had been surface-labeled with biotin, and biotinylated DRM material was isolated with streptavidin. Although skAE1 was present in the DRM from cells in isoosmotic conditions, little of this material was biotinylated (Fig. 1, top left panel, fourth lane, DRM), suggesting that it resides in an intracellular compartment. Hypoosmotic but not isoosmotic permeant solute volume expansion increased skAE1 in DRM expressed on the surface (Fig. 1, top right and bottom three panels, fourth lane). Therefore, hypotonic stimulated volume expansion causes a pool of skAE1 in DRM to be placed on the cell surface. To more completely analyze the nature of skAE1 in DRM, skAE1 in DRM was separated on continuous sucrose density gradients. SkAE1 in the DRM may exist in a number of domains. Some DRM material may be in lipid raft regions that are buoyant due to their lipid nature. As shown in Fig. 2, skAE1 is found at both the bottom of the sucrose as well as a buoyant fraction near 20% sucrose in DRM from cells under isoosmotic and hypotonic conditions. The fractions were tested for cholesterol, and those fractions that contained the buoyant skAE1 contained cholesterol as opposed to neighboring fractions that contained little or no cholesterol. These fractions also had a higher cholesterol/protein ratio than the material at the bottom of the sucrose gradient (data not shown). As confirmation that these buoyant fractions of the sucrose gradients represented membrane lipid raft regions, fractions were also analyzed for two markers of lipid raft regions. Caveolin-1 has been demonstrated to be highly enriched in certain lipid rafts and may coordinate their structure. Additionally proteins of the band 7.2 family, such as flotillin and stomatin, have been noted to be enriched in these buoyant membrane lipid raft regions (28Samuel B.U. Mohandas N. Harrison T. McManus H. Rose W. Reid M. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29319-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, top panel, those fractions that contained skAE1 and possessed cholesterol also had both caveolin-1 and flotillin-2, further confirming that these fractions represented the membrane raft domains. The panels presented for caveolin-1 and flotillin-2 are from a sample of cells in hypoosmotic medium; however, similar patterns were observed when DRMs from cells in isoosmotic medium were analyzed (data not shown). To determine whether the material in the fractions was surface-expressed, skAE1 was isolated from the sucrose gradient fractions after biotinylation. Little biotinylated skAE1 could be isolated from the buoyant regions from DRM of cells in isoosmotic conditions, whereas biotinylated skAE1 could be isolated from this buoyant region from DRM after hypotonic volume expansion (Fig. 2, bottom panels). Oligomeric State of skAE1 in Membrane Fractions—One important event that may regulate the activity of skAE1 is its association to tetramers following hypotonic stimulated volume expansion (22Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21221-21225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Under isoosmotic conditions, skAE1 is found nearly in an equivalent distribution as monomers and dimers as compared with hypoosmotic conditions, which resulted in the formation of tetramers (Fig. 3A). No skAE1 tetramers could be found under isoosmotic conditions as expected, and the tetramer form could be detected in both Triton-soluble and -insoluble forms (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). To determine whether the tetramers were in the buoyant raft fractions of the detergent-insoluble membranes, this material was separated on sucrose gradients, and membranes from the bottom as well as the buoyant fractions were analyzed. SkAE1 tetramers could be detected in both buoyant raft fractions as well as in the membranes at the bottom of the gradient (Fig. 3C). Phosphotyrosine Levels of skAE1—Upon volume expansion, tyrosine phosphorylation of skAEs increases. We first analyzed phosphotyrosine of non-modified skAE1. In this case, skAE1 runs as a 97-kDa protein. SkAE1 was immunoprecipitated from isoosmotic and hypoosmotic cells as presented in Fig. 4, far left panel. While skAE1 is tyrosine phosphorylated under basal conditions, this increases ∼90% upon volume expansion. To determine the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of the lipid raft skAE1 and whether this increase was associated with the appearance in the plasma membrane, skAE1 was immunoprecipitated from both Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions after cross-linking. Under basal conditions, skAE1 in both the monomer and dimer is tyrosine phosphorylated, and this is true for skAE1 in both Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 4, A and B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of skAE1 tetramer increases under hypoosmotic conditions (Fig. 4A), and this may be found in both Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions, although the greater increase occurs in the Triton-insoluble fraction. In A, to determine that increased phosphotyrosine was observed when samples from BS3-cross-linked samples were used, blots were scanned, and the densitometric units of the monomer, dimer, and tetramer were summed. As shown Fig. 4A, below the right panel, increased phosphotyrosine levels were detected. The levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of the tetramers in the buoyant raft fraction as well as the denser material at the bottom fractions of the sucrose gradient were determined. In both fractions, skAE1 phosphorylated tetramers were detected (Fig. 4C). Effect of Cholesterol Depletion on Volume-expanded Stimulated Taurine Uptake—Volume expansion of skate erythrocytes results in a rapid loss of taurine. This increased permeability may also be measured as increased taurine uptake as the permeability is bidirectional (11Lewis R.A. Bursell J.D. Kirk K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Goldstein L. Brill S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1014-R1020PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cholesterol-rich lipid regions of the membrane were involved, erythrocytes were treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBCD) at 2.5 mm for 30 min in isoosmotic (940) EIM prior to taurine uptake measurement. MBCD was removed by washing cells in isoosmotic EIM once prior to initiation of uptake. Disruption of lipid raft regions was confirmed by analyzing samples of cells after 30 min in isoosmotic, hypoosmotic, or hypoosmotic conditions after treatment with MBCD by measuring the cholesterol content of all fractions of the detergent-resistant material placed on sucrose gradients. Protein concentrations of the fractions were also determined. Within 30 min, the appearance of fractions with cholesterol was decreased nearly 35%, and by 60 min, over half of the cholesterol of what would be predicted in the “peak” fractions (fractions 8 and 9) was decreased (2.61 ± 0.44 to 1.33 ± 0.27 μg/108 cells, n = 3). This decrease was also observed at the level of protein concentrations in these fractions (decreasing from 74.8 ± 12.2 to 41.1 ± 14.6 μg/108 cells, n = 3) using 2.5 mm MBCD. The amount of cholesterol in the non-buoyant fractions at the bottom of the sucrose gradient (fractions 19 and 20 corresponding to 40% (w/v) sucrose) also decreased, but the percentage of change was less (4.79 ± 0.96 to 3.96 ± 0.97 μg/108 cells) and protein values were 231 ± 16 and 249 ± 26 μg/108 cells, respectively (n = 3). Lower concentrations were effective but were more variable, and 5 mm MBCD had approximately the same effect as 2.5 mm MBCD. Treatment with 2.5 mm MBCD inhibited volume-expanded stimulation of taurine efflux by ∼50% at both 30 and 60 min (Fig. 5). Although not shown, MBCD had no effect on taurine uptake in 940 medium, suggesting that at least over this time and at this concentration, nonspecific permeability to taurine was not affected by MBCD. To determine the effect of MBCD on distribution of total and surface-expressed skAE1, skAE1 in DRMs and surface-expressed skAE1 in DRMs were analyzed as in Fig. 1. Samples were taken at 30 min after initiation of uptakes and, when appropriate, immediately chilled to 4 °C and biotinylated as previously described. Similar to results on taurine uptake, MBCD pretreatment partially inhibited the appearance of skAE1 on the surface and reduced the amount in the surface detergent-resistant membranes (Fig. 5). Regulation of membrane proteins, including transporters, occurs through a variety of processes. These may include phosphorylation, regulation by association with or attachment to membrane lipids, or association with adaptor and accessory proteins. All of these possibilities appear to occur for the skate homolog of band 3, the human red blood cell anion exchanger (29Passow H. Fasold H. Zaki L. Schulman B. Lepke S. Gardos G. Szasz I. Biomembranes: Structure and Function. 35. North Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975: 197-214Google Scholar). Past results suggest that skAE1 participates in a permeability formed when cell volume is expanded hypotonically, allowing for efflux of solutes such as taurine, β-alanine, myoinositol, and betaine (11Lewis R.A. Bursell J.D. Kirk K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Goldstein L. Brill S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R1014-R1020PubMed Google Scholar, 13Haynes J.K. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: R173-R179PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wittels K.A. Musch M.W. Hubert E.M. Goldstein L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: R69-R76Google Scholar). The present results suggest that one level of regulation of this activity may be due to exocytosis of skAE1 from an intracellular vesicular compartment, where it resides within lipid rafts, into the plasma membrane. A significant percentage of skAE1 is found in DRMs in all, even isoosmotic, conditions. However, little DRM skAE1 from cells in isoosmotic medium is expressed on the surface, but this increases with hypoosmotic stimulated volume expansion. We hypothesize that skAE1 in an intracellular pool in DRM is altered and undergoes exocytosis to reside in DRM in the surface membrane. SkAE1 in DRM under isoosmotic conditions as well as hypoosmotic stimulated volume-expanded conditions is in both buoyant as well as non-buoyant membranes (on a sucrose gradient). We cannot prove that exchange between skAE1 in these two regions, buoyant and non-buoyant material regions, does not occur, but the simplest hypothesis is that it is skAE1 in a buoyant DRM region that is intracellular and is stimulated to fuse with the plasma membrane and thus is surface-expressed skAE1 in buoyant fractions of the DRM. We cannot exclude movement of skAE1 from detergent-soluble to detergent-resistant as there is a small increase upon hypoosmotic stimulated volume expansion. If this is the case, we believe that it accounts for only a small percentage of the increased surface skAE1 in buoyant material of the DRM. SkAE1 in the detergent-resistant regions is tyrosine phosphorylated, and this increases upon hypoosmotic stimulated volume expansion. This may be due to the tyrosine kinase p72syk, which we have previously demonstrated is stimulated by hypotonic volume expansion (21Musch M.W. Hubert E. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally skAE1 in the lipid raft fractions that face outside the cell forms tetrameric complexes. The role of specific membrane domains in cell signaling has received considerable attention over the past decade (30Edidin M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 32Chamberlin L.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Many proteins are preferentially directed to specific domains, and therefore functional events that require these proteins may only occur in these limited regions. The existence of lipid raft regions was first hypothesized by Simons and Ikonen (31Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar) to explain the sorting of specific proteins into sphingolipid regions of the apical and basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. Subsequent investigations have demonstrated heterogeneity in the buoyant membrane regions (32Chamberlin L.H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Edidin M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). We and others have used cholesterol-depleting agents to investigate this possibility. The lipid raft regions possess a high cholesterol/protein ratio, and their structure may be more easily disrupted than membrane domains with less cholesterol. Therefore, rapid inhibition of a functional response using cholesterol-binding agents such as methylcyclodextrins may provide an early clue that lipid rafts play a pivotal role in one step of the process. Therefore, the ability of cyclodextrin to inhibit taurine transport stimulated by volume expansion suggests that the lipid rafts of the plasma membrane are important in this functional response. Depending on the cell type, diverse proteins preferentially associate with the raft regions including immunologic receptors such as the T-cell receptor or Fcγ (34Zubiaur M. Fernandez O. Ferrero E. Salmeron J. Malissen B. Malavasi F. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Shao D. Segal A.W. Dekker L.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), hormone receptors (36Lamb M.E. Zhang C. Shea T. Kyle D.J. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14340-14347Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Bruses J.L. Chauvet N. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 504-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transporters such as sodium/hydrogen exchangers and a number of types of ion channels (38Li X. Galli T. Wade J. Weinman E.J. Leung G. Cheong A. Louvard D. Donowitz M. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Tillman T.S. Cascio M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 38: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In particular for the red blood cells, flotillin and stomatin as well are notably concentrated in the raft regions (28Samuel B.U. Mohandas N. Harrison T. McManus H. Rose W. Reid M. Haldar K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29319-29329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 40Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 41Salzer U. Prohaska R. Blood. 2001; 97: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the differential presence of these proteins in the lipid raft regions regulates their functions. A number of proteins in lipid raft regions may form oligomers similar to skAE1, e.g. the T-cell receptor and the IgE receptor. Oligomerization and complex formation may be important steps in subsequent cell activation. In the lipid raft regions, it is possible that skAE1 comes into proximity to tyrosine kinases and other regulators that alter the structure sufficiently to allow changes in function. We speculate that modification by phosphorylation and/or association with adaptor proteins may participate in the ability of skAE1 to affect permeability for taurine. Previous work has demonstrated decreased band 4.1 binding and increased ankyrin binding with skAEs upon hypotonic stimulated volume expansion (22Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21221-21225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Musch M.W. Goldstein L. J. Exp. Zool. 2001; 289: 179-183Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Additionally the level of tyrosine phosphorylation increases (present studies and Ref. 21Musch M.W. Hubert E. Goldstein L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7923-7928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the interaction of skAE1 with the cytoskeletal proteins and tyrosine kinases such as p72syk as well as the interaction of these proteins with membrane fractions under normal volume as well as expanded conditions is presently only partially understood. The activity of a number of transport proteins, carriers and channels, may be modulated by the membrane lipid environment in which the transporter resides. The human homolog of skAE1, erythrocyte band 3, may be expressed on renal intercalated cells. Band 3, AE1, may be expressed on the apical side of these cells; however, when plated on a specific extracellular matrix, the band 3 is expressed on the basolateral side (42Van'tHof W. Malik A. Vijayakumar S. Qiao J. Van Adelsberg J. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The basolateral membrane of these cells is rich in sphingolipids, while the apical membrane is ganglioside-rich. The hypothesis arose whether band 3 had differential function based on its lipid environment in the basolateral versus apical membrane. Artificial membranes were used mimicking the apical or basolateral membrane lipid composition, band 3 was added, and activities were measured. When inserted into the sphingolipid-rich membranes, band 3 possessed exchanger activity that was sensitive to stilbenes, while band 3 expressed in ganglioside-enriched membranes is less active and not inhibited by stilbenes. Thus, the membrane environment appears to regulate band 3 function. Activity of a different Cl– transport protein, the channel ICl, swell, is modulated by expression of caveolin-1b (43Trouet D. Nilius B. Jacobs A. Remacle C. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using cells that express ICl, swell but not caveolins, it was demonstrated that introduction of the caveolin isoform 1b (expressed on surface membranes) but not 1a (expressed on internal membranes) increases the activity of ICl, swell. ICl, swell appeared to associate with the newly formed caveolin-1b-generated lipid rafts, thereby increasing its function. In conclusion, hypoosmotically induced volume expansion stimulates the appearance of skAE1 on the plasma membrane of skate erythrocytes. A large percentage of the surface-expressed skAE1 is in buoyant regions of the plasma membrane. This skAE1 appears to be initially in an intracellular membrane compartment where it also resides in these buoyant membrane regions. Future work will determine whether the “exocytosis” of skAE1, which occurs under hypoosmotic stimulated but not volume expansion by permeant solutes, may be regulated by phosphorylation of skAE1 or potentially cytoskeletal interactions that may also be altered during this time."
