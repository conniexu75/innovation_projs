https://openalex.org/W2782593519,"RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) assemble together on different promoter types to initiate the transcription of small, structured RNAs. Here we present structures of Pol III preinitiation complexes, comprising the 17-subunit Pol III and the heterotrimeric transcription factor TFIIIB, bound to a natural promoter in different functional states. Electron cryo-microscopy reconstructions, varying from 3.7 Å to 5.5 Å resolution, include two early intermediates in which the DNA duplex is closed, an open DNA complex, and an initially transcribing complex with RNA in the active site. Our structures reveal an extremely tight, multivalent interaction between TFIIIB and promoter DNA, and explain how TFIIIB recruits Pol III. Together, TFIIIB and Pol III subunit C37 activate the intrinsic transcription factor-like activity of the Pol III-specific heterotrimer to initiate the melting of double-stranded DNA, in a mechanism similar to that of the Pol II system."
https://openalex.org/W2783965340,"A lack of effective treatment is one of the main factors contributing to gastric cancer–related death. Discovering effective targets and understanding their underlying anti-cancer mechanism are key to achieving the best response to treatment and to limiting side effects. Although recent studies have shown that the cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is crucial for cancer cell survival, the exact mechanism remains unclear, limiting its therapeutic potential. Here, using molecular and functional assays, we investigated the role of TRPM2 in survival of gastric cancer cells. Our results indicated that TRPM2 knockdown in AGS and MKN-45 cells decreases cell proliferation and enhances apoptosis. We also observed that the TRPM2 knockdown impairs mitochondrial metabolism, indicated by a decrease in basal and maximal mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and ATP production. These mitochondrial defects coincided with a decrease in autophagy and mitophagy, indicated by reduced levels of autophagy- and mitophagy-associated proteins (i.e. ATGs, LC3A/B II, and BNIP3). Moreover, we found that TRPM2 modulates autophagy through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent and mechanistic target of rapamycin-independent pathway. We conclude that in the absence of TRPM2, down-regulation of the JNK-signaling pathway impairs autophagy, ultimately causing the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and death of gastric cancer cells. Of note, by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, the TRPM2 down-regulation enhanced the efficacy of paclitaxel and doxorubicin in gastric cancer cells. Collectively, we provide compelling evidence that TRPM2 inhibition may benefit therapeutic approaches for managing gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2783056337,"Introduction In conventional MR examinations glioblastomas multiforme (GBMs), metastases and primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSLs) may show very similar appearance. The aim of the study was to evaluate usefulness of multiparametric T2*DSC perfusion and diffusion MR imaging in the preoperative differentiation of these tumors. Material and methods Seventy four solitary enhancing tumors (27 GBMs, 30 metastases, 17 PCNSLs) were enrolled in the study. Parameters of cerebral blood volume (rCBV), peak height (rPH), percentage of signal recovery (rPSR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were assessed from the tumor core and the peritumoral non-enhancing T2-hyperintense zone. Results Within the tumor core there were no differences in perfusion and diffusion parameters between GBMs and metastases. Compared to GBMs and metastases, PCNSLs showed significantly lower rCBV and rPH, ADC as well as higher rPSR values. Max rCBV with a cut-off value of 2.18 demonstrated the highest accuracy of 0.98 in differentiating PCNSLs from other tumors. To distinguish GBMs from metastases analysis of the peritumoral zone was performed showing significantly higher rCBV, rPH and lower ADC values in GBMs with the highest accuracy of 0.94 found for max rCBV at a cut-off value of 0.98. Conclusions Max rCBV seems to be the most important parameter to differentiate GBMs, metastases and PCNSLs. Analysis of max rCBV within the tumor core enables to distinguish hypoperfused PCNSLs from hyperperfused GBMs and metastases while evaluation of max rCBV within the peritumoral zone is helpful to distinguish GBMs showing peritumoral infiltration from metastases surrounded by pure edema."
https://openalex.org/W2783037283,"Emerging notion in carcinogenesis ascribes tumor initiation and aggressiveness to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Specifically, colorectal cancer (CRC) development was shown to be compatible with CSCs hypothesis. Mutations in p53 are highly frequent in CRC, and are known to facilitate tumor development and aggressiveness. Yet, the link between mutant p53 and colorectal CSCs is not well-established. In the present study, we set to examine whether oncogenic mutant p53 proteins may augment colorectal CSCs phenotype. By genetic manipulation of mutant p53 in several cellular systems, we demonstrated that mutant p53 enhances colorectal tumorigenesis. Moreover, mutant p53-expressing cell lines harbor larger sub-populations of cells highly expressing the known colorectal CSCs markers: CD44, Lgr5, and ALDH. This elevated expression is mediated by mutant p53 binding to CD44, Lgr5, and ALDH1A1 promoter sequences. Furthermore, ALDH1 was found to be involved in mutant p53-dependent chemotherapy resistance. Finally, analysis of ALDH1 and CD44 in human CRC biopsies indicated a positive correlation between their expression and the presence of oncogenic p53 missense mutations. These findings suggest novel insights pertaining the mechanism by which mutant p53 enhances CRC development, which involves the expansion of CSCs sub-populations within CRC tumors, and underscore the importance of targeting these sub-populations for CRC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2783038028,"Acetaminophen or paracetamol (APAP) overdose is a common cause of liver injury. Silymarin (SLM) is a hepatoprotective agent widely used for treating liver injury of different origin. In order to evaluate the possible beneficial effects of SLM, Balb/c mice were pretreated with SLM (100 mg/kg b.wt. per os) once daily for three days. Two hours after the last SLM dose, the mice were administered APAP (300 mg/kg b.wt. i.p.) and killed 6 (T6), 12 (T12) and 24 (T24) hours later. SLM-treated mice exhibited a significant reduction in APAP-induced liver injury, assessed according to AST and ALT release and histological examination. SLM treatment significantly reduced superoxide production, as indicated by lower GSSG content, lower HO-1 induction, alleviated nitrosative stress, decreased p-JNK activation and direct measurement of mitochondrial superoxide production in vitro. SLM did not affect the APAP-induced decrease in CYP2E1 activity and expression during the first 12 hrs. Neutrophil infiltration and enhanced expression of inflammatory markers were first detected at T12 in both groups. Inflammation progressed in the APAP group at T24 but became attenuated in SLM-treated animals. Histological examination suggests that necrosis the dominant cell death pathway in APAP intoxication, which is partially preventable by SLM pretreatment. We demonstrate that SLM significantly protects against APAP-induced liver damage through the scavenger activity of SLM and the reduction of superoxide and peroxynitrite content. Neutrophil-induced damage is probably secondary to necrosis development."

However, the expression levels and prognostic significance of translation elongation factors remain poorly explored in different cancers. In this study, we have investigated the mRNA transcript levels of seven translation elongation factors in different cancer types using Oncomine and TCGA databases. Furthermore, we have identified the prognostic significance of these factors using Kaplan-Meier Plotter and SurvExpress databases. We observed altered expression levels of all the elongation factors in different cancers. Higher expression of EEF1A2, EEF1B2, EEF1G, EEF1D, EEF1E1 and EEF2 was observed in most of the cancer types, whereas reverse trend was observed for EEF1A1. Overexpression of many factors predicted poor prognosis in breast (EEF1D, EEF1E1, EEF2) and lung cancer (EEF1A2, EEF1B2, EEF1G, EEF1E1). However, we didn’t see any common correlation of expression levels of elongation factors with survival outcomes across cancer types. Cancer subtype stratification showed association of survival outcomes and expression levels of elongation factors in specific sub-types of breast, lung and gastric cancer. Most interestingly, we observed a reciprocal relationship between the expression levels of the two EEF1A isoforms viz. EEF1A1 and EEF1A2, in most of the cancer types. Our results suggest that translation elongation factors can have a role in tumorigenesis and affect survival in cancer specific manner. Elongation factors have potential to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic drug targets, yet further study is required. Reciprocal relationship of differential expression between EEF1A isoforms observed in multiple cancer types indicates opposing roles in cancer and needs further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2783547504,"Objective Up to 30% of obese individuals are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are characterized by having low abdominal adiposity, low inflammation level and low risk of developing metabolic comorbidity. In this study, we hypothesize that cardiorespiratory fitness (fitness) is a determinant factor for the MHO individuals and aim to investigate the associations between fitness, abdominal adiposity and low-grade inflammation within different BMI categories. Method Data from 10,976 individuals from the general population, DANHES 2007–2008, on waist circumference, fitness and C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were analysed using multiple linear and median quantile regressions. Results In men, an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and waist circumference (-1.45 cm; 95% CI: -1.55 to -1.35 cm; p<0.001), and an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and hsCRP (-0.22 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.255 to -0.185 mg/L; p<0.001) was found, all independent of BMI. Similarly in women, an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and waist circumference (-1.15 cm; 95% CI: -1.25 to -1.0 cm; p<0.001), and an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and hsCRP (-0.26 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.3 to -0.22 mg/L; p<0.001) was found, all independent of BMI. Additionally, significant positive associations between waist circumference and hsCRP were found for both men and women, independently of BMI. Conclusion Fitness was found to be inversely associated with both abdominal adiposity and low-grade inflammation independent of BMI. These data suggest that, in spite of BMI, high fitness levels lead to a reduction in abdominal fat mass and low-grade inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2952993450,"The environment can influence heterosis, the phenomena in which the offspring of two inbred parents exhibits phenotypic performance beyond the inbred parents for specific traits. In this study we measured 25 traits in a set of 47 maize hybrids and their inbred parents grown in 16 different environments with varying levels of average productivity. By quantifying 25 vegetative and reproductive traits across the life cycle we were able to analyze interactions between the environment and multiple distinct instances of heterosis. The magnitude and rank among hybrids for better-parent heterosis (BPH) varied for the different traits and environments. Across the traits, a higher within plot variance was observed for inbred lines compared to hybrids. However, for most traits, variance across environments was not significantly different for inbred lines compared to hybrids. Further, for many traits the correlations of BPH to hybrid performance and BPH to better parent performance were of comparable magnitude. These results indicate that inbred lines and hybrids show similar trends in environmental response and both are contributing to observed genotype-by-environment interactions for heterosis. This study highlights the degree of heterosis is not an inherent trait of a specific hybrid, but varies depending on the trait measured and the environment where that trait is measured. Studies that attempt to correlate molecular processes with heterosis are hindered by the fact that heterosis is not a consistent attribute of a specific hybrid."
https://openalex.org/W2783955862,"The bacterial cell wall is an important and highly complex structure that is essential for bacterial growth because it protects bacteria from cell lysis and environmental insults. A typical Gram-positive bacterial cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan and the secondary cell wall polymers, wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). In many Gram-positive bacteria, LTA is a polyglycerol-phosphate chain that is decorated with d-alanine and sugar residues. However, the function of and proteins responsible for the glycosylation of LTA are either unknown or not well-characterized. Here, using bioinformatics, genetic, and NMR spectroscopy approaches, we found that the Bacillus subtilis csbB and yfhO genes are essential for LTA glycosylation. Interestingly, the Listeria monocytogenes gene lmo1079, which encodes a YfhO homolog, was not required for LTA glycosylation, but instead was essential for WTA glycosylation. LTA is polymerized on the outside of the cell and hence can only be glycosylated extracellularly. Based on the similarity of the genes coding for YfhO homologs that are required in B. subtilis for LTA glycosylation or in L. monocytogenes for WTA glycosylation, we hypothesize that WTA glycosylation might also occur extracellularly in Listeria species. Finally, we discovered that in L. monocytogenes, lmo0626 (gtlB) was required for LTA glycosylation, indicating that the encoded protein has a function similar to that of YfhO, although the proteins are not homologous. Together, our results enable us to propose an updated model for LTA glycosylation and also indicate that glycosylation of WTA might occur through two different mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria.

The bacterial cell wall is a highly complex and very important structure; it maintains the cell shape and protects bacteria from cell lysis and environmental insults. The main cell wall components present in Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, are peptidoglycan and teichoic acids.

According to this model, a cytoplasmic glycosyltransferase (GT) uses a nucleotide-activated sugar to form a C55-P sugar intermediate, which is subsequently transported across the membrane by a flippase enzyme. The sugar molecule is subsequently transferred onto LTA by the action of a second GT (27Yokoyama K. Araki Y. Ito E.

As the polyglycerol-phosphate backbone of LTA is polymerized on the outside of the cell, this final step needs to be catalyzed by a GT with an extracellular active site. Recently, GtlA (locus tag Lmo0933 in strain EGD-e) has been identified as the putative cytoplasmic GT involved in the glycosylation process of LTA in the L. monocytogenes strain 10403S (29Percy M.G.

This protein is anchored by two C-terminal transmembrane helices to the membrane and contains a large N-terminal cytoplasmic enzymatic domain. NMR analysis of LTA produced by a gtlA mutant strain confirmed the absence of galactose modifications. Additionally, cell extracts obtained from the gtlA mutant strain showed a stronger LTA signal on western blots using a polyglycerol phosphate–specific antibody as compared with a WT strain, suggesting that the LTA backbone structure is better recognized by the antibody in the absence of sugar modifications (29Percy M.G.

GtlA belongs to the GT2 family of glycosyltransferases and is characterized by a GT-A fold. GT-A fold glycosyltransferases assume a Rossmann fold with seven or more β-sheets, which is typical for proteins that bind nucleotides (30Rao S.T. Rossmann M.G. Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins.J. Mol.

A second feature of enzymes with a GT-A fold is the presence of a conserved DXD motif, which interacts with the phosphate group of the nucleotide-activated sugar.

However, the remaining proteins required for the glycosylation of LTA in L. monocytogenes are still unknown. Also, none of the enzymes involved in the LTA glycosylation process of B. subtilis, including the enzyme required for the production of the C55-P sugar intermediate, the enzyme required for the transfer of this intermediate from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane, or the enzyme that transfers the sugar residue to the polyglycerol backbone, have been identified. Here, we show that deletion of the csbB and yfhO genes in B. subtilis led to a loss of sugar modifications on LTA. Interestingly, the L. monocytogenes YfhO homolog, Lmo1079, is not involved in LTA but WTA glycosylation. Instead, we found that the absence of Lmo0626 (here renamed GtlB) has an impact on LTA glycosylation, and we hypothesize that this protein performs the extracellular LTA glycosylation step in L. monocytogenes. With this, not only did we discover additional genes required for LTA glycosylation, but the work also allowed us to propose an alternative, extracellular, glycosylation mechanism for wall teichoic acid. We have recently reported that the annotated glycosyltransferase GtlA probably catalyzes the first step of the LTA glycosylation process in L. monocytogenes (29Percy M.G. Karinou E. Webb A.J.

However, the enzymes involved in this process in other bacteria, including B. subtilis, remain unknown. To identify proteins required for LTA glycosylation in B. subtilis, the L. monocytogenes GtlA protein sequence was used as a query sequence in a BLASTP search against the B. subtilis 168 genome. This identified three homologs, YkcC (e-value: 1e−158), CsbB (e-value: 5e−68), and YkoT (e-value: 1e−60), all of which are encoded in a two-gene operon (Fig. 1A).

To assess whether YkcC, CsbB, and YkoT are involved in the LTA glycosylation process in B. subtilis, ykcC, csbB, and ykoT deletion strains were constructed by replacing the respective gene in B. subtilis 168 with an antibiotic resistance marker. To determine whether deletion of one of these genes impacts LTA synthesis, anti-LTA western blot analysis was performed on cell extracts derived from the WT and mutant B. subtilis strains. The LTA isolated from strain 168ΔcsbB yielded a stronger signal as compared with the WT strain (Fig. 1B), indicating that the structure or the amount of the LTA polymer is changed in the absence of CsbB. In contrast, the anti-LTA signal for strains with a ykcC or ykoT deletion was indistinguishable from that seen for the WT (Fig. 1B). To determine the chemical structure of LTA in the WT and mutant strains, the polymer was isolated and analyzed by 1D 1H NMR. LTA purified from WT B. subtilis 168 showed the expected spectrum; peaks derived from the CH2 groups of the GroP backbone (colored green in Fig. 2A), the CH2 and CH3 groups of the fatty acid chain (colored orange in Fig. 2A), the non-exchangeable protons from the d-Ala substitutions (colored blue in Fig. 2A), and the GlcNAc modification (colored yellow in Fig. 2A) could be assigned, as described previously (29Percy M.G.

The spectra, including the peaks for the nonexchangeable protons derived from the GlcNAc residues, were essentially identical for the LTA isolated from the ykcC and ykoT deletion strains to that of the WT strain, indicating that the proteins encoded by these two genes are not involved in the LTA glycosylation process in B. subtilis under the conditions used (Fig. S1). In contrast, the GlcNAc-specific peaks were absent in the NMR spectra obtained from the LTA isolated from the csbB mutant (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the phenotype is due to inactivation of csbB, a copy of csbB expressed from its native promoter was introduced into the amyE locus of the csbB mutant. The LTA western blot signal (Fig. 1B) and NMR peaks corresponding to GlcNAc (Fig. 2C) were restored to WT levels in the complementation strain.

We evaluated the salinity tolerance of a panel of 235 temperate japonica rice accessions genotyped with 30,000 SNP markers. The panel was exposed to mild salt stress (50 mM NaCl; conductivity of 6 dS m-1) at the seedling stage. Eight different root and shoot growth parameters were measured for both the control and stressed treatments. The Na+ and K+ mass fractions of the stressed plants were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The salt treatment affected plant growth, particularly the shoot parameters. The panel showed a wide range of Na+/K+ ratio and the temperate accessions were distributed over an increasing axis, from the most resistant to the most susceptible checks. We conducted a genome-wide association study on indices of stress response and ion mass fractions in the leaves using a classical mixed model controlling structure and kinship. A total of 27 QTLs validated by sub-sampling were identified. For indices of stress responses, we also used another model that focused on marker × treatment interactions and detected 50 QTLs, three of which were also identified using the classical method. We compared the positions of the significant QTLs to those of approximately 300 genes that play a role in rice salt tolerance. The positions of several QTLs were close to those of genes involved in calcium signaling and metabolism, while other QTLs were close to those of kinases. These results reveal the salinity tolerance of accessions with a temperate japonica background. Although the detected QTLs must be confirmed by other approaches, the number of associations linked to candidate genes involved in calcium-mediated ion homeostasis highlights pathways to explore in priority to understand the salinity tolerance of temperate rice."
https://openalex.org/W2783718453,"Poorly differentiated colorectal cancers (CRCs) are more aggressive and lack targeted therapies. We and others previously reported the predominant role of tumor-suppressor NDRG2 in promoting CRC differentiation, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that NDRG2 induction of CRC cell differentiation is dependent on the repression of E3 ligase Skp2 activity. In patients and Ndrg2 knockout mice, NDRG2 and Skp2 are negatively correlated and associated with cell differentiation stage. Further, NDRG2 suppression of Skp2 contributes to the inductions and stabilizations of p21 and p27, which are Skp2 target proteins for degradation. The reduction of either p21 or p27 levels by shRNA can decrease NDRG2-induced AKP activity and resume cell growth inhibition, thus both p21 and p27 are required for NDRG2 effect on the promotion of cell differentiation in CRCs. The mechanistic study shows that NDRG2 suppresses β-catenin nuclear translocation and decreases the occupancy of β-catenin/TCF complex on Skp2 promoter, potentially through dephosphorylating GSK-3β. By subjecting a series of NDRG2 deletion mutants to Skp2 expression, the loss of NH2-terminal domain can completely abolish NDRG2-dependent differentiation induction. Supporting the biological significance of the reciprocal relationship between NDRG2 and Skp2, an NDRG2low/Skp2high gene expression signature correlates with poor CRC patient outcome and could be considered as a diagnostic marker of CRCs."

Current evidence about the association between air pollution exposure and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the association between area-level ambient air pollution and self-reported DM in a large population sample in Italy. Materials and methods We extracted information about self-reported and physician diagnosed DM, risk factors and socio-economic status from 12 surveys conducted nationwide between 1999 and 2013. We obtained annual averaged air pollution levels for the years 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2010 from the AMS-MINNI national integrated model, which simulates the dispersion and transformation of pollutants. The original maps, with a resolution of 4 x 4 km2, were normalized and aggregated at the municipality class of each Italian region, in order to match the survey data. We fit logistic regression models with a hierarchical structure to estimate the relationship between PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and O3 four-years mean levels and the risk of being affected by DM. Results We included 376,157 individuals aged more than 45 years. There were 39,969 cases of DM, with an average regional prevalence of 9.8% and a positive geographical North-to-South gradient, opposite to that of pollutants’ concentrations. For each 10 μg/m3 increase, the resulting ORs were 1.04 (95% CI 1.01–1.07) for PM10, 1.04 (95% CI 1.02–1.07) for PM2.5, 1.03 (95% CI 1.01–1.05) for NO2 and 1.06 (95% CI 1.01–1.11) for O3, after accounting for relevant individual risk factors. The associations were robust to adjustment for other pollutants in two-pollutant models tested (ozone plus each other pollutant). Conclusions We observed a significant positive association between each examined pollutant and prevalent DM. Risk estimates were consistent with current evidence, and robust to sensitivity analysis. Our study adds evidence about the effects of air pollution on diabetes and suggests a possible role of ozone as an independent factor associated with the development of DM. Such relationship is of great interest for public health and deserves further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2785382193,"Trichoplax adhaerens has only six cell types. The function as well as the structure of crystal cells, the least numerous cell type, presented an enigma. Crystal cells are arrayed around the perimeter of the animal and each contains a birefringent crystal. Crystal cells resemble lithocytes in other animals so we looked for evidence they are gravity sensors. Confocal microscopy showed that their cup-shaped nuclei are oriented toward the edge of the animal, and that the crystal shifts downward under the influence of gravity. Some animals spontaneously lack crystal cells and these animals behaved differently upon being tilted vertically than animals with a typical number of crystal cells. EM revealed crystal cell contacts with fiber cells and epithelial cells but these contacts lacked features of synapses. EM spectroscopic analyses showed that crystals consist of the aragonite form of calcium carbonate. We thus provide behavioral evidence that Trichoplax are able to sense gravity, and that crystal cells are likely to be their gravity receptors. Moreover, because placozoans are thought to have evolved during Ediacaran or Cryogenian eras associated with aragonite seas, and their crystals are made of aragonite, they may have acquired gravity sensors during this early era."
https://openalex.org/W2782665087,"Background Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are typically asymptomatic and undetected except for incidental discovery on imaging. Blood-based diagnostic biomarkers could lead to improvements in IA management. This exploratory study examined circulating neutrophils to determine whether they carry RNA expression signatures of IAs. Methods Blood samples were collected from patients receiving cerebral angiography. Eleven samples were collected from patients with IAs and 11 from patients without IAs as controls. Samples from the two groups were paired based on demographics and comorbidities. RNA was extracted from isolated neutrophils and subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing to obtain differential expressions for identification of an IA-associated signature. Bioinformatics analyses, including gene set enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, were used to investigate the biological function of all differentially expressed transcripts. Results Transcriptome profiling identified 258 differentially expressed transcripts in patients with and without IAs. Expression differences were consistent with peripheral neutrophil activation. An IA-associated RNA expression signature was identified in 82 transcripts (p<0.05, fold-change ≥2). This signature was able to separate patients with and without IAs on hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, in an independent, unpaired, replication cohort of patients with IAs (n = 5) and controls (n = 5), the 82 transcripts separated 9 of 10 patients into their respective groups. Conclusion Preliminary findings show that RNA expression from circulating neutrophils carries an IA-associated signature. These findings highlight a potential to use predictive biomarkers from peripheral blood samples to identify patients with IAs."
https://openalex.org/W2783919717,"Lysosome function is essential in cellular homeostasis. In addition to its recycling role, the lysosome has recently been recognized as a cellular signaling hub. We have shown in mammary epithelial cells, both in vivo and in vitro, that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) modulates lysosome biogenesis and can promote the release of lysosomal proteases that culminates in cell death. To further investigate the impact of Stat3 on lysosomal function, we conducted a proteomic screen of changes in lysosomal membrane protein components induced by Stat3 using an iron nanoparticle enrichment strategy. Our results show that Stat3 activation not only elevates the levels of known membrane proteins but results in the appearance of unexpected factors, including cell surface proteins such as annexins and flotillins. These data suggest that Stat3 may coordinately regulate endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and lysosome biogenesis to drive lysosome-mediated cell death in mammary epithelial cells. The methodologies described in this study also provide significant improvements to current techniques used for the purification and analysis of the lysosomal proteome."

Many vegetation indices (VIs) and fluorescence parameters have been developed to estimate LNC. However, the comparison among VIs and between fluorescence parameters and VIs has been rarely studied in the estimation of LNC. In this study, the performances of several published empirical VIs and fluorescence parameters for the estimation of paddy rice LNC were analyzed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Then, the optimal VIs (TVI, MTVI1, MTVI2, and MSAVI) and fluorescence parameters (F735/F460 and F685/F460), which were suitable for LNC monitoring in this study, were chosen. In addition, the combination of the VIs and fluorescence parameters was proposed as the input variables in the SVM model and used to estimate the LNC. Experimental results exhibited the promising potential of the LIF technology combined with reflectance for the accurate estimation of LNC, which provided guidance for monitoring the LNC."
https://openalex.org/W2791844482,"Background The aim of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship of metformin on glucose levels after the administration of 250 mg and 1000 mg of metformin in healthy volunteers. Methods A total of 20 healthy male volunteers were randomized to receive two doses of either a low dose (375 mg followed by 250 mg) or a high dose (1000 mg followed by 1000 mg) of metformin at 12-h intervals. The pharmacodynamics of metformin was assessed using oral glucose tolerance tests before and after metformin administration. The PK parameters after the second dose were evaluated through noncompartmental analyses. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms in MATE1, MATE2-K, and OCT2 were genotyped, and their effects on PK characteristics were additionally evaluated. Results The plasma exposure of metformin increased as the metformin dose increased. The mean values for the area under the concentration-time curve from dosing to 12 hours post-dose (AUC0-12h) were 3160.4 and 8808.2 h·μg/L for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively. Non-linear relationships were found between the glucose-lowering effect and PK parameters with a significant inverse trend at high metformin exposure. The PK parameters were comparable among subjects with the genetic polymorphisms. Conclusions This study showed a non-linear PK-PD relationship on plasma glucose levels after the administration of metformin. The inverse relationship between systemic exposure and the glucose-lowering effect at a high exposure indicates a possible role for the intestines as an action site for metformin.

Patients with normal-range proteinuria had a significantly lower risk for CKD progression (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.38) than those with abnormal-proteinuria by multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. We also analyzed patients with normal-range proteinuria (n = 351). Nephrosclerosis was the most frequent cause of CKD among all patients with normal-range proteinuria (59.7%). During a median follow-up of 36 months, CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality were observed in 10, 28, and 18 patients, respectively. The Kaplan-Meyer analysis demonstrated that the risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events were not significantly different among CKD stages, whereas the risk of death was significantly higher in patients with advanced-stage CKD. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the risk of three endpoints did not significantly differ among CKD stages.Newly visiting CKD patients with normal-range proteinuria, who tend to be overlooked during health checkups did not exhibit a decrease in kidney function even in advanced CKD stages under specialized nephrology care."
https://openalex.org/W2783097434,"Bullying involvement is prevalent among children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined the effects of theory of mind performance training (ToMPT) on reducing bullying involvement in children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD. Children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD completed ToMPT (n = 26) and social skills training (SST; n = 23) programs. Participants in both groups and their mothers rated the pretraining and posttraining bullying involvement of participants on the Chinese version of the School Bullying Experience Questionnaire. The paired t test was used to evaluate changes in bullying victimization and perpetration between the pretraining and posttraining assessments. Furthermore, the linear mixed-effect model was used to examine the difference in the training effect between the ToMPT and SST groups. The paired t test indicated that in the ToMPT group, the severities of both self-reported (p = .039) and mother-reported (p = .003) bullying victimization significantly decreased from the pretraining to posttraining assessments, whereas in the SST group, only self-reported bullying victimization significantly decreased (p = .027). The linear mixed-effect model indicated that compared with the SST program, the ToMPT program significantly reduced the severity of mother-reported bullying victimization (p = .041). The present study supports the effects of ToMPT on reducing mother-reported bullying victimization in children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2783842241,"The incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is a serious threat to public health. Progress in developing new therapeutics is being outpaced by antibiotic resistance development, and alternative agents that rapidly permeabilize bacteria hold tremendous potential for treating MDR infections. A new class of glycopolymers includes polycationic poly-N (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG) is under development as an alternative to traditional antibiotic strategies to treat MRSA infections. This study demonstrates the antibacterial activity of PAAG against clinical isolates of methicillin and mupirocin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus was rapidly killed by PAAG, which completely eradicated 88% (15/17) of all tested strains (6-log reduction in CFU) in ≤ 12-hours at doses that are non-toxic to mammalian cells. PAAG also sensitized all the clinical MRSA strains (17/17) to oxacillin as demonstrated by the observed reduction in the oxacillin MIC to below the antibiotic resistance breakpoint. The effect of PAAG and standard antibiotics including vancomycin, oxacillin, mupirocin and bacitracin on MRSA permeability was studied by measuring propidium iodide (PI) uptake by bacterial cells. Antimicrobial resistance studies showed that S. aureus developed resistance to PAAG at a rate slower than to mupirocin but similar to bacitracin. PAAG was observed to resensitize drug-resistant S. aureus strains sampled from passage 13 and 20 of the multi-passage resistance study, reducing MICs of mupirocin and bacitracin below their clinical sensitivity breakpoints. This class of bacterial permeabilizing glycopolymers may provide a new tool in the battle against multidrug-resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2790641085,"Mechano-electric feedback affects the electrophysiological and mechanical function of the heart and the cellular, tissue, and organ properties. To determine the main factors that contribute to this effect, this study investigated the changes in the action potential characteristics of the ventricle during contraction. A model of stretch-activated channels was incorporated into a three-dimensional multiscale model of the contracting ventricle to assess the effect of different preload lengths on the electrophysiological behavior. The model describes the initiation and propagation of the electrical impulse, as well as the passive (stretch) and active (contraction) changes in the cardiac mechanics. Simulations were performed to quantify the relationship between the cellular activation and recovery patterns as well as the action potential durations at different preload lengths in normal and heart failure pathological conditions. The simulation results showed that heart failure significantly affected the excitation propagation parameters compared to normal condition. The results showed that the mechano-electrical feedback effects appear to be most important in failing hearts with low ejection fraction."
https://openalex.org/W2949811456,"Current treatments for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)—an aggressive form of brain cancer—are minimally effective and yield a median survival of 14.6 months and a two-year survival rate of 30%. Given the severity of GBM and the limitations of its treatment, there is a need for the discovery of novel drug targets for GBM and more personalized treatment approaches based on the characteristics of an individual’s tumor. Most receptor tyrosine kinases—such as EGFR—act as oncogenes, but publicly available data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) indicates copy number loss in the ERBB4 RTK gene across dozens of GBM cell lines, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. This loss is mutually exclusive with loss of its cognate ligand NRG1 in CCLE as well, more strongly suggesting a functional role. The availability of higher resolution copy number data from clinical GBM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that a region in Intron 1 of the ERBB4 gene was deleted in 69.1% of tumor samples harboring ERBB4 copy number loss; however, it was also found to be deleted in the matched normal tissue samples from these GBM patients (n = 81). Using the DECIPHER Genome Browser, we also discovered that this mutation occurs at approximately the same frequency in the general population as it does in the disease population. We conclude from these results that this loss in Intron 1 of the ERBB4 gene is neither a de novo driver mutation nor a predisposing factor to GBM, despite the indications from CCLE. A biological role of this significantly occurring genetic alteration is still unknown. While this is a negative result, the broader conclusion is that while copy number data from large cell line-based data repositories may yield compelling hypotheses, careful follow up with higher resolution copy number assays, patient data, and general population analyses are essential to codify initial hypotheses prior to investing experimental resources."
https://openalex.org/W2784173780,"The posterior visual pathway is commonly affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology that results in measurable clinical and electrophysiological impairment. Due to its highly structured retinotopic mapping, the visual pathway represents an ideal substrate for investigating patho-mechanisms in MS. Therefore, a reliable and robust imaging segmentation method for in-vivo delineation of the optic radiations (OR) is needed. However, diffusion-based tractography approaches, which are typically used for OR segmentation are confounded by the presence of focal white matter lesions. Current solutions require complex acquisition paradigms and demand expert image analysis, limiting application in both clinical trials and clinical practice. In the current study, using data acquired in a clinical setting on a 3T scanner, we optimised and compared two approaches for optic radiation (OR) reconstruction: individual probabilistic tractography-based and template-based methods. OR segmentation results were applied to subjects with MS and volumetric and diffusivity parameters were compared between OR segmentation techniques. Despite differences in reconstructed OR volumes, both OR lesion volume and OR diffusivity measurements in MS subjects were highly comparable using optimised probabilistic tractography-based, and template-based, methods. The choice of OR reconstruction technique should be determined primarily by the research question and the nature of the available dataset. Template-based approaches are particularly suited to the semi-automated analysis of large image datasets and have utility even in the absence of dMRI acquisitions. Individual tractography methods, while more complex than template based OR reconstruction, permit measurement of diffusivity changes along fibre bundles that are affected by specific MS lesions or other focal pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2790925314,"We investigated the stability and the directionality of being body bullied and a set of four variables- 1) Body Mass Index (BMI), 2) moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 3) television time (TV) and 4) video game/computer time (VG)-, termed in the present study as 'health-related state and behaviours (HRSB)'-across adolescence. The Adolescent Nutritional Assessment Longitudinal Study (ELANA) is a cohort study conducted among middle school students from two public and four private schools in Rio de Janeiro-Brazil. We analysed data from 2010 (T1) and 2012 (T2) among 810 adolescents (aged 9-15 at T1). Gender-specific structural equation models (SEM) were estimated, including autoregressive paths for the HRSB and being body bullied over time, correlations at T1 and T2, respectively, and cross-lagged effects. The results presented significant stability coefficients for almost all variables over time in both genders (except for MVPA in boys and girls and TV time among girls). There were positive correlations between BMI and being body bullied, as well as between TV and VG for boys (0.32, p<0.001 and 0.24, p<0.001, respectively) and girls (0.30, p<0.001 and 0.30, p<0.001, respectively) at T1. It remained significant at T2 (boys: 0.18, p<0.05 and 0.16, p<0.01; girls: 0.21, p<0.01 and 0.22, p<0.01, respectively). Examining the cross-lagged paths between being body bullied and HRSB, we observed that the reciprocal model provided the best fit for boys, indicating that BMI at T1 had a significant effect in being body bullied at T2 (0.12, p<0.05) and being body bullied at T1 had an effect on VG at T2 (0.14, p<0.01). Among girls the forward causation model showed the best fit, demonstrating a significant effect of being body bullied at T1 on VG at T2 (0.16, p<0.01). Apart from MVPA, both being body bullying and HRSB were largely stable across adolescence. For boys and girls alike, exposure to being body bullied seemed to increase their time spent on VG, while for boys BMI also predicted being body bullied. This study highlighted the complex interplay between being body bullied and HRSB and the importance of acknowledging gender differences in this context."
https://openalex.org/W2773871117,"Postural control and joint position sense are essential for safely undertaking leisure and professional activities, particularly at high altitude. We tested whether exposure to a 12-day trek with a gradual ascent to high altitude impairs postural control and joint position sense. This was a repeated measures observational study of 12 military service personnel (28±4 years). Postural control (sway velocity measured by a portable force platform) during standing balance, a Sharpened Romberg Test and knee joint position sense were measured, in England (113m elevation) and at 3 research camps (3619m, 4600m and 5140m) on a 12-day high altitude trek in the Dhaulagiri region of Nepal. Pulse oximetry, and Lake Louise scores were also recorded on the morning and evening of each trek day. Data were compared between altitudes and relationships between pulse oximetry, Lake Louise score, and sway velocity were explored. Total sway velocity during standing balance with eyes open (p = 0.003, d = 1.9) and during Sharpened Romberg test with eyes open (p = 0.007, d = 1.6) was significantly greater at altitudes of 3619m and 5140m when compared with sea level. Anterior-posterior sway velocity during standing balance with eyes open was also significantly greater at altitudes of 3619m and 5140m when compared with sea level (p = 0.001, d = 1.9). Knee joint position sense was not altered at higher altitudes. There were no significant correlations between Lake Louise scores, pulse oximetry and postural sway. Despite a gradual ascent profile, exposure to 3619 m was associated with impairments in postural control without impairment in knee joint position sense. Importantly, these impairments did not worsen at higher altitudes of 4600 m or 5140 m. The present findings should be considered during future trekking expeditions when developing training strategies targeted to manage impairments in postural control that occur with increasing altitude."
https://openalex.org/W2783849278,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an important cool-season perennial grass species used as forage and turf, and in conservation plantings. There are three morphotypes in hexaploid tall fescue: Continental, Mediterranean and Rhizomatous. This study was conducted to develop morphotype-specific molecular markers to distinguish Continental and Mediterranean tall fescues, and establish their relationships with other species of the Festuca genus for genomic inference. Chloroplast sequence variation and simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphism were explored in 12 genotypes of three tall fescue morphotypes and four Festuca species. Hypervariable chloroplast regions were retrieved by using 33 specifically designed primers followed by sequencing the PCR products. SSR polymorphism was studied using 144 tall fescue SSR primers. Four chloroplast (NFTCHL17, NFTCHL43, NFTCHL45 and NFTCHL48) and three SSR (nffa090, nffa204 and nffa338) markers were identified which can distinctly differentiate Continental and Mediterranean morphotypes. A primer pair, NFTCHL45, amplified a 47 bp deletion between the two morphotypes is being routinely used in the Noble Research Institute’s core facility for morphotype discrimination. Both chloroplast sequence variation and SSR diversity showed a close association between Rhizomatous and Continental morphotypes, while the Mediterranean morphotype was in a distant clade. F. pratensis and F. arundinacea var. glaucescens, the P and G1G2 genome donors, respectively, were grouped with the Continental clade, and F. mairei (M1M2 genome) grouped with the Mediterranean clade in chloroplast sequence variation, while both F. pratensis and F. mairei formed independent clade in SSR analysis. Age estimation based on chloroplast sequence variation indicated that the Continental and Mediterranean clades might have been colonized independently during 0.65 ± 0.06 and 0.96 ± 0.1 million years ago (Mya) respectively. The findings of the study will enhance tall fescue breeding for persistence and productivity."
