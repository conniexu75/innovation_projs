https://openalex.org/W4200160422,"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designed, manufactured, and distributed the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The diagnostic panel targeted three viral nucleocapsid gene loci (N1, N2, and N3 primers and probes) to maximize sensitivity and to provide redundancy for virus detection if mutations occurred. After the first distribution of the diagnostic panel, state public health laboratories reported fluorescent signal in the absence of viral template (false-positive reactivity) for the N3 component and to a lesser extent for N1. This report describes the findings of an internal investigation conducted by the CDC to identify the cause(s) of the N1 and N3 false-positive reactivity. For N1, results demonstrate that contamination with a synthetic template, that occurred while the ""bulk"" manufactured materials were located in a research lab for quality assessment, was the cause of false reactivity in the first lot. Base pairing between the 3' end of the N3 probe and the 3' end of the N3 reverse primer led to amplification of duplex and larger molecules resulting in false reactivity in the N3 assay component. We conclude that flaws in both assay design and handling of the ""bulk"" material, caused the problems with the first lot of the 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel. In addition, within this study, we found that the age of the examined diagnostic panel reagents increases the frequency of false positive results for N3. We discuss these findings in the context of improvements to quality control, quality assurance, and assay validation practices that have since been improved at the CDC."
https://openalex.org/W4200287280,"Background Historically social connection has been an important way through which humans have coped with large-scale threatening events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have deprived people of major sources of social support and coping, with others representing threats. Hence, a major stressor during the pandemic has been a sense of social disconnection and loneliness. This study explores how people’s experience of compassion and feeling socially safe and connected, in contrast to feeling socially disconnected, lonely and fearful of compassion, effects the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress. Methods Adult participants from the general population ( N = 4057) across 21 countries worldwide, completed self-report measures of social connection (compassion for self, from others, for others; social safeness), social disconnection (fears of compassion for self, from others, for others; loneliness), perceived threat of COVID-19, post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Results Perceived threat of COVID-19 predicted increased post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress. Social connection (compassion and social safeness) predicted higher post-traumatic growth and traumatic stress, whereas social disconnection (fears of compassion and loneliness) predicted increased traumatic symptoms only. Social connection heightened the impact of perceived threat of COVID-19 on post-traumatic growth, while social disconnection weakened this impact. Social disconnection magnified the impact of the perceived threat of COVID-19 on traumatic stress. These effects were consistent across all countries. Conclusions Social connection is key to how people adapt and cope with the worldwide COVID-19 crisis and may facilitate post-traumatic growth in the context of the threat experienced during the pandemic. In contrast, social disconnection increases vulnerability to develop post-traumatic stress in this threatening context. Public health and Government organizations could implement interventions to foster compassion and feelings of social safeness and reduce experiences of social disconnection, thus promoting growth, resilience and mental wellbeing during and following the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200420336,"Major life events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affect psychological and physiological health. Social support, or the lack thereof, can modulate these effects. The context of the COVID-19 pandemic offered a unique opportunity to better understand how dogs may provide social support for their owners and buffer heightened symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression and contribute to happiness during a major global crisis. Participants (768 pet dog owners and 767 potential pet dog owners) answered an online survey, including validated depression, anxiety, happiness psychometric scales, attitude to and commitment towards pet, and perceived social support. Potential pet dog owners were defined as individuals who did not own a dog at the time of the survey but would be very or extremely interested in owning one in the future. Dog owners reported having significantly more social support available to them compared to potential dog owners, and their depression scores were also lower, compared to potential dog owners. There were no differences in anxiety and happiness scores between the two groups. Dog owners had a significantly more positive attitude towards and commitment to pets. Taken together, our results suggest that dog ownership may have provided people with a stronger sense of social support, which in turn may have helped buffer some of the negative psychological impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4200212739,"Migratory birds play an important role in the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. To investigate the prevalence of MDR Escherichia coli in migratory birds in China and potential relationships with the environment, a total of 1387 samples (fecal samples, cloacal swabs, or throat swabs) were collected from migratory birds from three different river basins in China. The collected samples were processed and subjected to bacteriological examinations. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the recovered isolates was performed using the E-test for the detection of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Some antibiotic resistance genes were detected and the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. In total, 478 (34.7%) E. coli isolates were recovered. The results showed that the drug-resistant E. coli isolates were highly resistant to β-lactams (43.7%) and tetracycline (22.6%), and 73 (15.3%) were MDR, including eight that were extended spectrum β-lactamase-positive. The retrieved strains harbored the blaCTX-M, blaTEM-1, tet(A), tet(B), tet(M), sul1, sul2, sul3, cmlA, floR, and intI1 genes with a prevalence of 5.9%, 36.4%, 80.5%, 11.9%, 6.8%, 6.8%, 47.5%, 12.7%, 50.8%, 37.3%, and 61.0%, respectively. The drug resistance rate of the isolates from southern China was higher than those from northern China. The E. coli samples collected for migratory birds in the Pearl River Basin had the highest proportion (46.7%) MDR isolates. Furthermore, MDR bacteria carried by migratory birds were closely related to the antibiotic content in the basin, which confirms that MDR bacteria carried by migratory birds are likely acquired from the environment. This study also confirmed that migratory birds are potential transmitters of MDR bacteria, demonstrating the need to reduce the use and emission of antibiotics and further in-depth studies on the mechanisms underlying drug resistance of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W4200043972,"Introduction While there has been considerable analysis of the health and economic effects of COVID-19 in the Global North, representative data on the distribution and depth of social and economic impacts in Africa has been more limited. Methods We analyze household data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first wave of COVID in four African countries. We evaluate the short-term changes to household economic status and assess women’s access to health care during the first wave of COVID-19 in nationally representative samples of women aged 15–49 in Kenya and Burkina Faso, and in sub-nationally representative samples of women aged 15–49 in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo and Lagos, Nigeria. We examine prevalence and distribution of household income loss, food insecurity, and access to health care during the COVID-19 lockdowns across residence and pre-pandemic wealth categories. We then regress pre-pandemic individual and household sociodemographic characteristics on the three outcomes. Results In three out of four samples, over 90% of women reported partial or complete loss of household income since the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions. Prevalence of food insecurity ranged from 17.0% (95% CI 13.6–20.9) to 39.8% (95% CI 36.0–43.7), and the majority of women in food insecure households reported increases in food insecurity during the COVID-19 restriction period. In contrast, we did not find significant barriers to accessing health care during COVID restrictions. Between 78·3% and 94·0% of women who needed health care were able successfully access it. When we examined pre-pandemic sociodemographic correlates of the outcomes, we found that the income shock of COVID-19 was substantial and distributed similarly across wealth groups, but food insecurity was concentrated among poorer households. Contrary to a-priori expectations, we find little evidence of women experiencing barriers to health care, but there is significant need for food support."
https://openalex.org/W4200093232,"Functional exercise is crucial for breast cancer patients after surgery, and the use of virtual reality technology to assist patients with postoperative upper limb functional rehabilitation has gradually attracted the attention of researchers. However, the usability of the developed rehabilitation system is still unknown to a large extent. The purpose of this study was to develop a virtual reality upper limb rehabilitation system for patients after breast cancer surgery and to explore its usability.We built a multidisciplinary team based on virtual reality and human-computer interaction technology and designed and developed an upper limb function rehabilitation system for breast cancer patients after surgery. Breast cancer patients were recruited from a grade III-a general hospital in Changchun city for the experiment. We used the System Usability Scale to evaluate the system availability, the Presence Questionnaire scale to measure the immersive virtual reality scene, and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire subjective measurement scale for simulator sickness symptoms.This upper limb rehabilitation system hardware consisted of Head-mounted Display, a control handle and notebook computers. The software consisted of rehabilitation exercises and game modules. A total of 15 patients were tested on this system, all of whom were female. The mean age was 54.73±7.78 years, and no patients were excluded from the experiment because of adverse reactions such as dizziness and vomiting. The System Usability Scale score was 90.50±5.69, the Presence Questionnaire score was 113.40±9.58, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-nausea score was 0.93±1.16, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-oculomotor score was 0.80±1.27, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire-disorientation score was 0.80±1.27, and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire total score was 2.53±3.40.This study fills in the blanks regarding the upper limb rehabilitation of breast cancer patients based on virtual reality technology system usability research. As the starting point of research in the future, we will improve the system's function and design strictly randomized controlled trials, using larger samples in the promotion, to evaluate its application in breast cancer patients with upper limbs and other physiological functions and the feasibility and effects of rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4200571320,"Most traits in livestock, crops and humans are polygenic, that is, a large number of loci contribute to genetic variation. Effects at these loci lie along a continuum ranging from common low-effect to rare high-effect variants that cumulatively contribute to the overall phenotype. Statistical methods to calculate the effect of these loci have been developed and can be used to predict phenotypes in new individuals. In agriculture, these methods are used to select superior individuals using genomic breeding values; in humans these methods are used to quantitatively measure an individual's disease risk, termed polygenic risk scores. Both fields typically use SNP array genotypes for the analysis. Recently, genotyping-by-sequencing has become popular, due to lower cost and greater genome coverage (including structural variants). Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) portable sequencers have the potential to combine the benefits genotyping-by-sequencing with portability and decreased turn-around time. This introduces the potential for in-house clinical genetic disease risk screening in humans or calculating genomic breeding values on-farm in agriculture. Here we demonstrate the potential of the later by calculating genomic breeding values for four traits in cattle using low-coverage ONT sequence data and comparing these breeding values to breeding values calculated from SNP arrays. At sequencing coverages between 2X and 4X the correlation between ONT breeding values and SNP array-based breeding values was > 0.92 when imputation was used and > 0.88 when no imputation was used. With an average sequencing coverage of 0.5x the correlation between the two methods was between 0.85 and 0.92 using imputation, depending on the trait. This suggests that ONT sequencing has potential for in clinic or on-farm genomic prediction, however, further work to validate these findings in a larger population still remains."
https://openalex.org/W4200081580,"Cancer is one of the most important public health problems in the world. The curative effect of traditional surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is limited and has inevitable side effects. As a potential target for tumor therapy, few studies have comprehensively analyzed the role of CALR in cancers. Therefore, by using GeneCards, UALCAN, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, COSMIC, Regulome Explorer, String, GeneMANIA and TIMER databases, we collected and analyzed relevant data to conduct in-depth bioinformatics research on the CALR expression in Pan-cancer to assess the possibility of CALR as a potential therapeutic target and survival biomarker. We studied the CALR expression in normal human tissues and various tumors of different stages, and found that CALR expression was associated with relapse free survival (RFS). We verified the expression of CALR in breast cancer cell lines by vitro experiments. Mutations of CALR were widely present in tumors. CALR interacted with different genes and various proteins. In tumors, a variety of immune cells are closely related to CALR. In conclusion, CALR can be used as a biomarker for predicting prognosis and a potential target for tumor molecular and immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4200102578,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected health care systems worldwide. Multidisciplinary teams provide specialist palliative home care (SPHC) for patients with incurable, severe, progressive diseases. These patients are at the same time at high risk, if infected, highly constricted by containment measures, and dependent on support.To explore i) how German SPHC teams were affected by the pandemic during the first wave, ii) which challenges they faced, and iii) which strategies helped to handle the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for providing good SPHC.Four focus groups (with representatives of 18 SPHC teams) and five guided interviews with stakeholders were conducted and analysed using qualitative content analysis.Seven key categories emerged from the data. A category in the background describes dependence on organizational characteristics (e.g. sponsorship), which varied by regional factors. Information management was a challenge to SPHC teams, as they had to collect, interpret and adapt, and disseminate information. They reported a shift in patient care because of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to restricted home visits, visitation ban in nursing homes, and difficulties for hospital, hospice and nursing home admissions. Measures to reduce risk of infection impeded teamwork. Teams relied upon their local networks in crisis management, but felt often overlooked by local health authorities. Their respective SPHC state associations supported them in information management and exchange.The pandemic has severely impacted home care for especially vulnerable seriously ill and dying people. A good network with local health providers and authorities could help to harmonize local regulations and ensure quality care for all patient groups. SPHC teams could play an important role in caring for palliative patients with COVID-19 who are not admitted to a hospital due to preferences or resources."
https://openalex.org/W4200127209,"Sugarcane is one of the main alternative sources of biomass for the biofuel sector, and its large-scale production has considerable environmental impact. Organomineral fertilizers formulated with potential environmental contaminants, such as filter cake and sewage sludge, positively influence plant growth and development. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical and physical characteristics of sugarcane fertilized with pelletized organomineral fertilizers based on filter cake or sewage sludge. Eight field treatments were applied, based on three organomineral fertilizer compositions (50%, 100%, and 150%) associated with two organic matter (OM) sources (filter cake or sewage sludge), in addition to a control with 100% mineral fertilizer application, and a no-fertilization control (0%). Sugarcane attributes were evaluated during two consecutive harvests. The weights of stalks per hectare (ton ha -1 ), sugarcane productivity (ton ha -1 ), quantity of sugar per hectare (TSH, ton ha -1 ), and physicochemical properties of sugarcane juice (pol [%], Brix [%], purity [%], and fiber [%]) were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the attributes between OM sources or organomineral fertilization treatments and the exclusive mineral fertilization. The organomineral fertilizer application rate recommended for maximum quantitative and qualitative sugarcane in the first sugarcane harvest was between 2 and 9% above the regular recommendation for mineral fertilizer, regardless of the OM source. In the second harvest, the sewage sludge source increased total sugar and sugarcane per hectare by 4.68 and 4.19%, respectively, compared to the sugarcane filter cake source. Sewage sludge and sugarcane filter cake are viable alternatives for organomineral composition and could improve economic returns and minimize negative environmental impacts in sugarcane cultivation systems."
https://openalex.org/W4200343821,"As a reflection of prominent cultural norms, children's literature plays an integral role in the acquisition and development of societal attitudes. Previous reports of male overrepresentation in books targeted towards children are consistent with a history of gender disparity across media and society. However, it is unknown whether such bias has been attenuated in recent years with increasing emphasis on gender equity and greater accessibility of books. Here, we provide an up-to-date estimate of the relative proportion of males and females featured as single protagonists in 3,280 children's books (0-16 years) published between 1960-2020. We find that although the proportion of female protagonists has increased over this 60-year period, male protagonists remain overrepresented even in recent years. Importantly, we also find persistent effects related to author gender, age of the target audience, character type (human vs. non-human), and book genre (fiction vs. non-fiction) on the male-to-female ratio of protagonists. We suggest that this comprehensive account of the factors influencing the rates of appearance of male and female protagonists can be leveraged to develop specific recommendations for promoting more equitable gender representation in children's literature, with important consequences for child development and society."
https://openalex.org/W4200478095,"Worldwide, children with disabilities are a vulnerable population and at high risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. There is little information on the impact that COVID-19 had on children with disabilities and their families, particularly in low-income settings. This assessment describes the extent to which the pandemic impacted seven indicators of well-being in three low-income communities in Lusaka, Zambia.Interviews were conducted with a random selection of families participating in an existing program (n = 39), community health workers (n = 6), healthcare workers (n = 7) and government officials (n = 2). Descriptive data was summarized and qualitative responses reviewed for themes.Most families reported a major loss of income resulting in food insecurity (79%), housing instability (67%), stress (36%), and increased risk of child separation and neglect (18%). Most families did not report receiving governmental financial assistance and reported loss of access to health services for their child such as physiotherapy (33%). Stakeholders interviewed reported that COVID-19 information was widely available although few specific interventions for children. Families were seen to have greater food insecurity, more poverty, more crowding, less healthcare services and children left alone or on the streets to beg.COVID-19 and related containment measures have impacted the lives of children with disabilities and their families to a great extent. There is an urgent need for disability-inclusive responses that deliberately address the needs of children with disabilities and their families, notably uninterrupted access to adequate food, inclusive education, rehabilitation therapy, and income-generating activities."
https://openalex.org/W4200463462,"CAMEL is considered one of the well-known banking rating systems used to build a proper bank ranking. In our paper, we investigate the CAMEL rating for Saudi banks, which is considered the second largest banking sector in GCC. The Saudi banking sector consists of 11 banks and is the leading sector in the Saudi stock index (TASI). In this research, we aim to determine the ranking of Saudi banks according to CAMEL composite and CAMEL overall ratings and explore the effects of these ratings on banks’ total deposits for the period from 2014 to 2018. The methodology involves four phases. In the first phase, we calculate the key financial ratios of CAMEL’s composites for each bank. In the second phase, we rank the banks from 1 to 11 to each one of CAMEL’s composites for each bank per year. In the third phase, we rank Saudi banks according to CAMEL composite and CAMEL overall. Finally, in the fourth phase, we run a regression model using CAMEL financial ratios rank as independent variable and banks’ total deposits as a dependent variable. Using the stepwise regression method, the results indicated that the best regression model has an adjusted R 2 of 73.4% and a standard error of around 0.58. The results further indicated that capital measured by CAR, management as an efficiency ratio, earning with ROE proxy, and liquidity as loans to deposits have positive effects on banks’ total deposits. Meanwhile, earnings as net interest income to net revenue and liquidity calculated by CASA have a negative effect on banks’ total deposits. Finally, asset quality ratios and the rest of the ratios have no significant effect on banks’ total deposits."
https://openalex.org/W4200583209,"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) showed susceptibility to diverse animal species. We conducted this study to understand the spatial epidemiology, genetic diversity, and statistically significant genetic similarity along with per-gene recombination events of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SC2r-CoVs) in animals globally. We collected a number of different animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its related viruses. Then, we retrieved genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SC2r-CoVs from GISAID and NCBI GenBank for genomic and mutational analysis. Although the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, the diverse SC2r-CoV have been detected in multiple Rhinolophus bat species and in Malayan pangolin. To date, human-to-animal spillover events have been reported in cat, dog, tiger, lion, gorilla, leopard, ferret, puma, cougar, otter, and mink in 25 countries. Phylogeny and genetic recombination events of SC2r-CoVs showed higher similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and BANAL-103 for most of the genes and to some Malayan pangolin coronavirus (CoV) strains for the N protein from bats and pangolin showed close resemblance to SARS-CoV-2. The clustering of animal and human strains from the same geographical area has proved human-to-animal transmission of the virus. The Alpha, Delta and Mu-variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in dog, gorilla, lion, tiger, otter, and cat in the USA, India, Czech Republic, Belgium, and France with momentous genetic similarity with human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The mink variant mutation (spike_Y453F) was detected in both humans and domestic cats. Moreover, the dog was affected mostly by clade O (66.7%), whereas cat and American mink were affected by clade GR (31.6 and 49.7%, respectively). The α-variant was detected as 2.6% in cat, 4.8% in dog, 14.3% in tiger, 66.7% in gorilla, and 77.3% in lion. The highest mutations observed in mink where the substitution of D614G in spike (95.2%) and P323L in NSP12 (95.2%) protein. In dog, cat, gorilla, lion, and tiger, Y505H and Y453F were the common mutations followed by Y145del, Y144del, and V70I in S protein. We recommend vaccine provision for pet and zoo animals to reduce the chance of transmission in animals. Besides, continuous epidemiological and genomic surveillance of coronaviruses in animal host is crucial to find out the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent future CoVs threats to humans."

There is a lack of evidence on the prevalence of hypertension, prehypertension, and related factors among adult populations of Wolaita, southern Ethiopia.To assess the prevalence of hypertension, prehypertension, and related factors among adult populations of Wolaita, southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 2483 adult residents, selected using a two-stage random sampling technique. The quantitative data collected from structured questionnaires; anthropometric and biochemical measurements were entered into EpiData version 3.1 using double-entry systems. We determined the weighted prevalence of hypertension and pre-hypertension for the two-stage survey. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with hypertension and carried out after declaring the data set as survey data to account for the effect of clustering. An adjusted coefficient with 95% CI was used to ascertain the significance of the association.The weighted prevalence of hypertension and prehypertension in the Wolaita area was 31.3% (27.7%-35.1%) and 46.4% (42.9%-50.0%) respectively. The weighted prevalence of hypertension of those who were not aware of their hypertension until the time of the survey was 29.8%% (26.5%-33.3%). Where the weighted prevalence of self-reported cases of hypertension was 2.2% (1.2%-3.8%). Obesity, sugar-sweetened food consumption, male sex, elevated total cholesterol, raised fasting blood sugar, and advancing age were positively associated with hypertension.The prevalence of hypertension among adults in Wolaita was high. A small proportion of the affected people are aware of their high blood pressure. This study reported a high prevalence of pre-hypertension; which indicates a high percentage of people at risk of hypertension. It is essential to develop periodic screening programs, and primary intervention strategies such as the prevention of obesity, and reduction of sugar-sweetened food consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4226174997,"We compared the performance of dyslexic and typical readers on two perceptual tasks, the Vanderbilt Holistic Face Processing Task and the Holistic Word Processing Task. Both yield a metric of holistic processing that captures the extent to which participants automatically attend to information that is spatially nearby but irrelevant to the task at hand. Our results show, for the first time, that holistic processing of faces is comparable in dyslexic and typical readers but that dyslexic readers show greater holistic processing of words. Remarkably, we show that these metrics predict the performance of dyslexic readers on a standardized reading task, with more holistic processing in both tasks associated with higher accuracy and speed. In contrast, a more holistic style on the words task predicts less accurate reading of both words and pseudowords for typical readers. We discuss how these findings may guide our conceptualization of the visual deficit in dyslexia."

Delay of hospitalization limits early treatment and the survival of patients. To date, the effects of early oseltamivir initiation within 24 hours from admission on patient mortality has remained unknown. This retrospective study reviewed and analyzed the clinical and non-clinical outcomes of 143 patients, with community-acquired influenza pneumonia, who received oseltamivir within 24 h (group A) and after 24 h (group B) from admission. Among the patients, 82 (57.3%) received oseltamivir within 24 h while 61 (42.7%) received oseltamivir after 24 h. The median time from symptom onset to admission for group A and group B was not statistically significant (P < 0.001). The 14-day mortality rate was 9% and 23% for group A and B, respectively (P = 0.03), while the 30-day mortality were 15% and 30% for group A and B, respectively (P = 0.05). Administration of oseltamivir within 24 h significantly affected 30-day mortality rates (adjust OR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.47-0.04, P < 0.01), particularly among patients with respiratory failure at admission (adjust OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0+.30-0.06, P < 0.01). Survival analysis of patient with influenza pneumonia and respiratory failure at admission demonstrated significant difference between those who received oseltamivir within and after 24 h (P = 0.002). The results indicated that early oseltamivir initiation within 24 h improved the survival outcome mainly among those with respiratory failure at admission."
https://openalex.org/W4200425121,"Genomic manipulation is a useful approach for elucidating the molecular pathways underlying aspects of development, physiology, and behaviour. However, a lack of gene-editing tools appropriated for use in reef fishes has meant the genetic underpinnings for many of their unique traits remain to be investigated. One iconic group of reef fishes ideal for applying this technique are anemonefishes (Amphiprioninae) as they are widely studied for their symbiosis with anemones, sequential hermaphroditism, complex social hierarchies, skin pattern development, and vision, and are raised relatively easily in aquaria. In this study, we developed a gene-editing protocol for applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the false clown anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris. Microinjection of zygotes was used to demonstrate the successful use of our CRISPR/Cas9 approach at two separate target sites: the rhodopsin-like 2B opsin encoding gene (RH2B) involved in vision, and Tyrosinase-producing gene (tyr) involved in the production of melanin. Analysis of the sequenced target gene regions in A. ocellaris embryos showed that uptake was as high as 73.3% of injected embryos. Further analysis of the subcloned mutant gene sequences combined with amplicon shotgun sequencing revealed that our approach had a 75% to 100% efficiency in producing biallelic mutations in F0 A. ocellaris embryos. Moreover, we clearly show a loss-of-function in tyr mutant embryos which exhibited typical hypomelanistic phenotypes. This protocol is intended as a useful starting point to further explore the potential application of CRISPR/Cas9 in A. ocellaris, as a platform for studying gene function in anemonefishes and other reef fishes."

We identified women who were infertile and created a 2:1 matched control group with women who were not infertile. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to further estimate the effects of OSA on female infertility.In this 14- year retrospective study, we included 4,078 patients having an initial diagnosis of female infertility. Of those women with infertility, 1.38% had a history of OSA compared with 0.63% of fertile controls (p = 0.002). The mean ages in the study groups were 32.19 ± 6.20 years, whereas the mean ages in the control groups were 32.24 ± 6.37years. Women with OSA had 2.101- times the risk of female infertility compared to women without OSA (p<0.001).Our study showed that OSA is more commonly seen in infertile women and increases the odds that a woman will be infertile. More studies need to be done on the whether or not diagnosing and treating OSA can decrease the rate of infertility."

A random sample of 270 reviews were rated by the three sentiment analysis tools. These reviews were rated by 3 blinded independent human reviewers and a pooled sentiment score was assigned. Kappa statistics and polychoric evalutaiton were used to assess the level of agreement. Disagreements between the automated and human reviewers were qualitatively assessed.There was good agreement between the sentiment assigned to reviews by the human reviews and ACDAPI (k = 0.660). The Google (k = 0.706) and Monkeylearn (k = 0.728) showed slightly better agreement at the expense of usability on a massive dataset. There were 33 disagreements in rating between ACDAPI and human reviewers, of which n = 16 were due to syntax errors, n = 10 were due to misappropriation of the strength of conflicting emotions and n = 7 were due to a lack of overtly emotive language in the text.There is good agreement between the sentiment of an online review assigned by a group of humans and by cloud-based sentiment analysis. This may allow the use of automated sentiment analysis for quality assessment of dental service provision in the NHS."

A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with lots of others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), had a safe play area (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.56) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.14, 95% CI: 1.68 to 15.79). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures."
https://openalex.org/W4200386356,"Dentistry is confronted with the functional and aesthetic consequences that result from an increased prevalence of misaligned and discrepant dental occlusal relations in modern industrialised societies. Previous studies have indicated that a reduction in jaw size in response to softer and more heavily processed foods during and following the Industrial Revolution (1,700 CE to present) was an important factor in increased levels of poor dental occlusion. The functional demands placed on the masticatory system play a crucial role in jaw ontogenetic development; however, the way in which chewing behaviours changed in response to the consumption of softer foods during this period remains poorly understood. Here we show that eating more heavily processed food has radically transformed occlusal power stroke kinematics. Results of virtual 3D analysis of the dental macrowear patterns of molars in 104 individuals dating to the Industrial Revolution (1,700-1,900 CE), and 130 of their medieval and early post-medieval antecedents (1,100-1,700 CE) revealed changes in masticatory behaviour that occurred during the early stages of the transition towards eating more heavily processed foods. The industrial-era groups examined chewed with a reduced transverse component of jaw movement. These results show a diminished sequence of occlusal contacts indicating that a dental revolution has taken place in modern times, involving a dramatic shift in the way in which teeth occlude and wear during mastication. Molar macrowear suggests a close connection between progressive changes in chewing since the industrialization of food production and an increase in the prevalence of poor dental occlusion in modern societies."
https://openalex.org/W4200490418,"Multiple previous studies have shown the monoclonal antibody Das-1 (formerly called 7E12H12) is specifically reactive towards metaplastic and carcinomatous lesions in multiple organs of the gastrointestinal system (e.g. Barrett's esophagus, intestinal-type metaplasia of the stomach, gastric adenocarcinoma, high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) as well as in other organs (bladder and lung carcinomas). Beyond being a useful biomarker in tissue, mAb Das-1 has recently proven to be more accurate than current paradigms for identifying cysts harboring advanced neoplasia. Though this antibody has been used extensively for clinical, basic science, and translational applications for decades, its epitope has remained elusive.In this study, we chemically deglycosylated a standard source of antigen, which resulted in near complete loss of the signal as measured by western blot analysis. The epitope recognized by mAb Das-1 was determined by affinity to a comprehensive glycan array and validated by inhibition of a direct ELISA.The epitope recognized by mAb Das-1 is 3'-Sulfo-Lewis A/C (3'-Sulfo-LeA/C). 3'-Sulfo-LeA/C is broadly reexpressed across numerous GI epithelia and elsewhere during metaplastic and carcinomatous transformation.3'-Sulfo-LeA/C is a clinically important antigen that can be detected both intracellularly in tissue using immunohistochemistry and extracellularly in cyst fluid and serum by ELISA. The results open new avenues for tumorigenic risk stratification of various gastrointestinal lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4205259110,"Diarrheal disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in dairy calves, is strongly associated with the health and composition of the gut microbiota. Clostridioides difficile is an opportunistic pathogen that proliferates and can produce enterotoxins when the host experiences gut dysbiosis. However, even asymptomatic colonization with C. difficile can be associated with differing degrees of microbiota disruption in a range of species, including people, swine, and dogs. Little is known about the interaction between C. difficile and the gut microbiota in dairy calves. In this study, we sought to define microbial features associated with C. difficile colonization in pre-weaned dairy calves less than 2 weeks of age. We characterized the fecal microbiota of 80 calves from 23 different farms using 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the microbiota of C. difficile-positive (n = 24) and C. difficile-negative calves (n = 56). Farm appeared to be the greatest source of variability in the gut microbiota. When controlling for calf age, diet, and farm location, there was no significant difference in Shannon alpha diversity (P = 0.50) or in weighted UniFrac beta diversity (P = 0.19) between C. difficile-positive and-negative calves. However, there was a significant difference in beta diversity as assessed using Bray-Curtiss diversity (P = 0.0077), and C. difficile-positive calves had significantly increased levels of Ruminococcus (gnavus group) (Adj. P = 0.052), Lachnoclostridium (Adj. P = 0.060), Butyricicoccus (Adj. P = 0.060), and Clostridium sensu stricto 2 compared to C. difficile-negative calves. Additionally, C. difficile-positive calves had fewer microbial co-occurrences than C. difficile-negative calves, indicating reduced bacterial synergies. Thus, while C. difficile colonization alone is not associated with dysbiosis and is therefore unlikely to result in an increased likelihood of diarrhea in dairy calves, it may be associated with a more disrupted microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W4200051472,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a multidrug resistant pathogen associated with high mortality and morbidity in patients having compromised immunity. The efflux systems of S. maltophilia include SmeABC and SmeDEF proteins, which assist in acquisition of multiple-drug-resistance. In this study, proteome based mapping was utilized to find out the potential drug targets for S. maltophilia strain k279a. Various tools of computational biology were applied to remove the human-specific homologous and pathogen-specific paralogous sequences from the bacterial proteome. The CD-HIT analysis selected 4315 proteins from total proteome count of 4365 proteins. Geptop identified 407 essential proteins, while the BlastP revealed approximately 85 non-homologous proteins in the human genome. Moreover, metabolic pathway and subcellular location analysis were performed for essential bacterial genes, to describe their role in various cellular processes. Only two essential proteins (Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-UDP-N acetyl glucosamine O-acyltransferase and D-alanine-D-alanine ligase) as candidate for potent targets were found in proteome of the pathogen, in order to design new drugs. An online tool, Swiss model was employed to model the 3D structures of both target proteins. A library of 5000 phytochemicals was docked against those proteins through the molecular operating environment (MOE). That resulted in to eight inhibitors for both proteins i.e. enterodiol, aloin, ononin and rhinacanthinF for the Acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-UDP-N acetyl glucosamine O-acyltransferase, and rhazin, alkannin beta, aloesin and ancistrocladine for the D-alanine-D-alanine ligase. Finally the ADMET was done through ADMETsar. This study supported the development of natural as well as cost-effective drugs against S. maltophilia. These inhibitors displayed the effective binding interactions and safe drug profiles. However, further in vivo and in vitro validation experiment might be performed to check their drug effectiveness, biocompatibility and their role as effective inhibitors."

The present paper tries to assess how different anthropometric measures of obesity and physical activity affects cardiovascular disease risk among older adults in India.The data from Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) has been used. The total sample size for the present study is 31,464 older adults aged 60 years and above. Chi-square test and binary logistic regression has been used to measure the association of obesity measures and CVD prevalence.About 35.2% (n = 11,058) of the older adults suffered from CVD. Moreover, 22.2% (n = 6,217) of the older adults were obese/overweight, 23.7% (n = 6,651) had high risk waist circumference and 77.0% (n = 21,593) had high risk waist-Hip ratio. The likelihood of CVD was 60%, 50%, and 34% significantly higher among older adults who were obese/overweight [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.60; CI: 1.48-1.72], had high risk waist circumference [AOR: 1.50; CI: 1.39-1.62] and high risk waist-Hip ratio [AOR: 1.34; CI: 1.25-1.44], respectively compared to older adults with normal BMI and those who do not have a high risk waist circumference and high risk waist hip ratio. Moreover, older adults who never did physical activity had 22 per cent higher risk of CVD than those who did frequent [AOR: 1.22; CI: 1.13-1.32] physical activity.The burden of overweight and obesity along with physical inactivity increases the risk of CVD in older adults. These findings highlight the urgent need for framing direct and indirect strategies to control obesity in order to reduce the burden of CVD among older adults in India."

Many studies have associated this sign with coronary artery disease and some with cerebrovascular disease. The objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence of the Frank's sign in patients suffering from acute stroke with a particular focus on its prevalence in each of the five aetiopathogenic stroke subtypes. Special interest is given to embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), correlating the sign with clinical and radiological markers that support an underlying causal profile in this subgroup.Cross-sectional descriptive study including 124 patients admitted consecutively to a stroke unit after suffering an acute stroke. The Frank's sign was evaluated by the same blinded member of the research team from photographs taken of the patients. The stroke subtype was classified following SSS-TOAST criteria and the aetiological study was performed following the ESO guidelines.The Frank's sign was present in 75 patients and was more prevalent in patients with an ischaemic stroke in comparison with haemorrhagic stroke (63.9 vs. 37.5, p<0.05). A similar prevalence was found in the different ischaemic stroke subtypes. The Frank's sign was significantly associated with age, particularly in patients older than 70 who had vascular risk factors. Atherosclerotic plaques found in carotid ultrasonography were significantly more frequent in patients with the Frank's sign (63.6%, p<0.05). Analysing the ESUS, we also found an association with age and a higher prevalence of the Frank's sign in patients with vascular risk factors and a tendency to a high prevalence of atherosclerosis markers.The Frank's sign is prevalent in all aetiopathogenic ischaemic stroke subtypes, including ESUS, where it could be helpful in suspecting the underlying cardioembolic or atherothrombotic origin and guiding the investigation of atherosclerosis in patients with ESUS and the Frank's sign."
https://openalex.org/W4225816890,"Medical personnel working in emergency rooms (ER) are at increased risk of mental health problems and suicidality. There is increasing evidence that mindfulness-based interventions can improve burnout and other mental health outcomes in health care providers. In contrast, few longitudinal prospective studies have examined protective functions of dispositional mindfulness in this population. The objective of this study was to examine whether mindfulness prospectively predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment in a sample of emergency care professionals. The authors administered online surveys to ER personnel prior to work in ER, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. Participants were 190 ER personnel (73% residents, 16% medical students, 11% nurses). Linear mixed effects regression was used to model longitudinal 3-month and 6-month follow up of depression, anxiety, and social impairment. Predictors included time-varying contemporaneous work stressors, perceived social support at work and life events, and baseline dispositional mindfulness, demographics, and workplace characteristics. Mindfulness indexed when starting ER work predicted less depression, anxiety, and social impairment 6 months later. Mindfulness remained a strong predictor of mental health outcomes after controlling for time-varying stressful events in emergency care, negative life events, and social support at work. Mindfulness moderated the adverse impact of poor social support at work on depression. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to show that mindfulness prospectively and robustly predicts anxiety, depression, and social impairment. Results support the role of mindfulness as a potential resilience factor in at-risk health care providers."
https://openalex.org/W4200048353,"Tobacco smoking is the most typically employed in patients with mental disorders; among them, patients with schizophrenia are the very best users. The rate of smoking among patients with schizophrenia is between two and three times greater than the general population in western countries. However, there is a scarcity of studies on the magnitude and associated factors of tobacco dependence among patients with schizophrenia in Ethiopia. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of tobacco dependence and associated factors among patients with schizophrenia at Mettu Karl referral, Bedelle, and Agaro hospitals, Southwest, Ethiopia.Hospital-based the multistage stratified cross-sectional study design was conducted among 524 patients with schizophrenia who are on treatment. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) was used to screen the prevalence of tobacco dependence. Analysis of data was done using SPSS version 24.The prevalence of tobacco dependence among study participants was 22.3% (95% CI) (18.6, 26). Concerning the severity of tobacco dependence, 3.5%, 13.8%, and 5% of the respondents report moderate, high, and very high levels of tobacco dependence respectively. The proportions of tobacco dependence among male schizophrenic patients 88 (25.8%) were higher compared to their counterparts 27 (15.5%). After controlling the effects of cofounders in the final regression analysis, male gender (AOR 2.19, 95% CI = 1.25, 3.83), being on treatment for more than 5years (AOR 4.37, 95% CI = 2.11, 9.02), having a history of admission (AOR 4.01, 95% CI = 1.99, 8.11), and family history of mental illness (AOR 1.90, 95% CI = 1.04, 3.48) were shown to have a significant positive association with tobacco dependence.A study show a significant proportion of tobacco dependence among people living with schizophrenia. Factors like, being male gender, being on treatment for more than 5 years, having a history of admission, and family history of mental illness was found to have a significant positive association with tobacco dependence.

Penstemon is divided into six subgenera occupying all North American habitats including the Arctic tundra, Central American tropical forests, alpine meadows, arid deserts, and temperate grasslands. Due to the rapid rate of diversification and speciation, previous phylogenetic studies using individual and concatenated chloroplast sequences have failed to resolve many polytomic clades. We investigated the efficacy of utilizing the plastid genomes (plastomes) of 29 species in the Lamiales order, including five newly sequenced Penstemon plastomes, for analyzing phylogenetic relationships and resolving problematic clades. We compared whole-plastome based phylogenies to phylogenies based on individual gene sequences (matK, ndhF, psaA, psbA, rbcL, rpoC2, and rps2) and concatenated sequences. We also We found that our whole-plastome based phylogeny had higher nodal support than all other phylogenies, which suggests that it provides greater accuracy in describing the hierarchal relationships among taxa as compared to other methods. We found that the genus Penstemon forms a monophyletic clade sister to, but separate from, the Old World taxa of the Plantaginaceae family included in our study. Our whole-plastome based phylogeny also supports the rearrangement of the Scrophulariaceae family and improves resolution of major clades and genera of the Lamiales."
https://openalex.org/W4200123339,"The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of infection tracking. The role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infections within this pandemic has become increasingly evident. Modern phylogenetic tools that take into account asymptomatic or undiagnosed individuals can help guide public health responses. We finetuned established phylogenetic pipelines using published SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to examine reasonable estimate transmission networks with the inference of unsampled infection sources. The system utilised Bayesian phylogenetics and TransPhylo to capture the evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses gave insight into the transmissions within a population including unsampled sources of infection and the results aligned with epidemiological observations. We were able to observe the effects of preventive measures in Canada's ""Atlantic bubble"" and in populations such as New York State. The tools also inferred the cross-species disease transmission of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York City's Bronx Zoo. These phylogenetic tools offer a powerful approach in response to both the COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks."

https://openalex.org/W4200154639,"Thioredoxin (Trx), a small redox protein, exhibits thermal stability at high temperatures regardless of its origin, including psychrophiles. Trxs have a common structure consisting of the central β-sheet flanked by an aliphatic cluster on one side and an aromatic cluster on the other side. Although the roles of aromatic amino acids in the folding and stability of proteins have been studied extensively, the contributions of aromatic residues to the stability and function of Trx, particularly Trxs from cold-adapted organisms, have not been fully elucidated. This study examined the roles of aromatic amino acids in the aromatic cluster of a Trx from the psychrophilic Arctic bacterium Sphingomonas sp. PAMC 26621 (SpTrx). The aromatic cluster of SpTrx was comprised of W11, F26, F69, and F80, in which F26 at the β2 terminus was buried inside. The substitution of tyrosine for F26 changed the SpTrx conformation substantially compared to that of F69 and F80. Further biochemical and spectroscopic investigations on F26 showed that the F26Y, F26W, and F26A mutants resulted in structural instability of SpTrx in both urea- and temperature-induced unfolding and lower insulin reduction activities. The Trx reductase (SpTR) showed lower catalytic efficiencies against F26 mutants compared to the wild-type SpTrx. These results suggest that buried F26 is essential for maintaining the active-site conformation of SpTrx as an oxidoreductase and its structural stability for interactions with SpTR at colder temperatures."

Histologic features diagnostic of LS were the basis of pathologic evaluation. Foci of areas diagnostic for LS or non-LS strictures were chosen for RNA evaluation. In an initial screening analysis, 13 LS urethral strictures and 13 non-LS strictures were profiled via miRNA RT-qPCR arrays for 752 unique miRNA. A validation analysis of 23 additional samples (9 LS and 14 non-LS) was performed for 15 miRNAs. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v25. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using DIANA-mirPath v. 3.0.In the screening analysis 143 miRNAs were detected for all samples. 27 were differentially expressed between the groups (false discovery p-value <0.01). 15 of these miRNAs individually demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC)>0.90 for distinguishing between between LS and non-LS strictures. 11-fold upregulation of MiR-155-5p specifically was found in LS vs. non-LS strictures (p<0.001, AUC = 1.0). In the validation analysis, 13 of the 15 miRNAs tested were confirmed to have differential expression (false discovery p-value <0.10).To our knowledge this is the first study evaluating miRNA expression profiles in LS and non-LS USD. We identified several miRNAs that are differentially expressed in USD caused by LS vs other etiologies, which could potentially serve as biomarkers of LS USD. The top eight differentially expressed miRNAs have been linked to immune response processes as well as involvement in wound healing, primarily angiogenesis and fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W4200374364,"Passive acoustic monitoring is an important tool for studying marine mammals. Ocean bottom seismometer networks provide data sets of opportunity for studying blue whales ( Balaenoptera musculus ) which vocalize extensively at seismic frequencies. We describe methods to localize calls and obtain tracks using the B call of northeast Pacific blue whale recorded by a large network of widely spaced ocean bottom seismometers off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The first harmonic of the B call at ~15 Hz is detected using spectrogram cross-correlation. The seasonality of calls, inferred from a dataset of calls identified by an analyst, is used to estimate the probability that detections are true positives as a function of the strength of the detection. Because the spacing of seismometers reaches 70 km, faint detections with a significant probability of being false positives must be considered in multi-station localizations. Calls are located by maximizing a likelihood function which considers each strong detection in turn as the earliest arrival time and seeks to fit the times of detections that follow within a feasible time and distance window. An alternative procedure seeks solutions based on the detections that maximize their sum after weighting by detection strength and proximity. Both approaches lead to many spurious solutions that can mix detections from different B calls and include false detections including misidentified A calls. Tracks that are reliable can be obtained iteratively by assigning detections to localizations that are grouped in space and time, and requiring groups of at least 20 locations. Smooth paths are fit to tracks by including constraints that minimize changes in speed and direction while fitting the locations to their uncertainties or applying the double difference relocation method. The reliability of localizations for future experiments might be improved by increasing sampling rates and detecting harmonics of the B call."

We aimed to show whether the carotid canal can narrow according to morphological changes in the internal carotid artery.The carotid canal diameter was longitudinally measured in seven individuals who underwent carotid artery ligation. As moyamoya disease is known to be associated with negative remodeling of the internal carotid artery, the carotid canal diameter was measured in 106 patients with moyamoya disease, and an association with the outer diameter of the internal carotid artery or a correlation with the disease stage was investigated. The carotid canal was measured by computed tomography (106 patients), and the outer diameter of the artery was measured by high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (63 patients). The carotid canal area was calculated by the product of the maximum axial diameter and its perpendicular diameter.All seven patients who underwent carotid artery ligation showed narrowing of the carotid canal, and the carotid canal area decreased by 12.2%-28.9% during a mean follow-up period of 4.2 years. In patients with moyamoya disease, the carotid canal area showed a linear correlation with the outer area of the internal carotid artery (r = 0.657, p < 0.001), and a negative correlation with the disease stage (ρ = -0.283, p < 0.001).The bony carotid canal has plasticity, and its area reflects the outer area of the internal carotid artery, therefore, it can be used to assess the remodeling of the carotid artery. A narrow carotid canal may not necessarily indicate hypoplastic internal carotid artery."
https://openalex.org/W4200591190,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established clinical therapy, and directional DBS electrode designs are now commonly used in clinical practice. Directional DBS leads have the ability to increase the therapeutic window of stimulation, but they also increase the complexity of clinical programming. Therefore, computational models of DBS have become available in clinical software tools that are designed to assist in the identification of therapeutic settings. However, the details of how the DBS model is implemented can influence the predictions of the software. The goal of this study was to compare different methods for representing directional DBS electrodes within finite element volume conductor (VC) models. We evaluated 15 different DBS VC model variants and quantified how their differences influenced estimates on the spatial extent of axonal activation from DBS. Each DBS VC model included the same representation of the brain and head, but the details of the current source and electrode contact were different for each model variant. The more complex VC models explicitly represented the DBS electrode contacts, while the more simple VC models used boundary condition approximations. The more complex VC models required 2–3 times longer to mesh, build, and solve for the DBS voltage distribution than the more simple VC models. Differences in individual axonal activation thresholds across the VC model variants were substantial (-24% to +47%). However, when comparing total activation of an axon population, or estimates of an activation volume, the differences between model variants decreased (-7% to +8%). Nonetheless, the technical details of how the electrode contact and current source are represented in the DBS VC model can directly affect estimates of the voltage distribution and electric field in the brain tissue."

The bacterium is able to form small colony variants (SCVs) as part of the adaptive features in response to environmental stress. In this study, we characterize the genomic characteristics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and metabolic phenotypes of B. pseudomallei SCV and wild type (WT) strains. Whole-genome sequence analysis was performed to characterize the genomic features of two SCVs (CS and OS) and their respective parental WT strains (CB and OB). Phylogenetic relationship between the four draft genomes in this study and 19 publicly available genomes from various countries was determined. The four draft genomes showed a close phylogenetic relationship with other genomes from Southeast Asia. Broth microdilution and phenotype microarray were conducted to determine the AMR profiles and metabolic features (carbon utilization, osmolytes sensitivity, and pH conditions) of all strains. The SCV strains exhibited identical AMR phenotype with their parental WT strains. A limited number of AMR-conferring genes were identified in the B. pseudomallei genomes. The SCVs and their respective parental WT strains generally shared similar carbon-utilization profiles, except for D,L-carnitine (CS), g-hydroxybutyric acid (OS), and succinamic acid (OS) which were utilized by the SCVs only. No difference was observed in the osmolytes sensitivity of all strains. In comparison, WT strains were more resistant to alkaline condition, while SCVs showed variable growth responses at higher acidity. Overall, the genomes of the colony morphology variants of B. pseudomallei were largely identical, and the phenotypic variations observed among the different morphotypes were strain-specific."

This tool allows simple, unique, and anonymous participant IDs to be generated on the fly.Simulations were used to validate the uniqueness of the IDs as well as their anonymity.The tool can successfully generate IDs with a low collision rate while maintaining high anonymity. A practical compromise between integrity and anonymity was achieved when the ID space is about ten times the number of participants.The tool holds potential for making it easier to collect more comprehensive empirical evidence over time that in turn will provide a more solid basis for drawing reliable conclusions based on research data.

In humans, endogenous ligands for ERβ include 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol (3βAdiol) and androstenediol (Δ5-diol). We determined, for the first time, the exact serum levels of 3βAdiol and Δ5-diol in young healthy volunteers using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). We investigated the effect of the menstrual cycle on the levels of these steroids in women; then, we performed a gender comparison. Blood samples were collected from 48 subjects: 23 women (mean age = 28.4±7.8 years) and 25 men (mean age = 31.4±7.8 years). We collected the blood samples of women at three time-points in the menstrual cycle: the early follicular phase, ovulatory or mid-cycle phase, and mid-luteal phase. A total of 92 blood samples were analyzed using LC–MS/MS. The levels of two well-studied steroids, namely dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and 17β-estradiol (E2), were simultaneously measured. Depression rating scale (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Beck Depression Inventory-II and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) scores were also recorded at the time of blood sampling. Significant differences in the levels of 3βAdiol and E2 and in the depression rating scale scores were observed over the duration of the menstrual cycle of the women. The levels of 3βAdiol and Δ5-diol were significantly lower in women than in men. E2 levels were higher in women than in men, and DHEA levels did not differ significantly between men and women. Further, women had higher scores than men on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Sex differences in depressive symptoms can be explained by 3βAdiol and Δ5-diol levels, and the effect of the menstrual cycle on mood can be explained by 3βAdiol and E2 levels, not by Δ5-diol level."
https://openalex.org/W4200256696,"Objective Ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (bPI) in people living with HIV (PLWH) have been associated with renal impairment. Limited data are available from rural sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Using data from the Kilombero and Ulanga Antiretroviral Cohort Study (KIULARCO) in rural Tanzania from 2005-01/2020, we assessed the prevalence of renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2) at the time of switch from first-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) to bPI-regimen and the incidence of renal impairment on bPI. We assessed risk factors for renal impairment using logistic and Cox regression models. Results Renal impairment was present in 52/687 PLWH (7.6%) at the switch to bPI. Among 556 participants with normal kidney function at switch, 41 (7.4%) developed renal impairment after a median time of 3.5 (IQR 1.6–5.1) years (incidence 22/1,000 person-years (95%CI 16.1–29.8)). Factors associated with renal impairment at switch were older age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.55 per 10 years; 95%CI 1.15–2.11), body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 (aOR 2.80 versus ≥18kg/m 2 ; 95%CI 1.28–6.14) and arterial hypertension (aOR 2.33; 95%CI 1.03–5.28). The risk of renal impairment was lower with increased duration of ART use (aOR 0.78 per one-year increase; 95%CI 0.67–0.91). The renal impairment incidence under bPI was associated with older age (adjusted hazard ratio 2.01 per 10 years; 95%CI 1.46–2.78). Conclusions In PLWH in rural sub-Saharan Africa, prevalence and incidence of renal impairment among those who were switched from first-line to bPI-regimens were high. We found associations between renal impairment and older age, arterial hypertension, low BMI and time on ART."
https://openalex.org/W4200396641,"Organizations nowadays are under immense external pressure due to advancements in information technology, making it precarious. It also inserts extra pressure to keep the employees motivated and productive. Therefore, while information technology benefits the organization, it also challenges the organization and employees more. In order to meet these challenges, many organizations have begun to flatten their organizational structures and decentralized their management approaches. This study collected 336 valid questionnaires from 20 service companies. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were tested. In addition, the exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Relevant analysis and empirical analysis were also carried out using hierarchical regression. The study finds that (1) Goal-setting participation positively affects employees’ proactive behavior. (2) Perceived insider status plays a mediating role between goal-setting participation and employee proactive behavior. (3) The power distance positively modifies the goal-setting participation in the relationship of employee’s perceived insider status. (4) Power distance positively moderates perceived insider status in the relationship of goal-setting participation on employee proactive behavior through perceived insider status. This research applies goal-setting theory and social cognition theory to build a theoretical framework for the influence mechanism of goal-setting participation on employee’s proactive behavior. Expands the application scope of fundamental theoretical research and improve understanding of the relationship between goal-setting participation and employee’s proactive behavior. The research conclusions help organizations understand the formation mechanism of employees’ proactive behaviors, strengthen the focus on goal-setting participation, and optimize the relationship between leaders and employees."
https://openalex.org/W4200563052,"While dementia has been associated with specific causes of death, previous studies were relatively small autopsy series or population-based studies lacking autopsy confirmation and were restricted to Non-Latinx Whites. Here, we examine the association of dementia with autopsy-verified causes of death in racially-diverse older Brazilians.As part of the Pathology, Alzheimer´s and Related Dementias Study (PARDoS), a community-based study in Brazil, we included 1941 racially-diverse deceased, 65 years or older at death. We conducted a structured interview with legal informants including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale for dementia proximate to death. Causes of death were assessed after full-body autopsy and macroscopic examination of the brain, thoracic and abdominal/pelvic organs. Up to four causes of death were reported for each decedent. Causes of death were classified as circulatory, infectious, cancer and other. Logistic regression was used to determine associations of dementia with cause of death, controlling for age, sex, race, and education.Dementia was associated with a higher odds of an infectious cause of death (OR = 1.81, 95%CI:1.45-2.25), and with a lower odds of a circulatory disease as cause of death (OR = 0.69, 95%CI:0.54-0.86) and cancer as cause of death (OR = 0.41, 95%CI:0.24-0.71). Dementia was associated with a higher odds of pneumonia (OR = 1.92, 95%CI:1.53-2.40) and pulmonary embolism (OR = 2.31, 95%CI:1.75-3.05) as causes of death and with a lower odds of acute myocardial infarction (OR = 0.42, 95%CI:0.31-0.56) and arterial disease (OR = 0.76, 95%CI:0.61-0.94) as causes of death.Racially-diverse older Brazilians with dementia had a higher odds of an infectious cause of death and a lower odds of cancer and circulatory disease as causes of death than those without dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3160683459,"Propagation Phase Contrast Synchrotron Microtomography (PPC-SRμCT) is the gold standard for non-invasive and non-destructive access to internal structures of archaeological remains. In this analysis, the virtual specimen needs to be segmented to separate different parts or materials, a process that normally requires considerable human effort. In the Automated SEgmentation of Microtomography Imaging (ASEMI) project, we developed a tool to automatically segment these volumetric images, using manually segmented samples to tune and train a machine learning model. For a set of four specimens of ancient Egyptian animal mummies we achieve an overall accuracy of 94-98% when compared with manually segmented slices, approaching the results of off-the-shelf commercial software using deep learning (97-99%) at much lower complexity. A qualitative analysis of the segmented output shows that our results are close in terms of usability to those from deep learning, justifying the use of these techniques."
https://openalex.org/W4200320875,"Since long-chain fatty acids work as the primary energy source for the myocardium, radiolabeled long-chain fatty acids play an important role as imaging agents to diagnose metabolic heart dysfunction and heart diseases. With the aim of developing radiogallium-labeled fatty acids, herein four fatty acid-based tracers, [67Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-PDA, [67Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-MHDA, [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-PDA, and [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-MHDA, which are [67Ga]Ga-HBED-CC and [67Ga]Ga-DOTA conjugated with pentadecanoic acid (PDA) and 3-methylhexadecanoic acid (MHDA), were synthesized, and their potential for myocardial metabolic imaging was evaluated. Those tracers were found to be chemically stable in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline. Initial [67Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-PDA, [67Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-MHDA, [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-PDA, and [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-MHDA uptakes in the heart at 0.5 min postinjection were 5.01 ± 0.30%ID/g, 5.74 ± 1.02%ID/g, 5.67 ± 0.22%ID/g, and 5.29 ± 0.10%ID/g, respectively. These values were significantly lower than that of [123I]BMIPP (21.36 ± 2.73%ID/g). For their clinical application as myocardial metabolic imaging agents, further structural modifications are required to increase their uptake in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W4200372789,"Diphtheria is caused by a toxigenic bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria which is being an emerging pathogen in India. Since diphtheria morbidity and mortality continues to be high in the country, the present study aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of C. diphtheriae strains from India. A total of 441 diphtheria suspected specimens collected as part of the surveillance programme between 2015 and 2020 were studied. All the isolates were confirmed as C. diphtheriae with standard biochemical tests, ELEK's test, and real-time PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the subset of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to penicillin and complete susceptible to erythromycin and cefotaxime. Isolates were characterized using multi locus sequence typing method. MLST analysis for the 216 C. diphtheriae isolates revealed major diversity among the sequence types. A total of 34 STs were assigned with majority of the isolates belonged to ST466 (30%). The second most common ST identified was ST405 that was present in 14% of the isolates. The international clone ST50 was also seen. The identified STs were grouped into 8 different clonal complexes (CC). The majority belongs to CC5 followed by CC466, CC574 and CC209, however a single non-toxigenic strain belongs to CC42. This epidemiological analysis revealed the emergence of novel STs and the clones with better dissemination properties. This study has also provided information on the circulating strains of C. diphtheriae among the different regions of India. The molecular data generated through surveillance system can be utilized for further actions in concern."
https://openalex.org/W4200440488,"The manual processes used for risk assessments are not scaling to the amount of data available. Although automated approaches appear promising, they must be transparent in a public policy setting.Our goal is to create an automated approach that moves beyond retrieval to the extraction step of the information synthesis process, where evidence is characterized as supporting, refuting, or neutral with respect to a given outcome.We combine knowledge resources and natural language processing to resolve coordinated ellipses and thus avoid surface level differences between concepts in an ontology and outcomes in an abstract. As with a systematic review, the search criterion, and inclusion and exclusion criterion are explicit.The system scales to 482K abstracts on 27 chemicals. Results for three endpoints that are critical for cancer risk assessments show that refuting evidence (where the outcome decreased) was higher for cell proliferation (45.9%), and general cell changes (37.7%) than for cell death (25.0%). Moreover, cell death was the only end point where supporting claims were the majority (61.3%). If the number of abstracts that measure an outcome was used as a proxy for association there would be a stronger association with cell proliferation than cell death (20/27 chemicals). However, if the amount of supporting evidence was used (where the outcome increased) the conclusion would change for 21/27 chemicals (20 from proliferation to death and 1 from death to proliferation).We provide decision makers with a visual representation of supporting, neutral, and refuting evidence whilst maintaining the reproducibility and transparency needed for public policy. Our findings show that results from the retrieval step where the number of abstracts that measure an outcome are reported can be misleading if not accompanied with results from the extraction step where the directionality of the outcome is established."
https://openalex.org/W4200469973,"There is a developing interdisciplinary research field which has been trying to integrate results and expertise from various scientific areas, such as affective computing, pedagogical methodology and psychological appraisal theories, into learning environments. Moreover, anxiety recognition and regulation has attracted the interest of researchers as an important factor in the implementation of advanced learning environments. The present article explores the test anxiety and stress awareness of university students who are attending a science course during examinations. Real-time anxiety awareness as provided by biofeedback during science exams in an academic environment is shown to have a positive effect on the anxiety students experience and on their self-efficacy regarding examinations. Furthermore, the relevant research identifies a significant relationship between the students' anxiety level and their performance. Finally, the current study indicates that the students' anxiety awareness as provided by biofeedback is related to their performance, a relationship that is mediated and explained by the students' anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4200619190,"Using an outcome expectancy framework, this research sought to understand sex differences in the underlying beliefs that influence harassment perception. One hundred and ninety-six participants (52% women) read a series of vignettes depicting common examples of digital male-on-female sexual harassment. They were asked to what extent they thought each scenario constituted sexual harassment, and how likely the perpetrator would experience positive and negative outcomes. Consistent with predictions, women were more likely to consider the behaviours as harassment than men were. Both sexes harassment perceptions had significant relationships with their outcome expectancies, but we also found evidence of a sex specific moderation; the link between men's negative outcome expectancies was moderated by their positive ones. The results suggest that perceptions of harassment may have sexually asymmetrical underpinnings. Measuring the interplay between positive and negative outcome expectancies in relation to sexual harassment perception is a novel approach, that may have implications for the development of anti-sexual harassment interventions. Implications for theory and future research directions are discussed."
