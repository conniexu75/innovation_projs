https://openalex.org/W2767040741,"Deep learning emerges as a powerful tool for analyzing medical images. Retinal disease detection by using computer-aided diagnosis from fundus image has emerged as a new method. We applied deep learning convolutional neural network by using MatConvNet for an automated detection of multiple retinal diseases with fundus photographs involved in STructured Analysis of the REtina (STARE) database. Dataset was built by expanding data on 10 categories, including normal retina and nine retinal diseases. The optimal outcomes were acquired by using a random forest transfer learning based on VGG-19 architecture. The classification results depended greatly on the number of categories. As the number of categories increased, the performance of deep learning models was diminished. When all 10 categories were included, we obtained results with an accuracy of 30.5%, relative classifier information (RCI) of 0.052, and Cohen’s kappa of 0.224. Considering three integrated normal, background diabetic retinopathy, and dry age-related macular degeneration, the multi-categorical classifier showed accuracy of 72.8%, 0.283 RCI, and 0.577 kappa. In addition, several ensemble classifiers enhanced the multi-categorical classification performance. The transfer learning incorporated with ensemble classifier of clustering and voting approach presented the best performance with accuracy of 36.7%, 0.053 RCI, and 0.225 kappa in the 10 retinal diseases classification problem. First, due to the small size of datasets, the deep learning techniques in this study were ineffective to be applied in clinics where numerous patients suffering from various types of retinal disorders visit for diagnosis and treatment. Second, we found that the transfer learning incorporated with ensemble classifiers can improve the classification performance in order to detect multi-categorical retinal diseases. Further studies should confirm the effectiveness of algorithms with large datasets obtained from hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2765418150,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) refers to one of the major detoxifying enzymes that plays an important role in different abiotic and biotic stress modulation pathways of plant. The present study aimed to a comprehensive genome-wide functional characterization of GST genes and proteins in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). The whole genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of 90 GST genes in tomato, the largest GST gene family reported till date. Eight segmental duplicated gene pairs might contribute significantly to the expansion of SlGST gene family. Based on phylogenetic analysis of tomato, rice, and Arabidopsis GST proteins, GST family members could be further divided into ten classes. Members of each orthologous class showed high conservancy among themselves. Tau and lambda are the major classes of tomato; while tau and phi are the major classes for rice and Arabidopsis. Chromosomal localization revealed highly uneven distribution of SlGST genes in 13 different chromosomes, where chromosome 9 possessed the highest number of genes. Based on publicly available microarray data, expression analysis of 30 available SlGST genes exhibited a differential pattern in all the analyzed tissues and developmental stages. Moreover, most of the members showed highly induced expression in response to multiple biotic and abiotic stress inducers that could be harmonized with the increase in total GST enzyme activity under several stress conditions. Activity of tomato GST could be enhanced further by using some positive modulators (safeners) that have been predicted through molecular docking of SlGSTU5 and ligands. Moreover, tomato GST proteins are predicted to interact with a lot of other glutathione synthesizing and utilizing enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione synthetase and γ-glutamyltransferase. This comprehensive genome-wide analysis and expression profiling would provide a rational platform and possibility to explore the versatile role of GST genes in crop engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2766914792,"Objectives Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are individually considered as important contributors to endothelial dysfunction in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their interactions in coronary arteriole endothelial dysfunction are uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of TNF-α and IL-6 interactions on coronary endothelial dysfunction in experimental T2D. Methods The studies used wild type (WT), diabetic mice (db/db), db/db null for TNF (dbTNF-/dbTNF-), and db/db mice treated with neutralizing antibody to IL-6 (anti-IL-6). Endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine [ACh], or luminal flow-induced shear stress) and endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside [SNP]) vasodilation of isolated and pressurized coronary arterioles were determined. Quantitative PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining were utilized for mechanistic studies. Results Relative to WT, arteriolar dilation to both ACh and flow was attenuated in db/db mice and dbTNF-/dbTNF-. Treatment of dbTNF-/dbTNF- and db/db mice with anti-IL-6 improved arteriolar dilation compared to db/db mice. Immunofluorescence staining illustrated localization of IL-6 within the endothelial cells of coronary arterioles. In db/db mice, mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 and superoxide (O2-) production were higher, but reduced by anti-IL-6 treatment. Also, in db/db mice, mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α suppressed by the anti-IL-6 treatment and the reduced expression of mRNA and protein expression of IL-6 by the genetic deletion of TNF-α both supported a reciprocal regulation between TNF-α and IL-6. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression and phosphorylation of eNOS (p-eNOS/eNOS) were lower in db/db mice coronary arterioles and were restored in db/db+Anti-IL-6 and dbTNF-/dbTNF- mice. Conclusion The interactions between TNF-α and IL-6 exacerbate oxidative stress and reduce phosphorylation of eNOS, thereby contributing to coronary endothelial dysfunction in T2D mice."
https://openalex.org/W2765227970,"Wildlife corridors can help maintain landscape connectivity but novel methods must be developed to assess regional structural connectivity quickly and cheaply so as to determine where expensive and time-consuming surveys of functional connectivity should occur. We use least-cost methods, the most accurate and up-to-date land conversion dataset for East Africa, and interview data on wildlife corridors, to develop a single, consistent methodology to systematically assess wildlife corridors at a national scale using Tanzania as a case study. Our research aimed to answer the following questions; (i) which corridors may still remain open (i.e. structurally connected) at a national scale, (ii) which have been potentially severed by anthropogenic land conversion (e.g., agriculture and settlements), (iii) where are other remaining potential wildlife corridors located, and (iv) which protected areas with lower forms of protection (e.g., Forest Reserves and Wildlife Management Areas) may act as stepping-stones linking more than one National Park and/or Game Reserve. We identify a total of 52 structural connections between protected areas that are potentially open to wildlife movement, and in so doing add 23 to those initially identified by other methods in Tanzanian Government reports. We find that the vast majority of corridors noted in earlier reports as ""likely to be severed"" have actually not been cut structurally (21 of 24). Nonetheless, nearly a sixth of all the wildlife corridors identified in Tanzania in 2009 have potentially been separated by land conversion, and a third now pass across lands likely to be converted to human use in the near future. Our study uncovers two reserves with lower forms of protection (Uvinza Forest Reserve in the west and Wami-Mbiki Wildlife Management Area in the east) that act as apparently crucial stepping-stones between National Parks and/or Game Reserves and therefore require far more serious conservation support. Methods used in this study are readily applicable to other nations lacking detailed data on wildlife movements and plagued by inaccurate land cover datasets. Our results are the first step in identifying wildlife corridors at a regional scale and provide a springboard for ground-based follow-up conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2766153340,"Background Close contact between pets and owners provides the opportunity for transmission of antimicrobial resistant organisms like extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, posing a risk to public health. Objectives To investigate whether raw feed is a risk factor for household cats to shed ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, a cohort study was designed. Additionally, raw and non-raw commercial pet food products were screened for the presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Methods Weekly fecal samples of 17 cats in the control group and 19 cats in the exposed group were collected for three weeks and analyzed for the presence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Questionnaires were obtained to determine additional risk factors. Fecal samples were cultured on MacConkey agar supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime. PCR and sequence analysis was used for screening for ESBL genes in suspected isolates. Pet food samples were cultured in LB broth supplemented with 1 mg/L cefotaxime and processed as described above. Results In the cohort study, ESBL-producing bacteria were isolated from 3 of 51 (5.9%) samples in the control group compared to 37 of 57 (89.5%) samples in the exposed group. A significant association was found between ESBL shedding and feeding raw pet food products (OR = 31.5). No other risk factors were identified in this study. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 14 of 18 (77.8%) raw pet food products and 0 of 35 non-raw pet food products. Conclusions This study shows a strong association between shedding of ESBL-producing bacteria in household cats and feeding raw pet food. Raw pet food was often contaminated with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2766748881,"Being determined by human social behaviour, pedestrian group dynamics depends on ""intrinsic properties"" of the group such as the purpose of the pedestrians, their personal relation, their gender, age, and body size. In this work we quantitatively study the dynamical properties of pedestrian dyads by analysing a large data set of automatically tracked pedestrian trajectories in an unconstrained ""ecological"" setting (a shopping mall), whose relational group properties have been coded by three different human observers. We observed that females walk slower and closer than males, that workers walk faster, at a larger distance and more abreast than leisure oriented people, and that inter group relation has a strong effect on group structure, with couples walking very close and abreast, colleagues walking at a larger distance, and friends walking more abreast than family members. Pedestrian height (obtained automatically through our tracking system) influences velocity and abreast distance, both growing functions of the average group height. Results regarding pedestrian age show as expected that elderly people walk slowly, while active age adults walk at the maximum velocity. Groups with children have a strong tendency to walk in a non abreast formation, with a large distance (despite a low abreast distance). A cross-analysis of the interplay between these intrinsic features, taking in account also the effect of extrinsic crowd density, confirms these major effects but reveals also a richer structure. An interesting and unexpected result, for example, is that the velocity of groups with children {\it increases} with density, at least in the low-medium density range found under normal conditions in shopping malls. Children also appear to behave differently according to the gender of the parent."
https://openalex.org/W2766373581,"Interferon gamma release assays like Quantiferon Gold In-Tube (QFT) are used to identify individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A dichotomous cut-off (0.35 IU/ml) defines a positive QFT without considering test variability. Our objective was to evaluate the introduction of a borderline range under routine conditions.Results of routine QFT samples from Sweden (2009-2014) were collected. A borderline range (0.20-0.99 IU/ml) was introduced in 2010 recommending a follow-up sample. The association between borderline results and incident active TB within 3 to 24 months was investigated through linkage with the national TB-register.Using the recommended QFT cut-off, 75.1% tests were negative, 21.4% positive and 3.5% indeterminate. In total, 9% (3656/40773) were within the borderline range. In follow-up samples, individuals with initial results between 0.20-0.34 IU/ml and 0.35-0.99 IU/ml displayed negative results below the borderline range (<0.20 IU/ml) in 66.1% (230/348) and 42.5% (285/671) respectively, and none developed incident TB. Among 6712 individuals with a positive initial test >0.99 IU/ml, 65 (0.97%) developed incident TB within 3-24 months.We recommend retesting of subjects with QFT results in the range 0.20-0.99 IU/ml to enhance reliability and validity of the test. Half of the subjects in the borderline range will be negative at a level <0.20 IU/ml when retested and have a very low risk of developing incident active TB."
https://openalex.org/W2766586532,"Background Historically, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) caused large meningitis epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, Burkina Faso became the first country to implement a national meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (MACV) campaign. We analyzed nationwide meningitis surveillance data from Burkina Faso for the 5 years following MACV introduction. Methods We examined Burkina Faso’s aggregate reporting and national laboratory-confirmed case-based meningitis surveillance data from 2011–2015. We calculated incidence (cases per 100,000 persons), and described reported NmA cases. Results In 2011–2015, Burkina Faso reported 20,389 cases of suspected meningitis. A quarter (4,503) of suspected meningitis cases with cerebrospinal fluid specimens were laboratory-confirmed as either S. pneumoniae (57%), N. meningitidis (40%), or H. influenzae (2%). Average adjusted annual national incidence of meningococcal meningitis was 3.8 (range: 2.0–10.2 annually) and was highest among infants aged <1 year (8.4). N. meningitidis serogroup W caused the majority (64%) of meningococcal meningitis among all age groups. Only six confirmed NmA cases were reported in 2011–2015. Five cases were in children who were too young (n = 2) or otherwise not vaccinated (n = 3) during the 2010 MACV mass vaccination campaign; one case had documented MACV receipt, representing the first documented MACV failure. Conclusions Meningococcal meningitis incidence in Burkina Faso remains relatively low following MACV introduction. However, a substantial burden remains and NmA transmission has persisted. MACV integration into routine childhood immunization programs is essential to ensure continued protection."
https://openalex.org/W2766399118,"To compare the vaginal microbiota of women engaged in high-risk sexual behaviour (sex work) with women who are not engaged in high-risk sexual behaviour. Diverse vaginal microbiota, low in Lactobacillus species, like those in bacterial vaginosis (BV), are associated with increased prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. Although high-risk sexual behaviour increases risk for STIs, the vaginal microbiota of sex workers is understudied.A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted comparing vaginal microbiota of women who are not engaged in sex work (non-sex worker controls, NSW, N = 19) and women engaged in sex work (female sex workers, FSW, N = 48), using Illumina sequencing (16S rRNA, V3 region).Bacterial richness and diversity were significantly less in controls, than FSW. Controls were more likely to have Lactobacillus as the most abundant genus (58% vs. 17%; P = 0.002) and composition of their vaginal microbiota differed from FSW (PERMANOVA, P = 0.001). Six microbiota clusters were detected, including a high diversity cluster with three sub-clusters, and 55% of women with low Nugent Scores fell within this cluster. High diversity was observed by 16S sequencing in FSW, regardless of Nugent Scores, suggesting that Nugent Score may not be capable of capturing the diversity present in the FSW vaginal microbiota.High-risk sexual behaviour is associated with diversity of the vaginal microbiota and lack of Lactobacillus. These factors could contribute to increased risk of STIs and HIV in women engaged in high-risk sexual behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2766141113,"Purpose To evaluate the long-term efficacy of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction and complications of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) implantation in patients with refractory glaucoma. Design Retrospective study. Subjects The study involved 302 refractory glaucoma patients who underwent AGV implantation and had a minimum follow-up of 6 months between March 1995 and December 2013. Methods An operation was defined as successful when (1) the postoperative IOP remained between 5 and 21 mmHg and was reduced 30% compared to the baseline IOP with or without medication, (2) there was no loss of light perception or vision-threatening severe complications, and (3) no additional filtering or aqueous drainage surgery was required. Clinical records were reviewed. Main outcome measures IOP, anti-glaucoma medications, and complications Results The mean follow-up period was 62.25 months (range, 6 to 190 months). The cumulative probability of success was 89% at 6 months, 81% at 1 year, 66% at 3 years, 44% at 10 years, and 26% at 15 years. IOP was reduced from a mean of 32.2 ± 10.5 mmHg to 18.6 ± 9.1 mmHg at 1 month, 15.2 ± 7.0 mmHg at 6 months, and 14.2 ± 3.5 mmHg at 15 years. Surgical failures were significantly increased when preoperative IOP was high, and when severe complications occurred after AGV implantation (P < 0.05). Conclusion AGV implantation was successful for IOP control in patients with refractive glaucoma in the long term. However, the success rate of surgery decreased over time. Preoperative high IOP and severe complications related to the operation were significant risk factors for failure."
https://openalex.org/W2766358153,"Few studies have examined the trajectories of symptom severity in first episode psychosis (FEP) and their impact on functioning. This study aimed to identify discrete trajectories of positive, negative and general psychopathological symptoms and functioning, determine predictors of the identified symptom trajectories and subsequently investigate the relationship between symptom and functioning trajectories over the 2-year follow-up period.Data were extracted from the Singapore Early Psychosis Intervention Programme clinical database. Trajectories of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale over the two-year follow up were modelled using latent class growth curve modelling.Two distinct trajectories (early response and stable trajectory and delayed response trajectory) for positive symptoms, four distinct trajectories (early response and stable trajectory, early response and relapse trajectory, slower response and no response trajectory and delayed response trajectory) for negative and general psychopathology symptoms and three distinct trajectories for functioning (high functioning trajectory, moderately stable functioning trajectory and deterioration in functioning trajectory) were identified in our sample. Compared to individuals in the early response and stable trajectory, those in the delayed response trajectory for positive and negative symptoms, early response and relapse for negative and general psychopathology symptoms and slower response and no response trajectories for general psychopathology symptoms were significantly associated with higher odds of having deterioration in functioning over time. Poor symptom trajectories were also significantly predicted by younger age, male gender, unemployed and economically inactive status, lower education, longer duration of untreated psychosis and diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum and delusional disorders.The results confirm that the symptoms trajectories among patients with FEP are heterogeneous and suggest that a small group of patients may be at higher risk of deterioration in symptom severity and functioning over the 2-year follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2766725239,"In this work, gene expression in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is analyzed with the goal of selecting the most attributed genes and performing classification. The objective was achieved by utilizing a combination of various statistical filters and a wrapper-based geometric binary particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (GBPSO-SVM) algorithm. The utilization of different filters was accentuated by incorporating a mean and median ratio criterion to remove very similar genes. The results showed that the most discriminative genes that were identified in the first and last selection steps included the presence of a repetitive gene (CAPS2), which was assigned as the gene most highly related to ASD risk. The merged gene subset that was selected by the GBPSO-SVM algorithm was able to enhance the classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2766138663,"In China, food safety problems have occurred frequently in the past ten years, causing great concern for the public. Adolescents, with higher exposure to problematic food, represent a unique target for interventions aimed at risk reduction. To understand their food safety knowledge, attitude and practice, a cross-sectional survey using paper questionnaire was carried out among 4,220 students (median age of 14 years, 50.3% females) from nine secondary schools in 3 districts of Beijing. The findings showed that the majority of respondents (42.0%) had a high knowledge level. Significant association was found between food safety knowledge score (median = 11, IQR:9-13) and demographic characteristics of region, school type, residence type, habit of smoking and alcohol use, academic record and parents' education background. In terms of attitude and practice, only 17% of those surveyed regarded China's food safety situation as good, 53.6% regarded it as worrying; almost all students (96.5%) did pay attention to food safety; 95.3% of the students had worried about the safety of the food provided by the small restaurants and street peddlers, but in reality, as many as 69.4% often or occasionally bought food from peddlers around their campuses and nearly half continued the consumption of such food in spite of worrying about its safety problems. Overall, the food safety knowledge among Beijing secondary school students was relatively good. They did not show much confidence in the country's food safety situation, but many aware of the safety issues did not bother to change or take action. The study suggests that more systematic and targeted education on food safety is necessary for this age group."
https://openalex.org/W2765744990,"Cryopreservation is known for its marked deleterious effects on embryonic health. Bovine compact morulae were vitrified or slow-frozen, and post-warm morulae were cultured to the expanded blastocyst stage. Blastocysts developed from vitrified and slow-frozen morulae were subjected to microarray analysis and compared with blastocysts developed from unfrozen control morulae for differential gene expression. Morula to blastocyst conversion rate was higher (P < 0.05) in control (72%) and vitrified (77%) than in slow-frozen (34%) morulae. Total 20 genes were upregulated and 44 genes were downregulated in blastocysts developed from vitrified morulae (fold change ≥ ± 2, P < 0.05) in comparison with blastocysts developed from control morulae. In blastocysts developed from slow-frozen morulae, 102 genes were upregulated and 63 genes were downregulated (fold change ≥ ± 1.5, P < 0.05). Blastocysts developed from vitrified morulae exhibited significant changes in gene expression mainly involving embryo implantation (PTGS2, CALB1), lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species generation (HSD3B1, AKR1B1, APOA1) and cell differentiation (KRT19, CLDN23). However, blastocysts developed from slow-frozen morulae showed changes in the expression of genes related to cell signaling (SPP1), cell structure and differentiation (DCLK2, JAM2 and VIM), and lipid metabolism (PLA2R1 and SMPD3). In silico comparison between blastocysts developed form vitrified and slow-frozen morulae revealed similar changes in gene expression as between blastocysts developed from vitrified and control morulae. In conclusion, blastocysts developed form vitrified morulae demonstrated better post-warming survival than blastocysts developed from slow-frozen morulae but their gene expression related to lipid metabolism, steroidogenesis, cell differentiation and placentation changed significantly (≥ 2 fold). Slow freezing method killed more morulae than vitrification but those which survived up to blastocyst stage did not express ≥ 2 fold change in their gene expression as compared with blastocysts from control morulae."
https://openalex.org/W2766494992,"Financial crises inflict significant human as well as economic hardship. This paper focuses on the human fallout of capital market stress. Financial stress-induced behavioral changes can manifest in higher suicide and murder-suicide rates. We find that these rates also correlate with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate (negatively associated; a -0.25% drop [in the rate of change in annual suicides for a +1% change in the independent variable]), unemployment rate (positive link; 0.298% increase), inflation rate (positive link; 0.169% increase in suicide rate levels) and stock market returns adjusted for the risk-free T-Bill rate (negative link; -0.047% drop). Suicides tend to rise during periods of economic turmoil, such as the recent Great Recession of 2008. An analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data of more than 2 million non-natural deaths in the US since 1980 reveals a positive correlation with unemployment levels. We find that suicides and murder-suicides associated with adverse market sentiment lag the initial stressor by up to two years, thus opening a policy window for government/public health intervention to reduce these negative outcomes. Both our models explain about 73 to 76% of the variance in suicide rates and rate of change in suicide rates, and deploy a total of four widely available independent variables (lagged and/or transformed). The results are invariant to the inclusion/exclusion of 2008 data over the 1980-2016 time series, the period of our study. The disconnect between rational decision making, induced by cognitive dissonance and severe financial stress can lead to suboptimal outcomes, not only in the area of investing, but in a direct loss of human capital. No economic system can afford such losses. Finance journal articles focus on monetary alpha, which is the return on a portfolio in excess of the benchmark; we think it is important to be aware of the loss of human capital as a consequence of market instability. This study makes one such an attempt."
https://openalex.org/W2765571443,"Adolescence is a unique developmental period, characterized by physical and emotional growth and significant maturation of cognitive and social skills. For individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it is also a vulnerable period as cognitive and social skills can deteriorate. Circumscribed interests (CIs), idiosyncratic areas of intense interest and focus, are a core symptom of ASD that may be associated with social development. Yet, relatively little is known about the expression of CIs in adolescents with ASD. Many studies investigating CIs have used images depicting items of special interest; however, it is not clear how images should be customized for adolescent studies. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the types of images that may be appropriate for studies of CIs in adolescents with ASD. To this end, we used a mixed methods design that included, 1) one-on-one interviews with 10 adolescents (4 with ASD and 6 TD), to identify categories of images that were High Autism Interest (‘HAI’) or High Typically Developing Interest (‘HTD’), and 2) an online survey taken by fifty-three adolescents with ASD (42 male) and 135 typically developing (TD) adolescents (55 male) who rated how much they liked 105 ‘HAI’ and ‘HTD’ images. Although we found a significant interaction between ‘HAI’ and ‘HTD’ categories and diagnosis, neither group significantly preferred one category over the other, and only one individual category ('Celebrities') showed a significant group effect, favored by TD adolescents. Males significantly preferred ‘HAI’ images relative to females, and TD adolescents significantly preferred images with social content relative to adolescents with ASD. Our findings suggest that studies investigating affective or neural responses to CI-related stimuli in adolescents should consider that stereotypical ASD interests (e.g. trains, gadgets) may not accurately represent individual adolescents with ASD, many of whom show interests that overlap with TD adolescents (e.g. video games)."
https://openalex.org/W2765575890,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle wasting disease manifested in young boys, for which there is no current cure. We have shown that the amino acid taurine is safe and effective at preventing dystropathology in the mdx mouse model for DMD. This study aimed to establish if treating growing mdx mice with a higher dose of taurine was more effective at improving strength and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Mice were treated with a dose of taurine estimated to be 16 g/kg/day, in drinking water from 1-6 weeks of age, after which in vivo and ex vivo muscle strength was assessed, as were measures of inflammation, oxidative stress and taurine metabolism. While the dose did decrease inflammation and protein oxidation in dystrophic muscles, there was no improvement in muscle strength (in contrast with benefits observed with the lower dose) and growth of the young mice was significantly restricted. We present novel data that a high taurine dose increases the cysteine content of both mdx liver and plasma, a possible result of down regulation of the taurine synthesis pathway in the liver (which functions to dispose of excess cysteine, which is toxic). These data caution that a high dose of taurine can have adverse effects and may be less efficacious than lower taurine doses. Therefore, monitoring of taurine dosage needs to be considered in future pre-clinical trials, in anticipation of using taurine as a clinical therapy for growing DMD boys (and other conditions)."
https://openalex.org/W2765697781,"Ceramide is a key compound in sphingolipid metabolism. Dynamics of ceramide synthesis is important in the several biological processes, such as induction of apoptosis or insulin resistance. So far, its de novo synthesis rate was evaluated indirectly, based on the content of the compound, its intermediates and the activity of respective enzymes. The aim of the present study was to directly measure ceramide synthesis rate (FSR) in different muscle types under varied plasma FFA supply in rat with the use of [U-13C] palmitate tracer and LC/MS/MS. The experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats, divided into three groups: 1-control, 2-with elevated plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration by means of intralipid and heparin, 3-with reduced plasma FFA concentration by means of nicotinic acid. The stable plasma FFA concentration and plasma [U-13C] palmitate enrichment was maintained for two hours by simultaneous infusion of the tracer and the respective compounds. At the end of the experiment, samples of blood from the abdominal aorta, the heart, diaphragm, soleus and white section of the gastrocnemius were taken. Muscle sphinganine, sphingosine and ceramide content and enrichment and plasma palmitate enrichment was measured with the use of LC/MS/MS. Plasma FFA concentration and composition was measured by means of gas-liquid chromatography. Under basal conditions ceramide FSR in the heart and the diaphragm was higher than in the soleus and the white gastrocnemius. Elevation in the plasma FFA concentration increased the FSR and ceramide content in each muscle, which correlated with increased HOMA-IR. The highest FSR was noted in the heart. Reduction in the plasma FFA concentration decreased ceramide FSR in each muscle type, which was accompanied by marked reduction in HOMA-IR. It is concluded that ceramide FSR depends on both the muscle type and the plasma FFA supply and is correlated with whole body insulin sensitivity under varying plasma FFA supply."
https://openalex.org/W2765928105,"Background Invasive off- or on-pump cardiac surgery (elective and emergency procedures, excluding transplants are routinely performed to treat complications of ischaemic heart disease. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in the setting of cardiac surgery. However, the impact of RCTs is weakened by heterogeneity in outcome measuring and reporting, which hinders comparison across trials. Core outcome sets (COS, a set of outcomes that should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in clinical trials for a specific clinical field) help reduce this problem. In light of the above, we developed a COS for cardiac surgery effectiveness trials. Methods Potential core outcomes were identified a priori by analysing data on 371 RCTs of 58,253 patients. We reached consensus on core outcomes in an international three-round eDelphi exercise. Outcomes for which at least 60% of the participants chose the response option “no” and less than 20% chose the response option “yes” were excluded. Results Eighty-six participants from 23 different countries involving adult cardiac patients, cardiac surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nursing staff and researchers contributed to this eDelphi. The panel reached consensus on four core outcomes: 1) Measure of mortality, 2) Measure of quality of life, 3) Measure of hospitalisation and 4) Measure of cerebrovascular complication to be included in adult cardiac surgery trials. Conclusion This study used robust research methodology to develop a minimum core outcome set for clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in the setting of cardiac surgery. As a next step, appropriate outcome measurement instruments have to be selected."
https://openalex.org/W2766285558,"Beta diversity, the spatial variation in species composition, has been related to different explanatory variables, including environmental heterogeneity, productivity and connectivity. Using a long-term time series of zooplankton data collected over 62 months in a tropical reservoir (Ribeirão das Lajes Reservoir, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil), we tested whether beta diversity (as measured across six sites distributed along the main axis of the reservoir) was correlated with environmental heterogeneity (spatial environmental variation in a given month), chlorophyll-a concentration (a surrogate for productivity) and water level. We did not found evidence for the role of these predictors, suggesting the need to reevaluate predictions or at least to search for better surrogates of the processes that hypothetically control beta diversity variation. However, beta diversity declined over time, which is consistent with the process of biotic homogenization, a worldwide cause of concern."

We evaluated the lethal and sublethal toxicity upon N. tenuis adults of label doses of three insecticides (pyriproxyfen, spirotetramat, cypermethrin) and seven fungicides (benomyl, chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride, cyazofamid, fluopicolide + propamocarb hydrochloride (FPH), penconazol, trifloxystrobin) commonly used in various crops. Two exposure routes were tested: (i) contact with dry residues of insecticides or fungicides on tomato sprouts and (ii) multiple exposure to these chemicals via topical sprays on adults which foraged on treated sprouts; and fed on treated eggs of Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) simultaneously. Mortality and reproductive capacity were investigated as indicators of lethal and sublethal effects on N. tenius. The tested insecticides and fungicides were all classified as harmless when predator was exposed only to the dry residues of each. However, the multiple exposure to either cypermethrin, benomyl, chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or trifloxystrobin caused significant mortality of N. tenuis adults. Cypermethrin also significantly reduced its reproductive capacity. Interestingly, N. tenuis produced a higher number of progeny when exposed to fungicides penconazol and FPH in both exposure scenarios. Overall, findings suggest that the two insecticides, pyriproxyfen and spirotetramat but not cypermethrin, and all tested fungicides can be considered compatible with N. tenuis."
https://openalex.org/W2765134864,"Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a dominant member of the human intestinal microbiome. The genome of this anaerobe encodes more than 100 proteolytic enzymes, the majority of which have not been characterized. In the present study, we have produced and purified recombinant dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III) from B. thetaiotaomicron for the purposes of biochemical and structural investigations. DPP III is a cytosolic zinc-metallopeptidase of the M49 family, involved in protein metabolism. The biochemical results for B. thetaiotaomicron DPP III from our research showed both some similarities to, as well as certain differences from, previously characterised yeast and human DPP III. The 3D-structure of B. thetaiotaomicron DPP III was determined by X-ray crystallography and revealed a two-domain protein. The ligand-free structure (refined to 2.4 Å) was in the open conformation, while in the presence of the hydroxamate inhibitor Tyr-Phe-NHOH, the closed form (refined to 3.3 Å) was observed. Compared to the closed form, the two domains of the open form are rotated away from each other by about 28 degrees. A comparison of the crystal structure of B. thetaiotaomicron DPP III with that of the human and yeast enzymes revealed a similar overall fold. However, a significant difference with functional implications was discovered in the upper domain, farther away from the catalytic centre. In addition, our data indicate that large protein flexibility might be conserved in the M49 family."
https://openalex.org/W2765863342,"This study aimed to investigate abnormalities in structural covariance network constructed from gray matter volume in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients by using graph theoretical analysis for further clarification of the underlying mechanisms of central nervous system involvement. Twenty-eight DM1 patients (4 childhood onset, 10 juvenile onset, 14 adult onset), excluding three cases from 31 consecutive patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging in a certain period, and 28 age- and sex- matched healthy control subjects were included in this study. The normalized gray matter images of both groups were subjected to voxel based morphometry (VBM) and Graph Analysis Toolbox for graph theoretical analysis. VBM revealed extensive gray matter atrophy in DM1 patients, including cortical and subcortical structures. On graph theoretical analysis, there were no significant differences between DM1 and control groups in terms of the global measures of connectivity. Betweenness centrality was increased in several regions including the left fusiform gyrus, whereas it was decreased in the right striatum. The absence of significant differences between the groups in global network measurements on graph theoretical analysis is consistent with the fact that the general cognitive function is preserved in DM1 patients. In DM1 patients, increased connectivity in the left fusiform gyrus and decreased connectivity in the right striatum might be associated with impairment in face perception and theory of mind, and schizotypal-paranoid personality traits, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2766303495,"We used a bone marrow transplantation approach to distinguish the activities of bone marrow-derived macrophages from the activities of central nervous system-resident microglia in phenomena associated with axon demyelination and remyelination. We transplanted wild type or germline NG2 null beta-actin-EGFP expressing bone marrow into irradiated wild type or NG2 null recipient mice, followed by analysis of lysolecithin-induced spinal cord demyelination and remyelination and quantification of Iba-1+/ F4/80+/ EGFP+ macrophages and Iba-1+/ F4/80+/ EGFP- microglia. One week after microinjection of 1% lysolecithin into the spinal cord, wild type recipients receiving NG2 null bone marrow exhibit greatly reduced infiltration of macrophages into lesions, compared to wild type recipients receiving wild type bone marrow. Wild type bone marrow recipients also exhibit larger numbers of demyelinated axons than NG2 null recipients, indicative of macrophage participation in the initial myelin damage. However, wild type bone marrow recipients also exhibit superior myelin repair at 6 weeks post-injury, compared to NG2 null bone marrow recipients, demonstrating the additional importance of macrophages in remyelination. Incompletely repaired lesions in NG2 null bone marrow recipients at 6 weeks post-injury retain elevated numbers of macrophages, in contrast to lower numbers of macrophages in more completely repaired lesions in wild type bone marrow recipients. This suggests that NG2 expression renders macrophages more effective in myelin repair and less likely to promote chronic inflammation. Effective macrophage involvement in myelin repair is due in part to effects on the proliferation and/or recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Reduced numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitors are seen in lesions in NG2 null bone marrow recipients, likely due to deficits in macrophage production of oligodendrocyte progenitor-relevant mitogens and in phagocytosis of inhibitory myelin debris. Microglia also appear to be important for clearance of myelin debris, as indicated by reduced phagocytosis in NG2 null recipients receiving wild type bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2766776417,"Medical image processing has become a major player in the world of automatic tumour region detection and is tantamount to the incipient stages of computer aided design. Saliency detection is a crucial application of medical image processing, and serves in its potential aid to medical practitioners by making the affected area stand out in the foreground from the rest of the background image. The algorithm developed here is a new approach to the detection of saliency in a three dimensional multi channel MR image sequence for the glioblastoma multiforme (a form of malignant brain tumour). First we enhance the three channels, FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery), T2 and T1C (contrast enhanced with gadolinium) to generate a pseudo coloured RGB image. This is then converted to the CIE L*a*b* color space. Processing on cubes of sizes k = 4, 8, 16, the L*a*b* 3D image is then compressed into volumetric units; each representing the neighbourhood information of the surrounding 64 voxels for k = 4, 512 voxels for k = 8 and 4096 voxels for k = 16, respectively. The spatial distance of these voxels are then compared along the three major axes to generate the novel 3D saliency map of a 3D image, which unambiguously highlights the tumour region. The algorithm operates along the three major axes to maximise the computation efficiency while minimising loss of valuable 3D information. Thus the 3D multichannel MR image saliency detection algorithm is useful in generating a uniform and logistically correct 3D saliency map with pragmatic applicability in Computer Aided Detection (CADe). Assignment of uniform importance to all three axes proves to be an important factor in volumetric processing, which helps in noise reduction and reduces the possibility of compromising essential information. The effectiveness of the algorithm was evaluated over the BRATS MICCAI 2015 dataset having 274 glioma cases, consisting both of high grade and low grade GBM. The results were compared with that of the 2D saliency detection algorithm taken over the entire sequence of brain data. For all comparisons, the Area Under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) has been found to be more than 0.99 ± 0.01 over various tumour types, structures and locations."
https://openalex.org/W2766863101,"The segmental pattern of the vertebrate body is established via the periodic formation of somites from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). This periodical process is controlled by the cyclic and synchronized activation of Notch signaling in the PSM. Protein O-fucosyltransferase1 (Pofut1), which transfers O-fucose to the EGF domains of the Notch1 receptor, is indispensable for Notch signaling activation. The Drosophila homologue Ofut1 was reported to control Notch localization via two different mechanisms, working as a chaperone for Notch or as a regulator of Notch endocytosis. However, these were found to be independent of O-fucosyltransferase activity because the phenotypes were rescued by Ofut1 mutants lacking O-fucosyltransferase activity. Pofut1 may also be involved in the Notch receptor localization in mice. However, the contribution of enzymatic activity of Pofut1 to the Notch receptor dynamics remains to be elucidated. In order to clarify the importance of the O-fucosyltransferase activity of Pofut1 for Notch signaling activation and the protein localization in the PSM, we established mice carrying point mutations at the 245th a.a. or 370-372th a.a., highly conserved amino-acid sequences whose mutations disrupt the O-fucosyltransferase activity of both Drosophila Ofut1 and mammalian Pofut1, with the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome-engineering technique. Both mutants displayed the same severely perturbed somite formation and Notch1 subcellular localization defects as the Pofut1 null mutants. In the mutants, Pofut1 protein, but not RNA, became undetectable by E9.5. Furthermore, both wild-type and mutant Pofut1 proteins were degraded through lysosome dependent machinery. Pofut1 protein loss in the point mutant embryos caused the same phenotypes as those observed in Pofut1 null embryos."

One of the enzymes of this pathway is the heterooctameric mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP), composed of four α- and β-subunits. Mutations in MTP genes (HADHA and HADHB), both located on chromosome 2p23, cause MTP deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by decreased activity of MTP. The most common MTP mutation is long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency caused by the c.1528G>C (rs137852769, p.Glu510Gln) substitution in exon 15 of the HADHA gene. Subjects/Methods We analyzed the frequency of genetic variants in the HADHA gene in the adults of Kashubian origin from North Poland and compared this data in other Polish provinces. Results We found a significantly higher frequency of HDHA c.1528G>C (rs137852769, p.Glu510Gln) carriers among Kashubians (1/57) compared to subjects from other regions of Poland (1/187). We found higher frequency of c.652G>C (rs71441018, pVal218Leu) polymorphism in the HADHA gene within population of Silesia, southern Poland (1/107) compared to other regions.

Nevertheless, no studies have investigated whether tinnitus is associated with a higher risk of ICVD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of ICVD among young and middle-aged patients with tinnitus. Methods Using the Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 3,474 patients 20–45 years old with incident ICVD diagnosed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010 and 17,370 controls, frequency matched on age interval, sex, and year of the index date. Risk of ICVD associated with tinnitus was assessed using multiple logistic regression analyses. Results Tinnitus was significantly associated with a higher risk of incident ICVD among young and middle-aged patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34–2.04), adjusting for sex, age, and comorbidities. In addition, sex-stratified analysis showed that the associations were significant in both male (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.16–2.07) and female patients (adjusted OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.30–2.41). Furthermore, tinnitus was significantly associated with a higher risk of ICVD in the 20.0–29.9 years (adjusted OR 4.11, 95% CI 1.98–8.52) and 30.0–39.9 years (adjusted OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.57–3.05) age groups, but not in the 40.0–45.0 years age group. Conclusions Tinnitus could be a novel risk factor or clinical indicator for young ischemic stroke, and further investigations are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2765903255,"All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) inhibits adipogenesis in established preadipocyte cell lines. Dosing pharmacological amounts of RA reduces weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet, i.e. counteracts diet-induced obesity (DIO). The aldehyde dehydrogenase Raldh1 (Aldh1a1) functions as one of three enzymes that converts the retinol metabolite retinal into RA, and one of many proteins that contribute to RA homeostasis. Female Raldh1-ablated mice resist DIO. This phenotype contrasts with ablations of other enzymes and binding-proteins that maintain RA homeostasis, which gain adiposity. The phenotype observed prompted the conclusion that loss of Raldh1 causes an increase in adipose tissue retinal, and therefore, retinal functions independently of RA to prevent DIO. A second deduction proposed that low nM concentrations of RA stimulate adipogenesis, in contrast to higher concentrations. Using peer-reviewed LC/MS/MS assays developed and validated for quantifying tissue RA and retinal, we show that endogenous retinal and RA concentrations in adipose tissues from Raldh1-null mice do not correlate with the phenotype. Moreover, male Raldh1-null mice resist weight gain regardless of dietary fat content. Resistance to weight gain occurs during adolescence in both sexes. We show that RA concentrations as low as 1 nM, i.e. in the sub-physiological range, impair adipogenesis of embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type mice. Embryonic fibroblasts from Raldh1-null mice resist differentiating into adipocytes, but retain ability to generate RA. These fibroblasts remain sensitive to an RA receptor pan-agonist, and are not affected by an RA receptor pan-antagonist. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis that retinal itself represses weight gain and adipogenesis independently of RA. Instead, the data indicate that Raldh1 functions as a retinal and atRA-independent promoter of adiposity during adolescence, and enhances adiposity through pre-adipocyte cell autonomous actions."
https://openalex.org/W2766174790,"Angiogenic peptides have therapeutic potential for the treatment of chronic ischemic diseases. Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein expressed in injured tissues, promotes angiogenesis and tissue repair. We previously reported that in vivo administration of both recombinant full-length protein and the first FAS I domain of periostin alleviated peripheral artery occlusive disease by stimulating the migration of humane endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) and subsequent angiogenesis. In the present study, we ascertained the peptide sequence responsible for the periostin-induced angiogenesis. By serial deletion mapping of the first FAS I domain, we identified a peptide sequence (amino acids 142-151) of periostin for stimulation of chemotactic migration, adhesion, proliferation and endothelial tube formation of human ECFCs in vitro. Chemotactic migration of ECFCs induced by the periostin peptide was blocked by pre-incubation with an anti-β5 integrin neutralizing antibody. Treatment of ECFCs with the periostin peptide led to phosphorylation of both AKT and ERK, and pretreatment of ECFCs with the MEK-ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 or the PI3K-AKT pathway inhibitors, LY294002 or Wortmannin, blocked the periostin peptide-stimulated migration of ECFCs. These results suggest that the synthetic periostin peptide can be applied for stimulating angiogenic and therapeutic potentials of ECFCs."
https://openalex.org/W2766236308,"A glucose analog called 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) has been successfully used to sensitize cancer cells to ROS-inducing cancer treatments such as ionizing radiation, through the inhibition of glycolysis. However, the use of 2DG can be limited by several factors such as availability, non-specific cytotoxicity, and chemoresistance under hypoxic conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of non-radioactive 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (19FDG), a drug that potentially addresses current limitations of 2DG. The effectiveness of using either 2DG or 19FDG in combination with doxorubicin (Dox) in HeLa cells was determined in both normoxia and hypoxia. We have also shown that under both oxygen conditions, 19FDG-treated cells produce less lactate than 2DG-treated cells, an important finding that suggests improved inhibition of glycolysis, the preferential pathway for cancerous cells. When used in combination with Dox, we have demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of viable cells, with the effect of 19FDG remaining stable across both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the assessment of apoptosis and necrosis revealed that 19FDG maintained its ability to sensitize HeLa cells to Dox in hypoxia, but 2DG was only effective under normoxic conditions. The retained effectiveness of 19FDG in combination with Dox under hypoxic conditions, suggests that 19FDG may be efficacious for sensitizing hypoxic regions of solid tumour masses. Importantly, the ability of 19FDG to inhibit glucose uptake in vivo was also confirmed using positron emission tomography (PET) of xenograft tumours. The results displayed here suggest 19FDG is a promising combination therapy, which may lead to decreased ROS scavenging via glycolysis, and enhanced treatment success."
https://openalex.org/W2765550337,"Birds have genomic and chromosomal features that make them an attractive group to analyze the evolution of recombination rate and the distribution of crossing over. Yet, analyses are biased towards certain species, especially domestic poultry and passerines. Here we analyze for the first time the recombination rate and crossover distribution in the primitive ratite bird, Rhea americana (Rheiformes, Palaeognathae). Using a cytogenetic approach for in situ mapping of crossovers we found that the total genetic map is 3050 cM with a global recombination rate of 2.1 cM/Mb for female rheas. In the five largest macrobivalents there were 3 or more crossovers in most bivalents. Recombination rates for macrobivalents ranges between 1.8–2.1 cM/Mb and the physical length of their synaptonemal complexes is highly predictive of their genetic lengths. The crossover rate at the pseudoautosomal region is 2.1 cM/Mb, similar to those of autosomal pairs 5 and 6 and only slightly higher compared to other macroautosomes. It is suggested that the presence of multiple crossovers on the largest macrobivalents is a feature common to many avian groups, irrespective of their position throughout phylogeny. These data provide new insights to analyze the heterogeneous recombination landscape of birds."

https://openalex.org/W2765195226,"Background Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for impaired healing of peptic ulcers, and there are currently no supplementary therapeutics other than the standard antipeptic medicine to improve the ulcer healing in diabetes. This study examined the potential pleiotropic effect of a glucagon-like peptide (Glp)-1 analogue exendin (Ex)-4 on the regeneration of gastric ulcer in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Methods and results Chronic ulcer was created in rat stomach by submucosal injection of acetic acid and peri-ulcer tissues were analyzed 7 days after operation. Ulcer wound healing was impaired in diabetic rats with suppressed tissue expression of eNOS and enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory reactions. Treatment with intraperitoneal injection of Ex4 (0.5 μg/kg/d) significantly reduced the area of gastric ulcer without changing blood glucose level. Ex-4 restored the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, and attenuated the generation of regional inflammation and superoxide anions. The improvement of ulcer healing was associated with increased expression of MMP-2 and formation of granulation tissue in the peri-ulcer area. Conclusion Administration of Ex4 may induce pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative reactions in the peri-ulcer tissue of diabetic rats that eventually enhances tissue granulation and closure of ulcerative wounds. Our results support the potential clinical application of Glp-1 analogues as supplementary hypoglycemic agents in the antipeptic ulcer medication in diabetes."

They can bind to linker DNA entering and exiting the nucleosome and regulate transcriptional activity. Tetrahymena thermophila has two histone H1, namely, macronuclear histone H1 and micronuclear histone H1 (Mlh1). Mlh1 is specifically localized at micronuclei during growth and starvation stages. Moreover, Mlh1 is localized around micronuclei and forms a specific structure during the conjugation stage. It co-localizes partially with spindle apparatus during micronuclear meiosis. Analysis of MLH1 knock-out revealed that Mlh1 was required for the micronuclear integrity and development during conjugation stage. Overexpression of Mlh1 led to abnormal conjugation progression. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression level of HMGB3 increased in ΔMLH1 strains, while the expression level of MLH1 increased in ΔHMGB3 cells during conjugation. These results indicate that micronuclear integrity and sexual development require normal expression level of Mlh1 and that HmgB3 and Mlh1 may functionally compensate each other in regulating micronuclear structure in T. thermophila."

This extralabel manner could result in a drug-residue violation of the milk. The objective of this study was to determine the elimination kinetics of IMM CEF in lactating dairy cattle. The pharmacokinetic profile of CEF after repeated IMM administration in nine healthy cows and nine Staphylococcus aureus infected cows was investigated, alongside determining the MICs of Staph. aureus field strains. The MIC 90 value for CEF in Staph. aureus field strains (n = 31) was 0.25 μg/mL. The t >MIC CEF values for low- production quarters were longer than those for high- and mid- production quarters. The results showed that ceftiofur was detected in milk up to 108 h after the last infusion in both healthy and infected cows. Cows with low milk production eliminate IMM drugs more slowly than cows with higher production. Our findings suggest that this extralabel use is not encouraged and a prudent use is recommended for mastitis therapy. The use of CEF should be reserved for infections where susceptibility tests indicate its efficacy and when alternatives are not available."

Twenty-two eyes treated with intravitreal aflibercept for treatment-naïve neovascular AMD were studied retrospectively. The sub-RPE area, volume, and central retinal thickness (CRT) were evaluated 1 and 2 months after the loading phase using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Recurrence was defined as newly detected neovascular activity during the 6 months after the loading phase. In eyes with recurrent AMD, the sub-RPE area increased significantly (P = 0.036) from 1 to 2 months after the loading phase and the sub-RPE volume increased marginally (P = 0.06). Subgroup analysis showed significant (P = 0.008 and P = 0.016, respectively) increases in the sub-RPE area and volume in typical AMD. In eyes with no recurrence, no significant changes occurred in the two parameters. No significant CRT changes occurred in eyes with or without a recurrence. A quantitative analysis demonstrated an increased likelihood of the sub-RPE space shortly after the loading phase in eyes with recurrent AMD; no changes occurred in eyes without a recurrence. These early changes in the sub-RPE space could indicate disease activity and are valuable for predicting recurrences of neovascular AMD."

Whilst adenosine has been recognized to mediate the cardioprotective effect of C34T AMPD1, the precise pathophysiologic mechanism involved remains undefined to date. To address this issue, we used cardio-pulmonary exercise testing data (CPX) from subjects with myoadenylate deaminase (MAD) defects.From 2009 to 2013, all the patients referred in our laboratory to perform a metabolic exercise testing, i.e. a CPX with measurements of muscle metabolites in plasma during and after exercise testing, were prospectively enrolled. Subjects that also underwent an open muscle biopsy for diagnosis purpose were finally included. The metabolic-chronotropic response was assessed by calculating the slope of the linear relationship between the percent heart rate reserve and the percent metabolic reserve throughout exercise. MAD activity was measured using the Fishbein's technique in muscle biopsy sample. The common AMPD1 mutation was genotyped and the AMPD1 gene was sequenced to screen rare variants from blood DNA.Sixty-seven patients were included in the study; 5 had complete MAD deficiency, 11 had partial MAD deficiency, and 51 had normal MAD activity. Compared with normal MAD activity subjects, MAD deficient subjects appeared to have a lower-than-expected metabolic-chronotopic response during exercise. The metabolic-chronotropic relationship is more closely correlated with MAD activity in skeletal muscle (Rs = 0.57, p = 5.93E-7, Spearman correlation) than the presence of the common AMPD1 gene variant (Rs = 0.34, p = 0.005). Age-predicted O2 pulse ratio is significantly increased in MAD deficient subjects, indicating a greater efficiency of the cardiovascular system to deliver O2 (p < 0.01, Scheffé's post hoc test).The metabolic-chronotropic response is decreased in skeletal muscle MAD deficiency, suggesting a biological mechanism by which AMPD1 gene exerts cardiac effect."
https://openalex.org/W2766727778,"Introduction During rowing, foot positioning on the foot stretcher is critical to optimise muscle force transmission and boat propulsion. Following the beneficial effects of textured insoles on gait and balance, this study aims at investigating whether passive stimulation of foot mechanoreceptors induced by these insoles may contribute to improving foot loading pattern and symmetry during indoor rowing. Methods Eleven elite rowers were assessed during controlled training on a standard rowing machine while wearing control, low-density or high-density textured insoles. Plantar pressure and knee and trunk kinematics were measured; performance data were recorded from the machine. Insole effect on kinematic parameters, peak and average values of foot force, contact area and position of centre of pressure was assessed with ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for pair-wise comparisons. Results A main effect was observed for force and contact area, with the high-density insoles providing greatest values (P<0.035). No interaction was observed between side and insole (P>0.190), even though symmetry was higher with high-density insoles. Kinematics (P = 0.800) and rowing performance were not affected by insole type; a consistent though not statistically significant increase in mean travelled distance was observed for denser insoles (P>0.21). Conclusion The high-density textured insoles affected foot loading distribution during indoor rowing. Rowers applied greater foot force and over a greater foot stretcher area with the high-density than the low-density and control insoles. These findings and the methodology applied may be relevant for the understanding and monitoring of rowing performance."
https://openalex.org/W2766796701,"Estimating the size of key risk populations is essential for determining the resources needed to implement effective public health intervention programs. Several standard methods for population size estimation exist, but the statistical and practical assumptions required for their use may not be met when applied to HIV risk groups. We apply three approaches to estimate the number of people who inject drugs (PWID) in the Kohtla-Jarve region of Estonia using data from a respondent-driven (RDS) study: the standard multiplier estimate gives 654 people (95% CI 509-804), the successive sampling method gives estimates between 600 and 2500 people, and a network-based estimate that uses the RDS recruitment chain gives between 700 and 2800 people. We critically assess the strengths and weaknesses of these statistical approaches for estimating the size of hidden or hard-to-reach HIV risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2766983833,"Proteinuria is a powerful prognostic factor for end-stage renal disease in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients. However, it is not known whether proteinuria exacerbations are related to seasonal changes.We retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients diagnosed with IgAN by kidney biopsy at our hospital between 2002 and 2014. Proteinuria remission was defined as urinary protein <0.3 g/gCr in two consecutive outpatient urinalyses and exacerbation as urinary protein ≥0.75 g/gCr. Four seasons were defined: spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November), and winter (December-February). We performed a multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with the second remission following a proteinuria exacerbation.We analyzed 116 patients. Proteinuria remission and exacerbation occurred in 77, and 43 patients, respectively. The incidence of proteinuria exacerbation was significantly higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer (p = 0.040). The cumulative second remission rate was significantly higher in patients with autumn and winter proteinuria exacerbation than in patients with spring and summer exacerbations (p = 0.0091). In multivariate analyses, exacerbation onset in autumn and winter (hazard ratio [HR], 3.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-8.74) and intensive therapy (HR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.05-4.88) were significantly associated with a second proteinuria remission.In IgAN patients in proteinuria remission, proteinuria exacerbation frequently occurred in autumn and winter. Exacerbations occurring in autumn and winter tended to remit early."
https://openalex.org/W2766382825,"A spallation target is one of the three core parts of the accelerator driven subcritical system (ADS), which has already been investigated for decades. Recently, a gravity-driven Dense Granular-flow Target (DGT) is proposed, which consists of a cylindrical hopper and an internal coaxial cylindrical beam pipe. The research on the flow rate and free surface are important for the design of the target whether in Heavy Liquid Metal (HLM) targets or the DGT. In this paper, the relations of flow rate and the geometry of the DGT are investigated. Simulations based on the discrete element method (DEM) implementing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and experiments are both performed. It is found that the existence of an internal pipe doesn’t influence the flow rate when the distance from the bottom of the pipe to orifice is large enough even in a larger system. Meanwhile, snapshots of the free surface formed just below the beam pipe are given. It is observed that the free surface is stable over time. The entire research is meaningful for the design of DGT."
https://openalex.org/W2766399897,"Patients with heart failure (HF) display erectile dysfunction (ED). However, the pathophysiology of ED during HF remains poorly investigated.This study aimed to characterize the aortocaval fistula (ACF) rat model associated with HF as a novel experimental model of ED. We have undertaken molecular and functional studies to evaluate the alterations of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, autonomic nervous system and oxidative stress in the penis.Male rats were submitted to ACF for HF induction. Intracavernosal pressure in anesthetized rats was evaluated. Concentration-response curves to contractile (phenylephrine) and relaxant agents (sodium nitroprusside; SNP), as well as to electrical field stimulation (EFS), were obtained in the cavernosal smooth muscle (CSM) strips from sham and HF rats. Protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) and phosphodiestarese-5 in CSM were evaluated, as well as NOX2 (gp91phox) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) mRNA expression. SOD activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) were also performed in plasma.HF rats display erectile dysfunction represented by decreased ICP responses compared to sham rats. The neurogenic contractile responses elicited by EFS were greater in CSM from the HF group. Likewise, phenylephrine-induced contractions were greater in CSM from HF rats. Nitrergic response induced by EFS were decreased in the cavernosal tissue, along with lower eNOS, nNOS and phosphodiestarese-5 protein expressions. An increase of NOX2 and SOD mRNA expression in CSM and plasma TBARs of HF group were detected. Plasma SOD activity was decreased in HF rats.ED in HF rats is associated with decreased NO bioavailability in erectile tissue due to eNOS/nNOS dowregulation and NOX2 upregulation, as well as hypercontractility of the penis. This rat model of ACF could be a useful tool to evaluate the molecular alterations of ED associated with HF."
https://openalex.org/W2766462168,"Unpredictable forces which perturb balance are frequently applied to the body through interaction between the upper limb and the environment. Lower limb muscles respond rapidly to these postural disturbances in a highly specific manner. We have shown that the muscle activation patterns of lower limb muscles are organized in a direction specific manner which changes with lower limb stability. Ankle muscles change their activity within 80 ms of the onset of a force perturbation applied to the hand which is earlier than the onset of changes in ground reaction force, ankle angle or head motion. The latency of the response is sensitive to the perturbation direction. However, neither the latency nor the magnitude of the response is affected by stiffening the arm even though this alters the magnitude and timing of motion of the body segments. Based on the short latency, insensitivity of the change in ankle muscle activation to motion of the body segments but sensitivity to perturbation direction we reason that changes in ankle muscle activation are most likely triggered by sensory signals originating from cutaneous receptors in the hand. Furthermore, evidence that the latency of changes in ankle muscle activation depends on the number of perturbation directions suggests that the neural pathway is not confined to the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2766120336,"On the North American Great Plains, several snake species reach their northern range limit where they rely on sparsely distributed hibernacula located in major river valleys. Independent colonization histories for the river valleys and barriers to gene flow caused by the lack of suitable habitat between them may have produced genetically differentiated snake populations. To test this hypothesis, we used 10 microsatellite loci to examine the population structure of two species of conservation concern in Canada: the eastern yellow-bellied racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris) and bullsnake (Pituophis catenifer sayi) in 3 major river valleys in southern Saskatchewan. Fixation indices (FST) showed that populations in river valleys were significantly differentiated for both species (racers, FST = 0.096, P = 0.001; bullsnakes FST = 0.045-0.157, P = 0.001). Bayesian assignment (STRUCTURE) and ordination (DAPC) strongly supported genetically differentiated groups in the geographically distinct river valleys. Finer-scale subdivision of populations within river valleys was not apparent based on our data, but is a topic that should be investigated further. Our findings highlight the importance of major river valleys for snakes at the northern extent of their ranges, and raise the possibility that populations in each river valley may warrant separate management strategies."
