https://openalex.org/W2131112579,"Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have enabled whole genome re-sequencing in many species providing unprecedented discovery and characterization of molecular polymorphisms. There are limitations, however, to next-generation sequencing approaches for species with large complex genomes such as barley and wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) has been developed as a tool for association studies and genomics-assisted breeding in a range of species including those with complex genomes. GBS uses restriction enzymes for targeted complexity reduction followed by multiplex sequencing to produce high-quality polymorphism data at a relatively low per sample cost. Here we present a GBS approach for species that currently lack a reference genome sequence. We developed a novel two-enzyme GBS protocol and genotyped bi-parental barley and wheat populations to develop a genetically anchored reference map of identified SNPs and tags. We were able to map over 34,000 SNPs and 240,000 tags onto the Oregon Wolfe Barley reference map, and 20,000 SNPs and 367,000 tags on the Synthetic W9784×Opata85 (SynOpDH) wheat reference map. To further evaluate GBS in wheat, we also constructed a de novo genetic map using only SNP markers from the GBS data. The GBS approach presented here provides a powerful method of developing high-density markers in species without a sequenced genome while providing valuable tools for anchoring and ordering physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequence. Development of the sequenced reference genome(s) will in turn increase the utility of GBS data enabling physical mapping of genes and haplotype imputation of missing data. Finally, as a result of low per-sample costs, GBS will have broad application in genomics-assisted plant breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2081278295,"Neutrophils play an important role in innate immunity by defending the host organism against invading microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is mediated by release of antimicrobial peptides, phagocytosis as well as formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). These structures are composed of DNA, histones and granular proteins such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. This study focused on the influence of NET on the host cell functions, particularly on human alveolar epithelial cells as the major cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung. Upon direct interaction with epithelial and endothelial cells, NET induced cytotoxic effects in a dose-dependent manner, and digestion of DNA in NET did not change NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Pre-incubation of NET with antibodies against histones, with polysialic acid or with myeloperoxidase inhibitor but not with elastase inhibitor reduced NET-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that histones and myeloperoxidase are responsible for NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Although activated protein C (APC) did decrease the histone-induced cytotoxicity in a purified system, it did not change NET-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that histone-dependent cytotoxicity of NET is protected against APC degradation. Moreover, in LPS-induced acute lung injury mouse model, NET formation was documented in the lung tissue as well as in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These data reveal the important role of protein components in NET, particularly histones, which may lead to host cell cytotoxicity and may be involved in lung tissue destruction."
https://openalex.org/W1999414155,"Environmental factors during fetal development can induce a permanent epigenetic change in the germ line (sperm) that then transmits epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult-onset disease in the absence of any subsequent exposure. The epigenetic transgenerational actions of various environmental compounds and relevant mixtures were investigated with the use of a pesticide mixture (permethrin and insect repellant DEET), a plastic mixture (bisphenol A and phthalates), dioxin (TCDD) and a hydrocarbon mixture (jet fuel, JP8). After transient exposure of F0 gestating female rats during the period of embryonic gonadal sex determination, the subsequent F1–F3 generations were obtained in the absence of any environmental exposure. The effects on the F1, F2 and F3 generations pubertal onset and gonadal function were assessed. The plastics, dioxin and jet fuel were found to promote early-onset female puberty transgenerationally (F3 generation). Spermatogenic cell apoptosis was affected transgenerationally. Ovarian primordial follicle pool size was significantly decreased with all treatments transgenerationally. Differential DNA methylation of the F3 generation sperm promoter epigenome was examined. Differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) were identified in the sperm of all exposure lineage males and found to be consistent within a specific exposure lineage, but different between the exposures. Several genomic features of the DMR, such as low density CpG content, were identified. Exposure-specific epigenetic biomarkers were identified that may allow for the assessment of ancestral environmental exposures associated with adult onset disease."
https://openalex.org/W2030664470,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is one of the most frequent malignant pediatric brain tumor and its prognosis is universaly fatal. No significant improvement has been made in last thirty years over the standard treatment with radiotherapy. To address the paucity of understanding of DIPGs, we have carried out integrated molecular profiling of a large series of samples obtained with stereotactic biopsy at diagnosis. While chromosomal imbalances did not distinguish DIPG and supratentorial tumors on CGHarrays, gene expression profiling revealed clear differences between them, with brainstem gliomas resembling midline/thalamic tumours, indicating a closely-related origin. Two distinct subgroups of DIPG were identified. The first subgroup displayed mesenchymal and pro-angiogenic characteristics, with stem cell markers enrichment consistent with the possibility to grow tumor stem cells from these biopsies. The other subgroup displayed oligodendroglial features, and appeared largely driven by PDGFRA, in particular through amplification and/or novel missense mutations in the extracellular domain. Patients in this later group had a significantly worse outcome with an hazard ratio for early deaths, ie before 10 months, 8 fold greater that the ones in the other subgroup (p = 0.041, Cox regression model). The worse outcome of patients with the oligodendroglial type of tumors was confirmed on a series of 55 paraffin-embedded biopsy samples at diagnosis (median OS of 7.73 versus 12.37 months, p = 0.045, log-rank test). Two distinct transcriptional subclasses of DIPG with specific genomic alterations can be defined at diagnosis by oligodendroglial differentiation or mesenchymal transition, respectively. Classifying these tumors by signal transduction pathway activation and by mutation in pathway member genes may be particularily valuable for the development of targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1999019277,"Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality world-wide and the majority of cases are diagnosed at late stages of disease. There is currently no cost-effective screening test for NSCLC, and the development of such a test is a public health imperative. Recent studies have suggested that chest computed tomography screening of patients at high risk of lung cancer can increase survival from disease, however, the cost effectiveness of such screening has not been established. In this Phase I/II biomarker study we examined the feasibility of using serum miRNA as biomarkers of NSCLC using RT-qPCR to examine the expression of 180 miRNAs in sera from 30 treatment naive NSCLC patients and 20 healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and area under the curve were used to identify differentially expressed miRNA pairs that could distinguish NSCLC from healthy controls. Selected miRNA candidates were further validated in sera from an additional 55 NSCLC patients and 75 healthy controls. Examination of miRNA expression levels in serum from a multi-institutional cohort of 50 subjects (30 NSCLC patients and 20 healthy controls) identified differentially expressed miRNAs. A combination of two differentially expressed miRNAs miR-15b and miR-27b, was able to discriminate NSCLC from healthy controls with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% in the training set. Upon further testing on additional 130 subjects (55 NSCLC and 75 healthy controls), this miRNA pair predicted NSCLC with a specificity of 84% (95% CI 0.73–0.91), sensitivity of 100% (95% CI; 0.93–1.0), NPV of 100%, and PPV of 82%. These data provide evidence that serum miRNAs have the potential to be sensitive, cost-effective biomarkers for the early detection of NSCLC. Further testing in a Phase III biomarker study in is necessary for validation of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2022554656,"The aim of the current study was to survey if vowel articulation in speakers with Parkinson's disease (PD) shows specific changes in the course of the disease.67 patients with PD (42 male) and 40 healthy speakers (20 male) were tested and retested after an average time interval of 34 months. Participants had to read a given text as source for subsequent calculation of the triangular vowel space area (tVSA) and vowel articulation index (VAI). Measurement of tVSA and VAI were based upon analysis of the first and second formant of the vowels /α/, /i/and /u/ extracted from defined words within the text.At first visit, VAI values were reduced in male and female PD patients as compared to the control group, and showed a further decrease at the second visit. Only in female Parkinsonian speakers, VAI was correlated to overall speech impairment based upon perceptual impression. VAI and tVSA were correlated to gait impairment, but no correlations were seen between VAI and global motor impairment or overall disease duration. tVSA showed a similar reduction in the PD as compared to the control group and was also found to further decline between first and second examination in female, but not in male speakers with PD.Measurement of VAI seems to be superior to tVSA in the description of impaired vowel articulation and its further decline in the course of the disease in PD. Since impairment of vowel articulation was found to be independent from global motor function but correlated to gait dysfunction, measurement of vowel articulation might have a potential to serve as a marker of axial disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2131629629,"Recent studies suggest that sphingolipid metabolism is altered during type 2 diabetes. Increased levels of the sphingolipid ceramide are associated with insulin resistance. However, a role for sphingolipids in pancreatic beta cell function, or insulin production, and release remains to be established. Our studies in MIN6 cells and mouse pancreatic islets demonstrate that glucose stimulates an intracellular rise in the sphingolipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), whereas the levels of ceramide and sphingomyelin remain unchanged. The increase in S1P levels by glucose is due to activation of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). Interestingly, rises in S1P correlate with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Decreasing S1P levels by treatment of MIN6 cells or primary islets with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor reduces GSIS. Moreover, knockdown of SphK2 alone results in decreased GSIS, whereas knockdown of the S1P phosphatase, Sgpp1, leads to a rise in GSIS. Treatment of mice with the sphingosine kinase inhibitor impairs glucose disposal due to decreased plasma insulin levels. Altogether, our data suggest that glucose activates SphK2 in pancreatic beta cells leading to a rise in S1P levels, which is important for GSIS."
https://openalex.org/W1974926064,"Actin dynamics have been implicated in a variety of developmental processes during the malaria parasite lifecycle. Parasite motility, in particular, is thought to critically depend on an actomyosin motor located in the outer pellicle of the parasite cell. Efforts to understand the diverse roles actin plays have, however, been hampered by an inability to detect microfilaments under native conditions. To visualise the spatial dynamics of actin we generated a parasite-specific actin antibody that shows preferential recognition of filamentous actin and applied this tool to different lifecycle stages (merozoites, sporozoites and ookinetes) of the human and mouse malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei along with tachyzoites from the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Actin filament distribution was found associated with three core compartments: the nuclear periphery, pellicular membranes of motile or invasive parasite forms and in a ring-like distribution at the tight junction during merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in both human and mouse malaria parasites. Localisation at the nuclear periphery is consistent with an emerging role of actin in facilitating parasite gene regulation. During invasion, we show that the actin ring at the parasite-host cell tight junction is dependent on dynamic filament turnover. Super-resolution imaging places this ring posterior to, and not concentric with, the junction marker rhoptry neck protein 4. This implies motor force relies on the engagement of dynamic microfilaments at zones of traction, though not necessarily directly through receptor-ligand interactions at sites of adhesion during invasion. Combined, these observations extend current understanding of the diverse roles actin plays in malaria parasite development and apicomplexan cell motility, in particular refining understanding on the linkage of the internal parasite gliding motor with the extra-cellular milieu."
https://openalex.org/W1998806168,"Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly malignant and metastatic. Currently, there is no effective chemotherapy for patients with advanced HCC leading to an urgent need to seek for novel therapeutic options. We aimed to investigate the effect of a garlic derivative, S-allylcysteine (SAC), on the proliferation and metastasis of HCC. Methodology/Principal Findings A series of in vitro experiments including MTT, colony-forming, wound-healing, invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were performed to examine the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of SAC on a metastatic HCC cell line MHCC97L. The therapeutic values of SAC single and combined with cisplatin treatments were examined in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft liver tumor model. The result showed that the proliferation rate and colony-forming abilities of MHCC97L cells were suppressed by SAC together with significant suppression of the expressions of proliferation markers, Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Moreover, SAC hindered the migration and invasion of MHCC97L cells corresponding with up-regulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of VEGF. Furthermore, SAC significantly induced apoptosis and necrosis of MHCC97L cells through suppressing Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 as well as activating caspase-3 and caspase-9. In addition, SAC could significantly induce the S phase arrest of MHCC97L cells together with down-regulation of cdc25c, cdc2 and cyclin B1. In vivo xenograft liver tumor model demonstrated that SAC single or combined with cisplatin treatment inhibited the progression and metastasis of HCC tumor. Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of SAC on HCC cells and suggest that SAC may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2085172281,"Expression of the RCAN1 gene can be induced by multiple stresses. RCAN1 proteins (RCAN1s) have both protective and harmful effects and are implicated in common human pathologies. The mechanisms by which RCAN1s function, however, remain poorly understood. We identify RCAN1s as regulators of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) and demonstrate that induction of RCAN1-1L can cause dramatic degradation of mitochondria. The mechanisms of such degradation involve the adenine nucleotide translocator and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. We also demonstrate that RCAN1-1L induction can shift cellular bioenergetics from aerobic respiration to glycolysis, yet RCAN1-1L has very little effect on cell division, whereas it has a cumulative negative effect on cell survival. These results shed the light on mechanisms by which RCAN1s can protect or harm cells and by which they may operate in human pathologies. They also suggest that RCAN1s are important players in autophagy and such elusive phenomena as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

https://openalex.org/W2108198026,"The N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolases are a superfamily of enzymes specialized in the hydrolytic cleavage of amide bonds. Even though several members of this family are emerging as innovative drug targets for cancer, inflammation, and pain, the processes through which they catalyze amide hydrolysis remains poorly understood. In particular, the catalytic reactions of cysteine Ntn-hydrolases have never been investigated from a mechanistic point of view. In the present study, we used free energy simulations in the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics framework to determine the reaction mechanism of amide hydrolysis catalyzed by the prototypical cysteine Ntn-hydrolase, conjugated bile acid hydrolase (CBAH). The computational analyses, which were confirmed in water and using different CBAH mutants, revealed the existence of a chair-like transition state, which might be one of the specific features of the catalytic cycle of Ntn-hydrolases. Our results offer new insights on Ntn-mediated hydrolysis and suggest possible strategies for the creation of therapeutically useful inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2042762841,"TRPV1 is a member of the transient receptor potential ion channel family and is gated by capsaicin, the pungent component of chili pepper. It is expressed predominantly in small diameter peripheral nerve fibers and is activated by noxious temperatures >42 °C. 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) is a cytochrome P-450 4A/4F-derived metabolite of the membrane phospholipid arachidonic acid. It is a powerful vasoconstrictor and has structural similarities with other TRPV1 agonists, e.g. the hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid 12-HPETE, and we hypothesized that it may be an endogenous ligand for TRPV1 in sensory neurons innervating the vasculature. Here, we demonstrate that 20-HETE both activates and sensitizes mouse and human TRPV1, in a kinase-dependent manner, involving the residue Ser(502) in heterologously expressed hTRPV1, at physiologically relevant concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2012988962,"Calcium-independent phospholipase A(2)γ (iPLA(2)γ) (PNPLA8) is the predominant phospholipase activity in mammalian mitochondria. However, the chemical mechanisms that regulate its activity are unknown. Here, we utilize iPLA(2)γ gain of function and loss of function genetic models to demonstrate the robust activation of iPLA(2)γ in murine myocardial mitochondria by Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) ions. Calcium ion stimulated the production of 2-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (2-AA-LPC) from 1-palmitoyl-2-[(14)C]arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine during incubations with wild-type heart mitochondrial homogenates. Furthermore, incubation of mitochondrial homogenates from transgenic myocardium expressing iPLA(2)γ resulted in 13- and 25-fold increases in the initial rate of radiolabeled 2-AA-LPC and arachidonic acid (AA) production, respectively, in the presence of calcium ion. Mass spectrometric analysis of the products of calcium-activated hydrolysis of endogenous mitochondrial phospholipids in transgenic iPLA(2)γ mitochondria revealed the robust production of AA, 2-AA-LPC, and 2-docosahexaenoyl-LPC that was over 10-fold greater than wild-type mitochondria. The mechanism-based inhibitor (R)-(E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (BEL) (iPLA(2)γ selective), but not its enantiomer, (S)-BEL (iPLA(2)β selective) or pyrrolidine (cytosolic PLA(2)α selective), markedly attenuated Ca(2+)-dependent fatty acid release and polyunsaturated LPC production. Moreover, Ca(2+)-induced iPLA(2)γ activation was accompanied by the production of downstream eicosanoid metabolites that were nearly completely ablated by (R)-BEL or by genetic ablation of iPLA(2)γ. Intriguingly, Ca(2+)-induced iPLA(2)γ activation was completely inhibited by long-chain acyl-CoA (IC(50) ∼20 μm) as well as by a nonhydrolyzable acyl-CoA thioether analog. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mitochondrial iPLA(2)γ is activated by divalent cations and inhibited by acyl-CoA modulating the generation of biologically active metabolites that regulate mitochondrial bioenergetic and signaling functions."
https://openalex.org/W2029498660,"Background Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a serious global health burden. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (<3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. Conclusions The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses."

Ischemia was induced in anesthetized Wistar P7 rat pups by left middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation combined with a transient and concomitant occlusion of both common carotid arteries. Pups were sacrificed after 24 and 48 h. Sham-treated animals were sacrificed after 48 h. The frozen brains were sliced and subjected to desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry. There was a remarkable increase in the levels of many species of NAPEs in the whole injured area at both time points, and a clear but minor increase in selected NAEs. In the ischemic area, the sodium adducts of phosphatidylcholine and of lyso-phosphatidylcholine accumulated and the potassium adduct of phosphatidylcholine disappeared, indicating breakdown of the Na+/K+ pump. Free fatty acids, e.g., arachidonic and docosa-hexaenoic acids, tended to be more abundant in the periphery than in the center of the ischemic area and showed different spatial distribution. NAPEs are synthesized in the whole ischemic area where the cells seem to be dead and other phospholipids are degraded. Free fatty acids can be found in the periphery of the ischemic area.—Janfelt, C., Wellner, N., Leger, P.-L., Kokesch-Himmelreich, J., Hansen, S. H., Charriaut-Marlangue, C., Hansen, H. S.

https://openalex.org/W2001986040,"Differences in host susceptibility to different parasite types are largely based on the degree of matching between immune genes and parasite antigens. Specifically the variable genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a major role in the defence of parasites. However, underlying genetic mechanisms in wild populations are still not well understood because there is a lack of studies which deal with multiple parasite infections and their competition within. To gain insights into these complex associations, we implemented the full record of gastrointestinal nematodes from 439 genotyped individuals of the striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio. We used two different multivariate approaches to test for associations between MHC class II DRB genotype and multiple nematodes with regard to the main pathogen-driven selection hypotheses maintaining MHC diversity and parasite species-specific co-evolutionary effects. The former includes investigations of a 'heterozygote advantage', or its specific form a 'divergent-allele advantage' caused by highly dissimilar alleles as well as possible effects of specific MHC-alleles selected by a 'rare allele advantage' (= negative 'frequency-dependent selection'). A combination of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and co-inertia (COIA) analyses made it possible to consider multiple parasite species despite the risk of type I errors on the population and on the individual level. We could not find any evidence for a 'heterozygote' advantage but support for 'divergent-allele' advantage and infection intensity. In addition, both approaches demonstrated high concordance of positive as well as negative associations between specific MHC alleles and certain parasite species. Furthermore, certain MHC alleles were associated with more than one parasite species, suggesting a many-to-many gene-parasite co-evolution. The most frequent allele Rhpu-DRB*38 revealed a pleiotropic effect, involving three nematode species. Our study demonstrates the co-existence of specialist and generalist MHC alleles in terms of parasite detection which may be an important feature in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W1983239454,"The phenomenon of adaptive response (AR) in animal and human cells exposed to ionizing radiation is well documented in scientific literature. We have examined whether such AR could be induced in mice exposed to non-ionizing radiofrequency fields (RF) used for wireless communications. Mice were pre-exposed to 900 MHz RF at 120 µW/cm(2) power density for 4 hours/day for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days and then subjected to an acute dose of 3 Gy γ-radiation. The primary DNA damage in the form of alkali labile base damage and single strand breaks in the DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was determined using the alkaline comet assay. The results indicated that the extent of damage in mice which were pre-exposed to RF for 1 day and then subjected to γ-radiation was similar and not significantly different from those exposed to γ-radiation alone. However, mice which were pre-exposed to RF for 3, 5, 7 and 14 days showed progressively decreased damage and was significantly different from those exposed to γ-radiation alone. Thus, the data indicated that RF pre-exposure is capable of inducing AR and suggested that the pre-exposure for more than 4 hours for 1 day is necessary to elicit such AR."
https://openalex.org/W2010829090,"Forced convection can significantly influence the heat loss from birds and their offspring but effects may be reduced by using sheltered micro-sites such as cavities or constructing nests. The structural and thermal properties of the nests of two species, the spiny-cheeked honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis) and yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), were measured in relation to three wind speeds. Nest dimensions differ between the two species, despite the similar body mass of the incubating adults, however nest conductance is comparable. As wind speed increases, so does the rate of heat loss from the nests of both species, and further still during incubation recesses. The significance of forced convection through the nest is a near-doubling in heat production required by the parent, even when incubating at relatively low wind speeds. This provides confirmation that selecting a sheltered nest site is important for avian reproductive success."

Whereas BDNF promoted dendritic spine formation in embryonic cortical neurons, CSPGs abolished the effects of BDNF and eliminated existing dendritic spines when BDNF was present. The latter effect was dependent on the p75 receptor, presumably because BDNF binding to the p75 receptor elicits elimination of dendritic spines.

https://openalex.org/W2052521611,"Factor H (FH) is a soluble regulator of the human complement system affording protection to host tissues. It selectively inhibits amplification of C3b, the activation-specific fragment of the abundant complement component C3, in fluid phase and on self-surfaces and accelerates the decay of the alternative pathway C3 convertase, C3bBb. We have determined the crystal structure of the three carboxyl-terminal complement control protein (CCP) modules of FH (FH18–20) that bind to C3b, and which additionally recognize polyanionic markers specific to self-surfaces. These CCPs harbour nearly 30 disease-linked missense mutations. We have also deployed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate FH18–20 flexibility in solution using FH18–20 and FH19–20 constructs. In the crystal lattice FH18–20 adopts a “J”-shape: A ∼122-degree tilt between the structurally highly similar modules 18 and 19 precedes an extended, linear arrangement of modules 19 and 20 as observed in previously determined structures of these two modules alone. However, under solution conditions FH18–20 adopts multiple conformations mediated by flexibility between CCPs 18 and 19. We also pinpoint the locations of disease-associated missense mutations on the module 18 surface and discuss our data in the context of the C3b:FH interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2025531808,"Complications of atherosclerosis are the leading cause of death of patients with type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes. Understanding the mechanisms by which insulin resistance and hyperglycemia contribute to atherogenesis in key target tissues (liver, vessel wall, hematopoietic cells) can assist in the design of therapeutic approaches. We have shown that hyperglycemia induces FoxO1 deacetylation and that targeted knock-in of alleles encoding constitutively deacetylated FoxO1 in mice (Foxo1(KR/KR)) improves hepatic lipid metabolism and decreases macrophage inflammation, setting the stage for a potential anti-atherogenic effect of this mutation. Surprisingly, we report here that when Foxo1(KR/KR) mice are intercrossed with low density lipoprotein receptor knock-out mice (Ldlr(-/-)), they develop larger aortic root atherosclerotic lesions than Ldlr(-/-) controls despite lower plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The phenotype is unaffected by transplanting bone marrow from Ldlr(-/-) mice into Foxo1(KR/KR) mice, indicating that it is independent of hematopoietic cells and suggesting that the primary lesion in Foxo1(KR/KR) mice occurs in the vessel wall. Experiments in isolated endothelial cells from Foxo1(KR/KR) mice indicate that deacetylation favors FoxO1 nuclear accumulation and exerts target gene-specific effects, resulting in higher Icam1 and Tnfα expression and increased monocyte adhesion. The data indicate that FoxO1 deacetylation can promote vascular endothelial changes conducive to atherosclerotic plaque formation."

Whereas GABA(A) receptors containing α1, α2, or α3 subunits are mainly located synaptically where they interact with the submembranous scaffolding protein gephyrin, receptors containing α5 subunits are predominantly found extra-synaptically and seem to interact with radixin for anchorage. Neuroplastin is a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Our results reveal that neuroplastin and GABA(A) receptors can be co-purified from rat brain and exhibit a direct physical interaction as demonstrated by co-precipitation and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis in a heterologous expression system. The brain-specific isoform neuroplastin-65 co-localizes with GABA(A) receptors as shown in brain sections as well as in neuronal cultures, and such complexes can either contain gephyrin or be devoid of gephyrin. Neuroplastin-65 specifically co-localizes with α1 or α2 but not with α3 subunits at GABAergic synapses. In addition, neuroplastin-65 also co-localizes with GABA(A) receptor α5 subunits at extra-synaptic sites. Down-regulation of neuroplastin-65 by shRNA causes a loss of GABA(A) receptor α2 subunits at GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that neuroplastin-65 can co-localize with a subset of GABA(A) receptor subtypes and might contribute to anchoring and/or confining GABA(A) receptors to particular synaptic or extra-synaptic sites, thus affecting receptor mobility and synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2000267199,"G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) plays a key role in cardiac signaling regulation, and its expression is increased in heart failure. Recently, increased expression of GRK5 in the myocardium of mice has been shown to be detrimental in the setting of pressure-overload hypertrophy. The ubiquitous nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) is involved in the regulation of numerous genes in various tissues, and activation of NF-κB has been shown to be associated with heart disease. Here, we investigated the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation of the GRK5 gene and expression of this kinase in cardiomyocytes. First, in analyzing the 5′-flanking DNA of GRK5, the presence of a potential NF-κB binding site was observed in the promoter region. Phorbol myristate acetate, a known stimulator of NF-κB, increased the levels of GRK5 in myocytes whereas treatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine, a known inhibitor of NF-κB, or with SC 514, an inhibitor of IκB kinase 2 decreased GRK5. Utilizing EMSA or ChIP assays, we found that both p50 and p65 NF-κB could interact with the promoter of GRK5 following myocytes NF-κB activation. Importantly, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated loss of p65 in myocytes decreased the stimulated increased levels of GRK5 mRNA and protein. Finally, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα in myocytes inhibited the levels of GRK5. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NF-κB plays a critical role in the regulation of GRK5 transcription in myocytes and that this may translate to the significant expression changes seen in heart disease.

GPCRs undergo nodal regulation following agonist activation triggered by phosphorylation via family of kinases such as GPCR kinases (GRKs) (1Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

GRK phosphorylation of activated receptors triggers a process of desensitization that involves the loss of the G protein signal through β-arrestin binding to the phosphorylated receptor (1Rockman H.A. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Seven transmembrane-spanning receptors and heart function.Nature. 2002; 415: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Seven GRKs have been identified, and they all have distinct tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and undergo specific regulatory actions (2Brinks H. Koch W.J.

Physiological roles of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and arrestins.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 511-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). For example, GRK2 and 3 are cytosolic kinases that actively translocate to the plasma membrane to target GPCRs and do so by binding to the βγ subunits of dissociated heterotrimeric G proteins, whereas GRK4–6 are primarily associated with the membrane at all times (3Premont R.T.

G protein-coupled receptor kinases in normal and failing myocardium.Front Biosci. 2011; 17: 3047-3060Google Scholar), including our recent report where nuclear GRK5 activity in myocytes was found to promote maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy in mice after pressure overload (5Martini J.S.

Because enhanced expression of GRKs appears to be a critical component to detrimental cardiac signaling and function, it is important to uncover specific regulators of GRK gene expression in myocytes to potentially block untoward increases in levels and activity. This is an area of GRK biology that has not been well studied and is of particular importance to GRK5 because it can act in a GRK-independent manner in the nucleus of myocytes (5Martini J.S. Raake P. Vinge L.E. DeGeorge Jr., B.R. DeGeorge Jr., B. Chuprun J.K. Harris D.M. Gao E. Eckhart A.D. Pitcher J.A. Koch W.J.

This occurs because of a novel nuclear activity of GRK5 acting as a class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) kinase, and its up-regulation causes enhanced nuclear activity of GRK5 phosphorylating HDAC5 and its disinhibition of hypertrophic and maladaptive gene transcription (5Martini J.S.

Nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that has been shown to regulate gene expression in a variety of cell types in the cardiovascular system, including cardiomyocytes (9Gordon J.W. Shaw J.A. Kirshenbaum L.A. Multiple facets of NF-κB in the heart. To be or not to NF-κB.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The NF-κB-dependent transcriptional network is thought to have great significance to cardiovascular disease (10Jones W.K. Brown M. Wilhide M. He S. Ren X. NF-κB in cardiovascular disease. Diverse and specific effects of a “general” transcription factor?.Cardiovasc. Toxicol. 2005; 5: 183-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) although its activation has been shown to be both beneficial and detrimental to cardiac function. The dynamic roles of NF-κB in different cardiovascular pathologies may be due to its ability to regulate a wide range of genes. NF-κB may play a key role in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and HF (11Valen G. Yan Z.Q. Hansson G.K. Nuclear factor κ-B and the heart.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 38: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In HF, NF-κB may play a detrimental role by up-regulating the expression of TNF-α and other proinflammatory molecules but may also have beneficial roles for the resolution of inflammation and in tissue remodeling because it regulates several antiapoptotic genes (9Gordon J.W. Shaw J.A. Kirshenbaum L.A. Multiple facets of NF-κB in the heart. To be or not to NF-κB.Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 12Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Possible new role for NF-κB in the resolution of inflammation.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by multiple stimuli, including those present in ischemic and hypertrophic myocardium (9Gordon J.W. Shaw J.A. Kirshenbaum L.A. Multiple facets of NF-κB in the heart.

TNF-α is a potent stimulator of NF-κB activity, and it can also be activated in cardiomyocytes by specific GPCR agonists, especially those that induce hypertrophy (9Gordon J.W. Shaw J.A.

Interestingly, GRK5 has been shown to interact with and influence NF-κB signaling (14Patial S. Luo J. Porter K.J. Benovic J.L. Parameswaran N.

In light of this and the role NF-κB has as a potential critical mediator of cardiac hypertrophy, we investigated whether this transcription factor could specifically regulate GRK5 gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Our data presented below unveils novel aspects of the GRK5 promoter region and specific regulation of this gene by activation of NF-κB signaling in cardiac myocytes promoting stress-induced GRK5 up-regulation. Ventricular cardiomyocytes from 1- to 2-day-old rat neonatal hearts (NRVMs) were prepared, as we have published recently (18Brinks H. Boucher M. Gao E. Chuprun J.K. Pesant S. Raake P.W. Huang Z.M. Wang X. Qiu G. Gumpert A. Harris D.M. Eckhart A.D. Most P. Koch W.J.

Res. 2010; 107: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Myocytes were cultured in Ham's F-10 supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) and 5% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere for 2–3 days. NRVMs were cultured for 24 h in complete medium consisting of 85% Ham's F-10, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 5% FBS at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and 95% ambient air followed by maintenance in 5% FBS containing medium for another 24 h. After 2 days, cells were maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of PMA or NAC or SC 514 or in combination for 24 h. In some experiments, myocytes were treated with p65 siRNA (in the presence or absence of PMA) or adenoviruses expressing the dominant negative form of IκBα or GFP. The cells were scraped from the dishes using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml) (Roche) and lysed using lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Proteins (10 μg) were separated on NuPAGE Novex 4–20% bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies to GRK5, p65, phosphorylated p65 (P-p65), p50, IκBα, β-actin, and GAPDH. Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Nuclear extracts (NE) were prepared from NRVMs as described previously (19Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. A small-scale procedure for preparation of nuclear extracts that support efficient transcription and pre-mRNA splicing.Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the NF-κB (NF-κB is underlined) and flanking sequences (sense, 5′-GAG CGT GGG GAT CCC GGG AGT C-3′ and antisense, 5′-GAC TCC CGG GAT CCC CAC GCT C-3′) in the GRK5 gene were used in the EMSA. The oligos were end-labeled using IRdye 700 and used as probes (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Nuclear proteins (7 μg) were incubated with IRdye-labeled NF-κB oligonucleotide in the dark for 30 min at room temperature in reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 75 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Li-Cor) as a nonspecific competitor. For the antibody-mediated super shift assay, 1 μg of p50 or p65 was incubated in reaction mixture for 30 min followed by incubation with an IRdye-labeled probe for another 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from the free probe on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The image was visualized and scanned by an Odyssey infrared imaging system. NRVMs were cultured for 24 h in complete medium and then changed to 5% FBS containing medium for another 24 h. Cells in 5% medium were then maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of PMA for 24 h. ChIP was performed as described in detail previously (20Islam K.N. Mendelson C.R. Permissive effects of oxygen on cyclic AMP and interleukin-1 stimulation of surfactant protein A gene expression are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2901-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The soluble chromatin (500 μl) was incubated with antibodies for p50 and p65 (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight. Two aliquots were reserved as “controls:” one incubated without antibody and the other with non-immune IgG. Immune complexes were isolated using protein A/G Plus-agarose beads and collected by centrifugation. Cross-linking of the immunoprecipitated chromatin complexes and “input controls” (5% of the total soluble chromatin) were reversed by heating the samples at 65 °C for 4 h, followed by incubation with proteinase K, DNA purification by phenolchloroform extraction, and precipitation in EtOH at −20 °C. Samples and input controls were diluted in TE buffer just prior to PCR. Real-time QPCR was carried out using the following primers to amplify 112 bp of the rGRK5 5′-flanking region surrounding the NF-κB (forward, 5′-TTTGGTTATAATGAAAATCGTAGGG-3′; reverse, 5′ GTCTACGCGAACCAGAATGC-3′). NRVMs were cultured for 24 h in complete medium and then changed to 5% FBS containing medium for another 24 h. Cells in 5% medium were then maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of PMA or p65 siRNA or in combination for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from these cells by the one-step method described previously (21Islam K.N. Mendelson C.R. Glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor inhibition of surfactant protein-A (SP-A) gene expression in lung type II cells is mediated by repressive changes in histone modification at the SP-A promoter.Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (TRIzol, Invitrogen). RNA was treated with DNase to remove any contaminating DNA, and 1 μg was reverse-transcribed using the isoscript cDNA synthesis kit from Bio-Rad. Validated primer sets directed against GRK5 (forward, 5′-CAA GGA GCT GAA TGT GTT CGG AC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCT GCT TCC AGT GGA GTT TGA AT-3′) and p65 (forward, 5′-CAA GTG CCT TAA TAG CAG GGC AAA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGA GCT AGA AAG AGC AAG AGT CCA AT-3′) along with the constitutively expressed 18S rRNA (forward, 5′-ACC GCA GCT AGG AAT AAT GGA-3′; reverse, 5′-GCC TCA GTT CCG AAA ACC A-3′) were used for quantitative PCR amplification. The Bio-Rad detection system (MyIQ) was employed using the DNA binding dye SYBR Green for the quantitative detection of PCR products. The cycle threshold was set at a level where the exponential increase in PCR amplification was approximately parallel between all samples. Data were normalized by analyzing the ratio of the target cDNA concentrations to that of 18 S rRNA. We have compared expression of 18S rRNA to that of GAPDH and have found both to be unaffected by PMA or p65 siRNA treatment. NRVMs were cultured for 24 h in complete medium and then changed to 5% FBS containing medium for another 24 h. Cells in 5% medium were then maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of p65 siRNA (30 nm) for 24 h using Hiperfect as transfecting reagent from Qiagen. The media were changed and followed by incubation for another 24 h. Cells were treated with or without 20 nm PMA for 24 h. After harvesting the cells total lysates and RNA were prepared. Lysates were used to determine proteins levels by immunoblot analysis. cDNAs obtained from RNA were analyzed by real-time QPCR using the primers for GRK5, p65, and 18S. NRVMs were cultured for 24 h in complete medium and then changed to 5% FBS-containing medium for another 24 h. Cells in 5% medium were then maintained in serum-free medium and were infected with recombinant adenoviruses as described previously (22Peppel K. Zhang L. Orman E.S. Hagen P.O. Amalfitano A. Brian L. Freedman N.J. Activation of vascular smooth muscle cells by TNF and PDGF: overlapping and complementary signal transduction mechanisms.Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated overnight with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either dominant-negative IκBα (Ad-dm-IκBα) (multiplicity of infection = 100, 200) or with GFP (Ad-GFP) (multiplicity of infection = 100, 200). The next day, media were removed and changed to serum-free media and incubated another 48 h. Cells were harvested and lysed followed by immunoblot analysis. All values in the text and figures are presented as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments from given n sizes. Statistical significance between two groups was determined using the two-tailed Student's t test. p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. In characterizing the 5′-flanking region of the GRK5 gene we found a consensus sequence for a putative binding site for NF-κB. This region is conserved between the rat, mouse, and human GRK5 genes and lies ∼800 bp from the start of transcription (Fig. 1A). To examine whether this putative site is active, we tested whether the p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB could bind to the GRK5 gene promoter. We first analyzed binding of nuclear proteins from neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) to an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide using EMSA. As shown, nuclear extracts from myocytes had positive binding to the NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, lane 2). To determine whether the binding of NF-κB is specific, we then utilized competitive EMSA and antibody-mediated super shift EMSA in myocyte nuclear extracts. In this experiment, the non-labeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide competed with labeled NF-κB oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Moreover, antibodies to NF-κB proteins, p50 and p65, added alone reduced or abolished the intensity of the band of NF-κB-nuclear protein complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate the presence of p50 and p65 in the GRK5 promoter complex. PMA is a specific activator of PKC (23Vijayan K. Szotek E.L. Martin J.L. Samarel A.M. Protein kinase C-alpha-induced hypertrophy of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes.Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: H2777-H2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which can activate NF-κB through PKC as well as through the induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (24Lee H.B. Yu M.R. Song J.S. Ha H. Reactive oxygen species amplify protein kinase C signaling in high glucose-induced fibronectin expression by human peritoneal mesothelial cells.Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 1170-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PMA is a well established hypertrophic agent in myocytes and, accordingly, was tested to determine whether it could induce GRK5 expression in NRVMs. Using RT-PCR methods we determined the effects of PMA on mRNA expression of GRK5 in myocytes. As shown in Fig. 2A, 20 nm of PMA induced the expression of GRK5 within 30 min, and this induction remained for over 6 h. Of note, p65 increased in a parallel fashion after myocytes were treated with this hypertrophic agent (Fig. 2B). In light of stimulatory effects on GRK5 mRNA expression as well as p65, we determined the effects of PMA on NF-κB and GRK5 protein as well as the DNA binding activity of NF-κB to the GRK5 promoter. Protein levels for NF-κB and GRK5 were analyzed by immunoblotting, and binding activity of NF-κB was analyzed by EMSA using nuclear proteins from myocytes treated with PMA or control media for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, protein levels of GRK5, p50, and p65 were markedly increased by the treatment of myocytes with PMA. In the EMSA analysis, PMA-treated myocytes showed increased NF-κB binding activity to GRK5 promoter as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2E). Because PMA increases the expression of both GRK5 and NF-κB in myocytes, presumably due at least in part to increased binding of NF-κB to the GRK5 promoter we carried out ChIP to analyze the effects of PMA on in vivo binding of p50 and p65 to the GRK5 promoter. NRVMs were cultured in the presence or absence of PMA for 24 h and nuclear DNA was purified from lysate samples immunoprecipitated using with anti-p50 or anti-p65 sera. Subsequently, quantitative PCR was used to amplify a 112 bp genomic region surrounding the NF-κB site within the 5′-flanking region of GRK5 promoter (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B and C, PMA stimulated the in vivo recruitment of p50 and p65 to the GRK5 promoter. NAC is known inhibitor of NF-κB and it can also act as an antioxidant by scavenging ROS. To determine the effect of NAC for both proteins levels and DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in myocytes, an EMSA was carried out. We found that NAC decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 4A). Further, NAC also decreased GRK5 and p65 protein levels when myocytes were treated with PMA and also basally (Fig. 4, B and C). Lowering the levels of both proteins as well as DNA binding activity by NAC indicates the involvement of ROS and NF-κB for induction of GRK5 expression. In addition to NAC effect on GRK5 expression, SC 514, a selective inhibitor of IκB kinase 2 (IKK2) (also known as inhibitor of NF-κB mediated gene expression or inhibitor of NF-κB activation) has been tested on PMA-induced GRK5 expression in myocytes. To determine the effect of SC 514, cells were treated with PMA or SC 514 or in combination. EMSA was carried out to determine NF-κB DNA binding activity, and immunoblot analysis was used to analyze GRK5 protein levels. As can be seen in Fig. 4D, SC 514 markedly decreased the NF-κB DNA binding activity in control cell as well as cells treated with PMA. Interestingly, the levels of GRK5 were also significantly decreased by SC 514 in the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 4, E and F), suggesting that activation of NF-κB plays an important role in GRK5 expression. The data presented thus far suggest that NF-κB proteins act to mediate induction of GRK5 expression in myocytes. To directly demonstrate the mechanistic action of NF-κB, we treated NRVMs with siRNA against rat p65. After transfection cells were treated with or without PMA. As can be seen, cells treated with p65 siRNA showed significant reduction of p65 levels compared with levels found in cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the loss of p65 translated to a lowering of GRK5 protein in myocytes (Fig. 5A) that was also seen at the mRNA level (B). PMA treatment was not able to induce either mRNA or proteins levels of GRK5 in p65 siRNA transfected cells (Fig. 5, A and B). The immunoblot analysis in Fig. 5A showed profound phosphorylation of p65 by PMA treatment. Silencing of p65 prevented p65 phosphorylation evoked by PMA. Thus, it appears that levels of p65 directly determine GRK5 expression levels in myocytes both under basal and stimulated conditions. To further confirm the involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of GRK5 in myocytes, cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing a dominant-negative form of IκBα (Ad-dm-IκBα) or GFP (Ad-GFP) as a control. The dominant-negative isoform of IκB contains mutations in the IκB kinase phosphorylation sites (Ser-34, Ser-36) and is resistant to degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (22Peppel K. Zhang L. Orman E.S. Hagen P.O. Amalfitano A. Brian L. Freedman N.J. Activation of vascular smooth muscle cells by TNF and PDGF: overlapping and complementary signal transduction mechanisms.Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 65: 674-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This enables the overexpressed proteins to sequester p65/p50 complexes within the cell, thereby blocking activation of NF-κB. Overexpression of dm-IκBα was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5C, center panel). As also shown in Fig. 5C (top panel), this dominant-negative IκB inhibited GRK5 expression, as levels are significantly lower than in myocytes expressing GFP (D). These findings again suggest a role of endogenous NF-κB proteins in the regulation of GRK5 gene expression in myocytes. GRKs are recognized as critical regulators of GPCR signaling on the b"

Mucosal cationic polypeptides can potentially be regulated for this purpose and we here aimed to determine their endogenous expression and HIV neutralizing activity in genital secretions of women at risk of HIV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) of Kenyan women in HIV-serodiscordant relationships (HESN, n = 164; HIV seropositive, n = 60) and low-risk controls (n = 72) were assessed for the cationic polypeptides HNP1–3, LL-37 and SLPI by ELISA and for HIV neutralizing activity by a PBMC-based assay using an HIV primary isolate. Median levels of HNP1–3 and LL-37 in CVS were similar across study groups. Neither HSV-2 serostatus, nor presence of bacterial vaginosis, correlated with levels of HNP1–3 or LL-37 in the HESN women. However, an association with their partner's viral load was observed. High viral load (>10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml plasma) correlated with higher levels of HNP1–3 and LL-37 (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). SLPI was most abundant in the low-risk group and did not correlate with male partner's viral load in the HESN women. HIV neutralizing activity was found in CVS of all study groups. In experimental studies, selective depletion of cationic polypeptides from CVS rendered the remaining CVS fraction non-neutralizing, whereas the cationic polypeptide fraction retained the activity. Furthermore, recombinant HNP1–3 and LL-37 could induce neutralizing activity when added to CVS lacking intrinsic activity. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that CVS from HESN, low-risk, and HIV seropositive women contain HIV neutralizing activity. Although several innate immune proteins, including HNP1–3 and LL-37, contribute to this activity these molecules can also have inflammatory properties. This balance is influenced by hormonal and environmental factors and in the present HIV serodiscordant couple cohort study we show that a partner's viral load is associated with levels of such molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2132377119,"Fruits of Broussonetia papyrifera from South China were analyzed for their total chemical composition, and antioxidant activities in ethanol and aqueous extracts. In the fruit of this plant, the crude protein, crude fat and carbohydrates was 7.08%, 3.72% and 64.73% of dry weight, respectively. The crude protein, crude fat and carbohydrates were 15.71%, 20.51% and 36.09% of dry weight, respectively. Fatty acid and amino acid composition of the fruit were analyzed. Unsaturated fatty acid concentration was 70.6% of the total fatty acids. The percentage of the essential amino acids (EAAs) was 40.60% of the total amino acids. Furthermore, B. papyrifera fruit are rich in many mineral elements and vitamins. Total phenolic content was assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteau assay, whereas antioxidant activities were assessed by measuring the ability of the two extracts to scavenge DPPH radicals, inhibit peroxidation, and chelate ferric ions. Their reducing power was also assessed. Results indicated that the aqueous extract of B. papyrifera was a more potent reducing agent and radical-scavenger than the ethanol extract. GC–MS analysis of the ethanol extract showed the presence of some acid-containing compounds. The changes in total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity in B. papyrifera from four different regions grown under normal conditions were assessed. The antioxidant activity of different extracts was positively associated with their total phenolic content. These results suggest that the fruit of B. papyrifera could be used in dietary supplement preparations, or as a food additive, for nutritional gain, or to prevent oxidation in food products."
https://openalex.org/W2137870030,"Background Death receptors (DR) of the TNF family function as anti-tumor immune effector molecules. Tumor cells, however, often exhibit DR-signaling resistance. Previous studies indicate that radiation can modify gene expression within tumor cells and increase tumor cell sensitivity to immune attack. The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation in sensitizing colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings The ability of radiation to modulate the expression of multiple death receptors (Fas/CD95, TRAILR1/DR4, TRAILR2/DR5, TNF-R1 and LTβR) was examined in colorectal tumor cells. The functional significance of sub-lethal doses of radiation in enhancing tumor cell susceptibility to DR-induced apoptosis was determined by in vitro functional sensitivity assays. The longevity of these changes and the underlying molecular mechanism of irradiation in sensitizing diverse colorectal carcinoma cells to death receptor-mediated apoptosis were also examined. We found that radiation increased surface expression of Fas, DR4 and DR5 but not LTβR or TNF-R1 in these cells. Increased expression of DRs was observed 2 days post-irradiation and remained elevated 7-days post irradiation. Sub-lethal tumor cell irradiation alone exhibited minimal cell death, but effectively sensitized three of three colorectal carcinoma cells to both TRAIL and Fas-induced apoptosis, but not LTβR-induced death. Furthermore, radiation-enhanced Fas and TRAIL-induced cell death lasted as long as 5-days post-irradiation. Specific analysis of intracellular sensitizers to apoptosis indicated that while radiation did reduce Bcl-XL and c-FLIP protein expression, this reduction did not correlate with the radiation-enhanced sensitivity to Fas and/or TRAIL mediated apoptosis among the three cell types. Conclusions/Significance Irradiation of tumor cells can overcome Fas and TRAIL resistance that is long lasting. Overall, results of these investigations suggest that non-lethal doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to attack by anti-tumor effector molecules and cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974734598,"DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) occur constantly in eukaryotes. These potentially lethal DNA lesions are repaired efficiently by two major DSB repair pathways: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We investigated NHEJ in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) by introducing DNA double-strand breaks through inducible expression of I-SceI, followed by amplification of individual repair junction sequences by single-molecule PCR. Using this process over 300 NHEJ repair junctions were analysed in each species. In contrast to previously published variation in DSB repair between Arabidopsis and tobacco, the two species displayed similar DSB repair profiles in our experiments. The majority of repair events resulted in no loss of sequence and small (1-20 bp) deletions occurred at a minority (25-45%) of repair junctions. Approximately ~1.5% of the observed repair events contained larger deletions (>20 bp) and a similar percentage contained insertions. Strikingly, insertion events in tobacco were associated with large genomic deletions at the site of the DSB that resulted in increased micro-homology at the sequence junctions suggesting the involvement of a non-classical NHEJ repair pathway. The generation of DSBs through inducible expression of I-SceI, in combination with single molecule PCR, provides an effective and efficient method for analysis of individual repair junctions and will prove a useful tool in the analysis of NHEJ."
https://openalex.org/W2023052604,"Junctophilins (JPs) play an important role in the formation of junctional membrane complexes (JMC) in striated muscle by physically linking the transverse-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. Researchers have found five JP2 mutants in humans with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Among these, Y141H and S165F are associated with severely altered Ca(2+) signaling in cardiomyocytes. We previously reported that S165F also induced both hypertrophy and altered intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in mouse skeletal myotubes. In the present study, we attempted to identify the dominant-negative role(s) of Y141H in primary mouse skeletal myotubes. Consistent with S165F, Y141H led to hypertrophy and altered Ca(2+) signaling (a decrease in the gain of excitation-contraction coupling and an increase in the resting level of myoplasmic Ca(2+)). However, unlike S165F, neither ryanodine receptor 1-mediated Ca(2+) release from the SR nor the phosphorylation of the mutated JP2 by protein kinase C was related to the altered Ca(2+) signaling by Y141H. Instead, abnormal JMC and increased SOCE via Orai1 were found, suggesting that the hypertrophy caused by Y141H progressed differently from S165F. Therefore JP2 can be linked to skeletal muscle hypertrophy via various Ca(2+) signaling pathways, and SOCE could be one of the causes of altered Ca(2+) signaling observed in muscle hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2075405828,"Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a zinc finger-containing transcriptional factor, is a pivotal regulator of cellular fate. KLF4 has attracted considerable attention for its opposing effect in carcinogenesis as tumor suppressor (e.g. colorectal cancer) or oncoprotein (e.g. breast cancer), depending on tissue context, with the underlying mechanism remaining largely unknown. Here we report that KLF4 mediates estrogen signaling in breast cancer formation. Accumulation of KLF4 by inhibiting its turnover triggers estrogen-induced transactivation. We identified Von Hippel-Lindau, pVHL, as the protein that governs KLF4 turnover in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that estrogen-induced down-regulation of pVHL facilitates accumulation of KLF4. We provide mechanistic insights into KLF4 steady-state degradation as well as its elevation in the presence of estrogen and show that elevated levels of pVHL or depletion of KLF4 attenuates the estrogen-induced transactivation and cell growth. Finally, immunohistochemical staining revealed reduced concentration of pVHL and accumulation of KLF4 in breast cancer tissues. We thus propose that suppression of pVHL in response to estrogen signaling results in elevation of KLF4, which mediates estrogen-induced mitogenic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2075261760,"Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are the most common reasons for invasive prenatal testing. Currently, G-band karyotyping and several molecular genetic methods have been established for diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities. Although these testing methods are highly reliable, the major limitation remains restricted resolutions or can only achieve limited coverage on the human genome at one time. The massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies which can reach single base pair resolution allows detection of genome-wide intragenic deletions and duplication challenging karyotyping and microarrays as the tool for prenatal diagnosis. Here we reported a novel and robust MPS-based method to detect aneuploidy and imbalanced chromosomal arrangements in amniotic fluid (AF) samples. We sequenced 62 AF samples on Illumina GAIIx platform and with averagely 0.01× whole genome sequencing data we detected 13 samples with numerical chromosomal abnormalities by z-test. With up to 2× whole genome sequencing data we were able to detect microdeletion/microduplication (ranged from 1.4 Mb to 37.3 Mb of 5 samples from chorionic villus sampling (CVS) using SeqSeq algorithm. Our work demonstrated MPS is a robust and accurate approach to detect aneuploidy and imbalanced chromosomal arrangements in prenatal samples."
https://openalex.org/W2150185007,"The cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene CAS/CSE1L is overexpressed in cancer, although it was originally identified as a gene that renders cells vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli. CAS/CSE1L has roles in the nucleocytoplasmic recycling of importin-α and in the regulation of gene expression, cell migration, and secretion. We identified CAS/CSE1L as a survival factor for ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In 3/3 ovarian cancer cell lines, CAS/CSE1L was down-modulated by the unorthodox proapoptotic signaling of the MET receptor. CAS/CSE1L knockdown with RNA interference committed the ovarian cancer cells to death, but not immortalized normal cells and breast and colon cancer cells. In 70 and 95% of these latter cells, respectively, CAS/CSE1L was localized in the cytoplasm, while it accumulated in the nucleus in >90% of ovarian cancer cells. Nuclear localization depended on AKT, which was constitutively active in ovarian cancer cells. In the nucleus, CAS/CSE1L regulated the expression of the proapoptotic Ras-association domain family 1 gene products RASSF1C and RASSF1A, which mediated death signals evoked by depletion of CAS/CSE1L. Our data show that CAS/CSE1L protects ovarian cancer cells from death through transcriptional suppression of a proapoptotic gene and suggest that the localization of CAS/CSE1L dictates its function.—Lorenzato, A., Martino, C., Dani, N., Oligschläger, Y., Ferrero, A.

https://openalex.org/W2040065502,"Although previous studies showed that glucose is used to support the metabolic activity of the cartilaginous fish brain, the distribution and expression levels of glucose transporter (GLUT) isoforms remained undetermined. Optic/ultrastructural immunohistochemistry approaches were used to determine the expression of GLUT1 in the glial blood-brain barrier (gBBB). GLUT1 was observed solely in glial cells; it was primarily located in end-feet processes of the gBBB. Western blot analysis showed a protein with a molecular mass of 50 kDa, and partial sequencing confirmed GLUT1 identity. Similar approaches were used to demonstrate increased GLUT1 polarization to both apical and basolateral membranes in choroid plexus epithelial cells. To explore monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) involvement in shark brain metabolism, the expression of MCTs was analyzed. MCT1, 2 and 4 were expressed in endothelial cells; however, only MCT1 and MCT4 were present in glial cells. In neurons, MCT2 was localized at the cell membrane whereas MCT1 was detected within mitochondria. Previous studies demonstrated that hypoxia modified GLUT and MCT expression in mammalian brain cells, which was mediated by the transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1. Similarly, we observed that hypoxia modified MCT1 cellular distribution and MCT4 expression in shark telencephalic area and brain stem, confirming the role of these transporters in hypoxia adaptation. Finally, using three-dimensional ultrastructural microscopy, the interaction between glial end-feet and leaky blood vessels of shark brain was assessed in the present study. These data suggested that the brains of shark may take up glucose from blood using a different mechanism than that used by mammalian brains, which may induce astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttling and metabolic coupling as observed in mammalian brain. Our data suggested that the structural conditions and expression patterns of GLUT1, MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 in shark brain may establish the molecular foundation of metabolic coupling between glia and neurons."

Racial and regional factors are important in clinical diagnosis of genetic deafness. However, molecular etiology of hearing impairment in the Tibetan Chinese population living in the Tibetan Plateau has not been investigated. To provide appropriate genetic testing and counseling to Tibetan families, we investigated molecular etiology of nonsyndromic deafness in this population.A total of 114 unrelated deaf Tibetan children from the Tibet Autonomous Region were enrolled. Five prominent deafness-related genes, GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB6, POU3F4, and mtDNA 12S rRNA, were analyzed. Inner ear development was evaluated by temporal CT. A total of 106 Tibetan hearing normal individuals were included as genetic controls. For radiological comparison, 120 patients, mainly of Han ethnicity, with sensorineural hearing loss were analyzed by temporal CT.None of the Tibetan patients carried diallelic GJB2 or SLC26A4 mutations. Two patients with a history of aminoglycoside usage carried homogeneous mtDNA 12S rRNA A1555G mutation. Two controls were homozygous for 12S rRNA A1555G. There were no mutations in GJB6 or POU3F4. A diagnosis of inner ear malformation was made in 20.18% of the Tibetan patients and 21.67% of the Han deaf group. Enlarged vestibular aqueduct, the most common inner ear deformity, was not found in theTibetan patients, but was seen in 18.33% of the Han patients. Common molecular etiologies, GJB2 and SLC26A4 mutations, were rare in the Tibetan Chinese deaf population.The mutation spectrum of hearing loss differs significantly between Chinese Tibetan patients and Han patients. The incidence of inner ear malformation in Tibetans is almost as high as that in Han deaf patients, but the types of malformation vary greatly. Hypoxia and special environment in plateau may be one cause of developmental inner ear deformity in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2003589737,"Over 130 million people are infected chronically with hepatitis C virus (HCV), which, together with HBV, is the leading cause of liver disease. Novel small molecule inhibitors of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are needed to complement or replace current treatments based on pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which are only partially successful and plagued with side-effects. Assembly of the virion is initiated by the oligomerization of core, the capsid protein, followed by the interaction with NS5A and other HCV proteins. By screening for inhibitors of core dimerization, we previously discovered peptides and drug-like compounds that disrupt interactions between core and other HCV proteins, NS3 and NS5A, and block HCV production. Here we report that a biotinylated derivative of SL209, a prototype small molecule inhibitor of core dimerization (IC50 of 2.80 µM) that inhibits HCV production with an EC50 of 3.20 µM, is capable of penetrating HCV-infected cells and tracking with core. Interaction between the inhibitors, core and other viral proteins was demonstrated by SL209–mediated affinity-isolation of HCV proteins from lysates of infected cells, or of the corresponding recombinant HCV proteins. SL209-like inhibitors of HCV core may form the basis of novel treatments of Hepatitis C in combination with other target-specific HCV drugs such as inhibitors of the NS3 protease, the NS5B polymerase, or the NS5A regulatory protein. More generally, our work supports the hypothesis that inhibitors of viral capsid formation might constitute a new class of potent antiviral agents, as was recently also shown for HIV capsid inhibitors."

In light of its activity-dependent generation in the principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), we have investigated its potential modulatory effects on native voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) within this nucleus. Whole-cell patch recordings were made from brain slices from P13–15 CBA mice. Slices were incubated with the inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) 7-nitroindazole (10 µM) and pharmacological blockers used to isolate Ca2+ current subtypes. Unpaired observations in the presence and absence of the NO-donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 100 µM) or Diethyl-ammonium-nonoate (DEA, 100 µM) were made to elucidate NO-dependent modulation of the expressed CaV subtypes. A differential effect of NO on the calcium channel subtypes was observed: CaV1 and CaV2.1 (L+R- and P/Q+R-type) conductances were potentiated, whereas N+R-type (CaV2.2) and R-type (CaV2.3) current amplitudes were unaffected. L+R-type currents increased from 0.36±0.04 nA to 0.64±0.11 nA and P/Q+R-type from 0.55±0.09 nA to 0.94±0.05 nA, thereby changing the balance and relative contribution of each subtype to the whole cell calcium current. In addition, N+R-type half-activation voltage was left shifted following NO exposure. NO-dependent modulation of P/Q+R and N+R-type, but not L+R-type, channels was removed by inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity. This data demonstrates a differential effect of NO signalling on voltage-gated calcium entry, by distinct NO-dependent pathways."

The complex is structurally well conserved, however, the functions of individual subunits and their regulation is poorly understood. Here we characterize the mutant phenotypes for the exocyst complex genes exoc-7 (exo70) and exoc-8 (exo84) in Caenorhabditis elegans. The mutants display pleiotropic behavior defects that resemble those observed in cilia mutants (slow growth, uncoordinated movement, defects in chemo-, mechano- and thermosensation). However, no obvious morphological defects in cilia were observed. A targeted RNAi screen for small GTPases identified eleven genes with enhanced phenotypes when combined with exoc-7, exoc-8 single and exoc-7;exoc-8 double mutants. The screen verified previously identified functional links between the exocyst complex and small GTPases and, in addition, identified several novel potential regulators of exocyst function. The exoc-8 and exoc-7;exoc-8 mutations caused a significant size increase in the rab-10 RNAi-induced endocytic vacuoles in the intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, exoc-8 and exoc-7;exoc-8 mutations resulted in up-regulation of RAB-10 expression and affected the accumulation of endocytic marker proteins in these cells in response to rab-10 RNAi.

Like native Max, Max-E47 binds with high affinity and specificity to the E-box site, 5'-CACGTG, both in vivo and in vitro. We have determined the crystal structure of Max-E47 at 1.7 Å resolution, and found that it associates to form a well-structured dimer even in the absence of its cognate DNA. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirms that Max-E47 is dimeric even at low micromolar concentrations, indicating that the Max-E47 dimer is stable in the absence of DNA. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that both non-specific DNA and the E-box site induce similar levels of helical secondary structure in Max-E47. These results suggest that Max-E47 may bind to the E-box following the two-step mechanism proposed for other bHLH proteins. In this mechanism, a rapid step where protein binds to DNA without sequence specificity is followed by a slow step where specific protein:DNA interactions are fine-tuned, leading to sequence-specific recognition. Collectively, these results show that the designed Max-E47 protein chimera behaves both structurally and functionally like its native counterparts."

Photon absorption leads to the photoisomerization of chromophores, resulting in the formation of activated metarhodopsin.

It is also critical for each step of the phototransduction cascade to be terminated appropriately, which is essential for the high temporal resolution of fly vision (9Montell C.

The most important step in phototransduction termination is the deactivation of metarhodopsin. During this step, arrestin (Arr2) plays an important role by displacing the Gq α subunit and allowing it to bind with rhodopsin (Rh1) (11Satoh A.K. Ready D.F.

Unlike other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the phosphorylation of fly rhodopsin is not required for its deactivation (13Scott K. Zuker C. Lights out: deactivation of the phototransduction cascade.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but is essential for its endocytosis (11Satoh A.K. Ready D.F. Arrestin1 mediates light-dependent rhodopsin endocytosis and cell survival.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1722-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the dephosphorylation of rhodopsin by retinal degeneration C (RDGC) is essential for receptor deactivation (14Vinós J. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Britt S.G. Zuker C.S.

Ca2+ also plays critical roles in regulating the termination of the photoresponse in Drosophila (8Ranganathan R. Harris G.L. Stevens C.F. Zuker C.S.

It has been shown that the loss of DGq leads to the slow termination of the light response (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that the metarhodopsin/Gq interaction affects subsequent Arr2-Rh1 binding, which mediates the deactivation of metarhodopsin. Our study has characterized the role of Gq in photoresponse termination. This pathway represents a general rapid feedback regulation in GPCR signaling. The genotype of wild-type flies is cn,bw. sast mutants were generated with the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in cn,bw background, and all flies were put into cn,bw background to eliminate the effects of eye color. The mutant alleles used for each gene in this work are ninaE8, Gαq1, and norpA24. To avoid age-dependent retinal degeneration, all flies were reared at 22 °C in dark and examined when they were 2–3 days old. The Gαq mutant and p[hs::dGαq] transgenic fly were obtained from the C. Zuker laboratory, and all other flies used in this work were from the Bloomington Stock Center. The deficiency line Df(2R)Exel7121 was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center and recombined into FRT 42D background. Genetic mosaics were induced by the FLP-FRT p[GMR-hid] technique with an ey-FLP driver to generate mitotic clones of a single genotype in the eye (21Stowers R.S. Schwarz T.L. A genetic method for generating Drosophila eyes composed exclusively of mitotic clones of a single genotype.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate GqH212A transgenic flies, a mutate dGq cDNA, which mutate His212 to Ala, was subcloned into pUAST vector and then injected into w1118 flies. The transgene was subsequently crossed into the Gαq1 and Gαq961 mutant background, respectively. GqH212A protein was expressed by using eye-specific driver (p[gmr::GAL4]). Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings were performed as described previously (22Han J. Gong P. Reddig K. Mitra M. Guo P. Li H.S. The fly CAMTA transcription factor potentiates deactivation of rhodopsin, a G protein-coupled light receptor.Cell. 2006; 127: 847-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, fly eyes were stimulated with 5-s light pulses (4000 lux). For each genotype and condition, >10 flies were examined. To quantitate the speed of response termination, the time required for half-recovery was measured, and the S.E. was calculated. t½ was defined as the time required for a half-recovery from the responses upon stimulation cessation. Prolonged depolarization afterpotentials were examined using the same setup except with different color filters and light intensities. Relative light sensitivity measurement was carried out as described previously (23Cao J. Li Y. Xia W. Reddig K. Hu W. Xie W. Li H.S. Han J. A Drosophila metallophosphoesterase mediates deglycosylation of rhodopsin.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3701-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For each genotype and condition, 10 flies were examined, and the relative sensitivities were averaged to obtain a mean. The S.E. were calculated and presented as error bars in the figures. Intracellular recordings were performed as described previously (24Han J. Reddig K. Li H.S. Prolonged Gq activity triggers fly rhodopsin endocytosis and degradation, and reduces photoreceptor sensitivity.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, a low resistance glass microelectrode filled with 2 m KCl was placed into a small hole on the compound eye. A reference electrode was filled with Ringer's solution and inside the eye at the retina layer. The microelectrode placed on the eye was gradually inserted into the opening until light-induced membrane depolarization was observed. The signal was amplified and recorded using a Warner IE210 Intracellular Electrometer. Fly heads were homogenized in SDS-sample buffer, and the proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Pall) in Tris-glycine buffer. The blots were probed with mouse anti-Rh1 antibodies (1:3000 dilution, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), rabbit anti-Gβe antibodies (1:2000 dilution) (25Schulz S. Huber A. Schwab K. Paulsen R. A novel Gγ isolated from Drosophila constitutes a visual G protein γ subunit of the fly compound eye.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37605-37610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Gαq antibodies (1:2000 dilution, Calbiochem), rabbit anti-N-Gαq antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Abcam), rabbit anti-Arr2 antibodies (1:1000 dilution), rabbit anti-INAD antibodies (1:1000 dilution). The blots were subsequently probed with either anti-rabbit, mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (GE Healthcare), and the signals were detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Fly heads were immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 7.2) at 4 °C for 12 h. After rinsing three times with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, the fixed tissue was stained with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. A standard ethanol dehydration series was performed, and tissue was immersed in two 10-min washes of propylene oxide. The tissue was then embedded using standard procedures. For electron microscopy, thin sections (100 nm) were cut, collected on copper support grids, and stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate staining. Micrographs were taken at 80 kV on Hitachi-7650. For immunofluorescence staining of Rh1 and Arr2, fly heads were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, dehydrated with acetone, and embedded in LR White resin. One-micrometer sections were cut and double stained with anti-Rh1 antibody, 4C5 (1:100, DSHB), and anti-Arr2 antibody (1:400). Arr2 binding assays were performed as described previously with a minor modification (26Alloway P.G. Dolph P.J. A role for the light-dependent phosphorylation of visual arrestin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For each group and condition, eight adults were collected and adapted with food in complete dark for >2 h. After exposure for 60 s to pure blue light (480 ± 10 nm), fly heads were isolated by liquid nitrogen and homogenized in the dark. After centrifuging at 14,600 × g for 5 min, pellet and supernatant fractions were separated under very dim red light for Western blotting analysis. Arr2 release assays were performed in the same manner, except that the flies were exposed to 60 s of pure blue light followed by 2 min of pure orange light (580 ± 10 nm). For each quantitative analysis, the images of Western blots and immunostaining were quantified using ImageJ software. After averaging three sets of data, the mean values ± S.E. (as error bars) are presented. To characterize the components of the phototransduction machinery, we performed an ERG-based chemical mutagenesis screen for additional genes in the fly. We isolated a mutant fly, sast (small amplify and slow termination), which shows small ERG responses (3.7 ± 0.3 mV versus 11.2 ± 0.4 mV) and slow photoresponse termination (t½ = 1.02 ± 0.22 s versus t½ = 0.06 ± 0.01 s) compared with wild-type flies (Fig. 1, A–C). In addition, sast mutant displays the reduced ON transient and OFF transient (Fig. 1, A and D). The light sensitivity of this mutant is also significantly reduced (Fig. 1E). Intracellular recording further revealed that the defective light response in sast mutants was due to an abnormality in photoreceptor cells (Fig. 1F). To identify the specific mutation in sast flies, we first mapped the mutation to the 49B5–49B12 chromosomal region based on the ERG phenotype covered by the deficient chromosome Df(2R)Exel7121 (missing 49B5–10 to 49B12) (Fig. 2A). This genomic region contains 26 genes, including Gα49B, which encodes the Gq protein. Because the mutant flies showed an ERG phenotype similar to that of the Gαq1 mutants, the sast mutant might harbor a Gαq mutant allele. The sast/Gαq1 flies displayed an ERG phenotype similar to that of either the sast or Gαq1 mutant (Fig. 2B), supporting this conclusion. A previous study showed that the Gα49B gene encodes several DGq splice variants (27Ratnaparkhi A. Banerjee S. Hasan G. Altered levels of Gq activity modulate axonal pathfinding in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that DGq1 plays a predominant role in phototransduction in Drosophila (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that recognizes DGq1, we revealed that the DGq1 protein is absent in sast mutants (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, other phototransduction proteins were present at normal levels (Fig. 2D). Subsequent DNA sequencing revealed that the sast mutant contains a C961T mutation in the Gα49B gene (Fig. 2E). This mutation corresponds to a nonsense mutation (Arg117 to stop codon) in exon 4 (amino acids 153–196 of DGq1; Fig. 2E), which is not included in the DGq3 and DGq4 variants (27Ratnaparkhi A. Banerjee S. Hasan G. Altered levels of Gq activity modulate axonal pathfinding in Drosophila.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4499-4508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the sast mutant retains any truncated DGq1 protein, we performed Western blotting with an antibody against the N terminus of DGq1. We could not detect any truncated DGq1 protein, suggesting that the sast mutant is likely to possess one Gαq1-null allele (Fig. 2F). Therefore, we named the sast mutant Gαq961. Because Gαq961 is a Gαq1-null mutant and DGq1 plays a predominant role in phototransduction in Drosophila, we worried whether the residual light response observed in the Gαq961 mutant was evoked by either DGq3 or DGq4 variants. To detect DGq3 and DGq4 protein in both Gq1 and Gαq961 mutants, we performed Western blotting by using the anti-Gq α subunit antibody (371754; Calbiochem) that also recognizes DGq3 and DGq4 variants. Unfortunately, we did not detect any DGq3 or DGq4 in either Gq1 and Gαq961 mutants even loading with 32 isolated retinas (data not shown). This observation implied that the expressions of DGq3 or DGq4 in the retina were extremely low and the residual light response in the Gαq961 mutant might be attributable to other G protein genes, but not the Gq49B gene. To further support this hypothesis, we generated clones of Gα49B-nulls in the retina through ey-FLP-induced FRT recombination in deficiency line, Df(2R)Exel7121, which deletes the whole Gα49B gene. This fly also showed small light response and slow termination ERG phenotype (supplemental Fig. 2). This observation indicates that the residual light response observed in the Gαq961 mutant is contributed by other G protein, but not DGq3 or DGq4. To further confirm that the absence of the DGq1 protein is indeed responsible for the Gαq961 mutant phenotype, we performed rescue experiments by expressing DGq1 protein in a Gαq961 mutant background. After induction of heat shock, the levels of the DGq1 protein were recovered (Fig. 2G), and ERG responses were restored in Gαq961;p[hs-dGαq] flies (Fig. 2H). These results illuminate that the loss of DGq1 leads to light response defects in Gαq961 flies. In the rescue experiments, we observed that the deactivation kinetics of the photoresponse correlated with the available amount of DGq protein. In Gαq961;p[hs-dGαq] flies, in vivo DGq protein levels could be manipulated by controlling the time of heat shock. Within 30 min of heat shock at 37 °C, DGq protein levels were partial recovered (14.2 ± 1.3%, Fig. 3A), accompanied by an increase in the termination speed (t½ = 0.47 ± 0.08, Fig. 3B). Extended heat shock induced further increases in the levels of DGq protein (22.4 ± 1.7%, Fig. 3A) and triggered rapid termination (t½ = 0.11 ± 0.01, Fig. 3B). We excluded the possibility that the increased termination speed was due to the heat-shock treatment, because the heat-shock treatment did not change the protein level of DGq and the termination speed in wild-type flies (Fig. 3B, right, and supplemental Fig. 3). These data suggest that termination speed depends on the available amount of the DGq protein. Previous work has shown that Gαq1 mutants generate quantum bumps with prolonged latency (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is possible that the slow termination phenotype reflects a slow activation process. To test this hypothesis, we generated a variant DGqH212A transgenic fly with a mutated His212 to Ala, resulting in a loss of capacity of Gq to activate PLC (28Waldo G.L. Ricks T.K. Hicks S.N. Cheever M.L. Kawano T. Tsuboi K. Wang X. Montell C. Kozasa T. Sondek J. Harden T.K. Kinetic scaffolding mediated by a phospholipase Cβ and Gq signaling complex.Science. 2010; 330: 974-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In cn,Gαq961,bw; gmr>DGqH212A flies, the levels of variant DGqH212A protein were comparable with the levels of Gq protein in wild-type flies (supplemental Fig. 4). Interestingly, deactivation kinetics, but not ERG amplitude, was nearly restored in this fly (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the slow termination phenotype in Gαq mutants is not due to delayed bump generation. During fly photoresponse termination, metarhodopsin deactivation is the most important step (29Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, we first investigated whether DGq was required for the deactivation of metarhodopsin. Prolonged depolarization afterpotential (PDA) is induced when the number of activated rhodopsin molecules exceeds the number of available regulators (29Dolph P.J. Ranganathan R. Colley N.J. Hardy R.W. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Arrestin function in inactivation of G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Science. 1993; 260: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In mutants lacking rhodopsin regulators, because lower amounts of rhodopsin need to be activated, the light intensity required to induce PDA is much lower than that in wild-type flies (14Vinós J. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Britt S.G. Zuker C.S. A G protein-coupled receptor phosphatase required for rhodopsin function.Science. 1997; 277: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The minimum light intensity needed to induce PDA was approximately 420 lux in Gαq961 versus approximately 2,600 lux in wild-type and 2300 lux in cn,Gαq961,bw;P[hs::Gαq] flies (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, this result suggests that the deactivation of metarhodopsin is impaired and that there is a shortage of rhodopsin regulator molecules in Gαq961 mutant. Because the deactivation of metarhodopsin is impaired in Gαq961 mutants, we attempted to increase the termination speed of Gαq961 photoresponses by reducing the level of Rh1, the major rhodopsin in all outer (R1–R6) photoreceptor cells. We genetically reduced Rh1 levels via the introduction of ninaE8, which contains <1% Rh1 protein (30Scavarda N.J. O'tousa J. Pak W.L. Drosophila locus with gene-dosage effects on rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1983; 80: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), into a Gαq961 background. Because much less Rh1 need to be deactivated, the impaired regulating machinery might be sufficient for the deactivation of rhodopsin, and the termination speed of the photoresponse should be faster in Gαq961;ninaE8 double mutants compared with that in the Gαq961 single mutant. Indeed, in Gαq961;ninaE8 double mutants, the deactivation of the photoresponse was much faster than that in the Gαq961 single mutant (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that DGq is required for the deactivation of metarhodopsin. Because Arr2 is the primary deactivator of rhodopsin through its binding with rhodopsin (11Satoh A.K. Ready D.F. Arrestin1 mediates light-dependent rhodopsin endocytosis and cell survival.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1722-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Ranganathan R. Stevens C.F. Arrestin binding determines the rate of inactivation of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin in vivo.Cell. 1995; 81: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we next assessed whether Gq mediates the deactivation of metarhodopsin by affecting Arr2-Rh1 binding. To characterize the Arr2/Rh1 interaction, we used an arrestin pelleting assay (31Kiselev A. Subramaniam S. Studies of Rh1 metarhodopsin stabilization in wild-type Drosophila and in mutants lacking one or both arrestins.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2188-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. The formation of stable rhodopsin-arrestin complexes induces apoptosis and photoreceptor cell degeneration.Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Upon 30 s of blue light stimulation, >80% Arr2 binds to metarhodopsin in wild-type flies, whereas only 52% Arr2 binds to metarhodopsin in the Gαq961 mutant (80.1 ± 3.2% versus 52.3 ± 4.3%, Fig. 5A, middle panel). Immunostaining results were consistent with those of the arrestin pelleting assay (Fig. 5B). These observations suggest that DGq indeed affects Arr2-Rh1 binding. Because Gq functions as a molecular switch on phototransduction cascade, we next investigated whether Gq affects Arr2-Rh1 binding by activating the phototransduction cascades. In cn,Gαq961,bw;grm>GqH212A flies, phototransduction cascade cannot be activated by the variant DGqH212A (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the minimum light intensity needed to induce PDA in this fly (2200 ± 300 lux) was comparable with that in wild-type flies (2600 ± 200 lux) (Fig. 6A), reflecting the normal Arr2-Rh1 binding. An Arr2-binding assay further showed that Arr2-Rh1 binding is normal in these flies (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, Arr2-Rh1 binding is normal in norpA mutants, which also show defects in the activation of phototransduction (Fig. 6C) (33Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Isolation of a putative phospholipase C gene of Drosophila, norpA, and its role in phototransduction.Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the metarhodopsin/Gq interaction, but not the activation of the phototransduction cascade, affects Arr2-Rh1 binding. In Drosophila, mutations in almost any gene involved in the phototransduction cascade lead to light-dependent retinal degeneration (34Wang T. Montell C. Phototransduction and retinal degeneration in Drosophila.Pflugers Arch. 2007; 454: 821-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the Gαq961 mutant and Gαq1 mutant also undergo retinal degeneration. An EM study showed obvious retinal degeneration in older mutants but not in 6-day-old mutants (Fig. 7, A, B, D, E, G, and H). Additionally, 21-day-old dark-reared mutants did not undergo retinal degeneration (Fig. 7, C, F, and I). These observations indicate that Gαq961 mutants and the Gαq1 mutant undergo slow light-dependent retinal degeneration. PLCβ, encoded by norpA, is the downstream effector of Gq (33Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Isolation of a putative phospholipase C gene of Drosophila, norpA, and its role in phototransduction.Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). A loss of PLC results in the formation of stable Arr2-Rh1 complexes, which trigger retinal degeneration (32Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. The formation of stable rhodopsin-arrestin complexes induces apoptosis and photoreceptor cell degeneration.Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined whether the same mechanism causes retinal degeneration in the Gαq961 mutant. With 480-nm blue light exposure, Rh1 is photoconverted to metarhodopsin and induces binding with Arr2. Metarhodopsin can be photoconverted to inactivated rhodopsin, leading to the release of Arr2 (32Alloway P.G. Howard L. Dolph P.J. The formation of stable rhodopsin-arrestin complexes induces apoptosis and photoreceptor cell degeneration.Neuron. 2000; 28: 129-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In wild-type flies, blue light exposure caused >80% binding between Arr2 and Rh1 and >80% release of Arr2 from Rh1 following exposure to orange light (Fig. 7, J and K). In contrast, in the mutant, blue light exposure only triggered approximate 48.5% binding between Arr2 and Rh1, and <60% release of Arr2 from Rh1 following exposure to orange light (Fig. 7, J and K). These data imply that the formation of stable Arr2-Rh1 complexes might trigger retinal degeneration in the Gαq mutant. Our work isolated and identified a novel Gαq mutant allele and demonstrated that metarhodopsin/Gq interaction affects subsequent Arr2-Rh1 binding, which might mediate the deactivation of metarhodopsin. Our study revealed the involvement of a general rapid feedback regulation in GPCR signaling. Rapid termination of the light response is critical for fly vision to achieve high temporal resolution and to prevent excessive calcium-induced cell toxicity (9Montell C. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 231-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 10Hardie R.C. Raghu P. Visual transduction in Drosophila.Nature. 2001; 413: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Using an ERG-based chemical mutagenesis screen, we isolated a novel Gαq mutant allele, Gαq961, which shows defects in the termination of the light response. A similar phenotype has been reported in another Gαq mutant allele, Gαq1 (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Compared with the Gαq1 mutant, Gαq961 showed even more severe defects in photoresponse deactivation. One explanation is that Gαq961 mutants contain an even lower amount of Gq protein than that found in Gαq1 mutants. Western blotting revealed that the Gαq961 mutant is likely a null mutant. In contrast, Gαq1 mutants produce approximately 1% of wild-type levels of the DGq protein (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This explanation is further supported by rescue experiments, which showed that the termination kinetics depend on the amount of available Gq protein. A previous study showed that the absence of Gq leads to the generation of quantum bumps with prolonged latency (4Scott K. Becker A. Sun Y. Hardy R. Zuker C. Gqα protein function in vivo: genetic dissection of its role in photoreceptor cell physiology.Neuron. 1995; 15: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) because it takes longer for rare residual Gq to encounter metarhodopsin. In this study, we provided evidence that the slow termination phenotype of the Gαq mutants was not due to slow activation. Expression of DGqH212A, which can bind metarhodopsin but cannot activate PLC, is nearly able to restore the defects of photoresponse termination in a Gαq961 mutant background. In Gαq961;gmr>GqH212A flies, the termination speed of the photoresponse is slower than that in wild-type flies, which might be attributed to slow activation and impaired calcium-dependent receptor deactivation mechanisms (35Liu C.H. Satoh A.K. Postma M. Huang J. Ready D.F. Hardie R.C. Ca2+-dependent metarhodopsin inactivation mediated by calmodulin and NINAC myosin III.Neuron. 2008; 59: 778-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Combined with genetic, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches, we showed that metarhodopsin/Gq interaction affects subsequent Arr2-Rh1 binding. Using the arrestin pelleting assay, we showed that more Arr2 binds to metarhodopsin in wild-type flies than that in the Gαq961 mutant upon blue light stimulation (80.1 ± 3.2% versus 52.3 ± 4.3%). Although some of the Arr2 can still bind with Rh1 in the Gαq961 mutant, the metarhodopsin/Gq interaction clearly affects subsequent Arr2-Rh1 binding, which mediates the deactivation of photoresponse. This conclusion is further supported by the observations in cn,Gαq961,bw;grm>GqH212A flies. We showed the rapid deactivation kinetics of ERG, normal Arr2-Rh1 binding, and comparable minimum light intensity needed to induce PDA in this fly. This rapid feedback regulation does not need to activate the entire phototransduction cascade and allows the termination of photoreceptors with extremely fast kinetics, permitting adaptation in a huge dynamic range of light intensities (10Hardie R.C.

Such regulation also prevents excessive Ca2+ influx and Ca2+-dependent excitotoxicity during intensive stimulation (37Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P.

It is possible that the metarhodopsin/Gq interaction exposes the binding site in metarhodopsin or shifts metarhodopsin into an intermediate metarhodopsin status, which facilitates Arr2-Rh1 binding. Using fluorescence pump probe and time-resolved fluorescence depolarization measurement approaches, it has been shown that helix 8 of rhodopsin undergoes dynamic changes at the receptor surface, which modulates arrestin-rhodopsin binding (41Kirchberg K. Kim T.Y. Möller M. Skegro D. Dasara Raju G. Granzin J. Büldt G. Schlesinger R. Alexiev U. Conformational dynamics of helix 8 in the GPCR rhodopsin controls arrestin activation in the desensitization process.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18690-18695Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the phosphorylation of rhodopsin is important for β-arrestin/rhodopsin binding. GPCR kinase 2 has been shown to undergo selective binding with the Gq α subunit (42Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T.

These results indicate that the rhodopsin/Gq interaction might mediate arrestin-rhodopsin binding via the promotion of rhodopsin phosphorylation. However, this is not the case in the deactivation of the photoresponse in the fly because the phosphorylation of metarhodopsin is not required for Arr2-Rh1 binding in fly photoreceptors (14Vinós J.

In this study, we showed that the Gαq961 mutant undergoes slow light-dependent retinal degeneration, similar to that observed in the Gαq1 mutant (44Iakhine R. Chorna-Ornan I. Zars T. Elia N. Cheng Y.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We provided evidence that mild retinal degeneration in the Gαq961 mutant was due to the slow accumulation of stable Arr2-Rh1 complexes, which trigger retinal degeneration (32Alloway P.G. Howard L.

Light stimulation triggers Ca2+ influx and activates CaM kinase II, which phosphorylates Arr2 and results in Arr2 release from Rh1 (26Alloway P.G. Dolph P.J.

In the Gαq961 mutant, impaired Ca2+ influx leads to the slow release of Arr2 from Rh1. On the other hand, lack of Gq partially inhibits basal Rh1 endocytosis (24Han J. Reddig K. Li H.S. Prolonged Gq activity triggers fly rhodopsin endocytosis and degradation, and reduces photoreceptor sensitivity.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4966-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and inhibits the translocation of Arr2 to rhabdomeres (46Satoh A.K.

https://openalex.org/W2051438463,"The amphibian pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been implicated in amphibian declines around the globe. Although it has been found in most countries in Central America, its presence has never been assessed in Belize. We set out to determine the range, prevalence, and diversity of Bd using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and sequencing of a portion of the 5.8 s and ITS1-2 regions. Swabs were collected from 524 amphibians of at least 26 species in the protected areas of the Maya Mountains of Belize. We sequenced a subset of 72 samples that had tested positive for Bd by qPCR at least once; 30 samples were verified as Bd. Eight unique Bd haplotypes were identified in the Maya Mountains, five of which were previously undescribed. We identified unique ecological niches for the two most broadly distributed haplotypes. Combined with data showing differing virulence shown in different strains in other studies, the 5.8 s - ITS1-2 region diversity found in this study suggests that there may be substantial differences among populations or haplotypes. Future work should focus on whether specific haplotypes for other genomic regions and possibly pathogenicity can be associated with haplotypes at this locus, as well as the integration of molecular tools with other ecological tools to elucidate the ecology and pathogenicity of Bd."
https://openalex.org/W2065420597,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/Apo2 ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) selectively induces apoptosis in various cancer cells including myeloma (MM) cells. However, the susceptibility of MM cells to TRAIL is largely low in most of MM cells by yet largely unknown mechanisms. Because TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) can cleave some TNF receptor family members, in the present study we explored the roles of proteolytic modulation by TACE in TRAIL receptor expression and TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity in MM cells.MM cells preferentially expressed death receptor 4 (DR4) but not DR5 on their surface along with TACE. Conditioned media from RPMI8226 and U266 cells contained a soluble form of DR4. The DR4 levels in these conditioned media were reduced by TACE inhibition by the TACE inhibitor TAPI-0 as well as TACE siRNA. Conversely, the TACE inhibition restored surface levels of DR4 but not DR5 in these cells without affecting DR4 mRNA levels. The TACE inhibition was able to restore cell surface DR4 expression in MM cells even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells or osteoclasts, and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of recombinant TRAIL and an agonistic antibody against DR4 on MM cells.These results demonstrate that MM cells post-translationally down-modulate the cell surface expression of DR4 through ectodomain shedding by endogenous TACE, and that TACE inhibition is able to restore cell surface DR4 levels and the susceptibility of MM cells to TRAIL or an agonistic antibody against DR4. Thus, TACE may protect MM cells from TRAIL-mediated death through down-modulation of cell-surface DR4. It can be envisaged that TACE inhibition augments clinical efficacy of TRAIL-based immunotherapy against MM, which eventually becomes resistant to the present therapeutic modalities."
https://openalex.org/W2022026976,"The capsid proteins of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have five conserved cysteine residues. Structural analysis of AAV serotype 2 reveals that Cys289 and Cys361 are located adjacent to each other within each monomer, while Cys230 and Cys394 are located on opposite edges of each subunit and juxtaposed at the pentamer interface. The Cys482 residue is located at the base of a surface loop within the trimer region. Although plausible based on molecular dynamics simulations, intra- or inter-subunit disulfides have not been observed in structural studies. In the current study, we generated a panel of Cys-to-Ser mutants to interrogate the potential for disulfide bond formation in AAV capsids. The C289S, C361S and C482S mutants were similar to wild type AAV with regard to titer and transduction efficiency. However, AAV capsid protein subunits with C230S or C394S mutations were prone to proteasomal degradation within the host cells. Proteasomal inhibition partially blocked degradation of mutant capsid proteins, but failed to rescue infectious virions. While these results suggest that the Cys230/394 pair is critical, a C394V mutant was found viable, but not the corresponding C230V mutant. Although the exact nature of the structural contribution(s) of Cys230 and Cys394 residues to AAV capsid formation remains to be determined, these results support the notion that disulfide bond formation within the Cys289/361 or Cys230/394 pair appears to be nonessential. These studies represent an important step towards understanding the role of inter-subunit interactions that drive AAV capsid assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2006001746,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A (IP(3)K-A) is a brain specific and F-actin-binding protein. We recently demonstrated that IP(3)K-A modulates a structural reorganization of dendritic spines through F-actin remodeling, which is required for synaptic plasticity and memory formation in brain. However, detailed functions of IP(3)K-A and its regulatory mechanisms involved in the neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics still remain unknown. In the present study, we identified tubulin as a candidate of IP(3)K-A-binding protein through proteomic screening. By various in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrated that IP(3)K-A was a novel microtubule-associated protein (MAP), and the N terminus of IP(3)K-A was a critical region for direct binding to tubulin in dendritic shaft of hippocampal neurons. Moreover, PKA phosphorylated Ser-119 within IP(3)K-A, leading to a significant reduction of microtubule binding affinity. These results suggest that PKA-dependent phosphorylation and microtubule binding of IP(3)K-A are involved in its regulatory mechanism for activity-dependent neuronal events such as local calcium signaling and its synaptic targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2033532094,"Constant sound sequencing as operationalized by repeated stimulation with tones of the same frequency has multiple effects. On the one hand, it activates mechanisms of habituation and refractoriness, which are reflected in the decrease of response amplitude of evoked responses. On the other hand, the constant sequencing acts as spectral cueing, resulting in tones being detected faster and more accurately. With the present study, by means of magnetoencephalography, we investigated the impact of repeated tone stimulation on the N1m auditory evoked fields, while listeners were distracted from the test sounds. We stimulated subjects with trains of either four tones of the same frequency, or with trains of randomly assigned frequencies. The trains were presented either in a silent or in a noisy background. In silence, the patterns of source strength decline originating from repeated stimulation suggested both, refractoriness as well as habituation as underlying mechanisms. In noise, in contrast, there was no indication of source strength decline. Furthermore, we found facilitating effects of constant sequencing regarding the detection of the single tones as indexed by a shortening of N1m latency. We interpret our findings as a correlate of a bottom-up mechanism that is constantly monitoring the incoming auditory information, even when voluntary attention is directed to a different modality."
https://openalex.org/W2067004497,"Facial recognition is key to social interaction, however with unfamiliar faces only generic information, in the form of facial stereotypes such as gender and age is available. Therefore is generic information more prominent in unfamiliar versus familiar face processing? In order to address the question we tapped into two relatively disparate stages of face processing. At the early stages of encoding, we employed perceptual masking to reveal that only perception of unfamiliar face targets is affected by the gender of the facial masks. At the semantic end; using a priming paradigm, we found that while to-be-ignored unfamiliar faces prime lexical decisions to gender congruent stereotypic words, familiar faces do not. Our findings indicate that gender is a more salient dimension in unfamiliar relative to familiar face processing, both in early perceptual stages as well as later semantic stages of person construal."
https://openalex.org/W2080602046,"Major depression is nearly twice as prevalent in women compared to men. In bipolar disorder, depressive episodes have been reported to be more common amongst female patients. Furthermore, periods of depression often correlate with periods of hormonal fluctuations. A link between hormone signaling and these mood disorders has, therefore, been suggested to exist in many studies. Estrogen, one of the primary female sex hormones, mediates its effect mostly by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs). Nuclear ERs function as transcription factors and regulate gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences. A nucleotide change in the binding sequence might alter the binding efficiency, which could affect transcription levels of nearby genes. In order to investigate if variation in ER DNA-binding sequences may be involved in mood disorders, we conducted a genome-wide study of ER DNA-binding in patients diagnosed with major depression or bipolar disorder. Association studies were performed within each gender separately and the results were corrected for multiple testing by the Bonferroni method. In the female bipolar disorder material a significant association result was found for rs6023059 (corrected p-value = 0.023; odds ratio (OR) 0.681, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.570-0.814), a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) placed downstream of the gene coding for transglutaminase 2 (TGM2). Thus, females with a specific genotype at this SNP may be more vulnerable to fluctuating estrogen levels, which may then act as a triggering factor for bipolar disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2005703419,"The authors propose a CT image segmentation method using structural analysis that is useful for objects with structural dynamic characteristics. Motivation of our research is from the area of genetic activity. In order to reveal the roles of genes, it is necessary to create mutant mice and measure differences among them by scanning their skeletons with an X-ray CT scanner. The CT image needs to be manually segmented into pieces of the bones. It is a very time consuming to manually segment many mutant mouse models in order to reveal the roles of genes. It is desirable to make this segmentation procedure automatic. Although numerous papers in the past have proposed segmentation techniques, no general segmentation method for skeletons of living creatures has been established. Against this background, the authors propose a segmentation method based on the concept of destruction analogy. To realize this concept, structural analysis is performed using the finite element method (FEM), as structurally weak areas can be expected to break under conditions of stress. The contribution of the method is its novelty, as no studies have so far used structural analysis for image segmentation. The method's implementation involves three steps. First, finite elements are created directly from the pixels of a CT image, and then candidates are also selected in areas where segmentation is thought to be appropriate. The second step involves destruction analogy to find a single candidate with high strain chosen as the segmentation target. The boundary conditions for FEM are also set automatically. Then, destruction analogy is implemented by replacing pixels with high strain as background ones, and this process is iterated until object is decomposed into two parts. Here, CT image segmentation is demonstrated using various types of CT imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2039793324,"A neural model is described of how spontaneous retinal waves are formed in infant mammals, and how these waves organize activity-dependent development of a topographic map in the lateral geniculate nucleus, with connections from each eye segregated into separate anatomical layers. The model simulates the spontaneous behavior of starburst amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells during the production of retinal waves during the first few weeks of mammalian postnatal development. It proposes how excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms within individual cells, such as Ca2+-activated K+ channels, and cAMP currents and signaling cascades, can modulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of waves, notably by controlling the after-hyperpolarization currents of starburst amacrine cells. Given the critical role of the geniculate map in the development of visual cortex, these results provide a foundation for analyzing the temporal dynamics whereby the visual cortex itself develops."

A novel model for the mechanism driving the nascent chain motion is hereby presented, in which the ~180o rotatory motion performed by each C-terminal amino acid of the nascent chain during its translocation from the A site to the P site, is suggested to twist the newly formed peptide bond into cis conformation. By catalyzing the cis to trans isomerization, the ribosome is proposed to release the potential energy stored within the cis conformer and to utilize it to push the chain down the tunnel, thus operating as a molecular motor.
