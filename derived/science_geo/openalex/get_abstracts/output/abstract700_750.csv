https://openalex.org/W1887017620,"The ionophorous properties of a new antibiotic, ionomycin, have been studied. It was found that the antibiotic is capable of extracting calcium ion from the bulk of an aqueous phase into an organic phase. The antibiotic also acts as a mobile ion carrier to transport the cation across a solvent barrier. The divalent cation selectivity order for ionomycin as determined by ion competition experiments was found to be: Ca greater than Mg greater than Sr = Ba, where the binding of strontium and barium by the antibiotic is insignificant. The antibiotic also binds La3+ to some extent, but its complexation with monovalent alkali metal ions is negligible. Measurement of the binding of ionomycin with Ca2+ indicates that ionomycin complexes and transports calcium ion in a one to one stoichiometry."

https://openalex.org/W1989851808,"Silicone pellets containing d-amphetamine base were implanted subcutaneously in rats. These pellets release amphetamine continuously for at least 10 days. Several days after implantation, swollen dopamine axons concomitant with large decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase activity were observed in the caudate nucleus. Decreased tyrosine hydroxylase activity was still present 110 days after pellet removal in the caudate but not in several other brain regions, nor in the caudate of rats injected with an equivalent amount of amphetamine in daily injections. This implies that continuous amphetamine administration has a selective neurotoxic effect on dopamine terminals in the caudate."

https://openalex.org/W1991948574,"ATTEMPTS to identify an easily measured cell surface marker that would detect activation of T or B lymphocytes in a variety of species have been unsuccessful. Although insulin receptors have been identified for fat, liver, skeletal and cardiac muscle, fibroblasts and monocytes1–8, quiescent rat splenic T lymphocytes do not bear such receptors. However, insulin receptors do emerge on T lymphocytes after concanavalin A treatment or allogeneic skin grafting9,10. Following our work on characterising a lymphocyte insulin receptor which participates in the modulation of immune response11, we have examined and report here the possibility that the emergence of a membrane-bound receptor for the peptide hormone insulin may be a universal marker for activated T and B lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1504963268,"The oxidation-reduction potential values for the two electron transfers to glucose oxidase were obtained at pH 5.3, where the neutral radical is the stable form, and at pH 9.3, where the anion radical is the stable form. The midpoint potentials at 25 degrees were: pH 5.3 EFl1ox + e- H+ equilibrium EFlH. Em1 = -0.063 +/- 0.011 V EFlH. + e- + H+ equilibrium EFlredH2 Em2 = -0.065 +/- 0.007 V pH 9.3 EFlox + e- EFi- Em1 = -0.200 +/- 0.010 V EFi- + e- + H+ equilibrium EFlredH- Em2 = -0.240 +/- 0.005 V All potentials were measured versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The potentials indicated that glucose oxidase radicals are stabilized by kinetic factors and not by thermodynamic energy barriers. The pK for the glucose oxidase radical was 7.28 from dead time stopped flow measurements and the extinction coefficient of the neutral semiquinone was 4140 M-1 cm-1 at 570 nm. Both radical forms reacted with oxygen in a second order fashion. The rate at 25 degrees for the neutral semiquinone was 1.4 X 10(4) M-1 s-1; that for the anion radical was 3.5 X 10(4) M-1 s-1. The rate of oxidation of the neutral radical changed by a factor of 9 for a temperature difference of 22 degrees. For the anion radical, the oxidation rate changed by a factor of 6 for a 22 degrees change in temperature. We studied the oxygen reactivity of the 2-electron reduced form of the enzyme over a wide wavelength range and failed to detect either oxygenated flavin derivatives or semiquinoid forms as intermediates. The rate of reoxidation of fully reduced glucose oxidase at pH 9.3 was dependent on ionic strength."

A specific defect of ecto-5′-nucleotidase is further suggested by normal values for lymphocyte ecto-adenosinetriphosphatase and ecto-nonspecific phosphatase. The data provide evidence for an enzyme deficiency in this X-linked, B lymphocyte deficiency syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1500912019,"Prolylcarboxypeptidase was purified from human kidney 1200-fold with 18% yield. The enzyme had no cathepsin A activity and appeared to be homogeneous in gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of prolylcarboxypeptidase was estimated to be 115,000 by gel filtration. Under denaturing conditions the enzyme dissociated into subunits of 45,000 and 66,500 molecular weight. The enzyme cleaved benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)-Pro-Phe, representing the COOH-terminal end of angiotensin II and des-Asp1-angiotensin II (angiotensin III), at a rate of 31 micronmol/h/mg of protein. The rate of hydrolysis increased when phenylalanine in the N-protected dipeptide was replaced with alanine, valine, or leucine or when the octapeptide angiotensin II or the heptapeptide angiotensin III were the substrates. The enzyme also cleaved the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin (Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II). The Km values were 1 mM, 2mM, and 0.77 mM with Cbz-Pro-Phe, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III, respectively. The enzyme had an acid pH optimum (4.5 to 5.5), but hydrolyzed angiotensin III at pH 7 at 50% of the optimal rate. Prolylcarboxypeptidase was inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and pepstatin, but not by sequestering agents or -SH reagents."

The nature of the inhibition is by competition with the pterin cofactor and thus resembles feedback inhibition of the enzyme by catecholamines."

https://openalex.org/W1518284455,"The molecular structure of chick embryo fibroblast cell surface protein has been investigated by ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and fluorescence. Most measurements were restricted to alkaline solutions because of the limited solubility of this protein at more neutral pH values. A very high frictional ratio for the protein suggests an asymmetric structure. However, there are elements of organized structure since typical thermal transition curves were found by several methods. Consequently, a model in which ordered domains are connected by flexible polypeptide chains seems to account for all the hydrodynamic and optical data."

https://openalex.org/W1604129087,"Abstract About 1,300-fold purification of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase has been achieved from the extract of bovine thymus with a recovery of 10 to 20%. The final preparation has a purity of 99%, and the enzyme is composed of a single peptide with a molecular weight of 130,000. The purified enzyme required NAD+, Mg2+, a thiol compound, and histones for full activity. Whereas DNA is essential for activation of the enzyme, histones are not. The observed stimulation of the reaction by histones is shown to be due to masking of the inhibitory effect of contaminating denartured DNA in native DNA preparation. The concentration of DNA required for half-maximal enzyme activity (apparent Km for DNA) is proportional to the concentration of enzyme in the reaction mixture. The minimum estimation of the number of nucleotide pairs of DNA required for half-maximal activation of one enzyme molecule is 220 to 240 for bulk of calf thymus while the value is 10 for a calf thymus DNA fraction, active DNA, which was separated from the enzyme fraction in a stage of the purification. These results suggest that the enzyme is activated by binding to a specific site on calf thymus DNA. The apparent Km for NAD+ and the maximum velocity of the enzyme are estimated to be 60 micrometer and 0.91 mumolper min per mg, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2112286822,"Incubation of cultured mouse neuroblastoma cells with histamine caused a rapid and marked increase in the formation of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) by these cells. Receptor agonists for H1, but not H2, caused this effect which was reduced by H1 but not by H2 or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists. These results indicate that activation of H1 receptors in these cultured nerve cells stimulated cyclic GMP formation."
https://openalex.org/W2162524777,"The activity of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase has been shown to be high in both mesenteric arteries and veins; the present study suggests that it may be responsible for the inactivation of prostacyclin (PGI2). The cytoplasmic fractions of bovine mesenteric arteries and veins were incubated with radiolabeled PGI2 in the presence of NAD+ or NADP+. The substrate was rapidly converted to a product, which was isolated and identified as 6,15-diketo prostaglandin F1alpha, (6,15-diketo-PGF1alpha) by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The initial reaction rate began to level off after less than 1 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. When radiolabeled 6-keto-PGF1alpha, the stable hydrolysis product of PGI2, was used as substrate under the same conditions, 97% was recovered unmetabolized after 2 min of incubation. Catabolism of PGI2 may be a major determinant of its levels in blood vessels and, therefore, may be of crucial importance to regulating the action of PGI2. Further, estimation of PGI2 generation by either tissues or organs may be misleading if only 6-keto-PGF1alpha is measured."
https://openalex.org/W2033015422,"In squid axon, internal alkalinization from pH 7.1 to pH 10.2 results in a reversible decrease of the maximum inward current and the steady state sodium channel inactivation. Similar effects were observed after treatment of the axon with tetranitromethane or after iodination with lactoperoxidase. These results suggest that a tyrosine residue is an essential component of the inactivation process in this nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2091715064,"Kainic acid lesion of cell bodies in the dorsal striatum enhanced the stereotypy-producing effects of d-amphetamine without affecting the sterotypy produced by the direct receptor agonist apomorphine. This pattern of results parallels that found in patients suffering from Hungtington's chorea, thus strengthening the parallels between the kainic acid animal model and the human disease state initially suggested on biochemical gounds. The present results further suggest a dissociation of the mechanisms involved in the production of stereotypy by these two drugs, perhaps in terms of differential involvement of the striato-nigral negative feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W1500346713,Transglutaminases were found to catalyze the formation of cross-links between peptide chains by means of a transfer reaction between the carboxamide group of a glutamine residue in each chain and both primary amino groups of a diamine or a polyamine. Production of this heretofore undescribed linkage by guinea pig liver transglutaminase was demonstrated by the use of high performance liquid chromatography in a model system using glutamine peptide derivatives and a variety of diamines and polyamines. Evidence for intermolecular cross-linking through polyamines with both the liver enzyme and thrombin-activated human plasma blood coagulation factor XIII was obtained by the use of a guanidinated derivative of beta-casein.

https://openalex.org/W1504552010,"Abstract In certain lines of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells, glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) specific activity is increased 2.5- to 3-fold by the addition of glucocorticoids to the growth media. Actinomycin D blocks both the induction and deinduction of glutamine synthetase by glucocorticoids, suggesting a requirement of RNA synthesis for both processes. Using an antiserum raised against purified rat liver glutamine synthetase, we have precipitated radiolabeled glutamine synthetase from HTC cells. Electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates on sodium didecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels isolates the subunit of glutamine synthetase and permits the radioactivity in the glutamine synthetase band to be quantitated. Using this technique, we have investigated the effect of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, on the rates of synthesis and degradation of glutamine synthetase. Dexamethasone (10(-7) M) increases the rate of synthesis of glutamine synthetase 2- to 3-fold but has no effect on the rate of glutamine synthetase degradation. The rates of total cell protein synthesis and degradation are not significantly affected by dexamethasone. The presence of actinomycin D at the time of removal of dexamethasone from induced cells prevents the fall in the induced rate of synthesis of glutamine synthetase normally seen when the inhibitor is removed from the culture medium. The regulation of glutamine synthetase by dexamethasone has been compared to the regulation of another dexamethasone-inducible enzyme in HTC cells, tyrosine aminotransferase, and been found to be similar in all parameters studied."

https://openalex.org/W1529649641,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat liver homogenates was activated in vitro in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in rat liver preparations was determined in a 1-min assay to preclude the possibility of citrate activation of the enzyme during the assay period. Activation of the enzyme occurred more rapidly in liver preparations continuously maintained at ambient or greater temperatures than in homogenates of liver which had been chilled. High speed supernatant (105,000 X g, 60 min) did not heat-activate, and reconstitution of the heat-activatable 27,000 X g, 20-min, fraction by recombining the high speed pellet with the high speed supernatant only partially restored the heat activatability. Elution of the 105,000 X g supernatant from Sephadex G-25 resulted in an enzyme preparation which was heat-activatable. Addition of boiled 105,000 X g supernatant to the Sephadex G-25-treated enzyme again prevented heat activation. Dilution of the enzyme 5-fold did not prevent heat activation."
https://openalex.org/W1561777058,"When chick liver cells in monolayer culture were incubated with 32Pi in the presence of insulin, acetyl-CoA carboxylase became extensively labeled with 32Pi reaching a stoichiometry of 9 to 10 mol of phosphoryl group per mol of 240,000-dalton enzyme subunit. The covalently bound phosphate was found to be metabolically labile, turning over with a t1/2 of approximately 2 h (enzyme t1/2 approximately equal to 24 h). Addition of Bt2cAMP altered neither the rate nor extent of phosphorylation. Contrary to other reports, the fully phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase appears to be catalytically active."

https://openalex.org/W1580000340,"The purpose of this investigation was to compare the Ca2+ binding properties of troponin from cardiac and skeletal muscles since significant differences have been reported in the amino acid sequences of the respective calcium binding subunits. Measurements of Ca”+ binding were made by equilibrium dialysis with metal ion buffers to control the free Ca2+ concentration or by gel filtration in the absence of metal ion buffers. Capacities of 2 and 4 mol of Ca2+ were found/m01 of cardiac and skeletal muscle troponin, respectively. In the presence of MgC12 a single class of binding sites was found for both proteins with an association constant of 3 X lo6 M-‘. In the absence of MgClz, the association constant for cardiac troponin was increased to 4 X lo7 Mm’ with a total capacity of 2 mol of Ca”+. In the absence of MgCl2 a similar increase in the association constant for only two of the binding sites was noted in skeletal muscle troponin, as previously reported (Potter, J. D., and Gergely, J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4628-4633). Assuming competition between Ca2+ and M&+ for the two cation binding sites in cardiac troponin, the binding constant for Mg”+ was 1.6 x lo3 M-‘. A decrease in pH from 7.0 to 6.2 did not alter the capacity or affinity of cardiac or skeletal muscle troponin for Ca2+. Thus, cardiac troponin contains two Ca2+ binding sites which are similar to the two high affinity Ca2+ binding sites of skeletal muscle troponin which also bind M&’ competitively (Ca2+-M$+ sites). Furthermore, a decrease in pH to values which approximate those seen in intracellular acidosis does not lead to a derangement of the Ca2+ binding properties of troponin."

The value of kcat/Km was observed to be modulated by two acid ionizations rather than a single ionization as previously believed. For the five substrates studied, the average pK values for the two ionizations are 3.78 +/- 0.2 and 3.95 +/- 0.1 at T/2 0.3, 25 degrees C. The observation that similar pK values were obtained with different substrates was taken as evidence that the kinetically determined pK values are close in value to true macroscopic ionization constants for ionization of groups on the free enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1607875760,"The induction of growth hormone synthesis and mRNA by thyroid hormone in cultured GH1 cells is mediated by the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor. In addition, the regulation of the growth hormone response by glucocorticoid is highly dependent on the action of thyroid hormone. To clarify whether thyroid hormone has a general influence on glucocorticoid action in GH1 cells, the glucocorticoid induction of growth hormone and glutamine synthetase was simultaneously examined. In contrast to the growth hormone response, the induction of glutamine synthetase by glucocorticoid was not influenced by thyroid hormone. Both responses appear to be modulated by the glucocorticoid receptor, and thyroid hormone had no influence on nuclear-associated glucocorticoid receptor levels. These results suggest that the thyroid hormone control of glucocorticoid induction of growth hormone may be a selective process, and the nuclear associated receptors for both thyroid and glucocorticoid hormones interrelate to control the growth hormone response."

It was seen in nuclei of Vero and Aedes albopictus cells, but not in BHK cells, KB cells, chick embryo fibroblasts, or HeLa cells. Reactive dsRNA was present in the nucleoplasm, but not in nucleoli or cytoplasm. Extracted RNA from the whole cell contained from 0.08 percent (BHK) to 0.46 percent (HeLa) dsRNA, as estimated by serological methods. This dsRNA, found in molecules having the size distribution of heterogeneous nuclear RNA, did not renature rapidly after denaturation. The quantity of dsRNA in total extracted RNA did not correlate with the presence or absence of nuclear staining in situ."

https://openalex.org/W1532835721,"The conformation of the outer surface of the human red cell membrane has been studied under various conditions using the impermeant probe [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid. At least seven polypeptides were labeled by the reagent, including the three extractable glycoproteins separable by the electrophoretic method employed. The Mr = 43,000 protein band was shown to contain two labeled species, one a glycoprotein, in addition to its major constituent, red cell actin. The extent and pattern of labeling were very sensitive to changes in pH and temperature. Total labeling increased with increasing pH and was greater at 4 degrees C than 37 degrees C. Binding of the probe to the Mr = 90,000 polypeptide and the major glycoprotein were relatively increased with increasing pH and temperature while opposite effects were observed for the Mr = 43,000 peptide(s). The pH effects on external membrane labeling were rapidly reversible. Results were similar in cells of different densities, suggesting that the pH and temperature effects were not related to cell age. The data presented emphasize the lability of membrane conformation and reactivity and thus the necessity to consider carefully the conditions of labeling in interpretation of studies using impermeant probes."
https://openalex.org/W1563054886,"The effect of solvent conditions on the conformation of rabbit Clq was studied by both spectroscopic and nonspectroscopic methods. The conformation of Clq in buffered saline solutions at pH 7.4 or 6.0 did not differ significantly from Clq at twice the saline concentration as determined with circular dichroism, difference spectroscopy, and tritium-hydrogen exchange techniques. Addition of calcium to the buffers had no structural effects in any of the conditions examined. Hydrogen exchange experiments performed at pH 7.4 were also unaffected by magnesium, manganese, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. With all the methods used a pH effect was observable between 5.1 and 8.3. From solvent perturbation difference spectroscopy results it was calculated that the equivalent of 10 +/- 2 and 6 +/- 1 mol of tyrosine and tryptophan/mol of Clq, respectively, became exposed at the lower pH. A small positive CD band in the 231 to 235 nm region decreased in wavelength and increased in magnitude as a function of decreasing pH, indicating tyrosine exposure at the lower pH and possibly changes in the collagen-like structure of Clq. Hydrogen exchange experiments indicate a small, but significant, conformation transition occurring in the pH 5 region and a stabilization of conformation between pH 6 to 8. From these results the conformational pH dependence was interpreted as an acid expansion of Clq with a minor conformational transition occurring between pH 5 AND 6. These effects may in part be associated with decreased Clq-Ig interactions which have been observed at the lower pH."
https://openalex.org/W1557302821,"Leghemoglobin(IV), the derivative of leghemoglobin at the formal oxidation state IV, when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature exhibits radically different spectra at acid and alkaline pH. The acid and alkaline forms are freely interconvertible. The optical spectrum of the acid form is closely similar to optical spectra of the red higher oxidation states of horseradish and cytochrome c peroxidases, showing that the configuration of the heme iron is the same throughout this family of compounds. That configuration is believed to be Fe(IV) in a porphyrin environment. The optical spectrum of the alkaline form of leghemoglobin(IV) recalls that of alkaline low spin ferric leghemoglobin. Near infrared spectra of leghemoglobin(IV), myoglobin(IV), and the higher oxidation states of the peroxidases are featureless to 1300 nm, suggesting a common structural feature. The acid form of leghemoglobin(IV), seen in fluid buffer as a transient species at pH 5 or less, is conveniently generated by cooling a solution of the more stable alkaline form in borate buffer to liquid nitrogen temperature. At this temperature borate buffers become acid."
