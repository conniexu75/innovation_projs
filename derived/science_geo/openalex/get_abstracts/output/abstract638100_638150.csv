Y. Wang et al. show that strong bonds are formed between lead and both chlorine and oxygen atoms in a film with a lead-rich surface and a chlorinated graphene oxide layer. This interface was used with common hole-transporting materials to fabricate solar cells that maintained 90% of their initial efficiency of 21% after operation at 60°C for 1000 hours.

We generated cyclo[18]carbon (C18) using atom manipulation on bilayer NaCl on Cu(111) at 5 Kelvin by eliminating carbon monoxide from a cyclocarbon oxide molecule C24O6. Characterization of cyclo[18]carbon by high-resolution atomic force microscopy revealed a polyynic structure with defined positions of alternating triple and single bonds. The high reactivity of cyclocarbon and cyclocarbon oxides allows covalent coupling between molecules to be induced by atom manipulation, opening an avenue for the synthesis of other carbon allotropes and carbon-rich materials from the coalescence of cyclocarbon molecules."

An applied magnetic field can easily “break” such pairs—and destroy superconductivity—by aligning both spins in the same direction. In contrast, spin-triplet superconductors are much more resilient to magnetic fields. Very few candidates for such materials have been discovered. Ran et al. add to this select group by observing signatures of spin-triplet superconductivity, including a very large and anisotropic upper critical magnetic field, in the material UTe 2 . Because spin-triplet superconductors may naturally exhibit topological superconductivity, this material may also be of interest in quantum computing. Science , this issue p. 684"

Kim et al. developed a soft, fully portable, lightweight exosuit that is able to reduce the metabolic rate for both running and walking by assisting each motion via the hip extension (see the Perspective by Pons). A waist belt holds most of the mass, thus reducing the cost of carrying the suit. By tracking the motion of the user, the suit is able to switch modes between the two types of motion automatically.

Tian et al. identified a gene in teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, and used it to alter maize such that the plant has a narrower architecture that nonetheless allows leaves access to sunlight (see the Perspective by Hake and Richardson). The yield advantage only becomes evident with the high-density plantings characteristic of modern agriculture, perhaps explaining why this gene was not brought into the fold during the previous millennia of maize domestication.

https://openalex.org/W2968074903,"An essential prerequisite for the survival of an organism is the ability to detect and respond to aversive stimuli. Current belief is that noxious stimuli directly activate nociceptive sensory nerve endings in the skin. We discovered a specialized cutaneous glial cell type with extensive processes forming a mesh-like network in the subepidermal border of the skin that conveys noxious thermal and mechanical sensitivity. We demonstrate a direct excitatory functional connection to sensory neurons and provide evidence of a previously unknown organ that has an essential physiological role in sensing noxious stimuli. Thus, these glial cells, which are intimately associated with unmyelinated nociceptive nerves, are inherently mechanosensitive and transmit nociceptive information to the nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2967212061,"Active migration renews gut epithelia Epithelial tissues are continuously renewed throughout adult life, and the gut epithelium is the fastest self-renewing tissue in mammals. Over 3 days or so, epithelial cells migrate from the crypts, where they are born, to the tips of the villi, where they die. It is commonly believed that migration is strictly passive, driven by mitotic pressure in crypts—as cells divide, they push their neighbors upward. Krndija et al. now challenge this concept and show that cells migrate actively, using actin-rich basal protrusions oriented in the direction of migration (see the Perspective by Jansen).

Enzymes known as flippases and floppases use the energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to translocate lipids against a concentration gradient from the outer to inner or inner to outer leaflets, respectively. Flippases are P4-type ATPases that are important in processes such as membrane trafficking, signaling, and apoptosis. Hiraizumi et al. report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of six intermediates of the human flippase ATP8A1 bound to the partner protein it requires for function, CDC50. ATP binding and autophosphorylation of ATP8A1 drive a cycle of conformations in which lipids bind differently, powering translocation. Science , this issue p. 1149"

Norman et al. investigated epilepsy patients who had electrodes implanted in the hippocampus and a variety of cortical areas. Using a visual learning paradigm, they examined the temporal relationship between the incidence of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and recall. Effective encoding of visual information was associated with higher incidence of ripples. Successful recall was preceded by an increased probability of ripples, which were also associated with transient reemergence of activation patterns in higher visual cortical areas. Hippocampal ripples may thus boost recollections during episodic memory retrieval. Science , this issue p. eaax1030"

https://openalex.org/W2968250169,"Hospitals under financial pressure may struggle to maintain quality and patient safety and have worse patient outcomes relative to well-resourced hospitals. Poor predictive validity may explain why previous studies on the association between finances and quality/safety have been equivocal. This manuscript employs principal component analysis to produce robust measures of both financial status and quality/safety of care, to assess our a priori hypothesis: hospital financial performance is associated with the provision of quality care, as measured by quality and safety processes, patient outcomes, and patient centered care.This 2014 cross-sectional study investigated hospital financial condition and hospital quality and safety at acute care hospitals. The hospital financial data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) cost report were used to develop a composite financial performance score using principal component analysis. Hospital quality and patient safety were measured with a composite quality/safety performance score derived from principal component analysis, utilizing a range of established quality and safety indicators including: risk-standardized inpatient mortality, 30-day mortality, 30-day readmissions for select conditions, patient safety indicators from inpatient admissions, process of care chart reviews, CMS value-based purchasing total performance score and patient experience of care surveys. The correlation between the composite financial performance score and the composite quality/safety performance score was calculated using linear regression adjusting for hospital characteristics.Among the 108 New York State acute care facilities for which data were available, there is a clear relationship between hospital financial performance and hospital quality/safety performance score (standardized correlation coefficient 0.34, p<0.001). The composite financial performance score is also positively associated with the CMS Value Based Purchasing Total Performance Score (standardized correlation coefficient 0.277, p = 0.002); while it is negatively associated with 30 day readmission for all outcomes (standardized correlation coefficient -0.236, p = 0.013), 30-day readmission for congestive heart failure (standardized correlation coefficient -0.23, p = 0.018), 30 day readmission for pneumonia (standardized correlation coefficient -0.209, p = 0.033), and a decrease in 30-day mortality for acute myocardial infarction (standardized correlation coefficient -0.211, p = 0.027). Used alone, operating margin and total margin are poor predictors of quality and safety outcomes.Strong financial performance is associated with improved patient reported experience of care, the strongest component distinguishing quality and safety. These findings suggest that financially stable hospitals are better able to maintain highly reliable systems and provide ongoing resources for quality improvement."

https://openalex.org/W2969073171,"Evasion of the host immune responses is critical for both persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and associated cancer progression. We have previously shown that expression of the homeostatic chemokine CXCL14 is significantly downregulated by the HPV oncoprotein E7 during cancer progression. Restoration of CXCL14 expression in HPV-positive head and neck cancer (HNC) cells dramatically suppresses tumor growth and increases survival through an immune-dependent mechanism in mice. Although CXCL14 recruits natural killer (NK) and T cells to the tumor microenvironment, the mechanism by which CXCL14 mediates tumor suppression through NK and/or T cells remained undefined. Here we report that CD8+ T cells are required for CXCL14-mediated tumor suppression. Using a CD8+ T-cell receptor transgenic model, we show that the CXCL14-mediated antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses require antigen specificity. Interestingly, CXCL14 expression restores major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression on HPV-positive HNC cells downregulated by HPV, and knockdown of MHC-I expression in HNC cells results in loss of tumor suppression even with CXCL14 expression. These results suggest that CXCL14 enacts antitumor immunity through restoration of MHC-I expression on tumor cells and promoting antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to suppress HPV-positive HNC."

Galactosaminogalactan (GAG) is an integral component of the A. fumigatus biofilm matrix and a key virulence factor. GAG is a heterogeneous linear α-1,4–linked exopolysaccharide of galactose and GalNAc that is partially deacetylated after secretion. A cluster of five co-expressed genes has been linked to GAG biosynthesis and modification. One gene in this cluster, ega3, is annotated as encoding a putative α-1,4-galactosaminidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 114 (GH114). Herein, we show that recombinant Ega3 is an active glycoside hydrolase that disrupts GAG-dependent A. fumigatus and Pel polysaccharide-dependent Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms at nanomolar concentrations. Using MS and functional assays, we demonstrate that Ega3 is an endo-acting α-1,4-galactosaminidase whose activity depends on the conserved acidic residues, Asp-189 and Glu-247. X-ray crystallographic structural analysis of the apo Ega3 and an Ega3-galactosamine complex, at 1.76 and 2.09 Å resolutions, revealed a modified (β/α)8-fold with a deep electronegative cleft, which upon ligand binding is capped to form a tunnel. Our structural analysis coupled with in silico docking studies also uncovered the molecular determinants for galactosamine specificity and substrate binding at the −2 to +1 binding subsites.

https://openalex.org/W2967490285,"Toxoplasma gondii is an important neurotropic pathogen that establishes latent infections in humans that can cause toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals. It replicates inside host cells and has developed several strategies to manipulate host immune responses. However, the cytoplasmic pathogen-sensing pathway that detects T. gondii is not well-characterized. Here, we found that cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a sensor of foreign dsDNA, is required for activation of anti-T. gondii immune signaling in a mouse model. We also found that mice deficient in STING (Stinggt/gt mice) are much more susceptible to T. gondii infection than WT mice. Of note, the induction of inflammatory cytokines, type I IFNs, and interferon-stimulated genes in the spleen from Stinggt/gt mice was significantly impaired. Stinggt/gt mice exhibited more severe symptoms than cGAS-deficient mice after T. gondii infection. Interestingly, we found that the dense granule protein GRA15 from T. gondii is secreted into the host cell cytoplasm and then localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, mediated by the second transmembrane motif in GRA15, which is essential for activating STING and innate immune responses. Mechanistically, GRA15 promoted STING polyubiquitination at Lys-337 and STING oligomerization in a TRAF protein-dependent manner. Accordingly, GRA15-deficient T. gondii failed to elicit robust innate immune responses compared with WT T. gondii. Consequently, GRA15−/− T. gondii was more virulent and caused higher mortality of WT mice but not Stinggt/gt mice upon infection. Together, T. gondii infection triggers cGAS/STING signaling, which is enhanced by GRA15 in a STING- and TRAF-dependent manner.

As for humans, nearly 30% of the world's population is infected with T. gondii (3Montoya J.G. Liesenfeld O.

In healthy adults, T. gondii is controlled by the immune system and remains dormant in the brain. However, in immunocompromised individuals, a defect of the immune system leads to the reactivation of the T. gondii parasites and the development of toxoplasmosis. Reactivated parasite replication causes life-threatening brain damage with brain abscesses and necrotic areas (4Yarovinsky F. Innate immunity to Toxoplasma gondii infection.Nat. Rev.

Previous studies showed that TLR11 is the PRR of T. gondii in murine cells. TLR11 is able to detect the actin-binding protein Profilin, which is required for entry of T. gondii during infection. TLR11 and TLR12 form a heterodimer in murine dendritic cells (DC) after sensing Profilin and activate adaptor protein MyD88 to initiate downstream signaling for defense against T. gondii (5Koblansky A.A.

Moreover, TLR7 and TLR9 are able to compensate for the loss of TLR11 by activating MyD88 in TLR11-deficient mice (6Andrade W.A. Souza Mdo C. Ramos-Martinez E. Nagpal K. Dutra M.S. Melo M.B.

In addition, TLR7 expression is undetectable in CD9α + DCs, which is believed to be the primary DC subset for surveillance of the infection of T. gondii (8Edwards A.D. Diebold S.S. Slack E.M.

The canonical type I, II, or III strains failed to trigger type I IFN induction (23Melo M.B. Nguyen Q.P. Cordeiro C. Hassan M.A. Yang N. McKell R. Rosowski E.E. Julien L. Butty V. Dardé M.L.

STING is a key signal molecule localized in ER. Activated STING recruits kinase TBK1 that phosphorylates IRF3/IRF7 to initiate transcription of type I IFNs. It is believed that post-translational modification of STING modulates its activity and protein stability. TBK1 phosphorylates STING at serine 366, which is critical for IRF3 recruitment and type I IFN induction (27Liu S. Cai X. Wu J. Cong Q. Chen X. Li T. Du F. Ren J. Wu Y.T. Grishin N.V. Chen Z.J.

E3 ligase TRIM56 is able to attach Lys-63–linked polyubiquitin chain to STING and promotes dimerization and activation of STING (28Tsuchida T. Zou J. Saitoh T. Kumar H. Abe T. Matsuura Y. Kawai T.

However, the role of cGAS/STING in the host defense against T. gondii has not been well-characterized. Accumulating studies have shown that T. gondii virulence is mediated by effector proteins secreted by parasites into the host cell. Dense granule proteins (GRAs) are produced by T. gondii, many of which are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and contribute to the maturation and structural integrity of the PV (32Rommereim L.M. Bellini V. Fox B.A. Pètre G. Rak C. Touquet B. Aldebert D. Dubremetz J.F. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Mercier C. Bzik D.J. Phenotypes associated with knockouts of eight dense granule gene loci (GRA2-9) in virulent Toxoplasma gondii.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27458822): e015930610.1371/journal.pone.0159306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GRA proteins also participate in the modulation of host defense during infection (33Hiszczyńska-Sawicka E. Olędzka G. Holec-Gąsior L. Li H. Xu J.B. Sedcole R. Kur J. Bickerstaffe R. Stankiewicz M.

GRA proteins mainly suppress host immune responses and facilitate parasite replication (35Hunter C.A. Sibley L.D. Modulation of innate immunity by Toxoplasma gondii virulence effectors.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10 (23070557): 766-77810.1038/nrmicro2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, GRA15 activates NF-κB signaling in a TRAF6-dependent way, and in turn it up-regulates the production of IL12 (36Rosowski E.E. Lu D. Julien L. Rodda L. Gaiser R.A. Jensen K.D. Saeij J.P. Strain-specific activation of the NF-κB pathway by GRA15, a novel Toxoplasma gondii dense granule protein.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 (21199955): 195-21210.1084/jem.20100717Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Moreover, GRA15 promotes the secretion of IL1β via inflammatory monocytes during infection (37Gov L. Karimzadeh A. Ueno N. Lodoen M.B. Human innate immunity to Toxoplasma gondii is mediated by host caspase-1 and ASC and parasite GRA15.MBio. 2013; 4 (23839215): e00213-e0025510.1128/mBio.00255-13Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that cGAS is required for innate immune response against T. gondii. cGAS-deficient mice are much more susceptible to lethal infection of T. gondii than WT mice. Loss of STING results in a more severe phenotype during T. gondii infection. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that secreted dense granule protein GRA15 promotes oligomerization and activation of STING. GRA15 promotes polyubiquitination of STING at lysine 337 via TRAF proteins, which is required for activation of STING. Together, GRA15 enhances cGAS/STING signaling by potentiating STING activity during T. gondii infection. The cGAS/STING axis recognizes cytoplasmic DNA and triggers innate immune responses. Here, we investigated the role of STING in host defense against the infection of T. gondii. The STING loss–of–function Tmem173gt/gt mice (also known as Golden ticket and here referred to Stinggt/gt) (38Sauer J.D. Sotelo-Troha K. von Moltke J. Monroe K.M. Rae C.S. Brubaker S.W. Hyodo M. Hayakawa Y. Woodward J.J. Portnoy D.A. Vance R.E. The N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea–induced Goldenticket mouse mutant reveals an essential function of Sting in the in vivo interferon response to Listeria monocytogenes and cyclic dinucleotides.Infect. Immun. 2011; 79 (21098106): 688-69410.1128/IAI.00999-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and WT mice were infected with type II T. gondii (ME49 strain). Interestingly, Stinggt/gt mice were more susceptible to T. gondii infection than WT animals (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the survival results, the parasite burden (as assessed by T. gondii B1 DNA) was significantly higher in the spleen of Stinggt/gt mice than WT mice after T. gondii infection (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we detected less type I IFNs, including IFNβ and IFNa4 in the spleen of Stinggt/gt mice than WT mice during infection (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A). Consequently, induction of interferon-stimulated genes, including ISG15 and CXCL10, was significantly impaired in STING mutant mice. In addition to type I IFNs, STING is also required for the induction of inflammatory cytokine interleukin 12 (IL12), which is believed critical for controlling T. gondii infection (Fig. 1C). Consistently, the induction of IFNγ is modestly decreased in Stinggt/gt mice (Fig. 1C). Therefore, STING is required for host defense against infection with T. gondii in vivo. At the cellular level, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from WT and Stinggt/gt mice and infected these cells with T. gondii. In line with the animal experiments, macrophages with mutant STING failed to mount production of IFNβ, ISG15, CXCL10, and IL12 during T. gondii infection (Fig. 1D). To further confirm these findings, we infected immortalized Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (iBMDM) with T. gondii after deleting endogenous STING by using CRISPR/Cas9. The lacking of STING resulted in more parasite replication in iBMDM, which was measured by immunofluorescence and T. gondii B1 DNA qRT-PCR (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1B). The induction of ISGs and IL12 was also significantly decreased in STING-deficient iBMDM, although the induction of these cytokines in WT iBMDM was not as robust as that in WT primary peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, we did not observe the induction of IFNβ by T. gondii infection in this cell type (Fig. S1C). This could be due to the specificity of cell type–dependent pathways or immune evasion strategies utilized by T. gondii. As cGAS is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor that functions upstream of STING (39Sun L. Wu J. Du F. Chen X. Chen Z.J. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates the type I interferon pathway.Science. 2013; 339 (23258413): 786-79110.1126/science.1232458Crossref PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar), we reasoned that cGAS might also be involved in anti-T. gondii responses by sensing the cytoplasmic DNA. We then evaluated the involvement of cGAS in anti-T. gondii immune responses. The mouse survival experiment showed that cGAS was required for anti-T. gondii responses (Fig. 1G). In addition to DNA, RNA from the invading pathogen can also trigger innate immunity of the host. RLRs recognize foreign RNA in the cytoplasm and activate adaptor protein MAVS. To this end, we infected MAVS-deficient mice, whose cytoplasmic RNA-sensing pathway was blocked, or WT mice with T. gondii. The survival and body weight results showed that MAVS was dispensable for anti-T. gondii immune responses (Fig. S1D). Together, cGAS and STING are crucial for innate immunity against T. gondii. During T. gondii infection in cGAS-deficient mice, interestingly, we noticed that loss of cGAS resulted in less severe symptoms and delayed death than STING deficiency, indicating an additional mechanism contributing to STING-mediated defense exists. We next focused on revealing this additional mechanism by which T. gondii activates STING signaling. In addition to nucleic acids, proteins from pathogens are also able to regulate host immune responses (35Hunter C.A. Sibley L.D. Modulation of innate immunity by Toxoplasma gondii virulence effectors.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10 (23070557): 766-77810.1038/nrmicro2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 40Melo M.B.

It is believed that the effector proteins secreted by T. gondii are able to modulate host immune responses (41Hakimi M.A. Bougdour A. Toxoplasma's ways of manipulating the host transcriptome via secreted effectors.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2015; 26 (25912924): 24-3110.1016/j.mib.2015.04.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Dense granule proteins (GRAs) have emerged as important determinants of T. gondii pathogenesis. To determine whether the T. gondii proteins affect innate immune activation, we constructed plasmids encoding various dense granule proteins of T. gondii and transfected these plasmids together with cGAS, STING, and IFNβ luciferase reporter plasmids. We found that only GRA15, which was reported to regulate NF-κB activation (36Rosowski E.E. Lu D. Julien L. Rodda L. Gaiser R.A. Jensen K.D. Saeij J.P. Strain-specific activation of the NF-κB pathway by GRA15, a novel Toxoplasma gondii dense granule protein.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 (21199955): 195-21210.1084/jem.20100717Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), was able to significantly enhance cGAS/STING-mediated induction of IFNβ (Fig. 2A). We then investigated the effect of GRA15 on parasite virulence. We generated GRA15-deficient T. gondii by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the previous finding (36Rosowski E.E. Lu D. Julien L. Rodda L. Gaiser R.A. Jensen K.D. Saeij J.P. Strain-specific activation of the NF-κB pathway by GRA15, a novel Toxoplasma gondii dense granule protein.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 (21199955): 195-21210.1084/jem.20100717Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible to GRA15−/− T. gondii than WT T. gondii (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the survival data, mice infected with GRA15−/− T. gondii showed significantly higher parasite burden in the spleen than mice infected with WT T. gondii (Fig. 2D). Moreover, replication of GRA15−/− T. gondii significantly increased in MEFs compared with WT parasites (Fig. S2A). Furthermore, GRA15−/− T. gondii induced less IFNβ, ISG15, CXCL10, IFNγ, and IL12 than WT T. gondii did in the spleen (Fig. 2E), although the decrease of IFNβ induction was not as significant as other cytokines. Consequently, GRA15−/− parasite infection caused more severe mortality of mice. These results suggested that GRA15 is required for competent induction of innate immune responses. To further confirm this, we infected iBMDM with WT or GRA15−/− T. gondii. qRT-PCR assay showed that the production of cytokines was severely impaired during GRA15−/− T. gondii infection compared with WT parasite infection (Fig. 2F). To examine whether GRA15 is involved in STING signaling in vivo, we infected Stinggt/gt mice with WT or GRA15−/− parasite. Th"

However, little is known about the prevalence and risk factors for these conditions among out-of-school AGYW. This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated factors in a community sample of out-of-school AGYW in Tanzania.A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from an on-going cluster randomized controlled trial in North-West Tanzania was conducted. A total of 3013 out-of-school AGYW aged 15 to 23 years from 30 clusters were included. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a tool comprising of PHQ-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-2) screeners. Data were collected using Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI). A random-effects logistic regression was fitted for binary outcomes and an ordinal logistic regression model with robust variance was used to adjust for clustering at the village level. Logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression were used to explore the associations between mental disorders symptoms and other factors.The prevalence of depressive (PHQ-2 ≥ 3) and anxiety (GAD-2 ≥ 3) symptoms among out-of-school AGYW were 36% (95% CI 33.8%-37.3%) and 31% (95% CI 29.0%-32.3%) respectively. Further, using the PHQ-4 tool, 33% (95% CI 30.8%-34.2%) had mild, 20% (95% CI 18.3%-21.1%) moderate and 6% (95% CI 5.5%-7.2%) had severe symptoms of anxiety and depression. After adjusting for other covariates, two factors most strongly associated with having anxiety symptoms were violence experience from sexual partners (AOR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.36-1.96) and HIV positive status (AOR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.03-2.31). Likewise, living alone, with younger siblings or others (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI: 1.47-4.29) and violence experience from sexual partners (AOR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.59-2.27) were strongly associated with depression symptoms. Having savings (AOR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and emotional support (AOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.67-0.99) were protective against depression and anxiety, respectively.Depressive and anxiety symptoms are prevalent among out-of-school AGYW in Tanzania. The findings emphasize the need to strengthen preventive interventions and scale-up mental health disorder screening, referral for diagnosis and management."

Therefore, we assessed age-appropriate vaccinations coverage and its associated factors among children 12 to 23 months of age in Menz Lalo district, northeast Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Menz Lalo district from March to April/2018 among 417 mothers/caregivers with children 12 to 23 months of age using simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Information about children’s vaccination status was collected from vaccination cards. Age-appropriate vaccination coverage was measured using World Health Organization vaccination schedule recommendation. Data was entered into Epi-Info7 software and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Four consecutive logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with age-inappropriate vaccinations. A P-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to state statistically significant associations. Results Age-appropriate vaccination coverage was 39.1% (95% CI: 34.3 to 44) for pentavalent 1, 36.3% (95% CI: 31.6 to 41.5) for pentavalent 2, 30.3% (95% CI: 25.6 to 35) for pentavalent 3 and 26.4% (95% CI: 21.7 to 31) for measles vaccine doses. Age-inappropriate pentavalent 1–3 vaccinations was associated with being male sex (AOR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.29–0.74), lack of telephone (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4–3.6), lack of usual caretaker (AOR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.3–5.2), unplanned pregnancy (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1–3.5), missing pregnant women’s conference (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3–5.7), decreasing birth order (AOR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17–0.68) and insufficient knowledge (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.6–4.4). Conclusion The proportions of age-appropriate vaccination coverage were low in the study area. Modifiable factors were associated with age-inappropriate vaccinations. Vaccination interventions should consider identified modifiable factors to improve age-appropriate vaccinations coverage."

https://openalex.org/W2969124740,"Isotope compositions of basalts provide information about the chemical reservoirs in Earth's interior and play a critical role in defining models of Earth's structure. However, the helium isotope signature of the mantle below depths of a few hundred kilometers has been difficult to measure directly. This information is a vital baseline for understanding helium isotopes in erupted basalts. We measured He-Sr-Pb isotope ratios in superdeep diamond fluid inclusions from the transition zone (depth of 410 to 660 kilometers) unaffected by degassing and shallow crustal contamination. We found extreme He-C-Pb-Sr isotope variability, with high 3He/4He ratios related to higher helium concentrations. This indicates that a less degassed, high-3He/4He deep mantle source infiltrates the transition zone, where it interacts with recycled material, creating the diverse compositions recorded in ocean island basalts."
https://openalex.org/W2967222145,"Arapaima, pirarucu or paiche (Arapaima gigas) is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, and has a long history of commercial exploitation in the Amazon region. To estimate levels of genetic variability and historical and recent connectivity in Arapaima, we examined variation in eleven microsatellite DNA markers in individuals from 22 localities in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The results of analysis of molecular variance, Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis of principal components showed that Arapaima in our samples represents two major populations, one in the Amazonas and one in the Araguaia-Tocantins River basins. The Amazonas population is further structured by isolation-by-distance with the hydrologically largely unconnected Amapá locality representing the eastern-most extreme of this continuum; gene flow predominates at distances of less than 1500 km with localities separated by over 2000 km dominated by genetic drift and effectively forming different populations. We saw no evidence of multiple species of Arapaima in the Amazonas basin, and analysis of pairwise genetic divergence (FST) with Mantel tests and correlograms indicated that this largest population exhibits a large-scale pattern of isolation-by-distance, with which results from MIGRATE-N agreed. The degree and significance of genetic divergence indicates that most sampled localities represent demographically independent sub-populations, although we did identify several recent migration events between both proximal and more distant localities. The levels of genetic diversity were heterogeneous across sites, including low genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and evidence of genetic bottlenecks in several places. On average the levels of gene diversity and rarefied allelic richness were higher for localities along the Amazonas mainstem than in the tributaries, despite these being the areas of highest fishing pressure, while the lowest values were found in tributary headwaters, where landscape modification is a significant threat. We recommend that managers consider the regional and local threats to these populations and tailor strategies accordingly, strategies which should ensure the ability of young A. gigas to disperse through floodplain corridors to maintain genetic diversity among otherwise sedentary adult sub-populations."

Methods This cross-sectional island-wide survey was conducted by two trained medical graduates, who visited each thalassemia center to collect data from every patient, using a standardized form. Data was collected through review of patient registers and clinical records. Results We collected data on 1774 patients from 23 centers. 1219 patients (68.7%) had homozygous β-thalassemia, 360 patients (20.3%) had hemoglobin E β-thalassemia, and 50 patients (2%) had sickle β-thalassemia. There were unacceptably high serum ferritin levels in almost all centers. The annual number of births of patients with β-thalassaemia varied between 45–55, with little evidence of reduction over 19 years. Conclusions Central coordination of the treatment and ultimately prevention of thalassemia is urgently needed in Sri Lanka. Development of expert centers with designated staff with sufficient resources will improve the quality of care and is preferred to managing patients in multiple small units."

Here, we investigated whether, and if so, how batroxobin restores ischemic tissue injury in terms of anti-inflammatory effects. In an in vitro flow cytometry assay for human neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), batroxobin (DF-521; Defibrase) inhibited human NETs induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the presence of human fibrinogen. Next, the effect of batroxobin was investigated by immunohistochemistry of the anterior tibial muscle (ATM) in an ischemic hindlimb model using C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally injected with DF-521 versus the saline control. NETs and fibrinogen deposition in the ischemic ATM decreased in DF-521-treated mice on day 2 after ischemia. Meanwhile, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR assay of the ischemic ATM unveiled continuous downregulation in the expression of the genes; Tnf-α and nitric oxide synthase2 (Nos2) with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (Hif-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor-a (Vegf-a) from day 3 to day 7, but the upregulation of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and placental growth factor (Plgf) with myogenin (Myog) on day 7. Daily intraperitoneal DF-521 injection for the initial 7 days into mice with ischemic hindlimbs promoted angiogenesis and arteriogenesis on day 14. Moreover, DF-521 injection accelerated myofiber maturation after day 14. Laser doppler imaging analysis revealed that blood perfusion in DF-521-injected mice significantly improved on day 14 versus the saline control. Thus, DF-521 improves microcirculation by protecting NETs with tissue defibrinogenation, thereby protecting against severe ischemic tissue injury and accelerating vascular and skeletal muscular regeneration. To our knowledge, batroxobin might be the first clinically applicable NET inhibitor against ischemic diseases."

The beneficial effects of relaxin peptide treatment were demonstrated in clinically relevant animal models of liver fibrosis. However, the use of relaxin is problematic because of a short half-life. The aim of this study was to test the therapeutic effects of recently identified small molecule agonists of the human relaxin receptor, relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1). The lead compound of this series, ML290, was selected based on its effects on the expression of fibrosis-related genes in primary human stellate cells. RNA sequencing analysis of TGF-β1-activated LX-2 cells showed that ML290 treatment primarily affected extracellular matrix remodeling and cytokine signaling, with expression profiles indicating an antifibrotic effect of ML290. ML290 treatment in human liver organoids with LPS-induced fibrotic phenotype resulted in a significant reduction of type I collagen. The pharmacokinetics of ML290 in mice demonstrated its high stability in vivo, as evidenced by the sustained concentrations of compound in the liver. In mice expressing human RXFP1 gene treated with carbon tetrachloride, ML290 significantly reduced collagen content, α-smooth muscle actin expression, and cell proliferation around portal ducts.

Iron homeostasis in mammals requires sustained postnatal intestinal iron absorption that maintains intracellular iron concentrations for central and systemic metabolism as well as for erythropoiesis and oxygen transport. More than 1 billion people worldwide suffer from iron deficiency anemia (IDA), a state of systemic iron insufficiency that limits the production of red blood cells and leads to tissue hypoxia and intracellular iron stress. Despite this tremendous public health concern, very few genetic models of IDA are available to study its progression. Here we developed and characterized a novel genetic mouse model of IDA. We found that tamoxifen-inducible deletion of the mammalian iron exporter ferroportin exclusively in intestinal epithelial cells leads to loss of intestinal iron absorption. Ferroportin ablation yielded a robust phenotype of progressive IDA that develops in as little as 3 months following disruption of intestinal iron absorption. We noted that, at end-stage IDA, tissue-specific transcriptional stress responses occur in which the heart shows little to no hypoxic and iron stress compared with other peripheral organs. However, morphometric and echocardiographic analysis revealed massive cardiac hypertrophy and chamber dilation, albeit with increased cardiac output at very low basal heart rates. We propose that our intestine-specific ferroportin knockout mouse model of end-stage IDA could be used in future studies to investigate IDA progression and cell-specific responses to hypoxic and iron stress."
https://openalex.org/W2967049462,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the first line of defense against pathogens and their activation needs to be tightly regulated in order to limit deleterious effects. Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroïd-derived 2)-like 2) transcription factor regulates oxidative stress and/or represses inflammation in various cells such as dendritic cells or macrophages. However, its involvement in PMN biology is still unclear. Using Nrf2 KO mice, we thus aimed to investigate the protective role of Nrf2 in various PMN functions such as oxidative burst, netosis, migration, cytokine production and phagocytosis, mainly in response to zymosan. We found that zymosan induced Nrf2 accumulation in PMNs leading to the upregulation of some target genes including Hmox-1, Nqo1 and Cat. Nrf2 was able to decrease zymosan-induced PMN oxidative burst; sulforaphane-induced Nrf2 hyperexpression confirmed its implication. Tnfα, Ccl3 and Cxcl2 gene transcription was decreased in zymosan-stimulated Nrf2 KO PMNs, suggesting a role for Nrf2 in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production. However, Nrf2 was not involved in phagocytosis. Finally, spontaneous migration of Nrf2 KO PMNs was lower than that of WT PMNs. Moreover, in response to low concentrations of CXCL2 or CXCL12, Nrf2 KO PMN migration was decreased despite similar CXCR2 and CXCR4 expression and ATP levels in PMNs from both genotypes. Nrf2 thus seems to be required for an optimal migration. Altogether these results suggest that Nrf2 has a protective role in several PMN functions. In particular, it downregulates their activation in response to zymosan and is required for an adequate migration."
https://openalex.org/W2967468337,"Radiation therapy (RT) is a cornerstone of treatment in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), yet treatment failure and disease recurrence are common. The p38/MK2 pathway is activated in response to cellular stressors, including radiation, and promotes tumor inflammation in a variety of cancers. We investigated MK2 pathway activation in HNSCC and the interaction of MK2 and RT in vitro and in vivo. We used a combination of an oropharyngeal SCC tissue microarray, HNSCC cell lines, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor models to study the effect of RT on MK2 pathway activation and to determine how inhibition of MK2 by pharmacologic (PF-3644022) and genetic (siRNA) methods impacts tumor growth. We show that high phosphorylated MK2 (p-MK2) levels are associated with worsened disease-specific survival in p16-negative HNSCC patients. RT increased p-MK2 in both p16-positive, HPV-positive and p16-negative, HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines. Pharmacologic inhibition or gene silencing of MK2 in vitro abrogated RT-induced increases in p-MK2; inflammatory cytokine expression and expression of the downstream MK2 target, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27); and markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mouse PDX models treated with a combination of RT and MK2 inhibitor experienced decreased tumor growth and increased survival. Our results suggest that MK2 is a potential prognostic biomarker for head and neck cancer and that MK2 pathway activation can mediate radiation resistance in HNSCC."

https://openalex.org/W2968848364,"Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and its ligand, serum macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), are well-established oncogenic drivers for tumorigenesis and metastasis. RON is often found to be alternatively spliced resulting in various isoforms that are constitutively active. RON is therefore an attractive target for cancer therapeutics, including small molecular inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies. While small molecule inhibitors of RON may inhibit other protein kinases including the highly similar MET kinase, monoclonal antibodies targeting RON are more specific, potentially inducing fewer side effects. Although anti-RON monoclonal antibody therapies have been developed and tested in clinical trials, they were met with limited success. Cancer cells have been associated with aberrant glycosylation mechanisms. Notably for RON, the loss of N-bisected glycosylation is a direct cause for tumorigenesis and poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Particularly in gastric cancer, aberrant RON glycosylation augments RON activation. Here, we present a novel panel of monoclonal antibodies which potentially widens the specific targeting of not only the glycosylated RON, but also unglycosylated and aberrantly glycosylated RON. Our antibodies can bind strongly to deglycosylated RON from tunicamycin treated cells, recognise RON in IHC/IF and possess superior therapeutic efficacy in RON expressing xenograft tumours. Our most potent antibody in xenograft assays, is directed to the RON alpha chain and targets a sulfhydryl bond constrained epitope that appears to be cryptic in the crystal structure. This establishes the paradigm that such constrained and cryptic epitopes represent good targets for therapeutic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2966964169,"Notophthalmus viridescens (Red-spotted Newt) possess amazing capabilities to regenerate their organs and other tissues. Previously, using a de novo assembly of the newt transcriptome combined with proteomic validation, our group identified a novel family of five protein members expressed in adult tissues during regeneration in Notophthalmus viridescens. The presence of a putative signal peptide suggests that all these proteins are secretory in nature. Here we employed iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) server to generate three-dimensional structure of these novel Newt proteins and predicted their function. Our data suggests that these proteins could act as ion transporters, and be involved in redox reaction(s). Due to absence of transgenic approaches in N. viridescens, and conservation of genetic machinery across species, we generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster to misexpress these genes. Expression of 2775 transcripts were compared between these five newly identified Newt genes. We found that genes involved in the developmental process, cell cycle, apoptosis, and immune response are among those that are highly enriched. To validate the RNA Seq. data, expression of six highly regulated genes were verified using real time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). These graded gene expression patterns provide insight into the function of novel protein family identified in Newt, and layout a map for future studies in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2967793617,"A point cloud that is obtained by an RGB-D camera will inevitably be affected by outliers that do not belong to the surface of the object, which is due to the different viewing angles, light intensities, and reflective characteristics of the object surface and the limitations of the sensors. An effective and fast outlier removal method based on RGB-D information is proposed in this paper. This method aligns the color image to the depth image, and the color mapping image is converted to an HSV image. Then, the optimal segmentation threshold of the V image that is calculated by using the Otsu algorithm is applied to segment the color mapping image into a binary image, which is used to extract the valid point cloud from the original point cloud with outliers. The robustness of the proposed method to the noise types, light intensity and contrast is evaluated by using several experiments; additionally, the method is compared with other filtering methods and applied to independently developed foot scanning equipment. The experimental results show that the proposed method can remove all type of outliers quickly and effectively."

The aim of this study was to define and contrast an explanatory model that makes it possible to analyse the relationships between self-concept, empathy and violent behaviours in schoolchildren through structural equation analysis. The sample of this study is made up of 734 schoolchildren from the province of Granada (Spain), both male and female, aged between 10 and 12, and it consists of analysing self-concept (AF-5), empathy levels (TECA) and violent behaviour at schools (ECV). A structural equation model was performed and successfully adjusted (χ2 = 563.203; DF = 59; p < 0.001; CFI = 0.943; NFI = 0.937; IFI = 0.943; RMSEA = 0.076). A positive and direct relationship between self-concept and cognitive empathy has been found; manifest aggression is negatively related to self-concept. Similarly, affective empathy has a negative relationship with relational aggression. The main conclusions of this study are that the levels of self-concept and empathy represent protective factors against the development of violent and victimisation behaviours in schoolchildren."
https://openalex.org/W2968686466,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) receptor type Z (PTPRZ) has two receptor isoforms, PTPRZ-A and -B, containing tandem intracellular PTP-D1 and -D2 domains, with only D1 being active. Pleiotrophin (PTN) binding to the extracellular PTPRZ region leads to inactivation of its PTPase activity, thereby facilitating oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and myelination in the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms responsible for PTN-induced PTPRZ inactivation remain unclear. We herein report that the crystal structure of the intracellular region of PTPRZ (PTPRZ-ICR) shows a ""head-to-toe""-type dimer conformation, with D2 masking the catalytic site of D1. MS analyses revealed that PTPRZ-ICR proteins remain in monomer-dimer equilibrium in aqueous solution and that a substrate-derived inhibitory peptide or competitive inhibitor (SCB4380) specifically bind to the monomer form in a 1:1 ratio. A D2 deletion (ΔD2) or dimer interface mutation (DDKK) disrupted dimer formation, but SCB4380 binding was maintained. Similar to WT PTPRZ-B, monomer-biased PTPRZ-B-ΔD2 and PTPRZ-B-DDKK variants efficiently dephosphorylated p190RhoGAP at Tyr-1105 when co-expressed in BHK-21 cells. The catalytic activities of these variants were not suppressed by PTN treatment, but were inhibited by the cell-permeable PTPase inhibitor NAZ2329. Of note, the PTN treatment did not enhance OPC differentiation in primary cultured glial cells from ΔD2 or PTPase-inactive PTPRZ-B (CS) mutant knock-in mice. Our results thus indicate that PTN-induced PTPRZ inactivation results from dimer formation of the intracellular tandem PTP domains in a head-to-toe configuration, which is physiologically relevant to the control of OPC differentiation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2950648929,"Background Active living approaches seek to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time across different domains, including through active travel. However, there is little information on how movement behaviours in different domains relate to each other. We used compositional data analysis to explore associations between active commuting and patterns of movement behaviour during discretionary time. Methods and findings We analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the UK Biobank study. At baseline (2006–2010) and follow up (2009–2013) participants reported their mode of travel to work, dichotomised as active (walking, cycling or public transport) or inactive (car). Participants also reported activities performed during discretionary time, categorised as (i) screen time; (ii) walking for pleasure; and (iii) sport and do-it-yourself (DIY) activities, summed to produce a total. We applied compositional data analysis to test for associations between active commuting and the composition and total amount of discretionary time, using linear regression models adjusted for covariates. Adverse events were not investigated in this observational analysis. The survey response rate was 5.5%. In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 182,406; mean age = 52 years; 51% female), active commuters engaged in relatively less screen time than those who used inactive modes (coefficient -0.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.13 to -0.11), equating to approximately 60 minutes less screen time per week. Similarly, in the longitudinal analysis (n = 4,323; mean age = 51 years; 49% female) there were relative reductions in screen time in those who used active modes at both time points compared with those who used inactive modes at both time points (coefficient -0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.24 to -0.06), equating to a difference between these commute groups of approximately 30 minutes per week at follow up. However, as exposures and outcomes were measured concurrently, reverse causation is possible. Conclusions Active commuting was associated with a more favourable pattern of movement behaviour during discretionary time. Active commuters accumulated 30–60 minutes less screen time per week than those using inactive modes. Though modest, this could have a cumulative effect on health over time."
https://openalex.org/W2967919464,"Escherichia coli serotype O9a provides a model for export of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen polysaccharide (O-PS) via ABC transporters. In O9a biosynthesis, a chain-terminator enzyme, WbdD, caps the nonreducing end of the glycan with a methylphosphate moiety and thereby establishes chain-length distribution. A carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) in the ABC transporter recognizes terminated glycans, ensuring that only mature O-PS is exported and incorporated into LPS. Here, we addressed two questions arising from this model. Are both residues in the binary terminator necessary for termination and export? And is a terminal methylphosphate moiety sufficient for export of heterologous glycans? To answer the first question, we uncoupled WbdD kinase and methyltransferase activities. WbdD mutants revealed that although the kinase activity is solely responsible for chain-length regulation, both activities are essential for CBM recognition and export. Consistent with this observation, a saturation transfer difference NMR experiment revealed a direct interaction between the CBM and the terminal methyl group. To determine whether methylphosphate is the sole determinant of substrate recognition by the CBM, we exploited Klebsiella pneumoniae O7, whose O-PS repeat-unit structure differs from O9a, but, as shown here, offers the second confirmed example of a terminal methylphosphate serving in substrate recognition. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that each CBM can bind the O-PS only with the native repeat unit, revealing that methylphosphate is essential but not sufficient for substrate recognition and export.

Overexpression and gain-of-function mutations in EZH2 are regarded as oncogenic drivers in lymphoma and other malignancies due to the silencing of tumor suppressors and differentiation genes. EZH2 inhibition is sought to represent a good strategy for tumor therapy. In this study, we treated Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an indirect EZH2 inhibitor which possesses anticancer properties both in-vitro and in-vivo. We aimed to address the impact of the lymphoma type, EZH2 mutation status, as well as MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 translocations on the sensitivity of the lymphoma cell lines to DZNep-mediated apoptosis. We show that DZNep inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of these cell lines independent of the type of lymphoma, the EZH2 mutation status and the MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangement status. Furthermore, DZNep induced a much stronger apoptosis in majority of these cell lines at a lower concentration, and within a shorter period when compared with EPZ-6438, a direct EZH2 inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials. Apoptosis induction by DZNep was both concentration-dependent and time-dependent, and was associated with the inhibition of EZH2 and subsequent downregulation of H3K27me3 in DZNep-sensitive cell lines. Although EZH2, MYC, BCL2 and BCL6 are important prognostic biomarkers for lymphomas, our study shows that they poorly influence the sensitivity of lymphoma cell lines to DZNep-mediated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2967378556,"A novel biosorbent, Eupatorium adenophorum Sprengel-alginate beads was used for chromium(VI) biosorption from aqueous solutions. Biosorption process was optimized at pH 2.0, biomass concentration 1.0 g/L, contact time 60 min, and temperature 30 oC respectively. Maximum uptake capacity of Cr(VI) was calculated at 28.011 mg/g. It was found that the overall biosorption process was best described by pseudo second-order kinetics with high correlation coefficient values. Intraparticle diffusion model suggested that Cr(VI) biosorption may proceed within multiple steps. Data obtained from the batch studies confirmed well to the Langmuir, Temkin, and Hill-der Boer isotherm models. Scatchard plot analysis further supported the mono-layer biosorption of Cr(VI) ions on Eupatorium adenophorum Sprengel-alginate beads as described by Langmuir isotherm model. Numerical values of E obtained from Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm model identified the physisorption as predominant mechanism for Cr(VI) biosorption. The negative values of ΔGo confirmed the spontaneous and feasibility nature, whereas positive value of ΔHo showed the endothermic nature of biosorption process. Positive value of ΔSo indicated an increase in the randomness at the solid/solution interface during the biosorption process. The endothermic nature of Cr(VI) biosorption was also described by Temkin isotherm model. The results indicated that Cr(VI) biosorption was not significantly affected by the presence of co-ions at lower concentrations. Desorption of Cr(VI) ions from metal-loaded Eupatorium adenophorum-alginate beads was observed at 92.091% with 0.5 M HNO3 solution in solid to liquid ratio of 1.0 g/L."

However, their associations have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated associations between VEGF and four specific VEGF mRNA isoforms with levels of 11 inflammation molecules, derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) extracts. Methods Healthy participants from the STANISLAS Family Study (n = 285) were included. Levels of VEGF (four mRNA isoforms and protein levels) and inflammatory molecules (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, INF-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, EGF) were measured in PBMCs extracts. Multiple regression analyses were performed, adjusted for age and gender. Results The analyses revealed significant associations between VEGF protein levels and levels of IL-4 (β = 0.028, P = 0.013), MCP-1 (β = 0.015, P<0.0001) and EGF (β = 0.017, P<0.0001). Furthermore, mRNA isoform VEGF165 was associated with MCP-1 and IL-1α (P = 0.002 and P = 0.008, respectively); and mRNA isoform VEGF189 was associated with IL-4 and IL-6 (P = 0.019 and P = 0.034, respectively). Conclusions To our knowledge, the present study represents the first investigation that successfully demonstrates links between VEGF protein levels and inflammatory molecules levels derived from PBMCs extracts and identifies associations between specific VEGF mRNA isoforms and inflammatory molecules. Impact These findings provide novel insights that may assist in the development of new tissue and mRNA isoform specific measurements of VEGF levels, which may positively contribute to predicting the risk of common complex diseases and response of currently used anti-VEGF agents, and developing of novel targeted therapies for VEGF-related pathophysiology."

Over recent decades, human activities (e.g. rural abandonment, monoculture plantations) and global warming are magnifying the risk of fire, with changes in fire intensity and frequency. Here, we offer the first study that examines the impact of fire on the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca living in a native cork oak forest and pine plantation in north-western Africa. A total of 44 transects (22 burnt and 22 unburnt) were sampled at 8 sites affected by fires of natural cork oak forest and pine plantation with 8 surveys per site in 2015–2017 (264 hours of sampling effort). Tortoise densities were estimated with line-transect distance sampling. The detection probability of tortoises was higher in burnt (0.915) than unburnt (0.474) transects. The density of tortoises was negatively associated with elevation and declined with fire by c. 50% in both forest types. The negative response of T. graeca to fire should be considered in conservation planning of this species in north-western Africa in a future scenario of changes in fire regime."

A total of 47 wild rodents, identified as Apodemus agrarius (A. agrarius), were captured from June to August 2016. The seroprevalence of antibodies against bacterial pathogens in A. agrarius sera was analyzed; 17.4% (8/46) were identified as O. tsutsugamushi through indirect immunofluorescence assay and 2.2% (1/46) were identified as Leptospira species through passive hemagglutination assay. Using polymerase chain reaction, the spleen, kidney and blood samples were investigated for the presence of O. tsutsugamushi, A. phagocytophilum, and L. interrogans. Out of the 47 A. agrarius, 19.1% (9/47) were positive for A. phagocytophilum and 6.4% (3/47) were positive for L. interrogans, while none were positive for O. tsutsugamushi. Four out of 46 (8.7%) blood samples, six out of 45 (13.3%) spleen samples, and one out of 47 (2.1%) kidney samples were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Three out of 47 (6.4%) kidney samples were positive for L. interrogans. The sequencing results of PCR positive samples demonstrated > 99% similarity with A. phagocytophilum and L. interrogans sequences. A. phagocytophilum was mostly detected in the spleen, whereas L. interrogans was mostly detected in the kidneys.

Karim A.S. Jewett M.C. Cell-free metabolic engineering: Biomanufacturing beyond the cell.Biotechnol. J. 2015; 10 (25319678): 69-8210.1002/biot.201400330Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The commercial feasibility of these systems is mainly governed by the cost to produce the enzymes. Hence, there is great interest in the ability to reuse complete enzyme cascades through enzyme immobilization in cell-free systems. This would increase the cost-effectiveness and could make cell-free systems industrially competitive. Examples of demonstrated cascades include a combination of glucose oxidase (GOx) 2The abbreviations used are: GOxglucose oxidaseaaamino acidASDaldose sugar dehydrogenaseBBBinding BufferDCIP2,6-dichlorophenolindophenolHPAEChigh-performance anion exchange chromatographyPNFprotein nanofibrilsPQQpyrroloquinoline quinonePQQH2reduced pyrroloquinoline quinoneRTroom temperatureSup35Sup35(1–61)TEMtransmission EMXOSxylobiose to xylopenatoseβXylβ-xylosidase IIXynAxylanase A. and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which were bound onto DNA (10Fu J.

Soc. 2012; 134 (22414276): 5516-551910.1021/ja300897hCrossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the combined enzymes show a spatial distance-dependent activity. To increase the enzymatic efficiency of the cascade, compartmentalization of lipase B, GOx, and HRP in polymersomes is another promising strategy (11van Dongen S.F. Nallani M. Cornelissen J.J. Nolte R.J. van Hest J.C. A three-enzyme cascade reaction through positional assembly of enzymes in a polymersome nanoreactor.Chemistry. 2009; 15 (19072950): 1107-111410.1002/chem.200802114Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This applies also to GOx and HRP trapped in hydrogels (12Liang H. Jiang S. Yuan Q. Li G. Wang F. Zhang Z. Liu J.

Another more advanced reaction cascade combines ribokinase, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase, engineered hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, adenylate kinase, and pyruvate kinase to produce nucleotide analogues (13Scism R.A. Bachmann B.O. Five-component cascade synthesis of nucleotide analogues in an engineered self-immobilized enzyme aggregate.Chembiochem. 2010; 11 (19918830): 67-7010.1002/cbic.200900620Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

Today, enzyme immobilization can be attained through a versatile toolbox, which includes chemical, photochemical, or adsorptive methods that tether the enzyme to appropriate materials (14Jia F. Narasimhan B. Mallapragada S. Materials-based strategies for multi-enzyme immobilization and co-localization: A review.Biotechnol.

Our approach to assemble an enzymatic cascade relies on covalent enzyme immobilization without using chemistry. To achieve this, we produced chimeric proteins, which are genetic fusions of enzymes and amyloidogenic peptides. The amyloidogenic peptide Sup35(1–61) (Sup35) is a truncated yeast transcription termination factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which aggregates into highly ordered β-sheet secondary structures under physiological conditions (16Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M. Liu J.J. Lindquist S. Self-seeded fibers formed by Sup35, the protein determinant of [PSI+], a heritable prion-like factor of S. cerevisiae.Cell. 1997; 89 (9182769): 811-81910.1016/s0092-8674(00)80264-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 17Men D.

Accordingly, the chimeric proteins self-assemble into protein nanofibrils (PNF), also known as amyloid, and display the enzymes homogenously on the surface (Fig. 1). The material displays a high surface-to-volume ratio, which ensures a high functional density. The method of enzyme immobilization through protein display on PNFs is an established procedure and has been implemented with various enzymes in proof-of-concept studies (18Zhou X.M. Shimanovich U.

However, in most cases, the functionality is demonstrated on single-enzyme systems only. An exception is recently developed bacterial amyloid, which was used to assemble a two-enzyme cascade (24Nussbaumer M.G. Nguyen P.Q. Tay P.K.R. Naydich A. Hysi E. Botyanszki Z. Joshi N.S. Bootstrapped biocatalysis: Biofilm-derived materials as reversibly functionalizable multienzyme surfaces.ChemCatChem. 2017; 9 (30519367): 4328-433310.1002/cctc.201701221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the type of characterizations reported for enzyme functionalized amyloid have often a qualitative nature. This means that kinetic data for the optimization of the system with respect to the relative enzyme amount, pH, or temperature to maximize the product yield are missing. Nevertheless, kinetic characterization of the cascade is of great importance if the materials are developed for industrial processes. The objective of this work was to fill this gap and develop a biocatalytic cascade, based upon PNF functionalized with enzymatic activities. Our concept relies on the processing of xylan from beechwood in three discrete enzymatic steps. Xylan is a highly abundant polysaccharide and constitutes up to 35% of plant cell walls (25Bajpai P. Xylan: Occurrence and structure in Xylanolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Amsterdam2014: 9-18Google Scholar). The wide availability of xylan renders it an appropriate sustainable resource, which is one of the key ingredients that accelerate the interest to utilize this biomass (26Linares-Pastén J.A. Aronsson A. Karlsson E.N. Structural considerations on the use of endo-xylanases for the production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides from biomass.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2018; 19 (27670134): 48-6710.2174/1389203717666160923155209PubMed Google Scholar). Xylan is easily hydrolyzed to xylose with hydrochloric acid and heat, but biomass conversion using biocatalysts is acid-free and environmentally friendly. Thus, the biochemical method has a high potential to compete with the classical method, also in economic terms (27Mohite B.V. Patil S.V. Gupta V.K. Impact of microbial cellulases on microbial cellulose biotechnology. in New and Future Developments in Microbial Biotechnology and Bioengineering: Microbial Cellulase System Properties and Applications. Elsevier, Cambridge, MA2016: 31-4010.1016/B978-0-444-63507-5.00004-6Google Scholar). The enzymatic depolymerization of polysaccharides, for example, hemicellulose to monomeric sugars, requires a combined effort of xylanolytic enzymes (endoxylanase and β-xylosidase) (28Juturu V. Wu J.C. Microbial xylanases: Engineering, production and industrial applications.Biotechnol. Adv. 2012; 30 (22138412): 1219-122710.1016/j.biotechadv.2011.11.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Hemicellulose is a branched heteropolymer consisting of pentose (xylose and arabinose) and hexose (mannose, glucose, and galactose) sugars, whereas xylose is the major component and constitutes the main chain (29Kumar R. Singh S. Singh O.V. Bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass: Biochemical and molecular perspectives.J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2008; 35 (18338189): 377-39110.1007/s10295-008-0327-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Because of the product inhibition caused by the xylooligosaccharides (xylobiose to xylopenatose (XOS)) produced by xylanase, β-xylosidases are usually considered the bottleneck in hemicellulose biodegradation (30Poutanen K. Puls J. Characteristics of Trichoderma reesei β-xylosidase and its use in the hydrolysis of solubilized xylans.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1988; 28: 425-43210.1007/BF00268208Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To assemble the PNF-based cascade reaction, we chose to functionalize the PNF with enzymes that are monomeric and stable and that were previously produced in Escherichia coli. The enzymes xylanase A (XynA) from Bacillus subtilis (31Bourgois T.M. Nguyen D.V. Sansen S. Rombouts S. Beliën T. Fierens K. Raedschelders G. Rabijns A. Courtin C.M. Delcour J.A. Van Campenhout S.

Xylonolactone is readily converted to xylonic acid by chemical or enzymatic means. Xylonic acid is a strategically important chemical for a bio-based economy and could, for instance, be used to synthesize co-polyamides (7Toivari M.H. Nygård Y. Penttilä M. Ruohonen L. Wiebe M.G.

To maximize the product yield, this three-step biocatalytic reaction was characterized with respect to the optimal pH, temperature stability, and relative enzyme concentration. Our method to functionalize Sup35 fibrils involves co-fibrillation of an amyloidogenic peptide (carrier protein) together with the chimeric construct by adding sonicated seeds. To fibrillate at least 85% after a 24-h incubation, we empirically optimized the fibrillation conditions by varying the relative ratio of seed, chimeric, and carrier protein (Fig. 3A). After their formation, the fibrils were imaged with transmission EM (TEM). The width of the fibrils was on average 13 nm (Sup35-xylanase A/Sup35 fibrils (CXynAfib)), 20 nm (Sup35–β-xylosidase II/Sup35 fibrils (CβXylfib)), and 16 nm (Sup35-aldose sugar dehydrogenase/Sup35 fibrils (CASDfib)) (Fig. 3B, the width of the Sup35 fibril core is 5 nm) (37Schmuck B. Sandgren M. Härd T. A fine-tuned composition of protein nanofibrils yields an upgraded functionality of displayed antibody binding domains.Biotechnol. J. 2017; 12 (28371185): 160067210.1002/biot.201600672Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The difference in width corresponds well to the molecular mass of the protein chimeras, 29.8 kDa, 64.5 kDa, and 48.3 kDa for CXynAfib, CβXylfib, and CASDfib, respectively. It is also interesting to note that CXynAfib and CβXylfib fibrils are longer than 1 μm, whereas CASDfib are much shorter and have a length between 90 and 400 nm. Because fibrils with a higher tensile strength grow longer (38Knowles T.P.J. Buehler M.J. Nanomechanics of functional and pathological amyloid materials.Nat. Nanotechnol. 2011; 6 (21804553): 469-47910.1038/nnano.2011.102Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), we speculate that CASDfib are shorter, because integrating CASD into Sup35 fibrils may lead to a different folding pattern of the core compared with the other protein chimera. Frequently, a reduced catalytic efficiency accompanies the display of enzymes on PNF (39Wang Y. Pu J. An B. Lu T.K. Zhong C. Emerging paradigms for synthetic design of functional amyloids.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 (29702108): 3720-373410.1016/j.jmb.2018.04.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The origin of this effect is probably because of steric restrictions when only chimeric proteins are used for fibril assembly. Therefore, we assembled the fibrils with a reduced enzyme packing density (Fig. 1). In an earlier study, we had demonstrated that an apparent reduction of the catalytic efficiency of these fibrils in suspension can be attributed to mass transport limitations only (23Schmuck B. Sandgren M. Härd T. The kinetics of TEM1 antibiotic degrading enzymes that are displayed on Ure2 protein nanofibrils in a flow reactor.PLoS One. 2018; 13 (29684061): e019625010.1371/journal.pone.0196250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The mass transport limitations can be counteracted if the fibrils are trapped on a filter and the substrate is delivered by flow, not diffusion. Regarding CXynAfib and CβXylfib, kcat and Km were comparable to the soluble enzyme (Table 1, Table 2). It was concluded that neither mass transport limitation nor steric restrictions significantly affected the enzyme. The same was true for CASDfib, the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of CASD and CASDfib was almost identical. However, the fibrils did not show a particularly high tolerance toward increased temperature. At room temperature (RT), CASDfib were finely distributed, but immediately and irreversibly clumped together if they were incubated at 37 °C or if they were subjected to even mild agitation (100 rpm) (Fig. 3C).Table 1Catalytic constants of soluble Sup35 fusion proteinsEnzyme fusionskcatKmkcat/Kmmin−1mmmm−1 min−1CXynAa37 °C, pH 6, substrate: XylX6.1840 ± 350.3 ± <0.16053 ± 259CβXylb37 °C, pH 6, substrate: pNP-X.1266 ± 557.4 ± 0.7172 ± 10CASDcroom temperature, pH 8.5, substrate: xylose.285 ± 12382 ± 450.75 ± 0.06a 37 °C, pH 6, substrate: XylX6.b 37 °C, pH 6, substrate: pNP-X.c room temperature, pH 8.5, substrate: xylose.

Open table in a new tab Prior to combining CXynA, CβXyl, and CASD we wanted to achieve a better understanding of the interplay of CXynA and CβXyl that liberates xylose from xylan. Previous reports have found that pH 6.0 is the catalytic optimum for βXyl (32Corrêa J.M. Graciano L. Abrahão J. Loth E.A. Gandra R.F. Kadowaki M.K. Henn C. de Cássia Garcia Simão R.

To evaluate the efficacy of a combined pH optimum for CβXyl and CXynA we studied the time-dependent accumulation of xylose and XOS using pH values 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0. In addition, because we expected that the β-xylosidase would be limiting, the concentration of CβXyl was incrementally increased to reach a 30-fold molar excess over CXynA (Fig. 4A and Figs. S1–S3). From these experiments, we could indeed conclude that the concentration of xylanase was not rate-limiting in the CXynA/CβXyl enzyme mixture with regard to xylose production. At a constant molar concentration of 0.4 μm CXynA in combination with 0–12 μm CβXyl, the xylose yield (24 h at 37 °C) steadily increased if more CβXyl was added to the reaction (Fig. S3). This dependence was not linear, which implied that adding more than 12 μm would not accelerate the reaction substantially. For instance, in the absence of CβXyl, 4% of the total amount of the XOS is xylose, if the hydrolysis was carried out for 24 h at pH 6. A CβXyl concentration of 1.2 μm elevated the xylose fraction to 18%. However, 10-fold more CβXyl increased the xylose content only 3.5-fold to 64% (Fig. 4A). The same conditions, but a higher pH (6.5, 7.0) resulted in reduced xylose production, although the overall XOS formation was not changed significantly. Consequently, the ratios of the formed XOS were skewed toward the longer XOS (Fig. 4A), which is indicative of a loss of β-xylosidase activity only. Next, we investigated how the enzymes would perform using optimal condition with regard to xylose production as determined by the previous assay (pH 6, 24 h, 37 °C, 0.4 μm CXynA, 12 μm CβXyl), but with the enzymes displayed on the fibrils. A comparison of the soluble enzyme with the fibril-catalyzed reaction revealed that the relative amounts of xylose and XOS were identical (Fig. 4C). In addition, the total product concentration of 3.1 mg/ml (Table S4) was identical between soluble and fibril-associated enzymes, which indicated that the enzyme activity was not significantly affected by immobilization on PNF. Another crucial characteristic of the fibrils is the temperature dependence of the CXynAfib/CβXylfib reaction, both in terms of xylose yield and long-term stability. If the fibrils are used only once, the relative xylose to XOS concentration is maximized at 49 °C (74% after 24 h and 95% after 48 h) (Fig. 4B and Fig. S7). Repeated recycling of the CXynAfib/CβXylfib fibril suspension resulted in a substantial decrease in the enzymatic activity over time at temperatures above 37 °C. Recycling the fibrils at 33 °C resulted in minimal losses of relative activity after eight consecutive 24-h reactions (Fig. 5A and Fig. S7), compared with the second round at 49 °C, which only yielded 25% of the xylose produced during the first round. Because the effect on xylose yield was greater than the effect on XOS accumulation, this highlighted the sensitivity of the catalysis to perturbations in the β-xylosidase activity. If the βXyl enzyme is not engineered or replaced, temperatures above 33 °C will only confer small benefits to the reaction yield if the fibrils are to be reused. However, if the fibrils are intended for single use, a temperature of 45 °C would be preferred, as it yielded the highest amount of xylose after 24 h (Fig. S3). To elucidate possible mass transport limitations of the CXynAfib/CβXylfib enzyme mixture, product formation was analyzed over time with increasing agitation speed (Fig. 5B). As observed earlier, the total xylose yield was identical between soluble and fibril-associated CXynAfib/CβXylfib without agitation. However, the fraction of the XOS hydrolyzed to xylose is increased at 500"
https://openalex.org/W2967990076,"Silene latifolia is a dioecious flowering plant with sex chromosomes in the family Caryophyllaceae. Development of a gynoecium and stamens are suppressed in the male and female flowers of S. latifolia, respectively. Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae promotes stamen development when it infects the female flower. If suppression of the stamen and gynoecium development is regulated by the same mechanism, suppression of gynoecium and stamen development is released simultaneously with the infection by M. lychnidis-dioicae. To assess this hypothesis, an asexual mutant without a gynoecium or stamen was infected with M. lychnidis-dioicae. A filament of the stamen in the infected asexual mutant was elongated at stages 11 and 12 of flower bud development as well as in the male, but the gynoecium did not form. Instead of the gynoecium, a filamentous structure was suppressed as in the male flower. Developmental suppression of the stamen was released by M. lychnidis-dioicae, but that of gynoecium development was not released. M. lychnidis-dioicae would have a function similar to stamen-promoting factor (SPF), since the elongation of the stamen that is not observed in the healthy asexual mutant was observed after stage 8 of flower bud development. An infection experiment also revealed that a deletion on the Y chromosome of the asexual mutant eliminated genes for maturation of tapetal cells because the tapetal cells did not mature in the asexual mutant infected with M. lychnidis-dioicae."

The most important factors for constructing the nomogram were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis. The discriminative ability and calibration of the nomograms were tested using C-statistics, calibration plots, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results In the training cohort, 1-year and 2-year OS were 52.8% and 28.5% in EGFR(-) patients, and 73.9% and 44.1% in EGFR(+) patients, respectively. In EGFR(+) group, factors selected were age, gender, congestive heart failure, renal disease, number of lymph node examined, tumor stage, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, first-line chemotherapy, ECOG performance status, malignant pleural effusion, and smoking. In EGFR(-) group, factors selected were age, gender, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, number of lymph node examined, tumor stage, surgical intervention, radiotherapy, ECOG performance status, malignant pleural effusion, and a history of smoking. Two nomograms show good accuracy in predicting OS, with a concordance index of 0.83 in EGFR(+) and of 0.88 in EGFR(-). Conclusions The survival prediction models can be used to make individualized predictions with different EGFR mutation status and a useful tool for selecting regimens for treating advanced adenocarcinoma."

It's an unconventional way to end a scientific talk. The inspiration comes from my experiences as an ultrarunner—an athlete who completes runs longer than a standard marathon. The core philosophy of the team I run with—the Some Work, All Play Adventure Team—is that the courage required to pursue any scary adventure is to be celebrated, independent of the outcome. This mentality has helped me tremendously in both my professional and personal pursuits, but it's all too rare in the scientific community.

> “To be amazing is to have the courage to embark on a scary, uncertain adventure.” 

When I started to work toward my Ph.D. 5 years ago, my mindset was completely different. I believed we are defined by results. So, when I made the painful decision to leave my first Ph.D. program after spending my first year battling depression, anxiety, and disordered eating, I couldn't help but see myself as a failure who was incapable of handling the challenges of graduate school. Despite knowing that my mental illness was neither a sign of weakness nor my fault, I felt as far from amazing as humanly possible. My love for research persisted, but I would need to make significant changes if I was ever going to thrive in academia.

I chose to continue my Ph.D. studies at my undergraduate institution, where I would be closer to family, friends, and familiar support networks. But my myopic pursuit of the perfect CV still left me unfulfilled, endlessly chasing outcomes that I expected would finally make me feel like a “successful” scientist.

That started to change when one of my classmates invited me to run a half-marathon. I had never run a race that long, but I decided to give it a go. I wasn't the fastest finisher—far from it. But I was immensely proud that I had the courage to venture into unknown territory. For the first time in my life, I realized that embarking on a challenge can yield fulfillment, regardless of the outcome. I was hooked. Less than a year later, I was racing ultradistance trail events of up to 50 miles.

As any ultrarunner will attest, the highs of endurance sports do not come without extreme lows, too. By participating in a sport where setbacks are more common than successes, I developed a new relationship with failure. Perhaps it seems paradoxical, but when a hip injury forced me to walk at the end of a recent 50-mile race, my slowest miles were accompanied by my biggest smiles.

Earlier in my Ph.D., when experiments failed to support major hypotheses, I would shut down, unwilling to consider the possibility that embedded in the setback was an opportunity to try something new. These days, I still don't like getting negative data. Who does? But I have become more resilient, perceiving obstacles as essential to achieving growth and finding meaning. The adage in ultrarunning is that a race is “life in a day,” because of all the highs and lows an endurance adventure brings. I prefer to think of a race as “a Ph.D. in a day.” Embracing this way of thinking has been transformative.

But I know that many of my fellow scientists struggle to acknowledge missteps or vulnerability, as I once did, which makes it far too easy to feel alone in “failing.” This is why I now end my talks with a “YOU ARE AMAZING” slide. To be amazing does not require achieving recognition, awards, or major publications. To be amazing is to have the courage to embark on a scary, uncertain adventure and journey into the vast unknown.

When this slide comes up, many audience members give an unmistakably authentic smile. Some talk to me afterward; others send messages thanking me. I've even received a few hugs along the way. Of course, some may quietly scoff at the slide. But they, too, are amazing.

Two years later, biomedical scientists are counting themselves lucky. Collins has helped shield NIH from threatened budget cuts as well as the upheaval that has shaken many other federal agencies under the Trump administration. As he completes a decade as NIH director this month, Collins, 69, has been a survivor—he9s one of few top-level holdovers from former President Barack Obama9s administration and has served longer than any other NIH head in 50 years. Observers say Collins has also been one of the most influential directors ever to shape NIH, which with a budget of $39 billion this year is the world9s largest biomedical research agency. Some academic researchers have complained that his centrally managed projects aimed at generating large amounts of data drain resources from curiosity-driven individual grants. Still, even some former critics have come around."
