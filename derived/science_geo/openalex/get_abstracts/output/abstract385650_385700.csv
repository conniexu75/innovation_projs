https://openalex.org/W2119006096,"A Correlated Quantum Walk Random walks are powerful tools for modeling statistical events. The analogous quantum walk involves particles tunneling between available sites. Peruzzo et al. (p. 1500 ; see the Perspective by Hillery ) now report on the quantum walk of a correlated pair of photons propagating through a coupled waveguide array. The output pattern resulting from the injection of two correlated photons possess quantum features, indicating that the photons retain their correlations as they walk randomly through the waveguide array, allowing scale-up and parallel searches over many possible paths."
https://openalex.org/W2146569590,"Glucose Metabolism Revisited Cancer cells are revved up to reproduce rapidly and typically consume glucose rapidly by glycolysis. Why then do cancer cells express an isoform of a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis, pyruvate kinase M2, which has decreased activity? Vander Heiden et al. (p. 1492 ) propose that consequent accumulation of phosphoenolpyruvate, with the help of an enzymatic activity that remains to be characterized, can lead to phosphate transfer to phosphoglycerate mutase, another glycolytic enzyme, providing the cell with a different way to make pyruvate. This may allow cancer cells to produce pyruvate without generating excess adenosine triphosphate, which can act through feedback to inhibit glycolyis."

Knowing their effects in both clean and polluted air is necessary in order to understand their influence (see the Perspective by Baltensperger ). Clarke and Kapustin (p. 1488 ) examine vertical atmospheric profiles collected above the Pacific Ocean, where air quality is affected by the transport of polluted air from the west, and find significant regional enhancements in light scattering, aerosol mass, and aerosol number associated with combustion. Aerosol particle concentrations in this region can exceed values in clean, unperturbed regions by over an order of magnitude. Thus combustion affects hemispheric aerosol optical depth and the distribution of cloud condensation nuclei. Pöschl et al. (p. 1513 ) discuss the composition of aerosols above the Amazon Basin, in the pristine conditions of the rainy season. The aerosols in this region are derived mostly from gaseous biogenic precursors, plants, and microorganisms, and particle concentration is orders of magnitude lower than in polluted continental regions."
https://openalex.org/W2025463010,"Diving into Deep Water The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was one of the largest oil spills on record. Its setting at the bottom of the sea floor posed an unanticipated risk as substantial amounts of hydrocarbons leaked into the deepwater column. Three separate cruises identified and sampled deep underwater hydrocarbon plumes that existed in May and June, 2010—before the well head was ultimately sealed. Camilli et al. (p. 201 ; published online 19 August) used an automated underwater vehicle to assess the dimensions of a stabilized, diffuse underwater plume of oil that was 22 miles long and estimated the daily quantity of oil released from the well, based on the concentration and dimensions of the plume. Hazen et al. (p. 204 ; published online 26 August) also observed an underwater plume at the same depth and found that hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were enriched in the plume and were breaking down some parts of the oil. Finally, Valentine et al. (p. 208 ; published online 16 September) found that natural gas, including propane and ethane, were also present in hydrocarbon plumes. These gases were broken down quickly by bacteria, but primed the system for biodegradation of larger hydrocarbons, including those comprising the leaking crude oil. Differences were observed in dissolved oxygen levels in the plumes (a proxy for bacterial respiration), which may reflect differences in the location of sampling or the aging of the plumes."

Mohrmann et al. (p. 502 , published online 16 September) developed an elegant approach to find out how many SNARE complexes are required to promote secretion of individual secretory vesicles in living chromaffin cells by titrating the ratio of wild-type and mutant SNARE proteins expressed. For fast synchronous release, a minimum of three SNARE complexes per vesicle were required. Fewer SNARE complexes resulted in slower release."
https://openalex.org/W2165538566,"Under Pressure In order to understand the behavior of materials in the solid deep Earth, it is important to be able to estimate how a material melts at high pressure. To this end, Fiquet et al. (p. 1516 ) performed experiments using a laser-heated diamond anvil cell coupled to in situ synchrotron measurements of peridotite rock—a mixture of minerals thought to represent Earth's upper mantle—across a wide pressure range. The results suggest that liquid phases may exist at very high pressure values, such that seismically anomalous zones near the boundary between the core and the mantle may result from isolated pockets of melt. Along similar lines, the base of primitive Earth's mantle may have acquired its trace element signature from partial melting of certain mineral phases higher up in the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2038283518,"Several short antimicrobial peptides that are rich in tryptophan and arginine residues were designed with a series of simple modifications such as end capping and cyclization. The two sets of hexapeptides are based on the Trp- and Arg-rich primary sequences from the ""antimicrobial centre"" of bovine lactoferricin as well as an antimicrobial sequence obtained through the screening of a hexapeptide combinatorial library.HPLC, mass spectrometry and antimicrobial assays were carried out to explore the consequences of the modifications on the serum stability and microbicidal activity of the peptides. The results show that C-terminal amidation increases the antimicrobial activity but that it makes little difference to its proteolytic degradation in human serum. On the other hand, N-terminal acetylation decreases the peptide activities but significantly increases their protease resistance. Peptide cyclization of the hexameric peptides was found to be highly effective for both serum stability and antimicrobial activity. However the two cyclization strategies employed have different effects, with disulfide cyclization resulting in more active peptides while backbone cyclization results in more proteolytically stable peptides. However, the benefit of backbone cyclization did not extend to longer 11-mer peptides derived from the same region of lactoferricin. Mass spectrometry data support the serum stability assay results and allowed us to determine preferred proteolysis sites in the peptides. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that the peptides all had weak interactions with albumin, the most abundant protein in human serum.Taken together, the results provide insight into the behavior of the peptides in human serum and will therefore aid in advancing antimicrobial peptide design towards systemic applications."

Inoue et al. (p. 496 , published online 16 September) found that the gene product of Xist , which normally inactivates one of the two X chromosomes in females, was unexpectedly expressed ectopically from active X chromosomes in cloned mice. When Xist was deleted from the mice, gene expression returned to normal and the efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer increased about ninefold, offering promise for future nuclear transfer technology."

In the lunar highlands, large-impact craters have obliterated preexisting craters of similar size, implying that crater counts in this region cannot be used effectively to determine the age of the underlying terrain.

The silicate mineralogy revealed suggests the existence of more complex igneous processes on the Moon than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2054716809,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) lineages have been identified that are endemic to Bioko Island. The time the island formed offers a geological time scale calibration point for dating the most recent common ancestor of SIV. The Bioko viruses cover the whole range of SIV genetic diversity, and each Bioko SIV clade is most closely related to viruses circulating in hosts of the same genus on the African mainland rather than to SIVs of other Bioko species. Our phylogeographic approach establishes that SIV is ancient and at least 32,000 years old. Our conservative calibration point and analyses of gene sequence saturation and dating bias suggest it may be much older."
https://openalex.org/W1973299341,"Rolling Snowballs The genetic incompatibilities that separate ongoing speciation events have been hypothesized by the Dobzhansky-Muller model of speciation to snowball—that is, accumulate mutations causing postzygotic isolation at a faster rate than the linear accumulation of mutations. This occurs because of potential deleterious epistatic interactions in hybrids involving two or more interacting genes. Testing QTLs (quantitative trait loci) in seed and pollen sterility between multiple species pairs in the plant group Solanum , Moyle and Nakazato (p. 1521 ) show that hybrid female (seed) sterility accumulates exponentially between increasingly distant species pairs, although not for hybrid male (pollen) sterility. In contrast, loci contributing to differences in other traits show no evidence for nonlinear accumulation over time. Matute et al. (p. 1518 ) come to similar conclusions through the use of deletion mapping in comparisons between two pairs of species of Drosophila . The number of genes causing postzygotic isolation grows as fast as the square of the number of substitutions between two species. Thus, a hybrid snowball effect is found in both plants and animals."
https://openalex.org/W1992538179,"Glucose homeostasis in mammals is mainly regulated by insulin signaling. It was previously shown that SIRT6 mutant mice die before 4 weeks of age, displaying profound abnormalities, including low insulin, hypoglycemia, and premature aging. To investigate mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic phenotypes associated with SIRT6 deficiency, we generated mice carrying targeted disruption of SIRT6. We found that 60% of SIRT6−/− animals had very low levels of blood glucose and died shortly after weaning. The remaining animals, which have relatively higher concentrations of glucose, survived the early post-weaning lethality, but most died within one year of age. Significantly, feeding the mice with glucose-containing water increased blood glucose and rescued 83% of mutant mice, suggesting that the hypoglycemia is a major cause for the lethality. We showed that SIRT6 deficiency results in more abundant membrane association of glucose transporters 1 and 4, which enhances glucose uptake. We further demonstrated that SIRT6 negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 through inhibition of multiple upstream molecules, including insulin receptor, IRS1, and IRS2. The absence of SIRT6, consequently, enhances insulin signaling and activation of AKT, leading to hypoglycemia. These data uncover an essential role of SIRT6 in modulating glucose metabolism through mediating insulin sensitivity. Glucose homeostasis in mammals is mainly regulated by insulin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2005031405,"To date there is no effective therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD). High levels of circulating high density lipoprotein (HDL) and its main protein, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical studies show that plasma HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels are low in patients with AD. To investigate if increasing plasma apoA-I/HDL levels ameliorates AD-like memory deficits and amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, we generated a line of triple transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing mutant forms of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) as well as human apoA-I (AI). Here we show that APP/PS1/AI triple Tg mice have a 2-fold increase of plasma HDL cholesterol levels. When tested in the Morris water maze for spatial orientation abilities, whereas APP/PS1 mice develop age-related learning and memory deficits, APP/PS1/AI mice continue to perform normally during aging. Interestingly, no significant differences were found in the total level and deposition of Aβ in the brains of APP/PS1 and APP/PS1/AI mice, but cerebral amyloid angiopathy was reduced in APP/PS1/AI mice. Also, consistent with the anti-inflammatory properties of apoA-I/HDL, glial activation was reduced in the brain of APP/PS1/AI mice. In addition, Aβ-induced production of proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines was decreased in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures expressing human apoA-I. Therefore, we conclude that overexpression of human apoA-I in the circulation prevents learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice, partly by attenuating neuroinflammation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These findings suggest that elevating plasma apoA-I/HDL levels may be an effective approach to preserve cognitive function in patients with AD."
https://openalex.org/W1981913727,"Using data from the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we show that four regions of the Moon previously described as ""red spots"" exhibit mid-infrared spectra best explained by quartz, silica-rich glass, or alkali feldspar. These lithologies are consistent with evolved rocks similar to lunar granites in the Apollo samples. The spectral character of these spots is distinct from surrounding mare and highlands material and from regions composed of pure plagioclase feldspar. The variety of landforms associated with the silicic spectral character suggests that both extrusive and intrusive silicic magmatism occurred on the Moon. Basaltic underplating is the preferred mechanism for silicic magma generation, leading to the formation of extrusive landforms. This mechanism or silicate liquid immiscibility could lead to the formation of intrusive bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2136312358,"The vast landscape of RNA-protein interactions at the heart of post-transcriptional regulation remains largely unexplored. Indeed it is likely that, even in yeast, a substantial fraction of the regulatory RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain to be discovered. Systematic experimental methods can play a key role in discovering these RBPs - most of the known yeast RBPs lack RNA-binding domains that might enable this activity to be predicted. We describe here a proteome-wide approach to identify RNA-protein interactions based on in vitro binding of RNA samples to yeast protein microarrays that represent over 80% of the yeast proteome. We used this procedure to screen for novel RBPs and RNA-protein interactions. A complementary mass spectrometry technique also identified proteins that associate with yeast mRNAs. Both the protein microarray and mass spectrometry methods successfully identify previously annotated RBPs, suggesting that other proteins identified in these assays might be novel RBPs. Of 35 putative novel RBPs identified by either or both of these methods, 12, including 75% of the eight most highly-ranked candidates, reproducibly associated with specific cellular RNAs. Surprisingly, most of the 12 newly discovered RBPs were enzymes. Functional characteristics of the RNA targets of some of the novel RBPs suggest coordinated post-transcriptional regulation of subunits of protein complexes and a possible link between mRNA trafficking and vesicle transport. Our results suggest that many more RBPs still remain to be identified and provide a set of candidates for further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2009954135,"Our nervous system continuously combines new information from our senses with information it has acquired throughout life. Numerous studies have found that human subjects manage this by integrating their observations with their previous experience (priors) in a way that is close to the statistical optimum. However, little is known about the way the nervous system acquires or learns priors. Here we present results from experiments where the underlying distribution of target locations in an estimation task was switched, manipulating the prior subjects should use. Our experimental design allowed us to measure a subject's evolving prior while they learned. We confirm that through extensive practice subjects learn the correct prior for the task. We found that subjects can rapidly learn the mean of a new prior while the variance is learned more slowly and with a variable learning rate. In addition, we found that a Bayesian inference model could predict the time course of the observed learning while offering an intuitive explanation for the findings. The evidence suggests the nervous system continuously updates its priors to enable efficient behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2076617752,"Many microorganisms excrete typical cytoplasmic proteins into the culture supernatant. As none of the classical secretion systems appears to be involved, this type of secretion was referred to as ""nonclassical protein secretion."" Here, we demonstrate that in Staphylococcus aureus the major autolysin plays a crucial role in release of cytoplasmic proteins. Comparative secretome analysis revealed that in the wild type S. aureus strain, 22 typical cytoplasmic proteins were excreted into the culture supernatant, although in the atl mutant they were significantly decreased. The presence or absence of prophages had little influence on the secretome pattern. In the atl mutant, secondary peptidoglycan hydrolases were increased in the secretome; the corresponding genes were transcriptionally up-regulated suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the atl mutation. Using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a cytoplasmic indicator enzyme, we showed that all clinical isolates tested excreted this protein. In the wall teichoic acid-deficient tagO mutant with its increased autolysis activity, GAPDH was excreted in even higher amounts than in the WT, confirming the importance of autolysis in excretion of cytoplasmic proteins. To answer the question of how discriminatory the excretion of cytoplasmic proteins is, we performed a two-dimensional PAGE of cytoplasmic proteins isolated from WT. Surprisingly, the most abundant proteins in the cytoplasm were not found in the secretome of the WT, suggesting that there exists a selection mechanism in the excretion of cytoplasmic proteins. As the major autolysin binds at the septum site, we assume that the proteins are preferentially released at and during septum formation."
https://openalex.org/W2079319826,"The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 is an immediate-early response gene whose expression is rapidly induced by various extracellular stimuli. The aims of this study were to study the role of Nur77 expression in the growth and survival of colon cancer cells and the mechanism by which Nur77 expression was regulated. We showed that levels of Nur77 were elevated in a majority of human colon tumors (9/12) compared to their nontumorous tissues and that Nur77 expression could be strongly induced by different colonic carcinogens including deoxycholic acid (DCA). DCA-induced Nur77 expression resulted in up-regulation of antiapoptotic BRE and angiogenic VEGF, and it enhanced the growth, colony formation, and migration of colon cancer cells. In studying the mechanism by which Nur77 was regulated in colon cancer cells, we found that β-catenin was involved in induction of Nur77 expression through its activation of the transcriptional activity of AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) that bound to and transactivated the Nur77 promoter. Together, our results demonstrate that Nur77 acts to promote the growth and survival of colon cancer cells and serves as an important mediator of the Wnt/β-catenin and AP-1 signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1984876660,"Survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic infections is based on a genetic adaptation process consisting of mutations in specific genes, which can produce advantageous phenotypic switches and ensure its persistence in the lung. Among these, mutations inactivating the regulators MucA (alginate biosynthesis), LasR (quorum sensing) and MexZ (multidrug-efflux pump MexXY) are the most frequently observed, with those inactivating the DNA mismatch repair system (MRS) being also highly prevalent in P. aeruginosa CF isolates, leading to hypermutator phenotypes that could contribute to this adaptive mutagenesis by virtue of an increased mutation rate. Here, we characterized the mutations found in the mucA, lasR, mexZ and MRS genes in P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from Argentinean CF patients, and analyzed the potential association of mucA, lasR and mexZ mutagenesis with MRS-deficiency and antibiotic resistance. Thus, 38 isolates from 26 chronically infected CF patients were characterized for their phenotypic traits, PFGE genotypic patterns, mutations in the mucA, lasR, mexZ, mutS and mutL gene coding sequences and antibiotic resistance profiles. The most frequently mutated gene was mexZ (79%), followed by mucA (63%) and lasR (39%) as well as a high prevalence (42%) of hypermutators being observed due to loss-of-function mutations in mutL (60%) followed by mutS (40%). Interestingly, mutational spectra were particular to each gene, suggesting that several mechanisms are responsible for mutations during chronic infection. However, no link could be established between hypermutability and mutagenesis in mucA, lasR and mexZ, indicating that MRS-deficiency was not involved in the acquisition of these mutations. Finally, although inactivation of mucA, lasR and mexZ has been previously shown to confer resistance/tolerance to antibiotics, only mutations in MRS genes could be related to an antibiotic resistance increase. These results help to unravel the mutational dynamics that lead to the adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the CF lung."
https://openalex.org/W2042717507,"S100B, established as prevalent protein of the central nervous system, is a peripheral biomarker for blood-brain barrier disruption and often also a marker of brain injury. However, reports of extracranial sources of S100B, especially from adipose tissue, may confound its interpretation in the clinical setting. The objective of this study was to characterize the tissue specificity of S100B and assess how extracranial sources of S100B affect serum levels. The extracranial sources of S100B were determined by analyzing nine different types of human tissues by ELISA and Western blot. In addition, brain and adipose tissue were further analyzed by mass spectrometry. A study of 200 subjects was undertaken to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and S100B serum levels. We also measured the levels of S100B homo- and heterodimers in serum quantitatively after blood-brain barrier disruption. Analysis of human tissues by ELISA and Western blot revealed variable levels of S100B expression. By ELISA, brain tissue expressed the highest S100B levels. Similarly, Western blot measurements revealed that brain tissue expressed high levels of S100B but comparable levels were found in skeletal muscle. Mass spectrometry of brain and adipose tissue confirmed the presence of S100B but also revealed the presence of S100A1. The analysis of 200 subjects revealed no statistically significant relationship between BMI and S100B levels. The main species of S100B released from the brain was the B-B homodimer. Our results show that extracranial sources of S100B do not affect serum levels. Thus, the diagnostic value of S100B and its negative predictive value in neurological diseases in intact subjects (without traumatic brain or bodily injury from accident or surgery) are not compromised in the clinical setting."

Related regional increases in a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and AOD imply that direct and indirect aerosol radiative effects are coupled issues linked globally to aged combustion.

Although the concept of an integrated signaling network replete with interpathway cross-talk and feedback regulation is broadly appreciated, kinetic data of the type needed to characterize such interactions in conjunction with mathematical models are lacking. In mammalian cells, the Ras/ERK pathway controls cell proliferation and other responses stimulated by growth factors, and several cross-talk and feedback mechanisms affecting its activation have been identified. In this work, we take a systematic approach to parse the magnitudes of multiple regulatory mechanisms that attenuate ERK activation through canonical (Ras-dependent) and non-canonical (PI3K-dependent) pathways. In addition to regulation of receptor and ligand levels, we consider three layers of ERK-dependent feedback: desensitization of Ras activation, negative regulation of MEK kinase (e.g. Raf) activities, and up-regulation of dual-specificity ERK phosphatases. Our results establish the second of these as the dominant mode of ERK self-regulation in mouse fibroblasts.

Mammalian cells recognize and respond to chemical stimuli through ligation of specific receptors at the cell surface, which in turn activate highly conserved intracellular signal transduction pathways. These pathways elicit growth and proliferation, polarization and migration, differentiation, and other responses by actuating cell gene-regulatory and cytoskeletal systems. Obviously, signal transduction must be tightly regulated, as spurious intracellular signaling is associated with autonomous cell proliferation, invasive cell migration, and other molecular signatures of cancer progression (1Condeelis J.

J. 2006; 393: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we showed that PDGF-stimulated ERK activation requires signaling through either of two pathways: the canonical, Ras-dependent pathway or PI3K-dependent cross-talk. PI3K-dependent signaling positively modulates the ERK pathway, while the PI3K pathway is not significantly affected by endogenous Ras signaling. Through quantitative analysis of a coarse-grained kinetic model, we estimated that the magnitudes of the Ras- and PI3K-dependent contributions to MEK/ERK activation are comparable; the PI3K-dependent pathway was found to be only moderately more potent (1.6:1 ratio), once negative feedback desensitization of Ras-GTP loading was taken into account (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

Our analysis shows that the second of these, directly affecting MEK phosphorylation, is in fact the dominant layer of ERK self-regulation in our cells, accounting for >90% of the signal attenuation. We additionally found significant depletion of growth factor from the extracellular medium, which affects signaling at subsaturating growth factor concentrations. Support for the refined mathematical model, trained by alignment to the superset of old and new data (>300 distinct experimental measurements), is demonstrated through its ability to quantitatively predict the enhancement of PDGF-stimulated MEK phosphorylation in cells with both ERK1 and ERK2 expression knocked down. A more surprising model prediction, also confirmed experimentally, is a lack of effect of MKP3/DUSP6 knockdown on ERK phosphorylation. guanine nucleotide exchange factor mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase dual specificity phosphatase. All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Human recombinant PDGF-BB was from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies against total ERK1/2 and MKP3 and phosphospecific antibodies against Akt pSer473, ERK pThr202/pTyr204, MEK pSer217/pSer221, and Raf-1 pSer289/pSer296/pSer301 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); antibodies against total Akt1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human PDGF-BB ELISA kit, with PDGF β-receptor/Fc chimera as the capture reagent, was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Pharmacological inhibitors were from CalBiochem or, in the case of MG-132, Sigma-Aldrich; where applicable, cells were pre-incubated with the inhibitor for 30–60 min prior to PDGF stimulation. The siGENOME siRNA reagents and siGENOME SMARTpool siRNAs against mouse MKP3 (GeneID: 67603), ERK1 (GeneID: 26417), and ERK2 (GeneID: 26413) and siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA Pool #2 were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Unless otherwise noted, all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin. Where applicable, NIH 3T3 cells were serially infected with retrovirus bearing empty vector or S17N H-Ras and selected using puromycin prior to each experiment, as described previously (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Kaur H. Park C.S. Lewis J.M. Haugh J.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with siRNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol and incubated for 3 days prior to the experiment. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to stimulation. Detergent lysates were prepared for quantitative immunoblotting, and immunoblots were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence, as described previously (17Park C.S. Schneider I.C. Haugh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37064-37072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Blots comparing lysates prepared on the same day, representing either different inhibitor treatments or different cell variants and respective control conditions, were performed in parallel and exposed at the same time. The Bio-Rad Fluor S-Max system, which gives a linear response with respect to light output, was used, and band intensity was quantified using local background subtraction. Immunoblot data were first normalized by an appropriate loading control and then further normalized to evaluate the consistency of relative trends across independent experiments, based on the 1 nm time course for the control condition, as described in detail previously (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The refined mathematical model of the PDGF receptor network is illustrated conceptually in Fig. 1B and described in detail in supplemental Text S1. PDGF receptor binding, dimerization, and endocytosis, and the production of 3′ phosphoinositides by receptor-recruited PI3K, are modeled essentially as described previously (17Park C.S. Schneider I.C. Haugh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37064-37072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Schneider I.C. Haugh J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This portion of the model was supplemented with a differential equation accounting for depletion of PDGF-BB from the extracellular medium. Our previous coarse-grained model of Ras- and PI3K-dependent MEK kinase/MEK/ERK activation and regulation (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was supplemented with ERK-dependent negative feedbacks affecting the MEK kinase activities and ERK-dependent regulation of MKP3 expression. It also allows that MKP1, MKP3, and/or a constitutive level of dual-specificity phosphatase activity contribute(s) to the dephosphorylation of ERK. Other phosphatases, such as those acting on phosphorylated MEK and MEK kinases, appear in the model with constant activities assumed. The parameter estimation approach used is related to the algorithm described previously (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with certain modifications as described in detail in supplemental Text S1; both are Monte Carlo-based and generate a large (n = 10,000) ensemble of “good” parameter sets (supplemental Table S1) rather than one “best” fit, but here a modified simulated annealing protocol was designed. After acquiring the ensemble, the model output is recalculated for each parameter set, and at each time point, an ensemble mean and standard deviation are calculated. We first show that MEK phosphorylation is regulated in a manner that cannot be explained by feedback loops impinging upstream of Ras or at the level of ERK phosphatases. Whereas our previous model was constrained by quantitative measurements of Ras-GTP loading and ERK phosphorylation, measurements of MEK phosphorylation kinetics in the same cell backgrounds provide critical data and mechanistic insights about the regulation of the pathway (Fig. 2). Referring to the diagrams in Fig. 1, it is clear why: the activation of both MEK and ERK reflect the integration of Ras- and PI3K-dependent inputs to the pathway, but unlike ERK, MEK is not directly affected by modulation of MKP/DUSP levels. Samples were obtained from among the same NIH 3T3 cell lysates used previously to quantify ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Systematic quantification of Ras- and PI3K-dependent contributions to MEK activation was achieved through inhibition of PI3K and Ras, by incubation with LY294002 compound and expression of dominant-negative (S17N) H-Ras, respectively. The results show that PDGF-stimulated MEK phosphorylation is generally transient and sensitive to ablation of either Ras (emphasizing the PI3K-dependent pathway; Fig. 2A) or PI3K (emphasizing the Ras-dependent pathway; Fig. 2B) signaling. Conceptually, the transience of MEK phosphorylation might seem to be consistent with the previously reported ERK phosphorylation kinetics (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar); however, our previous model, using parameter values fit without the benefit of MEK data, predicts sustained MEK phosphorylation with only a small overshoot (supplemental Fig. S1). Indeed, the previous scheme cannot possibly explain how MEK phosphorylation is transient in Ras-inhibited cells stimulated with a high dose of PDGF; in the previous model, partial adaptation of ERK phosphorylation under those conditions had been solely attributed to up-regulation of MKP activity, downstream of MEK. The new results identify desensitization of MEK phosphorylation, downstream of Ras and PI3K, as an important regulatory mechanism in the ERK signaling network. We next present evidence that feedback at the level of modulating two DUSP isoforms, MKP1/DUSP1 and MKP3/DUSP6, does not significantly impact ERK phosphorylation kinetics. We showed previously that high doses of PDGF elicit 3–5-fold up-regulation of MKP1 in our cells (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the context of the previous model, this negative feedback loop was important for explaining partial adaptation of the ERK phosphorylation response, especially as activated by the PI3K-dependent pathway as explained above; although the potential importance of ERK-MKP feedback has also been emphasized in a number of mathematical models of ERK signaling, it must be acknowledged that expression of MKP1 in particular might not be a quantitative indicator of ERK dephosphorylation. Indeed, other DUSP isoforms, especially MKP3, are thought to be more important in that regard (37Owens D.M. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3203-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and we found that MKP3 and MKP1 expression levels are modulated quite differently in our cells. Whereas MKP1 expression increases sharply (after a time lag) and plateaus in response to high PDGF doses (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), MKP3 expression rapidly decays and then recovers, as quantified in Fig. 3, A and B. These kinetics are consistent with ERK-dependent modulation of both synthesis and degradation of MKP3 (38Jurek A. Amagasaki K. Gembarska A. Heldin C.H. Lennartsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4626-4634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite the complex regulation of these two DUSPs, we found that ERK phosphorylation is not sensitive to changes in either of their endogenous expression levels. Reduction of MKP3 expression by RNA interference (≈60–70% knockdown) had no significant effect on the kinetics or dose responsiveness of PDGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation, as compared with cells treated with a scrambled oligonucleotide control (Fig. 3C); these results stand in contrast with published data using porcine aortic endothelial cells with heterologous expression of PDGF receptors (38Jurek A. Amagasaki K. Gembarska A. Heldin C.H. Lennartsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4626-4634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expectation that ERK phosphorylation might be negatively correlated with changes in MKP1 expression does not hold in cells treated with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor that amplifies MKP1 up-regulation, or SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity that has the opposite effect (supplemental Fig. S2). Although these results do not rule out the possibility that ERK phosphorylation is shaped by feedback regulation of other DUSP isoforms, they do further suggest that the primary determinant of ERK adaptation in this system is the transience of MEK activation. Indeed, using our refined mathematical model, we will show that this sufficiently and quantitatively explains the kinetics of the ERK network under all conditions tested. To round out the data needed to accurately quantify the mechanisms that contribute to adaptation of signaling, we sought to ensure that dynamics affecting PDGF receptor activation were sufficiently characterized. Because our previous framework already accounted for endocytosis as a mechanism for PDGF receptor down-regulation (17Park C.S. Schneider I.C. Haugh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37064-37072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Kaur H. Park C.S. Lewis J.M. Haugh J.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we speculated that depletion of PDGF from the external medium might significantly temper prolonged responses to low PDGF doses (Fig. 4). To evaluate the significance of PDGF depletion, we measured time courses of PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation for low (30 pm) and high (1 nm) doses of PDGF-BB, and prior to the final time point of 75 min, the medium was aspirated (at 60 min) and replaced with the same initial PDGF concentration. The results confirm that the Akt phosphorylation level recovers substantially (by roughly 2-fold) once the low PDGF dose is replenished (Fig. 4A). As expected, this is not true of the high PDGF dose, because the PI3K/Akt pathway is maximally activated (saturated) as long as the external PDGF concentration exceeds roughly 0.5 nm (17Park C.S. Schneider I.C. Haugh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37064-37072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The kinetics of PDGF-BB depletion were directly quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 4B). The results show that, for initial doses ranging from 0.03–1 nm, the extent of depletion over 2 h is 40–50%. To demonstrate the consistency of these data with those of PDGF-stimulated Akt phosphorylation reported previously (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we achieved a satisfactory global fit of both data types to a minimal submodel of the pathway kinetics (Fig. 4, B and C). The two types of experiments were performed using roughly the same cell densities and the same volume of medium, and the fit to the data were highly constrained, as only 5 of the submodel parameters were adjusted (see supplemental Text S1 for details). The current model is illustrated conceptually in Fig. 1B and described in detail in supplemental Text S1. It has a total of 22 state variables and 57 adjustable rate parameters; of the parameters, 14 are fixed at constant values, based on previous work and the constrained fit to the ligand depletion and Akt phosphorylation data described in the previous section. The remaining 43 parameters were estimated by direct and global alignment with the rest of the data, which included the kinetics of Ras-GTP loading, ERK phosphorylation, and MKP1 levels reported previously (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the newly acquired MEK phosphorylation and MKP3 expression data. Thus, whereas our previous analysis required fewer fit parameters, the present analysis further constrains the model fit with a disproportionately higher number of readouts and nearly double the number of data points for comparison (Table 1). As in our previous work, the approach is not designed to identify a single set of “best” parameter values but rather a large ensemble (n = 10,000) of parameter sets that perform almost equally well in fitting the data. Analysis of those parameter sets (supplemental Table S1) indicates which parameters are constrained well by the data and which are less so.TABLE 1Comparison of the current and previous PDGF receptor signaling network modelsThis workWang et al.

Unlike the previous version, the current model accurately captures the newly quantified MEK phosphorylation kinetics, and it outperforms the previous version in fitting ERK phosphorylation kinetics (Table 1). Notably, the current model properly “spreads” the peak ERK phosphorylation levels for the four PDGF doses, and it captures the ERK phosphorylation kinetics of the S17N Ras, 30 pm PDGF time course that was missed by the previous model (15Wang C.C. Cirit M. Haugh J.M. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5 (article no. 246)Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Among the insights that we can glean directly from the parameter statistics, relevant to feedback regulation of the network, is the tendency of the fit to marginalize the contributions of both MKP1 and MKP3 (parameters β1 and β3), in relation to a third, time-invariant ERK phosphatase activity. This is a bona fide model prediction, because the experimental data showing the same were not used to constrain the model. Quantitatively, the model accurately predicts the results of the MKP3 knockdown experiment shown in Fig. 3C (supplemental Fig. S4). The lack of sensitivity of ERK phosphorylation to MKP1 and MKP3 dynamics, which are characterized by 11 of the 43 global fit parameters in the current model, together with considerations of fast reactions and enzymatic reactions or complexes operating far from saturation (supplemental Table S1), indicate that the model can be simplified without significantly affecting predictions about ERK signaling. It is conservatively estimated that less than half of the parameters are needed to achieve essentially the same fit of the Ras, MEK, and ERK data.

Recently, short, noncoding, microRNAs have been identified as key regulators of lymphocyte function; however, it is unknown whether glucocorticoids regulate noncoding microRNAs and whether this regulation contributes to lymphocyte apoptosis. We now show by both microarray and deep sequencing analysis that microRNAs are substantially repressed during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of primary rat thymocytes.

Recently, noncoding microRNAs have emerged as important gene expression regulatory elements. Transcribed by RNA polymerase II, microRNA precursors undergo extensive post-transcriptional processing by the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha and its co-factor DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8)/Pasha followed by Ran-GTP/Exportin-5-dependent nuclear export. In the cytoplasm, primary microRNAs are further cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer to yield a microRNA duplex. The biologically active, mature, single-stranded microRNA is then incorporated into the microRNA-induced silencing complex. The microRNA-bearing microRNA-induced silencing complex proceeds to affect gene expression through the inhibitory engagement of complimentary “seed sequences” within the 3′-UTRs of target mRNAs, resulting in translational inhibition (1Kim V.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar, 2Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 861-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Through the modulation of gene expression, microRNAs are key effectors of fundamental biological processes including development, differentiation, and apoptosis (3Esquela-Kerscher A. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (6202) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of lymphocytes is a highly coordinated process governing the development of the T-cell repertoire during thymocyte selection as well as the emergence of lymphoproliferative disease caused by the escape of malignant cells from apoptotic constraint. Recently, microRNAs have been implicated in both the regulation of lymphocyte apoptosis and the development of hematomalignancy. For example, hsa-miR-15 and -16 are strongly down-regulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the expression of the anti-apoptotic oncogene Bcl-2 is inversely correlated with the expression of these microRNAs (4Calin G.A.

Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-15 and -16 in a leukemic cell line resulted in the reduced expression of Bcl-2 and the induction of apoptosis, suggesting a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor function for microRNAs 15 and 16 in human lymphocytes (6Cimmino A.

These lymphomas exhibited resistance to apoptosis and increased proliferation (7He L. Thomson J.M. Hemann M.T. Hernando-Monge E. Mu D. Goodson S. Powers S. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Hannon G.J. Hammond S.M. Nature. 2005; 435: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of the entire hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron in the murine hematopoietic compartment led to the development of lymphoproliferative disease and increased lethality. Lymphocytes derived from these animals displayed reduced sensitivity to Fas ligand-induced cell death as well as increased proliferation (8Xiao C. Srinivasan L. Calado D.P. Patterson H.C. Zhang B. Wang J. Henderson J.M. Kutok J.L. Rajewsky K. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Finally, the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bim 2The abbreviations used are: BimBcl-2 interacting mediator of cell deathGRglucocorticoid receptormiRNAmicroRNA. and phosphatase and tensin homolog, was decreased in response to hsa-miR-17–92 overexpression, suggesting a conserved, anti-apoptotic function for the miR-17–92 polycistron in lymphocytes. Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death glucocorticoid receptor microRNA. Glucocorticoids are key effectors of lymphocyte development through the induction of apoptosis and the mutual antagonism of T-cell receptor activation-induced apoptosis during thymocyte selection (9Ashwell J.D. Lu F.W. Vacchio M.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Because of their ability to induce rapid apoptosis of lymphocytes, synthetic glucocorticoids are also critical components of hematomalignant chemotherapy regimens. Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes is a multifaceted process, requiring signaling through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the subsequent transactivation of apoptotic effector genes (10Cifone M.G. Migliorati G. Parroni R. Marchetti C. Millimaggi D. Santoni A. Riccardi C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2282-2296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mann C.L. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A.

The requirement for de novo transcriptional events in the execution of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is well established. However, it is not clear whether the expression of microRNAs is altered during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes and, if so, whether such alterations contribute to the cell death process. Here, we provide evidence of prevalent post-transcriptional repression of microRNA expression during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of primary rat thymocytes and further demonstrate the repression of the microRNA bioprocessors, Dicer, Drosha, and DGCR8/Pasha. Additionally, the stable depletion of Dicer in glucocorticoid-sensitive leukemic cell lines significantly enhanced glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and overexpression of the glucocorticoid-repressed hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron-blunted glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, indicating that the repression of microRNA expression and processing contributes to the progression of glucocorticoid-induced lymphocyte apoptosis. Rat primary thymoyctes were isolated from adrenalectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats (60–75 g) ∼1–2 weeks after surgery. Following decapitation, the thymi of three animals were removed and pooled in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 75 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Thymi were gently sheared with surgical scissors at room temperature. Sheared cells were filtered through 200-micron nylon mesh twice and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was then resuspended in fresh media and filtered into a sterile conical tube. The cells were cultured at a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Primary thymocytes were isolated from adrenalectomized male B57BL/6 wild-type control or hsa-miR-17–92 transgenic mice at 20 weeks of age. Following cervical dislocation, individual thymi were removed and gently sheared to dissociate free thymocytes. Sheared cells were filtered through 200-micron nylon mesh twice and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was then resuspended in fresh medium and filtered into a sterile conical tube. The cells were cultured at a final concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The Jurkat GRα cell line was kindly generated by Dr. Nick Lu in our laboratory. Briefly, parental Jurkat cells were transfected with pTRE hGRα vector (14Lu N.Z. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) using the Lonza Nucelofector System (Basel, Switzerland). Stably overexpressing clones were established by hygromycin/G418 selective pressure (200 μg/ml). CEM-C7 leukemic cells were obtained from Dr. Carl Bortner. For all experiments, Jurkat GRα and CEM-C7 cells were cultured at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 75 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. CEM-C7 and Jurkat GRα cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding Dicer shRNA or nontargeting control at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Stable Dicer depleted cells were established by puromycin selection (2 μg/ml). Anti-Dicer and nontargeting control Mission shRNAs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Jurkat GRα cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding hsa-miR-17–92 pre-miRNA or empty vector control at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Transduction at this multiplicity of infection resulted in a transduction efficiency of >90% as determined by CopGFP expression. Lenti-miR hsa-miR-17–92 precursor and empty vector clones were purchased from System Biosciences (Mountain View, CA). All of the lentiviruses were packaged in HEK293T cells according to established protocols (15Salmon P. Trono D. Current Protocol in Human Genetics. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ2007Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pMD2G, psPAX2, and transfer vector containing the desired gene or miRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. Supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection and concentrated by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 2 h. The pellets were resuspended in PBS and used for infection. All of the titers were determined by quantitative PCR analysis of lentiviral integration into the host genome. In addition, titration of viruses co-expressing fluorescent moieties was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Rat primary thymocytes were isolated and cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm dexamethasone for 6 h. Following treatment, total RNA was isolated from untreated control and dexamethasone-treated samples and subjected to microarray analysis using Agilent rat miRNA V2 (design identification 019159) 8 × 15 multiplex format arrays (Agilent Technologies) following the Agilent one-color miRNA complete labeling and hybridization kit protocol. Starting with 70–100 ng of total RNA, the cytidine bisphosphate reagent was used to selectively label mature miRNAs according to manufacturer's protocol. In combination with the miRNA microarray probe design, the cytidine bisphosphate reagent ensures detection of both low abundance and highly homologous miRNAs. Each labeled sample was hybridized for 20 h in a rotating hybridization oven. The slides were washed and then scanned with an Agilent scanner. The data were obtained using the Agilent feature extraction software (v9.5), using the miRNA defaults for all parameters. The Agilent feature extraction software performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise. The resulting data were processed using the Rosetta Resolver® system (version 7.2) (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA). Error-weighted ratios and the associated p values were generated by Resolver to identify differentially expressed probes. A p value of <0.05 was used to generate gene lists of differentially expressed microRNAs. Rat primary thymocytes were isolated and cultured in the presence of absence of 100 nm dexamethasone for 6 h. Following treatment, total RNA was isolated from untreated control and dexamethasone-treated samples and subjected to microRNA deep sequencing. Small RNA cDNA libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (small RNA sample prep kit, oligonucleotide only, protocol 71003; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Small RNA cDNA libraries were then sequenced according to the manufacturer's instructions on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Reads were aligned to the reference rat genome (2004 assembly) using Bowtie (16Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25-R34Crossref PubMed Scopus (15102) Google Scholar). Given that mature microRNAs are usually ∼18–20 nucleotides in length, we used the first 20 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the read sequence for the alignment (to avoid the adapter sequence that may be present in the read sequence). We allowed up to two mismatches and up to three alignments of same quality per read sequence. Reads that aligned at more than three unique genomic locations were removed from further analysis to avoid repetitive elements. Fold changes were calculated as a ratio of total number of reads in the control divided by the total number of reads in dexamethasone treatment, as implemented in Erange (17Mortazavi A. Williams B.A. McCue K. Schaeffer L. Wold B. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar) for sites that contained at least 20 aligned reads in either of the two samples. Sites that were within 100 bp of a previously annotated microRNA and displayed fold change of 2.0 or greater in either direction were selected for detailed analyses. Total RNAs were isolated using the Ambion mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Austin, TX). For mature microRNA and primary microRNA analysis, total RNAs were reverse transcribed using the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit and analyzed using TaqMan mature microRNA and primary microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). For gene expression analysis, total RNAs were reverse transcribed using the TaqMan reverse transcription kit and analyzed with TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). All of the quantitative PCRs were performed on a 7900HT quantitative PCR platform (Applied Biosystems). The cells were harvested and lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad). Whole cell lysates (20–30 μg) were fractionated on 6% or 8% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed overnight with the following antibodies: Dicer rabbit polyclonal, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); Drosha rabbit polyclonal, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); DGCR8/Pasha goat polyclonal, 1:1000 (Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan); and β-actin, 1:10,000 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Apoptosis was evaluated via annexin V/propidium iodide staining or propidium iodide staining alone. For annexin V analysis, the cells were stained with annexin V according to the manufacturer's protocol and counterstained with propidium iodide (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Caspase-3 activation was monitored via CaspaTag fluorescence, and the cells were stained according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). For propidium iodide staining alone, propidium iodide (Invitrogen) was added to achieve a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Following staining, the cells were immediately analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSort cytometer equipped with CellQuest software. Adrenalectomized hsa-miR-17–92 transgenic mice or C57BL/6 wild-type controls were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME). Adrenalectomized rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All of the experiments were performed in accordance with the NIEHS, National Institutes of Health Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For these studies, primary rat thymocytes, a classic model of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone for 6 h. Apoptotic progression was monitored in control and glucocorticoid-treated cells via flow cytometric analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure, plasma membrane integrity, and caspase-3 activation. Following 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment, we observed an apoptotic population of cells. These cells exhibited phosphatidylserine externalization as determined by a significant increase in annexin-FITC fluorescence and decreased plasma membrane integrity demonstrated by a modest increase in propidium iodide fluorescence (Fig. 1A). These cells also exhibited an increase in caspase-3 activity determined by an increase in CaspaTag fluorescence, indicating the clear induction of apoptosis following 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment (Fig. 1B). These apoptotic indicators persisted following 12 h of treatment, resulting in significant cell death (Fig. 1). Therefore, we performed our microRNA expression analysis early in the apoptotic process (prior to cell death) after 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment. Following 6 h of treatment, total RNAs from control and glucocorticoid-treated cells were prepared and subjected to microRNA microarray analysis. Of the 350 microRNAs represented on our chip, 56 were differentially expressed in response to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the majority of these microRNAs (79% or 44 microRNAs) were repressed, and only 12 low abundance microRNAs were weakly induced during this time frame. Given the low basal expression levels of these induced microRNAs, we were unable to confirm their up-regulation via quantitative PCR. Because microRNA expression levels can vary widely, we focused our efforts on the abundantly expressed and thus potentially biologically active microRNAs (basal intensity values >200). The percent repression values (intensity glucocorticoid/intensity control) were generated for these microRNAs (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, these abundantly expressed microRNAs were repressed uniformly irrespective of their genomic locations, suggesting that the repression of microRNA expression during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis occurs post-transcriptionally, perhaps at the level of bioprocessing. The repression of a subset of microRNAs identified as differentially expressed (rno-let-7a, rno-miR-15b, and rno-miR-25) as well as the repression of a microRNA not significantly regulated in the microarray (rno-miR-17) was validated via quantitative PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the expression of rno-miR-17 and rno-let-7a primary transcripts was increased during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, providing important evidence that the repression of the resultant mature microRNAs occurs post-transcriptionally (Fig. 2D). To evaluate the expression of the microRNAnome during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis by an alternative approach, we performed next generation sequencing or deep sequencing of microRNAs from the control and glucocorticoid-treated samples. These samples were obtained from independent animals rather than those described in Fig. 2; however, these cells exhibited apoptotic kinetics similar to those described in Fig. 1. Deep sequencing of microRNAs is an open-ended and hybridization-independent approach that facilitates the detection of both annotated and novel microRNAs. In our study, massively parallel sequencing of control and glucocorticoid-treated RNA samples generated millions of short sequences (commonly referred to as “reads”), which were aligned to the reference rat genome (Fig. 3A). We identified a set of 1782 sites (genomic loci that may be encoding microRNAs) that were down-regulated and 238 sites that were up-regulated by glucocorticoid treatment (see “Experimental Procedures” for more details). Of the 1782 sites, 132 sites were within 100 bp of an annotated microRNA, which correspond to 129 individual microRNAs (supplemental Table S1). It is also possible that the sites not immediately adjacent to a known microRNA may house novel microRNAs, which warrants further evaluation. Similar to the aforementioned microarray study, we detected a number of sites that were up-regulated by dexamethasone treatment; however, none of the 238 up-regulated sites were in close proximity to an annotated microRNA (Fig. 3B). These results obtained by deep sequencing mirror the microarray findings of prevalent microRNA repression and minimal microRNA induction during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of primary thymocytes. In addition, the percent repression values of abundantly expressed microRNAs generated using deep sequencing data were comparable with those generated using microarray data, further suggesting the post-transcriptional repression of microRNAs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes (Fig. 3C). Deep sequencing analysis confirmed the repression of 35 of the 44 microRNAs repressed in the microarray analysis (79%). Moreover, microRNA deep sequencing was also able to detect repressed microRNAs not detected by microarray (representative values in gray in Fig. 3C), suggesting that deep sequencing of microRNAs is a more sensitive technique that may be used in conjunction with microRNA microarray and quantitative PCR as a novel “weight of evidence” approach to comprehensive profiling of the microRNAnome. The broad, genome-wide down-regulation of microRNA expression detected by both microarray and deep sequencing analysis and the absence of primary microRNA transcript repression suggest post-transcriptional repression of mature microRNAs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the key microRNA processing enzymes Drosha, DGCR8/Pasha, and Dicer during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of primary thymocytes. Following 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment, the mRNA expression of each processor is repressed, with the repression of Dicer and DGCR8/Pasha mRNA achieving statistical significance (Fig. 4A). After 12 h of treatment, the mRNA levels of each processor are significantly repressed in response to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). The reduced expression of microRNA processing enzymes is not due to an apoptosis-related global increase in RNase activity because the expression of the glucocorticoid-responsive genes Gelsolin and Bim are strongly induced under these conditions in our cells (Fig. 4C). The repression of microRNA processing enzymes was also evident at the level of protein expression (Fig. 4B). Drosha protein expression was decreased following 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment and was essentially undetectable at 12 h. The expression of Drosha's co-factor DGCR8/Pasha was also reduced in response to glucocorticoid treatment and upon overexposure, a clear cleavage pattern emerged following 12 h of treatment. Furthermore, the protein expression of the cytoplasmic processor, Dicer, was also markedly reduced following 6 h of glucocorticoid treatment, whereas at 12 h full-length Dicer was barely detectable (Fig. 4C). This repression of the microRNA bioprocessing pathway results in the nuclear accumulation of unprocessed primary microRNAs (supplemental Fig. S1), accounting for the increased expression of microRNA primary transcripts observed during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). To assess whether the repression of microRNA expression contributes to the cell death process, we silenced the expression of Dicer, the enzyme responsible for mature microRNA biosynthesis, in two human lymphoid cell lines. The transition to cultured cell lines was necessary because primary rat thymocytes are difficult to genetically manipulate in vitro. Therefore, we performed our functional analyses in the Jurkat GRα and the CEM-C7 leukemic cell lines. The Jurkat GRα cell line was generated by the exogenous expression of the full-length GRα isoform in the glucocorticoid-resistant Jurkat ALL parental cell line (18Riml S. Schmidt S. Ausserlechner M.J. Geley S. Kofler R. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: S65-S72Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and stable expression of GRα restores glucocorticoid sensitivity to Jurkat cells (Fig. 5A). The glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM-C7 cell line contains an endogenous, hormone-responsive GRα and exhibits slower apoptotic kinetics in response to glucocorticoid compared with the Jurkat GRα cell line (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, similar to the results obtained in primary cell culture, Dicer expression is repressed at both the mRNA and protein levels in each leukemic cell line during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Stable Dicer depletion in these cells was achieved via lentiviral transduction of shRNA (Fig. 5C), and the depletion of Dicer resulted in the reduced expression of a subset of microRNAs (Fig. 5D). Dicer depletion and the subsequent repression of microRNA expression augmented glucocorticoid induced apoptosis in both cell lines as determined by flow cytometric evaluation of phosphatidylserine exposure and plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 5E). Importantly, this increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis was not due to increased GR expression in the absence of Dicer expression (data not shown). These data suggest that Dicer depletion and subsequent microRNA repression enhance the progression of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes. To delineate the potential role of specific microRNAs down-regulated during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, we sought to overexpress the anti-apoptotic miR-17–92 polycistron. Members of this polycistron were repressed by glucocorticoid treatment in primary thymocytes, as determined by both the microarray and deep sequencing studies. Furthermore, mature members of this polycistron are also down-regulated during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of cultured leukemic cells (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of the hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron via lentiviral transduction of hsa-miR-17–92 precursor microRNA resulted in efficient overexpression of individual mature hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron members in the Jurkat GRα cell line (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron members in the Jurkat GRα background significantly diminished the ability of both subsaturating and saturating doses of glucocorticoid to induce glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C). This diminished sensitivity was not due to decreased GR expression in response to hsa-miR-17–92 overexpression (data not shown). In addition, primary thymocytes derived from mice transgenic for the hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron (∼1.5–2-fold overexpression of mature hsa-miR-17–92 polycistron members (8Xiao C. Srinivasan L.

In neurons, the Hsp70s and their Hsp40-like J-domain co-chaperones are the only known components of chaperone network that can use ATP to convert cytotoxic protein aggregates into harmless natively refolded polypeptides. Here we developed a protocol for preparing a homogeneous population of highly stable β-sheet enriched toroid-shaped α-Syn oligomers with a diameter typical of toxic pore-forming oligomers. These oligomers were partially resistant to in vitro unfolding by the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE). Moreover, both bacterial and human Hsp70/Hsp40 unfolding/refolding activities of model chaperone substrates were strongly inhibited by the oligomers but, remarkably, not by unstructured α-Syn monomers even in large excess. The oligomers acted as a specific competitive inhibitor of the J-domain co-chaperones, indicating that J-domain co-chaperones may preferably bind to exposed bulky misfolded structures in misfolded proteins and, thus, complement Hsp70s that bind to extended segments. Together, our findings suggest that inhibition of the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone system by α-Syn oligomers may contribute to the disruption of protein homeostasis in dopaminergic neurons, leading to apoptosis and tissue loss in Parkinson disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. α-Synuclein aggregation and accumulation in Lewy bodies are implicated in progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease and related disorders.

Under ideal in vitro conditions, such as low protein concentrations and low temperatures, the primary amino acid sequence may suffice to dictate the spontaneous folding of polypeptides into discrete three-dimensional, active structures called the native state (2Anfinsen C.B.

PD is characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of human brain alongside with the presence of cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs). LBs are proteinaceous inclusions mainly composed of aggregates and insoluble fibrillar α-Syn (6Mezey E. Dehejia A.M. Harta G. Tresser N. Suchy S.F. Nussbaum R.L. Brownstein M.J. Polymeropoulos M.H. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) associated with different members of the protein homeostasis machinery. LBs and other types of α-Syn inclusions are also found in cases of dementia in some types of Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, and several other neurological diseases, collectively denominated synucleinopathies (for review, see Ref. 7Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). α-Syn is a 14.5-kDa protein mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system of vertebrates, from torpedo fish to humans (8Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In humans, it is expressed mostly in presynaptic terminals (9Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), astrocytic and oligodendroglial cells (10Wakabayashi K. Hayashi S. Yoshimoto M. Kudo H. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 99: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, native soluble α-Syn is involved in the differentiation of dopaminergic cells, where it functions as an activity-dependent negative regulator of dopamine neurotransmission (for review, see Ref. 11Tofaris G.K. Spillantini M.G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2194-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because in the purified state, human α-Syn is a monomer apparently devoid of stable secondary structures, it has been described as “natively” unfolded or intrinsically unstructured (12Weinreb P.H.

Dyn. 2003; 21: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Yet, in the membrane-rich crowded environment of the cell, α-Syn may become structured and upon binding to membranes is thought to adopt partially an α-helical conformation (14Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). During PD pathogenesis or aging, loose α-helical or natively unfolded α-Syn monomers may spontaneously convert, by a mechanism still unclear, into highly stable β-sheet-enriched oligomers, some of which protofibrils (15Goldberg M.S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E115-E119Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) that can ultimately form more compact, protease-resistant and apparently less toxic fibrils in LBs (for review, see Ref. 16Volles M.J.

Three specific point mutations in α-Syn have been linked to autosomal dominant inherited forms of PD and correlate with early onset of the disease (17Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E.

Interestingly, all three also accelerate the in vitro oligomerization and fibril formation of α-Syn and promote the spontaneous formation of toxic oligomers, including amyloid pores (20Lashuel H.A.

There is strong evidence that the soluble, low molecular weight forms of β-sheet-enriched oligomers are the primary toxic species in the disease (21Volles M.J. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4595-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), whereas fibril formation is already part of a detoxification mechanism whereby toxic oligomers become sequestered and, thus, incapacitated at participating in aberrant interactions with membranes and other proteins of the cell (for review, see Ref. 1Muchowski P.J. Neuron. 2002; 35: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In solution and at high concentrations (>200 μm), α-Syn spontaneously forms annular pore-like structures (20Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol.

Matsuzaki-Kobayashi M. Hasegawa T. Kikuchi A. Sugeno N. Itoyama Y. Wang Y. Yao P.J. Bushlin I. Takeda A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here, we developed a reproducible protocol for preparing and purifying a homogeneous population of highly stable β-sheet enriched, toroid-shaped α-Syn oligomers with a diameter typical of toxic protofibrils. We then compared the effect of purified native monomeric α-Syn to that of the purified oligomers on the in vitro ATP-dependent chaperone unfolding/refolding activity of bacterial (DnaK, DnaJ or CbpA, GrpE) or human (HSPA1A, DNAJA1) Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperones. We found that α-Syn oligomers can specifically inhibit the function of the Hsp70/Hsp40 chaperone systems, suggesting that α-Syn oligomer-induced toxicity may also result from the specific stalling of the cellular chaperone machinery, leading to the collapse of protein homeostasis and pathogenesis. pT7 plasmid carrying the human wild-type (WT) α-Syn gene was expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli cells. Cells were grown in 1.2 liters of Lysogeny (Luria) Broth medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. At A0.6, 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and cells were further grown for 3 h. Centrifuged cells were sonicated in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg(Ac)2, 0.1% Na azide), 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and the protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma (catalog no. P8465). After 15 min of centrifugation at 6000 rpm, the supernatant was heated at 73 °C for 4.5 min. After a second 15-min centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, the supernatant was precipitated in 40% (NH4)2SO4 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After a 15-min centrifugation at 6000 rpm, the pellet was then resuspended in Buffer A, filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane, and loaded on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For each eluted peak, fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration in a 100-kDa cut-off membrane (Sartorius 13269E) and analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE or on a 5.5% native PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The total protein concentration was determined at 560 nm with the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and then stored in buffer A supplemented with 20% glycerol at −80 °C. Samples were separated on a 7.5% native PAGE or on a 12% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and transferred by electroblotting to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using standard protocols. Membranes were blocked in 1% skimmed milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-α-Syn polyclonal antibody (Stressgen, Ann Arbor, MI, catalog no. 905-565) (1/1000, v/v) and then incubated with a HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 170-5046) (1/15000, v/v). Immune complexes were visualized using the chemiluminescent ImmunstarTMKit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DnaK, DnaJ, and CbpA were purified according to Gur et al. (24Gur E. Biran D. Shechter N. Genevaux P. Georgopoulos C. Ron E.Z. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7236-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); ClpB was purified according to Woo et al. (25Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His-tagged Luciferase was expressed from the pT7lucC-His plasmid from A. S. Spirin (The Protein Research Institute, Moscow Region, Russia) and purified according to Svetlov et al. (26Svetlov M.S. Kolb V.A. Spirin A.S. Mol. Biol. 2007; 41: 86-92Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). GrpE was a gift from H.-J. Schönfeld, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland. Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides and BSA were from Sigma. Heat denaturation of the G6PDH was as described in Ben-Zvi et al. (27Ben-Zvi A. De Los Rios P. Dietler G. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37298-37303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cold inactivation of His-tagged Luciferase was achieved by four consecutive cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and slow thawing at 4 °C (62Sharma, S. K., De Los Rios, P., Christen, P., Lustig, A., Goloubinoff, P. (2010) Nat. Chem. Biol., doi:10.1038/nchembio.455.Google Scholar). 10 μl of α-Syn monomers or oligomers (1 μm each, expressed in protomers) in buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) were deposited onto freshly cleaved mica at room temperature. After 1 min, the sample was gently rinsed with 1 ml of nanopure H2O and dried. Samples were imaged using a Nanoscope III (Digital Instrument, Santa Barbara, CA) in the tapping mode. The probes were NSC35 (NT-MDT, Troisk, Russia). Heat-preaggregated G6PDH was refolded by the DnaK chaperone system as described in Ben-Zvi et al. (27Ben-Zvi A. De Los Rios P. Dietler G. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37298-37303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; 0.75 μm heat-aggregated G6PDH (final concentration) was reactivated in the presence of 5 μm DnaK, 5 μm DnaJ, 0.5 μm GrpE (the full DnaK chaperone system) or 5 μm HSPA1A and 5 μm DNAJA1 (the minimal human Hsp70/40 system), and 4 mm ATP. G6PDH activity was measured at different times of chaperone-mediated refolding reaction at 30 °C. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (26Svetlov M.S. Kolb V.A. Spirin A.S. Mol. Biol. 2007; 41: 86-92Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using a Victor Light 1420 Luminescence Counter from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Aliquots from each eluted fraction resulting from the gel filtration chromatography were diluted to a final concentration of 2.2 μm α-Syn and added to 0.75 μm heat-inactivated G6PDH and incubated in the presence of the full DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE bacterial system or the minimal Hsp70/Hsp40 human system at 30 °C for 1 h. G6PDH activity was measured at different times of chaperone-mediated refolding reaction. The β-sheet content of G6PDH and α-Syn were evaluated by measuring the fluorescence in a luminescence spectrometer, PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 (excitation, 446 nm; emission, 480 nm), in a 500-μl cuvette containing 10 μm thioflavin T (Th-T) (final concentration) in the refolding buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgAc, 10 mm DTT, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm PEP, and 0.02 mg/ml PK. To address the possible effects of unstructured α-Syn monomers and structured oligomers on the in vitro activity of a typical Hsp70/Hsp40/NEF chaperone system (here, the E. coli DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery), we first designed a protocol to purify a distinct population of stable α-Syn oligomers with reproducible characteristics. Immunoblots from SDS gels of soluble extracts from E. coli cells overexpressing plasmid-encoded human α-Syn revealed a predominant fraction of SDS-soluble 14.5-kDa α-Syn monomers (Fig. 1A, lane 1, I) and a minor fraction of SDS-resistant oligomers: some dimers (Fig. 1A, lane 1, II), high molecular weight species that migrated as 10–14-mers (Fig. 1A, lane 1, III), and very large insoluble oligomers that did not enter the resolution gel (Fig. 1A, lane 1, IV). To deplete this last insoluble fraction of very large SDS-resistant oligomers (fraction IV), the extract was heat-treated at 73 °C for 4.5 min and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 15 min) (Fig. 1A, lane 2). After ammonium sulfate precipitation, we obtained a much reduced fraction, albeit of ∼95% pure α-Syn, that was devoid of large insoluble species, composed of fully soluble, discrete oligomers that resolved on native gel mainly as 10–14 mers (140–200 kDa) as well as some dimers and monomers (Fig. 1B, lane 3). To better understand the relative size distribution of monomeric and oligomeric α-Syn complexes, this soluble fraction was further separated by gel filtration (Fig. 2A, blue line). As expected from the native gel (Fig. 1B), we observed two broad peaks; one corresponding to soluble high molecular weight (Mr) α-Syn oligomers ranging from 102 to 103 kDa (7.5–11 ml) with a very high specific affinity for the amyloid specific dye, Th-T, and a second that was resolved at the expected position of the 14.5-kDa α-Syn monomer (15–18 ml) with a very low specific affinity for Th-T (Fig. 2A, dark line). SDS and native gel electrophoresis confirmed that this low Mr fraction contained a uniform population of SDS-soluble 14.5-kDa monomers whose low affinity for Th-T is indicative of a lack of β-sheet structures, in agreement with the intrinsically unfolded state that is predominantly observed in the case of α-Syn monomers in vitro (13Uversky V.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2003; 21: 211-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In contrast, SDS and native gel electrophoresis confirmed that the high Mr, β-sheet-enriched fraction from the 7.5–11 ml peak was partially SDS-resistant (Fig. 2B) and formed on the native gel a remarkably discrete soluble α-Syn oligomer whose high stability was reflected by its ability to withstand extensive dilutions during gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2C). The discrete nature of this stable high Mr, yet soluble α-Syn oligomer was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (Fig. 2, D–G); whereas the low Mr fraction contained mostly α-Syn monomers, undetectable at this low resolution (Fig. 2D), the high Mr fraction showed a dense, remarkably homogeneous population of globular, mildly flattened oligomers (Fig. 2E), with a narrow size distribution (average diameter of 21 nm ± 3 nm) (Fig. 2G). The tapping procedure revealed a weaker region at the center of the particles, suggesting a less dense interior or a pore-like toroid (Fig. 2F) indistinguishable in size and shape from previously described toxic pore-forming α-Syn oligomers (20Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This protocol of production of stable α-Syn oligomers was highly reproducible. Yet, depending on the batches, α-Syn oligomers bound about 20 times more Th-T than monomeric α-Syn and about 8 times more than heat-aggregated G6PDH (Fig. 3A). G6PDH is a heat-generated misfolded protein substrate that is commonly used to test the unfolding/refolding activity of molecular chaperones (5Sharma S.K. Christen P. Goloubinoff P. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2009; 10: 432-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Ben-Zvi A. De Los Rios P. Dietler G. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37298-37303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The high stability of the β-sheet structures in the α-Syn oligomers was confirmed by their relative high resistance to prolonged (48 h) incubations after extensive dilutions; whereas prolonged incubations of heat-aggregated G6PDH caused a 33% loss of Th-T binding (Fig. 3B), only ∼8% loss of Th-T binding was observed in the case of α-Syn oligomers under identical conditions (Fig. 3C). We next addressed the biochemical properties of α-Syn oligomers as a possible substrate of the full E. coli Hsp70 chaperone machinery. Confirming earlier observations (27Ben-Zvi A. De Los Rios P. Dietler G. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37298-37303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP, heat-preaggregated G6PDH lost 25% of its Th-T binding structures within 50 min (Fig. 4A, open squares) and correspondingly formed 25% of natively refolded G6PDH enzyme (Fig. 4A, filled circles). In contrast, the α-Syn oligomers lost less than 10% of their Th-T binding structures (Fig. 4A, filled squares), indicating that although interacting with the aggregates, the chaperones are less effective at unfolding the misfolded β-sheets structures in α-Syn oligomers than in heat-aggregated G6PDH substrate. Remarkably, immunoblots of native gels confirmed that the Hsp70 chaperone machinery can convert a significant fraction of the stable α-Syn oligomers into monomers in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). This indicates that the chaperone machinery, although capable of interacting and causing the partial disassociation of the oligomers, are poorly effective at fully unfolding stably misfolded β-sheets structures into unstructured polypeptide segments. Thus, we next addressed the possibility that the oligomers may stall the Hsp70/40 chaperone machinery. The in vitro chaperone-mediated ATP-dependent reactivation of G6PDH was tested in the presence of increasing amounts of monomeric or oligomeric α-Syn (Fig. 5A). We found that the refolding rate of heat-pre-aggregated G6PDH by an excess of chaperones (5.0 μm DnaK, 1 μm DnaJ, and 0.5 μm GrpE) was strongly inhibited by α-Syn oligomers but not by the monomers. Half-inhibition of the chaperone reaction was observed in the presence of 2 μm α-Syn oligomers (expressed in protomers) (Fig. 5B). Remarkably, up to a 10-fold molar excess of monomeric α-Syn did not inhibit and was even slightly beneficial to the chaperone reaction (Fig. 5A, open circles). Chaperone inhibition was specific to α-Syn oligomers and not to other types of protein aggregates, as equimolar amounts of heat-aggregated MDH or of cold-inactivated luciferase did not compete with the chaperone-mediated reactivation of heat-denatured G6PDH (supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, the oligomers inhibited the chaperone-mediated refolding of cold-inactivated Luciferase to the same extent as they did in the case of heat-denatured G6PDH (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that inhibition is not caused by the competition between the different substrates for a limited amount of chaperones but rather by a non-competitive action mediated by a specific interaction of the oligomers with a component of the chaperone system. This specific chaperone inhibitory effect was further tested on different α-Syn oligomers with increasing apparent molecular masses (and/or shapes, as elongated proteins may elute with larger than real apparent molecular masses) obtained by gel filtration fractionation. Remarkably, the size/shape-dependent profile of the specific chaperone inhibitory activity (Fig. 5C) matched that of the specific Th-T binding (Figs. 2A and 5C), suggesting a strong correlation between the β-sheet or amyloid-like content of the α-Syn oligomers and their ability to inhibit the chaperone activity. The specific in vitro inhibitory effect of the α-Syn oligomers was confirmed with HSPA1A and DNAJA1, which represent a central hub of the stress-induced chaperone network and are among the most strongly expressed Hsp70 chaperone and Hsp40 co-chaperones of the cytoplasm of human cells, including PD neurons prone to α-Syn aggregation (61Finka, A., Mattoo, R. U., Goloubinoff, P. (2010) Cell Stress Chaperon., doi:10.1007/s12192-010-0216-8.Google Scholar). We found that, similar to E. coli Dnak/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones, α-Syn oligomers, but not monomers, strongly inhibited the human HSPA1A/DNAJA1 chaperone machinery (supplemental Fig. S3A). Moreover, in the presence of 1.5 μm DNAJA1, inhibition was half, and in the presence of 3 μm DNAJA1, inhibition was fully alleviated. This confirms that, as with bacterial chaperones, the inhibition of the human chaperone system by the α-Syn oligomers, but not by the monomers, is also predominantly caused by the incapacitation of the Hsp40 co-chaperone (supplemental Fig. S3B). Both chaperone and co-chaperone can bind to unfolded or misfolded proteins, albeit in different manners (28Han W. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whereas in its ADP-liganded and substrate-bound state, DnaK may tightly bind only to protruding unfolded hydrophobic polypeptide segments by tightly enclosing them, DnaJ may directly bind with much less steric limitations to bulky hydrophobic surfaces on misfolded structures on the substrate (28Han W. Christen P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 30Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next considered the possibility that β-sheet-enriched oligomers expose binding sites with a particular affinity for DnaJ, thereby potentially stalling the chaperone reaction. This was addressed by measuring the rates of ATP- and chaperone-mediated refolding without or with a fixed amount of oligomeric α-Syn in the presence of increasing concentrations of DnaK (Fig. 6A) or of DnaJ (or the DnaJ-like co-chaperone CbpA) (Fig. 6, B and C) or of chaperone substrate (Fig. 6D). The half inhibitory effect (IC50), which was observed at 5 μm DnaK, was not alleviated by higher DnaK concentrations of up to 13 μm (Fig. 6A), suggesting that inhibition is not because DnaK becomes sequestered by the oligomers. As expected, excess GrpE did not alleviate inhibition (data not shown), consistent with the fact that GrpE is a mere nucleotide exchange factor that exclusively interacts with DnaK. In contrast, increasing concentrations of the J-domain co-chaperones were found to gradually alleviate chaperone inhibition by oligomers (Fig. 6, B and C); inhibition was strongly diminished above 2.5 μm DnaJ and was negligible at 5 μm DnaJ (Fig. 6B). This was confirmed using CbpA, which can substitute for DnaJ in our type of in vitro DnaK-mediated protein disaggregation assays (24Gur E. Biran D. Shechter N. Genevaux P. Georgopoulos C. Ron E.Z. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7236-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the inhibition, which was initially set to 50%, remained so below 1 μm CbpA. The inhibition gradually decreased above 1 μm CbpA and in the presence of 5 μm CbpA was reduced to 10% (Fig. 6C). This suggests that α-Syn oligomers may inhibit the chaperone reaction by way of specifically sequestering the J-domain co-chaperones. Because the same quality of G6PDH aggregates cannot be obtained when they have been heat-denatured at different concentrations (31Diamant S. Ben-Zvi A.P. Bukau B. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we chose to use freeze-inactivated luciferase, which shows no differences of chaperone reactivity once inactivated at different concentrations (62Sharma, S. K., De Los Rios, P., Christen, P., Lustig, A., Goloubinoff, P. (2010) Nat. Chem. Biol., doi:10.1038/nchembio.455.Google Scholar) to test the effect of increasing concentrations of a chaperone substrate. Here again, the same amount of oligomers, which inhibited by half the chaperone-mediated refolding of 125 nm luciferase, kept inhibiting by more than half the refolding of five times more luciferase (650 nm) substrate (Fig. 6D). Thus, inhibition cannot be attributed to the sequestering of the chaperone substrate by α-Syn oligomers. DnaJ and α-Syn being devoid of Trp residues, we could follow the changes in the steady-state intrinsic fluorescence of the unique Trp residue, which is in the nucleotide binding domain of DnaK, in the presence of ATP and increasing amounts of monomeric or oligomeric α-Syn with or without DnaJ. Fluorescence changes (supplemental Fig. S4) showed that in the absence of DnaJ, DnaK had the same low apparent affinity for monomeric α-Syn as for oligomeric α-Syn. In contrast, in the presence of DnaJ, increasing am"

https://openalex.org/W2131721704,"Background Leafcutter ants depend on the cultivation of symbiotic Attamyces fungi for food, which are thought to be grown by the ants in single-strain, clonal monoculture throughout the hundreds to thousands of gardens within a leafcutter nest. Monoculture eliminates cultivar-cultivar competition that would select for competitive fungal traits that are detrimental to the ants, whereas polyculture of several fungi could increase nutritional diversity and disease resistance of genetically variable gardens. Methodology/Principal Findings Using three experimental approaches, we assessed cultivar diversity within nests of Atta leafcutter ants, which are most likely among all fungus-growing ants to cultivate distinct cultivar genotypes per nest because of the nests' enormous sizes (up to 5000 gardens) and extended lifespans (10–20 years). In Atta texana and in A. cephalotes, we resampled nests over a 5-year period to test for persistence of resident cultivar genotypes within each nest, and we tested for genetic differences between fungi from different nest sectors accessed through excavation. In A. texana, we also determined the number of Attamyces cells carried as a starter inoculum by a dispersing queens (minimally several thousand Attamyces cells), and we tested for genetic differences between Attamyces carried by sister queens dispersing from the same nest. Except for mutational variation arising during clonal Attamyces propagation, DNA fingerprinting revealed no evidence for fungal polyculture and no genotype turnover during the 5-year surveys. Conclusions/Significance Atta leafcutter ants can achieve stable, fungal monoculture over many years. Mutational variation emerging within an Attamyces monoculture could provide genetic diversity for symbiont choice (gardening biases of the ants favoring specific mutational variants), an analog of artificial selection."
https://openalex.org/W2020966949,"Leaf stripe disease on barley (Hordeum vulgare) is caused by the seed-transmitted hemi-biotrophic fungus Pyrenophora graminea. Race-specific resistance to leaf stripe is controlled by two known Rdg (Resistance to Drechslera graminea) genes: the H. spontaneum-derived Rdg1a and Rdg2a, identified in H. vulgare. The aim of the present work was to isolate the Rdg2a leaf stripe resistance gene, to characterize the Rdg2a locus organization and evolution and to elucidate the histological bases of Rdg2a-based leaf stripe resistance.We describe here the positional cloning and functional characterization of the leaf stripe resistance gene Rdg2a. At the Rdg2a locus, three sequence-related coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, and leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) encoding genes were identified. Sequence comparisons suggested that paralogs of this resistance locus evolved through recent gene duplication, and were subjected to frequent sequence exchange. Transformation of the leaf stripe susceptible cv. Golden Promise with two Rdg2a-candidates under the control of their native 5' regulatory sequences identified a member of the CC-NB-LRR gene family that conferred resistance against the Dg2 leaf stripe isolate, against which the Rdg2a-gene is effective. Histological analysis demonstrated that Rdg2a-mediated leaf stripe resistance involves autofluorescing cells and prevents pathogen colonization in the embryos without any detectable hypersensitive cell death response, supporting a cell wall reinforcement-based resistance mechanism.This work reports about the cloning of a resistance gene effective against a seed borne disease. We observed that Rdg2a was subjected to diversifying selection which is consistent with a model in which the R gene co-evolves with a pathogen effector(s) gene. We propose that inducible responses giving rise to physical and chemical barriers to infection in the cell walls and intercellular spaces of the barley embryo tissues represent mechanisms by which the CC-NB-LRR-encoding Rdg2a gene mediates resistance to leaf stripe in the absence of hypersensitive cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2047196857,"Malignant melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore alternative approaches to treat this disease, such as immunotherapy, are needed. Melanoma vaccine design has mainly focused on targeting CD8+ T cells. Activation of effector CD8+ T cells has been achieved in patients, but provided limited clinical benefit, due to immune-escape mechanisms established by advanced tumors. We have previously shown that alphavirus-based virus-like replicon particles (VRP) simultaneously activate strong cellular and humoral immunity against the weakly immunogenic melanoma differentiation antigen (MDA) tyrosinase. Here we further investigate the antitumor effect and the immune mechanisms of VRP encoding different MDAs.VRP encoding different MDAs were screened for their ability to prevent the growth of the B16 mouse transplantable melanoma. The immunologic mechanisms of efficacy were investigated for the most effective vaccine identified, focusing on CD8+ T cells and humoral responses. To this end, ex vivo immune assays and transgenic mice lacking specific immune effector functions were used. The studies identified a potent therapeutic VRP vaccine, encoding tyrosinase related protein 2 (TRP-2), which provided a durable anti-tumor effect. The efficacy of VRP-TRP2 relies on a novel immune mechanism of action requiring the activation of both IgG and CD8+ T cell effector responses, and depends on signaling through activating Fcγ receptors.This study identifies a VRP-based vaccine able to elicit humoral immunity against TRP-2, which plays a role in melanoma immunotherapy and synergizes with tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These findings will aid in the rational design of future immunotherapy clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W1989156362,"Heterochromatin is a form of highly compacted chromatin associated with epigenetic gene silencing and chromosome organization. We have previously shown that unphosphorylated nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) physically interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to promote heterochromatin stability. To understand whether STAT and heterochromatin are important for maintenance of genome stability, we genetically manipulated the levels of unphosphorylated STAT and HP1 [encoded by Su(var)205]in Drosophila and examined the effects on chromosomal morphology and resistance to DNA damage under conditions of genotoxic stress. Here we show that, compared with wild-type controls, Drosophila mutants with reduced levels of unphosphor-ylated STAT or heterochromatin are more sensitive to radiation-induced cell cycle arrest, have higher levels of spontaneous and radiation-induced DNA damage, and exhibit defects in chromosomal compaction and segregation during mitosis. Conversely, animals with increased levels of heterochromatin exhibit less DNA damage and increased survival rate after irradiation. These results suggest that maintaining genome stability by heterochromatin formation and correct chromosomal packaging is essential for normal cellular functions and for survival of animals under geno-toxic stress.—Yan, S.-J., Lim, S.

The mechanism for their nuclear import is unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism for the nuclear import of Mycd family members and demonstrated any correlation between such mechanism and the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In cultured VSMCs, the knockdown of importin β1 inhibited the nuclear import of Mycd and MRTF-A/B. Their NH2-terminal basic domain was identified as a binding site for importin α/β1 by in vitro analyses. However, Mycd had a higher affinity for importin α/β1 than did MRTF-A/B, even in the absence of G-actin, and Mycd affinity for importin α1/β1 was stronger than for any other importin α/β1 heterodimers. The binding of Mycd to importin α/β1 was insensitive to G-actin, whereas that of MRTF-A/B was differently inhibited by G-actin. In dedifferentiated VSMCs, the levels of importins α1 and β1 were reduced concomitant with down-regulation of Mycd, serum response factor, and smooth muscle cell markers. By contrast, in differentiated VSMCs, their expressions were up-regulated. Thus, the nuclear import of Mycd family members in VSMCs depends on importin α/β1, and their relative affinities for importin α/β1 heterodimers determine Mycd nuclear import. The expression of Mycd nuclear import machineries is related to the expression levels of VSMC phenotype-dependent smooth muscle cell markers.

Multipoint parametric and non-parametric (model-free) linkage analyses were used for the pedigrees.The most statistically significant linkage results were with markers on chromosome 4 (LOD=3.166 and NPL=3.65 with rs 875864, 4p16.1, 8.38 cM). Candidate genes within the 4p16.1 include EVC, EVC2.We detected a novel suggestive linkage locus for mandibular prognathism in two Chinese pedigrees, and this linkage region provides target for susceptibility gene identification, a process that will provide important insights into the molecular and cellular basis of mandibular prognathism."
https://openalex.org/W2013978706,"Elastic fibers are extracellular structures that provide stretch and recoil properties of tissues, such as lungs, arteries, and skin. Elastin is the predominant component of elastic fibers. Tropoelastin (TE), the precursor of elastin, is synthesized mainly during late fetal and early postnatal stages. The turnover of elastin in normal adult tissues is minimal. However, in several pathological conditions often associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, elastogenesis is re-initiated, but newly synthesized elastic fibers appear abnormal. We sought to determine the effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) on the assembly of TE into elastic fibers. Immunoblot analyses showed that TE is oxidatively and nitrosatively modified by peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and by activated monocytes and macrophages via release of ONOO− and HOCl. In an in vitro elastic fiber assembly model, oxidatively modified TE was unable to form elastic fibers. Oxidation of TE enhanced coacervation, an early step in elastic fiber assembly, but reduced cross-linking and interactions with other proteins required for elastic fiber assembly, including fibulin-4, fibulin-5, and fibrillin-2. These findings establish that ROS/RNS can modify TE and that these modifications affect the assembly of elastic fibers.

Thus, we speculate that oxidative stress may contribute to the abnormal structure and function of elastic fibers in pathological conditions. Elastic fibers are complex, insoluble extracellular matrix structures that are abundant in tissues such as the arteries, skin, and lungs. They provide architectural support, as well as the stretch and recoil required for normal function of these tissues. Elastic fibers consist of two major components, elastin and microfibrils. Elastin is an amorphous component that comprises most (>90%) of the mass of the mature elastic fiber. Microfibrils are fibrillar components that are rich in acidic glycoproteins, such as fibrilins (Fbns), 2The abbreviations used are: FbnfibrillinTEtropoelastinROSreactive oxygen speciesRNSreactive nitrogen speciesONOO−peroxynitriteHOClhypochlorous acidN-Tyr3-nitrotyrosineCOPDchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseFblnfibulinMAGPsmicrofibril-associated glycoproteinsLOXlysyl oxidaseLPSlipopolysaccharidesfMLPN-formyl-Met-Leu-PheUAuric acidLAlipoic acid. fibulins (Fblns), and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (MAGPs).

Elastogenic cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, secrete elastin as a soluble, precursor protein called tropoelastin (TE). Assembly of monomeric TE into elastic fibers is a multi-step process. TE monomers self-associate/coacervate into aggregates which are deposited onto pre-existing microfibrils. TE interacts with a number of different matrix proteins during the assembly process. For example, Fbln-4 and Fbln-5 facilitate TE alignment for cross-linking and deposition of cross-linked TE aggregates onto microfibrils. Microfibrillar components (MAGP-1, Fbn-1, and Fbn-2) align TE aggregates to undergo further cross-linking to form mature elastic fibers (5Cirulis J.T. Bellingham C.M. Davis E.C. Hubmacher D.

Elastin is mainly synthesized during late fetal and early postnatal stages and its turnover in normal adult tissues is negligible. However, in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, such as atherosclerosis and emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), excessive degradation, and/or inefficient repair of elastic fibers results in compromised tissue function. New elastin synthesis occurs in these pathological conditions suggesting elastic fiber repair mechanisms are activated. However, the integrity and organization of the elastic fibers is disrupted and the network discontinuous (10Deslee G. Woods J.C. Moore C.M. Liu L. Conradi S.H. Milne M. Gierada D.S. Pierce J.

These data suggest that there is aberrant assembly of newly synthesized TE into elastic fibers. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Oxidants can be generated by external factors such as cigarette smoke, or internal factors such as inflammatory cells, and mitochondrial respiration. These systems produce various reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, such as superoxide anion (O2̇̄), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (·OH), nitric oxide (NO), nitrite (NO2−) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (15Fearon I.M.

When free radicals exceed endogenous antioxidant capacity, they modify proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, carbonyl formation on side chains of specific amino acids (Lys, Arg, Pro, and Thr) occurs during oxidative stress, whereas 3-nitrotyrosine (N-Tyr) formation is a common modification that occurs as a result of nitration.

There is evidence that matrix proteins can be modified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in an alteration of protein structure and function.

We hypothesized that oxidants generated during oxidative stress in pathological conditions can modify newly synthesized TE and impair the assembly of TE into elastic fibers. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of oxidizing agents on TE and the effects of oxidized TE on different steps of elastic fiber assembly.

An 8.8 m stock of H2O2 was stored at room temperature. HOCl and H2O2 were diluted in sterile water. TE was diluted in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 and 150 mm NaCl), and ONOO−, HOCl, or H2O2 was added while vortexing. The solutions were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The pH was monitored to make sure that each reaction was performed at neutral pH. Oxidation of TE was detected by using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Treated and untreated TE was derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP), separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred to a Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore), and incubated with an anti-DNP antibody and an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Nitration of TE was detected by separation of treated and untreated TE on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and incubated with an anti-N-Tyr antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody.

Experiments were performed on at least four independent cell isolations. This study was reviewed and approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Human Studies Committee. Volunteers gave informed, written consent. Macrophages and monocytes (1 × 105) were diluted in DMEM containing protease inhibitor mixture and incubated with 1 µg of TE in the presence or absence of 10 µm fMLP plus 100 µg/ml LPS for 15 min at room temperature. In some experiments, 1 mm uric acid, the ONOO−-specific scavenger, 1 mm lipoic acid, the HOCl-specific scavenger, or both were incubated with the cells prior to the addition of activators. After 15 min of incubation, the solutions were centrifuged to pellet the cells and the supernatants containing TE was analyzed for oxidative and nitrosative modifications as described above. TE was incubated with cells in the absence of activators as a negative control. Immunoblots were scanned and analysis of the optical densities was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at National Institutes of Health). The data represent the mean ± S.E. from at least five independent experiments. All quantification was done on exposures in which individual bands were not yet saturating. Immunoprecipitation of TE was performed as mentioned elsewhere (39Davis E.C. Broekelmann T.J. Ozawa Y. Mecham R.P. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 140: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, unmodified and ONOO−-modified TE were incubated with the anti-N-Tyr antibody in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C overnight with gentle agitation. Protein A/G plus-agarose beads were added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The immune complex was centrifuged and the supernatant containing unbound, unmodified TE was collected. The beads with bound, nitrated TE were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 400 mm NaCl and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol was added to both supernatant and pellet and boiled for 10 min. Samples were adjusted for equal volume, separated on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto Immobilon-PVDF transfer membranes (Millipore). Oxidized, immunoprecipitated and unoxidized, soluble TE were detected using an anti-elastin antibody an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary, and the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System, and subsequent autoradiography. Incorporation of exogenously added TE into the microfibrils of ARPE-19 cells was performed as previously described (40Kozel B.A. Ciliberto C.H. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ARPE-19 cells were plated on four-well chamber culture slides and maintained at confluency for 8–10 days, after which oxidized and unoxidized TE were added at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in normal growth media described above. Cells were incubated for 1 h or 16 h at 37 °C and then fixed with ice-cold methanol. TE deposition onto pre-existing microfibrils was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-elastin BA4 monoclonal antibody, followed by TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Nitration of TE was confirmed using the rabbit anti-N-Tyr antibody, followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Coacervation was carried out as previously described (41Miao M. Cirulis J.T. Lee S. Keeley F.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14367-14375Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TE was exposed to ONOO− as described above and coacervation was monitored by increasing the solution temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min with constant stirring at 1000 rpm and measuring the absorbance at 440 nm using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV-visible recording spectrophotometer equipped with temperature controller. TE exposed to equal amount of NaOH was used as a carrier alone control. Cross-linking of TE was measured by the formation of desmosine. ARPE-19 cells were plated on 100 mm dishes and maintained confluent for 8–10 days, after which oxidized and unoxidized TE were added at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in normal growth media described above. Cells were incubated with the TE for 16 h at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and scraped into 1 ml of water. The samples were centrifuged, and the pellet was hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl overnight at a constant temperature of 110 °C. The desmosine content in hydrolysate was determined by radioimmunoassay (42Starcher B.C. Mecham R.P. Connect Tissue Res. 1981; 8: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 43Wachi H. Sato F.

Flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Costar, NY) were coated with 1 µg/well of unmodified, ONOO−-modified, or HOCl-modified TE in 10 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) at 4 °C overnight. The plates were rinsed with PBS, blocked with nonfat dry milk in PBS, and incubated with soluble ligands (Fbn-2, Fbln-4, Fbln-5, or MAGP1) in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 3 h. In the case of Fbln-4 and Fbln-5, binding was carried out in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The plates were then washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibody (anti-V5 antibody for Fbln-4 and Fbln-5, anti-Gly antibody for Fbn-2 (7Trask T.M. Trask B.C. Ritty T.M. Abrams W.R.

Binding of ligands was quantified using the ABTS Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) and measuring the absorbance at 410 nm. Equal coating of oxidized and unoxidized TE of the microtiter plate was confirmed using the BA4 anti-elastin antibody followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (data not shown). All statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 13 program. Paired Student's t test was used to analyze the relationship between unmodified and modified conditions.

Purified recombinant TE was exposed to ONOO−, HOCl, or H2O2 and modifications to TE were examined by immunoblot analysis. Concentrations of oxidants used were in a range similar to that produced by inflammatory cells (44Chen Y.R. Deterding L.J. Sturgeon B.E. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29781-29791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 45Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7426) Google Scholar, 46Weiss S.J. N.

Neither oxidation nor nitration of TE was detected in unmodified samples. Exposure of TE to HOCl also induced carbonyl formation (Fig. 1C), but H2O2 exposure did not (Fig. 1D). Exposure to ONOO−, HOCl, or H2O2 did not induce degradation or precipitation of TE, as shown by anti-elastin blots (Fig. 1). These data indicate that ONOO− and HOCl induces oxidative and nitrosative modifications to TE. Because injury-induced elastogenesis often occurs in inflammatory conditions, we examined whether ROS/RNS generated by activated inflammatory cells could modify TE. Purified TE was incubated with resident mouse peritoneal macrophages or human monocytes in the absence or presence of LPS and fMLP, which will activate the cells. Because activated monocytes and macrophages produce proteases that could degrade TE as well as ROS/RNS in response to LPS and fMLP, the incubation was performed in the presence of protease inhibitors. Incubation of TE with monocytes (Fig. 2A) or macrophages (Fig. 2B) alone failed to induce carbonyl formation of TE. In contrast, in the presence of LPS and fMLP, activated monocytes and macrophages induced the oxidation of TE, as determined by OxyBlot analyses. To determine which"
https://openalex.org/W2054557456,"The Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is an oncogenic transcription/translation factor that is activated by phosphorylation at S102 whereby it induces the expression of growth promoting genes such as EGFR and HER-2. We recently illustrated by an in vitro kinase assay that a novel peptide to YB-1 was highly phosphorylated by the serine/threonine p90 S6 kinases RSK-1 and RSK-2, and to a lesser degree PKCα and AKT. Herein, we sought to develop this decoy cell permeable peptide (CPP) as a cancer therapeutic. This 9-mer was designed as an interference peptide that would prevent endogenous YB-1S102 phosphorylation based on molecular docking. In cancer cells, the CPP blocked P-YB-1S102 and down-regulated both HER-2 and EGFR transcript level and protein expression. Further, the CPP prevented YB-1 from binding to the EGFR promoter in a gel shift assay. Notably, the growth of breast (SUM149, MDA-MB-453, AU565) and prostate (PC3, LNCap) cancer cells was inhibited by ∼90% with the CPP. Further, treatment with this peptide enhanced sensitivity and overcame resistance to trastuzumab in cells expressing amplified HER-2. By contrast, the CPP had no inhibitory effect on the growth of normal immortalized breast epithelial (184htert) cells, primary breast epithelial cells, nor did it inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. These data collectively suggest that the CPP is a novel approach to suppressing the growth of cancer cells while sparing normal cells and thereby establishes a proof-of-concept that blocking YB-1 activation is a new course of cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1969222627,"Background In many bacteria, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a key player in the regulation of the assimilation of alternative carbon sources notably through catabolic repression. The intracellular pathogens Brucella spp. possess four PTS proteins (EINtr, NPr, EIIANtr and an EIIA of the mannose family) but no PTS permease suggesting that this PTS might serve only regulatory functions. Methodology/Principal Findings In vitro biochemical analyses and in vivo detection of two forms of EIIANtr (phosphorylated or not) established that the four PTS proteins of Brucella melitensis form a functional phosphorelay. Moreover, in vitro the protein kinase HprK/P phosphorylates NPr on a conserved serine residue, providing an additional level of regulation to the B. melitensis PTS. This kinase activity was inhibited by inorganic phosphate and stimulated by fructose-1,6 bisphosphate. The genes encoding HprK/P, an EIIAMan-like protein and NPr are clustered in a locus conserved among α-proteobacteria and also contain the genes for the crucial two-component system BvrR-BvrS. RT-PCR revealed a transcriptional link between these genes suggesting an interaction between PTS and BvrR-BvrS. Mutations leading to the inactivation of EINtr or NPr significantly lowered the synthesis of VirB proteins, which form a type IV secretion system. These two mutants also exhibit a small colony phenotype on solid media. Finally, interaction partners of PTS proteins were identified using a yeast two hybrid screen against the whole B. melitensis ORFeome. Both NPr and HprK/P were shown to interact with an inorganic pyrophosphatase and the EIIAMan-like protein with the E1 component (SucA) of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Conclusions/Significance The B. melitensis can transfer the phosphoryl group from PEP to the EIIAs and a link between the PTS and the virulence of this organism could be established. Based on the protein interaction data a preliminary model is proposed in which this regulatory PTS coordinates also C and N metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1972588865,"The relationship between amyloid deposition and cellular toxicity is still controversial. In addition to fibril-forming oligomers, other soluble Aβ forms (amyloid β-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs)) were also suggested to form and to present different morphologies and mechanisms of toxicity. One ADDL type, the ""globulomer,"" apparently forms independently of the fibril aggregation pathway. Even though many studies argue that such soluble Aβ oligomers are off fibril formation pathways, they may nonetheless share some structural similarity with protofibrils. NMR data of globulomer intermediates, ""preglobulomers,"" suggested parallel in-register C-terminal β-sheets, with different N-terminal conformations. Based on experimental data, we computationally investigate four classes of Aβ dodecamers: fibril, fibril oligomer, prefibril/preglobulomer cluster, and globulomer models. Our simulations of the solvent protection of double-layered fibril and globulomer models reproduce experimental observations. Using a single layer Aβ fibril oligomer β-sheet model, we found that the C-terminal β-sheet in the fibril oligomer is mostly curved, preventing it from quickly forming a fibril and leading to its breaking into shorter pieces. The simulations also indicate that β-sheets packed orthogonally could be the most stable species for Aβ dodecamers. The major difference between fibril-forming oligomers and ADDL-like oligomers (globulomers) could be the exposure of Met-35 patches. Although the Met-35 patches are necessarily exposed in fibril-forming oligomers to allow their maturation into fibrils, the Met-35 patches in the globulomer are covered by other residues in the orthogonally packed Aβ peptides. Our results call attention to the possible existence of certain ""critical intermediates"" that can lead to both seeds and other soluble ADDL-like oligomers."

We found that Hcm1 interacts with the histone deacetylase Sir2 and shifts from cytoplasm to the nucleus in the G1/S phase or in response to oxidative stress stimuli. The nuclear localization of Hcm1 depends on the activity of Sir2 as revealed by activators and inhibitors of the sirtuins and the Δsir2 mutant.

IntroductionMammalian FoxO transcription factors (FoxO1, 3, 4, and 6), a subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (FKH-TFs), 3The abbreviations used are: FKH-TFforkhead transcription factorPFAp-formaldehydeMDmenadioneROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutasemtDNAmitochondrial DNA. control various biological functions, including stress resistance, DNA repair, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2Arden K.C. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2345-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Van der Horst A. Burgering B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). According to this variety of functions, FoxO transcription factors are regulated in these diverse functions by a wide range of external stimuli, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, other growth factors, neurotrophins, nutrients, cytokines, and oxidative stress stimuli. These stimuli control FoxO protein levels, subcellular localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. FoxO are subject to several post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (1Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4Vogt P.K. Jiang H. Aoki M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae has four genes (FKH1, FKH2, FHL1, and HCM1) homologous to the forkhead family of eukaryotic transcription factors, classified on the basis of a conserved DNA-binding domain (5Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). Fkh1 (Forkhead homolog 1) and its closest homolog, Fkh2, are involved in transcriptional silencing, cell morphology and cell cycle (6Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Müller U. Fox C.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M.

Nature. 2000; 406: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Fhl1 has been described as regulating transcription of ribosome-associated proteins (9Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Kleinschmidt M. Schulz R. Braus G.H. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hcm1 was first identified as a high copy suppressor of a defect in spindle pole assembly (11Zhu G. Muller E.G. Amacher S.L. Northrop J.L. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This cell cycle-specific transcription factor regulates the transcription of genes involved in chromosome segregation (7Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). HCM1 is periodically transcribed and expressed in late G1 and early S phase. Genes regulated by Hcm1 peak primarily during the late S phase, and some of them are involved in chromosome organization, spindle dynamics, and budding (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although chromosome segregation is impaired in the absence of Hcm1, budding kinetics under optimal growth conditions in Δhcm1 cells is quite similar to wild-type cells (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In mammals, oxidative stress (H2O2 treatment) increases both FoxO phosphorylation and nuclear localization (13Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 14Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), although decreased nuclear localization has also been reported (15Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation, FoxO acetylation/deacetylation in response to oxidative stress stimuli also affects FoxO subcellular localization. Deacetylation is mainly catalyzed by Sirt1 (the ortholog of yeast Sir2), although other histone deacetylases may regulate FoxO deacetylation and localization (14Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). At present, most studies indicate that FoxO acetylation functions to repress FoxO activity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, extension of lifespan by Sir2 requires the presence of DAF16, which is the only homolog of the FOXO family of FKH-TF (16Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). This suggests that acetylation directly or indirectly regulates Daf16.Yeast Sir2 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase involved in silencing telomeres, mating locus and rDNA, maintaining genome integrity, and aging (17Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Deletion of SIR2 shortens life span, whereas yeast strains with an extra copy of the SIR2 extend lifespan (18Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Lifespan extension by Sir2 also was observed in C. elegans (19Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of this sirtuin is extended through evolution. Although it is established that FOXO genes are highly conserved in various organisms, the connection between oxidative stress, yeast FKH-TF, and Sir2 is poorly known. Oxidative stress can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and thereby compromise cell viability. The effects of external oxidative stress on yeast cell cycle depend on the stress-exerting agent. At low concentrations, H2O2 results in S phase delay followed by G2/M arrest; menadione (MD) arrests cells at G1 (20Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Through a transcription regulatory complex, yeast FKH-TF (Fkh1 and especially Fkh2) is involved in H2O2-induced cell cycle arrest and explains the difference between H2O2 and MD effects on cell cycle arrest (21Shapira M. Segal E. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is no experimental evidence of a stress response directly orchestrated by the forkhead factor.In this study we describe a new role of Hcm1 as a transcription factor involved in oxidative stress resistance that includes Sir2 activity. Hcm1 interacts with Sir2, and Sir2 activity increases nuclear Hcm1 localization. The results also uncover a novel role of Hcm1 in mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis that contributes to stress resistance and an adapting role in an early response to nutrient scarcity.DISCUSSIONThe localization of Hcm1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus was mentioned in a large scale analysis for protein localization in budding yeast (50Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Our results show that Hcm1 can shift from cytoplasmic to nuclear localization in the G1/S phase in synchronized cells, in agreement with its known cell cycle-specific role (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress results in increased nuclear Hcm1 localization. These observations opened the possibility that Hcm1 could interact with sirtuins, as reported for FoxO1 and FoxO3 (3Van der Horst A. Burgering B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The results shown in this paper indicate that Sir2 and Hcm1 interact in normal conditions and also under oxidative stress. The physiological relevance of such interaction has been demonstrated in the Δsir2 strain and with the use of activators and inhibitors of situins. Δsir2 cultures presented lower percentage of cells with nuclear Hcm1 and a decreased translocation of Hcm1 in response to oxidative stress and along cell cycle. Moreover, activation or inactivation of sirtuins increases or decreases nuclear trapping of Hcm1, respectively. All of these results strongly support a role for Sir2 activity in Hcm1 localization, increasing its nuclear trapping. The shuttling of mammalian FoxO transcription factors between nucleus and cytoplasm is regulated by a complex series of phosphorylations, acetylations, and ubiquitination (4Vogt P.K. Jiang H. Aoki M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 51Qiang L. Banks A.S. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27396-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast Hcm1, the signal(s) regulating nuclear translocation is still uncertain, although Hcm1 was described as being directly phosphorylated by Cdc28 in whole cell extracts (52Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Using the NetNes 1.1 prediction program (53la Cour T. Kiemer L. Mølgaard A. Gupta R. Skriver K. Brunak S. Protein Eng Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) allows the identification of a putative Leu-rich nuclear export sequence from amino acids 88 to 97 in the Hcm1 sequence. In fact only Leu90 reaches the program threshold, but the sequence L88XL90XXXL94XXL97 is quite similar to the canonical nuclear export sequence signal: LX2–3LX2–3LXL (54Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).The fact that Hcm1, as a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation, is also involved in the resistance to different stresses uncovers a new function of Hcm1. Previous studies (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) collected microarray data across the cell cycle and identified a late S phase-specific promoter element described as the binding site for Hcm1 required for its cell cycle specific activity. In a recent study (7Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), analysis of several transcription factors performed by ChIP-on-chip demonstrates that a large proportion of Hcm1 target genes are also involved in bud growth, vesicular trafficking, and cell wall synthesis. Approximately 22% of Hcm1 targets have predicted functions in the synthesis of the cell wall including structural proteins, although 28 of Hcm1 gene targets were involved in carbohydrate metabolism or high affinity glucose transporters. The results presented in this paper indicate that comparing cell viability and protein oxidative damage, increased dosage of Hcm1 results in cells more resistant to thermal stress, H2O2, and especially MD. Accordingly, all of these properties recede in doxycycline-treated tetHCM1 cells. The increased Hcm1 nuclear localization is in agreement with this new protective role against oxidative stress. Sir2 activity plays a role on the increased resistance observed in cells overexpressing Hcm1. Proteins were not protected upon oxidative stress in tetHCM1 cells when pretreated with sirtuin inhibitors.In Hcm1-overexpressing cells, increased oxygen consumption and decreased alcohol dehydrogenase activity produced a metabolic change, resulting in cells with higher respiration rates. Consequently, this metabolic shift, partially resembling what occurs under calorie restriction, implies that these cells have longer duplication times in glucose-rich medium. Two results, as compared with WT cells, indicate that their mitochondria are fully functional: better fitness entering the diauxic phase, yielding higher cell densities at stationary phase, and lower superoxide levels inside the cells. This may be the sum of two processes: higher Sod2 activity and lower ROS generation. The fact that increased respiratory metabolism results in decreased endogenous stress may be somewhat surprising, because ROS generation mainly occurs in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. However, it has been described that a functionally correct respiratory chain generates less ROS (55Barros M.H. Bandy B. Tahara E.B. Kowaltowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49883-49888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 56Barja G. Rej Res. 2007; 10: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).An important finding of this study describes a new role for Hcm1, participating in both mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis as shown by an increase in the number of mitochondria, the induction of specific proteins, and mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Induction of mitochondrial metabolism by Hcm1 was demonstrated by the higher respiration rates observed and increased levels of mitochondrial proteins in cells overexpressing Hcm1. Data from microarray analyses also support the induction of a respiratory metabolism. In this context, several genes from the proline utilization pathway are up-regulated. PUT1, coding for the mitochondrial proline oxidase, is highly induced. It catalyzes the conversion of proline into glutamate. PUT1 transcription is induced in the absence of a preferred nitrogen source (57Saxena D. Kannan K.B. Brandriss M.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Glutamate can be sequentially converted into succinate by a mitochondrial pathway involving clearly induced genes such as glutamate decarboxylase GAD1, UGA1, and UGA2 (58Coleman S.T. Fang T.K. Rovinsky S.A. Turano F.J. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 244-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Glutamate can also produce α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH2) (59Miller S.M. Magasanik B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4927-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also highly induced. These metabolic pathways can be envisaged as a mechanism for replenishing Krebs cycle intermediates necessary for respiratory metabolism displayed by Hcm1-overexpressing cells.It is also worth mentioning that the ISF1 gene, showing a 4-fold increase, is repressed by fermentative metabolism and was initially described as a possible modulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (15Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) and later as a suppressor of Hap2 mutants. The transcriptional activator Hap2 is a subunit of the global regulator of respiratory gene expression (43Daignan-Fornier B. Nguyen C.C. Reisdorf P. Lemeignan B. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Mol. Gen Genet. 1994; 243: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, ADR1, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes repressed by glucose shows a 3-fold induction. Adr1 also activates the expression of genes required for the mitochondrial metabolism of glycerol, ethanol, and lipids, as well as peroxisome biogenesis (60Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Newman S.M. Okamoto K. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1763-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61O'Rourke T.W. Doudican N.A. Mackereth M.D. Doetsch P.W. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4086-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).All of these events can be envisaged as a preparation for the diauxic shift, because in this phase cells change from fermentative to respiratory metabolism with the concomitant increase in ROS production. From data in Fig. 7A, it is observed that cells lacking Hcm1 are unable to enter in diauxic shift, in contrast to wild-type cells and those overexpressing Hcm1, which are the best fitted for the transition to diauxic shift and, as a consequence, yield higher culture densities. How can this phenotype be explained? From the microarray analyses, it could be observed that genes important for such transition, such as YGP1 (62Jin C. Barrientos A. Epstein C.B. Butow R.A. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 5658-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), SPI1 (stationary phase induced 1) (63Tachibana C. Yoo J.Y. Tagne J.B. Kacherovsky N. Lee T.I. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2138-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and GAC1 (64Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) are up-regulated in the tetHCM1 cells. Molecular chaperones related to response to several stresses are up-regulated in tetHCM1 cells. Examples include HSP26, a cytosolic chaperone induced by heat shock, cell cycle arrest, oxidative stress, or nitrogen or carbon starvation (65Destruelle M. Holzer H. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and members of the HSP70 family chaperones (SSA4 and SSB1) and HSP30, which are induced in the diauxic shift and by a variety of stresses.Another key point of the transcript array analysis is the fact that Hcm1 overexpression induces a set of genes involved in the de novo synthesis of NAD, of which BNA4 showed the highest induction levels. The genes involved in the NAD salvage pathway were unaffected by Hcm1 overexpression. The implications of such activation are crucial for the cell because activating NAD biosynthesis is a key fact for respiratory metabolism as well as for the activity of NAD-dependent histone deacetylases.Hcm1 not only induces mitochondrial metabolism but also mitochondrial biogenesis. Increased mitochondrial content in tetHCM1 cells was detected with the fluorophor MitoTracker and measured by citrate synthase activity. Consistently, Δhcm1 cells or tetHCM1 cells treated with doxycycline presented citrate synthase activity significantly lower than WT cells. How does Hcm1 regulate mitochondrial content? Among the genes up-regulated in the tetHCM1 cells, ABF2 was especially interesting. Abf2 is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein member of the HMG (high mobility group) box, mtDNA-binding protein family and involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. The human homolog of Abf2 is mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) (66Parisi M.A. Clayton D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Abf2 has multiple functions in mtDNA metabolism, including stabilization of recombination intermediates (45MacAlpine D.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6739-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), segregation, and dynamics of nucleoids (67Puig S. Perez-Ortin J.E. Yeast. 2000; 16: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and oxidative DNA damage resistance (68Parrou J.L. Enjalbert B. Plourde L. Bauche A. Gonzalez B. François J. Yeast. 1999; 15: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is also one of the first protein factors proposed to have a direct role in regulating mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial biogenesis (45MacAlpine D.M. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6739-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 48Cho J.H. Lee Y.K. Chae C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1522: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By RT-PCR we confirmed that mRNA levels of ABF2 correlate with Hcm1 (Fig. 9C), and more important, we found increased amounts of Abf2 when Hcm1 is overexpressed (Fig. 7E). The increment in Abf2 expression observed is significant because a moderate overexpression of Abf2 has been found to increase mtDNA copy number ∼1.5–2-fold, and deletion of the ABF2 gene results in ∼50% reduction (67Puig S. Perez-Ortin J.E. Yeast. 2000; 16: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mec1/Rad53, an alternative pathway to regulate mitochondrial DNA copy number, can increase mtDNA in an abf2 null mutant, suggesting that the two pathways can work independently (69Amorós M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It could be that both pathways can act in the same direction, with Hcm1 being responsible for the increased amount of Abf2, which, in turn, would trigger the formation of mitochondria.In conclusion, our results show that Hcm1 is involved in the formation of mitochondria and expressing genes involved in responses to stress, as well as inducing genes that are repressed under high glucose. These metabolic changes allow cells to shift from fermentative to respiratory metabolism conferring higher stress resistance. In yeasts, such metabolic features will be of special importance for entering in the diauxic shift and early stationary phase. IntroductionMammalian FoxO transcription factors (FoxO1, 3, 4, and 6), a subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (FKH-TFs), 3The abbreviations used are: FKH-TFforkhead transcription factorPFAp-formaldehydeMDmenadioneROSreactive oxygen speciesSODsuperoxide dismutasemtDNAmitochondrial DNA. control various biological functions, including stress resistance, DNA repair, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2Arden K.C. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2345-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Van der Horst A. Burgering B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). According to this variety of functions, FoxO transcription factors are regulated in these diverse functions by a wide range of external stimuli, such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor, other growth factors, neurotrophins, nutrients, cytokines, and oxidative stress stimuli. These stimuli control FoxO protein levels, subcellular localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. FoxO are subject to several post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination (1Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 4Vogt P.K. Jiang H. Aoki M. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Saccharomyces cerevisiae has four genes (FKH1, FKH2, FHL1, and HCM1) homologous to the forkhead family of eukaryotic transcription factors, classified on the basis of a conserved DNA-binding domain (5Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). Fkh1 (Forkhead homolog 1) and its closest homolog, Fkh2, are involved in transcriptional silencing, cell morphology and cell cycle (6Hollenhorst P.C. Bose M.E. Mielke M.R. Müller U. Fox C.A. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 8Zhu G. Spellman P.T. Volpe T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Davis T.N. Futcher B. Nature. 2000; 406: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Fhl1 has been described as regulating transcription of ribosome-associated proteins (9Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Kleinschmidt M. Schulz R. Braus G.H. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Hcm1 was first identified as a high copy suppressor of a defect in spindle pole assembly (11Zhu G. Muller E.G. Amacher S.L. Northrop J.L. Davis T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This cell cycle-specific transcription factor regulates the transcription of genes involved in chromosome segregation (7Horak C.E. Luscombe N.M. Qian J. Bertone P. Piccirrillo S. Gerstein M. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3017-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). HCM1 is periodically transcribed and expressed in late G1 and early S phase. Genes regulated by Hcm1 peak primarily during the late S phase, and some of them are involved in chromosome organization, spindle dynamics, and budding (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although chromosome segregation is impaired in the absence of Hcm1, budding kinetics under optimal growth conditions in Δhcm1 cells is quite similar to wild-type cells (12Pramila T. Wu W. Miles S. Noble W.S. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In mammals, oxidative stress (H2O2 treatment) increases both FoxO phosphorylation and nuclear localization (13Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 14Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), although decreased nuclear localization has also been reported (15Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylation, FoxO acetylation/deacetylation in response to oxidative stress stimuli also affects FoxO subcellular localization. Deacetylation is mainly catalyzed by Sirt1 (the ortholog of yeast Sir2), although other histone deacetylases may regulate FoxO deacetylation and localization (14Frescas D. Valenti L. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). At present, most studies indicate that FoxO acetylation functions to repress FoxO activity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, extension of lifespan by Sir2 requires the presence of DAF16, which is the only homolog of the FOXO family of FKH-TF (16Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). This suggests that acetylation directly or indirectly regulates Daf16.Yeast Sir2 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase involved in silencing telomeres, mating locus and rDNA, maintaining genome integrity, and aging (17Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Deletion of SIR2 shortens life span, whereas yeast strains with an extra copy of the SIR2 extend lifespan (18Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Lifespan extension by Sir2 also was observed in C. elegans (19Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Nature. 2001; 410: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of this sirtuin is extended through evolution. Although it is established that FOXO genes are highly conserved in various organisms, the connection between oxidative stress, yeast FKH-TF, and Sir2 is poorly known. Oxidative stress can damage proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids and thereby compromise cell viability. The effects of external oxidative stress on yeast cell cycle depend on the stress-exerting agent. At low concentrations, H2O2 results in S phase delay followed by G2/M arrest; menadione (MD) arrests cells at G1 (20Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Through a transcription regulatory complex, yeast FKH-TF (Fkh1 and especially Fkh2) is involved in H2O2-induced cell cycle arrest and explains the difference between H2O2 and MD effects on cell cycle arrest (21Shapira M. Segal E. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, there is no experimental evidence of a stress response directly orchestrated by the forkhead factor.In this study we describe a new role of Hcm1 as a transcription factor involved in oxidative stress resistance that includes Sir2 activity. Hcm1 interacts with Sir2, and Sir2 activity increases nuclear Hcm1 localization. The results also uncover a novel role of Hcm1 in mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis that contributes to stress resistance and an adapting role in an early response to nutrient scarcity."
https://openalex.org/W2046496053,"Regional genetic connectivity models are critical for successful conservation and management of marine species. Even though rocky shore invertebrates have been used as model systems to understand genetic structure in some marine environments, our understanding of connectivity in Caribbean communities is based overwhelmingly on studies of tropical fishes and corals. In this study, we investigate population connectivity and diversity of Cittarium pica, an abundant rocky shore trochid gastropod that is commercially harvested across its natural range, from the Bahamas to Venezuela.We tested for genetic structure using DNA sequence variation at the mitochondrial COI and 16S loci, AMOVA and distance-based methods. We found substantial differentiation among Caribbean sites. Yet, genetic differentiation was associated only with larger geographic scales within the Caribbean, and the pattern of differentiation only partially matched previous assessments of Caribbean connectivity, including those based on larval dispersal from hydrodynamic models. For instance, the Bahamas, considered an independent region by previous hydrodynamic studies, showed strong association with Eastern Caribbean sites in our study. Further, Bonaire (located in the east and close to the meridional division of the Caribbean basin) seems to be isolated from other Eastern sites.The significant genetic structure and observed in C. pica has some commonalities in pattern with more commonly sampled taxa, but presents features, such as the differentiation of Bonaire, that appear unique. Further, the level of differentiation, together with regional patterns of diversity, has important implications for the application of conservation and management strategies in this commercially harvested species."
https://openalex.org/W1998575695,"Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) possess multipotent differentiation capabilities and are a potent source of paracrine factors. We show how the epidermal keratinocyte can direct hMSC differentiation selectively. Keratinocytes and hMSCs were either cocultured in physical contact (contact cocultures), or separated without physical contact using a transwell insert (noncontact cocultures). We also delivered hMSCs into an ex vivo human excisional wound where subpopulations of the hMSCs were either in contact or were physically separated from the epidermal keratinocytes. In comparison to control hMSCs that were not cocultured, contact cocultured hMSCs adopted an epithelial morphology and expressed keratinocyte markers while noncontact cocultured hMSCs, surprisingly, adopted phenotypes that resembled myofibroblast and early neural lineage, both of which are of dermal origin. Cell fusion was not a requirement in in vitro contact cocultures, as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (FISH). To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first example of hMSC differentiation into different lineages depending on their proximity to a single cell type."
https://openalex.org/W2079751846,"Human β-defensins (hBDs) are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides, secreted by mucosal epithelial cells that regulate adaptive immune functions. We previously reported that Fusobacterium nucleatum, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium of the human oral cavity, induces human β-defensin 2 (hBD2) upon contact with primary oral epithelial cells. We now report the isolation and characterization of an F. nucleatum (ATCC 25586)-associated defensin inducer (FAD-I). Biochemical approaches revealed a cell wall fraction containing four proteins that stimulated the production of hBD2 in human oral epithelial cells (HOECs). Cross-referencing of the N-terminal sequences of these proteins with the F. nucleatum genome revealed that the genes encoding the proteins were FadA, FN1527, FN1529, and FN1792. Quantitative PCR of HOEC monolayers challenged with Escherichia coli clones expressing the respective cell wall proteins revealed that FN1527 was most active in the induction of hBD2 and hence was termed FAD-I. We tagged FN1527 with a c-myc epitope on the C-terminal end to identify and purify it from the E. coli clone. Purified FN1527 (FAD-I) induced hBD2 mRNA and protein expression in HOEC monolayers. F. nucleatum cell wall and FAD-I induced hBD2 via TLR2. Porphorymonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen that does not induce hBD2 in HOECs, was able to significantly induce expression of hBD2 in HOECs only when transformed to express FAD-I. FAD-I or its derivates offer a potentially new paradigm in immunoregulatory therapeutics because they may one day be used to bolster the innate defenses of vulnerable mucosae."
https://openalex.org/W1979794305,"DNA methylation and histone modifications play an important role in transcription regulation. In cancer cells, many promoters become aberrantly methylated through the activity of the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b and acquire repressive chromatin marks. NEDD8 is a ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is conjugated to target proteins, such as cullins, to regulate their activity, and cullin 4A (CUL4A) in its NEDD8-modified form is essential for repressive chromatin formation. We found that DNMT3b associates with NEDD8-modified proteins. Whereas DNMT3b interacts directly in vitro with NEDD8, conjugation of NEDD8 to target proteins enhances this interaction in vivo. DNMT3b immunoprecipitated two major bands of endogenously NEDDylated proteins at the size of NEDDylated cullins, and indeed DNMT3b interacted with CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A, and CUL5. Moreover, DNMT3b preferentially immunoprecipitated the NEDDylated form of endogenous CUL4A. NEDD8 enhanced DNMT3b-dependent DNA methylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that DNMT3b recruits CUL4A and NEDD8 to chromatin, whereas deletion of Dnmt3b reduces the association of CUL4A and NEDD8 at a repressed promoter in a cancer cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1965797423,"The cochaperone cysteine-string protein (Csp) is located on vesicles and participates in the control of neurotransmission and hormone exocytosis. Csp contains several domains, and our previous work demonstrated the requirement of the Csp linker domain in regulated exocytosis of insulin in rodent pancreatic β cells. We now address the molecular details to gain insight into the sequence of events during exocytosis. According to pulldown experiments and in vitro binding assays, Cspα interacts indirectly with SNAP-25 and directly with the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 9 (Syt9), which could be an intermediate between the chaperone and the t-SNARE. The C(2)A calcium binding domain of Syt9 and the linker domain of Cspα constituted the minimal interacting module. FRET-FLIM experiments confirmed the interaction between Syt9 and Cspα. Moreover, the point mutation E93V in the linker domain of Cspα significantly reduced the interaction between the two proteins. Molecular modeling revealed that this point mutation abolished a charged prominence on the surface of Cspα required for interaction. Strikingly, free calcium in the physiological low micromolar range enhanced the interaction between Syt9 and the linker domain of Cspα in vitro. These data indicate that Cspα interacts with Syt9, and such a complex may be relevant in the calcium-mediated control of a late stage of exocytosis by triggering the specific recruitment of a folding catalyst at the fusion point."
https://openalex.org/W1987888574,"In the heart, the energy supplied by mitochondria to myofibrils is continuously and finely tuned to the contraction requirement over a wide range of cardiac loads. This process is mediated both by the creatine kinase (CK) shuttle and by direct ATP transfer. The aim of this study was to identify the contribution of energy transfer pathways at different cardiac performance levels. For this, five protocols of (31)P NMR inversion and saturation transfer experiments were performed at different performance levels on Langendorff perfused rat hearts. The cardiac performance was changed either through variation of external calcium in the presence or absence of isoprenaline or through variation of LV balloon inflation. The recordings were analyzed by mathematical models composed on the basis of different energy transfer pathway configurations. According to our results, the total CK unidirectional flux was relatively stable when the cardiac performance was changed by increasing the calcium concentration or variation of LV balloon volume. The stability of total CK unidirectional flux is lost at extreme energy demand levels leading to a rise in inorganic phosphate, a drop of ATP and phosphocreatine, a drop of total CK unidirectional flux, and to a bypass of CK shuttle by direct ATP transfer. Our results provide experimental evidence for the existence of two pathways of energy transfer, direct ATP transfer, and PCr transfer through the CK shuttle, whose contribution may vary depending on the metabolic status of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1968207492,"The p53 DNA-binding domain harbors a conformationally flexible multiprotein binding site that regulates p53 ubiquitination. A novel phosphorylation site exists within this region at Ser(269), whose phosphomimetic mutation inactivates p53. The phosphomimetic p53 (S269D) exhibits characteristics of mutant p53: stable binding to Hsp70 in vivo, elevated ubiquitination in vivo, inactivity in DNA binding and transcription, increased thermoinstability using thermal shift assays, and λ(max) of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at 403 nm rather than 346 nm, characteristic of wild type p53. These data indicate that p53 conformational stability is regulated by a phosphoacceptor site within an exposed flexible surface loop and that this can be destabilized by phosphorylation. To test whether other motifs within p53 have similarly evolved, we analyzed the effect of Ser(215) mutation on p53 function because Ser(215) is another inactivating phosphorylation site in the conformationally flexible PAb240 epitope. The p53(S215D) protein is inactive like p53(S269D), whereas p53(S215A) is as active as p53(S269A). However, the double mutant p53(S215A/S269A) was transcriptionally inactive and more thermally unstable than either individual Ser-Ala loop mutant. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that (i) solvation of phospho-Ser(215) and phospho-Ser(269) by positive charged residues or solvent water leads to local unfolding, which is accompanied by local destabilization of the N-terminal loop and global destabilization of p53, and (ii) the double alanine 215/269 mutation disrupts hydrogen bonding normally stabilized by both Ser(215) and Ser(269). These data indicate that p53 has evolved two serine phosphoacceptor residues within conformationally flexible epitopes that normally stabilize the p53 DNA-binding domain but whose phosphorylation induces a mutant conformation to wild type p53."
https://openalex.org/W2036790374,"The network organization of type IV collagen consisting of α3, α4, and α5 chains in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is speculated to involve interactions of the triple helical and NC1 domain of individual α-chains, but in vivo evidence is lacking. To specifically address the contribution of the NC1 domain in the GBM collagen network organization, we generated a mouse with specific loss of α3NC1 domain while keeping the triple helical α3 chain intact by connecting it to the human α5NC1 domain. The absence of α3NC1 domain leads to the complete loss of the α4 chain. The α3 collagenous domain is incapable of incorporating the α5 chain, resulting in the impaired organization of the α3α4α5 chain-containing network. Although the α5 chain can assemble with the α1, α2, and α6 chains, such assembly is incapable of functionally replacing the α3α4α5 protomer. This novel approach to explore the assembly type IV collagen in vivo offers novel insights in the specific role of the NC1 domain in the assembly and function of GBM during health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2153977345,"Mammals are able to rapidly produce red blood cells in response to stress. The molecular pathways used in this process are important in understanding responses to anaemia in multiple biological settings. Here we characterise the novel gene Claudin 13 (Cldn13), a member of the Claudin family of tight junction proteins using RNA expression, microarray and phylogenetic analysis. We present evidence that Cldn13 appears to be co-ordinately regulated as part of a stress induced erythropoiesis pathway and is a mouse-specific gene mainly expressed in tissues associated with haematopoietic function. CLDN13 phylogenetically groups with its genomic neighbour CLDN4, a conserved tight junction protein with a putative role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition, suggesting a recent duplication event. Mechanisms of mammalian stress erythropoiesis are of importance in anaemic responses and expression microarray analyses demonstrate that Cldn13 is the most abundant Claudin in spleen from mice infected with Trypanosoma congolense. In mice prone to anaemia (C57BL/6), its expression is reduced compared to strains which display a less severe anaemic response (A/J and BALB/c) and is differentially regulated in spleen during disease progression. Genes clustering with Cldn13 on microarrays are key regulators of erythropoiesis (Tal1, Trim10, E2f2), erythrocyte membrane proteins (Rhd and Gypa), associated with red cell volume (Tmcc2) and indirectly associated with erythropoietic pathways (Cdca8, Cdkn2d, Cenpk). Relationships between genes appearing co-ordinately regulated with Cldn13 post-infection suggest new insights into the molecular regulation and pathways involved in stress induced erythropoiesis and suggest a novel, previously unreported role for claudins in correct cell polarisation and protein partitioning prior to erythroblast enucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2067788144,"The Lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (LYL1) gene is a proto-oncogenic transcription factor found upregulated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-cell ALL). Initially, the upregulation was described to be as a result of a translocation. However, further studies revealed that transcriptional upregulation of LYL1could also occur without translocations. In addition, post-translational mechanisms, such as protein degradation could influence LYL1 expression as well.In this study, we considered possible post-translational regulation of Lyl1, and investigated fundamental mechanisms governing LYL1 degradation in cell-based culture assays. We identify a PEST sequence motif located in the N-terminus of LYL1, which determines the efficiency of LYL1 degradation by the proteasome. The absence of the PEST degradation site leads to accumulation or upregulation of LYL1. We also show that LYL1 is phosphorylated by MAPK at S36, and determined that proteasomal degradation of LYL1 occurs in a phosphorylation-independent manner.Understanding LYL1 degradation is a step forward not only towards deciphering the normal function and regulation of LYL1, but could suggest post-translational mechanisms for upregulation of LYL1 that may contribute to its oncogenic role."
https://openalex.org/W2008409615,"Will Asia be a strong science partner in the 21st century? Our future depends on solving critical problems, many of which require scientific or technical solutions. Asia, which contains two-thirds of the world's population, should be a source of considerable talent for tackling these problems. It has the advantage of geographic size, a youthful population, and increasing wealth. Scholarly activity has been widely respected in Asian cultures throughout their history. Over 400,000 Asian students enrolled in U.S. universities come from Asia (1). In the past, many of these students remained in the United States, but recently an increasing number are returning to their homelands. In response, several Asian countries are attempting to build fundamental research establishments to accommodate these returnees and to increase science capacity (2)."
