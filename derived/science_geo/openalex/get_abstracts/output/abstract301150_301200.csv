https://openalex.org/W1989038475,"On 21 July 1969, during the first manned lunar mission, Apollo 11, the first retroreflector array was placed on the moon, enabling highly accurate measurements of the Earthmoon separation by means of laser ranging. Lunar laser ranging (LLR) turns the Earthmoon system into a laboratory for a broad range of investigations, including astronomy, lunar science, gravitational physics, geodesy, and geodynamics. Contributions from LLR include the three-orders-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy in the lunar ephemeris, a several-orders-of-magnitude improvement in the measurement of the variations in the moon's rotation, and the verification of the principle of equivalence for massive bodies with unprecedented accuracy. Lunar laser ranging analysis has provided measurements of the Earth's precession, the moon's tidal acceleration, and lunar rotational dissipation. These scientific results, current technological developments, and prospects for the future are discussed here."
https://openalex.org/W1991901726,"Sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) released by the explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo on 15 June 1991 had an impact on climate and stratospheric ozone. The total mass of SO(2) released was much greater than the amount dissolved in the magma before the eruption, and thus an additional source for the excess SO(2) is required. Infrared spectroscopic analyses of dissolved water and carbon dioxide in glass inclusions from quartz phenocrysts demonstrate that before eruption the magma contained a separate, SO(2)-bearing vapor phase. Data for gas emissions from other volcanoes in subduction-related arcs suggest that preeruptive magmatic vapor is a major source of the SO(2) that is released during many volcanic eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W2139759683,"The rubbing of a polymer layer, a commonly applied process, leads to an anisotropic surface morphology, aligning liquid crystal molecules. Scanning force microscopy can be used to intentionally create areas with a similar anisotropy by operating the instrument at loads in the range of 10(-7) to 10(-5) newtons. These areas have an orientation effect on liquid crystals indistinguishable from the rubbing process, which allows a systematic investigation of the orientation properties of an alignment layer as a function of its nanometer-scale morphology. Refractive index patterns can be tailored with this method by scratching a suitable area, as demonstrated by fabrication of an optical waveguide 6 micrometers wide and 5 millimeters long."
https://openalex.org/W2017834426,"The scanning tunneling microscope has been used to define regular crystalline structures at room temperature by removing atoms from the silicon (001) surface. A single atomic layer can be removed to define features one atom deep and create trenches with ordered floors. Segments of individual dimer rows can be removed to create structures with atomically straight edges and with lateral features as small as one dimer wide. Conditions under which such removal is possible are defined, and a mechanism is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2060156214,"A soft x-ray laser (wavelength lambda = 15.5 nanometers) was used to create a moir√© deflectogram of a high-density, laser-produced plasma. The use of deflectometry at this short wavelength permits measurement of the density spatial profile in a long-scalelength (3 millimeters), high-density plasma. A peak density of 3.2 x 10(21) per cubic centimeter was recorded."
https://openalex.org/W2071477980,"Kaolinitic claystones in Paleozoic paleokarst underlying the Middle Pennsylvanian Fort Scott Limestone near Drake, Missouri, contain abundant fossil root traces. These include a surficial root mat as well as stout, woody, deeply penetrating root traces: a rooting pattern similar to that under rain forest. Also similar to soils of rain forest is the deeply weathered clay of the paleosol, in which minimal amounts of nutrient bases remain. Forest communities adapted to oligotrophic clayey substrates in humid climates existed at least 305 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2095275928,"Structural transformations on elemental semiconductor surfaces typically occur above several hundred degrees Celsius, and the atomic motions involved are extremely rapid and difficult to observe. However, on the (111) surface of germanium, a few lead atoms catalyze atomic motions so that they can be observed with a tunneling microscope at temperatures below 80 degrees C. Mass transport and structural changes are caused by the creation and propagation of both vacancy-like and interstitial-like point defects within the crystal surface. The availability of dangling bonds on the surface is critical. A detailed atomic model for the observed motions has been developed and is used to explain the structural phase transition Ge(111)-c(2x8) <--> 1x1, which occurs near 300 degrees C."

TO SHOW THAT FOLLOWING THE RULES OF RESEARCH IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY OF FINDING WHAT IS WRONG (OR RIGHT) WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM, SOME EXPERIENCES IN RESEARCH ARE PRESENTED: THE USE OF A TRAFFIC NUMBER (QUALITY OF TRAFFIC FLOW INDEX) CAN BE A CRITERION FOR EVALUATING THE EFFICIENCY OF TRAFFIC OPERATIONS; STUDIES OF DRIVING BEHAVIOR IN ON-THE-ROAD DRIVING TESTS SHOW THAT DRIVERS WITH DIFFERENT DRIVING HISTORIES EXHIBIT MEASURABLY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS WHEN TESTED ON THE SAME ROUTE; AND A HIGHWAY CHARACTERISTICS RECORDER WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO BRING THE INTO THE OFFICE FOR QUICK AND COMPLETE ANALYSIS. THE ABILITY TO MEASURE LEADS TO NEW IDEAS FOR RESEARCH METHODS. WHEN RESEARCHERS START TESTING DRIVING ABILITY, DETERMINING THE QUALITY OF TRAFFIC FLOW, AND REALLY KNOWING THE HIGHWAYS, THERE WILL BE SAFER, MORE EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION."
