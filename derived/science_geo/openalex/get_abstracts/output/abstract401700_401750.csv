https://openalex.org/W2136086666,"Expression of the STAT3 transcription factor in the heart is cardioprotective and decreases the levels of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies indicate that a pool of STAT3 resides in the mitochondria where it is necessary for the maximal activity of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain. However, it has not been explored whether mitochondrial STAT3 modulates cardiac function under conditions of stress. Transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of mitochondria-targeted STAT3 with a mutation in the DNA-binding domain (MLS-STAT3E) were generated. We evaluated the role of mitochondrial STAT3 in the preservation of mitochondrial function during ischemia. Under conditions of ischemia heart mitochondria expressing MLS-STAT3E exhibited modest decreases in basal activities of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain. In contrast to WT hearts, complex I-dependent respiratory rates were protected against ischemic damage in MLS-STAT3E hearts. MLS-STAT3E prevented the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol during ischemia. In contrast to WT mitochondria, ischemia did not augment reactive oxygen species production in MLS-STAT3E mitochondria likely due to an MLS-STAT3E-mediated partial blockade of electron transport through complex I. Given the caveat of STAT3 overexpression, these results suggest a novel protective mechanism mediated by mitochondrial STAT3 that is independent of its canonical activity as a nuclear transcription factor.

https://openalex.org/W2005458361,"Plant genomes are complex and contain large amounts of repetitive DNA including microsatellites that are distributed across entire genomes. Whole genome sequences of several monocot and dicot plants that are available in the public domain provide an opportunity to study the origin, distribution and evolution of microsatellites, and also facilitate the development of new molecular markers. In the present investigation, a genome-wide analysis of microsatellite distribution in monocots (Brachypodium, sorghum and rice) and dicots (Arabidopsis, Medicago and Populus) was performed. A total of 797,863 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified in the whole genome sequences of six plant species. Characterization of these SSRs revealed that mono-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant repeats, and that the frequency of repeats decreased with increase in motif length both in monocots and dicots. However, the frequency of SSRs was higher in dicots than in monocots both for nuclear and chloroplast genomes. Interestingly, GC-rich repeats were the dominant repeats only in monocots, with the majority of them being present in the coding region. These coding GC-rich repeats were found to be involved in different biological processes, predominantly binding activities. In addition, a set of 22,879 SSR markers that were validated by e-PCR were developed and mapped on different chromosomes in Brachypodium for the first time, with a frequency of 101 SSR markers per Mb. Experimental validation of 55 markers showed successful amplification of 80% SSR markers in 16 Brachypodium accessions. An online database ‘BraMi’ (Brachypodium microsatellite markers) of these genome-wide SSR markers was developed and made available in the public domain. The observed differential patterns of SSR marker distribution would be useful for studying microsatellite evolution in a monocot–dicot system. SSR markers developed in this study would be helpful for genomic studies in Brachypodium and related grass species, especially for the map based cloning of the candidate gene(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2084152213,"Angiogenesis is heavily influenced by VEGF-A and its family of receptors, particularly VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2). Like most cell surface proteins, VEGF-R2 is glycosylated, although the function of VEGF-R2 with respect to its glycosylation pattern is poorly characterized. Galectin-3, a glycan binding protein, interacts with the EGF and TGFβ receptors, retaining them on the plasma membrane and altering their signal transduction. Because VEGF-R2 is glycosylated and both galectin-3 and VEGF-R2 are involved with angiogenesis, we hypothesized that galectin-3 binds VEGF-R2 and modulates its signal transduction as well. Employing a Western blot analysis approach, we found that galectin-3 induces phosphorylation of VEGF-R2 in endothelial cells. Knockdown of galectin-3 and Mgat5, an enzyme that synthesizes high-affinity glycan ligands of galectin-3, reduced VEGF-A mediated angiogenesis in vitro. A direct interaction on the plasma membrane was detected between galectin-3 and VEGF-R2, and this interaction was dependent on the expression of Mgat5. Using immunofluorescence and cell surface labeling, we found an increase in the level of internalized VEGF-R2 in both Mgat5 and galectin-3 knockdown cells, suggesting that galectin-3 retains the receptor on the plasma membrane. Finally, we observed reduced suture-induced neovascularization in the corneas of Gal3(-/-) and Mgat5(-/-) mice. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, like its role with the EGF and TGFβ receptors, galectin-3 contributes to the plasma membrane retention and proangiogenic function of VEGF-R2."
https://openalex.org/W1974033361,"Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of cellular extrinsic factors in the aging of adult stem cells. However, the effects of an aged cell–extrinsic environment on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) aging and the factors involved remain unclear. In the current study, we examine the effects of old rat serum (ORS) on the aging of MSCs, and explore the effects and mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on MSC aging induced by ORS treatment. Senescence-associated changes in the cells are examined with SA-β-galactosidase staining and ROS staining. The proliferation ability is detected by MTT assay. The surviving and apoptotic cells are determined using AO/EB staining. The results suggest that ORS promotes MSC senescence and reduces the proliferation and survival of cells. The immunofluorescence staining shows that the expression of β-catenin increases in MSCs of old rats. To identify the effects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on MSC aging induced with ORS, the expression of β-catenin, GSK-3β, and c-myc are detected. The results show that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the cells is activated after ORS treatment. Then we examine the aging, proliferation, and survival of MSCs after modulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The results indicate that the senescence and dysfunction of MSCs in the medium containing ORS is reversed by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor DKK1 or by β-catenin siRNA. Moreover, the expression of γ-H2A.X, a molecular marker of DNA damage response, p16INK4a, p53, and p21 is increased in senescent MSCs induced with ORS, and is also reversed by DKK1 or by β-catenin siRNA. In summary, our study indicates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling may play a critical role in MSC aging induced by the serum of aged animals and suggests that the DNA damage response and p53/p21 pathway may be the main mediators of MSC aging induced by excessive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2064441872,"Endometrial regeneration is mediated, at least in part, by the existence of a specialized somatic stem cell (SSC) population recently identified by several groups using the side population (SP) technique. We previously demonstrated that endometrial SP displays genotypic, phenotypic and the functional capability to develop human endometrium after subcutaneous injection in NOD-SCID mice. We have now established seven human endometrial SP (hESP) cell lines (ICE 1–7): four from the epithelial and three from the stromal fraction, respectively. SP cell lines were generated under hypoxic conditions based on their cloning efficiency ability, cultured for 12–15 passages (20 weeks) and cryopreserved. Cell lines displayed normal 46XX karyotype, intermediate telomerase activity pattern and expressed mRNAs encoding proteins that are considered characteristic of undifferentiated cells (Oct-4, GDF3, DNMT3B, Nanog, GABR3) and those of mesodermal origin (WT1, Cardiac Actin, Enolase, Globin, REN). Phenotype analysis corroborated their epithelial (CD9+) or stromal (vimentin+) cell origin and mesenchymal (CD90+, CD73+ and CD45−) attributes. Markers considered characteristic of ectoderm or endoderm were not detected. Cells did not express either estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) or progesterone receptor (PR). The hESP cell lines were able to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes and osteocytes, which confirmed their mesenchymal origin. Finally, we demonstrated their ability to generate human endometrium when transplanted beneath the renal capsule of NOD-SCID mice. These findings confirm that SP cells exhibit key features of human endometrial SSC and open up new possibilities for the understanding of gynecological disorders such as endometriosis or Asherman syndrome. Our cell lines can be a valuable model to investigate new targets for endometrium proliferation in endometriosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016567163,"We propose the hypothesis that loss of estrogen receptor function which leads to endocrine resistance in breast cancer, also results in trans-differentiation from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype that is responsible for increased aggressiveness and metastatic propensity. siRNA mediated silencing of the estrogen receptor in MCF7 breast cancer cells resulted in estrogen/tamoxifen resistant cells (pII) with altered morphology, increased motility with rearrangement and switch from a keratin/actin to a vimentin based cytoskeleton, and ability to invade simulated components of the extracellular matrix. Phenotypic profiling using an Affymetrix Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 GeneChip indicated geometric fold changes ≥ 3 in approximately 2500 identifiable unique sequences, with about 1270 of these being up-regulated in pII cells. Changes were associated with genes whose products are involved in cell motility, loss of cellular adhesion and interaction with the extracellular matrix. Selective analysis of the data also showed a shift from luminal to basal cell markers and increased expression of a wide spectrum of genes normally associated with mesenchymal characteristics, with consequent loss of epithelial specific markers. Over-expression of several peptide growth factors and their receptors are indicative of an increased contribution to the higher proliferative rates of pII cells as well as aiding their potential for metastatic activity. Signalling molecules that have been identified as key transcriptional drivers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition were also found to be elevated in pII cells. These data support our hypothesis that induced loss of estrogen receptor in previously estrogen/antiestrogen sensitive cells is a trigger for the concomitant loss of endocrine dependence and onset of a series of possibly parallel events that changes the cell from an epithelial to a mesenchymal type. Inhibition of this transition through targeting of specific mediators may offer a useful supplementary strategy to circumvent the effects of loss of endocrine sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1984989438,"Glutamate released by activated microglia induces excitotoxic neuronal death, which likely contributes to non-cell autonomous neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Although both blockade of glutamate receptors and inhibition of microglial activation are the therapeutic candidates for these neurodegenerative diseases, glutamate receptor blockers also perturbed physiological and essential glutamate signals, and inhibitors of microglial activation suppressed both neurotoxic/neuroprotective roles of microglia and hardly affected disease progression. We previously demonstrated that activated microglia release a large amount of glutamate specifically through gap junction hemichannel. Hence, blockade of gap junction hemichannel may be potentially beneficial in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.In this study, we generated a novel blood-brain barrier permeable gap junction hemichannel blocker based on glycyrrhetinic acid. We found that pharmacologic blockade of gap junction hemichannel inhibited excessive glutamate release from activated microglia in vitro and in vivo without producing notable toxicity. Blocking gap junction hemichannel significantly suppressed neuronal loss of the spinal cord and extended survival in transgenic mice carrying human superoxide dismutase 1 with G93A or G37R mutation as an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model. Moreover, blockade of gap junction hemichannel also significantly improved memory impairments without altering amyloid β deposition in double transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein with K595N and M596L mutations and presenilin 1 with A264E mutation as an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.Our results suggest that gap junction hemichannel blockers may represent a new therapeutic strategy to target neurotoxic microglia specifically and prevent microglia-mediated neuronal death in various neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2039546066,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis exhibits differential progression from the time of diagnosis but the molecular basis for varying progression rates is poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether differential miRNA expression might provide one explanation for rapidly versus slowly progressing forms of IPF. Methodology and Principal Findings miRNA and mRNA were isolated from surgical lung biopsies from IPF patients with a clinically documented rapid or slow course of disease over the first year after diagnosis. A quantitative PCR miRNA array containing 88 of the most abundant miRNA in the human genome was used to profile lung biopsies from 9 patients with rapidly progressing IPF, 6 patients with slowly progressing IPF, and 10 normal lung biopsies. Using this approach, 11 miRNA were significantly increased and 36 were significantly decreased in rapid biopsies compared with normal biopsies. Slowly progressive biopsies exhibited 4 significantly increased miRNA and 36 significantly decreased miRNA compared with normal lung. Among the miRNA present in IPF with validated mRNA targets were those with regulatory effects on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Five miRNA (miR-302c, miR-423-5p, miR-210, miR-376c, and miR-185) were significantly increased in rapid compared with slow IPF lung biopsies. Additional analyses of rapid biopsies and fibroblasts grown from the same biopsies revealed that the expression of AGO1 and AGO2 (essential components of the miRNA processing RISC complex) were lower compared with either slow or normal lung biopsies and fibroblasts. Conclusion These findings suggest that the development and/or clinical progression of IPF might be the consequence of aberrant miRNA processing."

Antisense and sense non-coding RNAs have been respectively implicated in initiation and maintenance of FLC repression by vernalization. We show that the promoter and first exon of the FLC gene are sufficient to initiate repression during vernalization; this initial repression of FLC does not require antisense transcription. Long-term maintenance of FLC repression requires additional regions of the gene body, including those encoding sense non-coding transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1971128969,"p62/SQSTM1/A170 is a multimodular protein that is found in ubiquitin-positive inclusions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Recent findings indicate that p62 mediates the interaction between ubiquitinated proteins and autophagosomes, leading these proteins to be degraded via the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. This ubiquitin-mediated selective autophagy is thought to begin with recognition of the ubiquitinated proteins by the C-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain of p62. We present here the crystal structure of the UBA domain of mouse p62 and the solution structure of its ubiquitin-bound form. The p62 UBA domain adopts a novel dimeric structure in crystals, which is distinctive from those of other UBA domains. NMR analyses reveal that in solution the domain exists in equilibrium between the dimer and monomer forms, and binding ubiquitin shifts the equilibrium toward the monomer to form a 1:1 complex between the UBA domain and ubiquitin. The dimer-to-monomer transition is associated with a structural change of the very C-terminal end of the p62 UBA domain, although the UBA fold itself is essentially maintained. Our data illustrate that dimerization and ubiquitin binding of the p62 UBA domain are incompatible with each other. These observations reveal an autoinhibitory mechanism in the p62 UBA domain and suggest that autoinhibition plays a role in the function of p62. p62/SQSTM1/A170 is a multimodular protein that is found in ubiquitin-positive inclusions associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is one of major causes of ubiquitin-positive inclusions found in various neurodegenerative diseases (1Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified the involvement of another degradation system, the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, in the formation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions as exemplified by the observation that autophagy-deficient mice exhibit substantial accumulation of such inclusions in tissues (2Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T. Mizushima N. Iwata J. Ezaki J. Murata S. Hamazaki J. Nishito Y. Iemura S. Natsume T. Yanagawa T. Uwayama J. Warabi E. Yoshida H. Ishii T. Kobayashi A.

Accumulating evidence indicates that p62 is a receptor for ubiquitinated proteins that are targeted to the autophagosome for lysosomal degradation. Specifically, it is involved in autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria, midbody rings, peroxisomes, and microbes (6Kim P.K. Hailey D.W. Mullen R.T. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The importance of p62 in autophagic degradation of proteins and organelles has been demonstrated by studies using tissue-specific autophagy-deficient mice. Elimination of Atg5 or Atg7, an essential gene in the formation of the autophagosome, in mouse neurons and hepatocytes resulted in toxicity accompanied by accumulation of ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the cells. In contrast, knock-out of both Atg7 and p62 (Atg7−/−/p62−/−) caused a dramatic reduction in the amount of inclusions in both types of cells (2Komatsu M. Waguri S. Koike M. Sou Y.S. Ueno T. Hara T.

These observations indicate that p62 is critically involved in the development of ubiquitin-positive inclusions that should be degraded via autophagy. In addition to playing a role in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, p62 itself was identified as a specific substrate degraded by the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (13Bj⊘rk⊘y G. Lamark T. Brech A.

The interaction of p62 with TRAF6 promotes its oligomerization and subsequent activation, which leads to Lys63 polyubiquitination of TRAF6 resulting in the activation of NF-κB activation. Death receptor ligation induces polyubiquitination of caspase-8 through the interaction of DISC with a cullin3-based ubiquitin ligase. p62 promotes aggregation of CUL3-modified caspase-8 within p62-dependent foci, leading to full activation and processing of the enzyme and driving commitment to cell death (5Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Cell. 2009; 137: 1001-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Because p62 levels can be regulated through degradation by autophagy, cellular signals interacting with p62 may also be affected by autophagy. A likely scenario of ubiquitin-mediated “selective autophagy” includes the following: p62 interacts with ubiquitinated proteins, leading to the formation of protein aggregates that are recruited to autophagosomes via interaction with LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3), a mammalian homologue of Atg8. LC3 has been shown to localize to the isolation membrane/phagophore and mediate binding of protein aggregates to the autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with the lysosome/vacuole, and the ubiquitinated cargo is degraded.

In the accepted mechanism, the UBA domain captures ubiquitinated proteins, and the PB1 (Phox and Bem1p) domain at the N terminus of p62 induces formation of protein aggregates through its self-oligomerizing nature. The aggregates are subsequently recruited to the autophagosome for degradation via the interaction between the LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence of p62 and LC3 at the isolation membrane (14Pankiv S.

We present here the crystal structure of the UBA domain of mouse p62 and the solution structure of its ubiquitin-bound form together with biochemical and biophysical data, which, as a whole, reveals a novel ubiquitin-interaction mode of the UBA domain. The p62 UBA domain crystallized as a dimer and exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. Although several UBA dimers have been reported (19Prag G. Misra S. Jones E.A. Ghirlando R.

NMR data reveal that the binding mode between the p62 UBA domain and ubiquitin is similar to that seen in canonical UBA domains. However, only the monomeric p62 UBA domain is observed to bind ubiquitin. Structural comparison of the ubiquitin-free dimer and the ubiquitin-bound monomer of the p62 UBA domain indicates that the ubiquitin-bound form is unable to dimerize due to steric hindrance between the C-terminal tail of the p62 UBA domain and ubiquitin. The C-terminal tail is essential for dimer formation but dispensable for ubiquitin binding. Truncation of the tail dramatically enhances the apparent affinity of the p62 UBA domain for ubiquitin, presumably because of the absence of the monomer-dimer equilibrium that competes with ubiquitin binding. The existence of the monomer-dimer equilibrium may provide a regulatory process for the p62/ubiquitin interaction. The expression vector pGEX-6P1-p62 UBA (residues 391–438 of mouse p62 protein) was constructed using PCR. An oligonucleotide coding for the UBA domain of p62 with 5′ BamHI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites was ligated to the corresponding restriction sites in pGEX-6P1. All mutants of the p62 UBA domain, pGEX-6P1-p62 PB1 (residues 1–100) and PB1 mutants (DDD: D69A, D71A, and D73A and KRK: K7A, R68A, and K91A) were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from the vectors pGEX-6P1-p62 UBA or pGEX-6P1-full-length p62 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the protein samples of the UBA domain and the PB1 domain, including mutants of mouse p62, were expressed as fusion proteins with GST in Escherichia coli. After purification by glutathione-Sepharose 4FF (GE Healthcare) column chromatography, the affinity tag was removed from the proteins using PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). The UBA and PB1 domains were further purified using HiLoad Superdex 75 pg 16/60 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography. The 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled samples were obtained by growing cells in M9 minimal media containing 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose/15NH4Cl, respectively. The selenomethionine derivative of the p62 UBA domain was obtained using Le master medium. Crystals were obtained using the a vapor diffusion hanging drop method with 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, and 1.8 m ammonium sulfate. This crystallization condition was applied to obtain crystals of the selenomethionine derivative of the p62 UBA domain. Protein stock concentration was 20 mg/ml for native crystal and 2 mg/ml for the selenomethionine derivative. Crystals grew in 1–3 days at 20 °C. For diffraction data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by addition of 20% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data of the p62 UBA were collected on an ADSC Quantum 315 detector (Area Detector System Corp., Poway, CA) at the beamline BL-5 at Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Data processing and scaling were performed with the program HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar).

For the dilution experiment of the p62 UBA domain, the protein sample was sequentially diluted 2-fold from 200 to 3.1 μm. For all other 1H-15N HSQC spectra, 100 μm protein samples were used except for the ubiquitin-binding experiment at low concentrations (10 μm). The normalized chemical shift changes for each of the spectra were defined by (δH2 + (δN/5)2)1/2, where δH and δN represent the chemical shift differences in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. For backbone chemical shift assignments of the p62 UBA domain in various states, the 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts of the p62 UBA domain under normal (free form, dimer), 6-equimolar ubiquitin (bound form, monomer), and 35% DMSO (free monomer) conditions were assigned using three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments. All spectra were acquired using either 1 mm (free form), 400 μm (bound form), or 400 μm (35% DMSO) 13C/15N-labeled p62 UBA. Data were processed using the program NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the program CARA (29Rochus K. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. Cantina Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). All the spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance II 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI Cryoprobe head at 292 K. We assigned the chemical shifts of the p62 UBA domain under the 6-equimolar amount of ubiquitin using three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HBHA(CO)NH, H(CCCO)NH, CC(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra of a 400 μm 13C/15N-labeled sample that was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% D2O. The inter-proton distances used for the structural calculation of the p62 UBA domain were derived from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Any intermolecular NOESY cross-peaks were not observed in the intermolecular 13C-filtered NOESY spectra. The structure was calculated using the program CYANA (30Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) based on NOESY cross-peaks either manually picked using the program SPARKY or automatically (iteratively with the structural calculation) picked by ATNOS/CANDID modules in the program UNIO '08 (31Herrmann T.

Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Essentially, the same conformation of the p62 UBA domain structure was obtained using both calculation methods (backbone r.m.s.d. 0.89 Å through residues 394–438 of the mean structures). The final structural ensemble was calculated using the manually picked NOESY cross-peaks, which resulted in more converged structures (backbone r.m.s.d. was 0.54 ± 0.10 Å for the UNIO '08 ATNOS/CYANA structures and 0.13 ± 0.03 Å for the SPARKY/CYANA structure).

Open table in a new tab RDC samples were prepared as described (33Chou J.J. Gaemers S. Howder B. Louis J.M. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The 13C, 15N-lableled wild-type p62 UBA complex with ubiquitin was soaked in a cylindrically shaped 4% polyacrylamide gel, initially 6 × 9 mm in size, which was subsequently radially compressed to fit within an NMR tube, thereby increasing its length to 18 mm. 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings were obtained from IPAP-[1H-15N]-HSQC experiments carried out with 13C decoupling (34Wang Y.X. Marquardt J.L. Wingfield P. Stahl S.J. Lee-Huang S. Torchia D. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7385-7386Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) at 298 K. The measurement was repeated three times to calculate uncertainties in the coupling constants. The order parameter for each residue was set to 1.0, respectively. The coupling constants from the helical regions were used. RDC data analysis was performed using REDCAT (35Valafar H. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 167: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter. Protein samples were dissolved in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. ITC buffers and samples were filtered and degassed prior to the experiment. For determination of dimer dissociation constants, 10 μl of either 1 mm (wild type) or 500 μm (W414F and I433A) protein samples were injected at 5-min intervals to the blank buffer in the 1.4-ml cell. For the determination of ubiquitin-binding constants, 10 μl of 2 mm ubiquitin sample was titrated to the cell containing 30 μm p62 UBA (wild type, W414F, and I433A) with the same experimental setup as for the dimer dissociation experiments. Injections were performed until the heat generated became negligible; typically, 24 injections were required for dimer dissociation and ubiquitin binding. Acquired data were integrated, base-line corrected, and analyzed using software provided by the manufacturer (Origin 7, MicroCal Software, Inc.). For each experiment, at least two independent titration experiments were performed. A polypeptide composed of residues 391–438 of mouse p62 was expressed, prepared, and crystallized. Using these crystals, the structure of the p62 UBA domain was determined at 1.4 Å resolution (Table 1). Two molecules of the p62 UBA domain formed a dimer in one crystallographic asymmetric unit with C2 symmetry (Fig. 1A). The structures of the subunits of an asymmetric unit were almost identical to each other (the r.m.s.d. value for backbone Cα atoms was 0.56 Å). The dimer interface was analyzed by visual inspection and using the program LIGPLOT (36Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4368) Google Scholar). The two p62 UBA subunits are arranged so that helix-2 runs in an anti-parallel manner, and the aromatic ring of Trp414 at the beginning of helix-2 in one unit is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Leu418 in the other unit (Fig. 1B, panel II). The C-terminal part of helix-3 is also involved in the dimer interface, with Ile433 from one unit making hydrophobic contacts with Ile433 from the opposite unit (Fig. 1B, panel I). Helix-1 is not involved in the dimer interface. The surface made of hydrophobic residues in helix-2 and -3 creates a large dimer interface of 667 Å2. Auxiliary electrostatic interactions exist between residue pairs of Met406–Gln434, Arg417–Gly412, and Arg417–Gly413. The electron density terminated at Tyr435 and was not observed for three C-terminal residues, because of structural disorder. The considerable hydrophobicity and complementarity of the dimer interface in the crystal structure imply that the dimer is stable in aqueous solution. To test this assumption, we conducted a series of hydrodynamic studies on the p62 UBA domain (supplemental Table S1). Analytical gel filtration indicates that the estimated apparent molecular weight of wild-type (WT) UBA is two times the predicted molecular weight of monomeric UBA (∼5,800). This result is consistent with those from analytical ultracentrifugation, in which both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments indicate that WT UBA exists as a dimer with an apparent molecular weight of 10,800 ± 600 at a protein concentration of >17 μm, which is approximately two times that of monomeric UBA. To further characterize the p62 UBA domain in solution, we conducted solution NMR experiments. In the 1H-15N correlation spectrum of the 15N-labeled p62 UBA domain (∼1 mm), the number of cross-peaks from main chain amide groups roughly agreed with the number of amino acid residues in the p62 UBA domain. At this concentration, the p62 UBA domain exists mainly as a dimer. Hence, in the spectrum the cross-peaks from each monomer unit are degenerate, indicating that each subunit is in an equivalent environment in a symmetric dimer. These observations are consistent with the crystal structure of the p62 UBA domain, in which the two UBA molecules have a C2 axis of symmetry. To test whether the solution dimer of the UBA domain is the same as that observed in the crystal, we mutated residues that form the dimeric interface in the crystal and observed their effects on dimer formation in solution. Seven mutants were prepared (W414A, W414K, W414F, L418A, L418V, I433A, and I433V). According to analytical gel filtration, the elution volumes indicate that all the mutants except I433V are monomeric at a concentration of 0.1 mm (supplemental Table S1). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the apparent molecular weights of W414F and I433A mutants are 6,500. NMR results combined with results from the hydrodynamic studies suggest that the dimeric structure of the p62 UBA domain in solution is identical to that in the crystal. Interestingly, the 1H-15N correlation spectrum measured at a concentration of ∼1 mm p62 UBA domain contained an additional set of cross-peaks with intensities much weaker than the aforementioned main peak set. We assumed that these weak cross-peaks were due to monomeric p62 UBA domain. To test this assumption, we examined the concentration dependence of the 1H-15N correlation spectrum (Fig. 2, A and B). As the protein concentration decreased, the minor peak set increased in intensity, and the major peak set decreased in intensity. This mutually adverse change in peak intensity upon dilution points to the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium for the p62 UBA domain. The increase in intensity of the minor peaks at lower concentrations indicates that this set of peaks belongs to the monomeric species because dilution shifts the equilibrium toward the monomer. 1H-15N correlation spectra of the six monomeric mutants were also recorded, and these spectra are essentially identical to the minor set of peaks in the WT p62 UBA domain. Comparison of spectral subregions around glycine cross-peaks showed a striking similarity in the spectral pattern between the monomeric mutants and the minor set of peaks of WT p62 UBA (Fig. 2C). These results lead to the conclusion that the minor set of peaks observed in the 1H-15N correlation spectrum of WT p62 UBA belongs to the monomeric form. The equilibrium constant of the dimer dissociation (Kd,dim) was estimated to be in the micromolar range (∼3 μm) using the concentration-dependent change of the cross-peak intensity of the side chain of Trp414 (1Hϵ-15Nϵ cross-peak) (Fig. 2B). The exchange rate between monomer and dimer is slow relative to the NMR time scale, as we did not see any changes in chemical shift as a result of dilution. Previously reported dissociation constants of the complex between ubiquitin and canonical UBAs range from tens to hundreds of micromolars (37Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Hence, a question arises as to whether the ubiquitin interaction affects the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the p62 UBA domain. To examine this, we performed an NMR titration experiment using 15N-labeled p62 UBA and unlabeled ubiquitin. 1H-15N correlation spectra were obtained for samples of 10 μm 15N p62 UBA in the presence of varying amount"
https://openalex.org/W2098142641,"The Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of complement plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after experimental ischemic stroke. As comparable data in human ischemic stroke are limited, we investigated in more detail the association of MBL deficiency with infarction volume and functional outcome in a large cohort of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis or conservative treatment.In a post hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study, admission MBL concentrations were determined in 353 consecutive patients with an acute ischemic stroke of whom 287 and 66 patients received conservative and thrombolytic treatment, respectively. Stroke severity, infarction volume, and functional outcome were studied in relation to MBL concentrations at presentation to the emergency department. MBL levels on admission were not influenced by the time from symptom onset to presentation (p = 0.53). In the conservative treatment group patients with mild strokes at presentation, small infarction volumes or favorable outcomes after three months demonstrated 1.5 to 2.6-fold lower median MBL levels (p = 0.025, p = 0.0027 and p = 0.046, respectively) compared to patients with more severe strokes. Moreover, MBL deficient patients (<100 ng/ml) were subject to a considerably decreased risk of an unfavorable outcome three months after ischemic stroke (adjusted odds ratio 0.38, p<0.05) and showed smaller lesion volumes (mean size 0.6 vs. 18.4 ml, p = 0.0025). In contrast, no association of MBL concentration with infarction volume or functional outcome was found in the thrombolysis group. However, the small sample size limits the significance of this observation.MBL deficiency is associated with smaller cerebral infarcts and favorable outcome in patients receiving conservative treatment. Our data suggest an important role of the lectin pathway in the pathophysiology of cerebral I/R injury and might pave the way for new therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2048277695,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. The expanded CAG repeats are translated into polyglutamine (polyQ), causing aberrant functions as well as aggregate formation of mutant Htt. Effective treatments for HD are yet to be developed.Here, we report a novel dual-function compound, N(6)-(4-hydroxybenzyl)adenine riboside (designated T1-11) which activates the A(2A)R and a major adenosine transporter (ENT1). T1-11 was originally isolated from a Chinese medicinal herb. Molecular modeling analyses showed that T1-11 binds to the adenosine pockets of the A(2A)R and ENT1. Introduction of T1-11 into the striatum significantly enhanced the level of striatal adenosine as determined by a microdialysis technique, demonstrating that T1-11 inhibited adenosine uptake in vivo. A single intraperitoneal injection of T1-11 in wildtype mice, but not in A(2A)R knockout mice, increased cAMP level in the brain. Thus, T1-11 enters the brain and elevates cAMP via activation of the A(2A)R in vivo. Most importantly, addition of T1-11 (0.05 mg/ml) to the drinking water of a transgenic mouse model of HD (R6/2) ameliorated the progressive deterioration in motor coordination, reduced the formation of striatal Htt aggregates, elevated proteasome activity, and increased the level of an important neurotrophic factor (brain derived neurotrophic factor) in the brain. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of T1-11 for treating HD.The dual functions of T1-11 enable T1-11 to effectively activate the adenosinergic system and subsequently delay the progression of HD. This is a novel therapeutic strategy for HD. Similar dual-function drugs aimed at a particular neurotransmitter system as proposed herein may be applicable to other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., the dopamine receptor/dopamine transporter and the serotonin receptor/serotonin transporter) and may facilitate the development of new drugs for other neurodegenerative diseases."

Reference values from North American and European populations are being used for African subjects despite previous studies showing significant differences. Our aim was to establish clinical laboratory reference values for African adolescents and young adults that can be used in clinical trials and for patient management.A panel of 298, HIV-seronegative individuals aged 13-34 years was randomly selected from participants in two population-based cross-sectional surveys assessing HIV prevalence and other sexually transmitted infections in western Kenya. The adolescent (<18 years)-to-adults (≥ 18 years) ratio and the male-to-female ratio was 1∶1. Median and 95% reference ranges were calculated for immunohematological and biochemistry values. Compared with U.S-derived reference ranges, we detected lower hemoglobin (HB), hematocrit (HCT), red blood cells (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), neutrophil, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen values but elevated eosinophil and total bilirubin values. Significant gender variation was observed in hematological parameters in addition to T-bilirubin and creatinine indices in all age groups, AST in the younger and neutrophil, platelet and CD4 indices among the older age group. Age variation was also observed, mainly in hematological parameters among males. Applying U.S. NIH Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity grading to our results, 40% of otherwise healthy study participants were classified as having an abnormal laboratory parameter (grade 1-4) which would exclude them from participating in clinical trials.Hematological and biochemistry reference values from African population differ from those derived from a North American population, showing the need to develop region-specific reference values. Our data also show variations in hematological indices between adolescent and adult males which should be considered when developing reference ranges. This study provides the first locally-derived clinical laboratory reference ranges for adolescents and young adults in western Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W2000685532,"This study was performed to determine whether extracellular silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) production is a genus-wide phenotype associated with all the members of genus Morganella, or only Morganella morganii RP-42 isolate is able to synthesize extracellular Ag nanoparticles. To undertake this study, all the available Morganella isolates were exposed to Ag+ ions, and the obtained nanoproducts were thoroughly analyzed using physico-chemical characterization tools such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-vis), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. It was identified that extracellular biosynthesis of crystalline silver nanoparticles is a unique biochemical character of all the members of genus Morganella, which was found independent of environmental changes. Significantly, the inability of other closely related members of the family Enterobacteriaceae towards AgNPs synthesis strongly suggests that AgNPs synthesis in the presence of Ag+ ions is a phenotypic character that is uniquely associated with genus Morganella."
https://openalex.org/W1994829994,"In addition to its role in virus entry, HIV-1 gp120 has also been implicated in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for gp120-mediated neuroinflammation remain undefined. In view of increased levels of IL-6 in HIV-positive individuals with neurological manifestations, we sought to address whether gp120 is involved in IL-6 over-expression in astrocytes. Transfection of a human astrocyte cell line with a plasmid encoding gp120 resulted in increased expression of IL-6 at the levels of mRNA and protein by 51.3±2.1 and 11.6±2.2 fold respectively; this effect of gp120 on IL-6 expression was also demonstrated using primary human fetal astrocytes. A similar effect on IL-6 expression was observed when primary astrocytes were treated with gp120 protein derived from different strains of X4 and R5 tropic HIV-1. The induction of IL-6 could be abrogated by use of gp120-specific siRNA. Furthermore, this study showed that the NF-κB pathway is involved in gp120-mediated IL-6 over-expression, as IKK-2 and IKKβ inhibitors inhibited IL-6 expression by 56.5% and 60.8%, respectively. These results were also confirmed through the use of NF-κB specific siRNA. We also showed that gp120 could increase the phosphorylation of IκBα. Furthermore, gp120 transfection in the SVGA cells increased translocation of NF-κB from cytoplasm to nucleus. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 gp120-mediated over-expression of IL-6 in astrocytes is one mechanism responsible for neuroinflammation in HIV-infected individuals and this is mediated by the NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2074810060,"Background Influenza epidemics have a substantial impact on human health, by increasing the mortality from pneumonia and influenza, respiratory and circulatory diseases, and all causes. This paper provides estimates of excess mortality rates associated with influenza virus circulation for 7 causes of death and 8 age groups in Portugal during the period of 1980–2004. Methodology/Principal Findings We compiled monthly mortality time series data by age for all-cause mortality, cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic heart diseases, diseases of the respiratory system, chronic respiratory diseases, pneumonia and influenza. We also used a control outcome, deaths from injuries. Age- and cause-specific baseline mortality was modelled by the ARIMA approach; excess deaths attributable to influenza were calculated by subtracting expected deaths from observed deaths during influenza epidemic periods. Influenza was associated with a seasonal average of 24.7 all-cause excess deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, approximately 90% of which were among seniors over 65 yrs. Excess mortality was 3–6 fold higher during seasons dominated by the A(H3N2) subtype than seasons dominated by A(H1N1)/B. High excess mortality impact was also seen in children under the age of four years. Seasonal excess mortality rates from all the studied causes of death were highly correlated with each other (Pearson correlation range, 0.65 to 0.95, P<0.001) and with seasonal rates of influenza-like-illness (ILI) among seniors over 65 years (Pearson correlation rho>0.64, P<0.05). By contrast, there was no correlation with excess mortality from injuries. Conclusions/Significance Our excess mortality approach is specific to influenza virus activity and produces influenza-related mortality rates for Portugal that are similar to those published for other countries. Our results indicate that all-cause excess mortality is a robust indicator of influenza burden in Portugal, and could be used to monitor the impact of influenza epidemics in this country. Additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings in other settings."
https://openalex.org/W1977186726,"Background Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have repeatedly demonstrated regional brain structural abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia, relatively few MRI-based studies have attempted to distinguish between patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls. Method Three-dimensional MR images were acquired from 52 (29 males, 23 females) first-episode schizophrenia patients and 40 (22 males, 18 females) healthy subjects. Multiple brain measures (regional brain volume and cortical thickness) were calculated by a fully automated procedure and were used for group comparison and classification by linear discriminant function analysis. Results Schizophrenia patients showed gray matter volume reductions and cortical thinning in various brain regions predominantly in prefrontal and temporal cortices compared with controls. The classifiers obtained from 66 subjects of the first group successfully assigned 26 subjects of the second group with accuracy above 80%. Conclusion Our results showed that combinations of automated brain measures successfully differentiated first-episode schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. Such neuroimaging approaches may provide objective biological information adjunct to clinical diagnosis of early schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2016237081,"Despite hVISA infections being associated with vancomycin treatment failure, no previous study has been able to detect a mortality difference between heteroresistant vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) and vancomycin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VSSA) bloodstream infections (BSI).Consecutive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) BSI episodes between 1996 and 2008 were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, treatment and overall mortality at 30 days were extracted from the medical records. All isolates underwent vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (VMIC) testing by broth microdilution and Etest. hVISA was confirmed by population analysis profiling using the area under the curve method (PAP-AUC).401 evaluable MRSA BSI episodes were identified over the 12 years. Of these, 46 (11.5%) and 2 (0.5%) were confirmed as hVISA and VISA by PAP-AUC respectively. hVISA predominantly occurred in ST239-like MRSA isolates with high VMIC (2 mg/L). Compared to VSSA, hVISA was associated with chronic renal failure (p<0.001), device related infections (haemodialysis access) (p<0.001) and previous vancomycin usage (p = 0.004). On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality included age, presence of multiple co-morbidities, principal diagnosis, transit to ICU and severity of illness while infection related surgery and hVISA phenotype were associated with increased survival.The presence of hVISA is dependent on the appropriate interplay between host and pathogen factors. hVISA in ST239 MRSA is an independent predictor of survival. Whether these findings would be replicated across all MRSA clones is unknown and warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W2110627846,"Background Diabetes prevalence and body mass index reflect the nutritional profile of populations but have opposing effects on tuberculosis risk. Interactions between diabetes and BMI could help or hinder TB control in growing, aging, urbanizing populations. Methods and Findings We compiled data describing temporal changes in BMI, diabetes prevalence and population age structure in rural and urban areas for men and women in countries with high (India) and low (Rep. Korea) TB burdens. Using published data on the risks of TB associated with these factors, we calculated expected changes in TB incidence between 1998 and 2008. In India, TB incidence cases would have increased (28% from 1.7 m to 2.1 m) faster than population size (22%) because of adverse effects of aging, urbanization, changing BMI and rising diabetes prevalence, generating an increase in TB incidence per capita of 5.5% in 10 years. In India, general nutritional improvements were offset by a fall in BMI among the majority of men who live in rural areas. The growing prevalence of diabetes in India increased the annual number of TB cases in people with diabetes by 46% between 1998 and 2008. In Korea, by contrast, the number of TB cases increased more slowly (6.1% from 40,200 to 42,800) than population size (14%) because of positive effects of urbanization, increasing BMI and falling diabetes prevalence. Consequently, TB incidence per capita fell by 7.8% in 10 years. Rapid population aging was the most significant adverse effect in Korea. Conclusions Nutritional and demographic changes had stronger adverse effects on TB in high-incidence India than in lower-incidence Korea. The unfavourable effects in both countries can be overcome by early drug treatment but, if left unchecked, could lead to an accelerating rise in TB incidence. The prevention and management of risk factors for TB would reinforce TB control by chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2156016352,"Intracellular symbionts of arthropods have diverse influences on their hosts, and their functions generally appear to be associated with their localization within the host. The effect of localization pattern on the role of a particular symbiont cannot normally be tested since the localization pattern within hosts is generally invariant. However, in Israel, the secondary symbiont Rickettsia is unusual in that it presents two distinct localization patterns throughout development and adulthood in its whitefly host, Bemisia tabaci (B biotype). In the ""scattered"" pattern, Rickettsia is localized throughout the whitefly hemocoel, excluding the bacteriocytes, where the obligate symbiont Portiera aleyrodidarum and some other secondary symbionts are housed. In the ""confined"" pattern, Rickettsia is restricted to the bacteriocytes. We examined the effects of these patterns on Rickettsia densities, association with other symbionts (Portiera and Hamiltonella defensa inside the bacteriocytes) and on the potential for horizontal transmission to the parasitoid wasp, Eretmocerus mundus, while the wasp larvae are developing within the whitefly nymph. Sequences of four Rickettsia genes were found to be identical for both localization patterns, suggesting that they are closely related strains. However, real-time PCR analysis showed very different dynamics for the two localization types. On the first day post-adult emergence, Rickettsia densities were 21 times higher in the ""confined"" pattern vs. ""scattered"" pattern whiteflies. During adulthood, Rickettsia increased in density in the ""scattered"" pattern whiteflies until it reached the ""confined"" pattern Rickettsia density on day 21. No correlation between Rickettsia densities and Hamiltonella or Portiera densities were found for either localization pattern. Using FISH technique, we found Rickettsia in the gut of the parasitoid wasps only when they developed on whiteflies with the ""scattered"" pattern. The results suggest that the localization pattern of a symbiont may influence its dynamics within the host."
https://openalex.org/W2157870467,"Clinically significant radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a common toxicity in patients administered thoracic radiotherapy. Although the molecular etiology is poorly understood, we previously characterized a murine model of RILI in which alterations in lung barrier integrity surfaced as a potentially important pathobiological event and genome-wide lung gene mRNA levels identified dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolic pathway genes. We hypothesized that sphingolipid signaling components serve as modulators and novel therapeutic targets of RILI. Sphingolipid involvement in murine RILI was confirmed by radiation-induced increases in lung expression of sphingosine kinase (SphK) isoforms 1 and 2 and increases in the ratio of ceramide to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and dihydro-S1P (DHS1P) levels in plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue. Mice with a targeted deletion of SphK1 (SphK1–/–) or with reduced expression of S1P receptors (S1PR1+/–, S1PR2–/–, and S1PR3–/–) exhibited marked RILI susceptibility. Finally, studies of 3 potent vascular barrier-protective S1P analogs, FTY720, (S)-FTY720-phosphonate (fTyS), and SEW-2871, identified significant RILI attenuation and radiation-induced gene dysregulation by the phosphonate analog, fTyS (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p., 2×/wk) and to a lesser degree by SEW-2871 (1 mg/kg i.p., 2×/wk), compared with those in controls.

https://openalex.org/W2024091637,"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by absence of intramural ganglion cells along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. The HSCR phenotype is highly variable with respect to gender, length of aganglionosis, familiality and the presence of additional anomalies. By molecular genetic analysis, a minimum of 11 neuro-developmental genes (RET, GDNF, NRTN, SOX10, EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, ZFHX1B, PHOX2B, KIAA1279, TCF4) are known to harbor rare, high-penetrance mutations that confer a large risk to the bearer. In addition, two other genes (RET, NRG1) harbor common, low-penetrance polymorphisms that contribute only partially to risk and can act as genetic modifiers. To broaden this search, we examined whether a set of 67 proven and candidate HSCR genes harbored additional modifier alleles. In this pilot study, we utilized a custom-designed array CGH with ∼33,000 test probes at an average resolution of ∼185 bp to detect gene-sized or smaller copy number variants (CNVs) within these 67 genes in 18 heterogeneous HSCR patients. Using stringent criteria, we identified CNVs at three loci (MAPK10, ZFHX1B, SOX2) that are novel, involve regulatory and coding sequences of neuro-developmental genes, and show association with HSCR in combination with other congenital anomalies. Additional CNVs are observed under relaxed criteria. Our research suggests a role for CNVs in HSCR and, importantly, emphasizes the role of variation in regulatory sequences. A much larger study will be necessary both for replication and for identifying the full spectrum of small CNV effects."
https://openalex.org/W2053726370,"Adiponectin is an adipokine with insulin-sensitising actions in vertebrates. Its receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, are PAQR-type proteins with 7-transmembrane domains and topologies reversed that of GPCR's, i.e. their C-termini are extracellular. We identified three adiponectin receptor homologs in the nematode C. elegans, named paqr-1, paqr-2 and paqr-3. These are differently expressed in the intestine (the main fat-storing tissue), hypodermis, muscles, neurons and secretory tissues, from which they could exert systemic effects. Analysis of mutants revealed that paqr-1 and -2 are novel metabolic regulators in C. elegans and that they act redundantly but independently from paqr-3. paqr-2 is the most important of the three paqr genes: mutants grow poorly, fail to adapt to growth at low temperature, and have a very high fat content with an abnormal enrichment in long (C20) poly-unsaturated fatty acids when combined with the paqr-1 mutation. paqr-2 mutants are also synthetic lethal with mutations in nhr-49, sbp-1 and fat-6, which are C. elegans homologs of nuclear hormone receptors, SREBP and FAT-6 (a Δ9 desaturase), respectively. Like paqr-2, paqr-1 is also synthetic lethal with sbp-1. Mutations in aak-2, the C. elegans homolog of AMPK, or nhr-80, another nuclear hormone receptor gene, suppress the growth phenotype of paqr-2 mutants, probably because they restore the balance between energy expenditure and storage. We conclude that paqr-1 and paqr-2 are receptors that regulate fatty acid metabolism and cold adaptation in C. elegans, that their main function is to promote energy utilization rather than storage, and that PAQR class proteins have regulated metabolism in metazoans for at least 700 million years."
https://openalex.org/W1988669960,"Tumor-derived soluble factors, including soluble HLA molecules, can contribute to cancer immune escape and therefore impact on clinical course of malignant diseases. We previously reported that melanoma cells produce, in vitro, soluble forms of the non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E (sHLA-E). In order to investigate sHLA-E production by various tumors and to address its potential value as a tumor-associated marker, we developed a specific ELISA for the quantification of sHLA-E in biological fluids.We developed a sHLA-E specific and sensitive ELISA and we showed that serum sHLA-E levels were significantly elevated (P<0.01) in melanoma patients (n = 127), compared with healthy donors (n = 94). sHLA-E was also detected in the culture supernatants of a wide variety of tumor cell lines (n = 98) including melanomas, kidney, colorectal and breast cancers. Cytokines regulation of sHLA-E production by tumor cells was also carried out. IFN-γ, IFN-α and TNF-α were found to upregulate sHLA-E production by tumor cells.In view of the broad tumor tissue release of HLA-E and its up-regulation by inflammatory cytokines, sHLA-E should be studied for its involvement in immune responses against tumors. Interestingly, our results demonstrated a positive association between the presence of serum sHLA-E and melanoma. Therefore, the determination of sHLA-E levels, using ELISA approach, may be investigated as a clinical marker in cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2074487057,"Routine screening of lung transplant recipients and hospital patients for respiratory virus infections allowed to identify human rhinovirus (HRV) in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, including immunocompromised hosts chronically infected with the same strain over weeks or months. Phylogenetic analysis of 144 HRV-positive samples showed no apparent correlation between a given viral genotype or species and their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract or lead to protracted infection. By contrast, protracted infections were found almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, thus suggesting that host factors rather than the virus genotype modulate disease outcome, in particular the immune response. Complete genome sequencing of five chronic cases to study rhinovirus genome adaptation showed that the calculated mutation frequency was in the range observed during acute human infections. Analysis of mutation hot spot regions between specimens collected at different times or in different body sites revealed that non-synonymous changes were mostly concentrated in the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2 and VP3, independent of the HRV type. In an immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient infected with the same HRV strain for more than two years, both classical and ultra-deep sequencing of samples collected at different time points in the upper and lower respiratory tracts showed that these virus populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable over the course of infection, except for the last month. Specific signatures were found in the last two lower respiratory tract populations, including changes in the 5'UTR polypyrimidine tract and the VP2 immunogenic site 2. These results highlight for the first time the ability of a given rhinovirus to evolve in the course of a natural infection in immunocompromised patients and complement data obtained from previous experimental inoculation studies in immunocompetent volunteers."
https://openalex.org/W2106164323,"Highly refined surveillance data on the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic are crucial to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of the pandemic. There is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in South America. Here we provide a quantitative description of the age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru.We used daily cases of influenza-like-illness, tests for A/H1N1 influenza virus infections, and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system of Peru's Ministry of Health from May 1 to December 31, 2009. We analyzed the geographic spread of the pandemic waves and their association with the winter school vacation period, demographic factors, and absolute humidity. We also estimated the reproduction number and quantified the association between the winter school vacation period and the age distribution of cases.The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area, and the second peak more geographically widespread. The reproduction number was estimated at 1.6-2.2 for the Lima metropolitan area and 1.3-1.5 in the rest of Peru. We found a significant association between the timing of the school vacation period and changes in the age distribution of cases, while earlier pandemic onset was correlated with large population size. By contrast there was no association between pandemic dynamics and absolute humidity.Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in pandemic patterns across Peru, with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact by age and region. Moreover, the Peru data suggest a hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 driven by large population centers. The higher reproduction number of the first pandemic wave could be explained by high contact rates among school-age children, the age group most affected during this early wave."
https://openalex.org/W2042083484,"Ketamine is a well-known anesthetic agent and a drug of abuse. Despite its widespread use and abuse, little is known about its long-term effects on the central nervous system. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of long-term (1- and 3-month) ketamine administration on learning and memory and associated gene expression levels in the brain. The Morris water maze was used to assess spatial memory and gene expression changes were assayed using Affymetrix Genechips; a focus on the expression of GABAA receptors that mediate a tonic inhibition in the brain, was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Compared with saline controls, there was a decline in learning and memory performance in the ketamine-treated mice. Genechip results showed that 110 genes were up-regulated and 136 genes were down-regulated. An ontology analysis revealed the most significant effects of ketamine were on GABAA receptors. In particular, there was a significant up-regulation of both mRNA and protein levels of the alpha 5 subunit (Gabra5) of the GABAA receptors in the prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, chronic exposure to ketamine impairs working memory in mice, which may be explained at least partly by up-regulation of Gabra5 subunits in the prefrontal cortex."

In the present study, we investigated effects of retinoids on bone resorption in cultured neonatal mouse calvarial bones and their interaction with glucocorticoids (GC). All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), retinol, retinalaldehyde, and 9-cis-retinoic acid stimulated release of 45Ca from calvarial bones. The resorptive effect of ATRA was characterized by mRNA expression of genes associated with osteoclast differentiation, enhanced osteoclast number, and bone matrix degradation. In addition, the RANKL/OPG ratio was increased by ATRA, release of 45Ca stimulated by ATRA was blocked by exogenous OPG, and mRNA expression of genes associated with bone formation was decreased by ATRA. All retinoid acid receptors (RARα/β/γ) were expressed in calvarial bones. Agonists with affinity to all receptor subtypes or specifically to RARα enhanced the release of 45Ca and mRNA expression of Rankl, whereas agonists with affinity to RARβ/γ or RARγ had no effects. Stimulation of Rankl mRNA by ATRA was competitively inhibited by the RARα antagonist GR110. Exposure of calvarial bones to GC inhibited the stimulatory effects of ATRA on 45Ca release and Rankl mRNA and protein expression. This inhibitory effect was reversed by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU 486. Increased Rankl mRNA stimulated by ATRA was also blocked by GC in calvarial bones from mice with a GR mutation that blocks dimerization (GRdim mice). The data suggest that ATRA enhances periosteal bone resorption by increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio via RARα receptors, a response that can be inhibited by monomeric GR.

https://openalex.org/W2165177780,"Circadian clocks coordinate the timing of important biological processes. Interconnected transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops based on a set of clock genes generate and maintain these rhythms with a period of about 24 hours. Many clock proteins undergo circadian cycles of post-translational modifications. Among these modifications, protein phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating activity, stability and intracellular localization of clock components. Several protein kinases were characterized as regulators of the circadian clock. However, the function of protein phosphatases, which balance phosphorylation events, in the mammalian clock mechanism is less well understood. Here, we identify protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) as regulator of period and light-induced resetting of the mammalian circadian clock. Down-regulation of PP1 activity in cells by RNA interference and in vivo by expression of a specific inhibitor in the brain of mice tended to lengthen circadian period. Moreover, reduction of PP1 activity in the brain altered light-mediated clock resetting behavior in mice, enhancing the phase shifts in either direction. At the molecular level, diminished PP1 activity increased nuclear accumulation of the clock component PER2 in neurons. Hence, PP1, may reduce PER2 phosphorylation thereby influencing nuclear localization of this protein. This may at least partially influence period and phase shifting properties of the mammalian circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1966973062,"Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) is considered to be a major candidate antigen for a malaria vaccine. Previous immunoepidemiological studies of naturally acquired immunity to Plasmodium vivax AMA-1 (PvAMA-1) have shown a higher prevalence of specific antibodies to domain II (DII) of AMA-1. In the present study, we confirmed that specific antibody responses from naturally infected individuals were highly reactive to both full-length AMA-1 and DII. Also, we demonstrated a strong association between AMA-1 and DII IgG and IgG subclass responses. We analyzed the primary sequence of PvAMA-1 for B cell linear epitopes co-occurring with intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions (IURs). The B cell epitope comprising the amino acid sequence 290–307 of PvAMA-1 (SASDQPTQYEEEMTDYQK), with the highest prediction scores, was identified in domain II and further selected for chemical synthesis and immunological testing. The antigenicity of the synthetic peptide was identified by serological analysis using sera from P. vivax-infected individuals who were knowingly reactive to the PvAMA-1 ectodomain only, domain II only, or reactive to both antigens. Although the synthetic peptide was recognized by all serum samples specific to domain II, serum with reactivity only to the full-length protein presented 58.3% positivity. Moreover, IgG reactivity against PvAMA-1 and domain II after depletion of specific synthetic peptide antibodies was reduced by 18% and 33% (P = 0.0001 for both), respectively. These results suggest that the linear epitope SASDQPTQYEEEMTDYQK is highly antigenic during natural human infections and is an important antigenic region of the domain II of PvAMA-1, suggesting its possible future use in pre-clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W2007900857,"Candida albicans is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen and causes local and systemic disease in immunocompromised patients. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are pivotal for the clearance of C. albicans from the lung. Activated AMs secrete 5-lipoxygenase-derived leukotrienes (LTs), which in turn enhance phagocytosis and microbicidal activity against a diverse array of pathogens. Our aim was to investigate the role of LTB(4) and LTD(4) in AM antimicrobial functions against C. albicans and the signaling pathways involved. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of LT biosynthesis as well as receptor antagonism reduced phagocytosis of C. albicans when compared with untreated or WT controls. Conversely, exogenous LTs of both classes augmented base-line C. albicans phagocytosis by AMs. Although LTB(4) enhanced mainly mannose receptor-dependent fungal ingestion, LTD(4) enhanced mainly dectin-1 receptor-mediated phagocytosis. LT enhancement of yeast ingestion was dependent on protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) and PI3K but not PKCα and MAPK activation. Both LTs reduced activation of cofilin-1, whereas they enhanced total cellular F-actin; however, LTB(4) accomplished this through the activation of LIM kinases (LIMKs) 1 and 2, whereas LTD(4) did so exclusively via LIMK-2. Finally, both exogenous LTB(4) and LTD(4) enhanced AM fungicidal activity in an NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. Our data identify LTB(4) and LTD(4) as key mediators of innate immunity against C. albicans, which act by both distinct and conserved signaling mechanisms to enhance multiple antimicrobial functions of AMs."

It interacts with and regulates cytokine and growth factor signal transduction, thus influencing development, organ morphogenesis, inflammation, and infection. We found chondroitinase activity in medium conditioned by baculovirus-infected insect cells and identified a novel chondroitinase. Sequence analysis revealed that the enzyme was a truncated form of occlusion-derived virus envelope protein 66 (ODV-E66) of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus. The enzyme was a novel chondroitin lyase with distinct substrate specificity. The enzyme was active over a wide range of pH (pH 4-9) and temperature (30-60 °C) and was unaffected by divalent metal ions. The ODV-E66 truncated protein digested chondroitin most efficiently followed by chondroitin 6-sulfate. It degraded hyaluronan to a minimal extent but did not degrade dermatan sulfate, heparin, and N-acetylheparosan. Further analysis using chemo-enzymatically synthesized substrates revealed that the enzyme specifically acted on glucuronate residues in non-sulfated and chondroitin 6-sulfate structures but not in chondroitin 4-sulfate structures. These results suggest that this chondroitinase is useful for detailed structural and compositional analysis of chondroitin sulfate, preparation of specific chondroitin oligosaccharides, and study of baculovirus infection mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2003870614,"Background We tested the hypothesis that 5-Hydroxydecanoic acid (5HD), a putative mitoKATP channel blocker, will reverse sepsis-induced cardiodynamic and adult rat ventricular myocyte (ARVM) contractile dysfunction, restore mitochondrial membrane permeability alterations and improve survival. Methodology/Principal Findings Male Sprague-Dawley rats (350–400 g) were made septic using 400 mg/kg cecal inoculum, ip. Sham animals received 5% dextrose water, ip. The Voltage Dependent Anion Channels (VDAC1), Bax and cytochrome C levels were determined in isolated single ARVMs obtained from sham and septic rat heart. Mitochondria and cytosolic fractions were isolated from ARVMs treated with norepinephrine (NE, 10 µmoles) in the presence/absence of 5HD (100 µmoles). A continuous infusion of 5HD using an Alzet pump reversed sepsis-induced mortality when administered at the time of induction of sepsis (−40%) and at 6 hr post-sepsis (−20%). Electrocardiography revealed that 5HD reversed sepsis-induced decrease in the average ejection fraction, Simpsons+m Mode (53.5±2.5 in sepsis and 69.2±1.2 at 24 hr in sepsis+5HD vs. 79.9±1.5 basal group) and cardiac output (63.3±1.2 mL/min sepsis and 79.3±3.9 mL/min at 24 hr in sepsis+5HD vs. 85.8±1.5 mL/min basal group). The treatment of ARVMs with 5HD also reversed sepsis-induced depressed contractility in both the vehicle and NE-treated groups. Sepsis produced a significant downregulation of VDAC1, and upregulation of Bax levels, along with mitochondrial membrane potential collapse in ARVMs. Pretreatment of septic ARVMs with 5HD blocked a NE-induced decrease in the VDAC1 and release of cytochrome C. Conclusion The data suggest that Bax activation is an upstream event that may precede the opening of the mitoKATP channels in sepsis. We concluded that mitoKATP channel inhibition via decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced release of cytochrome C provided protection against sepsis-induced ARVM and myocardial contractile dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2080345730,"The Lpin1 gene encodes the phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1) enzyme Lipin 1, which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. In this study we describe the identification and characterization of a rat model with a mutated Lpin1 gene (Lpin1(1Hubr)), generated by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. Lpin1(1Hubr) rats are characterized by hindlimb paralysis and mild lipodystrophy that are detectable from the second postnatal week. Sequencing of Lpin1 identified a point mutation in the 5'-end splice site of intron 18 resulting in mis-splicing, a reading frameshift, and a premature stop codon. As this mutation does not induce nonsense-mediated decay, it allows the production of a truncated Lipin 1 protein lacking PAP1 activity. Lpin1(1Hubr) rats developed hypomyelination and mild lipodystrophy rather than the pronounced demyelination and adipocyte defects characteristic of Lpin1(fld/fld) mice, which carry a null allele for Lpin1. Furthermore, biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses revealed that these lesions improve in older Lpin1(1Hubr) rats as compared with young Lpin1(1Hubr) rats and Lpin1(fld/fld) mice. We observed activation of compensatory biochemical pathways substituting for missing PAP1 activity that, in combination with a possible non-enzymatic Lipin 1 function residing outside of its PAP1 domain, may contribute to the less severe phenotypes observed in Lpin1(1Hubr) rats as compared with Lpin1(fld/fld) mice. Although we are cautious in making a direct parallel between the presented rodent model and human disease, our data may provide new insight into the pathogenicity of recently identified human LPIN1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2077332675,"Since RNA interference (RNAi) has the potential to discriminate between single nucleotide changes, there is growing interest in the use of RNAi as a promising therapeutical approach to target dominant disease-associated alleles. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been linked to dominantly inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). We focused on three LRRK2 mutations (R1441G/C and the more prevalent G2109S) hoping to identify shRNAs that would both recognize and efficiently silence the mutated alleles preferentially over the wild-type alleles. Using a luciferase-based reporter system, we identified shRNAs that were able to specifically target the R1441G and R1441C alleles with 80% silencing efficiency. The same shRNAs were able to silence specifically mRNAs encoding either partial or full-length mutant LRRK2 fusion proteins, while having a minimal effect on endogenous wild-type LRRK2 expression when transfected in 293FT cells. Shifting of the mutant recognition site (MRS) from position 11 to other sites (4 and 16, within the 19-mer window of our shRNA design) reduced specificity and overall silencing efficiency. Developing an allele-specific RNAi of G2019S was problematic. Placement of the MRS at position 10 resulted in efficient silencing of reporters (75–80%), but failed to discriminate between mutant and wild-type alleles. Shifting of the MRS to positions 4, 5, 15, 16 increased the specificity of the shRNAs, but reduced the overall silencing efficiency. Consistent with previous reports, these data confirm that MRS placement influences both allele-specificity and silencing strength of shRNAs, while further modification to hairpin design or MRS position may lead to the development of effective G2019S shRNAs. In summary, the effective shRNA against LRRK2 R1441 alleles described herein suggests that RNAi-based therapy of inherited Parkinson's disease is a viable approach towards developing effective therapeutic interventions for this serious neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W2139741260,"Candida albicans is the major fungal pathogen of humans. Its adhesion to host-cell surfaces is the first critical step during mucosal infection. Antimicrobial peptides play important roles in the first line of mucosal immunity against C. albicans infection. LL-37 is the only member of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide family and is commonly expressed in various tissues, including epithelium. We previously showed that LL-37 significantly reduced C. albicans adhesion to plastic, oral epidermoid OECM-1 cells, and urinary bladders of female BALB/c mice. The inhibitory effect of LL-37 on cell adhesion occurred via the binding of LL-37 to cell-wall carbohydrates. Here we showed that formation of LL-37-cell-wall protein complexes potentially inhibits C. albicans adhesion to polystyrene. Using phage display and ELISA, we identified 10 peptide sequences that could bind LL-37. A BLAST search revealed that four sequences in the major C. albicans cell-wall β-1,3-exoglucanase, Xog1p, were highly similar to the consensus sequence derived from the 10 biopanned peptides. One Xog1p-derived peptide, Xog1p(90-115), and recombinant Xog1p associated with LL-37, thereby reversing the inhibitory effect of LL-37 on C. albicans adhesion. LL-37 reduced Xog1p activity and thus interrupted cell-wall remodeling. Moreover, deletion of XOG1 or another β-1,3-exoglucanase-encoding gene EXG2 showed that only when XOG1 was deleted did cellular exoglucanase activity, cell adhesion and LL-37 binding decrease. Antibodies against Xog1p also decreased cell adhesion. These data reveal that Xog1p, originally identified from LL-37 binding, has a role in C. albicans adhesion to polystyrene and, by inference, attach to host cells via direct or indirect manners. Compounds that target Xog1p might find use as drugs that prevent C. albicans infection. Additionally, LL-37 could potentially be used to screen for other cell-wall components involved in fungal cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2083144823,"Respiratory dysfunction is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in aged populations. The susceptibility to pulmonary insults is attributed to ""low pulmonary reserve"", ostensibly reflecting a combination of age-related musculoskeletal, immunologic and intrinsic pulmonary dysfunction.Using a murine model of the aging lung, senescent DBA/2 mice, we correlated a longitudinal survey of airspace size and injury measures with a transcriptome from the aging lung at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 months of age. Morphometric analysis demonstrated a nonlinear pattern of airspace caliber enlargement with a critical transition occurring between 8 and 12 months of age marked by an initial increase in oxidative stress, cell death and elastase activation which is soon followed by inflammatory cell infiltration, immune complex deposition and the onset of airspace enlargement. The temporally correlative transcriptome showed exuberant induction of immunoglobulin genes coincident with airspace enlargement. Immunohistochemistry, ELISA analysis and flow cytometry demonstrated increased immunoglobulin deposition in the lung associated with a contemporaneous increase in activated B-cells expressing high levels of TLR4 (toll receptor 4) and CD86 and macrophages during midlife. These midlife changes culminate in progressive airspace enlargement during late life stages.Our findings establish that a tissue-specific aging program is evident during a presenescent interval which involves early oxidative stress, cell death and elastase activation, followed by B lymphocyte and macrophage expansion/activation. This sequence heralds the progression to overt airspace enlargement in the aged lung. These signature events, during middle age, indicate that early stages of the aging immune system may have important correlates in the maintenance of tissue morphology. We further show that time-course analyses of aging models, when informed by structural surveys, can reveal nonintuitive signatures of organ-specific aging pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2144607660,"The DosR regulon and the Enduring Hypoxic Response (EHR) define a group of M. tuberculosis genes that are specifically induced in bacilli exposed in vitro to conditions thought to mimic the environment encountered by Mycobacteria during latent infection. Although well described in humans, latent mycobacterial infection in cattle remains poorly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify antigens that may potentially disclose cattle with latent M. bovis infection. To this end, we initially screened 57 pools of overlapping peptides representing 4 DosR regulon and 29 EHR antigens for their ability to stimulate an immune response in whole blood from TB-reactor cattle using IFN-γ and IL-2 as readouts. All 4 DosR regulon proteins were poorly recognized (maximum responder frequency of 10%). For the EHR antigens, both IFN-γ and IL-2 revealed similar response hierarchies, with responder frequencies ranging from 54% down to 3% depending on the given EHR antigen. Furthermore, these results demonstrated that responses in the infected cattle were largely IFN-γ biased. To support the concept for their role in latency, we evaluated if EHR antigen responses were associated with lower pathology. The EHR antigen Rv0188 was recognised predominantly in animals presenting with low pathology scores, whereas responses to ESAT-6/CFP-10 or the other EHR antigens tested were prevalent across the pathology spectrum. However, when we determined the production of additional cytokines induced by the M. bovis antigens PPD-B or ESAT-6/CFP-10, we detected significantly greater PPD-B-induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in animals recognizing Rv0188 (i.e. those with limited or no pathology). Thus, these results are consistent with the idea that responses to Rv0188 may identify a subset of animals at early stages of infection or in which disease progression may be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2170737158,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is a zoonotic pathogen that can cause infections in pigs and humans. Bacterial surface proteins are often investigated as potential vaccine candidates and biomarkers of virulence. In this study, a novel method for identifying bacterial surface proteins is presented, which combines immunoproteomic and immunoserologic techniques. Critical to the success of this new method is an improved procedure for generating two-dimensional electrophoresis gel profiles of S. suis proteins. The S. suis surface proteins identified in this study include muramidase-released protein precursor (MRP) and an ABC transporter protein, while MRP is thought to be one of the main virulence factors in SS2 located on the bacterial surface. Herein, we demonstrate that the ABC transporter protein can bind to HEp-2 cells, which strongly suggests that this protein is located on the bacterial cell surface and may be involved in pathogenesis. An immunofluorescence assay confirmed that the ABC transporter is localized to the bacterial outer surface. This new method may prove to be a useful tool for identifying surface proteins, and aid in the development of new vaccine subunits and disease diagnostics."

We investigated the role of sexual transmission of HHV8 in a nationally representative sample in Uganda, where HHV8 infection is endemic and transmitted mostly during childhood.The study population was a subset of participants (n = 2681) from a population-based HIV/AIDS serobehavioral survey of adults aged 15-59 years conducted in 2004/2005. High risk for sexual transmission was assessed by questionnaire and serological testing for HIV and herpes simplex virus 2. Anti-HHV8 antibodies were measured using two enzyme immunoassays targeting synthetic peptides from the K8.1 and orf65 viral genes. The current study was restricted to 2288 sexually active adults. ORs and 95% CIs for HHV8 seropositivity were estimated by fitting logistic regression models with a random intercept using MPLUS and SAS software.The weighted prevalence of HHV8 seropositivity was 56.2%, based on 1302 seropositive individuals, and it increased significantly with age (P(trend)<0.0001). In analyses adjusting for age, sex, geography, education, and HIV status, HHV8 seropositivity was positively associated with reporting two versus one marital union (OR:1.52, 95% CI: 1.17-1.97) and each unit increase in the number of children born (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08), and was inversely associated with ever having used a condom (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45-0.89). HHV8 seropositivity was not associated with HIV (P = 0.660) or with herpes simplex virus 2 (P = 0.732) seropositivity. Other sexual variables, including lifetime number of sexual partners or having had at least one sexually transmitted disease, and socioeconomic variables were unrelated to HHV8 seropositivity.Our findings are compatible with the conclusion that sexual transmission of HHV8 in Uganda, if it occurs, is weak."

https://openalex.org/W1989715546,"Attitudes towards authorship are connected with authors' research experience and with knowledge of authorship criteria of International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). The objective of this study was to assess association between authors' perceived importance of contributions for authorship qualification and their participation in manuscripts submitted to a journal.Authors (n = 1181) of 265 manuscripts submitted to the Croatian Medical Journal were asked to identify and rate their contribution in the preparation of the submitted manuscript (0-none to 4-full for 11 listed contributions) and the importance of these contributions as authorship qualifications (0-none to 4-full). They were randomly allocated into 3 groups: the first (n = 90 manuscripts, n = 404 authors) first received the contribution disclosure form and then contribution importance-rating questionnaire; the second (n = 88 manuscripts, n = 382 authors) first received the rating questionnaire and then the contribution disclosure form, and the third group (n = 87 manuscripts, n = 395 authors) received both questionnaires at the same time. We compared authors' perception of importance of contribution categories.1014 (85.9%) authors of 235 manuscripts responded. Authors who declared contribution to a specific category rated it as more important for authorship than those authors who did not contribute to the same category (P>0.005 for all contribution categories, Mann-Withney test). Authors qualifying for ICMJE authorship rated all contribution categories higher than non-qualifying authors. For all contributions, associations between perceived importance of contribution and actual author's contribution were statistically significant.Authorship seems to be not a normative issue subjective to categorization into criteria, but also a very personal view of the importance and value of one's contributions."
https://openalex.org/W1999163215,"The identification of orthologous genes shared by multiple genomes plays an important role in evolutionary studies and gene functional analyses. Based on a recently developed accurate tool, called MSOAR 2.0, for ortholog assignment between a pair of closely related genomes based on genome rearrangement, we present a new system MultiMSOAR 2.0, to identify ortholog groups among multiple genomes in this paper. In the system, we construct gene families for all the genomes using sequence similarity search and clustering, run MSOAR 2.0 for all pairs of genomes to obtain the pairwise orthology relationship, and partition each gene family into a set of disjoint sets of orthologous genes (called super ortholog groups or SOGs) such that each SOG contains at most one gene from each genome. For each such SOG, we label the leaves of the species tree using 1 or 0 to indicate if the SOG contains a gene from the corresponding species or not. The resulting tree is called a tree of ortholog groups (or TOGs). We then label the internal nodes of each TOG based on the parsimony principle and some biological constraints. Ortholog groups are finally identified from each fully labeled TOG. In comparison with a popular tool MultiParanoid on simulated data, MultiMSOAR 2.0 shows significantly higher prediction accuracy. It also outperforms MultiParanoid, the Roundup multi-ortholog repository and the Ensembl ortholog database in real data experiments using gene symbols as a validation tool. In addition to ortholog group identification, MultiMSOAR 2.0 also provides information about gene births, duplications and losses in evolution, which may be of independent biological interest. Our experiments on simulated data demonstrate that MultiMSOAR 2.0 is able to infer these evolutionary events much more accurately than a well-known software tool Notung. The software MultiMSOAR 2.0 is available to the public for free."
https://openalex.org/W2101639816,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) have been implicated in a wide array of human malignancies, including medulloblastoma (MB), the most common brain tumor of childhood. Although significant progress in MB biology and therapeutics has been achieved during the past decades, MB remains a horrible challenge to the physicians and researchers. Therefore, novel inhibitors targeting PDGFR signaling pathway may offer great promise for the treatment of MB. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity and mechanisms of cambogin in Daoy MB cells. Our results show that cambogin triggers significant S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via down regulation of cyclin A and E, and activation of caspases. More importantly, further mechanistic studies demonstrated that cambogin inhibits PDGFR signaling in Daoy and genetically defined mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines. These results suggest that cambogin is preferentially cytotoxic to cells expressing PDGFR. Our findings may provide a novel approach by targeting PDGFR signaling against MB."
https://openalex.org/W2057165654,"A feature of the Asian Indian phenotype is low birth weight with increased adult type 2 diabetes risk. Most populations show consistent associations between low birth weight and adult type 2 diabetes. Recently, two birth weight-lowering loci on chromosome 3 (near CCNL1 and ADCY5) were identified in a genome-wide association study, the latter of which is also a type 2 diabetes locus. We therefore tested the impact of these genetic variants on birth weight and adult glucose/insulin homeostasis in a large Indian birth cohort.Adults (n = 2,151) enrolled in a birth cohort (established 1969-73) were genotyped for rs900400 (near CCNL1) and rs9883204 (ADCY5). Associations were tested for birth weight, anthropometry from infancy to adulthood, and type 2 diabetes related glycemic traits. The average birth weight in this population was 2.79±0.47 kg and was not associated with genetic variation in CCNL1 (p = 0.87) or ADCY5 (p = 0.54). Allele frequencies for the 'birth weight-lowering' variants were similar compared with Western populations. There were no significant associations with growth or adult weight. However, the 'birth weight-lowering' variant of ADCY5 was associated with modest increase in fasting glucose (β 0.041, p = 0.027), 2-hours glucose (β 0.127, p = 0.019), and reduced insulinogenic index (β -0.106, p = 0.050) and 2-hour insulin (β -0.058, p = 0.010).The low birth weight in Asian Indians is not even partly explained by genetic variants near CCNL1 and ADCY5 which implies that non-genetic factors may predominate. However, the 'birth-weight-lowering' variant of ADCY5 was associated with elevated glucose and decreased insulin response in early adulthood which argues for a common genetic cause of low birth weight and risk of type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2055578519,"Missense mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene can cause familial Alzheimer disease. It is thought that APP and APP-like proteins (APLPs) may play a role in adhesion and signal transduction because their ectodomains interact with components of the extracellular matrix. Heparin binding induces dimerization of APP and APLPs. To help explain how these proteins interact with heparin, we have determined the crystal structure of the E2 domain of APLP1 in complex with sucrose octasulfate (SOS). A total of three SOS molecules are bound to the E2 dimer. Two SOSs are bound inside a narrow intersubdomain groove, and the third SOS is bound near the two-fold axis of the protein. Mutational analyses show that most residues interacting with SOS also contribute to heparin binding, although in varying degrees; a deep pocket, defined by His-376, Lys-422, and Arg-429, and an interfacial site between Lys-314 and its symmetry mate are most important in the binding of the negatively charged polysaccharide. Comparison with a lower resolution APP structure shows that all key heparin binding residues are conserved and identically positioned, suggesting that APLP1 and APP may bind heparin similarly. In transfected HEK-293 cells, mutating residues responsible for heparin binding causes little change in the proteolysis of APP by the secretases. However, mutating a pair of conserved basic residues (equivalent to Arg-414 and Arg-415 of APLP1) immediately adjacent to the heparin binding site affects both the maturation and the processing of APP.

Besides their direct interactions with Aβ, heparin and HS were also known to affect Aβ production itself (30Leveugle B. Ding W. Durkin J.T. Mistretta S. Eisle J. Matic M. Siman R. Greenberg B.D.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Some of the effects of heparin on Aβ production in cell cultures were thought to be due to its binding to β-secretase, which resulted in inhibition of the protease (33Scholefield Z. Yates E.A. Wayne G. Amour A. McDowell W. Turnbull J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whether the binding of heparin and HS to APP might also influence the proteolytic processing of the precursor has not been studied before. To help determine how APP family proteins interact with heparin and HS, we have solved the crystal structure of the E2 domain of APLP1 in complex with sucrose octasulfate (SOS) (see Fig. 1A). The E2 domain contains the higher affinity heparin binding site (19Mok S.S. Sberna G. Heffernan D. Cappai R. Galatis D. Clarris H.J. Sawyer W.H. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Unlike the situation in a previous study (34Hoopes J.T. Liu X. Xu X. Demeler B. Folta-Stogniew E. Li C. Ha Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2165-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the ligand, as well as the protein side chains that interacted with it, has now been clearly defined in the electron density map. The crystal structure, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, permitted the identification of all key heparin binding residues in the E2 domain. We also studied the effects of mutating some of these residues on the proteolytic processing of APP in cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. The sodium salt of SOS was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. The heparin disaccharides were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (H9267 and H9392). Heparin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-203075). The APLP1285–494 fragment was amplified by PCR from human APLP1 cDNA (Open Biosystems, MHS1010-74392) and subcloned into pET28a vector (Novagen). The recombinant protein was expressed in BL21-Gold(DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies) in LB medium. The cells were induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 0.5 and were left to grow overnight at room temperature. The cells were harvested and resuspended in the lysis buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by freeze and thaw in the presence of lysozyme. The cell lysate was applied to a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech), and the recombinant protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was removed by thrombin. The protein without His tag was concentrated and further purified on a Superdex S-200 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The peak fraction was pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. All mutants were generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit. They were expressed and purified similarly. APLP1285–494 was initially crystallized by the hanging-drop method. The reservoir solution contained 25% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 25 mm ATP. Rod-shaped crystals usually showed up overnight and grew to a maximum size of 0.3 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm after 3 days. The crystals were sensitive to exposures to the air and could only be cryo-preserved by Paratone oil with a low success rate, which greatly hindered the soaking experiment. To overcome this problem, we tried other crystallization and cryo-protection methods. The microbatch crystallization method, which allowed all soaking and cryo-preserving steps to be performed under oil, was found to be most suitable for our purpose. We also found that adding glycerol to the mother liquor increased the success rate of cryo-protection. In summary, the 1:1 mixture of protein and crystallization solutions (25% PEG 3350, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 0.2 m Li2SO4, 25 mm ATP) was pipetted into the 72-well microbatch plate immersed with Al's oil (a 1:1 mixture of silicone oil and paraffin oil, Hampton Research). After overnight incubation, streak-seeding was performed to expedite crystallization. After seeding, crystals usually grew to maximum size in 24 h and were ready for soaking. SOS was dissolved in the crystallization solution and added to the drops to reach final concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 50 mm. After overnight soaking, the crystals were cryo-preserved by stepwise exchange of the mother liquor with a crystallization solution supplemented with 25% glycerol. The crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. We also tried to soak the heparin disaccharides into the crystal using a similar protocol. To minimize the potential competition of the sulfate ions and ATP present in the crystallization solution with the ligand, we also lowered the concentrations of Li2SO4 and ATP in the artificial mother liquor. Although ATP was not essential, 20 mm Li2SO4 was required to maintain the diffraction quality of the crystals; however, even at 20 mm Li2SO4 and without ATP, the heparin disaccharides still failed to bind to the protein. X-ray diffraction data were collected from beamlines X25 and X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) and processed by HKL2000 (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38520) Google Scholar). The packing of the PEG crystal form was similar to that of a previous crystal form obtained from phosphate salts (23Gralle M. Oliveira C.L. Guerreiro L.H. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Parker M.W. Ramos C.H. Torriani I. Ferreira S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 493-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For the apo-structure (and those treated with heparin disaccharides), rigid body refinement of the relative positions of the two subdomains by CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) followed by a few steps of positional and temperature factor refinement was sufficient to lower the R from 48% to about 29% (Rfree 33%). For the SOS complex, however, the R after similar refinement remained high (R 32%; Rfree 36%). After manual adjustment of the protein model using O (37Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) based on 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps, the R-factor could be lowered to 29%. The improvement in the accuracy of the phase finally rendered the A site (the SOS binding site in the A chain) interpretable. The streak of positive peaks lying across helix αD in the difference Fourier map, initially thought to be due to another bound SOS molecule, now appeared to correspond to a segment of polypeptide chain near the C terminus of the protein, which was disordered in the apo-structure. After adding the missing segment to the protein model (residues 487–494 of the A chain; see Fig. 1B, red), it became clear that the remaining densities at the A site corresponded a single SOS molecule. Incorporation of the SOS molecules to the model using coot (38Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17049) Google Scholar) caused Rfree to immediately drop another 1.2%, which further confirmed the presence of SOS at the binding sites. Further refinements were carried out using refmac5 (39Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab After exchanging into a buffer of 10 mm sodium phosphate/acetate, pH 7.5, the protein solutions were loaded onto the 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–2 m NaCl). The eluting NaCl concentrations were calculated based on the measured conductivity. HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin on a 6-well tissue culture dish. The human APP751 sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−) expression vector (Invitrogen) with an engineered C-terminal Myc tag. After reaching 70–80% confluency, the cells were transfected with the plasmid (1.5 μg of DNA/well) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (5 μl/well) (Invitrogen). After 36 h, the transfected cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and the Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were resolved by Novex 16% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) and visualized by Western blot using mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (1:500) (Invitrogen) and goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) (Novagen). The mutants were generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit and similarly expressed in HEK-293 cells. The new crystallization condition, which used PEG instead of phosphate salts as precipitant, was ideal for the heparin soaking experiment because the binding of heparin to E2 was inhibited at high salt concentrations. Direct soaking with a longer heparin compound unfortunately disrupted the crystal lattice. We therefore resorted to the shorter heparin disaccharides and SOS, a disaccharide that, like heparin, is heavily substituted with sulfate groups (Fig. 1B). Diffraction data were collected from many crystals that had been soaked either in blank solutions or in solutions containing different concentrations of the disaccharides. Difference Fourier analysis showed that only SOS bound to the protein in the crystal. In the apo-structure, a strong peak (∼8 σ) was observed between Lys-422, Arg-425, and Arg-429, which probably corresponded to a bound sulfate ion from the crystallization solution (which contained 200 mm Li2SO4) and was similar in appearance to the bound phosphate ion in a previously solved structure (Fig. 1C). The sulfate peak was not affected by the soaking of two heparin disaccharides (map not shown). In the difference map of the SOS complex, the strong sulfate peak disappeared, and a cluster of new peaks (∼6 σ), which contained an elongated central peak and eight peaks around it, appeared in a nearby groove between the two subdomains of the B chain of the E2 dimer (the B site; Fig. 1D). Later refinement showed that the peripheral peaks corresponded to the eight sulfate groups of SOS. The difference density features in chain A (the A site) were more complex initially due to rearrangements in the protein structure (see below). The difference map also suggested that there was a third and weaker SOS binding site (the C site) at the interface between the two protein protomers (Fig. 1B). The SOSs bound at the A and B sites were clearly defined in the electron density map (supplemental Fig. S1). Although the ligand was bound to the protein differently, the backbone of the disaccharides had similar conformations (supplemental Fig. S2A); the rotational angles around the two single bonds of the α(1→2) glycosidic linkage were similar so that the two sugar rings were superposable simultaneously. The SOS bound at the interfacial C site also appeared to adopt this conformation, although we were less certain about its modeling due to poor electron densities (supplemental Figs. S1C and S2B). The conformation of the sugar observed here had been observed before in other crystallographic studies of protein-SOS complexes (for example, see Ref. 40Parkash V. Leppänen V.M. Virtanen H. Jurvansuu J.M. Bespalov M.M. Sidorova Y.A. Runeberg-Roos P. Saarma M. Goldman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35164-35172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2C). The binding of SOS to the A site displaced the sulfate ion bound to Lys-422, Arg-425, and Arg-429 in the apo-structure (Fig. 2A). The sulfate group connected to the C2 atom of the glucose (Glc) moiety of SOS now occupied a nearby site and was hydrogen-bonded to Arg-425 and Arg-429. The same sulfate group also formed a hydrogen bond with His-426, whose side chain rotated 60° around the Cα-Cβ bond to move into the binding site. The sulfate group on C3 of the glucose was hydrogen-bonded to His-489, which was part of the C-terminal segment that was disordered in the apo-structure (Fig. 2C). The sulfate on glucose C4 was hydrogen-bonded to Arg-418, whose side chain was also disordered in the apo-structure. The sulfate on glucose C6 was hydrogen-bonded to Arg-418 and Lys-422. The fructose (Fru) moiety of SOS was raised to interact with residues from the N-terminal subdomain of E2. The sulfate on fructose C1 was hydrogen-bonded to His-426 and interacted with Lys-422 and the backbone amide group of His-307 via bridging water molecules. The sulfate on fructose C4 formed a hydrogen bond with Ser-305, and the sulfate on fructose C6 was hydrogen-bonded to Gln-387 and Lys-422. The sulfate on fructose C3 did not appear to engage in any direct interactions with the protein. SOS was bound to the B site in a completely different mode (Fig. 2B). The disaccharide appeared to be flipped by 90°, and most of the interactions with the protein were mediated now through sulfate groups on the fructose moiety. The sulfate group on fructose C1 was hydrogen-bonded to Lys-422* and Arg-429* (the asterisk denotes the B-chain). The sulfate group on fructose C3 penetrated deep into the space between the two subdomains and formed a hydrogen bond with His-376*. The sulfate on fructose C3 also interacted with His-307* via a water molecule. The sulfate on fructose C4 interacted with the backbone amide of His-307* via a water molecule. The ester oxygen on fructose C6 was hydrogen-bonded to Lys-422*. The ring oxygen of the fructose also appeared to form a hydrogen bond with Lys-422*. The glucose moiety of SOS made only two direct interactions with the protein (between the sulfate group on C2 and Arg-429* and between the sulfate on C6 and Ser-305*). All other interactions were mediated through water molecules. The non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry, which related the A and B sites, was not exact. In the apo-structure, it was already apparent that the A site was narrower than the B site as the result of a small “movement” of the αB helix. The binding of SOS to the A site caused αB to move further inwards (see below). Therefore, to accommodate SOS in a similar orientation at the wider B site would require a bigger movement in αB, which seemed to be restricted by crystal packing. On the other hand, the binding mode of SOS observed at the B site would cause steric clashes inside the narrower A site. Difference Fourier analysis suggested that there might be a third SOS molecule bound to the protein near the two-fold axis (Fig. 1B). Fig. 3A showed the features of the difference map in this region. Among the peaks shown, two (peaks 6 and 7) had intensities around 7 σ, and three (peaks 1, 4, and 5) had intensities around 5 σ. The intensities of the peaks and their proximity to each other were consistent with the possibility that they corresponded to sulfate groups on the same SOS molecule. The model shown in Fig. 3B represented the best fit that we could achieve in modeling SOS into the difference densities. The broken electron densities in the final 2Fo − Fc map suggested that the backbone of the sugar was probably flexible. As evident from the distribution of the peaks in the difference map, the binding of SOS to the interfacial C site was highly asymmetrical. The center of the mass of the ligand was shifted toward the A chain and away from the two-fold axis (between the two His-433 residues in Fig. 3A). In our model, only two residues from the B chain made contacts with the ligand (Fig. 3B); Lys-314* formed a hydrogen bond with the sulfate group on glucose C2, and His-433* was hydrogen-bonded to the sulfate groups on fructose C1 and C3. In contrast, five residues from the A chain interacted with the ligand. Lys-314 and Arg-369 were hydrogen-bonded to the sulfate groups on fructose C3 and C4. His-376 seemed to interact with the sulfate"
https://openalex.org/W2038339914,"The presence of uniformly small collagen fibrils in tendon repair is believed to play a major role in suboptimal tendon healing. Collagen V is significantly elevated in healing tendons and plays an important role in fibrillogenesis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a particular chain of collagen V on the fibrillogenesis of Sprague-Dawley rat tenocytes, as well as the efficacy of Col V siRNA engineered tenocytes for tendon tissue engineering. RNA interference gene therapy and a scaffold free tissue engineered tendon model were employed. The results showed that scaffold free tissue engineered tendon had tissue-specific tendon structure. Down regulation of collagen V α1 or α2 chains by siRNAs (Col5α1 siRNA, Col5α2 siRNA) had different effects on collagen I and decorin gene expressions. Col5α1 siRNA treated tenocytes had smaller collagen fibrils with abnormal morphology; while those Col5α2 siRNA treated tenocytes had the same morphology as normal tenocytes. Furthermore, it was found that tendons formed by coculture of Col5α1 siRNA treated tenocytes with normal tenocytes at a proper ratio had larger collagen fibrils and relative normal contour. Conclusively, it was demonstrated that Col V siRNA engineered tenocytes improved tendon tissue regeneration. And an optimal level of collagen V is vital in regulating collagen fibrillogenesis. This may provide a basis for future development of novel cellular- and molecular biology-based therapeutics for tendon diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1988533241,"Human observers explore scenes by shifting their gaze from object to object. Before each eye movement, a peripheral glimpse of the next object to be fixated has however already been caught. Here we investigate whether the perceptual organization extracted from such a preview could guide the perceptual analysis of the same object during the next fixation. We observed that participants were indeed significantly faster at grouping together spatially separate elements into an object contour, when the same contour elements had also been grouped together in the peripheral preview display. Importantly, this facilitation occurred despite a change in the grouping cue defining the object contour (similarity versus collinearity). We conclude that an intermediate-level description of object shape persists in the visual system across gaze shifts, providing it with a robust basis for balancing efficiency and continuity during scene exploration."
