https://openalex.org/W2095858175,"Both serotonin and the selective gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) agonist, baclofen, increase potassium (K+) conductance in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Although these agonists act on separate receptors, the potassium currents evoked by the agonists are not additive, indicating that the two receptors share the same potassium channels. Experiments with hydrolysis-resistant guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate analogs and pertussis toxin indicate that the opening of the potassium channels by serotonin and GABAB receptors involves a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding (G) protein, which may directly couple the two receptors to the potassium channel."

https://openalex.org/W2026358434,"Binding of tRNAPhe to ribosomes shields a set of highly conserved nucleotides in 16S rRNA from attack by a combination of structure-specific chemical probes. The bases can be classified according to whether or not their protection is strictly poly(U)-dependent (G529, G530, U531, A1408, A1492, and A1493) or poly(U)-independent (A532, G693, A794, C795, G926, 2mG966, G1338, A1339, U1381, C1399, C1400, and G1401). A third class (A790, G791, and A909) is shielded by both tRNA and 50S ribosomal subunits. Similar results are obtained when the protecting ligand is tRNAPheE. coli, tRNAPheyeast, tRNAPheE. coli lacking its 3′ terminal CA, or the 15 nucleotide anticodon stem-loop fragment of tRNAPheyeast. Implications for structural correlates of the classic ribosomal A- and P-sites and for the possible involvement of 16S rRNA in translational proofreading are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2039363610,"The CD4 (or T4) surface antigen of human T lymphocytes is an important part of the receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). After binding to the receptor, the HIV may enter the T cell and induce the formation of syncytia. In an attempt to identify the receptor site more closely, monoclonal antibodies (Mab's) to CD4 were tested for their ability to block HIV infection in a syncytium formation assay, and the CD4 epitopes so identified were mapped by antibody cross-blocking. The antibodies that showed strong inhibition of HIV fell into two main families while a third group of Mab's blocked syncytia formation weakly or not at all. Several different isolates of HIV as well as the laboratory strain CBL1 grown in CEM cells were used to induce the syncytia. The data indicate that only some epitopes of CD4 are important for virus binding and imply that the virus-binding site for CD4 is conserved in different isolates of HIV with substantially divergent env gene sequences. Preliminary studies of patients suggest that polymorphism of these epitopes does not play a role in determining susceptibility to infection."
https://openalex.org/W2073403442,"Stable myoblast cell lines were isolated after a brief exposure of mouse fibroblasts ( cells) to 5-azacytidine. We show that transfection of cells with DNA from these azacytidine-induced myoblasts (or from mouse C2C12 myoblasts) results in myogenic conversion of approximately 1 in 15,000 transfected colonies. In contrast, transfection of cells with DNA from nonmyogenic cells (parental cell DNA) does not give rise to myoblast colonies. These results indicate that an azacytidine-induced structural modification (presumably demethylation) in the DNA of a single locus is sufficient to convert cells into determined myoblasts."

https://openalex.org/W2060573304,"I-R hybrid dysgenesis in D. melanogaster is controlled by transposable elements known as I factors. We have determined the base sequences of one complete I factor and the ends of six others. The ends of these elements are highly conserved and are flanked by target site duplications varying in length from 10-14 bp. There are no terminal repeats, and the 3' end of one strand is A-rich, having 4-7 tandem repeats of the sequence TAA. This sequence organization is similar to that of mammalian LINEs, or L1 elements. The complete I factor sequence contains two long open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, of 1278 and 3258 bp. ORF1 encodes a possible nucleic acid-binding protein, and part of the amino acid sequence of ORF2 is similar to that of viral reverse transcriptases and polypeptides encoded by L1 elements. These results suggest that I factors transpose by reverse transcription of a full-length RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1488959538,"Recent evidence suggests the presence in resting platelets of centrally located compartments of glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa. We have employed an experimental procedure which dissociates and antigenically denatures the surface compartment of GP IIb-IIIa and allows internal compartments of GP IIb-IIIa to be studied immunochemically and functionally in intact platelets. When gel-filtered platelets are incubated with 0.25 mM EGTA at 37 degrees C for 30 min, and then supplemented for 30 min with 5 mM calcium, they lose their ability to bind GP IIb-IIIa complex-specific monoclonal antibody Fab fragments. However, when such platelets are subsequently stimulated with thrombin, GP IIb-IIIa-specific Fabs are again able to bind in large amounts to the platelet surface, in concert with the appearance of substantial amounts of receptors for fibrinogen and fibronectin. In immunoprecipitation experiments, we have found that this thrombin-displayed pool of GP IIb-IIIa originates from a pool that is not labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination of intact resting platelets. In immunofluorescence experiments, we have found that EGTA-incubated platelets contain a large sequestered internal pool of GP IIb-IIIa which upon thrombin stimulation is translocated to the platelet surface. Additional experiments suggest that this centrally located compartment may be surface connected in resting platelets and that it is accessible to some extracellular proteins, but not others."

https://openalex.org/W2120060779,"Exposed portions of the 32 kd chloroplast membrane quinone-binding and triazine herbicide-binding protein of photosystem II have been mapped to the lumenal or to the outer (stromal) surface of the thylakoid by following reactions of antibodies generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted hydrophilic amino acid sequences with normally oriented or everted membrane vesicles. These data have led to the construction of a model with five membrane-spanning domains. The model has been verified, in part, by immunoblots of fragments of the protein produced by trypsin treatment of thylakoids with peptide-specific antibodies. Some of the hydrophilic loops appear to be in close contact with proteins of the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II inasmuch as their removal increases the antibody reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1486952955,"Purified human plasma vitronectin was demonstrated to bind to type I collagen immobilized on plastic as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by binding of 125I-radiolabeled vitronectin to a collagen-coated plastic surface. Vitronectin did not bind to immobilized laminin, fibronectin, or albumin in these assays. Vitronectin showed similar interaction with all types of collagen (I, II, III, IV, V, and VI) tested. Collagen unfolded by heat treatment bound vitronectin less efficiently than native collagen. Vitronectin-coated colloidal gold particles bound to type I collagen fibrils as shown by electron microscopy. Salt concentrations higher than physiological interfered with the binding of vitronectin to collagen, suggesting an ionic interaction between the two proteins. Binding studies conducted in the presence of plasma showed that purified vitronectin added to plasma bound to immobilized collagen, whereas the endogenous plasma vitronectin bound to collagen less well. Although fibronectin did not interfere with the binding of vitronectin to native collagen, vitronectin inhibited the binding of fibronectin to collagen. These results show that vitronectin has a collagen-binding site(s) which, unlike that of fibronectin, preferentially recognizes triple-helical collagen and that the binding between vitronectin and collagen has characteristics compatible with the occurrence of such an interaction in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1533728933,"Subunits of RNA polymerase II that come into contact with nascent RNA transcripts have been determined by photoaffinity labeling. Transcription was carried out in a cell-free extract in the presence of 4-thio-UTP, and utilized the major late promoter of adenovirus-2 DNA. The transcript length was limited by inclusion of the chain terminator 3'-O-methyl-GTP. Transcription complexes were irradiated with near-UV light (lambda greater than 300 nm) to specifically photoactivate 4-thio-uridine. After photocross-linking, radiolabeled proteins were separated by electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and visualized by autoradiography. Specific photoaffinity labeling of enzyme subunits IIo and IIc was observed. In some experiments, radiolabeled IIa was also detected. Based on the level of photoaffinity labeling of subunits IIo and IIa, relative to their concentration in the transcription reaction, the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase IIO appears to be greater than 10 times that of IIA. RNA attached to subunits IIo and IIc was estimated to be 16-40 nucleotides in length, whereas RNA attached to subunit IIa was approximately 27-40 nucleotides long. Photoaffinity labeling was sensitive to alpha-amanitin, and required DNA containing an RNA polymerase II promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2161531330,"Charybdotoxin is a high-affinity specific inhibitor of the high-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel found in the plasma membranes of many vertebrate cell types. Using Ca2+-activated K+ channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayer membranes as an assay, we have purified the toxin from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus by a two-step procedure involving chromatofocusing on SP-Sephadex, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Charybdotoxin is shown to be a highly basic protein with a mass of 10 kDa. Under our standard assay conditions, the purified toxin inhibits the Ca2+-activated K+ channel with an apparent dissociation constant of 3.5 nM. The protein is unusually stable, with inhibitory potency being insensitive to boiling or exposure to organic solvents. The toxin's activity is sensitive to chymotrypsin treatment and to acylation of lysine groups. The protein may be radioiodinated without loss of activity."
https://openalex.org/W90170755,"Sea urchin sperm motility can be activated by alkalinization of the internal pH, and previous studies have shown that the internal pH can be regulated by a voltage-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger present in the flagellar plasma membrane. In this study, the effects of speract, a peptide purified from egg conditioned media, on the Na+/H+ exchange were investigated. Evidence presented indicates that speract activates K+ channels in the flagellar membrane and modulates the Na+/H+ exchange activity through resultant changes in membrane potential. In the presence of tetraphenylphosphonium, a lipophilic ion, or high external Na+, the isolated flagella were depolarized, and Na+/H+ exchanger was inhibited. Speract and valinomycin, a K+ ionophore, were able to reactivate 22Na+ uptake, H+ efflux, and alkalinization of intraflagellar pH under either of the depolarizing conditions. Membrane potential measurements using 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanide iodide indicated repolarization by either speract or valinomycin. The speract-induced voltage changes did not require Na+ but were sensitive to [K+]. Thus, speract induced a slight depolarization in Na+-free seawater with 10 mM K+ but a hyperpolarization with 2 mM K+. Further support for the activation of K+ channels in the flagella was the 2-5-fold stimulation of K+ efflux induced by speract as measured with a K+ electrode. The ionic selectivity of the speract-activated channel assessed by voltage measurements was K+ greater than Rb+ greater than Cs+. The half-maximally effective concentration of speract was about 0.2 nM. That the H+ and K+ efflux in response to peptide was receptor-mediated was confirmed by the use of speract or resact on intact sea urchin spermatozoa, where the peptides were found to stimulate K+ efflux and to reverse the tetraphenylphosphonium inhibition on H+ efflux only in the homologous spermatozoa. Modulation of the voltage-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange by egg peptides, therefore, appears to be indirect and is coupled through its action on membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W1576256885,"Prothrombin is a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein that binds to phospholipid vesicles in the presence of calcium ions after undergoing a metal ion-induced conformational transition. To integrate recent data into a scheme that is compatible with our knowledge of prothrombin-metal interaction, we have proposed a new model of prothrombin structure. In this model prothrombin undergoes two metal-dependent conformational transitions: PT----PT'----PT*. The first transition is not cation-specific, but the second transition is metal-selective for Ca(II), Sr(II), or Ba(II). Only the PT* conformer binds to phospholipid surfaces. To test this model, anti-prothrombin antibodies that only bind to prothrombin in the presence of Ca(II) but not Mg(II) (PT*-specific) were isolated, and termed anti-prothrombin X Ca(II)-specific. Half-maximal binding of antibody to prothrombin was observed at 0.1 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM SrCl2, but no binding was observed with Mg(II), Mn(II), or Ba(II). However, prothrombin in the presence of both Mg(II)/Ba(II) or Mn(II)/Ba(II) demonstrated significant interaction with the antibody. Prothrombin binding to phospholipid vesicles was inhibited by the anti-prothrombin X Ca(II)-specific antibody or its Fab fragment, but was not inhibited by anti-prothrombin X Mg(II) antibody or its Fab fragment directed at the PT' conformer. These results support this three-state model for prothrombin. The metal specificity characteristic of prothrombin-phospholipid interaction is a property required for the expression of the phospholipid-binding site in the binary prothrombin-metal complex."

https://openalex.org/W1564917523,"Sodium-dependent calcium efflux from rat liver mitochondria has been studied as a function of mitochondrial calcium loads (2 to 40 nmol/mg) and extramitochondrial sodium concentrations (5 to 40 mM). The resulting data can be fit to a terreactant model which exhibits simultaneous kinetics (i.e. both sodium and calcium must be bound simultaneously for transport to occur). The Hill coefficients for the calcium and sodium dependences were 1.0 +/- 0.1 and 2.0 +/- 0.2, respectively. The cooperativity of the sodium dependence allows the terreactant model to be reduced to a bireactant model in which the sodium concentration only appears mathematically as the square of the sodium concentration. The data then fit the relationship (Formula: see text) The experimentally determined value of Vmax is found to be 2.6 +/- 0.5 nmol/mg/min, and the load of calcium (KCa) and concentration of sodium (KNa) necessary to stimulate the efflux to half its maximal calcium-dependent activity and sodium-dependent activity, respectively, were 8.1 +/- 1.4 nmol of Ca2+/mg and 9.4 +/- 0.6 mM Na+. This sodium-dependent calcium efflux from liver mitochondria was inhibited by magnesium, by ruthenium red, and by tetraphenylphosphonium. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at 1.0-1.5 mM magnesium, at 12 nmol of ruthenium red/mg of protein, and at 0.2 microM tetraphenylphosphonium."
https://openalex.org/W1545663909,"The neuropeptide substance P (SP) stimulates human T-lymphocyte function in vitro. Human blood T-lymphocytes and cultured human IM-9 B-lymphoblasts express 7,000-10,000 and 25,000-30,000 substance P receptors per cell, respectively. The specific binding of 125I-SP is retained in IM-9 lymphoblast membranes solubilized in 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS) at a detergent-to-protein ratio of 1.0. In addition, specific and reversible SP binding to soluble IM-9 cell membrane proteins is demonstrated by gel filtration. The saturation of binding of 125I-SP to both intact and solubilized IM-9 cell membranes attained a steady state after 40-50 min at 4 degrees C. Scatchard analysis of the concentration dependence of 125I-SP binding to IM-9 cell membranes revealed a KD of 0.87 +/- 0.8 nM (mean +/- S.D., n = 4), which is similar to that observed in intact cells, and a density of receptors of 21 +/- 3 fmol/mg of membrane protein (mean +/- S.D.). Binding of 125I-SP to solubilized membranes demonstrated a KD of 0.75 +/- 0.33 nM (mean +/- S.D., n = 3) and a density of receptors of 3.7 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg of membrane protein (mean +/- S.D., n = 3). Affinity cross-linking of 125I-SP by disuccinimidyl suberate to intact IM-9 cells and membranes revealed specifically labeled proteins of Mr 58,000 and 33,000 in cells, and 58,000, 33,000, and 16,000 in membranes by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Competitive effects of substituent peptides of SP on cross-linking and 125I-SP binding to membranes demonstrated that the SP receptor recognized the carboxyl-terminal domain of the peptide. Membranes from cells preincubated in vitro for 12 h at 37 degrees C with 10(-8) M SP demonstrated a decrease in SP receptor density to 13 +/- 2 fmol/mg (mean +/- S.D., n = 2), and a parallel diminution in the specific labeling of membrane proteins of Mr 58,000 and 33,000. These observations suggest that solubilization in CHAPS preserves the binding characteristics of the IM-9 lymphoblast receptor for SP, and that affinity cross-linking techniques identify by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis membrane proteins that are specifically labeled by SP."
https://openalex.org/W1603545969,"The disulfide bridge pattern of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) given earlier (Sottrup-Jensen, L., Stepanik, T. M., Kristensen, T., Wierzbicki, D. M., Jones, C. M., Lonblad, P. B., Magnusson, S., and Petersen, T. E. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 8318-8327) has been revised by showing that Cys255 and Cys408 in one subunit are bridged to Cys408 and Cys255, respectively, in the adjacent subunit of the proteinase binding dimer. Thus, the alpha 2M-dimer contains two interchain disulfide bridges, and the individual subunits are arranged in an antiparallel fashion. These results are the outcome of partial reduction experiments, where reduction of methylamine-treated alpha 2M with 1-8 mM mercaptoethanesulfonate at pH 8.0 resulted in the appearance of 2.6 mol of SH-groups per mol of free subunit. Apart from reduction of the two interchain bridges, the intrachain bridges Cys228-Cys276, Cys572-Cys748, Cys798-Cys826, and Cys824-Cys860 are reduced to a minor extent under these conditions. The disulfide bridge pattern of alpha 2M has been completed by showing that the alpha 2M subunit contains 11 intrachain bridges, including a bridge connecting Cys447 with Cys540."
https://openalex.org/W1561943091,"A cDNA clone, pUDPGTr-4, encoding a form of rat UDP-glucuronosyltransferase has been isolated from a SV40 expression library. Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA is 1970 base pairs in length and encodes a protein of 530 amino acids, which has amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences characteristic of signal peptide and transmembrane segments, respectively. There is one potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site. Transfection of UDPGTr-4 cDNA into COS cells resulted in the glucuronidation of etiocholanolone, androsterone, and lithocholic acid in a transient expression assay. Several other common substrates of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were not conjugated by the UDPGTr-4 enzyme. UDPGTr-4 cDNA is identical in sequence over a common 1.7 kilobase-region of overlap to UDPGTr-1, a cDNA previously isolated in this laboratory (Mackenzie, P. I., Gonzalez, F. J., and Owens, I. S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12153-12160). UDPGTr-4 cDNA, however, contains a shorter 3'-untranslated region. Northern analysis showed that the poly(A) RNA counterparts of UDPGTr-4 and UDPGTr-1 cDNAs are approximately 2.3 and 3.0 kilobases in length, respectively. The steady-state level of UDPGTr-4 poly(A) RNA in the liver is 20-fold higher than that of UDPGTr-1 poly(A) RNA. These data indicate that the UDPGTr-4 enzyme is a 3-hydroxyandrogen UDP-glucuronosyltransferase which is encoded by two distinct species of mRNA transcribed from the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1584737584,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been shown to bind to specific receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and to cause an increase in intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) content. We have recently demonstrated that a prominent Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport system is present in VSMC and that a permeable cGMP analog (8-bromo-cGMP) stimulates activity of the cotransporter. We have also shown that the ANF peptide, rat atriopeptin III, stimulates Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport and elevates intracellular cGMP levels in VSMC. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ANF stimulation of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport occurs via an increase in cGMP levels. When the quinolinedione, 6-anilo-5,8-quinolinedione (LY83583) (10 microM), was used to block formation of cGMP in VSMC from primary cultures of rat thoracic aorta, it was found that both basal and rat atriopeptin III (100 nM)-stimulated Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport were significantly inhibited. The effect of LY83583 was dose-dependent and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration was 0.5 microM. LY83583 also inhibited cotransport in the presence of a maximal concentration of 8-bromo-cGMP. However, this inhibition was not seen in cells also treated with 2-O-propoxyphenyl-8-azapurin-6-one (M&B 22,948), an inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase. M&B 22,948 alone also increased levels of cotransport. Since inhibition of cGMP formation blocks ANF-stimulated Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport and inhibition of cGMP breakdown enhances Na+, K+, Cl- cotransport, we conclude that ANF stimulation of Na+,K+,Cl- cotransport in VSMC is mediated via increase in intracellular cGMP levels."

https://openalex.org/W2082700869,"Mutations in Drosophila homeotic genes lead to the developmental replacement of one normal body part by another. We have examined the mechanism by which a dominant allele of the Antennapedia (Antp) gene causes the antennae to be replaced by legs. Normal Antp gene activity is required for thoracic but not for head development. We demonstrate that the Antp73b inversion mutation results in Antp transcription in the head. Antp transcripts found in this abnormal location are of two types: normal-sized Antp RNAs and fusion RNAs joining Antp exons (including the protein-coding region) to 5′ exons from another gene. This foreign gene is normally expressed in the head, suggesting the cause for abnormal activation of Antp. The result is a change of cell identity from head to thorax."
https://openalex.org/W1568569936,"Cholecystokinin previously has been characterized by chromatographic and immunological techniques. Analysis of cDNA has revealed the structure of preprocholecystokinin. The predicted processing sites of preprocholecystokinin cannot account for the multiple forms of cholecystokinin detected. This report details the isolation and characterization of cholecystokinin peptides containing 58, 39, 33, 25, 18, 8, 7, and 5 amino acids. None of the cleavages that occurred to form these peptides was at the carboxyl side of double basic residues. Cholecystokinin 25, 18, and 7 have not previously been isolated and identified by sequence analysis. The processing that forms these peptides includes cleavage after single basic residues for the 58, 39, 33, and 8 amino acid peptides. The 25, 18, 7, and 5 amino acid peptides must be formed by other endopeptidases or combinations of endo- and exopeptidases. The analysis of this series of peptides provides the chemical basis for structural differences in cholecystokinin molecules previously demonstrated by chromatographic and immunological methods. These structures provide insight into tissue-specific processing that occurs for this important regulatory peptide in intestine and brain."
https://openalex.org/W1647778478,The protein(s) that constitute(s) the cGMP-regulated channel in vertebrate photoreceptors has been solubilized from rod outer segment membranes and reincorporated into the membrane of calcium-containing liposomes. The properties of the reconstituted channel protein were determined by studying the cGMP-stimulated efflux of Ca2+ from these liposomes. Among several detergents tested the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) proved to be the most suitable. Solubilization of channel activity was found to be optimal at a detergent concentration of about 18 mM. The presence of Ca2+ ions and phospholipids during solubilization greatly increased the channel stability. The reconstituted channel shared most but not all properties with the channel in situ. It is cooperatively activated by cGMP with an EC50 of 19 microM. The cooperativity as determined from Hill plots was n = 2.7. Unlike the cGMP-sensitive channel in the native membrane of isolated discs and excised patches of plasma membrane it is not blocked by l-cis-diltiazem. Reconstitution of this channel protein(s) may serve as a valuable tool for identifying the polypeptide composition and to study structural and functional aspects of the purified protein(s).
https://openalex.org/W1583381215,"Employing a monoclonal antibody raised against the receptor protein, we have probed the mechanism of ligand interaction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata. Antibody WF6 specifically binds to alpha-subunits of the receptor with a stoichiometry of one molecule per receptor monomer. At saturating concentrations, WF6 blocks half of the binding sites for acetylcholine, all of the binding sites for alpha-neurotoxins, and none of the binding sites for representative cholinergic antagonists (with the exception of alpha-toxins) at the receptor. In the presence of saturating concentrations of antibody WF6, acetylcholine (or its agonists) cannot induce T1+ influx into Torpedo membrane vesicles. Rapid oversaturation of the receptor by agonist also cannot overcome this blockade of channel gating. The observed competition patterns of WF6 and representative cholinergic ligands with the receptor are evidence for separate binding sites for groups of ligands and for a network of allosterically linked effector regions at the receptor. The blockade by saturating concentrations of WF6 of the agonist-induced channel gating supports the conclusion that two molecules of agonist are required to activate the receptor-integral ion channel."

Experimental evidence is now presented consistent with the existence of such a binding site by demonstrating efficient and accurate trans-self-splicing of a yeast mitochondrial group II intron. Partial and complete trans-splicing reactions take place in the absence of branch formation, part of the usual pathway of nuclear splicing and group II self-splicing. In addition to indicating the existence of a 5' exon binding site on the intron, the results have mechanistic implications for group II self-splicing and perhaps for nuclear splicing as well."
https://openalex.org/W1592842418,"The action of iron-bleomycin and O2 in cleaving DNA has been resolved into two kinetic events following the initial attack on DNA by the kinetically competent drug species, activated bleomycin. At 4 degrees C, DNA strand scission, monitored both viscometrically and fluorimetrically (t1/2 = 2.5-5 min), precedes the release from DNA of nucleic base propenals, which is half complete in about 40 min. Therefore, a moderately stable intermediate consisting of cleaved DNA bearing a base propenal precursor is formed. The release of tritium from deoxyribose carbon-2 occurs at the time of DNA scission, which is consistent with the base propenal precursor retaining the deoxyribose-3'-phosphate bond. Specific mechanistic proposals are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1519934232,"Bacteriophage T4 late promoters display a conserved sequence that extends over about 18 base pairs, in which the central 8-base pair sequence (TATAAATA in the nontranscribed strand) is absolutely conserved. Transcription by T4-modified RNA polymerase in vitro nevertheless initiates within a cluster of 6 overlapping variant T4 late promoters that deviate from the absolutely conserved sequence at one or two positions. One of these variant promoters is dominant, and its sequence implies that two of the absolutely conserved nucleotides (underlined above) are not essential. Three other variant promoters that contain only one of the deviations found in the dominant variant promoter are, at best, utilized weakly, suggesting that sequences outside the absolutely conserved segment are important for promoter function. A newly devised method, based on arrest of RNA chain elongation with ribonucleotide analogs and its reversal, has been used to precisely map initiation within the overlapping promoter cluster. Multiple cycles of RNA chain arrest, pyrophosphorolysis, and resynthesis can be executed. This process permits a precise stepwise control of the advance of a transcription complex through a gene."
https://openalex.org/W1719820092,"Complexes of protein HC and monoclonal IgA1 or IgA2 or polyclonal IgA were isolated from human blood plasma. Dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting showed that all complexes contain three types of chains: two light immunoglobulin chains, one regular IgA alpha-chain, and one chain with Mr = 90,000 carrying both alpha-chain and protein HC epitopes. The complexes were split into Fab alpha and Fc alpha fragments by bacterial IgA proteases. The protein HC epitopes were linked to the Fc fragments. Complexes of protein HC and an alpha-chain devoid of the variable region and the first heavy chain constant domain could also be demonstrated to be present in the blood plasma of a patient with alpha-heavy chain disease. Pepsin digestion of HC-IgA released a fragment containing all the protein HC epitopes and the C-terminal nonapeptide of the IgA alpha-chain. The light immunoglobulin chains, the regular alpha-chain, and the 90,000-Da chain from monoclonal HC-IgA1 were isolated by preparative dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by repeated gel filtration in dodecyl sulfate-containing buffer. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the alpha-chain was identical with that of a regular human heavy immunoglobulin chain of subgroup III. Subtractive degradations of the 90,000-Da chain displayed 2 amino acid residues in each position in a pattern suggesting simultaneous degradations of a chain identical with the regular alpha-chain of HC-IgA and of uncomplexed, low molecular weight, protein HC. All the results are compatible with a model for HC-IgA in which a single low molecular weight protein HC polypeptide chain is covalently linked, side by side, to the C-terminal nonapeptide of one of the two alpha-chains of a regular monomeric IgA unit."

Although in intact vesicles UDP-Glc was utilized in an efficient manner to form Dol-P-Glc and glucosylated oligosaccharide-lipid, after disruption of vesicle integrity, even with low concentrations of Triton X-100, the coupling of Dol-P-Glc formation to lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly and subsequent N-glycosylation was substantially impaired. Increased incubation temperatures also resulted in a decreased effectiveness of glucose transfer from Dol-P-Glc to lipid-oligosaccharide, presumably because of a decline in the extent of structural organization of the ER membranes. The limited availability of endogenous Dol-P was demonstrated by the pronounced stimulation in Dol-P-Glc formation resulting from the addition of this lipid acceptor to Triton-disrupted ER membranes as well as by its generation in intact vesicles. The latter was accomplished by stimulating recycling of endogenous Dol-P through the addition of a peptide (Tyr-Asn-Leu-Thr-Ser-Val) which is an N-glycosylation substrate. The inhibition of Dol-P-Glc synthesis from UDP-Glc observed in the presence of elevated levels of GDP-Man which could be relieved in Triton-disrupted or intact ER vesicles by the addition or generation, respectively, of Dol-P, is considered to be the result of a competing requirement for Dol-P by the mannosyltransferase. Moreover GTP, by selectively inhibiting the mannosyltransferase, prevented the decrease of Dol-P-Glc formation caused by GDP-Man. Since addition of the acceptor peptide to intact vesicles stimulated Dol-P-P-GlcNAc as well as Dol-P-Glc and Dol-P-Man synthesis it would appear that a pool of Dol-P available in common to all three enzymes responsible for dolichol-linked monosaccharide synthesis exists in the ER membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1558656596,"A specific antigenic peptide was obtained from protein B23 (Mr/pI = 37,000/5.1) after 30 min of digestion with staphylococcal V8 protease (10 micrograms/ml/mg protein B23). The antigenic peptide was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase C18 column. The antigenic peptide contains 14.7 and 18.7 mol% of glutamic acid and lysine, respectively. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that the peptide has 68 amino acids and is located on the carboxyl-terminal sequence of protein B23. The sequence is Ser-Phe-Lys-Lys-Gln-Glu-Lys-Thr-Pro-Lys-Thr-Pro- Lys-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Val-Glu-Asp-Ile-Lys-Ala-Lys-Met-Gln-Ala-Ser-Ile-Glu- Lys-Gly- Gly-Ser-Leu-Pro-Lys-Val-Glu-Ala-Lys-Phe-Ile-Asn-Tyr-Val-Lys-Asn-Cys-Phe- Arg-Met- Thr-Asp-Gln-Glu-Ala-Ile-Gln-Asp-Leu-Trp-Gln-Trp-Arg-Lys-Ser-Leu-Cooh. Extensive digestion of the antigenic peptide with V8 protease, trypsin, or chymotrypsin results in loss of the antigenic activity. Three cloned cDNAs (hpB1, hpB2, and hpB7) which code for the 82 amino acids at the COOH terminus of protein B23 and the 3' non-translating sequence were identified and characterized. All three clones have identical nucleotide sequences coding for the antigenic portion of the protein (68 amino acids at the COOH terminus), the stop codon, and the 3' non-translated region. However, mutation of 6 nucleotide bases of one clone (hpB2) caused changes in 4 amino acids in the sequence just preceding the immunoreactive region. The result suggests the presence of at least 2 immunologically similar but distinct proteins which are both recognized by the anti-B23 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1605614580,"The sodium channel purified from rat brain is a heterotrimeric complex of alpha (Mr 260,000), beta 1 (Mr 36,000), and beta 2 (Mr 33,000) subunits. alpha and beta 2 are attached by disulfide bonds. Removal of beta 1 subunits by incubation in 1.0 M MgCl2 followed by reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles yielded a preparation of alpha beta 2 which did not bind [3H]saxitoxin, mediate veratridine-activated 22Na+ influx, or bind the 125I-labeled alpha-scorpion toxin from Leiurus quinquestriatus (LqTx). In contrast, removal of beta 2 subunits by reduction of disulfide bonds with 1.5 mM dithiothreitol followed by reconstitution into phospholipid vesicles yielded a preparation of alpha beta 1 that retained full sodium channel function. Alpha beta 1 bound [3H]saxitoxin with a KD of 4.1 nM at 36 degrees C. It mediated veratridine-activated 22Na+ influx at a comparable initial rate as intact sodium channels with a K0.5 for veratridine of 46 microM. Tetracaine and tetrodotoxin blocked 22Na+ influx. Like intact sodium channels, alpha beta 1 bound 125I-LqTx in a voltage-dependent manner with a KD of approximately 6 nM at a membrane potential of -60 mV and was specifically covalently labeled by azidonitrobenzoyl 125I-LqTx. When incorporated into planar phospholipid bilayers, alpha beta 1 formed batrachotoxin-activated sodium channels of 24 pS whose voltage-dependent activation was characterized by V50 = -110 mV and an apparent gating charge of 3.3 +/- 0.3. These results indicate that beta 2 subunits are not required for the function of purified and reconstituted sodium channels while a complex of alpha and beta 1 subunits is both necessary and sufficient for channel function in the purified state."
https://openalex.org/W1546567268,"Pregnancy zone protein (PZP) was isolated from late pregnancy serum and examined for binding to normal skin fibroblasts in culture. A high-affinity binding site on these cells is demonstrated for PZP reacted with methylamine. Experiments with alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) and PZP, both modified by methylamine, showed this receptor to be identical to the previously characterized receptor for alpha 2M-proteinase complexes (Van Leuven, F., Cassiman, J.J., and Van den Berghe, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5155-5160). With available monoclonal antibodies directed toward alpha 2M and prepared toward PZP, only a limited cross-reaction was observed. We obtained a monoclonal antibody which defines a neo-antigenic site on PZP-methylamine, completely analogous to the monoclonal antibody F2B2, which was previously shown to define a neo-antigenic site on alpha 2M complexes (Marynen, P., Van Leuven, F., Cassiman, J.J., and Van den Berghe, H. (1981) J. Immunol. 127, 1782-1786). These results provide evidence for the homologous function of alpha 2M and PZP as proteinase scavengers. The need for an extra proteinase inhibitor of the alpha 2M-type in pregnancy is discussed. The monoclonal antibodies now available will prove helpful in quantitation and eventually isolation of proteinase complexes of alpha 2M and PZP."
https://openalex.org/W1491082896,"Thyroglobulin secreted by porcine thyroid cells in serum-free culture was previously found (Ronin, C., Fenouillet, E., Hovsepian, S., Fayet, G., and Fournet, B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7287-7293) to contain more highly branched complex carbohydrate chains than the thyroid-derived molecules. When assayed for their ability to react with polyclonal antibodies directed against the natural prohormone in competitive radioimmunoassays, using the porcine antigen as iodinated tracer and standard competitor, in vitro thyroglobulin appeared to be 4-fold less immunoreactive than the in vivo molecule. However, both types of thyroglobulin exhibited superimposable incomplete displacement curves after peripheral deglycosylation using a mixture of neuraminidase, alpha-, and beta-galactosidases while they behave as good competitors as the native antigen after removal of the majority of the carbohydrate chains by Endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F. Solid-phase binding assays revealed that in vitro thyroglobulin was able to bind less antibodies than its thyroid-derived counterpart before as well as after treatment with exo- or endoglycosidases. Furthermore, only 20% of thyroglobulin biosynthetically labeled with glucosamine could be precipitated with specific antibodies followed by addition of staphylococcal-protein A, whereas up to 61% of the labeling was specifically bound when the antibodies were preincubated with protein A. After pronase digestion, both thyroglobulin-like material displayed different carbohydrate structures as judged by concanavalin A-Sepharose analysis. Thus, substituting multiantennary complex carbohydrate chains to the usual biantennary and high mannose structures present on thyroid-derived thyroglobulin had a profound effect on the prohormone immunoreactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2062178189,"The chromosome of R6K contains multiple origins of replication. The origin γ is infrequently used in the original plasmid and remains “silent” in certain miniplasmid derivatives. The inactivation of the origin is caused by a natural origin silencer located adjacent to the minimal ori γ sequence. The silencer functions in cis and has no trans activity. It has functional polarity and works only in one orientation when present immediately downstream from ori γ. The silencer apparently initiates an RNA that invades ori γ and turns it off either by competing with a primer RNA or by disrupting ori γ structure. As predicted, removal of the silencer blocks the synthesis of silencer RNA and derepresses the origin."
https://openalex.org/W1556672619,"The effects of the condensation product of N-methyl-p-methoxyphenethylamine with formaldehyde (compound 48/80) and ruthenium red on the partial reactions of the catalytic cycle of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase of skeletal muscle were studied. The ATPase activity and both Ca2+ and Sr2+ uptake were inhibited by compound 48/80 when oxalate was used as a precipitating agent. The degree of inhibition decreased when oxalate was replaced by orthophosphate as the precipitating anion. Both the fast Ca2+ efflux and the synthesis of ATP observed during reversal of the Ca2+ pump were inhibited by compound 48/80. Inhibition of the reversal of the Ca2+ pump was caused by a competition between compound 48/80 and orthophosphate for the phosphorylation site of the enzyme. The fast Ca2+ release promoted by arsenate was impaired by compound 48/80. Ruthenium red competes with Ca2+ for the high affinity binding site of the Ca2+-ATPase, but did not interfere with the binding of Ca2+ to the low affinity binding site of the enzyme. In presence of Ca2+ concentrations higher than 5 microM, ruthenium red in concentrations up to 200 microM had no effect on both ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake. However, the fast Ca2+ efflux promoted by arsenate and the fast Ca2+ efflux coupled with the synthesis of ATP observed during the reversal of the Ca2+ pump were inhibited by ruthenium red, half-maximal inhibition being attained in presence of 10-20 microM ruthenium red. In contrast to the effect of compound 48/80, ruthenium red did not inhibit the phosphorylation of the enzyme by orthophosphate. The ATP in equilibrium with Pi exchange catalyzed by the Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of transmembrane Ca2+ gradient was also inhibited by ruthenium red."
https://openalex.org/W1491993225,"We previously described the isolation and preliminary characterization of a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, termed G.7.1, that carried a temperature-sensitive, conditional-lethal lesion affecting the acidification of vesicles in crude cellular extracts (Marnell, M. H., Mathis, L. S., Stookey, M., Shia, S.-P., Stone, D. K., and Draper, R. K. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 1907-1916). In the present report, we have separated lysosomal vesicles from more buoyant nonlysosomal vesicles by centrifuging cell extracts with Percoll and correlated the acidification defect with nonlysosomal vesicles, including endosomes, but not with secondary lysosomes. Moreover, the acidification of nonlysosomal vesicles prepared from mutant cells grown at the permissive temperature was more sensitive to thermal inactivation than similar vesicles from parental cells, implying that a heat-sensitive component is a normal resident of nonlysosomal vesicles in the mutant. This heat-sensitive component is apparently not associated with lysosomes, or if it is, it does not inhibit lysosomal acidification at the nonpermissive temperature. We also found that the transferrin-mediated uptake of iron is inhibited by 50% in the mutant cells at the nonpermissive temperature and that the inhibition cannot be accounted for by reduced binding or internalization of transferrin."
https://openalex.org/W1569332884,"Activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase II by static and dynamic steady-state cAMP levels was studied by reconstituting an in vitro model system composed of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase II. The rates of cAMP synthesis were regulated by incubating isolated membranes from AtT20 cells with various concentrations of forskolin. In the presence of 3-methylisobutylxanthine, the rate of protein kinase activation was proportional to the rate at which cAMP was synthesized, and there was a direct relationship between the degree of activation and the level of cAMP produced. The activation profiles of protein kinase generated in the presence of exogenous cAMP or cAMP produced by activation of adenylate cyclase in the absence of cAMP degradation were indistinguishable. Dynamic steady-state levels of cAMP were achieved by incubating the membranes with forskolin in the presence of purified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Under these conditions, the apparent activation constant of protein kinase II for cAMP was reduced by 65-75%. This increased sensitivity to activation by cAMP was seen when phosphotransferase activity was measured directly in reaction mixtures containing membranes, protein kinase, and histone H2B or when regulatory and catalytic subunits were first separated by immunoprecipitation of holoenzyme and regulatory subunits with specific anti-serum. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that rapid cAMP turnover may function as a mechanism for amplifying hormonal signals which use the cAMP-dependent protein kinase system."
https://openalex.org/W1508953855,"Two monoclonal antibodies raised against intact Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L2 were isolated, affinity-purified, and characterized. One of the antibodies (Ab 5-186) recognizes an epitope within residues 5-186, and the other (Ab 187-272) recognizes an epitope within residues 182-272. Both antibodies strongly inhibit in vitro polyphenylalanine synthesis when they are first allowed to bind to 50 S subunits prior addition of 30 S subunits. However, only Ab 187-272 is inhibitory when added to preformed 70 S ribosomes. Ab 5-186 binds to 50 S subunits but not to 70 S ribosomes. Ab 187-272 does not cause dissociation of 70 S ribosomes under the ionic conditions of the assay for polyphenylalanine synthesis (15 mM magnesium), although at 10 mM magnesium it does cause dissociation. Both antibodies inhibit the reassociation of 50 S with 30 S subunits. Both antibodies strongly inhibit peptidyltransferase activity. The two antibodies differ in their effects on interactions with elongation factors Tu (EF-Tu) and G (EF-G). Neither antibody significantly inhibits EF-G-dependent GTPase activity, nor the binding of EF-G when the antibodies are incubated with 50 S subunits; however, Ab 187-272 causes a decrease in the binding of EF-Tu X aminoacyl-tRNA X GTP ternary complex and of EF-Tu-dependent GTPase when it is incubated with 70 S ribosomes. The Fab fragments of both antibodies had effects similar to the intact antibodies. The results show that monoclonal antibodies can be used to discriminate different regions of L2 and that EF-Tu and EF-G do not have identical ribosomal binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1536023340,"We examined the response in the free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) of Daudi (human lymphoblastoid) cells to antibodies against human immunoglobulins (anti-Ig), and the relationship of [Ca2+]i to anti-Ig-induced capping. At 80 microM intracellular quin-2 (a fluorescent probe for [Ca2+]i), anti-Ig (10 micrograms/ml) caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i from 100 to 600 nM; the signal returned to baseline with approximately 1 min. At 450 microM intracellular quin-2, [Ca2+]i rose to only approximately 250 microM, and the signal declined gradually, returning to base line after greater than 7 min. In subsequent experiments, the lower concentrations of quin-2 were employed. Plots of the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients and of the binding of 125I-anti-Ig to Daudi cells versus the concentrations of anti-Ig showed similar saturation kinetics, with half-saturation occurring at 2-3 micrograms/ml. Part of the calcium in the transient is derived from the extracellular medium, and part from the nonmitochondrial intracellular stores. Caffeine (4 mM) and 8-(diethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate HCl (0.5 mM) suppressed the release of calcium from internal stores and the entry of calcium from outside the cells, but permitted capping in more than half of the cells. Phorbol esters (1-2 nM) inhibited both capping and the anti-Ig-induced decrease in [Ca2+]i. None of these agents blocked the binding of anti-Ig to the cells. It appears that receptor capping is not dependent on the anti-Ig-induced transient increase in calcium concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1583977031,"The in vitro translation products of mRNA pretreated with methylmercuric hydroxide were examined by giant two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In addition to increasing overall translational efficiency approximately 2.5-fold, methylmercuric hydroxide selectively increases the translation of mRNAs coding for higher molecular mass (greater than 45 kDa) proteins, allowing the routine resolution of 1500 [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. This yields 3 to 4-fold the number of translation products seen with smaller size two-dimensional gels. With this method we compare thymus cell proteins synthesized in vivo with the products of in vitro translation of mRNA recovered from thymus cells. Fifty-eight percent of the translation products are qualitatively the same as proteins synthesized in vivo (similar Mr, pI, and neighboring proteins), with 64% of these also being quantitatively similar (less than 5-fold difference). A comparison of thymus mRNA in vitro translation products with those coded for by mRNA from liver reveals only 32% qualitative similarity, with 63% of these also being quantitatively similar. These results are discussed in relation to predictions of mRNA abundance and complexity based on DNA:RNA hybridization data. Giant two-dimensional gel separations of in vitro translation products appear to be useful for detecting less abundant cellular mRNAs, including those that may be regulated by hormones or other physiological mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1596263424,"Eight monoclonal antibodies, all IgG2a, which recognize a 180/90-kDa glycoprotein similar in properties to the receptor for alpha 2-macroglobulin of mouse embryo 3T3 cell plasma membranes, have been tested for their effect on the binding and uptake of alpha 2-macroglobulin by live cells. One antibody directly inhibited binding of 125I-alpha 2-macroglobulin under conditions in which 125I-transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor was unaffected. Another monoclonal antibody decreased alpha 2-macroglobulin binding when preincubated with cells at 37 degrees C. This antibody was also capable of specifically binding to ligand-receptor complexes formed by preincubating 125I-alpha 2-macroglobulin with detergent extracts of Swiss 3T3 cells. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that the 180/90-kDa glycoprotein was localized in coated pits of the cell surface and in intracellular endocytic vesicles (receptosomes/endosomes). The data suggest that the 180/90-kDa glycoprotein is a component of the receptor for alpha 2-macroglobulin."
https://openalex.org/W37218100,"Myelin vesicles have been obtained from isolated rat brain myelin and shown by electron microscopy to consist of single bilayer membranes. The yield of the preparation is approximately 25% of the myelin proteins. The vesicles show a typical myelin protein pattern on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contain activity for the myelin marker enzyme, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphohydrolase (CNPase). The preparation consists of both inside-out and right-side-out vesicles, and the proportion in each orientation varies from one preparation to another. The occurrence of two populations is demonstrated by the observation that hypotonically lysed vesicles compete to a greater extent than intact vesicles in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with myelin basic protein antiserum. In addition, only a portion of the CNPase activity of the vesicles is trypsin-sensitive and detectable in the absence of detergent; the remaining, trypsin-insensitive activity is present in detergent-disrupted membranes. Thus, there are vesicle populations in which myelin basic protein and CNPase are accessible and others in which they are inaccessible. A population of uniformly oriented right-side-out vesicles has been obtained by ConA-Agarose affinity column chromatography and elution of the bound fraction with methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside. In the absence of detergent, less than 10% of the total CNPase activity of these vesicles can be demonstrated, suggesting that the active site of CNPase is opposite to that of the ConA binding site and, therefore, appears to be on the cytoplasmic face of the myelin membrane."
