https://openalex.org/W2111047819,"Cyanobacteria of the genus Oscillatoria (Trichodesmium) account for annual inputs of nitrogen to the world's oceans of about 4.8 x 10(12) grams while benthic environments contribute 15 x 10(12) grams. The sum of these inputs is one-fifth of current estimates of nitrogen fixation in terrestrial environments and one-half of the present rate of industrial synthesis of ammonia. When the total of all nitrogen inputs to the sea is compared with estimated losses through denitrification, the marine nitrogen cycle approximates a steady state. Oceanic nitrogen fixation can supply less than 0.3 percent of the calculated demand of marine phytoplankton. The minor contribution by nitrogen fixation to the overall nitrogen economy of the sea is not consistent with the supposition that nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient and suggests that factors other than nitrogen availability limit phytoplankton growth rates."

Linear viroid molecules are efficiently converted to circular molecules (circles) which are indistinguishable by electrophoretic mobility and two-dimensional oligonucleotide pattern from viroid circles extracted from infected plants. In light of recent evidence for multimeric viroid replication intermediates, cleavage followed by RNA ligation by a cellular enzyme may (i) be a normal step in the viroid life cycle and (ii) may also reflect cellular events."

Past vegetational patterns show associations that cannot be attributed to simple elevational displacement of the modern zones. A model emphasizing a latitudinal shift of climatic values is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2131447826,"Since 1978 and 1979, California has had a significantly higher frequency of moderate to large earthquakes than in the preceding 25 years. In the past such periods have also been associated with major destructive earthquakes, of magnitude 7 or greater, and the annual probability of occurrence of such an event is now 13 percent in California. The increase in seismicity is associated with a marked deviation in the pattern of strain accumulation, a correlation that is physically plausible. Although great earthquakes (magnitude greater than 7.5) are too infrequent to have clear associations with any pattern of seismicity that is now observed, the San Andreas fault in southern California has accumulated sufficient potential displacement since the last rupture in 1857 to generate a great earthquake along part or all of its length."
https://openalex.org/W2049678998,"Census data confirm that in the 1970's population grew more rapidly outside than inside metropolitan territory, reversing a historic pattern. The new data reveal that the dispersion of population growth beyond metropolitan areas was not so much a movement to small towns as a movement to the open countryside. The trends appear strong enough to suggest a new shift toward rural life-styles."

https://openalex.org/W2040128262,Recent upgrading projects have extended the mass range of particles that can be accelerated at the Bevalac to include any element of the periodic table to energies above 1 billion electron volts per atomic mass unit. This capability was verified on 11 May 1982 with the production of a uranium beam at 147.7 million electron volts per atomic mass unit.

https://openalex.org/W2093063123,The cross section for the breakup of relativistic uranium projectiles (energy âˆ¼ 35 billion electron volts) into two large fragments in the track detector CR-39 was measured and found to be about half of the geometric cross section. The range of the uranium projectiles was also measured and found to agree with that predicted by the Bethe theory when modified to account for the capture of orbital electrons by the projectiles.

https://openalex.org/W2012447882,The acceleration and extraction of uranium-238 nuclei by the Bevalac have been confirmed by their visual detection in nuclear research emulsion. A preliminary result for the collision mean free path for stopping uranium-238 (energy </= 115 million electron volts per nucleon) is 3.1 +/- 0.6 centimeters. Qualitative characteristics of the observed uranium-nucleus collisions are also described.
