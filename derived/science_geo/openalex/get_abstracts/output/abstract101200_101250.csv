Recent studies suggest that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. These studies have placed the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular protein tyrosine kinase, in a central position in integrin-initiated signal transduction pathways (Zachary, I., and Rozengurt, E.(1992) Cell 71, 891-894; [Medline] Schaller, M., and Parsons, J. T. (1993) Trends Cell Biol. 3, 258-262). Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with the cytoskeletal protein talin in NIH 3T3 cells. We have identified a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. These studies suggest talin may be a mediator for FAK activation in signaling initiated by integrins and may provide an explanation for the dependence on the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton of multiple intracellular signaling pathways converging to FAK activation and autophosphorylation.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 1The abbreviations used are: FAKfocal adhesion kinasePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorGSTglutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: FAKfocal adhesion kinasePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorGSTglutathione S-transferase. is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase localized in focal contacts(1Zachary I.

Consistent with its subcellular localization, FAK has been implicated in signal transduction pathways initiated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. FAK becomes rapidly phosphorylated in response to cell attachment to fibronectin-coated surfaces or integrin clustering by antibodies(4Guan J.-L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O.

Integrin clustering on the cell surface also stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK in both fibroblasts and platelets(7Guan J.-L. Shalloway D.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In addition, transformation of fibroblasts by v-Src results in an elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, associated with increased kinase activity(7Guan J.-L. Shalloway D.

Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was recently shown to be modulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (19Rankin S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 704-710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysophosphatidic acid, a platelet-derived phospholipid that elicits a wide variety of cellular responses in diverse cell types by acting on its receptor coupled to G-proteins(20Moolenaar W.H.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Therefore, FAK activation and phosphorylation are likely to be a point of convergence of multiple intracellular signaling pathways(1Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Schaller M. Parsons J.T.

The mechanism of FAK activation in response to various stimuli is poorly understood(2Schaller M. Parsons J.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Inactivation of protein kinase C by a number of methods does not block increase in FAK phosphorylation stimulated by neuropeptides, although treatment of cells with protein kinase C activators lead to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK(22Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inactivation of p21rho by ADP-ribosylation with botulinum C3 exoenzyme blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK induced by lysophosphatidic acid (23Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or bombesin and endothelin(24Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, if p21rho is involved in FAK activation by integrins. Studies using cytochalasin D, which selectively disrupts the networks of actin filaments, show that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for increased phosphorylation of FAK in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli(6Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 22Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrins have been shown to interact with the actin cytoskeleton via their direct binding to two cytoskeletal proteins talin and α-actinin(25Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 26Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the cytoskeletal proteins colocalized with FAK and integrins in the focal contacts may be involved in mediating FAK activation by integrins. Here, we report data suggesting a possible association of FAK with talin in NIH 3T3 cells and the identification of a 48-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK necessary for talin binding in vitro. Furthermore, we have correlated the ability of integrin to induce FAK phosphorylation with its ability to bind talin using a mutant integrin lacking the carboxyl-terminal 13 amino acids. Protein A-Sepharose 4B, glutathione-agarose beads, Ponceau S, and monoclonal antibody against talin were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit antiserum against PDGF receptor was from UBI. Antisera against talin and vinculin were kind gifts of Dr. R. O. Hynes (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and monoclonal antibody (12CA5) against an epitope of the hemagglutinin (HA1) protein of the influenza virus was a kind gift of Dr. Q. Yu (Boston University Medical School). Rabbit anti-FAK serum was prepared as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells or insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells were maintained as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitory unit/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin) as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Lysates from NIH 3T3 cells (500 μg) or Sf21 cells (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated by incubation with 3 μl of various antisera for 1 h at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose and washed four times in lysis buffer. They were then boiled for 3 min in SDS-sample buffer and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed with monoclonal anti-talin antibody (1:1000 dilution) or 12CA5 (1:1000 dilution) using the Amersham electrochemiluminescence system, as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The various FAK mutants have been previously described(28Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Two complementary synthetic oligonucleotides encoding an epitope derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin sequence (YPYDVPDYA, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5) were ligated to the 5′-end of the FAK coding sequence, replacing 29 amino acid residues. Epitope-tagged FAK or its mutants were cloned into expression vector pBlueBac2 (Invitrogen). These were then transfected into Sf21 cells along with the linear genomic DNA of baculoviruses, and the recombinant viruses were harvested and used to infect Sf21 for recombinant protein production, as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding chicken integrin β1 and the Δ4 mutant have been previously described(29Marcantonio E.E. Guan J-L. Trevithick J. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments containing the cytoplasmic domains of the wild type or mutant chicken integrin β1 were excised by digestions with BclI and PvuII and inserted into the cloning site of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) after digestions with BamHI and SmaI. The resulting plasmids were used to generate in-frame fusion proteins GST-cytoβ1wt and GST-cytoβ1Δ4, respectively, as previously described(27Xing Z. Chen H.-C. Nowlen J.K. Taylor S. Shalloway D. Guan J.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). For talin-FAK binding assays, cellular talin from 500 μg of NIH 3T3 cell lysates were immobilized on protein A beads by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-talin serum. Talin-bound beads were further incubated with 100 μg of recombinant virus-infected Sf21 cell lysates in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 2 h at 4°C. The bound recombinant FAK or mutants were eluted in SDS sample buffer, resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with 12CA5. The membranes were then washed in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 55°C for 30 min and reblotted with anti-talin antibody to show that similar amounts of talin were present in the binding assays. Aliquots of lysates (15 μg) containing recombinant proteins were also analyzed directly by Western blotting with 12CA5 to show that similar amounts of recombinant FAK and mutants were used in the binding assays. In some experiments, SDS was added to the cell lysates (final concentration, 2%) prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The lysates with SDS were then boiled for 5 min to disrupt potential associations of talin with other proteins. The samples were cooled and diluted (10-fold) in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-talin serum or normal rabbit serum to prepare for immobilized talin in binding assays. For talin-integrin binding assays, about 5 μg of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins were immobolized on glutathione beads and then incubated with 1 mg of NIH 3T3 cell lysates in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer overnight at 4°C. The bound complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-talin antibody. The membranes were then stained with Ponceau S to show that similar amounts of fusion proteins were present in the binding assays. To study the role of FAK in integrin signaling, we searched for FAK-interacting proteins that may mediate FAK activation in response to integrin aggregation in cell adhesion. Because both integrins and FAK are localized in focal contacts, we were particularly interested in potential interactions of FAK with other cytoskeletal proteins localized in focal contacts. To examine the potential association of FAK with talin, coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins was performed using lysates prepared from NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, talin is present in the anti-FAK immunoprecipitates (lane 3), which comigrates with the intact talin as precipitated by anti-talin serum (lane 4). Densitometry of the fluorograms showed that about 3-5% of cellular talin was associated with FAK. Another band that migrates slightly faster than the intact talin was also detected in anti-talin precipitates, which probably represents the large proteolytic fragment of talin (lane 4)(30Rees D.J.G. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Talin was not detected in immunoprecipitates of preimmune anti-FAK serum (lane 1) or antiserum against PDGF receptor (lane 2), showing the specificity of talin association with FAK. Consistent with previous reports on their interaction in vitro(31Horwitz A. Duggan K. Greggs R. Decker C. Buck C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), talin was also detected in anti-vinculin immnoprecipitates (lane 5). Taken together, these data suggested the possible association of FAK with talin in vivo. To determine the regions of FAK necessary for association with talin, recombinant FAK and a series of its mutants were produced in insect cells by baculovirus expression systems. These mutants have been previously described (28Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and are designated here as kd (kinase-defective, Lys-454 mutated to Arg), ΔN (deletion of amino acids 50-376), ΔC1 (deletion of amino acids 721-857), ΔC2 (deletion of amino acids 853-963), and ΔC3 (deletion of amino acids 965-1012), respectively (Fig. 2A). To facilitate the detection and purification of the recombinant proteins, an oligonucleotide encoding an epitope derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin sequence (YPYDVPDYA, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 12CA5) was fused to the amino terminus of FAK or its mutants, replacing 29 amino acid residues. The epitope-tagged recombinant FAK and mutants were expressed in insect Sf21 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No endogenous FAK was expressed in Sf21 cells (data not shown), and the epitope-tagged recombinant proteins can be detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FAK serum followed by Western blotting with 12CA5 (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation of the recombinant proteins followed by in vitro kinase assays indicated that recombinant FAK and all deletion mutants exhibited kinase activities (data not shown), indicating that gross alterations in conformation were unlikely for these recombinant proteins. No kinase activity was observed for kd, as expected (data not shown). However, proper folding of this mutant is likely because it can bind to talin (see Fig. 3 and below).Figure 3:In vitro association of talin and recombinant FAK. A, aliquots of lysates from infected insect cells were analyzed by Western blotting using 12CA5 to verify that similar amounts of input were used in binding assays for all samples. B, cellular talin was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads by anti-talin immunoprecipitation and then incubated with various recombinant FAK proteins. The bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot with 12CA5. C, the same membrane was stripped and reprobed using anti-talin monoclonal antibody to verify that similar amounts of talin were present in all samples in the binding experiments. Abbreviations used are as described in theFig. 2 legend.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In vitro binding assays were performed using cell lysates prepared from Sf21 cells infected with various recombinant viruses encoding FAK or its mutants. An aliquot of each sample was analyzed by Western blotting with 12CA5 to show that a similar amount of recombinant proteins was expressed in insect cells (Fig. 3A). The remaining samples were incubated with cellular talin immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-talin serum. After washing, the bound proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting with 12CA5. As shown in Fig. 3B, all recombinant proteins except ΔC3 bound to talin. Western blotting of the same membranes showed that similar amounts of talin were present in all samples (Fig. 3C). None of the recombinant proteins bound to control beads where normal rabbit serum was used for talin immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These data indicated that amino acids 965-1012 of FAK (deleted in ΔC3) were necessary for binding talin immobilized on beads. Binding of recombinant FAK to talin-coated beads could be due to its direct binding to talin or mediated by other proteins that are associated with talin. For example, vinculin has been shown to be associated with talin (31Horwitz A. Duggan K. Greggs R. Decker C. Buck C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and is present in anti-talin immunoprecipitates under our experimental conditions (see Fig. 4). To distinguish these two possibilities, cell lysates were boiled in SDS to disrupt any protein-protein associations before immunoprecipitations by anti-talin serum (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 4, vinculin could no longer be detected in talin-coated beads prepared from the treated lysates (compare lanes 1 and 2). Other potential talin-binding proteins such as α-actinin and paxillin could not be detected in anti-talin immunoprecipitates even before the treatment under our experimental conditions (data not shown). It is also unlikely that any other proteins were still associated with talin after boiling in SDS of the cell lysates. Nevertheless, recombinant FAK bound to talin-coated beads prepared from boiled lysates as efficiently as that from untreated lysates (compare lanes 4 and 6). The recombinant FAK did not bind to control beads where normal rabbit serum was used for talin immunoprecipitation (lanes 3 and 5). Taken together, these results suggest that FAK likely binds to talin directly in vitro and possibly to a contiguous stretch of amino acids on talin. Previous data from our laboratory and others have implicated that the carboxyl-terminal amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 is responsible for intracellular signaling, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK(4Guan J.-L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the ability of integrin to activate FAK is correlated with its binding to talin, two integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain-derived GST fusion proteins were produced in bacteria, including an intact cytoplasmic domain (GST-cytoβ1wt) and a truncated mutant (GST-cytoβ1Δ4). The mutant lacked 13 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of integrin β1 cytoplasmic domain and was unable to induce FAK tyrosine phosphorylation(4Guan J.-L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and further incubated with NIH 3T3 cell lysates. After washing, the bound protein complexes were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot with anti-talin. As shown in Fig. 5A, talin was precipitated by GST-cytoβ1wt but not GST alone or GST-cytoβ1Δ4. Ponceau S staining of the same membranes showed that similar amounts of the fusion proteins were present in all samples (Fig. 5B). These results correlate integrin binding to talin and its ability to induce FAK phosphorylation, which is consistent with the notion that talin-FAK interaction plays a role in integrin-mediated signaling. The results presented here suggest a possible association of FAK with a cytoskeletal protein talin. This association was observed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitations and in vitro by binding of recombinant FAK to immobilized cellular talin. Evidence for direct association of talin to FAK was obtained using talin from SDS-denatured NIH 3T3 lysates in in vitro binding assays (Fig. 4). These results suggest a possible mechanism for FAK activation and tyrosine phosphorylation by integrins because the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 interacts with talin (Ref. 25 and Fig. 5). The binding of talin to the kinase-deficient FAK is as effective as that to the wild type FAK (Fig. 3), indicating that the possible association of talin with FAK is independent of FAK activation and phosphorylation. This is consistent with the proposal that talin is an upstream mediator of FAK activation by integrins but not a downstream effector of FAK activation. The potential association of FAK with talin observed here may also help to explain previous observations that disruption of actin-cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D could block FAK phosphorylation in several situations(6Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 22Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FAK activation and tyrosine phosphorylation have been implicated as a point of convergence in the actions of integrins, oncoproteins encoding tyrosine kinases, and neuropeptides with receptors coupled to G-proteins(1Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 2Schaller M. Parsons J.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cross-talk among these diverse pathways are still unclear at present. However, the integrity of actin-cytoskeleton seems to play a role in FAK responses to all of these stimuli, and the actin-disrupting drug cytochalasin D could block FAK phosphorylation in all of these situations(6Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 22Sinnett-Smith J. Zachary I. Valverde A.M. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14261-14268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the actin cytoskeleton may be involved in integrating these diverse signals, which is then relayed to FAK by talin. Using a series of chicken integrin β1 mutants expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, Lewis and Schwartz (34Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have recently shown in vivo the correlated localization of talin, FAK, and actin, as induced by microbeads coated with anti-integrin antibodies. The colocalization of these three proteins with integrin all requires the presence of amino acids 791-799 in the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin. These observations are consistent with our present results, suggesting a role for talin in FAK activation by integrins. Indeed, talin did not bind the GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of integrin mutant Δ4 (the same mutant as Δ790 used by Lewis and Schwartz; see Ref. 29), which lacked amino acids 791-803, under our experimental conditions that allowed its efficient binding to the GST fusion protein containing the entire cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin (Fig. 5). Previous studies also showed that the same mutant was neither localized to focal contacts (29Marcantonio E.E. Guan J-L. Trevithick J. Hynes R.O.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tapley et al.(35Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar) have identified that amino acids 780-789 of the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin could bind to talin in vitro. This sequence lies adjacent to amino acids 791-799 discussed above, and as Lewis and Schwartz suggested(34Lewis J.M. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), amino acids from both segments could form one talin binding site in vivo. Removal of amino acids 790-799 may weaken the affinity sufficiently to prevent association in vivo. This may account for the inability of the Δ4 mutant to activate FAK in vivo(4Guan J.-L. Trevithick L.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We have identified amino acids 965-1012 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of FAK (deleted in ΔC3) necessary for talin binding. These amino acids have also been found previously to be necessary for FAK localization to focal contacts(28Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, talin may be one of the FAK binding proteins responsible for its targeting to the focal contacts. However, interaction with talin alone may not be sufficient for FAK localization to focal contacts because FAKΔC2 was not localized to focal contacts(28Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), although it could bind talin in vitro (Fig. 3). It is possible that interaction of FAK with more than one protein in multimolecular complexes in vivo is necessary for its proper localization in the focal contacts and/or for its activation and signaling. Interestingly, Miyamoto et al. (36) have recently shown that integrin clustering by a non-inhibitory antibody coated on the beads induced colocalization of tensin and FAK but not other cytoskeletal proteins. It is unclear, however, which region of FAK is responsible for its association with tensin. Recently, FAK has also been shown to bind to another cytoskeletal protein, paxillin(37Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although paxillin can interact with talin via vinculin (32), it is unlikely that FAK associates with talin via its binding to paxillin because FAKΔC2, which does not bind paxillin,2 2Hildebrand, J. D., Schaller, M. D., and Parsons, J. T. (1995) Mol. Biol. Cell.6, in press could associate with talin efficiently (Fig. 3). Experiments are in progress to determine more precisely the binding sites on FAK for these various cytoskeletal proteins and to determine relative contributions of these interactions to the activation and tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK. We are grateful to Dr. R. O. Hynes for antisera against talin and vinculin, Dr. Q. Yu for monoclonal antibody 12CA5, and Mike Dolenga for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful comments."

Nucleotide-induced changes in DnaK conformation were investigated by monitoring changes in tryptic digestion pattern and tryptophan fluorescence. Using nucleotide-free DnaK preparations, not only the known ATP-induced major changes in kinetics and pattern of proteolysis but also minor ADP-induced changes were detected.

Hsp70 proteins are composed of a highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain of 44 kDa and a C-terminal substrate binding domain of 25 kDa (18-20) (Fig. 1). The three-dimensional structure of the ATPase domain of the bovine Hsc70 homolog has been resolved to 2.2-Å resolution(21Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). It consists of two quasisymmetric subdomains separated by a nucleotide binding cleft and connected by two crossed helices. These helices are proposed to serve as a hinge that mediates nucleotide-dependent opening and closing of the nucleotide-binding cleft. ATP-induced changes in fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue of DnaK located in the ATPase domain have been interpreted as indication of such an ATPase subdomain movement (22). The C-terminal domain consists of a well conserved 15-kDa subdomain adjacent to the ATPase domain that probably comprises the substrate binding site(18Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang T.-F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol.

Little is known about the mechanism of coupling between the cycle of substrate binding/release and the ATPase activity. At a functional level, coupling is manifested by the mutual stimulation of ATPase activity and substrate release(5Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments established that the mere binding of ATP is sufficient to cause efficient substrate release from DnaK(6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP converts DnaK from an ATP-bound form, characterized by high on and off rates of substrate interactions, to an ADP-bound form, characterized by low on and off rates(10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 27Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of DnaK thus constitutes a switch regulating the velocity and stability of substrate binding by DnaK. At a structural level, ATP-induced conformational changes in DnaK were detected by means of ATP-induced changes in pattern of proteolysis and in infrared and fluorescence spectra(22Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A correlation between hydrolysis of ATP, alteration in the degradation pattern, and release of a prebound model substrate, bovine pancreas trypsin inhibitor, was reported for DnaK(26Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent finding that the binding of ATP is sufficient to trigger substrate release raises the question whether it is also sufficient to trigger conformational changes in DnaK, e.g. in the substrate binding region, which then induce substrate release. To investigate the mechanism of coupling between ATPase activity and substrate interaction, we analyzed conformational changes in DnaK induced by nucleotides and cofactors. This was achieved by monitoring changes in proteolytic degradation and tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK. Evidence is presented for major conformational changes in the substrate binding region of DnaK induced by the binding of ATP, and in the ATPase domain induced by ADP and ATP, respectively. The detected ATP-induced conformational changes depended on the interaction of the ATPase domain with the substrate binding region of DnaK. The presented data provide an insight into the structural basis of the coupling of ATPase activity with substrate binding. DnaK+, DnaK1-386, DnaK163, and N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged DnaK387-638 were purified as described (28Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) after overproduction in ΔdnaK52 cells(29Bukau B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2337-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE were purified as described previously(30Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The DnaK163 mutant protein lacks the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues of DnaK due to an amber mutation in the dnaK163 allele.2 DnaK-T199A was purified as described previously (32). Nucleotide-free preparations of DnaK were obtained by a procedure to be published elsewhere.3 3H. Theyssen, B. Bukau, and J. Reinstein, manuscript in preparation. The absence of bound nucleotides was verified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis using a C18 column.3 Partial tryptic degradation of DnaK was performed as described previously(8Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, DnaK (4.3 μM) was preincubated in buffer T (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8 mM mg(OAc)2, 20 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 0.3 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT) (8Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) at 30°C for 30 min in the presence or absence of nucleotides (ATP, Sigma; ADP, Waldhof Chemie, Mannheim). Identical degradation patterns were obtained after 5 min or 2 h of preincubation, respectively. Proteolysis was started by the addition of 0.15 μg of trypsin (Merck, Darmstadt). At various time points, aliquots were taken and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar) or 16.5% Tricine4 4The abbbreviations used are: TricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl glycineCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidmAbmonoclonal antibodyATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)AMP-PNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphatemAbmonoclonal antibody. step-gel electrophoresis (34Schägger H. von Jagow G.

The monoclonal antibodies K3-1 and K2-4 were obtained by standard methods from Balb/c mouse spleen cells immunized with DnaK antigen and PAI myeloma cells. DnaK-specific hybridomas were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analyses. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on Protein G-Sepharose. DnaK (60 μg) was preincubated with or without 5 mM ATP for 30 min at 30°C. After the addition of trypsin (1.3 μg), partial proteolysis was allowed to proceed for 10 min (without ATP) and 4 min (with ATP), respectively, and stopped by addition of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (3 mM, final concentration) and 2 × protein sample buffer. The samples were immediately boiled and separated on 12.5% Laemmli and 16% Tricine step gels. The bands were electroblotted onto Selex PP membrane (Schleicher and Schüll) with 10 mM CAPS4/NaOH, pH 11, 10% methanol blotting buffer. The membranes were stained with naphthol blue black (Sigma, 0.1% (w/v) in 10% methanol, 2% acetic acid), and destained in 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid. The fragments of interest were excised and sequenced on an ABI protein sequencer model 473A using standard methodology. Measurements of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK were performed on a SML “Smart” 8100 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter. Nucleotide-free DnaK (2 μM) was analyzed at 25°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM dithioerythrol. Emission was recorded at a fixed excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Spectra in the presence of ATP were recorded after the addition of ATP from a concentrated stock solution (744 μM, final concentration) and 5-min incubation in the cuvette. Under these conditions, ∥99% of the enzyme is saturated with ATP, whereas ∤1% of the substrate has been turned over(10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).3 Limited proteolysis has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for the detection of functional domains and nucleotide-induced conformational changes in various Hsp70 proteins (18, 26, 36). On the basis of previous work, we extended limited proteolysis of DnaK to further dissect the conformational changes that are induced by nucleotides and cofactors. Compared with published procedures, we introduced three changes that were crucial for detection of previously undiscovered conformational changes. First, we used as starting material a nucleotide-free preparation of DnaK instead of standard preparations that presumably have nucleotides bound with a stoichiometry of up to 1:1(37Gao B. Emato Y. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8507-8513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10050-10056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, SDS-polyacrylamide gels of proteolytic digests of DnaK were subjected to highly sensitive silver staining according to Blum(35Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar), which allows detection of minor proteolytic fragments. Third, fragments smaller than 20 kDa were identified by separation in a 16.5% Tricine gel system(34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of partial trypsin digestion of DnaK in the absence or presence of ATP and ADP after separation of the degradation products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the absence of nucleotide, degradation was relatively slow and yielded major fragments of 55, 46, 44, 33, 31, and, as revealed by use of the 16.5% Tricine gel system, 18 and 14.5 kDa apparent molecular masses (Fig. 2). Addition of ATP accelerated degradation significantly and changed the fragment pattern in that (i) the 46-kDa fragment became by far the most prominent product, (ii) the 33-, 31-, 14.5-, and 18-kDa fragments almost completely disappeared, (iii) new 21- and 53-kDa fragments were produced transiently, (iv) a 16-kDa fragment became much more prominent. It is important to note that the apparent lack of the 21- and 53-kDa fragments in the absence of ATP makes these fragments the most intriguing indicators of ATP-induced conformational changes in DnaK. The ATP-induced changes in kinetics and pattern of proteolysis of DnaK described here are consistent with those reported by Liberek et al.(26Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the use of the Tricine gel system resulted in better resolution of smaller fragments and allowed us to identify additional fragments (14.5, 16, and 21 kDa) that appear or disappear in dependence of ATP. Addition of ADP to nucleotide-free DnaK did not accelerate proteolysis and did not cause the major changes in proteolysis pattern found for ATP, as judged by the lack of the 21- and 53-kDa fragments (Fig. 2, upper panel). However, the fragment pattern obtained in presence of ADP is distinct from the pattern of nucleotide-free DnaK in that (i) the 14.5- and 18-kDa fragments disappeared, (ii) the 33- and 31-kDa fragments were less populated, and (iii) the 46-kDa fragment was more populated (Fig. 2). These ADP-induced changes in the proteolysis pattern of DnaK escaped previous detection, possibly because DnaK preparations were used that contained significant amounts of prebound ADP. Together, our data suggest that DnaK can adopt at least three distinct conformational states that are determined by the absence of nucleotide, bound ADP, and bound ATP. The recent finding that ATP hydrolysis is not needed for efficient substrate release by DnaK (6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether it is needed for the ATP-induced conformational changes in DnaK described above. In one approach we tested whether an ATPase-deficient DnaK mutant protein, DnaK-T199A(32McCarty J.S. Walker G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9513-9517Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which has retained the ability to release bound substrates upon ATP addition(6Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), also exhibits the conformational changes found in DnaK+ upon ATP addition. For this purpose, we subjected the DnaK-T199A mutant protein to partial trypsin digestion in the presence and absence of nucleotides. The kinetics and the pattern of proteolysis of the DnaK-T199A mutant protein were indistinguishable from those found for DnaK+ (Fig. 3). In particular, the 53-, 46-, 21-, and 16-kDa fragments indicative of DnaK+ in the presence of ATP were also found for the mutant protein. This result demonstrates that ATP hydrolysis is not essential for the ATP-induced major conformational changes in DnaK. The ATPase activity of DnaK is stimulated by substrates(6Palleros D.R.

We investigated the possibility that the stimulating activity of these factors involves induction of conformational changes in DnaK leading to alterations in the kinetics and the pattern of proteolysis of DnaK. In the absence of nucleotides (data not shown), the kinetics and pattern of trypsin digestion of DnaK were not detectably altered by the addition of DnaJ and GrpE at relative stoichiometries of 1:10 and 1:1, respectively, or of saturating amounts (10 μM) of a model substrate of DnaK, peptide C of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein(5Flynn G.C. Chappell T.G. Rothman J.E. Science. 1989; 245: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Failure to detect conformational changes in DnaK did not result from premature tryptic digestion of these cofactors since increase in the amounts of DnaJ and GrpE did not significantly change the results. In contrast, in the presence of ATP, the addition of DnaJ changed the degradation pattern of DnaK toward a pattern normally found in the presence of ADP, i.e. disappearance of the 21-kDa fragment and decrease in abundance of the 53 kDa fragment (Fig. 4). Since in this experiment DnaJ was added to DnaK at substoichiometric (1:10) amounts, DnaJ is unlikely to induce these conformational changes in DnaK by complex formation. The most likely interpretation is that DnaJ, which stimulates the DnaK ATPase activity by acceleration of the rate-limiting step, γ-phosphate cleavage(9Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), 1 causes efficient conversion of DnaK-bound ATP to ADP. This is consistent with the finding that in the presence of DnaJ more than 95% of DnaK-bound nucleotide is found as ADP under steady state conditions(10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). It is important to note that our finding argues strongly against ATP hydrolysis being required for the ATP-induced major conformational changes in DnaK (26Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and supports our results showing that it is ATP binding that causes the observed significant conformational changes in DnaK. In the case of peptide C substrate, the addition of a 2-fold molar excess in the presence of ATP induced a conformational change in DnaK that was qualitatively similar, but much weaker, to the effect found with DnaJ (data not shown). This observed slight change in DnaK conformation to an ADP-like form probably results from the limited potential of peptide C to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK by accelerating γ-phosphate cleavage(10McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar).1 We cannot, however, exclude that the proteolysis pattern is affected due to direct protection of cleavage sites within the substrate binding region of DnaK (see below) by peptide C. In the case of GrpE, the addition of equimolar amounts of GrpE to nucleotide-free DnaK in the presence of ATP did not cause significant changes in the tryptic degradation pattern of DnaK (data not shown). This suggests that GrpE does not induce major conformational changes in DnaK detectable by the method used. It cannot be ruled out, however, that short-lived interactions between GrpE and DnaK exist in the presence of ATP that involve significant alterations in DnaK structure. To gain insights into the structural basis of the nucleotide-induced conformational changes of DnaK, we assigned the major tryptic fragments to DnaK subdomains by immunological characterization and N-terminal sequencing. For immunological characterization, monoclonal antibodies with specificity for DnaK were prepared and used to identify fragments carrying C- and N-terminal epitopes. We specifically used the monoclonal antibodies (mAb) K3-1 and K2-4, which recognize epitopes in the ATPase domain and the proposed C-terminal substrate binding region (within 153 amino acids immediately following the ATPase domain), respectively. These epitope specificities were determined by immunoblot analysis using fragments of DnaK comprising the ATPase domain (DnaK1-385; recognized by K3-1) and the C-terminal domain (DnaK386-638; recognized by K2-4) and the DnaK163 mutant protein lacking the carboxyl-terminal 100 residues2 (recognized by K2-4 and K3-1) (Fig. 5A). Based on previous work on proteolysis of Hsc70 (18Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we expected that the 46-kDa fragment, which is increased in abundance in the presence of ATP, comprises the ATPase domain of DnaK, and that the 55- and 53-kDa fragments share this domain and protrude carboxyl-terminally to different extents into the substrate binding region. We confirmed this assumption by immunoblot analysis and microsequencing (Fig. 5B). All three fragments were recognized by the ATPase domain-specific mAb K3-1 and start with the second amino acid of the N-terminal sequence of DnaK. The N-terminal formylmethionine residue of DnaK is apparently cleaved off in vivo. Interestingly, the mAb K2-4 recognizes the 55-kDa fragment of DnaK but not the 53-kDa fragment, indicating that its epitope is located near the C-terminal end of the substrate binding domain around residue 500. Note that the prominent 46-kDa fragment is slightly larger than the 44-kDa ATPase domain of DnaK, DnaK 1-385, that we constructed by polymerase chain reaction-based cloning of the part of dnaK that encodes the DnaK equivalent of the Hsc70 ATPase domain structure(21Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Since the C-terminal domain starts near the minor trypsin cleavage site Lys-387 (see below), the 46-kDa fragment is most likely the product of a major tryptic cut at the first cleavage site in the C-terminal domain at Lys-414. According to secondary structure prediction using the PHD program(42Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar, 43Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), this residue is located in an unstructured/loop region (data not shown). The 31- and 33-kDa fragments enriched in the absence of ATP were recognized by mAb K2-4 and therefore contain C-terminal sequences. Microsequencing revealed that the N terminus of the 31-kDa fragment is at the border between the ATPase domain and the C-terminal domain at residue Asp-388 and t"

Notably, PA and/or PA receptor expression is consistently observed at the invasive front of both spontaneous and experimentally-induced cancers.

The uPA receptor (uPAR) is increasingly recognized as an important factor in focusing plasmin-mediated pericellular proteolysis. uPAR is a 55-70 kDa glycoprotein that is attached to the plasma membrane through a post-translationally added glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor(21Ploug M.R.E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein contains three cysteine-rich domains that are similar to elements found in the Ly-6 superfamily of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, whose members include the murine Ly-6 antigens(22Friedman S. Palfree R.G.E. Sirlin S. Hammerling U. Immunogenetics. 1990; 31: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Palfree R.G.E. Immunol.

Virology. 1992; 190: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain of uPAR is known to mediate uPA binding(27Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the function of the two other domains remains to be elucidated. uPAR binds uPA ligand with both high specificity and affinity (Kd 10−9 to 10−10M) through the uPA “growth factor-like” domain (28Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stopelli M.D. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and directs uPA activity to the leading edge of migrating cells(29Estreicher A. Mühlhauser J. Carpentier J.L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the receptor potentiates uPA-mediated plasminogen activation by increasing the rate of pro-uPA activation (by plasmin), reducing the apparent Km of uPA for plasminogen substrate, and increasing the apparent kcat for plasminogen activation(30Ellis V. Danø K. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 6: 27-34Google Scholar). Consistent with the broad utility of plasmin-mediated proteolysis, uPAR has been identified on many diverse types of cells, including monocytes and macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, trophoblasts, and many types of tumor cells(3Danø K.

Interestingly, uPAR, like many other glycosylphosphatidylinositol proteins(37Stefanova I. Horejsi V. Ansotegui I.J. Knapp W. Stockinger H. Science. 1991; 254: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), may participate in signal transduction, including directing uPA-dependent changes in protein phosphorylation and cell proliferation(38Dumler I. Petri T. Schleuning W.D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Rabbani S.A. Desjardins J. Bell A.W. Banville D. Mazar A. Henkin J. Goltzman D. Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which uPAR might alter intracellular events has not yet been established. In addition to focusing uPA activity, uPAR also appears to be critical in the ultimate clearance of uPA·inhibitor complexes from the cell surface(40Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Williams S.E. Argraves W.S. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8: 204-215Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have suggested that uPAR may have additional roles not directly related to plasminogen activation. For example, uPAR appears to bind the extracellular matrix protein, vitronectin, through a region outside of the amino-terminal uPA-binding domain(41Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction was shown to influence the adhesion properties and morphology of cultured cells even in the absence of uPA(41Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, uPAR appears to be required for chemotaxis of human monocytes in vitro in a manner independent of the uPA ligand (42). In order to clarify the physiological and pathological roles of uPAR in vivo, we recently isolated the murine uPAR gene (43Suh T.T. Nerlov C. Danø K. Degen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25992-25998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and now report the use of this cloned DNA to generate uPAR-deficient mice. A uPAR targeting vector was generated using a fragment of the mouse 129 strain uPAR gene(43Suh T.T. Nerlov C. Danø K. Degen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25992-25998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 5550-bp EcoRI fragment containing the portion of the uPAR gene extending from +1080 (intron 1; converted BglII site) to +6630 (intron 3) was isolated from ΛuPARg-1 (43Suh T.T. Nerlov C. Danø K.

A 2-kb ClaI cassette encoding herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase was inserted into the plasmid polylinker ClaI site immediately upstream of the intron 1 sequences to provide a means of selection against non-homologous recombination(44Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Finally, a 1-kb BamHI fragment containing exon 3 (43Suh T.T. Nerlov C. Danø K. Degen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25992-25998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was removed and substituted with a 6-kb BamHI cassette encoding human HPRT (45Reid L.H. Gregg R.G. Smithies O. Koller B.H.

Vector-free targeting vector DNA (40 μg) was introduced by electroporation (800 V/cm and 200 microfarads; IBI GeneZapper) into HPRT-deficient E14TG2a (46Hooper M.L. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S.

Drug-resistant clones were picked after 7 days, expanded in 24-well dishes, and DNA extracts were prepared and tested by PCR using a primer complementary to the HPRT cassette (OligoHPRT-1; 5′-TATTACCAGTGAATCTTTGTCAGCAG-3′; Ref. 45) and a primer complementary to a uPAR intron 3 sequence (OligoPAR-25; 5′-GAACCAGTGAGCCAACC-3′; corresponding to +6755 to +6771 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43). Correct targeting of two PCR-positive clones was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization analyses using exon 1- and exon 2-specific hybridization probes and genomic DNA digests prepared with three different restriction enzymes (HindIII, PvuII, and BglII). Each clone was injected into the blastocoel cavity of C57BL/6 blastocysts and subsequently implanted into the uterine horns of pseudo-pregnant females(47Li H. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Aronow B.J.

Chimeric male offspring were mated to NIH Black Swiss mice (Taconic) to generate heterozygous offspring. These mice were then interbred to generate homozygous uPAR−/− progeny. Genotypes of mice were determined using tail biopsy DNA (47Li H. Witte D.P. Branford W.W. Aronow B.J. Weinstein M. Kaur S. Wert S. Singh G. Schreiner C.M. Whitsett J.A. Scott W.J. Potter S.S.

In the Southern blot assays, PvuII- or BglII-digested genomic DNAs were hybridized with either a 108-bp probe complementary to exon 2 or a 77-bp probe complementary to exon 1. The exon 1 probe was generated by PCR using the primer uPAR-E2-5′ (5′-CCTCCCAGGGCCTGCAGTGCA-3′; corresponding to +2640 to +2660 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43) and primer uPAR-E2-3′ (5′-GCCATTCCCGAAGCACGGTAG-3′; corresponding to +2727 to +2747 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43). The exon 2 probe was generated by PCR using the primer uPAR-E1-5′ (5′-AGAGCAGAGGTGAAGGAAGAA-3′; corresponding to +1 to +21 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43) and primer uPAR-E1-3′ (5′-ACACAGGTAGTCGCCAGCAAC-3′; corresponding to +57 to +77 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43). In the PCR-based genotype assays, the targeted uPAR allele was detected using the uPAR intron 3 primer uPAR-I3 (5′-TCATCAGTCCTCCCTGCTAAGGGC-3′; corresponding to +5290 to +5313 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43) and OligoHPRT-1 (see above). The wild-type uPAR allele was detected with exon 3 primers, uPAR-E3-5′ (5′-GATGATAGAGAGCTGGAGGTGGTGAC-3′; corresponding to +4178 to +4203 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43) and uPAR-E3-3′ (5′-CACCGGGTCTGGGCCTGTTGCAGAGGT-3′; corresponding to +4299 to +4325 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43). Total RNA was isolated from the embryonic fibroblasts as described(48Degen J.L. Estensen R.D. Nagamine Y. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12426-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-μg samples were fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to BA85 nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell), and hybridized (49Bell S.M. Brackenbury R.W. Leslie N.D. Degen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1333-1338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled 1500-bp mouse uPAR cDNA probe(50Kristensen P. Eriksen J. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1763-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Equivalent sample loading was verified by UV transillumination of ethidium bromide-stained ribosomal RNAs. Mouse tissue RNA was isolated using Oligotex d(T) (Qiagen), reverse transcribed in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 200 ng of poly(A)+ RNA, 24 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 50 μmol of random hexanucleotide primers, and then PCR amplified using Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) and the uPAR primers, 5′-GCAGTGTGAGAGTAACCAGAGCT-3′ (exon 2; +2662 to +2684 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43) and 5′-CCACAGCCTCGGGTGTAGTCCT-3′ (exon 5; +10084 to +10105 in the gene sequence; Ref. 43). Poly(A)+ RNA isolated from PMA-treated normal mouse skin was used as a positive control. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground into a powder, and Triton X-114 detergent-phase extracts prepared (1 ml of buffer per 100 mg of powdered tissue) as described previously(51Solberg H.L.D. Eriksen J. Ploug M.R.E. Behrendt N. Danø K. H-Hansen G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 451-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Extracted proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to filters, and immunostained (51Solberg H.L.D. Eriksen J. Ploug M.R.E. Behrendt N. Danø K. H-Hansen G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 451-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with either a rabbit antisera raised against uPAR domain 1 peptide (residues 26-45 using the mature protein numbering system; Ref. 43) or domain 2 peptide (residues 126-145 using the mature protein numbering system; Ref. 43). A detailed procedure for the cross-linking of human ATF to uPAR will be published elsewhere.2 2H. Solberg and K. Danø, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, detergent-phase extracts were combined with 125I-labeled human ATF in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 2.5 nM ATF. The mixtures were incubated at 4°C for 1 h and the products covalently cross-linked by addition of 20 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 20 mM sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Pierce) with continued incubation at room temperature for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mM ammonium acetate. The radiolabeled products were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide (10%) gels and detected by autoradiography. In the competition experiments, unlabeled mouse ATF was added to a final concentration of 100 nM prior to addition of labeled ATF. Peritoneal cells, primarily activated macrophages, were collected from lavage fluid prepared from mice 72 h after administration of an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml of thioglycollate medium (Difco). The mice were sacrificed under CO2 narcosis and the peritoneal cavity was flushed with 6 ml of RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were washed once in RPMI 1640 and frozen at −80°C in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% Me2SO until use. 5 × 104 macrophages were seeded in 96-well plates and maintained for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed once in RPMI 1640 and then incubated with 1 nM murine pro-uPA for 15 min at 37°C. The murine pro-uPA used in these incubation mixtures was purified from serum-free conditioned medium of mouse sarcoma virus-transformed 3T3 cells(52Danø K.M.V. Ossowski L. Nielsen L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 613: 542-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 53Skriver L. Nielsen L.S. Stephens R. Danø K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl and 1% bovine serum albumin, once in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl, and finally incubated with human plasminogen (0.5 μM) and the plasmin-specific chromogenic peptide substrate H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroaniline (0.3 mM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.01% Tween 80 (54). Substrate hydrolysis was determined as A405-450 nm in a Molecular Devices Thermo-Max plate reader operating in kinetic mode at 37°C. Peritoneal lavage fluid was collected as described above and the cell pellet and supernatant fractions were separated by a 10-min centrifugation at 2000 × g at 4°C. The pelleted cells were lysed and solubilized directly in polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing 2% SDS but lacking reducing agents. The cell-free supernatant fraction was clarified by centrifugation for 45 min at 17,500 × g at 4°C and then combined with a 2-fold concentrate of gel sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA assay (Pierce). Ten μg of cell-free supernatant protein and 25 μg of cell extract protein were analyzed by zymography using polyacrylamide gels cast with casein and plasminogen as described previously (55Heckel J.L. Sandgren E.P. Degen J.L. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) except 10 mM EDTA was included in gel wash solutions. Pulmonary lavage fluid was prepared from mice anesthetized with 0.1 ml/30 g body weight of ketamine:xylazine:acepromazine (4:1:1). A 19-gauge catheter was inserted into the trachea and tied firmly in position with silk thread. Cold phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml) was gently introduced into the lungs and then withdrawn. The lavage was repeated and the withdrawn fluids combined. The cell pellet and supernatant fractions were prepared as described above. Five μg of cell extract protein and 0.5 μg of supernatant protein were assayed by zymography. Urine was collected directly (void urine) or by bladder puncture of anesthetized mice and 1-μl volumes analyzed by zymography. Plasma was prepared from citrated blood and 1-μl volumes were analyzed by zymography. Void and bladder urine was prepared as described above and aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (esterase assays) and placed in sample buffer containing 2% SDS (immunoblot assays). For immunoblot analyses, 2.5 μl of urine was fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis, and the proteins transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) membranes. Mouse uPA was detected using affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse uPA antibodies (56Larsson L.I. Skriver L. Nielsen L.S. Gr-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Danø K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 896-903Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) and the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) staining system. The uPA esterase activity assays were performed using the uPA-specific chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme-UK (American Diagnostica). Urine samples (2-5 μl) were diluted in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) containing 0.01% Tween 80, 10 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin (Calbiochem), and 2.5 mM Spectrozyme-UK and incubated at 37°C. Samples were read at 405 nm with the rate of substrate conversion still in the linear range. To disrupt the uPAR gene in mice a replacement-type targeting vector was constructed from the cloned murine uPAR gene (Fig. 1). The vector was designed to eliminate the third exon of the uPAR gene which encodes the second half of the amino-terminal uPA-binding domain. Exon 3 and neighboring intron sequences were replaced by a 6-kb selectable marker gene encoding human HPRT (45Reid L.H. Gregg R.G. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4299-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that was oriented in the same direction as the uPAR gene relative to transcription. A herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase minigene was also incorporated to provide the means to select against random integration(44Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The vector was electroporated into the HPRT-deficient embryonic stem cell line E14TG2a (46). Eleven of 86 double-resistant clones (13%) picked for DNA analysis appeared to have incorporated the uPAR targeting vector by homologous recombination when initially screened by PCR (data not shown). Two positive clones were examined by Southern blot hybridization analysis using the probes indicated in Fig. 1, confirming the disruption of the uPAR gene (data not shown). Each of these clonal isolates was microinjected into 3.5-day-old C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric founder mice. Four of 20 chimeric males transmitted the targeted allele to their offspring. Crosses between heterozygous mice resulted in progeny that were homozygous for the targeted allele based on both Southern blot hybridization (for example, see Fig. 2A) and PCR (data not shown).Figure 2:Southern blot and mutant allele transcript analysis. A, representative Southern blot hybridization data with tail biopsy DNA prepared from wild-type (+/+), heterozygous uPAR+/− (+/−), and homozygous uPAR−/− (−/−) mice digested with BglII and hybridized with the exon 2-specific probe indicated inFig. 1 (also see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on the complete nucleotide sequences of the mouse uPAR gene (43) and human HPRT minigene (45) the expected size of the hybridizing BglII fragments from the normal- and targeted-uPAR alleles are 7108 and 4590 bp, r"

To reveal the structural basis for the role of this residue, the additive effects of mutations at this locus and at a conserved helix 7 locus were investigated in the 5-HT2A receptor. All mutant receptors studied retained high affinity agonist and antagonist binding. Whereas an Asp → Asn mutation in helix 2 eliminated coupling, interchanging the residues at the two positions by a second mutation of Asn → Asp in helix 7 restored receptor function. These data suggest that these residues are adjacent in space and interact. The loss of function observed with Ala at either position is consistent with each side chain forming hydrogen bonds. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on three-dimensional computational models of agonist-receptor complexes of both the wild-type receptor and the Asp → Asn mutant receptor. Consonant with the lack of coupling observed for the mutant construct, introducing the mutation into the computational model produced a conformational change in a direction opposite to that seen from computational simulations of activation of the wild-type receptor model.

https://openalex.org/W2026967373,"The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) plays an essential role in intracellular membrane fusion events and has been implicated in the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. NSF binds through soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs) to a complex of neuronal membrane proteins comprised of synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25. Disassembly of this complex by NSF is thought to be a critical step in the molecular events which lead to vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. Here we have studied the interaction of α-SNAP and NSF with individual components of this complex and have identified syntaxin as a primary substrate for NSF/α-SNAP. We find that α-SNAP binds directly to syntaxin 1A as well as weakly to SNAP-25, while it does not bind to synaptobrevin II. NSF binds to syntaxin through α-SNAP and in the presence of ATP catalyzes a conformational rearrangement which abolishes binding of itself and α-SNAP. This reaction leads to the previously described disassembly of the fusion complex, since synaptobrevin binding to syntaxin is also reduced. α-SNAP binds to a carboxyl-terminal syntaxin fragment (residues 194-288) that also binds synaptobrevin and SNAP-25. However, NSF action on this syntaxin fragment has no effect on the binding of α-SNAP or synaptobrevin. This suggests that the conformational change normally induced by NSF in syntaxin depends on an interaction between carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of syntaxin.

Stimulated release of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles is the fundamental process responsible for intercellular communication within the nervous system. In the last few years, major advances have been made in our understanding of synaptic vesicle docking and exocytosis. There is now compelling evidence that neuronal exocytosis operates by the same general mechanism as other intracellular membrane fusion events, with the addition of a specialized regulatory mechanism that enables Ca2+ to rapidly trigger secretion(1Bennett M.K.

Understanding which proteins are involved in neuronal exocytosis and how they work together to bring about membrane fusion is now the focus of considerable effort. Studies of vesicular transport between purified Golgi stacks by Rothman and colleagues (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) led to the isolation and identification of soluble proteins necessary for intracellular membrane fusion.

NSF and the SNAPs have been shown to participate in most intracellular fusion reactions that are amenable to in vitro analysis, and their homologs in yeast are indispensable for vesicular transport through the secretory pathway(2Ferro-Novick S.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). These receptors form a complex that contains the synaptic proteins synaptobrevin (also known as VAMP), syntaxin, and SNAP-25 (synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa)(14Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W.

Synaptobrevin is a small integral membrane protein with a single carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain found at high levels on synaptic vesicles(15Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol.

Syntaxin is likewise an abundant small integral membrane protein with a carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain but is localized primarily on the plasma membrane(17Bennett M.K. Calakos N.

The observation that selective cleavage of each of these three proteins by clostridial neurotoxins leads to a complete blockade in neurotransmission provides strong evidence that they are indeed essential in neuronal exocytosis(21Schiavo G.

There are families of proteins related to synaptobrevin and syntaxin expressed outside of the nervous system with varying subcellular distribution; these related proteins are likely to serve as SNAP receptors for other vesicular fusion events(24Bennett M.K.

Further evidence for involvement of these protein families in membrane trafficking has been provided by studies in yeast, where relatives of synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 have been shown to be essential at several stages in the secretory pathway(2Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Little is known about how NSF, SNAPs, and their membrane receptors actually promote membrane fusion. Some clues, however, have been provided by characterization of the protein-protein interactions between them. In detergent extracts of brain membranes, synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 bind to each other, forming the 7 S SNAP receptor complex(26Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). This SNARE complex binds α-SNAP and NSF to form a 20 S particle which is stable in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog(12Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J.

Since the SNARE complex contains membrane proteins from both the vesicle (v-SNAREs) and the plasma membrane (t-SNAREs), it has been proposed that selectivity in pairing between v- and t-SNAREs may enable a transport vesicle to choose the appropriate target site at which to dock and fuse(26Söllner T.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) suggests that there is selectivity in the pairing of v- and t-SNAREs as they assemble into a SNARE complex. NSF catalyzes dissociation of the 20 S SNARE protein complex in the presence of ATP. In this reaction it releases itself as well as synaptobrevin, SNAP-25 and some α-SNAP from syntaxin(12Wilson D.W.

This disassembly precedes membrane fusion, since assembled SNARE complexes accumulate in yeast secretory mutants deficient in sec18 (NSF) activity(29Sgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of NSF is essential for its role in promoting membrane fusion, since site-directed mutants with impaired ATPase activity do not support Golgi transport in vitro(10Whiteheart S.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20636-20641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether disassembly of the SNARE complex by NSF leads directly to membrane fusion, or serves as a priming step for a subsequent, perhaps Ca2+ stimulated reaction that causes membrane fusion is unknown. Furthermore, exactly how the SNAPs and NSF interact with the individual components of the SNARE complex remains an open question. We have now studied the interactions between α-SNAP, NSF, and purified individual synaptic SNARE proteins (syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin). We find that syntaxin binds with moderate affinity to α-SNAP and that the syntaxin-α-SNAP complex is a target for NSF action. NSF uses the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to induce a conformational change through α-SNAP in syntaxin. This reaction leads to the previously described disassembly of the synaptic fusion complex. Plasmids encoding His6-α-SNAP, untagged β-SNAP(6Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T.

Full-length and truncated coding sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotides containing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into the indicated plasmid(33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two vector systems were used to generate fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Expression in the vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol.) generates fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Expression in the pTrcHis vector (InVitrogen, Portland, OR) generates fusion proteins in which a 6-histidine tag and a 32-45-amino-acid linker sequence are fused to the amino terminus. Full-length α- and β-SNAP and two fragments of α-SNAP (residues 1-154 and 114-295) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction and were subcloned into pGEX-2T. Primers used for amplification included: α-SNAP full-length: (sense, EcoRI) 5′-TATAGGATCCATGGACAACTCCGGGAAG-3′ (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-ATAGAATTCTTAGCGCAGGTCTTCCTC-3′; α-SNAP(1-154): (sense, EcoRI) 5′-TATAGGATCCATGGACAACTCCGGGAAG-3′ (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-GCAGAATTCGCCTTTGTAGTAGTCTGC-3′; α-SNAP(114-295): (sense, EcoRI) 5′-CGTGAATTCGTATGGGCCGCTTCACCATC-3′ (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-ATAGAATTCTTAGCGCAGGTCTTCCTC-3′; β-SNAP: (sense, BamHI) 5′-GCGGATCCATGGACAACGCG-3′ (antisense, BamHI) 5′-GCGGATCCTCACTTGAGGTCTCCGTC-3′. Full-length syntaxin 1A in pGEX-2T and pTrcHis has been previously described(34Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1A fragments (residues 1-193 and 194-288) were introduced into pGEX-2T after amplification with the following primers: syntaxin(1-193): (sense, EcoRI) 5′-TATGAATTCTTATGAAGGACCGAACCCAG-3′ (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-GCGAATTCCTAACTGAGGGCCTGCTTCGA-3′; syntaxin(194-288): (sense, EcoRI) 5′-CGTGAATTCGGATGGAGATCGAGACCAGGCAC-3′ (antisense, EcoRI) 5′-ATA-GAATTCCTATCCAAAGATGCCCCCG-3′. SNAP-25B in pTrcHisA has been previously described (35Walch-Solimena C. Blasi J. Edelmann L. Chapman E.R. Fischer von Mollard G. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) as has synaptobrevin II in pGEX-2T(36Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Synaptobrevin II was also introduced into pTrcHisA as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment. GST fusion proteins were purified essentially as described (34Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) except that HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol) was used as the primary buffer. In the purification of proteins retaining their transmembrane domains (full-length syntaxin, synaptobrevin; syntaxin(194-288)) 0.5% Triton X-100 was added to all washing buffers. Synaptobrevin II was separated from GST by treating the glutathione-Sepharose-immobilized fusion protein with 1 unit of thrombin (Sigma) per 500 μl of beads in HBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h(37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Thrombin was then inhibited by addition of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the supernatant containing released synaptobrevin was collected. Fusion proteins expressed in pTrcHis were also purified essentially as described previously(34Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted in steps from Ni2+-Sepharose (ProBond, InVitrogen) with buffer containing 80 mM, 160 mM, or 400 mM imidazole, pH 7.6. In a typical purification from 1 liter of bacteria, 0.8 ml of resin was used and eluted with two 1-ml fractions at each imidazole concentration. Fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue and then dialyzed against HBS and, when appropriate, 0.5% Triton X-100. Syntaxin 1A(1-288) was most concentrated in fractions eluted with 400 mM imidazole, and a typical preparation from 1 liter of bacteria produced 0.5 mg of essentially pure syntaxin. SNAP-25 was most concentrated in fractions eluted with 160 mM imidazole, and a typical preparation from 1 liter of bacteria produced 100 μg of SNAP-25 which was 50-75% pure. Synaptobrevin II was also most concentrated in fractions eluted with 160 mM imidazole, and a typical preparation from 1 liter of bacteria produced 200 μg of synaptobrevin which was 50-75% pure. His6-NSF and His6-α-SNAP (expressed in the pQE9 vector (Qiagen)) were purified essentially according to published procedures(6Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 38Wilson D.W. Rothman J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). His6-NSF was eluted from Ni2+-Sepharose with a continuous gradient of imidazole (0-500 mM in 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots were snap frozen and stored at −70°C. His6-α-SNAP was eluted from Ni2+-Sepharose with steps of 80 mM, 160 mM, and 400 mM imidazole as above. A typical preparation of α-SNAP from 1 liter of bacteria produced >10 mg of essentially pure protein. New monoclonal antibodies recognizing α- and β-SNAP were generated (Fig. 1). Purified α-SNAP (cleaved with thrombin from a GST-α-SNAP fusion protein) was used to immunize BALB/c mice. Two hybridoma cell lines (clones Cl 77.1 and 77.2) were established using standard procedures for fusion, propagation, and screening(39Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12737) Google Scholar, 40Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4137-4141Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit serum recognizing NSF (R32) was generated using purified His6-NSF by standard procedures(41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated together at the concentrations indicated in a final volume of 100 μl at 4°C with gentle agitation. Standard binding assay buffer included 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After 4 h, samples were briefly spun to remove any aggregated material (5 min, 12,000 revolutions/min in 4°C microfuge). After transfer to a fresh tube, 5 μl of ascites fluid (containing 5-15 μg of specific IgG) was added, and incubations were continued for 1 h. 25 μl of a 70% protein G-Sepharose suspension was then added, and samples were incubated for an additional 1 h. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation (30 s, 3000 revolutions/min in microfuge), and then washed three times with 1 ml of buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were finally solubilized with 40 μl of 1.5 × SDS sample buffer (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and heated for 5 min. The monoclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitation included HPC-1 for syntaxin(43Barnstable C.J. Hofstein R. Akagawa K. Dev. Brain Res. 1985; 20: 286-290Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Cl 69.1 for synaptobrevin(36Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and Cl 71.2 for SNAP-25 (35). Soluble proteins were incubated together with the indicated amount of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in standard binding buffer. Incubations were for 4 h, after which the beads were washed and processed as described for protein G-Sepharose beads above. Syntaxin was incubated together with α-SNAP and, where indicated, synaptobrevin for 2 h in a prebinding reaction. The buffer used was the same as in the binding reactions above, but also contained 2 mM MgCl2. Disassembly reactions were initiated by addition of NSF (2-5 μg/100 μl reaction) together with ATP or ATPγS (1 mM each), and allowed to proceed for 1 h. When immobilized GST-syntaxin was used in the disassembly reaction, the beads were washed directly after the reaction, and bound proteins were solublized in 1.5 × SDS sample buffer as above. When His6-syntaxin was used in the disassembly reaction, it was collected by immunoprecipitation with HPC-1 and protein G-Sepharose beads, as described above. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described(34Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (ascites fluid) or polyclonal sera diluted 1:1000-1:2000 in Blotto (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5% powdered non-fat milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4°C. Blots to be probed with 125I-protein A were washed and incubated with secondary rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cappel), washed again and then incubated with 0.1 μCi/ml 125I-protein A (DuPont NEN) for 1-2 h, and finally washed five to six times over >2 h. After drying, membranes were exposed to x-ray film. For quantitation, radioactive membranes were exposed to Phosphor-screens which were analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant software. When alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were used, immunoreactive bands were visualized by addition of nitro blue tetrazolium (0.33 mg/ml) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.17 mg/ml). Densitometry (used for relative quantitation of Coomassie-stained bands) was performed using a Visage 2000 Scanner (BioImage Products, MilliGen/Biosearch Division of Millipore, Ann Arbor, MI). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) or estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels of recombinant proteins. To study the interaction of α-SNAP with its receptors, we raised monoclonal antibodies directed against recombinant α-SNAP. Two hybridoma cell lines were developed and are designated Cl 77.1 and Cl 77.2. As shown in Fig. 1A, each recognized two proteins in a rat brain homogenate with apparent molecular masses of 33 and 34 kDa. Based on the high similarity between α-SNAP and β-SNAP (83% identity(6Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)), it is likely that this doublet consists of α- and β-SNAP. Using recombinant GST fusion proteins encoding α-SNAP and β-SNAP, we confirmed this specificity (Fig. 1B). Both antibodies recognize α- and β-SNAP, and neither antibody recognizes GST alone. In the first series of experiments, we asked whether α-SNAP can bind to the individual SNARE proteins syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin. For this purpose we expressed full-length syntaxin 1A (referred to henceforth as syntaxin), synaptobrevin II (referred to as synaptobrevin), SNAP-25, and α-SNAP each in bacteria fused to either a 6-histidine (His6) or GST tag. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography (using Ni2+- or glutathione-Sepharose) and when indicated separated from the GST moiety by thrombin cleavage. To assay for binding, each SNARE protein was incubated separately with increasing concentrations of α-SNAP. The SNARE proteins were then collected by immunoprecipitation using specific monoclonal antibodies and analyzed for bound α-SNAP by immunoblotting. When syntaxin was used in the assay, α-SNAP bound efficiently (Fig. 2A), with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of between 500 nM and 1 μM. At saturation, about 1 mol of α-SNAP was bound for every 3-4 mol of syntaxin collected, as judged by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained samples (see, for example, Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation of α-SNAP by the syntaxin-specific antibody HPC-1 was dependent on the presence of syntaxin, as essentially no α-SNAP was detected in control precipitations lacking syntaxin (not shown, but see Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that under these conditions α-SNAP did not adsorb significantly to the plastic surface of the test tubes, as has been described when higher concentrations of α-SNAP are used (5, 13, 45). We also tested the effect of increasing concentrations of sodium chloride on the binding of α-SNAP to syntaxin (Fig. 2B). The interaction between these proteins was unaffected by 500 mM sodium chloride and was reduced by higher sodium chloride concentrations. α-SNAP binding to syntaxin is thus relatively salt resistant, as is the binding of synaptobrevin and SNAP-25 to syntaxin(46Hayashi T.

We have generated a new recombinant chimeric toxin composed of human interleukin 13 (hIL13) and a Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) mutant, PE38QQR. The hIL13-PE38QQR chimera is highly cytotoxic to cell lines derived from several human epithelial carcinomas such as adenocarcinoma of stomach, colon, and skin. The cytotoxic action of hIL13-PE38QQR, which can only occur upon internalization of ligand-receptor complex, is blocked by an excess of hIL13 but not of hIL2. This action is not solely hIL13-specific because an excess of hIL4 also blocks the cytotoxicity of hIL13-toxin. Conversely, hIL13 blocks the cytotoxicity of a hIL4-PE38QQR chimera. Binding studies showed that hIL13 displaces competitively 125I-labeled hIL4-PE38QQR on carcinoma cells. These results indicate that IL4 and IL13 compete for a common binding site on the studied human cell lines. Despite this competition, hIL4 but not hIL13 decreased protein synthesis in malignant cells susceptible to the cytotoxicity of both hIL13- and hIL4-PE38QQR.

IL13 is a potentially glycosylated peptide of Mr 12,000, and it bears a limited but significant homology to IL4 at the N and C termini of the protein chain. Both ends of IL4 are important for binding to receptor (3, 4). Functional responses of normal blood cells to IL13 are pleiotropic and often, but not always, overlapping with those observed using IL4(5Jacobsen S.E.W. Okkenhaug C. Veiby O.P. Caput D. Ferrara P.

It has been suggested that receptors for hIL4 and hIL13 share a subunit that is important for ligand-induced intracellular signaling(7Zurawski S.M. Bega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This is based on observation that an antagonist of IL4, a mutated form of hIL4, blocked the mitogenic effect of both hIL4 and hIL13 on pre-leukemic TF 1 cells. As hIL13 weakly displaced labeled hIL4 from binding sites, nonmutated hIL4 competition for hIL13 sites was not reported(7Zurawski S.M. Bega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In fact, our experiments showed lack of displacement of labeled hIL13 by a wild-type hIL4 on TF 1 cells and a very weak or nil displacement of hIL13 by hIL4 on two renal cell carcinoma cell lines(8Obiri N.I.

We have also shown that the PE-containing chimeric toxins have prominent antitumor activities in a human solid tumor xenograft model(15Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).PE is a single-chain bacterial protein made up of three major domains (for review, see Ref. 16). A characteristic feature of PE is that the N-terminally located domain Ia binds to the α2-macroglobulin receptor, and the ligand-receptor complex undergoes receptor-mediated internalization (endocytosis) to allow intracellular routing and processing of the toxin(16Pastan I. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Domain II is a site of proteolytic cleavage that activates PE and is necessary to catalyze the translocation of the toxin into the cytosol. The C-terminal domain, domain III, contains the REDLK sequence that directs the processed fragment of the toxin to the endoplasmic recticulum and possesses an ADP ribosylation activity that inactivates elongation factor 2 and leads to cell death(16Pastan I. Chaudhary V.K. FitzGerald D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Since domain Ia of PE binds to many types of eukaryotic cells, several mutated forms of the exotoxin have been constructed that do not bind to its ubiquitous receptor and can be attached at a gene level to various internalized ligands. One of the derivatives of PE used in the present study is PE38QQR in which domain Ia (amino acids 1-252) and amino acids 365-380 of PE are deleted, and lysine residues at positions 590 and 606 are replaced by glutamine and at 613 replaced by arginine(17Debinski W. Pastan I. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Because hIL4R are richly represented among malignancies and because of the similarities between hIL4 and hIL13, we used human cancer cell lines to study the interaction of hIL13 and hIL4 with their receptors. We have used a novel recombinant chimeric toxin in which hIL13 is fused to PE38QQR, since fusion proteins containing PE are a powerful mean of plasma membrane receptors analysis(18Waldmann T.A. Pastan I.H. Gansow O.A. Junghans R.P. Ann. Int. Med. 1992; 116: 148-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction endonucleases and DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Life Technologies, Inc., and Boehringer Mannheim. [3H]Leucine and 125I were purchased from Amersham Corp. Fast protein liquid chromatography columns and media were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized at Pharmacia's Gene Assembler at the Research Center, Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Montreal. PCR kit was from Perkin-Elmer.Plasmids, Bacterial Strains, and Cell LinesPlasmids carry a T7 bacteriophage late promoter, a T7 transcription terminator at the end of the open reading frame of the protein, a f1 origin of replication and gene for ampicillin resistance(19Debinski W. Karlsson B. Lindholm L. Siegall C.B. Willingham M.C. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The gene encoding hIL13 (a generous gift of Dr. René de Waal Malefyt of the DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA to W.D.; plasmid JFE14-SRα) was PCR-cloned into plasmid pWDMH-QQR to produce hIL13-PE38QQR or into plasmid pSGC242FdN1(20Debinski W. Pastan I. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), to make hIL13 alone. hIL4 was cloned into an expression vector in a similar way to hIL13 using plasmid pWDMH4 (12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template for PCR amplification. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (λDE3) under control of the T7 late promoter(12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were amplified in E. coli (HB101 or DH5α high efficiency transformation) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNA was extracted using Qiagen kits (Chatsworth, CA).Plamids ConstructionThe chimeric gene encoding hIL13-PE38QQR (phuIL13-Tx) was constructed as outlined (see Fig. 1). hIL13 was PCR-amplified from plasmid JFE14-SRα in its mature form. New sites were introduced for the restriction endonucleases NdeI and HindIII at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the hIL13 gene, respectively. The 336-base pair DNA fragment was obtained during 25 cycles of PCR and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. The digested fragment was subcloned into the vector obtained by digestion of plasmid pWDMH4-QQR (15Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with NdeI and HindIII to produce plasmid phuIL13-Tx. The 5′ end of the gene fusion was sequenced and showed the correct DNA of hIL13.Expression and Purification of Recombinant ProteinsE. coli BL21 (λDE3) cells were transformed with plasmids of interest and cultured in 1.0 liter of Terrific Broth (Life Technologies, Inc.). hIL13 and hIL13-PE38QQR were localized to the inclusion bodies. The procedure for the recombinant proteins isolation from the inclusion bodies was described previously(12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis, the renatured protein of hIL13-PE38QQR was purified on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow and by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia). The initial step of hIL13 or hIL4 purification was conducted on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia).Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Pierce “Plus,” Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Protein Synthesis Inhibition AssayThe cytotoxic activity of chimeric toxins, such as hIL13-PE38QQR, were tested as follows. Usually 1 × 104 cells/well were plated in a 24-well tissue culture plate in 1 ml of medium, and various concentrations of the chimeric toxins were added 20-28 h following cell plating. After 20 h of incubation with chimeric toxins, [3H]leucine was added to cells for 4 h, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured. For blocking studies, rhIL2, −4, or −13 was added to cells for 30 min before the chimeric toxin addition. Data were obtained from the average of duplicates, and the assays were repeated several times.To evaluate the effects of cytokines on the protein synthesis, the assays were performed as follows. 2 × 103 cells/well were plated in a 24-well tissue culture plate in 1 ml of medium, and the cytokines were added 20 h following cell plating. After 72 h of incubation with the cytokines, [3H]leucine was added to the cells for 4 h, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured.Competitive Binding AssayWe determined the binding ability of hIL13 as compared with hIL4-PE38QQR. The recombinant hIL4-PE38QQR was labeled with 125I using the lactoperoxidase method exactly as described previously(19Debinski W. Karlsson B. Lindholm L. Siegall C.B. Willingham M.C. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-hIL4-PE38QQR was 6.2 μCi/μg of protein. Binding assays were performed by a standard saturation and displacement curves analysis. A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture plates at 24 h before the experiment. The plates were placed on ice, and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ in 0.2% bovine serum albumin, as described previously(19Debinski W. Karlsson B. Lindholm L. Siegall C.B. Willingham M.C. FitzGerald D. Pastan I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Then, increasing concentrations of hIL13 or hIL4-PE38QQR were added to cells and incubated 30 min prior to the addition of fixed amount of 125I-hIL4-PE38QQR for 2-3 h. After incubation, the cells were washed twice and lysed with 0.1 NAOH, and the radioactivity was counted in a γ counter.RESULTSTo construct the chimeric toxin, the coding region of the hIL13 gene was fused to a gene encoding a mutated form of PE, PE38QQR (Figs. 1 and 2A). The chimeric gene is in the bacterial vector under the control of a bacteriophage T7 late promoter; the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (λDE3) as described previously (12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). hIL13 alone was subcloned into the same expression plasmid. hIL13 and hIL13-PE38QQR were expressed at high levels in bacteria as seen in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the total cell extract (Fig. 2B). After initial purification on SP-Sepharose (hIL13) or Q-Sepharose (hIL13-PE38QQR), the renatured recombinant proteins were applied onto a Sephacryl S-200 HR Pharmacia column (Fig. 2B). hIL13 and hIL13-PE38QQR appeared as single entities demonstrating the very high purity of the final products. The chimeric toxin migrated within somewhat lower than expected for 50-kDa protein Mr range, which may be related to the hydrophobicity of the molecule. The biologic activity of the rhIL13 was exactly the same as one obtained from Sanofi Elf Bio Recherche(8Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

Therefore, we tested several established cancer cell lines to determine if hIL13-PE38QQR is cytotoxic to them. We examined cancers derived from colon, skin, and stomach; the cancer cells were sensitive to hIL13-PE38QQR with IC50 values ranging from less than 1 ng/ml to 300 ng/ml (20 pM to 6.0 nM). A colon adenocarcinoma cell line, Colo201, was very responsive with an IC50 of 1 ng/ml (Fig. 3). A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells were also very sensitive to the action of hIL13-toxin; the IC50 for hIL13-PE38QQR ranged from 6 to 10 ng/ml. A gastric carcinoma CRL1739 cell line responded moderately to the hIL13-toxin with an IC50 of 50 ng/ml. Another colon carcinoma cell line, Colo205, had a poorer response with an IC50 of 300 ng/ml. The cytotoxic action of hIL13-PE38QQR was specific as it was blocked by a 10-fold excess of hIL13 on all cells (Fig. 3). These data suggest that a specturm of human cancer cells possess hIL13 binding sites and such cells are sensitive to hIL13-PE38QQR chimeric toxin.Figure 3:Cytotoxic activity of hIL13-PE38QQR on several cancer cell lines and an inhibition of this cytotoxicity by hIL13. hIL13 was added at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml.

The cells were treated with hIL13-PE38QQR with or without rhIL2 (a gift from Cetus) at a concentration of 1.0 or 10 μg/ml. The rhIL2 did not have any blocking action on hIL13-PE38QQR on the two cell lines, even at 10,000-fold molar excess over the chimeric toxin (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the cell killing by the hIL13-toxin is independent of the presence of hIL2.Figure 4:Failure to block the cytotoxicity of hIL13-PE38QQR on cancer cells by 1.0 μg/ml or 10 μg/ml of hIL2.

Unexpectedly, we found that hIL4 inhibited very potently the cytotoxic activity of the hIL13-toxin. This phenomenon was seen on all of the tested cell lines, which includes Colo201, A431 (Fig. 5), and CRL1739.2 2W. Debinski, unpublished data. To investigate the possibility that hIL13 and hIL4 may compete for the same binding site, we also treated the cells with hIL4-based recombinant toxin, hIL4-PE38QQR (15Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE38QQR had already been shown to be blocked by an excess of hIL4 but not of hIL2(15Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present experiment, we examined hIL13 and found that it blocked potently the cytotoxic activity of hIL4-PE38QQR (Fig. 5). Also, the action of another hIL4-based chimeric toxin, hIL4-PE4E(12Debinski W. Puri R.K. Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14065-14070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was blocked by an excess of hIL13 on Colo201 and A431 cells.2 Thus, the cytotoxicity of hIL13-PE38QQR is blocked by an excess of hIL13 or hIL4, and the cytotoxic action of hIL4-PE38QQR is also blocked by the same two growth factors. However, IL2 does not block the action of either chimeric toxin. These results strongly suggest that hIL4 and hIL13 have affinities for the same binding site.Figure 5:Blocking the cytotoxicity of hIL13-PE38QQR by hIL4 and blocking the cytotoxicity of hIL4-PE38QQR by hIL13 on cancer cell lines. hIL4 was added at a concentration of 0.25 μg/ml and hIL13 at a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml.

Fig. 6 illustrates experiments in which we used both hIL13- and hIL4-PE38QQR at equimolar concentrations on A431 cells. When the cells were incubated with both chimeric toxins concomitantly, the cytotoxic action was preserved, and additive effect was observed as expected.2 An excess of hIL13 efficiently blocked the action of a mixture of the two chimeric toxins (Fig. 6). Moreover, neither hIL13 (Fig. 6) nor hIL42 blocked the cell killing by another mixture composed of hIL13-PE38QQR and TGFα-PE40, a chimeric toxin that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (TGFα-based chimeric toxin, TGFα-PE40)(21Siegall C.B.

To investigate this, we performed competitive binding assays. The iodination of hIL4-PE38QQR and the binding experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” hIL4-PE38QQR competed for the binding of 125I-hIL4-PE38QQR to A431 cells with an apparent IC50 of 4 × 10-8M (Fig. 7). In addition, hIL13 also competed for the 125I-hIL4-PE38QQR binding site with a comparable potency to that exhibited by the chimeric protein. More extensive binding studies have shown that hIL13 competes for hIL4 binding sites on human renal carcinoma cell lines also(8Obiri N.I. Debinski W. Leonard W.J. Puri R.K. J. Biol.

We observed the expected potent cytotoxic actions of these recombinant toxins and neither hIL13 nor hIL4 blocked these actions on A431 and Colo205 cells.2hIL4 and hIL13 Compete for a Common Binding Site on Carcinoma Cells but May Evoke Different Biological EffectsDespite being competitors for the same binding site, some differences were observed in hIL13- and hIL4-induced cellular effects. Protein synthesis was inhibited in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells in a dose-dependent manner by hIL4 alone (Fig. 8) or by a ADP ribosylation-deficient chimeric toxin containing hIL4(15Debinski W. Puri R.K. Pastan I. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This effect of hIL4 or enzymatically deficient chimeric toxin can be best seen with a prolonged time of incubation (≥24 h) and requires concentrations of hIL4 many fold higher than that of the active chimeric toxin in order to cause a substantial decrease in tritium incorporation. When, however, A431 cells were treated with various concentrations of hIL13, no inhibition (or stimulation) of protein synthesis was observed, even at concentrations as high as 10 μg/ml of hIL13 for a 72-h incubation (Fig. 8). The same lack of response to hIL13 was found on renal cell carcinoma cells PM-RCC.3 3R. K. Puri, unpublished data. Thus, hIL13 and hIL4 possess a common site but may transduce differently in carcinoma cells expressing this common site, such as A431 and PM-RCC cells.Figure 8:hIL4, but not hIL13, inhibits protein synthesis in A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells.

Nature has devised a strategy for handling neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, in the extracellular aqueous environment by packaging them into lipoproteins for delivery to tissues via the blood. These well characterized conveyances have an outer monolayer of polar lipids and proteins that serve specific roles in nucleation of lipoprotein formation, targeting of lipoproteins to specific cell surface receptors, and metabolism of the component lipids (1, 2). While much is known about the structure and metabolism of lipoproteins, little is known about the composition of two metabolically important intracellular lipid pools: the triacylglycerol-rich droplets in adipocytes that contain the vast majority of bodily energy reserves and the cholesteryl ester-containing droplets in steroidogenic cells that contain the precursors for steroid hormone synthesis. Recently, we identified unique proteins, termed perilipins, located exclusively at the surface of intracellular lipid droplets of adipocytes(3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B.

Based on their subcellular location and metabolic properties, i.e. polyphosphorylation in concert with lipolytic stimulation of adipocytes, we have suggested that perilipins play a role, as yet undefined, in lipid metabolism. Although initial Western and Northern blot analyses failed to reveal perilipins in non-adipose tissues(3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol.

Given these similarities in lipid metabolism, one might expect to find perilipins associated with the lipid droplets in steroidogenic cells. In the present paper, we report the occurrence of lipid droplet-associated perilipins in both adrenal cortical and Leydig cells, including one major species, perilipin C, that is relatively abundant in these steroid producing cells but is not detectable by Western blotting of adipocyte proteins. 3T3-L1 adipocyte, Y-1 adrenal cortical cells, and MA-10 Leydig cells, all murine cell lines, were cultured in 100-mm plates. 3T3-L1 adipoblasts were grown to confluence and differentiated into adipocytes for 14 days(8Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The adipocytes were prepared for Western blot analysis by lysing the cells for 15 min in 3 ml of a lysing medium containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 100 μM [4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride] hydrochloride. Lysed cells were disrupted with 10 strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. Y-1 adrenal cortical cells (9Buonassisi V. Sato G. Cohen A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1184-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) were grown to confluence in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) medium containing 10% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and maintained in a 37°C incubator with a 3.2% CO2 atmosphere. MA-10 Leydig cells (10Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) were grown to confluence in Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 15% horse serum, 1 mM glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and maintained in a 37°C incubator with a 3.2% CO2 atmosphere. To prepare both Y-1 adrenal cortical and MA-10 Leydig cells for Western blot analysis, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plates in 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 × g at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were hypotonically lysed for 15 min in the lysing medium described above and disrupted by 10 strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer; homogenates were centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The floating cholesteryl ester droplets were removed in as little volume as possible, recentrifuged, and the supernatant under the droplets was removed by aspiration with a fine needle. Successive centrifugations were employed to separate the lipid droplets from the supernatant. Homogenates of adipocytes and purified cholesteryl ester droplets from the steroidogenic cells were extracted for 30 min at 37°C with 2.5% SDS, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, the protease inhibitors as above, and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the infranatant under the undissolved lipid was removed and applied to SDS-PAGE1 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisACTHadrenocorticotropic hormonePKAcAMP-dependent protein kinasekbkilobase. gels (10% acrylamide and 0.2% N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide) in Laemmli sample buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis adrenocorticotropic hormone cAMP-dependent protein kinase kilobase. Polyclonal antibodies with specific reactivity against the unique carboxyl terminus of perilipin A were affinity-purified from rabbit antisera raised against full-length rat perilipin A. The carboxyl-terminal peptide from perilipin A (amino acids 421-517) was produced as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli using the QIAexpress system (QIAGEN, Inc). An affinity column was prepared by coupling the purified peptide to Affi-Gel® 10 resin (Bio-Rad). Antibodies were purified by repetitive applications of rabbit antisera raised against full-length rat perilipin A over the affinity column using a Pharmacia FPLC system. Antibodies with specific reactivity against full-length perilipin A were isolated from rabbit antisera raised against perilipin A purified from fat cakes of primary rat adipocytes, as described previously(3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat and murine primary adipocytes, and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Y-1 adrenal cortical cells, and MA-10 Leydig cells by the TRIzol method (Life Technologies, Inc.). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels; the RNA was then transferred to nitrocellulose. High stringency Northern blot analysis using a radioactively labeled full-length perilipin A cDNA probe was performed as described previously(4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The major form of perilipin expressed in primary rat and murine adipocytes, and in cultured murine 3T3-L1 adipocytes, is perilipin A, predicted to be ∼57 kDa, but which migrates on SDS-PAGE gels as a ∼61 kDa protein(3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).2 2With minor exceptions, as noted in the present paper, the perilipin proteins found in murine adipocytes are nearly identical to those in rat adipocytes (T. Takeda, C. M. Rondinone, J. L. Theodorakis, T. Barber, E. J. Blanchette-Mackie, R. H. Pointer, A. R. Kimmel, A. S. Greenberg, and C. Londos, submitted for publication). Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies affinity-purified against full-length perilipin A revealed that Y-1 adrenal cortical cells and MA-10 Leydig cells contain a protein that co-migrates on SDS-PAGE with perilipin A from cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A). A second major protein of ∼42 kDa was readily detected by the perilipin-specific antibodies in both steroidogenic cell lines, but not in adipocytes. It is unlikely that the 42-kDa species is a proteolytic breakdown product of perilipin A, since the relative amounts of perilipin A and the 42-kDa protein remain constant whether the cells are lysed immediately in a medium containing SDS and protease inhibitors or are homogenized and subcellular fractions are prepared. We designate the 42-kDa protein as perilipin C (see below). There were clear quantitative differences in the amounts of perilipins A and C in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells. When normalized for DNA in cell homogenates, the amount of perilipin A in isolated lipid droplets (see below) from adipocyte homogenates was at least 20-30-fold greater than that in isolated lipid droplets from the steroid producing cells. 3T. Barber, E. J. Blanchette-Mackie, J. Wolff, and C. Londos, unpublished data. Furthermore, prolonged overexposure of these immunoblots that were probed with 125I-protein A failed to reveal perilipin C in adipocytes (data not shown). As with adipocytes(3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the perilipins in the steroidogenic cells fractionated primarily with the floating lipid droplets upon centrifugation of homogenates (Fig. 1B); the minor amounts of perilipins A and C in supernatant and membrane fractions from Y-1 adrenal cortical cells probably represent contamination of these fractions with lipid droplets.3 Identical results were obtained upon fractionation of MA-10 Leydig cells (data not shown). In the overexposed Western blot of the lipid fraction of the Y-1 adrenal cells (Fig. 1B), two additional proteins were detected at ∼46 and ∼47 kDa; the smaller protein may represent perilipin B, a minor 46-kDa species observed in rat and murine adipocytes (4).2 The larger form, tentatively designated as perilipin D, may correspond to the 1.8-kb mRNA expressed in both steroidogenic cells and adipocytes (see below). Thus, perilipin A is the major species expressed in both adipocytes and steroidogenic cells; additionally, adrenal cortical and Leydig cells contain relatively abundant amounts of perilipin C, which is not detected in adipocytes by Western blotting. The two species of perilipin, A and B, for which sequence data are available arise by alternative splicing of RNA; A and B are identical through their 406 NH2-terminal amino acids, but contain dissimilar COOH termini(4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To obtain information on the composition of perilipin C, antibodies specific for the COOH terminus of perilipin A were affinity-purified with the use of a polypeptide containing the unique region of perilipin A (Fig. 1C). These antibodies recognized perilipin A in adipocytes as well as the corresponding protein in the adrenal cells. On the other hand, the perilipin A, carboxyl-terminal-specific antibodies did not detect a signal at ∼42 kDa, suggesting that perilipin C lacks this COOH-terminal sequence. With affinity-purified antibodies directed against full-length perilipin A, we found that the relative amounts of perilipins A and C differed among different isolates of Y-1 adrenal cells. However, since we have determined that many of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies are found in the unique COOH terminus of perilipin A,4 4Antisera raised against perilipin that was purified from rat fat cakes have strong reactivity against a recombinant peptide containing the COOH-terminal 97 amino acids of perilipin A. These antisera have weak reactivity against recombinant peptides containing the NH2-terminal sequence, amino acids 17-121 (D. L. Brasaemle and C. Londos, unpublished data). it was not possible to quantify the relative amounts of perilipins A and C in various cells. Finally, the COOH-terminal-specific antibody preparation also detected a protein of ∼47/48 kDa, which may represent perilipin D, a variant that is expressed weakly in Y-1 cells relative to 3T3-L1 cells (see Figs. 1A and 2). Previously, with a probe containing full-length coding perilipin A cDNA, we detected two perilipin mRNA species in primary rat adipocytes by Northern blot analysis, one of 3.9 kb corresponding to perilipin B and the other of 3.0 kb, which is perilipin A(4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). With the same probe, four mRNA species were detected in the four murine cell lines examined: primary and cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Y-1 adrenal cells, and MA-10 Leydig cells. The relative abundances of the four mRNAs differed among the cell lines (Fig. 2). The 3.0-kb mRNA was the most abundant in all cells, and further studies with selective probes indicated that as in rat, this species encodes perilipin A.5 5Rat and murine perilipin A cDNAs share 93% identity at the amino acid level. Five different ∼400-base pair polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments, corresponding to the entire murine perilipin A coding region, hybridize with the 3.0-kb mRNA (J. Gruia-Gray, unpublished data). The 3T3-L1 and primary adipocytes also contained 3.9- and 1.8-kb mRNAs. A relatively rare 1.5-kb species in adipocytes was detected upon overexposure of the blots (Fig. 2, lane 7). In Y-1 adrenal cortical and MA-10 Leydig cells, the 1.5-kb mRNA was nearly as abundant as that at 3.0 kb; relatively minor amounts of the 3.9- and 1.8-kb species were observed. Clearly, a distinctive feature of the steroidogenic cells is the relative abundance of the 1.5-kb mRNA. This finding parallels the detection of the novel ∼42-kDa protein, suggesting that the 1.5-kb species encodes perilipin C. Finally, the overall abundance of mRNAs for perilipins in the steroidogenic cell lines is considerably less than in adipocytes. Despite loading of 7 times more RNA from adrenal and Leydig cells than from adipocytes onto the gels for Northern blot analyses, the signal for perilipin A was weaker in the steroidogenic cells, indicating that the relative abundance of the perilipin A mRNA in the adrenal and Leydig cells is <5% of that in adipocytes. These data are consistent with previous observations, which predicted that if perilipin mRNAs were present in non-adipose tissues, they would represent less than 0.01% of total mRNA(4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As in rat adipocytes, a substantial fraction of the perilipin A in murine adipocytes is partially phosphorylated in lipolytically quiet cells and migrates in SDS-PAGE gels as a ∼62-kDa protein. Upon lipolytic stimulation by agents that increase cellular cAMP concentrations, perilipin A is polyphosphorylated and migrates as a 65/67 kDa rat protein (3Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a 65-kDa murine protein. Steroidogenesis in Y-1 adrenal cortical cells is induced by ACTH or forskolin, both of which increase cAMP concentrations(11Temple R. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2691-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sackett D. Wolff J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); treatment of cells with either agent altered the migration of perilipin A in SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3). With ACTH, approximately 25% of the perilipin shifted upward to 65 kDa, whereas with forskolin ∼75% of the protein exhibited altered migration, thus indicating greater activation of PKA by forskolin. Colchicine, which stimulates steroidogenesis in these cells in a non-cAMP-dependent fashion(12Sackett D. Wolff J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 888: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), produced no change in perilipin A behavior in SDS-PAGE. By contrast, none of the agents produced a change in the migration of perilipin C, which is not surprising since the PKA sites responsible for shifting the position of perilipin A under SDS-PAGE are in the COOH terminus(4Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90 (1993): 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the region apparently absent from perilipin C, as noted above. Perilipins are not universal components of intracellular lipid deposits. For example, we have failed to detect perilipins in hepatocytes, in Ito cells of liver, and in alveolar cells of mammary glands from lactating rats, all of which contain prominent triacylglycerol deposits. 6Blanchette-Mackie, E. J., Dwyer, N. K., Barber, T., Coxey, R. A., Takeda, T., Rondinone, C. M., Theodorakis, J. L., Greenberg, A. S., and Londos, C., J. Lipid Res. (1995) 36, in press. 6 Similarly, no perilipin was detected in cholesterol-loaded J-774 macrophages, a model for foam cells, or in lipid-laden fibroblasts from subjects with the neutral lipid storage disease, ichthyosis. 7A. S. Greenberg, personal communication. Thus, we consider the occurrence of perilipins in steroidogenic cells to be significant, and most likely related to the similar modes by which the cholesteryl esters of these cells and the triacylglycerols of adipocytes are hydrolyzed. As in adipocytes, the major species expressed in the steroidogenic cells is perilipin A, identified by co-migration in SDS-PAGE gels with adipocyte perilipin A, by recognition of the protein by antibodies directed against the unique COOH-terminal segment of perilipin A, and by altered migration on SDS-PAGE upon phosphorylation by PKA, corresponding to the migration of adipocyte perilipin A in its PKA-phosphorylated form. The occurrence of relatively abundant amounts of perilipin C in steroidogenic cells is in contrast to adipocytes, where expression of perilipin C mRNA is minimal and no perilipin C protein is detected. One factor that makes this finding especially intriguing is the absence in perilipin C of the COOH-terminal segment of perilipin A, which contains three of the six consensus PKA sites (4). Thus, if phosphorylation of perilipin by PKA is required for or facilitates lipid hydrolysis, perilipin C may protect against lipid metabolism and thus provide a mechanism for fine tuning of steroid hormone production. The question of similarity or identity between cholesteryl esterase and hormone-sensitive lipase is also unresolved. In accord with the findings of Holm et al.(13Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we find that affinity-purified antibodies against the adipocyte lipase recognize an ∼85-kDa major and an ∼87-kDa minor species in adipocytes, but only the larger species was found in the two steroid producing cells lines (data not shown). Such data suggest that the two hydrolases may differ, and raise the possibility of a distinct metabolic link between the 87-kDa esterase and perilipin C. In this regard, it will be of interest to determine the steroidogenic capacity of cells containing different ratios of the different species of perilipin. Finally, if perilipin serves a functional role in the hydrolysis of lipids by the hormone-sensitive lipase/cholesteryl esterase class of enzymes, one would expect to find abnormal energy metabolism or steroid hormone production under conditions of altered perilipin expression.

Through functional complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in glycine betaine uptake with a gene library from B. subtilis, we have identified a multicomponent glycine betaine transport system, OpuA. Uptake of radiolabeled glycine betaine in B. subtilis was found to be osmotically stimulated and was strongly decreased in a mutant strain lacking the OpuA transport system. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the components of the OpuA system are encoded by an operon (opuA) comprising three structural genes: opuAA, opuAB, and opuAC. The products of these genes exhibit features characteristic for binding protein-dependent transport systems and in particular show homology to the glycine betaine uptake system ProU from E. coli. Expression of the opuA operon is under osmotic control. The transcriptional initiation sites of opuA were mapped by high resolution primer extension analysis, and two opuA mRNAs were detected that differed by 38 base pairs at their 5′ ends. Synthesis of the shorter transcript was strongly increased in cells grown at high osmolarity, whereas the amount of the longer transcript did not vary in response to medium osmolarity. Physical and genetic mapping experiments allowed the positioning the opuA operon at 25° on the genetic map of B. subtilis.

Monitoring and adapting to changes in environmental conditions are critical processes that determine the survival of microorganisms and their successful long term competition for a given habitat. In its soil environment, Bacillus subtilis encounters often osmotic challenges due to frequent variations in the availability of water. Since the cell envelope is permeable to water, drying and wetting of the soil alters the osmotic conditions and hence triggers the flux of water across the cell membrane. Active and timely adaptation reactions are thus required to avoid cell lysis under low osmolarity or dehydration of the cytoplasm under high osmolarity growth conditions (1, 2). Despite the importance of changes in the environmental osmolarity for growth and survival of B. subtilis, the specific physiological and genetic adaptation mechanisms to such environmental challenges are in general rather poorly understood. The exposure of B. subtilis to a hypersaline environment triggers the induction of a set of general and salt-specific stress proteins, indicating that increased salt concentration alerts the cell to adverse growth conditions(3Hecker M. Völker U. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1990; 74: 197-214Crossref Google Scholar). The expression of a number of genes in this general stress regulon is determined by the alternative transcription factor σB, which serves to control a regulatory network responsive to stationary phase signals and growth-limiting conditions(4Benson A.K. Haldenwang W.G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 749-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Völker U. Engelmann S. Maul B. Riethdorf S. Völker A. Schmidt R. Mach H. Hecker M.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, B. subtilis mutant strains lacking the σB protein are not at a survival disadvantage compared with the wild type when exposed to osmotic shock or extreme desiccation under laboratory conditions(6Boylan S.A. Redfield A.R. Brody M.S. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7931-7937Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is uncertain whether members of the σB-controlled general stress regulon play a direct role in the adaptation of B. subtilis to high osmolarity environments. A central part of the physiological response of B. subtilis to high osmolarity stress is the intracellular accumulation of inorganic and organic osmolytes that serve to counterbalance intracellular versus extracellular osmolarity and consequently help to maintain a turgor optimal for cell growth. An increase in medium osmolarity stimulates turgor-sensitive transport systems that mediate rapid accumulation of K+ in the cell, which, in turn, restores turgor and permits cell growth to resume(7Whatmore A.M. Chudek J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Whatmore A.M. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This initial reaction is followed by a cellular response that replaces ionic osmolytes, which are deleterious at high concentrations, with organic osmolytes, which are more compatible with the normal physiological and structural requirements of the bacterial cell(1Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis proline is the predominant organic osmolyte synthesized in defined medium by cells exposed to a hypersaline environment(7Whatmore A.M. Chudek J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, several hours are required to reach a proline level that is sufficient for osmoprotection, leaving the cell at a growth disadvantage in harsh high osmolarity environments(9Boch J. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis can more efficiently respond to high osmolarity by accumulating glycine betaine(9Boch J. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This potent osmoprotectant is widely found in nature and has been adopted across the microbial, plant, and animal kingdoms as an effective compatible solute(1Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Glycine betaine can be synthesized by B. subtilis from its precursor choline or taken up directly from the environment(7Whatmore A.M. Chudek J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen.

Rodriguez-Valera F. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 478-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A strong increase in the growth rate and the proliferation under environmental conditions that are otherwise strongly inhibitory for B. subtilis can be attained when glycine betaine can be directly accumulated from the growth medium(7Whatmore A.M. Chudek J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Boch J. Kempf B. Bremer E. J.

In B. subtilis the importance of exogenously provided glycine betaine for the efficient adaptation to a high osmolarity environment is firmly established, but the route of glycine betaine uptake in this model system for Gram-positive bacteria is unknown. We have begun to characterize the mechanisms of glycine betaine uptake in B. subtilis, and we report in this paper the identification and analysis of a binding protein-dependent transport system (OpuA) for this osmoprotectant. The B. subtilis strain JH642 (trpC2, pheA1; BGSC1 1The abbreviations used are: BGSCBacillus Genetic Stock Centerbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)MMAminimal medium ASMMSpizizen's minimal medium. 1A96), a derivative of the B. subtilis wild-type strain 168, was constructed by J. A. Hoch and was obtained from M. Marahiel. Strain MO1099 (trpC2, pheA1, amyE::ery; BGSC 1A717) has been described(19Gonzy-Tréboul G. Karmazyn-Campelli C. Stragier P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Strain TIBS57 (amyE3, aroI10; BGSC 1A474) was used for the genetic mapping of the opuA operon. The B. subtilis strains BKB4 (Δ(opuA::neo)1]) and BKB7 (Δ(opuA::tet)2) are derivatives of JH642 and were constructed by transforming JH642 with EcoRI restriction fragments isolated from plasmids pBKB11 (Δ(opuA::neo)1; Fig. 1), and pBKB52 (Δ(opuA::tet)2; Fig. 1), respectively, and selecting for kanamycin-resistant (BKB4) or tetracycline-resistant (BKB7) colonies on LB agar plates. The E. coli K-12 strain MKH13 (Δ(putPA) 101 Δ(proP)2Δ(proU) 608) is a derivative of strain MC4100 (20Casadaban M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) and is entirely deficient in glycine betaine uptake(21Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The E. coli B strain BL21(λDE3) was employed for the selective expression of genes under T7ɸ10 control (22). The low copy number plasmid pHSG575 (23Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) was used for the construction of a B. subtilis gene library and for the construction of a number of subclones carrying various segments of the opuA region (Fig. 1). Strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to propagate the B. subtilis gene library. The low copy number T7 expression plasmids pPD100 and pPD101 (24Dersch P. Fsihi H. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were used to express the genes of the opuA operon under the control of the T7ɸ10 promoter. Plasmid pJL29 is a pBR322-derived vector for the construction of protein fusions to a truncated ′lacZ gene(25Lucht J.M. Dersch P. Kempf B. Bremer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6578-6586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it was used here for the isolation of the Φ(opuAA-lacZ)hyb1 hybrid gene. The E. coli-B. subtilis shuttle vector pRB373 has been described(26Brückner R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA cartridges encoding genes conferring resistance to kanamycine or tetracycline were isolated from plasmids pAT21 and pBEST307, respectively(27Trieu-Cuot P. Courvalin P. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 23: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 28Itaya M. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992; 56: 685-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bacillus Genetic Stock Center base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) minimal medium A Spizizen's minimal medium. Bacteria were grown aerobically at 37°C in LB, MMA glucose (0.2%), or Spizizen's minimal medium (SMM) supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 20 mg/liter L-tryptophan, 18 mg/liter L-phenylalanine, and a solution of trace elements (29, 30). The osmolarity of the various media was increased by addition of NaCl from a highly concentrated (5 M) stock solution. The osmolarity of media was determined with a vapor pressure osmometer (model 5500; Wescor Inc., Logan, UT). Expression of the opuA genes under T7ɸ10 control was carried out in cells grown in M9 minimal medium (29Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casaminoacids. To select derivatives of strain MKH13 synthesizing glycine betaine transporters encoded by cloned B. subtilis DNA, we used MMA minimal agar plates containing 0.2% glucose as the carbon source, 0.8 M NaCl and 1 mM glycine betaine. Plates for the detection of extracellular α-amylase (AmyE) activity contained 1% starch in LB agar plates. Production of AmyE by B. subtilis strains was detected by flooding the colonies grown on LB starch plates with Gram's iodine stain (0.5% (w/v) iodine, 1% (w/v) potassium iodide) for 1 min and scoring for zones of clearing around the colony after decanting the stain(31Cutting S.M. Vander Horn P.B. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1990: 27-74Google Scholar). The AroI phenotype of B. subtilis strains was tested by scoring the growth of colonies on SMM minimal plates either lacking or containing 20 mg/liter L-tryptophan, 18 mg/liter L-phenylalanine, and 20 mg/liter L-tyrosine; AroI− strains can not grow on minimal plates lacking these aromatic amino acids. The antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and kanamycin were used in E. coli at a final concentration of 100, 30, 5, and 15 μg/ml, respectively. Kanamycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin were used in B. subtilis at a final concentration of 5, 10, and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. The cyclic peptide antibiotic globomycin, a specific inhibitor of signal peptidase II(32Inukai M. Nakajima M. sawa M. Haneishi T. Arai M. J. Antibiot. 1978; 31: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by M. Inukai from Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Japan). A stock solution (10 mg/ml) of globomycin was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to cultures to a final concentration of 120 μg/ml. Radiolabeled [1-14C]glycine betaine (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from ARC (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO), radiolabeled [35S]methionine (523 mCi/mmol) was obtained from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany), and [35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Routine manipulations of plasmid DNA, the isolation of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis, and the detection of homologous sequences by Southern hybridization were all carried out by standard techniques(33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNA and of single-stranded DNA segments cloned in M13BM20 or M13BM21 (Boehringer Mannheim) was carried out using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) and the conditions recommended by the supplier. Sequencing reactions were primed with a number of synthetic oligonucleotide primers spaced along the opuA region. The entire 5.2-kb EcoRI insert present in plasmid pBKB1 (Fig. 1) was used to generate a probe by random nucleotide labeling using DIG-dUTP (DIG DNA labeling and detection kit, Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization of the labeled DNA fragment to EcoRI- and PstI-digested chromosomal DNA isolated from various B. subtilis strains was performed according to the instructions of the supplier, and the hybridization products were detected using LumiPhos 530 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Total RNA was prepared from cultures grown to mid-log phase (A578 = 0.5) in either LB medium or LB medium of high osmolarity (0.5 M NaCl added) of the B. subtilis strain JH642 carrying the opuAA-lacZ fusion plasmid pBKB56 essentially as described by Völker et al.(5Völker U. Engelmann S. Maul B. Riethdorf S. Völker A. Schmidt R. Mach H. Hecker M. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 741-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The RNA was further purified by passage through a Quiagen tip-100 column as suggested by the supplier (Diagen, Düsseldorf, Germany). The total amount of RNA isolated was spectrophotometrically (A260) determined; an A260 of 1 corresponds to approximately 40 μg/ml RNA(33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For the primer extension reaction, a synthetic primer (5′-GAACTGCCTTCTTTGTTTGTTTCCC-3′), complementary to the opuAA mRNA (position 283-307 bp; see Fig. 3) was hybridized with 5 μg of RNA and extended with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) in the presence of radiolabeled [35S]dATP at a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. The size of the reaction products was determined on a 4% DNA sequencing gel under denaturing conditions and visualized by autoradiography. A sequencing ladder produced by using the same primer was run on the same sequencing gel to determine the precise 5′ ends of the opuA mRNAs. Transformation of competent B. subtilis cells with plasmids and linear DNA fragments was done according to routine procedures(31Cutting S.M. Vander Horn P.B. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1990: 27-74Google Scholar). A library of chromosomal DNA segments from the B. subtilis wild-type strain JH642 was prepared by cleaving chromosomal DNA with EcoRI and ligating the resulting restriction fragments into the EcoRI site in the polylinker of the lacZ α-complementing plasmid pHSG575. The DNA of the recombinant plasmids was transformed into strain DH5α, and colonies were selected on LB plates containing chloramphenicol, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM), and x-gal (40 μg/ml). Approximately 90% of the obtained transformants (40,000 colonies) carried plasmids with cloned B. subtilis DNA as judged from their LacZ− phenotype. All colonies were pooled and grown for 2 h in LB medium with chloramphenicol; the plasmid DNA was then extracted and used to transform the E. coli strain MKH13. Plasmids pBKB13, pBKB14, pBKB17, pBKB18, pBKB38, and pBKB46 were constructed by deleting defined restriction fragments from the opuA+ plasmids pBKB1 and religating the plasmid backbones (Fig. 1). Plasmids pBKB15, pBKB35, and pBKB39 were isolated by cloning appropriate restriction fragments isolated from plasmid pBKB1 into the vector pHSG575 (Fig. 1). Plasmid pBKB33 carries the entire opuA operon on a 4-kb EcoRI-EcoRV restriction fragment (Fig. 1) that has been cloned into the polylinker sequence of the T7ɸ10 expression vector pPD100, thus positioning opuA under T7ɸ10 control. The same restriction fragment was inserted in the reverse orientation with respect to the T7ɸ10 promoter present in the vector pPD101, yielding plasmid pBKB34. Plasmid pBKB44, which expresses the opuAA+opuAB+ genes under T7ɸ10 control was constructed by deleting a 636-bp Nsi I fragment carrying most of the opuAC gene (Fig. 1) from the opuA+ plasmid pBKB33. To achieve expression of the opuAA+ gene under T7ɸ10 control, a 1.7-kb Eco RI- Hpa I restriction fragment (Fig. 1) was inserted into the vector pPD100, yielding plasmid pBKB43. A plasmid expressing the opuAC+ gene under T7ɸ10 control was constructed by isolating a 1.4-kb Apa LI- Not I fragment from pBKB1; the overhanging ends of the restriction fragments were filled in with Klenow enzyme and then ligated into the Sma I site of plasmid pPD100. Plasmids positioning the opuAC gene under T7ɸ10 control (pBKB58) or aligning it in the reverse orientation with the T7ɸ10 promoter (pBKB57) were identified by restriction analysis. To construct an opuAA - lacZ gene fusion, a 1.3-kb Eco RI- Sna BI restriction fragment from pBKB1 (Fig. 1) was cloned into the Eco RI and Sma I sites of the ′lacZ fusion vector pJL29, yielding plasmid pBKB54. In this plasmid, the reading frames of opuAA and ′lacZ are properly aligned across the Sna BI and Sma I junction, thus generating a hybrid protein fusion, Φ(opuAA - lacZ) hyb1. The entire hybrid gene was transferred from plasmid pBKB54 on a 4.4-kb Eco RI- Dra I restriction fragment into the E. coli - B. subtilis shuttle vector pRB373, which had been cut with Eco RI and Sma I; this construction resulted in plasmid pBKB56. Uptake of glycine betaine in B. subtilis and E. coli was measured using [1-14C]glycine betaine (55 mCi/mmol) as a substrate. The cells were grown to mid-exponential phase (A578 = 0.15-0.5) in minimal medium with glucose as the carbon source and used immediately for the transport assay. E. coli strains were grown in MMA or MMA with 0.2 M NaCl, and B. subtilis strains were grown in SMM or SMM with 0.4 M NaCl. The uptake assay contained [1-14C]glycine betaine at a final substrate concentration of 10 μM (5.5 mCi/mmol) in a total reaction volume of 2 ml. Samples (0.3 ml) were taken at various times and filtered through 0.45 μm-pore-size filters (Schleicher and Schuell GmbH, Dassel, Germany). The cells were washed with 20 ml of isotonic minimal salts, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was determined in a scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined from total cell extracts using the Bio-Rad protein assay with acetylated bovine serum albumin as the standard. The cell extracts were prepared by passing the B. subtilis cells five times through a French press cell at 103,000 kilopascals. Cultures (20 ml in a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask) of strain JH642 carrying the opuAA-lacZ fusion plasmid pBKB56 were grown overnight at 37°C in LB medium or LB medium with 0.5 M NaCl. The optical density (A578) of the cultures was determined and adjusted to A578=5. From each culture, 2-ml portions were withdrawn, the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 150 μl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 8.0), and 15 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml in H2O) was added. The cell suspension was then incubated for 8 min at 37°C in a water bath, 50 μl of 4-fold concentrated sample buffer (final concentration, 0.06 M Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3% dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue) was added, and the cells were lysed by incubation for 5 min at 95°C. To reduce the viscosity of the cell extract, 2 μl of benzon nuclease (Merck) was added and incubated for 10 min at 37°C, followed by another short (5-min) incubation at 95°C. Aliquots of the cell extracts were then immediately loaded onto 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels(34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), and the proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (33). For the immunological detection of the OpuAA′-β-galactosidase hybrid protein, total cellular extracts were electrophoretically separated on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a sheet of Immobilon (Millipore, Eschwege, Germany). The bound proteins were probed with a rabbit β-galactosidase antiserum, and the antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with a second goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (Boehringer Mannheim) as substrates. Plasmids carrying various genes from the opuA operon under the transcriptional control of the T7ɸ10 promoter were transformed into strain BL21(λDE3) to selectively visualize the opuA-encoded proteins. These plasmids are pBKB33 (opuAA+opuAB+opuAC+), pBKB44 (opuAA+opuAB+), pBKB43 (opuAA+), and pBKB58 (opuAC+). Plasmids pBKB34 and pBKB57 carrying the opuA+ operon and opuAC+ gene, respectively, improperly aligned with respect to the T7 promoter were used as controls. Cultures (20 ml in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks) of strain BL21(λDE3) carrying the various plasmids were grown in M9 minimal medium with 0.2% casaminoacids to mid-log phase (A578 = 0.5-0.7); the cells were washed with M9 minimal medium, resuspended in 20 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% methionine assay medium (Difco), and grown for 1 h at 37°C. T7ɸ10-mediated gene expression was initiated by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to a final substrate concentration of 1 mM, after 30 min rifampicin was added (200 μg/ml) to inhibit the E. coli RNA polymerase. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, 1-ml portions of the cultures were withdrawn, the proteins were labeled for three min with [35S]methionine (final concentration, 5.2 nCi/ml), and the cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Portions (30 μl) of the cell extracts were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins were electrophoretically separated, and radiolabeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. To inhibit signal peptidase II, the antibiotic globomycin was added to the appropriate cultures 10 min prior to the radiolabeling of the proteins. Analysis of nucleotide sequences from the opuA region and the alignment and analysis of protein sequences was performed with the Lasergene program from DNA Star (DNASTAR, Ltd., London) on an Apple Macintosh II computer. Multiple sequence alignments were done at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BLAST programs and the current versions of the available data bases (November, 1994)(35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71457) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the opuA region (see Fig. 3) reported in this paper has been submitted to the GenBank™/EMBL Data Bank with accession number U17292. To clone genes from B. subtilis that code for glycine betaine transporters, we capitalized on the growth properties of the E. coli mutant strain MKH13. This strain is defective for glycine betaine synthesis and also lacks the glycine betaine transport systems, ProP and ProU(21Haardt M. Kempf B. Faatz E. Bremer E. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is severely impaired in its ability to cope with a high osmolarity environment and, in contrast to its parental strain MC4100, cannot grow in high osmolarity media containing the osmoprotectant glycine betaine. We reasoned that it should be possible to functionally complement the deficiency of strain MKH13 in glycine betaine uptake with the appropriate B. subtilis genes. A gene bank of EcoRI restriction fragments was prepared from chromosomal DNA of the B. subtilis strain JH642 in the low copy number cloning vector pHSG575 (Cmr) and transformed into MKH13 by selecting for Cmr colonies on LB agar plates. These transformants were then replica-plated on high osmolarity minimal plates (MMA agar plates with 0.8 M NaCl) containing 1 mM glycine betaine to search for MKH13 derivatives that could grow under these selective conditions. Such strains were readily obtained, and each of the 46 MKH13 derivatives analyzed carried the same pHSG575-derived plasmid containing a 5.2-kb EcoRI restriction fragment. A restriction map of one of these plasmids, pBKB1, is shown in Fig. 1. The ability of strain MKH13(pBKB1) to grow at high osmolarity in the presence of 1 mM glycine betaine was shown to be dependent on the presence of plasmid pBKB1 by retransformation into strain MKH13. There was no growth of MKH13(pBKB1) in high osmolarity minimal medium (MMA agar plates with 0.8 M NaCl) lacking this osmoprotectant. Osmoprotection by glycine betaine requires the intracellular accumulation of this compound(1Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Lucht J.M. Bremer E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 14: 3-20Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the initial [1-14C]glycine betaine uptake in cultures of strain MKH13(pBKB1) grown in low osmolarity or high osmolarity minimal media at a final substrate concentration of 10 μM.

The pleiotropic effects of HGF are mediated by its binding to a specific high affinity receptor, c-Met. In addition, HGF binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix. Incubation of HGF with 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μg/ml of heparin, heparan sulfate, or dextran sulfate resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in mitogenic potency in a primary rat hepatocyte bioassay, whereas sodium sulfate or fucoidan did not. Although co-incubation of HGF with sulfated compounds that enhanced HGF-dependent mitogenesis did not alter the binding isotherm of HGF for the c-Met receptor in a solid phase assay, an increase in autophosphorylation of the c-Met receptor in intact A549 cells was observed upon their addition. A series of chemically sulfated malto-oligosaccharides varying in unit size and charge was tested in the bioassay in order to provide additional insights into the nature of the HGF-heparin interaction. While sulfated di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides did not significantly potentiate HGF-dependent mitogenesis, larger oligosaccharides such as the sulfated hexa-, hepta-, or a sulfated oligosaccharide mixture containing decasaccharides resulted in an approximate 2-, 4-, and 7-fold enhancement, respectively. We observed a correlation between the sulfated oligosaccharide preparations that enhanced mitogenic potency and those that promoted HGF oligomerization in vitro, as measured by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. These findings indicate that heparin-like molecules can stabilize HGF oligomers, which may facilitate c-Met receptor dimerization and activation.

In addition to being an important mitogen in liver growth and regeneration, HGF is thought to be a critical factor in embryogenesis, angiogenesis, and wound healing. Indeed, HGF has mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic activity on various epithelial and endothelial cell types in culture (for review, see Ref. 1). A relatively large (82-84 kDa) growth factor with sequence similarity to plasminogen(2Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugiura A. Tashhiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar), HGF is secreted as a single-chain promitogen. It requires endoproteolytic processing at the Arg494-Val495 bond by an extracellular serine protease to produce an active heterodimer(3Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A.

Processing to the heterodimer results in an α-chain (69 kDa) consisting of a N-terminal hairpin loop followed by four kringle domains. The β-chain (32 kDa) bears sequence similarity to serine proteases, although the Ser and His residues critical for catalysis are absent(2Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugiura A. Tashhiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar).Structure-function studies indicate that a region within the N-terminal 175 amino acids of HGF is necessary and sufficient for receptor binding, although additional determinants within the β-chain are required for full mitogenic activity(6Lokker N.A. Presta L.G. Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The effect of HGF on DNA synthesis, motility, and cell morphology are thought to be mediated by binding to a single high affinity (Kd = 20-30 pM) tyrosine kinase receptor called c-Met(7Bottaro D.P.

Gaudino G. Zarnegar R. Michalopoulos G.K. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1989; 6: 501-504Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that autophosphorylation of these receptors results from ligand-induced receptor dimerization, with subsequent transphosphorylation of cytoplasmic domains(9Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Dimeric growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, induce receptor dimerization when each molecule of the dimer binds independently to a separate receptor(10Heldin C.H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A bivalent receptor binding mechanism has also been demonstrated for non-kinase receptors such as the growth hormone receptor(11Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.A. Wells J.A. DeMeyts P.

In this case, the ligand is a monomer but contains two receptor binding sites that can induce receptor dimerization by forming a 1:2 (ligand-receptor) complex(12Cunnungham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M.

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar).Although the primary sequence of HGF is distinct from other known polypeptide mitogens, HGF is similar to a growing list of growth factors with respect to its affinity for heparin(14Nakamura T. Teramoto K. Ichihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6489-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 15Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HGF, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF and aFGF, respectively), vascular endothelial cell growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor bind tightly to heparin affinity columns and require high concentrations of NaCl (≥0.8 M) for elution. Domain deletion mutants of HGF deficient in either the N-terminal hairpin loop or the second kringle domain do not bind to heparin affinity columns, suggesting that the ability of HGF to bind heparin may reside in one or both of these domains(16Mizuno K. Inoue H. Hagiya M. Shimizu S. Nose T. Shimohigashi Y. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1131-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the primary sequence within these domains revealed a cluster of basic amino acids, presumed to be important for binding anionic heparin or heparin-like molecules.HGF binding to heparin in vitro may signify a biologically important interaction with heparan sulfate (HS) in vivo. HS is similar in composition and structure to heparin (for review, see Refs. 17-19) and is a major component of proteoglycans expressed on cell surfaces and secreted into the extracellular matrix(20Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies indicate that hepatocytes possess a large number of heparin elutable (Kd 260-400 pM) binding sites for HGF (21Tajima H. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that as much as 85% of HGF bound on the cell surface may be released by washing with heparin(22Naka D. Ishii T. Shimomura T. Hishidam T. Hara H. Exp Cell Res. 1993; 209: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Although heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are found on all mammalian cell surfaces, their structures are cell type- and possibly differentiation-specific. Emerging evidence suggests that HSPGs serve as important regulators of cellular signaling by modulating the stability, diffusability, and biological activity of heparin binding growth factors(19Jackson R.L. Busch S.T. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). For example, Yayon et al. demonstrated that the interaction of bFGF with cell surface HSPGs, or exogenous soluble heparin, was required for high affinity binding and receptor activation(23Yayon A. Klagsburn M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). They proposed that HSPG or heparin binding may change the conformation of bFGF to allow for a higher affinity interaction between bFGF and its receptor. More recently, an alternative mechanism has been proposed for aFGF. In this case, soluble heparin induced oligomerization of aFGF, resulting in subsequent FGF receptor dimerization and activation(24Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Heparin-like molecules are also apparently required for the interaction of vascular endothelial cell growth factor with high affinity receptors on vascular endothelial cells(25Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tessler S. Rockwell P. Hicklin D. Cohen T. Levi B. Witte L. Lemischka I.R. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12456-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to FGF, investigations of the physiological importance of glycosaminoglycan binding to HGF are limited. In the present study, we investigated the effect of heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, and a series of sulfated oligosaccharides of defined unit size on HGF-dependent mitogenesis. We demonstrate that heparin (0.1-10 μg/ml) and other highly sulfated oligosaccharides are capable of enhancing the potency of HGF and of increasing c-Met receptor phosphorylation in the presence of HGF. Investigations into the biochemical mechanism(s) underlying this effect revealed a correlation between compounds that enhanced mitogenic activity and those that promoted HGF oligomerization. We postulate, therefore, that heparan sulfate and related molecules promote the stability of HGF oligomers, which subsequently promotes receptor dimerization and activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsLow molecular weight heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, malto-oligosaccharides (from maltose through maltoheptaose), and a malto-oligosaccharide mixture (maltotetraose-decaose mixture) containing 4-10 glucose units were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Malto-oligosaccharides were chemically sulfated using pyridine-sulfur trioxide complex (27Fugedi P. Stack R.J. Ishihara M. (1992) 16th International Carbohydrate Symposium. July 5-10, 1992; (Paris, France): B069Google Scholar) and desalted by gel filtration on columns of Bio-Gel P-4 resin (Bio-Rad). Size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA). Anti-HGF polyclonal antibodies were raised in guinea pigs. Several bleeds were pooled and partially purified by saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Protein A chromatography. Anti-c-Met-IgG antibodies were raised in rabbits and purified as described above. The biotin-conjugated antiphosphotyrosine antibodies and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin used for immunoblotting were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Chemiluminescent substrate was purchased from Tropix (Bedford, MA), and [3H]thymidine was obtained from Amersham Corp.Preparation of Recombinant HGFThe heterodimeric form of recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells using a procedure modified from that of Naka et al. (4). rhHGF-transfected cells were grown in a 400-liter bioreactor in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 8 days. Culture supernatant was clarified and concentrated and then conditioned by the addition of solid NaCl to 0.3 M. rhHGF was purified in a single step using cation-exchange chromatography as follows: conditioned, concentrated culture supernatant was loaded onto a column of S-Sepharose Fast Flow equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl. After washing out unbound protein, rhHGF was eluted in a linear gradient from 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl to 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1.2 M NaCl. rhHGF-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE analysis, concentrated, and exchanged into 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25. This material, at a final concentration of 3-5 mg/ml, was stored frozen, and aliquots were thawed for subsequent use. Protein was quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm (A0.1% = 2.2).Preparation of c-Met Receptor-IgG Fusion Proteinc-Met-IgG was constructed as described by Mark et al.(28Mark M.R. Lokker N.A. Zioncheck T.F. Luis E.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26166-26171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The c-Met-IgG was purified in a single step using affinity chromatography on immobilized Protein A (Bioprocessing, Inc., Princeton, NJ), using an elution scheme modified from a previously described procedure(29Chamow S.M. Zhang D.Z. Mhatre S.M. Tan X.Y. Peers D.H. Marsters S.A. Byrn R.A. Ashkenazi A. Junghans R.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4268-4280PubMed Google Scholar). This material, at a final concentration of 2-4 mg/ml, was stored frozen, and aliquots were thawed for subsequent use. Protein was quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm (A0.1% = 1.05).HGF BioassayThe biological activity of rhHGF was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation into rat hepatocyte DNA in primary culture as described previously(3Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B. Godowski P.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were isolated from the livers of female Sprague-Dawley rats (180-220 g, obtained from Harlan) by perfusing a 0.02% collagenase solution through the portal vein. After washing in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, hepatocytes were washed and resuspended in serum-free medium (Williams Medium A, glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 1 μg/ml insulin, gentamicin, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) to a final concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml. Hepatocytes (100 μl/well) were added to 96-well microtiter plates containing 100 μl/well of assay medium, HGF, and, when indicated, HGF in the presence of sulfated oligosaccharides. After overnight incubation, at 37°C in 5% CO2, [3H]thymidine (0.5-1.0 μCi/well) was added to each well, and the incubation was continued overnight. Cells were harvested using a Packard Filtermate Harvester, and radioactivity was measured using a Packard Microplate scintillation counter.c-Met Autophosphorylation in A549 CellsHuman lung carcinoma cells (A549) were plated at 2 × 106 cells/150 cm2 culture dish in RPMI 1640 medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin streptomycin solution (JRH Biosciences) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were grown in monolayer to approximately 80% confluence before changing to serum-free medium (RPMI 1640 medium, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24-48 h; spent medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing 5 ng/ml rhHGF in the presence or absence of sulfated maltohexaose. After 5 min at 37°C, medium was removed and cells were washed in cold PBS 2 times prior to the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 4 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mMp-nitrophenylphosphate). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were then immunoprecipitated by adding anti-c-Met-IgG polyclonal antibodies for 2 h followed by protein-G Sepharose for 0.5 h. Immune complexes were washed 3 times in PBS prior to boiling in 2× sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized using a biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody followed by streptavidin with chemiluminescence detection.Binding of rhHGF to c-Met Receptor-IgG Fusion ProteinThe effect of heparin on rhHGF binding to c-Met was tested using a microtiter plate assay. Affinity-purified F(ab′)2 rabbit anti-human IgG, Fc-specific, was adsorbed to each well (0.2 μg) by overnight incubation at 2-8°C. The solution was discarded, and 150 μl of blocking buffer (PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% thimerosal, pH 7.4) was added to each well for 1.5 h. Wells were washed 6 × with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (wash buffer) prior to adding c-Met receptor-IgG fusion protein. The fusion protein was allowed to bind for 3 h, and the wells were washed again. rhHGF standards (0.27-200 ng/ml) were added to the appropriate wells in the presence or absence of 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μg/ml heparin or heparin-like compounds. Biotinylated polyclonal anti-HGF was added and incubated for 1.75 h. Plates were washed and horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin conjugate was added and allowed to incubate for an additional 1.75 h at ambient temperature with gentle agitation. Plates were washed 6 times with wash buffer, and 100 μl of substrate (o-phenylenediamine) solution was added. The colored reaction product was allowed to develop for 5 min before adding 50 μl of stopping solution (4.5 N H2SO4) to all wells. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured, and concentrations were determined from standard curves.Determination of rhHGF Apparent Molecular Weight by Size Exclusion HPLCThe apparent molecular weight of rhHGF in the presence and absence of sulfated oligosaccharides in buffers of varying ionic strength was measured by size exclusion HPLC. Molecular weight standards were used for calibration. rhHGF was diluted into PBS, pH 7.2, to a final concentration of 0.26 mg/ml, and sulfated compounds were added at 10 μg/ml unless otherwise stated. Samples were analyzed using a TSK-Gel (TosoHaas) G3000SW XL column using a flow rate of 1 ml/min at ambient temperature. Chromatography was carried out using a PBS mobile phase, and rhHGF was detected in the eluant by monitoring absorbance at 280 nm.Analytical UltracentrifugationSedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted in a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge using charcoal-filled Epon six-channel Yphantis cells(30Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 317-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). rhHGF was diluted with PBS, pH 7.2, to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and then incubated with sulfated oligosaccharides at various concentrations. Experiments were performed at rotor speeds of 10,000 and 15,000 rpm at 20°C. The attainment of equilibrium was verified by comparing successive scans. The partial specific volume of rhHGF (0.714 ml/g) was calculated from its amino acid and average carbohydrate composition. The sedimentation data were edited using a PC program, REEDIT (kindly provided by Dr. David Yphantis, University of Connecticut). Data points were truncated around the bottom of cell and meniscus regions to avoid nonlinear deviation or base-line noise. The average molecular weight was obtained by fitting the data as a single ideal species using a nonlinear least squares method(31Johnson M.L. Correia J.C. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 578-588Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (778) Google Scholar).RESULTSHeparin, Heparan Sulfate, and Dextran Sulfate Enhanced the Mitogenic Activity of rhHGFPrevious work has demonstrated that HGF is a potent mitogen for primary cultures of rat hepatocytes(32Nakamura T. Nawa K. Ichihara A. Kaise N. Nishino T. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 33Strain A. Ismail T. Tsubouchi H. Arakaki N. Hishida T. Kikamura N. Daikuhara Y. McMaster P. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1853-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing concentrations of rhHGF results in a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with mitogenic activity increasing from 1 to 100 ng/ml and declining at higher concentrations. We used this assay to study the effect of heparin and heparin-like molecules on the mitogenic activity of HGF. As expected, addition of rhHGF alone, at concentrations of 1-100 ng/ml resulted in a dose-dependent increase in DNA synthesis. Co-incubation of rhHGF with heparin (0.1-10 μg/ml) in this assay resulted in an increase in rhHGF potency (decrease in the EC50). This effect was maximal at a heparin concentration of 10 μg/ml. Higher concentrations of heparin (100 μg/ml) were not as effective and in some cases inhibited HGF action. Fig. 1A shows a representative experiment in which HGF was co-incubated with heparin at three different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μg/ml) prior to addition to primary rat hepatocyte cultures.The specificity of this effect was examined by testing other sulfated compounds such as heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, fucoidan, and Na2SO4 at 10 μg/ml. Inclusion of heparin or heparan sulfate resulted in an approximate 3-5-fold enhancement in rhHGF potency (Fig. 1B). There was little or no significant difference in the maximal mitogenic response, which occurred at an rhHGF concentration of 100 ng/ml. Dextran sulfate showed a slightly greater (5-7-fold) enhancement of rhHGF-dependent mitogenesis than heparin, suggesting that the potentiation effect was not specific for glycosaminoglycans. The charge density of dextran sulfate varies, but it is generally higher than that of heparin. These sulfated polysaccharides did not increase [3H]thymidine uptake in the absence of rhHGF over the time course of the experiment. Interestingly, neither fucoidan (a polysaccharide containing sulfated fucose) nor sodium sulfate (0.1-10 μg/ml) had any enhancing effect when tested in this assay (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that enhancement of HGF-dependent mitogenesis does not specifically require N-sulfation (as found in heparin or HS) but that compounds with high negative charge and only O-sulfation can increase rhHGF potency in a mitogenic assay. These results prompted us to examine the effects of a highly sulfated series of chemically sulfated malto-oligosaccharides.The Effect of Sulfated Oligosaccharide Unit Size on rhHGF ActivityA series of chemically sulfated malto-oligosaccharides varying in size from 2 to 7 glucose units was prepared in an attempt to define minimal size requirements for modulating rhHGF activity. We observed that rhHGF potency could be enhanced by the addition of such compounds, but the enhancement was dependent on oligosaccharide unit size. Sulfated malto-oligosaccharide 6 glucose units or larger significantly stimulated HGF-dependent mitogenesis (Table I), whereas the sulfated di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides showed no significant enhancement. While the effect of sulfated maltopentaose was variable, the sulfated maltohexaose or maltoheptaose at 10 μg/ml increased the potency of rhHGF (approximately 2- and 4-fold, respectively). Importantly, malto-oligosaccharides did not enhance HGF-dependent mitogenesis if they were not chemically sulfated (data not shown), suggesting the observed effect is related to both oligosaccharide size and charge.Table I:The effect of oligosaccharide unit size on the potentiation of HGF-dependent mitogenesis Open table in a new tab A second sulfated hexasaccharide-like compound, bis-(β-maltotriosyl)ethylene glycol sulfate, was prepared by chemically linking two maltotriose sulfate units with an ethylene glycol bridge(34Fügedi P. Petö C.S. Ishihara M. Musser J.H. 17th International Carbohydrate Symposium. July 17-22, 1994; : D1.12Google Scholar). The bis-(β-maltotriosyl)ethylene glycol sulfate also significantly enhanced rhHGF activity, whereas the untethered maltotriose sulfate did not. The observed enhancement was comparable with that of maltohexaose sulfate (Table I). These results further demonstrate that sulfated hexasaccharides, but not trisaccharides, are capable of potentiating rhHGF action.An additional experiment was performed with a sulfated mixture of malto-oligosaccharides containing 4-10 glucose units, as pure malto-oligosaccharides containing 8 or more glucose units are not commercially available. Interestingly, this mixture of sulfated oligosaccharides enhanced HGF potency to the same degree (5-7-fold) as high molecular weight polymers such as dextran sulfate. The relative effects of sulfated maltotetraose, maltoheptaose, and the maltotetra-decaose mixture are shown graphically in Fig. 2.Figure 2:The effect of oligosaccharide unit size on HGF dependent mitogenesis. HGF (0.1-100 ng/ml) was added to primary cultures of rat hepatocytes in the presence and absence (control) of 10 μg/ml of sulfated maltotetraose (Tetrasaccharide), sulfated maltoheptaose (Heptasaccharide), or sulfated maltotetraose-decaose mixture (Decasaccharide). Data represent the average cpm/well (n = 3) ± S.D. for a given HGF concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Incubation of rhHGF with Maltohexaose Sulfate Enhances c-Met PhosphorylationAutophosphorylation is the earliest detectable event in the mitogenic signaling cascade. Addition of rhHGF results in an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of c-Met expressed by A549 cells(3Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L. Robbins K.A. Baker J.B. Godowski P.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To investigate one possible mechanism by which sulfated compounds might enhance rhHGF potency, we compared the phosphorylation state of the c-Met receptor in A549 cells after the addition of rhHGF (5 ng/ml), rhHGF, and sulfated maltohexaose (10 μg/ml) or sulfated maltohexaose alone (Fig. 3). The addition of the sulfated hexasaccharide alone (in the absence of HGF) did not change the phosphotyrosine content of the c-Met receptor β subunit (145 kDa) above basal levels (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, co-incubation of rhHGF (5 ng/ml) and the sulfated hexasaccharide resulted in a distinct and reproducible increase in phosphorylation of the c-Met β subunit, as compared with the above, or as compared with cells treated with rhHGF alone. The phosphotyrosine content of the c-Met receptor after treatment with 5 ng/ml rhHGF plus sulfated hexasaccharide was similar to the level of phosphorylation typically observed after treatment with a 10-fold higher concentration (50 ng/ml) of rhHGF alone (compare lanes 4 and 6). Interestingly, the sulfated compound had no effect on the phosphorylation state of c-Met receptor when rhHGF was present at relatively high concentrations (50 ng/ml). In addition, we also observed an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylation of a 60-kDa protein in cells treated with rhHGF in the presence of the sulfated compound. These results suggest that activation of the c-Met receptor is enhanced by lower levels of rhHGF when highly sulfated hexasaccharides (and presumably larger o"

Type II hexokinase, which is expressed at high levels in such cells and bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane, has been implicated as a major player in this aberrant metabolism. Here we report the isolation and sequence of a 4.3-kilobase pair proximal promoter region of the Type II hexokinase gene from a rapidly growing, highly glycolytic hepatoma cell line (AS-30D). Analysis of the sequence enabled the identification of putative promoter elements, including a TATA box, a CAAT element, several Sp-1 sites, and response elements for glucose, insulin, cAMP, Ap-1, and a number of other factors. Transfection experiments with AS-30D cells showed that promoter activity was enhanced 3.4-, 3.3-, 2.4-, 2.1-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, by glucose, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a phorbol ester), insulin, cAMP, and glucagon. In transfected hepatocytes, these same agents produced little or no effect. The results emphasize normal versus tumor cell differences in the regulation of Type II hexokinase and indicate that transcription of the Type II tumor gene may occur independent of metabolic state, thus, providing the cancer cell with a selective advantage over its cell of origin.

Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), an important regulator of hexokinase in normal cells (3, 13-16). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the tumor enzyme (17Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) may also play a role in this process but remains to be investigated. Although the mitochondrial bound hexokinase phenotype is also observed for some normal tissues including brain and skeletal muscle(18Wilson J.E. Beitner R.K. Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 45-85Google Scholar), it is much less than that observed in rapidly growing cancer cells. The overproduction of hexokinase in cancer cells has been given only modest attention, but has nevertheless resulted in the important observation that mRNA levels for this critical key enzyme are also markedly elevated(19Johansson T. Berrez J-M. Nelson B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Paggi M.G. Fanciulli M. Carlo C.D. Citro G. Bruno T. Floridi A. Biochem.

Therefore, it is of critical importance to elucidate the mechanism of hexokinase transcription in cancer cells in order to identify those factors responsible for its overexpression. In addition, the identification of factors involved in the transcriptional overexpression of hexokinase in tumor cells may also uncover novel signal transduction cascades that are initiated when a cell acquires the cancer phenotype. To address the issue of enhanced transcriptional regulation of hexokinase in tumor cells, we chose to study the highly glycolytic, rapidly growing hepatoma cell line AS-30D. This cell line has been characterized in detail in this laboratory with respect to its high glycolysis and the role in this process of mitochondrial bound hexokinase(3Bustamante E. Pedersen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3735-3739Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Pedersen P.L.

Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar). Of the four common hexokinase types (I, II, III, and IV (glucokinase)), it is the Type II, and to a lesser extent, the Type I isozyme that are overexpressed in rapidly growing, highly glycolytic tumors(12Parry D.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10904-10912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Scott L.J. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 913-919PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, studies reported in this paper utilized a PCR generated probe derived from the Type II hexokinase cDNA(23Thelen A.P. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), corresponding to the first exon(24Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to screen an AS-30D hepatoma genomic library. As indicated in detail below, the resultant studies led to the cloning and sequencing of the Type II tumor hexokinase promoter, the identification of a number of response elements, and evidence that a number of these elements may play a role in the regulation of tumor Type II hexokinase gene transcription. λ-Fix II phage DNA and Gigapack II Gold packaging extracts were from Stratagene, BA-85 nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher and Schuell, [α-32P]dATP and [α-35S]dATP were from DuPont NEN. The original source for the Type II hexokinase cDNA clone from rat skeletal muscle was Dr. John E. Wilson, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI. Sequenase V. 2.0 and single strand binding protein were from United States Biochemicals. pGL-2 vector series and pSV-β-galactosidase control vector were from Promega. Chemiluminescence was measured using a TD-20e luminometer (Turner Designs/Promega). Electroporation was carried out in a Cell-Porator electroporator (Life Technologies, Inc.). Other plasmids, restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, DNA and RNA molecular weight standards were from Life Technologies, Inc. RPMI 1640 (glucose-deficient) tissue culture media, hormones, and growth factor analogs were from Sigma. Plasmid DNA was purified using Nucleobond-AX (Nest Group, Inc.) or Qiagen Maxi-prep (Qiagen, Inc.) plasmid purification columns. AS-30D hepatoma cells were propagated in female Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously(6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5702-5706PubMed Google Scholar, 9Arora K.K. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17422-17428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatoma cells, in ascitic form, were harvested 6-7 days post-transplantation. For genomic DNA isolation (see below), the cells were purified by differential centrifugation in Chance-Hess medium (6Nakashima R.A. Paggi M.G. Pedersen P.L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5702-5706PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. For transfection studies, RPMI 1640 medium was used for purification and resuspension. Hepatocytes were isolated from female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) by collagenase perfusion (25Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1987: 264-265Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, after perfusing the liver the hepatocytes were resuspended in 20 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. An equal volume of 90% (v/v) Percoll solution (17 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 81.3 mM MgSO4, 1 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) (26) was added and mixed. The viable hepatocytes were separated by centrifugation (50 × g, 5 min) and washed once in RPMI 1640 medium. Isolation of total RNA from liver, AS-30D cells, brain, and skeletal muscle was performed by phenol-chloroform extraction(27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was size fractionated on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) by capillary transfer, and then UV-cross-linked. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to verify equal RNA sample loading. Expression of Type I hexokinase was studied using an EcoRI/BamHI fragment (0.7 kbp)1 1The abbreviations used are: kbpkilobase pairsATF/CREcyclic AMP response elementAp-1activator protein-1C/EBPCCAAT-enhancer binding proteinHNFhepatocyte nuclear factorTPAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateEtBrethidium bromideSSCsodium chloride-sodium citrate solutionPCRpolymerase chain reaction. of the mouse hepatoma Type I hexokinase cDNA (29Arora K.K.

Genomic DNA was isolated from AS-30D hepatoma cells as described previously(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Partial digestion of the genomic DNA with Sau3AI to generate 10-20 kbp DNA fragments and partial fill-in of the Sau3AI ends with Klenow fragment to create ends which are incompatible with each other, but are complimentary to XhoI partially filled in ends, were carried out as described previously(30Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). Isolation of λ-Fix II phage DNA by a liquid lysate method and modification of λ-Fix II phage DNA to generate XhoI half-site arms, and ligation of the half-site λ-arms to the partially filled-in AS-30D genomic DNA, were carried out also as described previously(30Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). The ligated DNA was packaged in vivo using Gigapack II Gold packaging extract according to manufacturer's instructions. The recombinants were screened on duplicate nitrocellulose membranes (132 mm) at a density of 5 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate. A 260-bp PCR generated DNA fragment corresponding to the positions −197 to +63 of Type II hexokinase (translation start point referenced as +1) (23Thelen A.P. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was [α-32P]dATP radiolabeled by nick translation and used as the probe to screen the library. Hybridizations were performed at 42°C for 20 h in a solution consisting of 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg of the labeled probe (2.5 × 106 counts/min in 50 μl). The filters were washed at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS for 2 h, followed by a second wash in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 h, and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT-AR films at −80°C. Six positive λ-clones were identified by autoradiography and plaque-purified. Liquid lysates were prepared from each and DNA isolated as described previously(30Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). DNA (10 μg) from each λ-clone was digested with XbaI, fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred onto a Zeta-probe (Bio-Rad) nylon membrane in 10 × SSC. The membrane was probed using the same 260-bp probe as before. Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 45°C in a solution consisting of 45% formamide, 6 × SSC, 10 mM EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 μg (2.5 × 106 counts/min in 50 ml) of the radiolabeled probe. The membrane was washed sequentially in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature, 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 37°C, 0.1 × SSC, and 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. Hybridized bands were visualized by autoradiography as described before. XbaI-digested DNA fragments which hybridized to the Type II hexokinase cDNA probe upon Southern blot analysis were isolated from each λ-clone by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis under the same conditions as described above, followed by electroelution. The individual DNA fragments were subcloned into the XbaI site of plasmid vector pUC 18. The DNA sequence of one of the inserts was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) in the presence of single strand binding protein (United States Biochemicals) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Manual and automated methods were used to determine the DNA sequence of the insert in both orientations. The promoterless luciferase plasmid vector pGL2-Basic was used for all promoter studies. An SV40 promoter-β-galactosidase reporter vector (pSV-β-galactosidase) was used as an internal control for evaluating the efficiency of transfections in each experiment. An SV40 promoter-luciferase reporter vector (pGL2-Control) was used to evaluate the transcription strength of the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter. The XbaI-digested DNA fragment described above, which contained the proximal promoter region and the first exon of the AS-30D tumor Type II hexokinase gene, as identified by DNA sequencing, was inserted into the compatible NheI site of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-Basic, upstream of the luciferase cDNA. This construct was sequenced at the sites of ligation using synthetic oligonucleotides to verify orientation and accuracy of ligation. A part of the first exon, including the coding region of tumor Type II hexokinase, was excised from the reporter construct by XhoI digestion followed by religation. For transfections, plasmid DNA was purified using Nucleobond-AX or Qiagen Maxi-prep ion-exchange cartridges. The tumor Type II hexokinase promoter-reporter construct (10 μg) or the pGL2-Control vector (10 μg) was transfected with 2.5 μg of the pSV-β-galactosidase vector into AS-30D hepatoma cells using 25 × 106 cells (in 0.5 ml) per transfection. Hepatocytes were transfected with DNA using 20 × 106 cells (in 0.5 ml) per transfection. Briefly, the cells and plasmid DNA were incubated on ice for 10 min and electroporated at 200 V, 800 microfarad. After 10 more min on ice, the cells were plated into 10 ml of RPMI 1640 glucose-deficient media, pH 7.4, supplemented with an antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 mM HEPES, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate or 1 mM sodium lactate. Based on the transfection study, individual cell samples were further supplemented with 25 mM glucose, 100 nM bovine insulin, 10 μM glucagon, 100 μM dibutyryl cAMP, 100 nM TPA, or combinations thereof. The transfected cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cell extracts were prepared 24-h post-transfection using cold lysis buffer (0.625% Triton X-100, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.8)(32Showe M.K. Williams D.L. Showe L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3153-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured as relative light units. The activities were determined essentially as described by the supplier of the reporter vectors (Promega). To determine the expression levels of Type I and II hexokinase in AS-30D hepatoma cells relative to their expression in normal rat liver, Northern blot analysis was carried out on total RNA (Fig. 1). For Type I hexokinase, an EcoRI/BamHI fragment of the c37 mouse hepatoma Type I hexokinase cDNA (29Arora K.K. Fancuilli M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6481-6488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the probe, and for Type II hexokinase a full-length cDNA encoding rat skeletal muscle Type II hexokinase (23Thelen A.P. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used. Both probes showed specific hybridization bands with rat brain and skeletal muscle RNA (Fig. 1, A and B) used as positive controls for Type I and II hexokinase, respectively. As shown both isozymes could be easily detected in AS-30D cells. However, Type II hexokinase showed a much stronger hybridization signal as compared to the Type I isozyme. In normal rat liver neither hexokinase transcript could be detected. To identify the cis-transcriptional control elements that regulate the expression of the tumor Type II hexokinase gene, a 5.1-kbp genomic clone containing the proximal promoter region and the first exon of the tumor Type II hexokinase was isolated and mapped. For the isolation, approximately 5 × 105 plaques were screened from an unamplified AS-30D genomic library packaged at an efficiency of 6.6 × 106 plaque-forming units/μg. Six plaques, which hybridized to a 260-bp PCR amplified probe corresponding to a part of the Type II skeletal muscle hexokinase first exon, were isolated (Fig. 2A). The recombinant phage, denoted 22-1, 22-2, 22-3, 25-1, 27-1, and 29-1, contained genomic DNA inserts in the size range of 10-20 kbp. Recombinant λ-DNA prepared from each isolate was completely digested with XbaI. DNA fragments containing sequences corresponding to the first exon of skeletal muscle Type II hexokinase were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3A) followed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 3B) using the 260-bp PCR product as probe. Specific XbaI digested DNA fragments, in the size range 0.75 kbp (phage 22-1), 5 kbp (phage 22-2 and 29-1), and 9 kbp (phage 22-3, 25-1, and 27-1), were isolated from individual λ-clones and subcloned into the plasmid vector pUC 18. A pUC 18 subclone containing the approximately 5-kbp DNA insert from the λ-clone 29-1 was sequenced at the termini using pUC 18 universal primers to test for the presence of DNA similar to the Type II hexokinase first exon, as described below, and selected for further characterization.Figure 3:Identification of λ-subclones harboring the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter region. DNA from six positive λ-clones (lanes 1-6; clones 22-1, 22-2, 22-3, 25-1, 27-1, and 29-1) were digested with XbaI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (panel A). DNA fragments similar to Type II hexokinase first exon (white bars) were identified by Southern blot analysis (panel B). Molecular weight markers (λ-HindIII), in kbp, are shown to the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 5-kbp subclone, denoted 29-1/XbaI, was sequenced in both directions (Fig. 2B) to yield a full-length DNA sequence of 5150 bp (Fig. 4) containing the promoter, the first exon, and part of the first intron. Analysis of the putative first exon and comparison with the published sequences for the first exon of the Type II hexokinase from adipose tissue (24Printz R.L. Koch S. Potter L.R. O'Doherty R.M. Tiesinga J.J. Moritz S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5209-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (23Thelen A.P. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 286: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) indicated that the corresponding regions within the AS-30D tumor Type II hexokinase are very similar. The 5.1-kbp subclone contained a 257 bp segment of the first intron, a 63 bp coding region of the first exon, a 461 bp untranslated region of the first exon, and a 4369 bp proximal promoter region (Fig. 4). The promoter sequence was analyzed for response elements using available data bases(33Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 34Locker J. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. Oxford U. Press, New York1993: 321-345Google Scholar). Putative response elements found within the promoter by computer analysis are indicated in Fig. 4 below the DNA sequence. Response elements that are sensitive to two of the main signal transduction cascades, the protein kinase A and protein kinase C pathways, and to insulin, glucagon, and glucose are indicated in Fig. 5. Many DNA direct repeats, ranging from 7 to 36 bp, were found within the promoter. Those which are longer than 10 bp are indicated. Another interesting motif found within the distal part of the promoter was a 31-bp “T-G” pyrimidine-purine repeat (Fig. 4). In summary, over 20 putative response elements or regions of potential relevance to the transcriptional regulation of the tumor Type II hexokinase gene were found, including those for well established regulators of carbohydrate metabolism. To examine the functional activity of the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter in the presence of potential modulators of greatest interest, we placed the 4.3-kbp promoter in the pGL2-Basic reporter vector (Fig. 3C), which is designed to test a promoter's activity by using luciferase as a reporter gene. AS-30D cells were chosen for the transient gene expression study, to ensure the presence of signal transduction cascades and cell-surface receptors characteristic of the parental tumor line. Transient expression of luciferase derived from the promoter-reporter construct was determined after transfection of AS-30D cells, by assaying luciferase activity 24-h post-transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity derived from the co-transfected internal control plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The fold activation of the promoter was based on the activity observed when the transfected cells were maintained in 1 mM pyruvate containing RPMI 1640 medium (control). Under these “background” conditions, and in the presence of 10% serum, the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter supported significant levels of transcription in the same range as that of an SV40 promoter-luciferase construct (pGL2-Control) (data not shown). The relative activity of the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter in driving transcription in the presence of glucose, insulin, or glucagon was then tested. Preliminary studies using a 1 mM lactate or 1 mM pyruvate substrate background indicated that glucose, insulin, and glucagon were capable of directing expression, where the levels of expression observed for each component were similar regardless of the lactate or pyruvate substrate background. Detailed studies using six independent experiments, carried out in a substrate background of 1 mM pyruvate, are shown in Fig. 6. The highest activation of the promoter was observed in the presence of both insulin (100 nM) and glucose (25 mM), with a 4.3-fold increase in activity. Separately, glucose and insulin gave activation levels of 3.4- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Glucagon alone caused a moderate but reproducible activation (1.3-fold) of promoter activity, which increased to 2.4-fold in the presence of glucose. Insulin and glucagon together activated the promoter by 2.8-fold which was 0.4-fold above the transcription enhancement observed in the presence of insulin alone. Finally, the effect of analogs that activate two of the major signal transduction pathways, namely the protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling cascades, on the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter was tested using dibutyryl cAMP (100 μM), an analog of cAMP, and TPA (100 nM), an analog of diacylglycerol, respectively. These analogs increased promoter activity by 2.1- and 3.3-fold, respectively. These findings emphasize the promiscuity of the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter in its activation response to a wide variety of known modulators of carbohydrate metabolism. To test whether the tumor Type II hexokinase promoter was capable of driving transcription in the tumor's parent cell line, the reporter vector was transfected into hepatocytes. The expression was evaluated for glucose, insulin, or glucagon in a substrate background of 1 mM lactate. Parallel expe"

The NADPH-oxidase system of neutrophils is a host-defensive plasma membrane redox system that produces superoxide anion (O)(1Badwey J.A. Karnovsky M.L. Annu. Rev.

A number of studies have provided information about cytochrome b native structure. Electron microscopy and immunochemical analysis were used to localize cytochrome b in the neutrophil and eosinophil(16Jesaitis A.J. Buescher E.S. Harrison D. Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Livesey S. Linner J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Ginsel L.A. Onderwater J.J.M. Fransen J.A.M. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. Blood. 1990; 76: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one of these studies, we found that the epitopes of cytochrome b containing the amino acid residues 547KQSISNSESGPRG559 of gp91phox and 162EARKKPSEEEAAA174 of p22phox are surface-accessible epitopes of native cytochrome b(16Jesaitis A.J.

Nunoi H. Leto T. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that synthetic peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of gp91phoxinhibited NADPH-oxidase activation in electrically permeabilized cells, and antipeptide antibodies directed against this region prevented superoxide formation in a cell-free system. In addition, p22phox contains a proline-rich region in the carboxyl-terminal tail, which may provide Src homology domain binding sites, for p47phox or p47phox/p67phox complexes(19De Mendez I. Garrett M.C. Adams A.G. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16326-16332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest functional roles for the carboxyl termini of both subunits, which are presumed to occupy cytosolic locations. Initial analysis of the folding topology of cytochrome b has been reported by Imajoh-Ohmi et al.(20Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tokita K. Ochiai H. Nakamura M. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who determined accessibility of the subunits to anti-peptide antibodies and proteolytic enzymes. Two regions of gp91phox were exposed to proteolytic enzymes on the outer surface of the cell, while p22phox was not found to be sensitive to such external proteolysis(10Quinn M.T. Mullen M.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl termini of both subunits were accessible to antibody on the internal surface of the plasma membrane(20Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tokita K. Ochiai H. Nakamura M. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 180-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein sequence of the carboxyl-terminal half of gp91phoxshows some similarity to other NAD(P)H-oxidoreductases (12Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Taylor W.R. Jones D.T. Segal A.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) such as ferredoxin NADP reductase, a flavoprotein for which the crystal structure is known. Studies by Pick and co-workers (22Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have shown that cytochrome b binds FAD and can function as a superoxide generating NAD(P)H-oxidase, even without added cytosolic constituents normally required for superoxide production in other cell-free systems (23, 24). These results have prompted speculation that cytochrome b is the only electron transporting component of the NADPH oxidase and that its nucleotide binding domains may resemble ferredoxin reductase (12Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 13Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrase G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or other redox proteins. However, the structural studies by Imajoh-Ohmi et al. suggest that major portions of the putative nucleotide binding domains are extracellular. This contention is also supported by the evidence of Umei et al. (47-49) suggesting that the putative NAD(P)H binding component of the oxidase is present in neutrophils of normal and chronic granulomatous disease patients and is thus not part of cytochrome b. These ambiguities in structure indicate that additional approaches for determining the topology of this protein are required. In this study, we have identified the epitopes bound by two monoclonal antibodies that recognize a specific subunit of cytochrome b using random peptide phage-display libraries. In addition, we present data relating the accessibility of these epitopes on native cytochrome b to their respective antibodies. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Tween 20, SDS, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, ammonium persulfate, TEMED, Hank's solution, FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and Histopaque were purchased from Sigma. Prestained protein molecular weight standards were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Western blots were developed with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin purchased from Bio-Rad, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium chromogen was purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose CL-4B was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Sequencing data were obtained using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Two random phage-display libraries were used in this study. A hexapeptide phage-display library and Escherichia coli strains K91 and MC1061 were kindly provided by Dr. George P. Smith (25Scott J. Smith G. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar) (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO), and a nonapeptide phage-display library was produced in our laboratory. 2J. B. Burritt, F. R. DeLeo, K. W. Doss, M. T. Quinn, C. W. Bond, and A. J. Jesaitis, unpublished data. Affinity purification of phage bearing epitopes bound by mAbs was performed as follows; 5 × 1011 phage (5 μl) from the hexapeptide phage peptide-display library (25Scott J. Smith G. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar) or 1 × 1012 phage (75 μl) from the nonapeptide library were combined with 1.0 ml of Sepharose beads conjugated with 4 mg of either mAb 44.1 or 54.1. The beads were mixed with the phage at 4°C for 16 h by gentle inversion. The mixture was then loaded into a 5-ml plastic column barrel (Evergreen), and unbound phage were removed by washing with 50 ml of phage buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 (v/v), 1 mg/ml BSA). Bound phage were eluted from the column with 2.0 ml of eluting buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 2.2), and the pH of the eluate was neutralized immediately with four drops of 2 M Trizma base(27Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The titer of phage (nonapeptide library) was determined for each column eluate by plaque assay according to standard procedures(28Hackett P. Fuchs J. Messing J. An Introduction to Recombinant DNA Techniques. Addison Wesley, Redding, MA1988Google Scholar). The column matrices were preserved for reuse in second and third round affinity purifications by washing with 10 ml of PBS, pH 7.0, followed by 3.0 ml of PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide. The column was stored at 4°C until the next affinity purification and was prepared for reuse by rinsing with 20 ml of phage buffer prior to mixing with amplified phage. As a control for antibody-specific selection, one column was prepared without antibody bound to the beads; all steps of affinity purification of phage were carried out on this control column, and a sample of the resulting phage was sequenced. Eluate phage were amplified in host K91 “starved” E. coli cells, which were prepared as described previously (27Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 29Tzagloff H. Pratt D. Virology. 1964; 24: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to maximize phage attachment and infection. The entire volume of the first eluate, minus a small amount used for titering, was added to 200 μl of starved K91 cells and incubated 15 min at room temperature without shaking. Two ml of LB broth (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) with tetracycline at 0.2 μg/ml or kanamycin at 0.75 μg/ml (depending on the library used) was added to the cells, which were then incubated with aeration at 37°C for 45 min. The infected cells were spread with a sterile glass rod on the surface of LB agar containing tetracycline (40 μg/ml) or kanamycin (75 μg/ml) in a sterile 9 × 24-inch glass baking dish. After 24-48 h of incubation at 37°C, the antibiotic-resistant colonies were suspended in 25 ml of TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) by gentle scraping with a bent glass rod. Phage were harvested from the culture as described(27Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), and diluted in 1.0 ml of phage buffer and allowed to mix with the column matrix, which was also resuspended in 1 ml of phage buffer. These steps were repeated so that a total of three purifications and two amplifications were used to select and amplify adherent phage from the library. One hundred μl of phage from the final column eluate were used to infect starved K91 cells as described above. Serial 100-fold dilutions of infected cells were used to inoculate LB agar plates containing the appropriate dilution, which were then incubated overnight at 37°C. Isolated colonies were used to inoculate 2 ml of 2 × YT (30Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing the appropriate antibiotic, and the minipreps were incubated overnight at 37°C in a shaking water bath. DNA from the isolated phage was prepared and sequenced according to the directions of the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). An oligonucleotide primer with the sequence 5′-GTT TTG TCG TCT TTC CAG ACG-3′ was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the unique region of the phage, and autoradiographs were viewed using a Molecular Dynamics model 400E PhosphorImager. Some phage bearing hexapeptides of interest (Fig. 2, sequences 3 and 27-29) were propagated by infecting 750 μl of mid-log phase K91 cells with 20 μl of phage supernatant saved from sequencing minipreps. The phage were produced in a method similar to amplifications described above, except the infected cells were grown in 100 ml of 2 × YT with 40 μg/ml tetracycline, and the purified phage were resuspended in 400 μl of TBS. Human neutrophils were purified from citrated blood using Histopaque gradients as described by Boyum(31Boyum A. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-89Google Scholar). Purified cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with 2 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inhibit serine proteases. 5 × 105 cells were used for each sample to determine antibody binding by FACS analysis. Some cell samples were permeabilized on ice for 10 min by adding 500 μl of saponin solution (0.01% saponin, 0.1% gelatin in Dulbecco's PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation as before. Permeabilized cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 80 μl of the primary antibody (usually 50 μg/ml in saponin solution), then washed once with 3.0 ml of saponin solution, centrifuged to collect, and resuspended in 80 μl of the FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:150 in saponin solution, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Permeabilized cells were washed once with 3.0 ml of saponin solution containing propidium iodide at 10 μg/ml, pelleted as before, and resuspended in 500 μl of FACS buffer (Dulbecco's PBS containing 10% rabbit serum). In separate experiments, 100 μl of mAb 44.1 at 10 μg/ml was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with ∼2 × 1010 transducing units (27) phage expressing phage sequence 3 or 27 (Fig. 2) prior to incubation with the saponin-permeabilized cells to determine if the phage-expressed peptide could compete with the natural epitope for binding by the mAb. Control samples in all experiments consisted of cells not incubated with either primary or secondary mAb, cells not incubated with primary mAb, and cells incubated with both an isotype-matched primary mAb and the labeled secondary mAb. Staining of some samples of intact cells was performed as above without treatment with saponin solution. Fluorescence intensity of the FITC-labeled cells was determined on a Becton Dickinson FACScan model FACS analyzer with a 15-milliwatt argon-ion laser using CONSORT 30 and LYSYS software according to the manufacturer's directions. Immunoaffinity-purified phage bearing peptides resembling a region of cytochrome b were isolated and grown as indicated above. Approximately 5 × 1011 purified phage in 20 μl of TBS were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer (3.3% (w/v) SDS, 167 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 33% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.035% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). Heparin-Ultrogel-purified cytochrome b, prepared as described(8Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), was combined with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer without heating. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE at room temperature on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels as described(8Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 10Quinn M.T. Mullen M.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and electrophoretic mobility of sample proteins were compared to prestained protein standards. Following electrophoresis, protein samples were transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously(8Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 44.1 and 54.1 were diluted to 2 μg/ml in diluting buffer (3% (v/v) goat serum, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.1% (w/v) thimerosal in PBS) and incubated with separate regions of the blot for 1 h at room temperature with continuous rocking. The blot was developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate system. Purified cytochrome b (10 μg) was diluted in 100 μl of relax buffer (8Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) containing 50 μg of mAb (44.1, 54.1, irrelevant, or none) and then incubated overnight at 4°C. The pretreated cytochrome b was then loaded onto a 1.36-ml continuous 5-20% sucrose gradient in relax buffer and centrifuged at 53,000 RPM in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor for seven hours at 4°C. The gradient was manually fractionated into 12 120-μl samples from the top. A 20-μl sample of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Cytochrome b was detected by Western blot using a rabbit anti-p22phox polyclonal primary antibody. Western blots were digitized and quantitated using an image analysis system as described(32Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the structure of immunogenic surface regions of cytochrome b and acquire additional information about its membrane topology, monoclonal antibodies were produced against the Triton X-100-solubilized wheat germ agglutinin and heparin-Ultrogel-purified cytochrome b protein(8Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were screened for neutrophil-specific IgG-producing clones that recognized intact or saponin-permeabilized neutrophils and either subunit of heparin-purified cytochrome b. Numerous clones were identified, and two were chosen that recognized either the light or heavy chain of cytochrome b. Epitope mapping of cytochrome b was carried out using these cytochrome b-specific antibodies and phage random peptide-display library technology(25Scott J. Smith G. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 27Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 33Cwirla S. Peters E. Barrett R. Dower W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 34Devlin J. Panganiban L. Devlin P. Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). FACS and immunosedimentation analysis were then used to confirm accessibility of the epitope on native cytochrome b to antibody, and placement of the epitope relative to the plasma membrane. Finally, confirmation of the specificity of the mAb for both the cytochrome b subunit and the phage peptide-bearing pIII protein selected by the mAb was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. To identify the amino acid sequence of the epitopes of cytochrome b recognized by the reactive mAbs, a nonapeptide phage-display library capable of binding to the mAbs was created. Using this library, mAb-binding epitopes were selected from a collection of 5 × 108 unique nine-residue sequences of all 20 amino acids. The epitopes thus mimic the original immunogenic cytochrome b epitope. By sequencing the relevant region of the phage genome, the original cytochrome b epitope was deduced(35Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (abstr.): 121aGoogle Scholar). Confirmation of the epitope selection was achieved using a second epitope library kindly provided by George P. Smith at the University of Missouri, Columbia(27Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Three cycles of immunoaffinity purification and amplification were used to select phage expressing peptides bound by either mAb 44.1 or 54.1. Fig. 1 shows selection and amplification of phage bound by mAb columns. An increase of about 5 logs was observed for the population of binding phage for each mAb, and about 3 logs for phage that interacted with the control column without mAb. The random insert region was sequenced in 34 phage selected by mAb 44.1 from the nonapeptide library and 27 from the hexapeptide library as described under “Materials and Methods.”Fig. 2 shows 33 of the 37 sequences (89%) from the nonapeptide library, which exhibited an obvious consensus pattern matching a region of cytochrome b shown in Fig. 3. This consensus peptide sequence, GGPQVXPI, closely resembles 181GGPQVNPI188 of p22phox (Fig. 3A). The remaining four sequences did not resemble any region of cytochrome b or each other (data not shown). Nineteen of the 27 sequences (70%) from the hexapeptide library showed similarity to the same cytochrome b epitope, and the same nucleotide sequence coding for the PQVRPI peptide was recovered in 17 of the 19 cases. The remaining eight hexapeptide sequences showed no consensus (data not shown). Phage expressing the hexapeptide sequences PQVRPI, FKRGVD, LRRGID, and PKGAYD (Fig. 2; sequences 3 and 27-29, respectively) were isolated and propagated for further study by Western blot and FACS analysis. Phage selected by mAb 54.1 expressed the consensus amino acid sequence PKXAVDGP (the GP is adjacent in the constant pIII region in all phage except phage sequence 34), which is similar to 382PKIAVDGP389 of gp91phox (Fig. 3B). All phage sequenced that were selected from each library by mAb 54.1 suggested a match to this putative gp91phoxepitope. Peptides of phage selected on the column without antibody suggested no match to cytochrome b, or to each other (data not shown). Western blotting analysis was used to show specificity of the mAb for both the cytochrome b subunit and the unique hexapeptide expressed on the phage. As shown in Fig. 4, mAb 54.1 specifically recognized gp91phox (lane A), which migrates between the 68- and 97-kDa molecular size markers, and a 20-kDa proteolytic fragment. The appearance of this 20-kDa immunoreactive fragment can be enhanced in cytochrome b samples treated with V8 protease (10). This mAb also bound to the phage pIII protein expressing the FKRGVD peptide (Fig. 2, sequence 27), which migrates at about 64 kDa (lane C). mAb 54.1 also recognized pIII proteins of phage expressing the LRRGID and PKGAYD peptides (Fig. 2, sequences 28 and 29, respectively) by Western blot with equal intensity (data not shown). Phage expressing the PQVRPI peptide (Fig. 2, sequence 3) was not recognized by mAb 54.1 (lane B), confirming the specificity of mAb 54.1 for the former sequences. As seen in Fig. 4, mAb 44.1 bound to a band migrating at 22 kDa in lane D (p22phox) and a less intense band at 44 kDa (subunit dimer). The pIII protein of phage containing the PQVRPI peptide (Fig. 2, sequence 3) was also recognized by mAb 44.1 (lane F), but not the pIII protein of phage expressing the FKRGVD peptide (Fig. 2, sequence 27) in lane E. The pIII protein migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa. This mobility appears slow, considering the size of the protein is 406 amino acids(36Ebright R. Dong Q. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 114: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, our migration rate compares favorably with other reported PAGE mobilities for this protein (37-40). Binding of mAb 44.1 and 54.1 to both the specific cytochrome b subunit and phage pIII protein confirmed the presence of a similar epitope on each. In addition, mAbs did not bind the pIII protein on phage displaying irrelevant peptides in the random region. Therefore, the sequence of the peptide alone, expressed in the variable region simulates the natural epitope recognized by the mAb. Although the variable peptide of the selected phage may not represent the complete and exact epitope, it clearly contains the residues sufficient for recognition by the mAb. In order to determine the accessibility of the identified epitopes to mAb on native cytochrome b in the cell, FACS analysis was performed on purified leukocytes. While saponin-permeabilized cells stained strongly with mAb 44.1 at 50 μg/ml (Fig. 5, trace B), intact cells show background staining when incubated with either mAb 44.1 (Fig. 5, trace A) or an irrelevant mAb (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W1977640215,"Utilizing site-directed mutagenesis, 77 charged and polar residues that are highly exposed on the surface of human thrombin were systematically substituted with alanine. Functional assays using thrombin mutants identified residues that were required for the recognition and cleavage of the procoagulant substrate fibrinogen (Lys21, Trp50, Lys52, Asn53+Thr55, Lys65, His66, Arg68, Tyr71, Arg73, Lys77, Lys106+Lys107, Asp193+Lys196, Glu202, Glu229, Arg233, Asp234) and the anticoagulant substrate protein C (Lys21, Trp50, Lys65, His66, Arg68, Tyr71, Arg73, Lys77, Lys106+Lys107, Glu229, Arg233), interactions with the cofactor thrombomodulin (Gln24, Arg70) and inhibition by the thrombin aptamer, an oligonucleotide-based thrombin inhibitor (Lys65, His66, Arg70, Tyr71, Arg73). Although there is considerable overlap between the functional epitopes, distinct and specific residues with unique functions were identified. When the functional residues were mapped on the surface of thrombin, they were located on a single hemisphere of thrombin that included both the active site cleft and the highly basic exosite 1. No functional residues were located on the opposite face of thrombin. Residues with procoagulant or anticoagulant functions were not spatially separated but interdigitated with residues of opposite or shared function. Thus thrombin utilizes the same general surface for substrate recognition regardless of substrate function although the critical contact residues may vary."

In this report, we describe a new family of sodium channel ligands, the μO-conotoxins. The two peptides characterized, μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB from Conus marmoreus potently block the sodium conductance in Aplysia neurons. This is in marked contrast to standard sodium channel blockers that are relatively ineffective in this system.

Recent progress in molecular neuroscience has demonstrated that all signaling components in the nervous system are represented by multiple molecular forms (“subtypes”). The identification of different receptor and ion channel subtypes by molecular cloning proceeds at an ever-accelerating rate. In contrast, the structural and functional definition of each subtype has lagged far behind. A major approach to the functional biology of subtypes is to obtain highly subtype-specific ligands that can be used to discriminate between closely related molecular forms. In this respect the conotoxins, peptides found in the venoms of the predatory cone snails, constitute a unique resource. For incidental biological reasons, it appears that these peptides are under strong selection to be unusually subtype-specific. Several Conus peptide families which our laboratories have developed are already being used to discriminate between closely related subtypes. For example, in the calcium channel field, the ω-conotoxins have provided the means for discriminating between various channel subtypes that play a role in neurotransmitter release (see Ref. 1 for review). Conus peptides that target voltage-sensitive sodium channels have also been described. The best characterized of these are the μ-conotoxins, which selectively target vertebrate skeletal muscle subtypes of voltage-sensitive sodium channels(2Ohizumi Y. Minoshima S. Takahashi M. Kajiwara A. Nakamura H. Kobayashi J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 239: 243-248PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cruz L.J. Kupryszewski G. LeCheminant G.W. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Rivier J.

Science. 1990; 249: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). A review of the present state of knowledge regarding the functional role of the various sodium channel subtypes (5Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. Suppl. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref Google Scholar) makes it clear that it is desirable to develop other highly specific ligands for this group of channel proteins. In this paper, we describe the isolation, characterization, and synthesis of novel peptides, μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB, from the venom of the snail-hunting species Conus marmoreus (Fig. 1). Although these peptides produce a biological effect which is similar to that of the μ-conotoxins, they are unrelated structurally. Thus, the μO-conotoxins define a new family of peptides which block Na+ currents of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. The discovery of this novel family provides a new opportunity to obtain a large armamentarium of subtype-specific sodium channel-targeted Conus peptides. Crude venom from dissected ducts of C. marmoreus was collected in the Philippines, lyophilized, and stored at −70°C until use. Lyophilized crude venom (500 mg) was extracted(6McIntosh J.M. Foderaro T.A. Li W. Ireland C.M. Olivera B.M. Toxicon. 1993; 32: 1561-1566Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), placed in a Centriprep 30 microconcentrator, and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 8 h at 4°C. Filtrate was purified on a C18 Vydac column (22 × 250 mm) using a gradient system. Buffer A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and buffer B = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile. The gradient was 0-15% buffer B/15 min, then 15-39% buffer B/72 min, then 39-65% buffer B/15 min, then 65-100% buffer B/5 min and held at 100% buffer B for 10 min. Flow rate was 10 ml/min. For subsequent purification steps Vydac C8 columns (10 × 250 mm, or 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size) were used with buffer A as above and buffer B = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile. The gradient was 5-55% buffer B/15 min, followed by 55-70% buffer B/45 min. Flow rate was 5 ml/min for the semipreparative column and 1 ml/min for the analytical column. Absorbance was monitored at 220 and 280 nm. Peptides from the final purification were reduced and pyridylethylated by previously described methods(7McIntosh J.M. Yoshikami D. Mahe E. Nielsen D.B. Rivier J.E. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16733-16739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alkylated peptides were then purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Sequencing was performed with Edman chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer at the Protein/DNA Core Facility at the University of Utah Cancer Center. Mass spectra were measured with a Jeol JMS-HX110 double focusing spectrometer fitted with a Cs+ gun. Synthesis was carried out by the strategy developed for ω-conotoxin MVIID(8Monje V.D. Haack J. Naisbitt S. Miljanich G. Ramachandran J. Nasdasdi L. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry was used, with single couplings using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and hydroxybenzotriazole. All amino acid derivatives were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and were loaded into cartridges for use in an ABI model 430A peptide synthesizer. Side chain protection used was t-butoxycarbonyl (Lys), t-butyl (Glu, Tyr, Ser), and pentamethylchromansulfonyl (Arg). Cysteine was protected as S-trityl (residues 2, 19, 20, 30) and S-acetamidomethyl (residues 9 and 25). Cleavage from the resin and subsequent workup followed essentially the same procedures as for conotoxin GmVIA(9Shon K.-J. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11420-11425Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone encoding μO-conotoxin MrVIB was identified from a size-fractionated cDNA library constructed from C. marmoreus venom duct mRNA as described previously(10Colledge C.J. Hunsperger J.P. Imperial J.S. Hillyard D.R. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The clones were identified by colony hybridization screening the C. marmoreus cDNA library using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the signal sequence of Conus peptides belonging to the O-superfamily. The oligonucleotide probe with the sequence 5′ ATG AAA CTG ACG TGC ATG ATG 3′ was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Hybridization was carried out using duplicate nylon filters (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) to which colonies of the C. marmoreus cDNA library were bound for 16 h at 42°C using standard hybridization conditions (5 × Denhardt's solution, 6 × NET (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris, (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The filters were washed at 51°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and positive colonies were identified by autoradiography. A second round of screening was carried out on 50 putative clones that were radiolabeled in the first round of colony hybridization. Clones which were positive in both screening rounds were sequenced. Plasmid DNA (5 μg) was prepared for sequencing by adding 0.1 volume of 2 M NaOH, 2 mM EDTA at 37°C for 30 min (thereby denaturing the DNA), and the mixture was then neutralized with 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5). DNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, pelleted, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in distilled H2O (7 μl). Sequenase reaction buffer (2 μl) and the oligonucleotide indicated above (1 μl) were added, the mixture heated to 65°C for 5 min and cooled to 30°C to allow annealing of the oligonucleotide. One DNA strand from each clone was then sequenced using the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit and 35S-dATP (Sequenase version 2.0 seventh edition protocol). The MrVIB sequence was found in four independent clones. RB neurons from the abdominal ganglion of the sea hare Aplysia oculifera collected in the Gulf of Eilat or Aplysia californica shipped from the University of Miami (Aplysia Resource Facility) were isolated and grown in culture(11Spira M.E. Benbassat D. Dormann A. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 300-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Spira M.E. Hasson A. Fainzilber M. Gordon D. Zlotkin E. Isr. J. Med.

The neurons were cultured at very low densities of three to five cells per culture dish, to prevent synaptic interactions between them. Experiments were performed on neurons 1-4 days in culture. Analysis of the toxin action was carried out using both intracellular current clamp recording and stimulation as well as whole-cell patch clamp techniques(14Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15142) Google Scholar). For the intracellular current clamp experiments a micro-electrode was inserted into the cell body. This electrode was used for both current injection and voltage recordings. An EPC-9 computerized amplifier (Heka Electronics, Lembracht, Germany) was used to record from neurons in the whole cell patch configuration. Patch pipettes had a typical resistance of 1-1.5 megaohms. The series resistance never exceeded 2.5 megaohms and was stable throughout the experiments. The series resistance was compensated by 70-90%. Experiments in which voltage-current relationship was monitored were carried out only when the series resistance was less than 2.5 megaohms. Thus, the maximal voltage error in these experiments was smaller than 3 mV. Leak and capacitance currents were subtracted. To achieve adequate space clamp, the large axon of the neuron was trimmed off about 30 min prior to the experiment (11, 15). The experiments were carried out at room temperature ranging between 20-24°C. 20-100 μl of toxin solution were applied to the experimental dish (0.25-0.75 ml) using a Gilson tip pipette placed a few millimeters away from the neuron under study. The indicated toxin concentrations correspond to the final concentration in the experimental dish. Control experiments were carried out in artificial sea water composed of: 460 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 11 mM CaCl2, 55 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.6. To minimize potassium currents we used an external potassium channel-blocking solution, in which KCl was substitute for by CsCl. In addition, the solution contained 50 mM tetraethylammonium chloride and 0.1 mM 3,4-diaminopyridine. The osmolarity of the solution was adjusted by reducing the NaCl concentration to 410 mM. To monitor sodium current, a calcium-free potassium channel-blocking solution was used. In this solution, Ca2+ was substituted for by Mg2+, and the solution was supplemented by 8 mM Co2+ to prevent any Ca2+ influx. For these experiments the patch pipette contained 440 mM CsCl, 40 mM CsOH, 20 mM NaCl, 6.8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 100 mM HEPES, and 3 mM adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). The pH was adjusted to 7.3. To monitor calcium currents the external sodium ions were replaced by tetraethylammonium chloride. The patch pipette contained 440 mM CsCl, 40 mM CsOH, 2 mM CaCl, 6.8 mM MgCl2, 100 mM HEPES, 10 mM Cs4BAPTA1 1The abbreviations used are: BAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidRPLCreversed phase liquid chromatography. (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 5.6 mM glucose. In order to prevent run-down of calcium channels(16Fox A.P. Nowycky M.C. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), the internal solution was supplemented with 0.5 mM guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) and “ATP-regenerating system,” 10 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate (Sigma) and 50 units/ml of phosphocreatine kinase (Sigma). In those conditions, run-down of calcium current was less than 10% per hour. The pH was adjusted to 7.3. 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid reversed phase liquid chromatography. To simultaneously monitor calcium and sodium currents, the experiments were carried out in potassium channel-blocking solution, and the patch pipette contained the same internal solution used for calcium current monitoring supplemented by 20 mM NaCl. Potassium-containing external and internal solutions were used when outward currents were under study. Sodium currents were eliminated by replacing the sodium ions with Trizma 7.4 (Sigma). In these experiments the patch pipette contained 480 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 6.8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, and 100 mM HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.3. Here, and throughout the manuscript the “±” stands for standard error of the mean. We screened venom fractions from C. marmoreus for potential high affinity blockers of the tetrodotoxin-insensitive inward sodium current which underlies the generation of propagating action potentials in cultured Aplysia neurons. Two strongly hydrophobic fractions of this venom potently abolished the sodium component of the action potential. The active fractions were purified to homogeneity as is shown in Fig. 2. The purified components were analyzed by amino acid sequencing as described under “Experimental Procedures,” revealing two novel peptides, μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB. Their sequences are as follows. μO-conotoxin MrVIA: ACRKKWEYCIVPIIGFIYCCPGLICGPFVCVμO-conotoxin MrVIB: ACSKKWEYCIVPILGFVYCCPGLICGPFVCV Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry indicated that Cys residues are present as disulfides and that the COOH-terminal α-carboxyl group is the free acid for both peptides (monoisotopic MH+: MrVIA calculated 3487.66, observed 3487.8; MrVIB calculated 3404.58, observed 3404.8). The sequence was further verified by chemical synthesis and cDNA cloning (see below). Surprisingly, the new conotoxins show no detectable amino acid sequence homology to the well characterized sodium channel blocking peptides from Conus venoms, the μ-conotoxins from fish-hunting Conus snails. Instead, the cysteine pattern resembles that of the ω-conotoxins, the large family of Conus peptides which are specifically targeted to calcium channels and of the Δ-conotoxins that slow down the inactivation rate of sodium channels (1, 4, 9, 18-21). Solid-phase chemical synthesis of μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB was undertaken by the two-stage strategy of Monje et al.(8Monje V.D. Haack J. Naisbitt S. Miljanich G. Ramachandran J. Nasdasdi L. Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), as modified for the hydrophobic Δ-conotoxins TxVIA and GmVIA(9Shon K.-J. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11420-11425Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). On the assumption that the disulfide bridging would be conserved, Cys9 and Cys25 were protected as the stable Cys(S-acetamidomethyl), whereas the other four Cys residues were protected as the acid-labile Cys(S-trityl). After cleavage from the resin, the linear peptide was purified by RPLC, and then oxidized to a mixture of three bicyclic peptides. Trial experiments indicated which of these corresponded to the correct isomer, and the main batch of peptide was subjected to further oxidation by iodine in 10% trifluoroacetic acid. After destroying excess iodine with ascorbic acid, the tricyclic peptide was purified by RPLC (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid with an acetonitrile gradient of 32-68% in 40 min). Synthetic peptide was shown to co-elute with the natural material and was equipotent in biological assays. In order to determine the precursor sequence of these peptides, a cDNA library was prepared from venom ducts of Conus marmoreus and clones related to the new peptides were identified. Two cDNA clones for μO-conotoxin MrVIB were characterized. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the encoded precursor is shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that the last 31 residues exactly match the experimentally determined sequence of μO-conotoxin MrVIB. The putative 82-amino acid precursor sequence is presumably cleaved after Arg-51 to yield the mature 31-amino acid peptide. The cDNA sequence also verifies the biochemical assignment for a free carboxyl terminus for MrVIB. Action potentials generated by intracellular stimulation of cultured Aplysia neurons were rapidly (30 s) blocked by bath application of 350 nM conotoxin MrVIA (Fig. 4, A and B). The action potential blockade was not associated with changes in the transmembrane potential or input resistance. An increase in the intracellular stimulus intensity failed to evoke a full-blown action potential, but induced a small local response (not shown). The local response was most likely generated by unblocked voltage-gated calcium channels, as it could be abolished by the addition of 8 mM cobalt ions to the bath solution (see also Fig. 5A).Figure 5:Effect of MrVIA on the sodium and calcium current. For the experiment the potassium currents were blocked. The neuron was depolarized from a holding potential of −50 to 20 mV. In the control (A), the depolarization induced an early rapidly inactivating sodium current and a plateau of calcium current. Application of 150 nM MrVIA rapidly blocked the early sodium current (second trace in A and see inset). The rate at which INa+ was blocked is shown by the open diamonds in D. Note that the calcium current was not affected by 150 nM MrVIA (A and black circles in D). Following the application of 3.5 μM MrVIA, ICa2+ was gradually reduced (B and black circles in D). ICa2+ rapidly recovered following wash by artificial sea water, whereas the sodium current remained blocked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the mechanisms underlying the action potential blockage by μO-conotoxins MrVIA/B, we used experimental protocols that permitted us to examine the isolated macroscopic currents of either K+, Ca2+, or Na+. The toxins had no effects on the voltage-gated potassium currents at concentrations of up to 10 μM. To examine the effects of μO-conotoxins MrVIA/B on the sodium current we carried out a series of experiments (n = 6 for MrVIA and n = 3 for MrVIB) in which the potassium and calcium currents were eliminated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The voltage clamp records of Fig. 4B and 5A show that 150-250 nM MrVIA completely blocks the inward sodium current within 30 s after toxin application. The blockade of INa+ was not associated with changes in the rise time or decay time kinetics of the macroscopic current as evidenced by the fact that the normalized control INa+ and partially toxin-blocked INa+ superimpose on each other with no deviation. The blockade of INa+ is not associated with a change in the currentvoltage relations (Fig. 4C), nor by a change in the steady state inactivation or activation curves (data not shown). Complete blockade of INa+ occurs at MrVIA concentration of 250 nM. At this concentration the toxin had no detectable effects on the calcium currents. A preliminary report of a MrVIA homolog which blocked Lymnaea calcium currents at high concentrations (22) prompted us to test high concentrations of MrVIA in Aplysia. At these toxin concentrations (>2 μM) MrVIA reduced the inward calcium current. This is illustrated by the experiment of Fig. 5, in which the potassium current was blocked (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the neuron was depolarized from a holding potential of -50 mV to 20 mY. Under these conditions the inward current is composed of two peaks. The first is the inward sodium current with fast activation and inactivation kinetics. The second is the calcium current. Its peak is somewhat delayed and is characterized by slow inactivation kinetics (20). Application of 150 nMMrVIA induced a rapid block of the early sodium current (Fig. 5, A, and D, diamonds) but had no effect on the calcium current (Fig. 5, A and D). Following the application of 3.5 μM MrVIA to the bathing solution the amplitude of ICa2+ was gradually reduced (Fig. 5, B and D) reaching a 60% blockade of ICa2+ approximately 4 min after toxin application. Complete blockade of ICa2+ was reached at MrVIA concentrations of approximately 100 μM (data not shown). Unlike the blockade of INa+ that did not recover even after prolonged washing (45 min) (Fig. 5D), the blockade of the calcium current recovered to the control level within a few seconds of wash (Fig. 5, C and D). The high MrVIA concentration necessary to induce the blockade of ICa2+, the slow blocking rate, and the rapid washout of the blockade suggest that this blockade of calcium conductance by MrVIA is unlikely to play a major role in prey immobilization by C. marmoreus. Since 250 nM MrVIA is sufficient to completely block INa+, a concentration that does not affect ICa2+, μO-conotoxin MrVIA can be used effectively as a sodium channel blocking agent in neurobiological studies of the Aplysia nervous system. The results above demonstrate that μO-conotoxins purified from the venom of a mollusc-hunting Conus potently block voltage-sensitive sodium channels in molluscan systems. The activity of μO-conotoxin MrVIA was also examined using injections into mice; results are shown in Table I. The data reveal that the peptide is extremely potent when injected into the rodent central nervous system. Dramatic symptomatology is observed (ataxia, coma), even upon injection of doses of MrVIA as low as 0.1 nmol. In contrast, no effects are observed at doses up to 100 × greater when the toxin is injected intraperitoneally.Table I:Bioassay μO-conotoxin MrVIA Open table in a new tab The results described above establish that two peptides from C. marmoreus venom, μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB potently block the inward Na+ current of cultured Aplysia neurons. As will be discussed below, the μO-conotoxins show great potential as general pharmacological tools for discriminating among sodium channel subtypes, and together with the ω- and Δ-conotoxins, define a “superfamily” of Conus peptides. We also comment on the probable biological role of these peptides. The central nervous system of Aplysia is extensively used for the study of various neurobiological questions, yet no efficient sodium channel blocking agents are presently available. The classical sodium channel blockers, tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin, are inefficient in Aplysia neurons. For example, tetrodotoxin blocks Aplysia sodium channels at concentrations of 100-200 μM, 3-4 orders of magnitude higher concentration than those required to block sodium channels in vertebrate brain, in vertebrate muscles and even the less sensitive channels in cardiac and denervated muscles(5Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. Suppl. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref Google Scholar, 23Geduldig D. Jung D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1968; 199: 347-365Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

Wang G.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 237-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the new μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB block sodium current in Aplysia channels at submicromolar concentrations. They should thus provide useful tools for Aplysia neurobiological studies and probes for molecular biological analysis of molluscan sodium channels in general. Surprisingly, although the new conotoxins clearly block Na+ currents elicited through voltage-sensitive sodium channels, they show no detectable amino acid sequence identity to the μ-conotoxins from fish-hunting Conus, the other group of Conus peptides that block sodium currents. Instead, the MrVIA/B peptides have a cysteine pattern similar to that of the ω-conotoxins from fish-hunting snails and the Δ-conotoxins from mollusc-hunting snails. An examination of the precursor sequence of the MrVIB peptide reveals considerable homology not only to the ω-conotoxin family, but to the Δ-conotoxins which slow down the inactivation rate of sodium channels (9, 19-21). In fact there is greater similarity between the new conotoxin and the Δ-conotoxins (35 out of 51 residues identical in the prepro region) than there is to the ω-conotoxins (24 out of 51 residues identical). A comparison of the predicted precursor sequences of these peptides, deduced from cDNA clones, is shown in Fig. 6. The boxes indicate sequence identities. Thus, three distinctive pharmacological groups of Conus peptides appear to belong to the same structural group, which we will define as the “O-superfamily” of Conus peptides: the ω-conotoxins which inhibit calcium channels, the Δ-conotoxins which slow down the inactivation rate of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, and the μO-conotoxins which block voltage-sensitive sodium currents. By contrast, the μ-conotoxins from fish-hunting Conus, which show the same general physiological mechanism as the μO-conotoxins (i.e. blockage of voltage-sensitive sodium currents), have no detectable homology to any of the peptides in Fig. 6. They clearly belong to a different Conus peptide superfamily. By definition, the O-superfamily comprises those peptides with strong similarity to the omega-conotoxins in their precursor sequences; a curious feature is that the signal sequences region is the most highly conserved. Thus, the work described above suggests that in this single genus there has been functional convergence of peptides from two different superfamilies to produce toxins that inhibit sodium channel function, but functional divergence within a single superfamily to produce functionally distinct toxin families. Such an extreme interspecific diversification of venom peptides may account in part for the unusual proliferation of species in the genus Conus, which is presently believed to be the largest living genus of marine invertebrates (approximately 500 living species)(27Walls J.G. Cone Shells: A Synopsis of Living Conidae. T. F. H. Publications, Inc., Ltd., Hong Kong/Singapore1979Google Scholar). Our results suggest that snail-hunting Conus have evolved at least two solutions to the same biological problem of feeding on snails. When harpooned, the prey would naturally retract into their shells to escape from a predatory Conus snail. Our observations of feeding in aquaria suggest that two snail-hunting Conus groups have generated very different ways to prevent prey from becoming paralyzed inside the shell. Conus textile, after envenomating a snail (such as the Kelletia species), induces convulsive contractures, with the victim moving into and out of the shell. In contrast, envenomation by C. marmoreus elicits a slow relaxation. Purified Δ-conotoxin TxVIA induces the convulsive contractures in snails observed with whole C. textile venom, whereas μO-conotoxin MrVIA causes the flaccid relaxation characteristic of crude C. marmoreus venom. In either case, access to the prey is ensured by the cone snail after immobilization of the victim, albeit by very different means. μO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB are harbingers of a potentially much wider range of peptides active against sodium channels. The availability of the cloned precursor sequence has allowed us to identify potential homologs from venoms of other Conus species.2 2M. Marsh and D. Hillyard, unpublished results. The sequences available suggest that there is considerable sequence hypervariability in this family of Conus peptides, making it likely that different members may have differing sodium channel subtype specificity profiles. Similarly, although the structurally unrelated μ-conotoxins have only been characterized from a single fish-hunting Conus species, Conus geographus, a molecular genetic analysis has revealed that a number of other fish-hunting Conus species also have μ-conotoxins; the predicted peptides are presently being synthesized and will be further characterized. In vivo results already suggest that the first peptides characterized from these two conotoxin families (μ and μO) may have distinctly different sodium channel subtype specificity in mammalian systems. Thus, relatively high doses of μO-conotoxin MrVIA (>10 nmol/10 g) are inactive peripherally in rodents, whereas μ-conotoxin GIIIB is a potent paralytic when injected intraperitoneal(28Cruz L.J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 9280-9288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this is consistent with the well established specificity of μ-conotoxins for voltage-sensitive sodium channels from mammalian skeletal muscle. In contrast, low doses of μO-conotoxin MrVIA cause ataxia and/or reversible coma in a few minutes when injected intracranially, whereas no detectable symptoms are observed after several hours of a similar central injection of μ-conotoxin GIIIB. These results suggest that MrVIA is a potent ligand in the mammalian central nervous system and may target central sodium channels. In contrast, GIIIB targets the skeletal muscle subtype with high affinity, but not neuronal sodium channels. We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that the differing effects between these toxins are due to differences in state-dependent channel block, rates of absorption, or susceptibility to proteolysis. Preliminary experiments with cloned sodium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes are, however, consistent with the in vivo central effects of μO-conotoxins.3 3H. Terlau, B. M. Olivera, and W. Stühmer, unpublished results. Many more members of the μ- and μ0-conotoxin families can be identified by molecular genetic techniques and the predicted peptides chemically synthesized. By screening for those peptides that induce different in vivo symptoms, an expanding set of promising ligands for establishing a subtype-specific pharmacology for sodium channels should be established. Different ion channel subtypes might be expected to play distinctive functional roles in nervous systems. For voltage-sensitive calcium channels, this functional differentiation of subtypes has become increasingly well documented. This has been made possible in large part by the availability of a family of Conus peptides, the ω-conotoxins: thus, α1B- and α1A-containing calcium channel complexes are differentially targeted by different ω-conotoxins(1Olivera B.M. Miljanich G. Ramachandran J. Adams M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 823-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The functional differentiation of sodium channel subtypes is much more poorly understood; the paucity of sodium channel subtype-specific ligands is a major reason for this situation. This report describes a new family of Conus peptides, the μO-conotoxins, which potently block voltage-sensitive sodium currents. The μO-conotoxins are potentially as important to sodium channel subtype differentiation as the ω-conotoxins are to calcium channels. Toxin was injected intracranially (i.c.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) into young (5-8 g) mice (29). NE, no effect; NT, not tested. Mass spectrometry was performed by A. G.

https://openalex.org/W1970747388,"The angiotensin II type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R) receptors belong to the seven transmembrane receptor superfamily. Previous studies have suggested that the AT1R couples to a Gq signaling pathway, whereas the AT2R does not associate with Gq. To identify the role that individual intracellular domains play in AT1R function, AT1R/AT2R chimeric receptors were prepared by substitution of intracellular loops. CHO cells expressing these chimeras were used to test angiotensin II-induced c-fos expression and Ca2+ mobilization which are involved in the AT1R signaling pathway through Gq coupling. Substitution of the second intracellular loop (IC2) and the cytoplasmic tail between the two receptors did not affect AT1R function. However, exchange of the third intracellular loop (IC3) resulted in the loss of function in the AT1R and conferred to the AT2R the ability to constitutively activate the fos promoter. These findings suggest that the third intracellular loop of the AT1R is critical for Gq coupling. Substitution of discrete amino acid sequences of the third intracellular loop indicate that its N-terminal and C-terminal portions, especially the seven amino acids 219-225 in the N-terminal portion, are important for AT1R function, and that the intermediate portion of this loop is not required for Gq coupling."

Thus, the arterivirus Nsp2 protease is an unusual Cys protease with amino acid sequence similarities to both papain-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases. Proteolytic processing of viral proteins fulfills a key role in the life cycle of the majority of viruses(1Kräusslich H.G. Wimmer E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 2Strauss E.G. Strauss J.H. Semin. Virol. 1990; 1: 347-356Google Scholar, 3Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Positive-stranded RNA viruses usually synthesize polyproteins composed of structural and/or replicative subunits. The processing of nonstructural precursors is almost exclusively conducted by specific virus-encoded proteases. The majority of these enzymes are assumed to be distant relatives of papain-like or chymotrypsin-like cellular proteases(4Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Sov. Sci. Rev. D. Physicochem. Biol. 1993; 11: 1-84Google Scholar). Between positive-stranded RNA viral and cellular papain-like proteases the only conserved residues appear to be: a catalytic Cys, followed by a bulky hydrophobic residue (usually Trp), and a more downstream catalytic His(5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The distance between Cys and His tends to be smaller and more variable in viral papain-like proteases. It remains to be determined whether viral and cellular papain-like proteases are structurally similar. Only a fraction of the viral chymotrypsin-like proteases contains the “canonical” catalytic triad of Ser, His, and Asp, which is found in cellular chymotrypsin-like enzymes(6Bazan J.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Several viral chymotrypsin-like proteases employ an active site Cys instead of Ser or a Glu instead of Asp(8Bazan J.F. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was argued that viral chymotrypsin-like Cys proteases (also known as picornavirus 3C-like Cys proteases) might be direct descendants of an ancestral chymotrypsin-like protease(10Brenner S.

It is now clear that, within the common framework of the two β-barrel domain fold, the divergent evolution of catalytic systems and structures of positive-stranded RNA virus proteases has generated a set of unique proteolytic enzymes. Both papain-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases are involved in the replication cycle of arteriviruses, a newly recognized group of animal positive-stranded RNA viruses(15Plagemann P.G.W. Moennig V. Adv. Virus Res. 1991; 41: 99-192Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The genome structure of three closely related arteriviruses, equine arteritis virus (EAV; Ref. 16),1 1The abbreviations used are: EAVequine arteritis virusCPcysteine proteaseNspnonstructural proteinLDVlactate dehydrogenase-elevating virusORFopen reading framePCPpapain-like cysteine proteasePRRSVporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virusaaamino acid(s). porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; Ref. 17), and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV; Ref. 18), was determined recently. The 5′ three-quarters of the 12.7-kilobase genome of EAV, the arterivirus prototype, contain two open reading frames (ORFs), which encode replicative proteins. The ORF1a product is 1727 amino acids (aa) long. ORF1b is expressed through ribosomal frameshifting which generates a 3175-aa ORF1ab fusion protein (16). In infected cells and expression systems, the ORF1a polyprotein is cleaved at least five times, yielding nonstructural proteins (Nsp) 1 through 6 (Fig. 1; Ref. 19). A papain-like Cys protease (PCP) in EAV Nsp1 cleaves the Nsp1/2 junction(20Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7040-7048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A chymotrypsin-like Ser protease was identified in the arterivirus Nsp4 protein (16Den Boon J.A. Snijder E.J. Chirnside E.D. de Vries A.A.F. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.M. J.

Instead, a Cys protease in the N-terminal domain of Nsp2 was shown to be involved in this process.

Protein sequences were compared with the nonredundant database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnological Information and the SwissProt data base using the BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Gish W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11535) Google Scholar). An improved version of the profile analysis (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 19-29PubMed Google Scholar) was employed for comparison of profiles with other profiles and sequences. Recombinant plasmids were constructed using standard techniques. Expression vector pM1a, a pBS¯ (Stratagene) derivative, contained the complete EAV ORF1a sequence downstream of a T7 promoter, a copy of the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site, which was used to enhance translation(31Jang S.K. Kräusslich H.G. Nicklin M.J.H. Duke G.M. Palmenberg A.C. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2636-2643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 12 nt encoding the N-terminal extension Met-Ala-Thr-Thr(19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ORF1a sequence in pM1a was modified to facilitate mutagenesis; translationally silent mutations were introduced to create unique restriction sites. A detailed description of pM1a will be published elsewhere. The new restriction sites used here were NcoI (nt 224, containing the ORF1a initiation codon) and SphI (nt 1975). Constructs pMX6 and pMX8 (Fig. 1) were derived from pM1a by insertion of a termination codon into SalI (nt 2608) and ApaI (nt 3688) restriction sites, respectively. To create pMΔ (Fig. 1), two deletions were made in pM1a. First, a translation initiation codon was engineered close to the Nsp1/2 border and the Nsp1-encoding sequence was deleted. The N-terminal sequence of the pMΔ protein was Met-Ala-Thr-Thr-Met-Val/Gly-261. The second deletion comprised the sequence encoding Nsp4 and a part of Nsp5. To this end, SmaI restriction sites were generated at nt 3415 and nt 4513 and an in-frame SmaI deletion was made. The Nsp2 deletion mutants (Fig. 3) were created by digestion of pairs of unique pMΔ restriction sites and subsequent religation. The following sites were used: NcoI (nt 997), HindIII (nt 1501), KpnI (nt 1802), SphI (nt 1875), ClaI (nt 2296), and SalI (nt 2608). Bicistronic construct pBC (Fig. 4) was generated by insertion of the following sequence elements into the pMΔ HindIII site at nt 1501: a termination codon for the first cistron, a second encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site, and an NcoI site containing the initiation codon for the second cistron.Figure 4:Construction and expression of bicistronic construct pBC. The putative Nsp2 CP (pBC protease) and its substrate (pBC precursor) were expressed as two separate proteins and immunoprecipitated using the anti-Nsp2 (α2) and anti-Nsp5 (α5) sera (19). The results obtained with pMΔ and control constructs expressing either the first (pMΔX3) or the second (pMΔ(d261-426)) cistron are shown. The N- and C-terminal pBC cleavage products, which are indicative of processing of the Nsp2/3 site in the precursor, are indicated.

After complete sequence analysis, restriction fragments carrying mutations were transferred back to pM1a or pM1a-derived vectors. Transient T7 expression using vaccinia virus recombinant vTF7-3(33Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled from 4 to 7 h postinfection using [35S]methionine. The α2 and α5 antisera, and the methods for cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have been described previously(19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When full-length EAV ORF1a construct pM1a was expressed, the 61-kDa Nsp2 protein was detected (Fig. 1), indicating that the Nsp2/3 junction was cleaved efficiently. The slightly smaller size (58-kDa; Fig. 1) of the pMX6 product indicated that the Nsp2/3 cleavage site is located approximately 30 aa downstream of Val-795. Cleavage at this site was observed with truncated constructs pMΔ and pMX8 (Fig. 1). The 120-kDa pMΔ product lacked both the Nsp1 and Nsp4 protease domains, indicating that the Nsp2/3 site was cleaved by a third protease. The Nsp56 region could be excluded as the possible location of this new protease, since it was absent from the pMX8 product. The pMΔ construct was used for a more detailed experimental analysis of the processing of the Nsp2/3 site (see below). Its N-terminal cleavage product (62 kDa) consists of Nsp2 and a six-residue N-terminal extension. Its C-terminal cleavage product, which was estimated at 58 kDa but consistently migrated in the 50-kDa region of our gels, was comprised of Nsp3 and the C-terminal 297 residues of the ORF1a protein. With a few exceptions, positive-stranded RNA viral nonstructural polyproteins are processed by virus-encoded proteases. Hence, we assumed that the protease which cleaves the EAV Nsp2/3 site resided in Nsp2 or Nsp3. Comparison of arterivirus Nsp2 and Nsp3 sequences with sequence data bases did not produce any significant matches. Assuming that the unknown protease could be conserved among arteriviruses, we scanned the EAV, LDV, and PRRSV sequences for conserved residues that might be involved in proteolytic catalysis (Ser, Cys, His, Asp, Glu, or Asp/Glu). Our computer analysis showed that the arrangement of the conserved Cys-270 and His-332 residues (Fig. 2A) in the N-terminal Nsp2 domain resembles the catalytic dyad of papain-like proteases of arteriviruses and other positive-stranded RNA viruses. The sequences surrounding the LDV/PRRSV counterpart of EAV Cys-270 produced a match with the region around the catalytic Cys-164 of the EAV Nsp1 papain-like protease (PCP; Fig. 2B). A close inspection of the Cys-270 region revealed that it also resembles the context of the catalytic nucleophile of chymotrypsin-like Cys proteases (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, it was noticed that His-332 is the only conserved His residue in the sequences of Nsp2 and Nsp3. This type of residue fulfills a catalytic role in cysteine, serine, and metalloproteases(34Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Its presence was an additional indication for a possible proteolytic function of the Nsp2 N-terminal domain. Therefore, we speculated that Cys-270 and His-332 form the catalytic dyad of an unusual type of Cys protease (CP), which mediates the Nsp2/3 cleavage. Four domains could be discriminated in arterivirus Nsp2 proteins. The N- and C-terminal regions (about 100 and 200 aa, respectively) are highly conserved and rich in Cys residues. A 130-aa hydrophobic domain precedes the conserved C-terminal region. The remaining part of Nsp2 is hydrophilic and extremely variable, both in size (160-600 aa) and in sequence(18Godeny E.K. Chen L. Kumar S.N. Methven S.L. Koonin E.V. Brinton M.A. Virology. 1993; 194: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the involvement of the putative Nsp2 CP domain in the Nsp2/3 cleavage, we deleted the sequence encoding the Nsp2 N-terminal region from construct pMΔ (Fig. 3, deletion A). As expected, processing of the Nsp2/3 site was completely abolished. In addition to the pMΔ precursor protein, an indistinct band in the 90-kDa region was observed. Similar bands were also seen when some of the other pMΔ deletion mutants were expressed. Their origin is unclear, although there appears to be a correlation between their size and the size of the corresponding precursor protein. Subsequently, we deleted part of the Nsp2 sequence which separates the putative CP and its cleavage site (Fig. 3, deletions B and C). Also these deletions inhibited proteolysis, since the 58-kDa C-terminal cleavage product was not produced in detectable amounts. Even smaller deletions in the hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and C-terminal Cys-rich Nsp2 regions (Fig. 3, deletions D, E, and F) were not tolerated, suggesting that an intact Nsp2 is required for processing of the Nsp2/3 site. Again some of the constructs yielded some unexplained minor bands (e.g. two bands in the 55-60-kDa region in the case of deletion B; Fig. 3), which we assume to be unrelated to the processing of the Nsp2/3 junction. To test trans-cleavage activity, the putative Nsp2 CP and the rest of the pMΔ protein were separately expressed from bicistronic construct pBC (Fig. 4). The product of the first cistron, containing the N-terminal 165 aa of Nsp2, was seen as a double band of approximately 18 kDa. This doublet is explained by the presence of two translation initiation codons, separated by 9 nt, at the 5′ end of the ORF(35Kaminski A. Howell M.T. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3753-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A substantial part of the pBC substrate encoded by the second cistron was cleaved, apparently at the authentic Nsp2/3 site (Fig. 4). This showed that the N-terminal Nsp2 domain can induce processing in trans. When Cys-270 or His-332 were mutated, processing was completely abolished. The same result was obtained when the central and/or C-terminal domains of Nsp2 were deleted from the substrate (Fig. 4). To characterize the putative CP in more detail, 30 substitutions at 12 different positions in the Nsp2 N-terminal region were tested (Fig. 5). Substitution of Cys-270 and His-332, the putative catalytic residues, abolished proteolytic activity. This was also the case when three other conserved Cys residues (aa 319, 349, and 354; Fig. 2A) were replaced. Previously, similar results were obtained during a mutagenesis study of conserved Cys residues of another Cys protease, the poliovirus 2A protein(36Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1992; 186: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Even the mutagenesis of nonconserved Cys residues in EAV Nsp2 was not without consequences: although a Cys-344 → Ala substitution was tolerated, the Cys-344 → His mutant was severely impaired. Conversely, a His, but not an Ala, substitution was tolerated at the position of Cys-356 (Fig. 5). Conservative replacements within a cluster of acidic residues (aa positions 291 and 295-297) did not influence proteolysis. Finally, a Gly-271 → Trp substitution completely disabled the protease. When tested in bicistronic construct pBC, a selection of these mutations produced results identical to those obtained with the monocistronic pMΔ (data not shown). We have shown that the proteolysis of the Nsp2/3 junction in the EAV ORF1a protein is not mediated by the previously described Nsp1 and Nsp4 proteases. Instead, our theoretical and experimental data strongly suggest that Nsp2 contains a novel type of Cys protease, which cleaves the Nsp2/3 site. A putative catalytic dyad was identified by comparative sequence analysis and shown to be essential for proteolytic activity (Fig. 5). The context of Cys-270 resembles that of the catalytic nucleophiles of known proteases from both the papain-like and chymotrypsin-like protease families (Fig. 2C and). Furthermore, it was shown that the Nsp2 CP forms a distinct domain which can induce cleavage of the Nsp2/3 site in trans (Fig. 4). Formally, our results do not exclude the possibility that the Nsp2 N-terminal domain serves as a co-factor for an unidentified host protease. It should be noticed, however, that to date many proteolytic cleavages in viral nonstructural polyproteins were attributed to viral proteases, whereas only two flavivirus cleavages were shown to be mediated by host proteases(37Lin C. Amberg S.M. Chambers T.J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Strauss J.H. (ed) Strauss J.H. (ed) Semin. Virol.1990: 307-384Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence experiments with infected cells have revealed that Nsp2 is associated with intracellular membranes (data not shown). This interaction may be mediated by the hydrophobic domain of Nsp2. Likewise, the extremely hydrophobic Nsp3 may be membrane-bound. Both Nsp2 and Nsp3 contain clusters of conserved Cys residues and remain associated after cleavage of the Nsp2/3 site(19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the data from our Nsp2 deletion and site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 3 and 5), these observations suggest that the formation of a specific Nsp2-Nsp3 complex, possibly involving host components like membranes, is required for proteolysis of the Nsp2/3 junction. This could explain the deleterious effects of our Nsp2 deletions and some amino acid substitutions. Our failure to demonstrate the Nsp2/3 cleavage in bacterial cells and reticulocyte lysates2 2E. J. Snijder, A. L. M. Wassenaar, W. J. M. Spaan, and A. E. Gorbalenya, unpublished data. may be attributed to the absence of certain host components. Apparently, a complex with a cleavable Nsp2/3 site can be formed when the Nsp2 CP domain is expressed separately and the remaining part of Nsp23 is intact (Fig. 4). It is also remarkable that the previously described insertion of a 10-kDa heterologous sequence into Nsp2 (at aa 427) did not affect cleavage at the Nsp2/3 site(19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive site-directed mutagenesis of Cys-270 and His-332 showed that they are indispensable for proteolytic activity. The relative position of these putative catalytic residues is typical for viral papain-like proteases. Two papain-like protease domains have been recognized in the Nsp1 region of arteriviruses (Refs. 20 and 39; Fig. 2B). In LDV and PRRSV both proteases, named PCPα and PCPβ, are cis-acting Cys proteases which produce Nsp1α and Nsp1β (39). The PRRSV/LDV PCPβ domain and Nsp1β/2 cleavage correspond to the EAV Nsp1 PCP and Nsp1/2 cleavage, respectively. The EAV counterpart of LDV/PRRSV PCPα (PCPα∗; Fig. 2B) has lost the catalytic Cys(39Den Boon J.A. Faaberg K.S. Meulenberg J.J.M. Wassenaar A.L.M. Plagemann P.G.W.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69 (in press)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nsp1 PCPs are clearly more diverged than the Nsp2 CPs (Fig. 2B), but a number of similarities can be detected and the Nsp2 CP appears to be more closely related to the viral papain-like protease group than to other currently known groups of proteases. Thus, the Nsp2 CP is likely to be another descendant of an ancestral papain-like protease. Still, two important differences between the arterivirus Nsp2 CP and viral papain-like proteases can be observed. In the first place, most viral papain-like enzymes cleave just downstream of the catalytic His residue(5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the case of the EAV Nsp2 CP approximately 500 residues separate the putative protease and its cleavage site, and this distance may even be up to 450 residues larger in other arteriviruses(19Snijder E.J. Wassenaar A.L.M. Spaan W.J.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5755-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Den Boon J.A. Faaberg K.S. Meulenberg J.J.M. Wassenaar A.L.M. Plagemann P.G.W.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69 (in press)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of all, however, the conserved Gly-271 which follows catalytic Cys-270 is a special feature of the Nsp2 CP. In arterivirus Nsp1 PCPs, and other papain-like proteases, this position is typically occupied by Trp, or sometimes another bulky amino acid, but never by Gly(5Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Remarkably, conservation of an active site Cys-Gly dipeptide is a hallmark of chymotrypsin-like Cys proteases (Fig. 2C), in which the linear order of catalytic Cys and His is reversed in comparison with papain-like proteases(4Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Sov. Sci. Rev. D. Physicochem. Biol. 1993; 11: 1-84Google Scholar). When EAV Gly-271 was replaced by Trp, the Nsp2/3 cleavage was abolished (Fig. 5). This underlines its importance and indicates that the Trp → Gly replacement is probably coupled to additional substitutions. Chymotrypsin-like proteases contain a catalytic Asp/Glu in the region separating the active site His and Ser/Cys residues. In EAV Nsp2, the region between Cys-270 and His-332 contains a conserved Asp, but mutagenesis of this and other acidic residues did not affect the Nsp2/3 cleavage (Fig. 5). However, this result may be inconclusive, since mutagenesis proved to be an inappropriate tool for the identification of a catalytic Asp in at least one viral protease(40Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the characteristics described above distinguish the Nsp2 CP from previously described papain-like and chymotrypsin-like Cys proteases. The sequence similarities observed for the arterivirus Nsp2 Cys protease can be analyzed in the context of the structural properties of the papain-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes. The fold and the linear order, context, and type of active site residues are different for both these groups of cellular proteases. The only structural resemblance between them, which was noticed previously by Garavito et al.(41Garavito R.M. Rossmann M.G. Argos P. Eventoff W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5065-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is the apparently similar organization of the catalytic triads of papain and chymotrypsin, Cys/His/Asn and Ser/His/Asp, respectively. However, these triads cannot be spatially superimposed, since they are of opposite hand. The resemblance was therefore concluded to be the result of convergent evolution(41Garavito R.M. Rossmann M.G. Argos P. Eventoff W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5065-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The recent identification of different RNA viral Cys proteases has greatly expanded the diversity of both papain-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases. Similarities within and between the two groups were highlighted (Table I), and comprehensive evidence was reported for the common ancestry of a part of the RNA viral Cys proteases and the cellular and viral chymotrypsin-like Ser proteases (13, 14, 42). Due to the lack of structural data, the evolutionary relationships between cellular and viral papain-like proteases, including the arterivirus Nsp2 CP, are less clear, but the available amino acid sequence information favors divergent evolution. On the basis of the analysis of the triplets encoding a variety of catalytic Ser residues, Brenner has postulated previously that an ancestral Cys protease may have preceded the chymotrypsin-like Ser proteases(10Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The analysis of present day chymotrypsin-like Cys proteases points toward the conserved Gly-X-Cys-Gly sequence (Table I) as the most plausible context of the catalytic Cys residue in such an ancestral chymotrypsin-like protease. Remarkably, this characteristic Gly-X-Cys-Gly sequence is also conserved in the catalytic center of the arterivirus Nsp2 Cys proteases that belong to the papain-like group (Table I). Although divergent evolution could obviously provide the most parsimonious explanation for this similarity between chymotrypsin-like and Nsp2 Cys proteases, this interpretation cannot be reconciled with the postulated convergent evolution of the prototypes of the two families, chymotrypsin and papain(41Garavito R.M. Rossmann M.G. Argos P. Eventoff W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5065-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Future studies of RNA virus proteases, particularly the arterivirus Nsp2 CP, may resolve this puzzle and increase our insight in a possible evolutionary relationship between papain-like and chymotrypsin-like proteases.Table I:Gly - Open table in a new tab We thank Johan den Boon, Leonie van Dinten, and Peter Bredenbeek for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript.

For serpins to adopt a canonical conformation, the helical reactive center loop must unfold with its N-terminal stalk inserted into the gap between strands 3 and 5 of the A sheet(15Stein P.E.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). After docking with the enzyme, the loop is presumed to insert further into the A sheet to form an extended canonical structure that fits the substrate-binding site of the cognate proteinase, the locking conformation(17Skriver K.

It is clear that the sequence of events involved in proteinase inhibition requires the loop to be mobile and to adopt a variety of conformations. A consequence of this is the formation of the so-called “latent” conformation (by analogy with the corresponding reactivable form of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(6Mottonen J. Strand A.

A second consequence is the formation of loop-sheet polymers in which the reactive center loop of one molecule is inserted into a β-pleated sheet of a second. This interaction accounts for the biologically important retention of Z (23Cox D.W. Billingsley G.D. Callahan J.W.

Polymerization of Z antitrypsin is blocked by annealing homologue reactive loop peptides to the A sheet (24), and on this basis, it was reasonably deduced that loop-sheet polymerization occurs due to the insertion of the loop of one molecule into the A sheet of the next. The phenomenon of loop-sheet polymerization is not restricted to antitrypsin and has now been reported in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (26Mikus P. Urano T. Liljeström P. Ny T. Eur. J.

This material was then heated at 60°C for 3 h to convert any residual active antitrypsin to polymer(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The presence of residual thermostable latent antitrypsin was detected by nondenaturing PAGE and a concomitant loss of inhibitory activity against bovine α-chymotrypsin(22Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R.

Antitrypsin Mmalton was isolated from 130 ml of plasma and eluted from the Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column as two distinct peaks: one at a sodium chloride concentration similar to that of M and Z antitrypsin (38Lomas D.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (denoted fraction 1) and the other at a sodium chloride concentration similar to that of antitrypsin Siiyama (25Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (denoted fraction 2). The protein in each of these fractions was characterized separately. The antitrypsin in fraction 1 migrated as a 52-kDa band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), but protein estimation from the extinction coefficient resulted in underloading when compared with M and Z antitrypsin controls. Amino acid analysis confirmed the extinction coefficient (ɛ1%280) of antitrypsin Mmalton to be 11.1 rather than 5.3 (39Travis J. Johnson D. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 754-765Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for M antitrypsin. Amino-terminal sequencing following transfer onto Problot membrane showed that antitrypsin Mmalton in the early eluting peak of fraction 1 was cleaved at the amino terminus (5DAAQK-), whereas that of the main peak was intact (1EDPQG-) as described previously for Z antitrypsin(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Fraction 2 migrated as multiple bands on SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis revealed the antitrypsin to be present as 52- and 48-kDa species (Fig. 1); both were intact at the N terminus (1EDPQG-), and the 48-kDa species had the same electrophoretic mobility as reactive center loop-cleaved M antitrypsin. The cleaved protein was detected in all four purifications of antitrypsin Mmalton, in Western blot analysis of the starting material, and following antitrypsin antibody immunopurification of fraction 2 (Fig. 2). The C-terminal peptide liberated following reactive loop cleavage was not detected by SDS-PAGE of fraction 2 (Fig. 2) or by reverse-phase HPLC. The specific activities of fractions 1 and 2 were 66 and <1%, respectively, when the total protein in fraction 1 was determined by amino acid analysis. The value for fraction 1 compares with 77% for M antitrypsin and 50% for Z antitrypsin purified using the same protocol; the reduced activity of Z compared with M antitrypsin reflects contaminating loop-sheet dimers.Figure 2:A, 7.5-15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE of Mmalton polymers and M antitrypsin following immunopurification.

As fraction 2 contains no monomeric antitrypsin, the reactive center loop-cleaved antitrypsin must be an integral component of the polymers. The conformation and stability of antitrypsin in these two fractions were assessed by unfolding on transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis. Monomeric antitrypsin Mmalton (fraction 1) unfolded with a profile similar to that of native M and Z antitrypsin (Fig. 3). M and Mmalton antitrypsin cleaved at the reactive center loop with S. aureus V8 proteinase failed to unfold in 8 M urea, indicating that the A β-sheet had been stabilized by insertion of the reactive loop peptide. Similarly, M and Mmalton antitrypsin polymers formed by heating at 60°C and antitrypsin Mmalton polymers isolated from the plasma were resistant to unfolding in 8 M urea. The antitrypsin Mmalton polymers isolated from the plasma migrated farther into the gel than M and Mmalton antitrypsin polymers formed by heating at 60°C. This reflects the nondenaturing PAGE and electron micrograph observations (Fig. 4) that circulating antitrypsin Mmalton polymers are shorter and hence of lower molecular mass than M and Mmalton antitrypsin polymers formed in vitro.Figure 4:Electron micrographs of antitrypsin Mmalton monomers (upper panel) and polymers (middle panel) isolated from plasma. Shown in the lower panel, for comparative purposes, are M antitrypsin polymers formed by heating M antitrypsin (0.25 mg/ml) at 65°C for 12 h. All preparations were stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. As antitrypsin Mmalton polymers isolated from plasma were only partially pure, the polymers were shown to be antitrypsin by the attachment of polyclonal antitrypsin antibodies, which were then visualized by negative staining and electron microscopy (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isolated monomeric antitrypsin Mmalton polymerized less readily than Z antitrypsin, but more readily than M antitrypsin, after heating at 0.6 mg/ml and 40°C (Fig. 5). The resulting polymers showed similar electrophoretic mobility to Z antitrypsin polymers formed under identical conditions. Monomeric antitrypsin Mmalton accepted an 11-mer antithrombin reactive center loop peptide at a significantly slower rate than M or Z antitrypsin (t for M antitrypsin = 30-60 min, for Z antitrypsin = 2 h, and for Mmalton = 24 h) (Fig. 6). This implies that the Phe52 deletion closes or distorts the gap between strands 3 and 5 of the A sheet or that the reactive center loop adopts a conformation that hinders exogenous peptide insertion.Figure 6:7.5-15% (w/v) nondenaturing PAGE showing the rate of insertion of an 11-mer antithrombin reactive center loop peptide into M, Z, and Mmalton antitrypsin.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and it is plausible that distortion of this domain may perturb the loop and so affect the inhibitory kinetics with serine proteinases. Antitrypsin Mmalton had an essentially normal association rate constant and Ki value with human neutrophil elastase (2.9 ± 0.03 × 107M−1 s−1 and <5 pM (Fig. 7A), respectively, compared with 5.3 ± 0.06 × 107M−1 s−1 and <5 pM for M antitrypsin(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)) and with bovine α-chymotrypsin (3.0 ± 0.02 × 106M−1 s−1 and <5 pM, respectively, compared with 2.6 ± 0.2 × 106M−1 s−1 and 9.2 ± 2.7 pM for M antitrypsin(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar)) and was able to form SDS-stable complexes (Fig. 7B). Limited proteolysis of the reactive loop with S. aureus V8 proteinase (which cleaves at P4-P5) and papaya proteinase IV (which cleaves at P9-P10) showed no differences between Mmalton and native M antitrypsin (data not shown). Distortion of the A sheet did not prevent the insertion of the reactive center loop peptide after cleavage as antitrypsin Mmalton monomer was able to undergo the S to R (active to cleaved) transition (Fig. 8). More specifically, antitrypsin Mmalton was induced to polymerize upon heating at temperatures in excess of 60°C, and this was prevented by the insertion of the reactive loop peptide into the A sheet. Similarly, heating both M and Mmalton antitrypsin at 67°C for 12 h in 0.7 M sodium citrate produced a thermostable monomeric species (data not shown) that we have recently characterized as the latent conformation(22Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Chang W.-S.W. Wardell M.R. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrated that purified Z antitrypsin was able to polymerize more readily than antitrypsin Mmalton, which in turn polymerized more readily than M antitrypsin. To confirm this observation in vivo and to show that antitrypsin Mmalton is retained at the same point of processing as Z antitrypsin, these mutants, along with an M antitrypsin control, were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. M antitrypsin secreted from the oocytes was 65 ± 7.6% (S.E.) of the total synthesized antitrypsin. Both Z and Mmalton antitrypsin had reduced secretion of 11.1 ± 3.3 and 19.8 ± 3.1%, respectively. The experiments were performed on at least four occasions for each variant, and on each occasion, the secretion was the sum of 20 injected oocytes. The retained Z and Mmalton antitrypsin were sensitive to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 9), localizing them to a pre-Golgi compartment, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum. We have previously shown that Z antitrypsin forms intracellular inclusions in the liver of Z homozygotes by a unique protein-protein interaction, loop-sheet polymerization(24Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Similar loop-sheet polymers have been isolated from the plasma of an individual who is a homozygote for the Siiyama mutation(25Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation, Ser53 → Phe, is located in the B helix and similarly results in the formation of hepatic inclusions(44Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Takabe K. Takahashi H. Miyake K. Kira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12627-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only other identified mutation that predisposes to the formation of inclusions is Phe52 deletion, which has been variously named Mmalton (33, 34, 37), Mnichinan(45Matsunaga E. Shiokawa S. Nakamura H. Maruyama T. Tsuda K. Fukumaki Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 602-612PubMed Google Scholar), and Mcagliari(46Sergi C. Consalez G.C. Fabbretti G. Brisigotti M. Faa G. Costa V. Romeo G. Callea F. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 130-133PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that as predicted(24Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), this point mutation also favors the formation of loop-sheet polymers. Furthermore, several associated findings provide strong support for the proposal (9Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 28Eldering E. Verpy E. Roem D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol.

Blood. 1994; 84 (Suppl. 1 (abstr.)): 391aCrossref Google Scholar) that the polymerization occurs through the linking of the reactive loop of one molecule to the C, rather than the A, sheet of the next. Specifically, the findings are compatible with the occurrence of a spontaneous and inappropriate change in conformation of the variant antitrypsin toward that normally adopted by the inhibitor in the stable complex with the proteinase(47Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The structure of this “locking” conformation has not been determined, but there is evidence to support the conclusion (47) that it involves a partial reincorporation of the loop (48Björk I. Nordling K. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6501-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) together with release of strand 1C of the molecule(28Eldering E. Verpy E. Roem D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Antitrypsin Mmalton was isolated from the plasma of an Mmalton/QO (null) bolton heterozygote as two distinct peaks that represented monomer and polymer. Antitrypsin Mmalton polymers were inactive as an inhibitor of bovine α-chymotrypsin and were resistant to unfolding on transverse 0-8 M urea gradient gels. These data support our hypothesis that polymers result from the linkage of the reactive loop of one molecule with the β-pleated sheet of a second. Such an interaction obscures the scissile P1-P1′ bond of the reactive center loop, rendering the protein inactive, but also stabilizes the A sheet of the receptor molecule. Antitrypsin Mmalton formed long chain polymers in vitro (Fig. 5), but the polymers isolated from plasma were predominantly only 2-5 molecules in length (Fig. 1). This differed from the plasma findings in the Siiyama homozygote, in which the polymers were formed by 15-20 molecules of antitrypsin Siiyama (25). The findings do, however, resemble those recently described for a variant of antithrombin, Rouen VI Asn187 → Asp(30Bruce D. Perry D. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which forms short chain polymers. These polymers were truncated at 2-3 units by the complete conversion of the terminal molecule to the latent form. We initially thought that antitrypsin Mmalton might similarly undergo a spontaneous transition to the latent form and hence result in short polymers. Although it was shown that the variant antitrypsin could be induced into the latent form, this conformation was not detected in either the monomeric or polymeric fraction from plasma. The clue to the process limiting the length of Mmalton polymers in vivo was provided by the finding that a proportion of the molecules in the polymers isolated from plasma had been cleaved at the reactive center (Fig. 1). This finding is in keeping with a mechanism in which polymerization of antitrypsin Mmalton occurs as a result of a preceding transition to the locking conformation that is normally adopted to stabilize the proteinase-inhibitor complex(47Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The combination of a partially exposed reactive center loop together with a released strand from the C sheet will allow the formation of sequential loop-sheet linkages to give polymerization. In vitro, and presumably in the protected environment of the endoplasmic pathway, this sequential linkage will allow the formation of long chain polymers as shown in Fig. 5. However, within the plasma, the presence of extraneous proteinases explains the truncation of polymerization by cleavage of the exposed loop of the terminal molecule. The apparent absence of the C-terminal peptide from the reactive loop-cleaved component of the plasma polymers is both unexpected and intriguing (Fig. 2). This peptide is usually tightly bound to the body of the molecule of serpins cleaved in vitro and can only be dissociated by strong denaturing conditions. The absence of the peptide from the cleaved component of the Mmalton polymers implies that dissociation may follow cleavage of the locking conformation in which strand 1C release has occurred. As compared with the Z and Siiyama variants, antitrypsin Mmalton is relatively stable. The majority of antitrypsin Mmalton present in plasma is in the monomeric form, has essentially normal inhibitory kinetics, and forms SDS-stable complexes with bovine α-chymotrypsin. Moreover, Mmalton has the same limited proteolysis profile as antitrypsin following digestion with bovine α-chymotrypsin (P1-P1′), S. aureus V8 proteinase (P4-P5), and papaya proteinase IV (P9-P10). This compares with Z antitrypsin, which has modified inhibitory kinetics (38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 49Ogushi F. Fells G.A. Hubbard R.C. Straus S.D. Crystal R.G. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and is not susceptible to cleavage at P9-P10(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Monomeric antitrypsin Mmalton forms long chain polymers on incubation in vitro at a faster rate than M antitrypsin, but at a slower rate than Z antitrypsin (Fig. 5). All of these findings fit with a common molecular pathology that explains the accumulation of these three variants of antitrypsin within the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver. We believe the shared abnormality is a tendency for overinsertion of the reactive loop in the inhibitor molecule to give a spontaneous conformational change with release of strand 1C. The consequent formation of loop-C sheet-linked polymers will vary in rate depending on the nature of the underlying mutation. Polymerization is more marked in the Siiyama variant, in which all the plasma antitrypsin is polymerized(25Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and less so in the Z variant, which is predominantly present in plasma as the monomer, although the inaccessibility of its P9-P10 bond to proteolysis infers partial insertion of its loop(38Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S.W. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mmalton circulates in a virtually normal functional form, but its decreased rate of formation of binary complexes (Fig. 6) indicates that its own loop is likely to be overinserted and to inhibit homologue peptide insertion. The difference in severity of the molecular lesions of the two antitrypsin variants is confirmed by the reduced secretion of Z as compared with Mmalton in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Z and Mmalton, but not M, antitrypsin were retained within the oocyte at a pre-Golgi stage most likely to be in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, the secretion of antitrypsin Mmalton was almost twice that of Z antitrypsin, reflecting the reduced rate of forming loop-sheet polymers. These and other results(9Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 30Bruce D. Perry D. Borg J.-Y. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Clin.

https://openalex.org/W2053643150,"Interaction of the rat A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) with G-proteins has been assessed using a stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell system. The non-selective AR agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) increased the labeling of a 41-kDa membrane protein by 4-azidoanilido-[α-32P]guanosine 5′-triphosphate (AA-[32P]GTP), a photolabile GTP analogue. Subsequent immunoprecipitation of Giα-subunits indicated that NECA stimulated incorporation of label into both Giα-2 and Giα-3. Additional experiments revealed an A3AR stimulation of label into Gq and/or G11α-subunits, albeit to a lesser degree than that elicited by endogenous P2U purinergic receptors. No interaction with Gs could be detected. Sustained cellular exposure to NECA induced A3AR desensitization and specific down-regulation of Giα-3 and G-protein β-subunits without changing levels of Giα-2, Gsα, or Gq+11α-subunits. Therefore the A3AR can interact with Giα-2, Giα-3, and, to some extent, Gq-like proteins, but sustained agonist exposure down-regulates only one of the G-proteins with which it interacts. This is the first description of the differing specificities of A3AR/G-protein coupling versus down-regulation in situ and provides a potential mechanism by which the A3AR could elicit the heterologous desensitization of signaling events mediated by Gi3.

The multiple physiological effects of adenosine are mediated by activation of cell surface adenosine receptors (ARs) 1The abbreviations used are: ARadenosine receptorG-proteinguanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteinAA-[32P]GTP4-azidoanilido-[α-32P]guanosine 5′-triphosphate125I-AB-MECA125I-4-aminoben-zyl-5′-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosineNECA5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosinePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPTxpertussis toxin. 1The abbreviations used are: ARadenosine receptorG-proteinguanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteinAA-[32P]GTP4-azidoanilido-[α-32P]guanosine 5′-triphosphate125I-AB-MECA125I-4-aminoben-zyl-5′-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosineNECA5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosinePVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPTxpertussis toxin.1(1Olsson R.A. Pearson D. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 761-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular cloning studies have facilitated classification of these G-protein-coupled receptors into four subtypes, denoted as A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 (2, 3). The A3AR cDNA clone was initially isolated from a rat brain cDNA library and was classed as a distinct AR subtype due to its distinct agonist potency series compared with A1 and A2AR subtypes and, most intriguingly, its insensitivity to inhibition by alkylxanthine compounds(4Zhou Q.-Y. Li C. Olah M.E. Johnson R.A. Stiles G.L. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7432-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The isolation of an A3AR cDNA has implicated this receptor in mediating some physiological effects of adenosine. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the A3AR is the AR responsible for enhancing antigen-stimulated secretion in a rat mast cell line, RBL-2H3 (5, 6). Subsequently isolated AR cDNAs from sheep and human sources, which exhibit a 70% amino acid identity with the rat A3AR, have also been designated as A3ARs, although differences in their pharmacological properties versus the rat protein make it unclear as to whether these proteins are species homologues or constitute a distinct AR subtype(7Linden J.

Agonist-induced desensitization, or refractoriness, is a universal feature of G-protein-coupled receptors, including the various AR subtypes(9Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 217-231Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that, for many receptors, desensitization can be divided into two temporally and mechanistically distinct phases: short term agonist exposure can induce receptor phosphorylation, which in turn can impair receptor/G-protein interaction(9Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 217-231Google Scholar, 10Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Longer agonist treatment times can result in down-regulation of the receptor and/or its associated G-protein, as well as the up-regulation of components controlling opposing signaling pathways(9Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Sibley D.R. Houslay M.D. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 217-231Google Scholar). Rapid, homologous functional desensitization of A3AR-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization has been reported in RBL-2H3 cells(5Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ramkumar V. Stiles G.L. Beaven M.A. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16887-16890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of chronic agonist exposure on A3AR signaling have not been investigated. In this regard, it has been suggested that chronic agonist exposure can result in the specific down-regulation of the G-protein with which a receptor preferentially couples. This phenomenon has been studied extensively in rat adipocytes both in the intact animal (11Longabaugh J.P. Didsbury J. Spiegel A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar) and in primary adipocyte cultures (12Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that chronic stimulation of the rat A1AR results in the heterologous desensitization of other anti-lipolytic hormone responses due to the down-regulation of Gi proteins(13Green A. Milligan G. Dobias S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3223-3229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These changes are not the result of reduced gene transcription, as mRNA levels for each of the three Giα-subunits expressed in adipocytes are unaffected by agonist treatment(11Longabaugh J.P. Didsbury J. Spiegel A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar). Similar phenomena have since been described for several G-protein-coupled receptors, including those coupled to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase via Gs(14McKenzie F.R. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17084-17093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phospholipase C via Gq and G11(15Mullaney I. Dodd M.W. Buckley N. Milligan G. Biochem.

Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19933-19940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the few cases examined, it has been proposed that agonist occupation of the appropriate receptor reduces the half-life of the G-protein with which it interacts, thereby resulting in down-regulation(18Mitchell F.M. Buckley N.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Hadcock J.R. Ros M. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14784-14790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With these observations in mind, the goals of the present study were: (a) to determine the identity of the G-proteins with which the A3AR interacts, and (b) to determine whether chronic A3AR activation could modulate expression of these proteins. Cell culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. NECA was the generous gift of Dr. Ray Olsson (University of South Florida, Tampa, FL). 125I-AB-MECA was synthesized and purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously(20Olah M.E.

PVDF membranes and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated recombinant protein A were from Pierce. UTP was from Sigma. Sources of other materials have been described elsewhere (20, 22). Cell lines stably expressing the pCMV5-rat A3AR and pBC12BI-canine A2aAR constructs have been previously described and characterized(20Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982PubMed Google Scholar, 22Palmer T.M. Gettys T.W. Jacobson K.J. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1082-1094PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a 37°C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were grown as monolayers in T-75 flasks and used just prior to reaching confluence. Cells from one T-75 flask were washed, scraped into 5 ml of lysis buffer (5 mM Hepes, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and disrupted by Dounce homogenization on ice (20 strokes). After centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 10 min, the crude membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer to a concentration of approximately 1 mg of protein/ml and aliquoted for storage at −80°C. The generation and specificities of all but one of the anti-peptide antisera used in this study have been demonstrated previously(23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Gettys T.W. Fields T.A. Raymond J.R.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antiserum 457 was generated against a decapeptide whose sequence is identical to that of the COOH termini of Gqα and G11α(26Strathmann M. Wilkie T. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7407-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reactivity with Gqα and G11α and a lack of cross-reactivity with inhibitory G-protein α-subunits have been assessed using recombinant proteins in immunoblotting studies (data not shown). Additionally, although antiserum 982 was raised against the carboxyl-terminal decapeptide sequence common to rod and cone transducins, as well as Giα-1 and Giα-2, the restricted expression of the transducins and the lack of expression of Giα-1 in CHO cells (23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Gettys T.W. Sheriff-Carter K. Moomaw J. Taylor I.L. Raymond J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) means that this antiserum can be used as a specific tool for identification of Giα-2 in this system. The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting at the concentrations indicated in parentheses: 982 (1 in 4000 dilution of serum) for detection of Giα-2, 977 (1 in 4000 dilution of serum) for detection of Giα-3, 951 (1 in 8000 dilution of serum) for detection of Gsα, 457 (1 in 1000 dilution of protein A affinity-purified IgG) for detection of Gqα and G11α, and 987 (1 in 4000 dilution of serum) for detection of G-protein β-subunits. After solubilization in electrophoresis sample buffer, equivalent amounts of membrane protein (typically 75 μg/sample) were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide resolving gels. Resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and nonspecific protein binding sites blocked by a 60-min incubation at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.02% (w/v) thimerosal). Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate dilution of primary antiserum in fresh blocking buffer for either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. After removal of antiserum and extensive washing with three changes of blocking buffer, the membrane was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with a 1 in 5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A in a high detergent skim milk solution. The series of washes described above was then repeated and followed by two further washes in phosphate-buffered saline alone. Reactive proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence protocol in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Renaissance, DuPont NEN). Quantitation of immunoblots was by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs using a Bio-Rad model 620 densitometer with analysis by the 1-D Analyst software package. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the amounts of membrane protein and primary antibody dilutions employed produced signals within the linear response range of our detection methods (data not shown). These were performed as described previously (24Gettys T.W. Fields T.A. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (1994): 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) except that freshly isolated crude cell membranes (prepared as described above) were used and adenosine deaminase was added to a concentration of 1 unit/ml. Quantitation was by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs. Immunoprecipitations using the indicated anti-G-protein subunit antisera described above were performed essentially as described previously(23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Gettys T.W. Fields T.A. Raymond J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33 (1994): 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Binding studies using the high affinity A3AR radioligand 125I-AB-MECA and adenylyl cyclase assays were performed and analyzed as described previously(20Olah M.E. Gallo-Rodriguez C. Jacobson K.A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 978-982PubMed Google Scholar). To examine A3AR interaction with and regulation of G-proteins, a transfected CHO cell system was chosen, thereby allowing the use of non-transfected CHO cells as an appropriate negative control. The level of expression of the recombinant A3AR in this system was determined using the high affinity A3AR agonist radioligand 125I-AB-MECA in saturation binding experiments (Fig. 1A). This ligand bound to a single saturable high affinity site in membranes from transfected cells, with Kd and Bmax values of 1.4 ± 0.4 nM and 3.7 ± 0.4 pmol/mg membrane protein, respectively (three experiments). Moreover, the expressed A3AR was functional as the non-selective AR agonist NECA could elicit a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes from transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Neither specific binding of 125I-AB-MECA nor inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was observed in non-transfected CHO cells (data not shown). It has been documented that the abilities of recombinant A3ARs in transfected CHO cells to inhibit cAMP accumulation and endogenous A3ARs in RBL-2H3 cells to stimulate phospholipase C are abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin(4Zhou Q.-Y. Li C. Olah M.E. Johnson R.A. Stiles G.L. Civelli O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7432-7436Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 5Ali H. Cunha-Melo J.R. Saul W.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the nature of the A3AR/Gi-protein interaction, a photolabile GTP analogue (AA-[32P]GTP) was used to assess A3AR-stimulated G-protein activation(22Palmer T.M. Gettys T.W. Jacobson K.J. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1082-1094PubMed Google Scholar, 23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Using this approach, it was determined that NECA could stimulate an increase in the labeling of a 41-kDa protein in membranes from A3AR cDNA-transfected but not in non-transfected CHO cells; this effect was dose-dependent, with half-maximal effects occurring at a NECA concentration of 0.2 μM (Fig. 2A). The -fold increase in labeling over basal at a saturating dose of NECA was between 3- and 6-fold (four experiments). The identity of the Gi protein(s) activated by the A3AR was deduced by immunoprecipitating each of Giα-2 and Giα-3 from crude membranes after AA-[32P]GTP labeling using subtype-specific antibodies (Fig. 2B). This demonstrated that NECA increased incorporation of label into each of the precipitated proteins, thereby demonstrating that the A3AR is capable of interacting with both Giα-2 and Giα-3 in this system. It has been recently demonstrated that receptors thought previously to couple exclusively to Gi proteins can also interact with other signaling systems. One example of this is the α2A adrenergic receptor, which, as well as coupling to multiple Gi proteins, can also activate Gs and Gq(27Kurose H. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3335-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 28Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Liggett S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 696-702PubMed Google Scholar, 29Conklin B.R. Chabre O. Wong Y.H. Federman A.D. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments performed on recombinant G-protein α-subunits have demonstrated that Gsα-subunits have a much lower affinity for AA-[32P]GTP than Gi proteins (30). Therefore, despite the fact that no agonist-stimulated photoincorporation into a 48-kDa band was observed (the size of Gsα-subunits in CHO cells as determined by immunoblotting; Ref. 22), we could not immediately eliminate the possibility that the A3AR was capable of coupling to Gs. Therefore we assayed cell membranes for effects of A3AR activation on GTP-stimulated, i.e. “basal,” adenylyl cyclase activity. In non-transfected CHO cells, 50 μM NECA produced a 6 ± 4% activation of adenylyl cyclase activity above that of GTP alone. In contrast, the addition of 50 μM NECA to membranes from A3AR-expressing CHO cells inhibited basal activity by 57 ± 7% (three experiments). Under the same conditions, the addition of 50 μM NECA to membranes from CHO cells expressing 0.26-0.30 pmol/mg A2aAR, a prototypical Gs-coupled receptor(22Palmer T.M. Gettys T.W. Jacobson K.J. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1082-1094PubMed Google Scholar), elicited a 19.7 ± 0.5-fold increase over GTP-stimulated activity (10 experiments). To determine whether A3AR activation of Gi was masking an interaction between the A3AR and Gs, assays were also performed after treatment of CHO cells with 20 ng/ml PTx for 24 h, an incubation sufficient to ADP-ribosylate the total cellular pool of Gi as determined by subsequent [32P]ADP-ribosylation experiments on isolated membranes (22). Under these conditions, we observed a 79 ± 12% loss of the ability of 50 μM NECA to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (three experiments) consistent with the inactivation of almost all functional Gi. However, this treatment did not unmask an activation of adenylyl cyclase activity: in membranes from PTx-treated cells, the addition of 50 μM NECA to membranes merely attenuated inhibition of GTP-stimulated activity from 57 ± 7% to 17 ± 12% (three experiments). To assess potential A3AR interaction with Gq and G11, membranes were photolabeled with AA-[32P]GTP followed by immunoprecipitation with antibody 457 (anti-Gq+11). Preliminary immunoblotting experiments with 457 demonstrated that under these conditions 457 specifically immunoprecipitates a 42-kDa band that co-migrates with Gq+11α-subunits on SDS-PAGE, and that these immunoprecipitates are devoid of detectable Giα-2 and Giα-3 proteins, as determined by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates with antisera 982 and 977, respectively (data not shown). As a positive control for the photolabeling experiments, we made use of the endogenous P2U purinergic receptor expressed by CHO-K1 cells. Agonist occupation of this receptor raises intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in a manner that is resistant to modulation by PTx treatment, indicating that the response is mediated by G-proteins belonging to the Gq family(31Iredale P.A. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Analysis of total membranes after photolabeling indicated that under conditions where the addition of 10 μM NECA produced a 2-3-fold increase in the incorporation of label into the 41-kDa band (which presumably consists of Giα-2 and Giα-3; Fig. 2), no such increase was noted after the addition of 100 μM UTP, a P2U purinergic receptor agonist (Fig. 3A). However, after membrane solubilization and immunoprecipitation with antiserum 457, a single 42-kDa labeled band is observed (Fig. 3B), which presumably consists of a mixture of Gqα and G11α, both of which are expressed in CHO cells(32Mullaney I.M. Mitchell F.M. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The agonist-modulated labeling of the immunoprecipitated 42-kDa band is quite distinct from that observed for the 41-kDa band in total membranes (Fig. 3, A and B). The addition of UTP increases the labeling of the 42-kDa band by some 2-2.5-fold, whereas 10 μM NECA increases labeling by 1.3-1.5-fold (ranges of values from two experiments). Therefore agonist-occupied A3ARs are capable of increasing the labeling of Gq-like proteins in membranes from transfected CHO cells, albeit to a lesser degree than that elicited by endogenous activated P2U purinergic receptors. To determine whether the activated A3AR could regulate the expression of the G-proteins with which it interacts, cells were treated with 10 μM NECA for up to 24 h and membranes prepared for comparative immunoblotting experiments. These demonstrated that while the expression of Giα-2 and Gq+11α-subunits are unaffected by prolonged agonist occupancy of A3ARs, Giα-3 undergoes a profound down-regulation (Fig. 4, A and B;). This effect was absolutely dependent on the expression of the A3AR since parallel treatment of non-transfected CHO cells failed to alter levels of Giα-3 (Fig. 4C). Additionally this figure also demonstrates that constitutive expression of the A3AR did not significantly alter the levels of expression of Giα-3 in transfected versus non-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 4C). Expression levels of Gsα were not greatly affected by agonist treatment (Table I). However, levels of the β-subunits common to all G-proteins decreased by approximately 60% (Fig. 5 and); as for Giα-3, this effect could not be observed in non-transfected CHO cells (data not shown). Under these conditions, the A3AR underwent a functional desensitization, as manifested by an increase in the IC50 value for NECA-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 6).Table I:Agonist regulation of G-protein expression in CHO cells expressing the rat A3AR Open table in a new tab Figure 5:Agonist-mediated down-regulation of G-protein β-subunits in A3AR-transfected CHO cells. 75 μg of crude membrane protein from cells treated in the absence (Control) or presence (Treated) of 10 μM NECA for 24 h were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF for immunoblotting with antisera 987 (anti-β-subunits) as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Agonist-mediated desensitization of A3AR function.

This is one of multiple experiments, which produced quantitatively similar data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects on G-protein subunit expression of treating transfected cells with increasing concentrations of NECA are shown in Fig. 7. The EC50 values for loss of Giα-3 and β-subunits are similar (∼60 nM and 80 nM, respectively), suggesting an equivalent dependence of each process on agonist occupation of A3ARs. However, treatment of transfected CHO cells with 10 μM NECA for various times demonstrates that their respective time courses of down-regulation are distinct (Fig. 8). While Giα-3 undergoes a steady down-regulation observable at 4 h and maximal by 16 h exposure (Fig. 8, A and C), β-subunit down-regulation is biphasic; a rapid initial reduction in expression, observable at 2 h, stabilizes until after 8 h, when the subsequent rate of β-subunit down-regulation more closely parallels that of Giα-3 (Fig. 8, B and C).Figure 8:Time courses of G-protein subunit down-regulation. 75 μg of membrane protein from A3AR-expressing CHO cells treated with 10 μM NECA for the indicated times were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting with anti-Giα-3 antiserum 977 (panel A) or anti-β-subunit antiserum 987 (panel B). Panel C is a quantitative analysis of three separate time course experiments performed for each of these proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The adaptive responses of cells to sustained hormone exposure operate at several different levels. While rapid covalent modifications of receptors by various kinases are most likely responsible for initiating short term desensitization, prolonged agonist treatment invokes distinct processes. A common phenomenon exhibited by many G-protein-coupled receptors is that of down-regulation, defined as a loss in the total number of receptors expressed by the cell. Such receptor-specific events are presumably responsible for the homologous desensitization exhibited by many receptors, but cannot explain heterologous desensitization phenomena, whereby exposure to a given agonist can desensitize responses elicited by other hormone receptors. One potential mechanism of heterologous desensitization is that of regulation of G-protein function and expression, since changes at this level via one receptor would be expected to affect the signaling capacity of any other receptor that utilizes the particular G-protein to activate its appropriate effector. Evidence in support of this hypothesis has accumulated over recent years, due to the availability of antisera capable of discriminating among the multiple G-protein subunits expressed in many cell types(11Longabaugh J.P. Didsbury J. Spiegel A. Stiles G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar, 12Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 413-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In particular, many studies have demonstrated that chronic cellular exposure to specific agonists results in a rapid down-regulation of the G-protein which that receptor might be expected to activate upon agonist occupancy; these effects are generally independent of second messenger generation despite the requirement for receptor activation (33). Additionally, receptor-independent, constitutive activation of Gs by cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation induces a rapid loss of total cellular levels of Gs that is independent of the initial increase in cAMP levels(34Milligan G. Unson C.G. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Chang F.-H. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5352-5357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S49 cyc− lymphoma cells transfected with an epitope-tagged Gsα construct, the cholera toxin-stimulated down-regulation is due to an enhanced degradation of the protein, as manifested by a reduced biological half-life, and is associated with a shift in the subcellular distribution of Gsα from the membrane to the cytosol(36Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). With these observations in mind, the present study was undertaken. The A3AR has been shown to increase phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity in RBL-2H3 cells (5, 6) and inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity in transfected CHO cells (4). Both of these effects are abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting a role for Gi proteins. In the transfected CHO cell system we have shown, using sequential G-protein photolabeling and immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies, that the A3AR is capable of interacting with, and presumably activating, both Giα-2 and Giα-3 in isolated membranes. Interestingly, these are the same two pertussis toxin substrates that are expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (37Hide M. Ali H. Price S.R. Moss J. Beaven M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 473-479PubMed Google Scholar) and suggest that the endogenously expressed A3AR in these cells is at least capable of interacting with these proteins to produce its downstream effects. Presumably, the pertussis toxin-sensitive A3AR-stimulated increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in RBL-2H3 cells is due to increased levels of dissociated Gi-derived βγ-subunits activating phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-β isoforms, an interaction that has been demonstrated both in intact cells (38Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15776-15785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with purified components(39Hepler J.R. Kozasa T. Smrcka A.V. Simon M.I. Rhee S.G. Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14367-14375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we were also able to reveal an interaction of the A3AR with Gq-like proteins expressed in CHO cells, and this would suggest that, at least in some instances, A3AR stimulation of phospholipase C may have a PTx-insensitive component. The generality and significance of A3AR/Gq/11 interaction in systems expressing A3ARs endogenously remain to be determined. No stimulatory effect of A3AR activation on adenylyl cyclase activity could be determined, suggesting that the A3AR does not interact significantly with Gs. Chronic agonist exposure of A3AR-expressing CHO cells induces the specific down-regulation of Giα-3 and not Giα-2 or Gq+11α-subunits, despite the ability of the receptor to activate each of these proteins. This effect required agonist occupation of the A3AR, as no down-regulation was observed in native CHO cells, which express undetectable levels of functional A3ARs. The loss of Giα-3 was associated with a similarly profound reduction in the levels of β-subunits common to all G-proteins. The reductions in expression of these proteins exhibited similar dose dependence values to increasing concentrations of NECA. Additionally, the EC50 value for NECA stimulation of AA-[32P]GTP incorporation into Gi proteins was also similar to the EC50 values for G-protein subunit down-regulation, suggesting a possible link between G-protein activation and down-regulation. Under these conditions, A3AR-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase underwent a functional desensitization. We cannot determine at the present time the contribution of G-protein down-regulation to the overall process of A3AR desensitization; as we have previously demonstrated, receptor desensitization is a complex phenomenon involving several distinct processes whose importance to the overall effect varies upon length of agonist exposure. In particular, receptor down-regulation may play a role, but we cannot test this due to the unavailability of a radiolabeled antagonist ligand for the A3AR. Nevertheless, such a profound down-regulation of Giα-3 would be expected to impair downstream signaling events elicited by any receptor with which it could interact. The profound loss of β-subunits was a surprising finding from these studies and is perplexing considering the quantity of Giα-3 expressed in these cells. Quantitative immunoblotting studies in CHO-K1 cells using E. coli-derived recombinant proteins as standards have shown that Giα-2 is present at an 8-fold molar excess over Giα-3 (4.8 versus 0.6 pmol/mg membrane protein)(23Raymond J.R. Olsen C.L. Gettys T.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11064-11073Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Gettys T.W. Sheriff-Carter K. Moomaw J. Taylor I.L. Raymond J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO cells with the A3AR cDNA does not alter the steady-state levels of these proteins compared with non-transfected cells (Fig. 4C and data not shown). Therefore the 70% reduction in levels of Giα-3 represents a loss of approximately 0.4 pmol of Giα-3/mg of membrane protein. Assuming that 1 mol of β-subunits is down-regulated with 1 mol of G-protein α-subunit, the loss of 0.4 pmol/mg β-subunits would be undetectable since it represents a small proportion of the total pool of β-subunits. Therefore, additional β-subunits, not associated with the loss of Giα-3, must be down-regulated in order to account for the 60% loss measured by immunoblotting (Table I). This indicates that additional processes distinct from those involved in Giα-3 down-regulation are involved in regulating β-subunit expression. Such a scenario is also suggested by the distinct time courses displayed for down-regulation of each of these proteins (Fig. 8). The selective loss of Giα-3 over Giα-2 and Gq+11α-subunits despite their ability to each couple with activated A3ARs may be due to any of several reasons. While we are not able to quantitate the amount of Gq+11α-subunits expressed in CHO cell membranes, it is possible that large molar excesses of Giα-2 or Gq+11α-subunits over Giα-3 mask an equivalent down-regulation such that it is not detectable: for example, a molar reduction in levels of Giα-2 equivalent to that of Giα-3 (0.4 pmol/mg membrane protein) would represent less than 10% of the total pool of Giα-2 and would probably not be detected by immunoblotting. Also, the importance of receptor/G-protein stoichiometry in determining extent of down-regulation has not been thoroughly examined, although a recent study on cell lines expressing different levels of β2-adrenergic receptor has suggested that increasing the receptor:G-protein ratio enhances observation of agonist-mediated down-regulation of Gsα-subunits(40Adie E.J. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, if a receptor couples to more than one G-protein with equal efficiency, it is most likely that the least abundant G-protein would be more susceptible to down-regulation. In conclusion, we have assessed the ability of the A3AR to activate and regulate specific Gi proteins in a transfected CHO cell system. The A3AR is capable of activating both Giα-2 and Giα-3, the two pertussis toxin substrates expressed in CHO cells, as well as Gq+11α-subunits. Moreover, sustained exposure of A3AR-expressing cells to agonist results in the selective down-regulation of Giα-3 and G-protein β-subunits but not of Giα-2, Gsα, or Gq+11α-subunits. However, the extent to which both of these proteins are down-regulated and the differing time courses exhibited suggest that distinct processes may be involved in regulating the levels of these proteins in response to receptor activation. Whatever these mechanisms are, we have clearly shown that while the A3AR is capable of interacting with multiple G-proteins in a given cell type, agonist treatment specifically induces the down-regulation of Giα-3, thereby providing a potential mechanism for heterologous desensitization of hormone signaling events mediated by this G-protein. A3AR-transfected CHO cells were treated with or without 10 μM NECA for 24 hours at 37°C prior to membrane preparation and comparative immunoblotting using the antisera described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions, Gqα and G11α co-migrate and therefore the signal observed on immunoblots represents a composite signal for these proteins. Data are presented as means ± standard error from the number of experiments in parentheses, with the signal obtained for untreated control membranes set at 100%. We thank Dr. Mark Olah for donating the A3AR-transfected cell line used in this study, Dr. John Raymond for generously supplying AA-[32P]GTP, and Linda Scherich for preparation of the manuscript."

We have also demonstrated by hybridization analysis that copper amine oxidase genes are present in a range of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Copper amine oxidases (EC 1.4.3.6) have been identified in a wide range of microbial, plant, and animal systems (for reviews see 39McIntire W.S. Hartmann C. Davidson V.L.

In microbes they allow utilization of unusual amine substrates as nitrogen and/or carbon sources, whereas in plants and animals their functions are less clear. The copper amine oxidases catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of biogenic amines, including mono-, di-, and polyamines to the corresponding aldehyde with release of NH3 and H2O2. The pea seedling enzyme preferentially catalyzes oxidation of the diamine substrates putrescine (R = NH2(CH2)3) and cadaverine (R = NH2(CH2)4) at the primary amino group according to Reaction 1, Reaction 1 yielding 4-aminobutyraldehyde and 5-aminovaleraldehyde, respectively. This enzyme is relatively abundant comprising at least 0.1% total soluble protein in etiolated pea seedling epicotyls (37McGowan R.E. Muir R.M.

Di- and polyamines are also present within the apoplast, and the H2O2 formed by their oxidation may be important in lignosuberization and cross-linking of extracellular macromolecules such as extensins, both during normal growth and in response to stress and wounding (18Federico R.

The copper amine oxidases are homodimers of subunit size approximately 70-95 kDa depending on the source. Each subunit contains one Cu(II) and a quinone cofactor (for review see 31Klinman J.P.

We are interested in the biological functions of plant copper amine oxidases, and we report here the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the pea seedling amine oxidase gene. Important discrepancies between the translated pea and corresponding lentil sequence (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) are considered, and a corrected lentil sequence is presented. The implications of this revision for interpretation of comparative amino acid sequence alignments to highlight important residues are discussed. We have also examined the level of glycosylation of pea seedling amine oxidase. Finally, we demonstrate the presence of copper amine oxidase gene homologs in a range of plant species. E. coli strain LE 392 (supE44, supF58, hsdR514, galK2, galT22, metB1, trpR55, lacY1) was used as host for cDNA library screening, and DH1 (supE44, hsdR17, recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA1) was used for routine plasmid growth. A 10-μg sample of pea seedling amine oxidase, kindly provided by Professor D. M. Dooley (Montana State University), was coupled to p-phenylene diisothiocyanate glass and was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation. Released amino acids were assigned following high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase analysis against suitable standards. Amino acid sequencing was performed by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council protein microsequencing facility in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds. Routine DNA manipulations were performed according to 49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Restriction endonuclease, ligase, and DNA polymerase reactions were performed in the buffers and under the conditions recommended by their manufacturers. PCR fragments were cloned into the pCR vector according to the protocols supplied with the TA cloning system (Invitrogen). A cDNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from 6-day-old etiolated pea seedlings with a Stratagene cDNA synthesis kit was a gift from Dr. D. Bucke (Schering Agrochemicals Ltd.). The cDNA was cloned into EcoRI/XhoI digested Uni-ZAP (Stratagene) to give a library of 1.5 × 106 independent clones, which was amplified to a titer of 3.8 × 1011 plaque-forming units/ml. Eight- to 10-day postgermination lentil and pea etiolated seedlings were dissected and the epicotyls frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −70°C. Frozen tissue was powdered in liquid N2 using a pestle and mortar, and mRNA was isolated using a Pharmacia Microprep reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was prepared from poly(A)+ RNA with a Pharmacia first-strand cDNA synthesis kit using either a 5′-tailed oligo(dT) primer (Pharmacia) or a sequence specific primer. PCR primers were designed to amplify the lentil seedling amine oxidase cDNA coding region (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for use as a heterologous probe to screen the pea cDNA library. The PCR mix contained 100 pg of lentil cDNA, 100 pmol (2 μM) of each primer (5′-TTTACACCATTGCATACTCAACATC-3′) and (5′-CCACACAGCCAAAGTATCGTCTCC-3′), and a 50 μM concentration of each dNTP in a 50-μl reaction. The reaction mix was overlaid with 50 μl of mineral oil and subjected to a “hot-start” by adding 1 unit of SuperTaq (HT Biotechnology) during the last minute of the initial 5-min denaturation (94°C) step. Amplification was achieved by 30 cycles of 94°C, 1 min; 55°C for 1 min; 72°C for 3 min. The reaction products were separated through a 1.5% NuSieve agarose gel (FMC), and a DNA band of the expected size of 1.74 kilobase pairs was recovered. Phage dilutions were plated on LE392 to give 15,000 plaques/9-cm-diameter plate. Duplicate plaque lifts were taken onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 30-ng aliquot of the lentil seedling amine oxidase fragment in NuSieve agarose was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random hexamer labeling (20Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal.

The membranes were prehybridized at 56°C for 4 h in 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4· H2O, 1 mM Na2 EDTA, pH 7.4), 6% polyethylene glycol, 0.5% skimmed milk powder (Marvel), 1% SDS, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, and 250 μg/ml sonicated and denatured calf thymus DNA (22Gurr S.J. McPherson M.J. Gurr S.J. McPherson M.J. Bowles D.J. in Molecular Plant Pathology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 109-121Google Scholar). Hybridization at 56°C was performed overnight in the same buffer after the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The membranes were finally washed in 0.1% SSC (1 × SSC, 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Positive plaques were purified by successive rounds of screening at lower plaque densities. cDNA clones were rescued as pBluescript SK(-) plasmids by in vivo excision from Uni-ZAP as detailed by Stratagene. DNA sequence analysis was performed with Sequenase V2.0 kits (Amersham) with product analysis on 6% wedge gels. Initial sequencing reactions were performed using vector-specific T3 and T7 primers and degenerate primers. Forward and reverse orientation primers (primers a and b, respectively) were designed by back-translation of the amino acid sequence of the TPQ-containing peptide (41Mu D. Janes S.M. Smith A.J. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7979-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These primers were designed prior to the definitive identification of Tyr as the residue modified to TPQ (41Mu D. Janes S.M. Smith A.J. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7979-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so included coding potential for both Tyr and Phe at the codon corresponding to the TPQ site. Primer c was designed from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mature pea seedling amine oxidase determined during the course of the present study. The primer a sequence was 5′-GTI GGI AA(TC) T(TA) (TC) GA(TC) AA(TC) GT-3′. The primer b sequence was 5′-ATI AC(AG) TT(AG) TC(AG) (AT)A(AG) TT(AGCT) CC-3′. The primer c sequence was 5′-CA(TC) GTI CA(GA) CA(TC) CCI (TC)T-3′. Parentheses indicate degenerate positions. A progressive sequencing strategy was used with design of further primers to complete the sequence of both strands of the cDNA insert. Sequence data were compiled and analyzed on a MicroVax 3600 computer using 55Staden R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar software. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALV and SOMAP (25Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar; 43Parry-Smith D.J. Attwood T.K. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 233-235PubMed Google Scholar). Lentil cDNA clones were sequenced in a similar manner using primers selected from the pea seedling sequencing project. Genomic DNAs were prepared from lentil and pea according the method of 14Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6355) Google Scholar with additional purification by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNAs from barley, rice, soybean, sugar beet, tomato, vine, wheat, and Arabidopsis were kindly provided by Claire Scollan, Yi Li, and Ruth Turnbull (Centre for Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Leeds). Ten-μg aliquots of DNA were digested with restriction enzymes according to the manufacturer's recommendations and were separated through a 1% agarose gel (15 × 20 cm) by electrophoresis at 1.5 V/cm for 16 h before transfer to Hybond N+, followed by prehybridization and hybridization as described for the cDNA library screen. The filter was successively washed in 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 56°C; then 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C; and finally in 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C with autoradiographic exposure between each wash. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from 6-day-old etiolated pea and lentil epicotyl tissue using a Pharmacia Microprep reagent kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA was electrophoresed at 5 V/cm in a 1% agarose, 1 × MOPS (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) gel containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and ethidium bromide together with 0.24-9.5-kilobase RNA markers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The gel was capillary blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane and fixed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was prehybridized in 5 × Denhardt's, 6 × SSC, 100 μg/ml sonicated and denatured calf thymus DNA at 65°C overnight and hybridized overnight under the same conditions with a pea seedling amine oxidase cDNA random hexamer-labeled probe prepared as described previously. The membrane was washed to 0.1 × SSC, 0.1 × SDS at 65°C before autoradiography. Protein samples of approximately 1 mg were denatured by boiling for 5 min and were then deglycosylated with N-glycosidase in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 37°C for 16 h. Control reactions containing no N-glycosidase were also performed. Proteins were analyzed on 0.1% SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Hames, 1981). Of 150,000 plaques of the cDNA library screened, 102 gave positive hybridization signals after the primary screen using a radiolabeled lentil amine oxidase gene probe (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several clones were taken through two further rounds of screening, and pBluescript clones were rescued from Uni-ZAP by in vivo excision. One clone, pPSAO1, contained an insert of 2.3 kilobases which probably represents a full-length cDNA based on three lines of experimental evidence. First, Northern analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from 8-10-day-old pea and lentil seedlings reveal a single transcript of approximately 2.3 kilobases (data not shown). Second, rescreening of the cDNA library with a 740-base pair fragment from the 5′-proximal half of the pPSAO1 insert (bases 490-1230) failed to identify clones with inserts longer than that of pPSAO1. Finally, PCR screening of the cDNA library with a vector primer and internal PSAO-specific primers failed to amplify any sequences longer than those amplified from pPSAO1. The DNA sequence of the cDNA insert in pPSAO1 is shown in Fig. 1 and was determined for both strands using a progressive primer design strategy. A long open reading frame extends from position 74 to 2098 (Fig. 1), and the translated amino acid sequence shows good overall homology with the published lentil amine oxidase cDNA sequence (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The identity of the translated pea seedling amine oxidase was confirmed by comparison with two regions of peptide sequence data. First, the amino acid sequence of the TPQ-containing peptide determined by 41Mu D. Janes S.M. Smith A.J. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7979-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar matches a region of coding sequence between 1298 and 1331 (Fig. 1). X indicates an unassigned residue which corresponds to Tyr387, the residue proposed to form the TPQ cofactor. In the lentil sequence this residue is found at an identical position in the polypeptide chain (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Second, the N-terminal region of pea seedling amine oxidase was determined to be X-T-P-L-H-V-Q-H-P-L-D. This latter sequence matches the amino acids encoded by bases 149-181 (Fig. 1), and the unassigned residue (X) can be identified as valine. This region of amino acid sequence does not correspond to the start of the open reading frame but is preceded by a putative signal sequence of 25 residues with characteristics expected of a secretion signal (62von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3694) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with evidence that amine oxidase is an extracellular enzyme in the Leguminoseae (Federico and Angelini, 1986; 19Federico R. Alisi C. Angelini R. Crane F.L. Morre D.J. Low H. Plasma Membrane Oxidoreductases in Control of Animal and Plant Growth. Plenum Press, New York1988: 333-337Crossref Google Scholar; Slocum and Furey, 1991). It also agrees with the interpretation of the lentil cDNA sequence (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although in this case the start of the open reading frame was not present. The ATG codon at nucleotides 74-76 (Fig. 1) most probably represents the amine oxidase translation initiation site. It should be noted that a second in-frame ATG (position 92-96; Fig. 1) occurs six codons into the coding region and could represent the translation start site. However, in eukaryotes the first ATG encountered by the translation machinery is usually selected as the initiation site. The sequence context of the first ATG (CTCACGATGGCT) matches well the consensus translation start site (TAAACAATGGCT) defined by 30Joshi C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6643-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar for plant genes. Although polyadenylation signals are less well defined for plant than for mammalian genes, the 3′-untranslated region contains two potential polyadenylation signals. The first (2152-2157; Fig. 1) exactly matches the AATAAA consensus; however, the second AATGAA (2223-2228; Fig. 1) lies only 21 residues from the poly(A) tail. It seems likely that this second signal represents a near-upstream element associated with polyadenylation of the 3′-end of the mRNA (27Hunt A.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 47-60Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) Multiple sequence alignment of amine oxidase protein sequences by 63Zhang X. Fuller J.H. McIntire W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5617-5627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar revealed the lentil sequence to be significantly shorter at the C-terminal end than any other amine oxidase. Since the lentil diamine oxidase sequence was the first of plant origin to be reported, this difference in length suggested some functional significance. However, the sequence of the pea seedling amine oxidase, presented here, contradicts this view. Over the first 555 residues of the mature plant proteins there is very good sequence conservation between the pea and lentil sequences with only 30 amino acid differences, many of which are conservative changes. The region corresponding to residues 474-478 (-G-S-S-K-R-; Fig. 1) is not a good match, and there is an extra amino acid in the pea seedling sequence in this region compared with the lentil sequence (-E-V-Q-E-). More significantly, the predicted lentil mature protein contains 569 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 64.3 kDa (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas the pea protein has 649 residues and a calculated molecular mass of 73.7 kDa. This represents a difference in length of 80 amino acids. One residue difference occurs within coding region around amino acid 476 as discussed above, but the extra 79 amino acids in the pea protein represent a major difference between the C-terminal ends of the two polypeptide chains. Such a gross difference in size seemed surprising given the phylogenetic similarity of the two plants: both Leguminoseae, the similar physiological and biochemical properties of the two enzymes, and the good sequence identity within the rest of the coding regions. To investigate these differences further we first resequenced the pea seedling amine oxidase gene from a second clone, but this proved to be identical to the original sequence determination. We then isolated mRNA from lentil seedlings and prepared cDNA. Using pea gene sequencing primers we PCR amplified the region of the lentil amine oxidase gene corresponding to nucleotides 179-2149 (Fig. 1). The PCR fragment was cloned into the pCR vector (Invitrogen) and was sequenced. Only a limited number of differences was identified between this lentil sequence and that of 48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar; nonetheless, the differences are very important, as shown in Fig. 2. The most significant of the differences were several single base insertions and a deletion which had the effect of altering, several times, the reading frame for the encoded protein. Three independent insertions lead to frameshift alterations in the region encoding residues 474-478 (positions 1568-1582; Fig. 1) and result in a sequence with strong identity to the pea gene including the presence of the “missing” residue. Most significant are insertions of a C at the positions corresponding to nucleotides 1814 and 1859 in the pea sequence (Fig. 1) and deletion of a G which occurs in the lentil sequence between nucleotides 2033 and 2034 in the pea sequence (Fig. 1). These result in a sequence that matches the pea seedling amine oxidase sequence by extending the lentil coding region to encode a mature protein of 649 amino acids, identical in size to the pea protein. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of part of the revised (this study) and the previous (48Rossi A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi Agr A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) lentil amine oxidase cDNA sequence, highlighting the observed differences and the consequences for the protein coding region. In the pea sequence there are four potential N-glycosylation sites (N-X-S/T where X is any residue) at amino acids 131, 334, 364, and 558. Three of these sites are also found in the corrected lentil sequence at 131, 364, and 558; however, the site at 334 is a D-G-T in lentil. On the basis of hydropathy profiles Rossi et al.(1992) proposed that the site at 364 would be unlikely to be modified, leaving two potential sites at 131 and 558. We analyzed the extent of glycosylation in pea seedling amine oxidase and compared this with the porcine plasma amine oxidase, a protein known to be extensively N-glycosy"

INTRODUCTIONFibrillar collagens (types I, II, III) are synthesized as precursors (procollagens) formed by a central triple-helical collagen domain extended by propeptides both at the carboxyl and amino extremities. During the processing of procollagen to collagen, the carboxyl and amino propeptides are cleaved by specific proteinases. The procollagen C-proteinase removes the carboxyl propeptide of types I, II, and III procollagens(1Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol.

It is, however, not established if the multimeric association is required for a full catalytic activity or if only one of the proteins carries most of the enzymatic properties. The association of the enzyme with other proteins in vivo is suggested by experiments showing that it is immobilized on extracellular matrix macromolecules rather than being free in the extracellular fluids or attached to cell membranes(12Goffin C. Goebels Y. Mol. Biol. 1992; 11: 203-212Google Scholar).In the present study, we have identified and characterized a 107-kDa form of PCI-NP from bovine skin, which displays a full enzymatic activity. A specific binding of PCI-NP to type XIV collagen was also demonstrated.DISCUSSIONA type I procollagen N-proteinase (PCI-NP) presenting a 107-kDa apparent molecular mass was purified from fetal calf skin. After six major purification steps, about 25 μg of enzyme were isolated from 250 g of tissue with a recovery of 16% based on enzymatic activity. The purified enzyme was extensively characterized. It specifically cleaved native pN-collagen type I and did not process pN-collagen type III. It was also unable to cleave and to degrade denatured pN-collagen type I, pN-α1 propeptide, type I collagen, or type XIV collagen. Amino acid sequencing of the carboxyl end of the amino propeptide of the α1 chain demonstrated that the 107-kDa PCI-NP cleaved the Pro-Gln bond reported to be cleaved during the processing of pro-α1 I polypeptide (9).The kinetic properties of the enzyme such as the activation energy (17,000 cal mol-1), the Km, and the turnover number of the enzyme (237 nM and 430 h-1, respectively, at 35°C, 0.2 M NaCl, and pH 7.2) were similar to values reported by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C. Rafi N. Romanic A.M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11389-11390Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, a major difference exists between these two enzymatic preparations. Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C. Rafi N.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described the extensive purification from bovine or chicken leg tendons of a 500-kDa enzyme, as determined by gel filtration, formed by the association of 4-6 different subunits, some of them exhibiting catalytic activity. A minor 300-kDa partially degraded form was also observed. By contrast, we purified from fetal calf skin an enzyme with an apparent molecular mass estimated at about 130 kDa by gel filtration. In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis of active fractions collected from three different chromatographic columns revealed that one band with an apparent molecular mass of 107 kDa (reduced) varied always proportionally to PCI-NP activity, while other polypeptides present in the preparations had a different pattern of elution that did not coincide with enzyme activity. These data suggest that the fully active enzyme consists in a single protein of 107 kDa, a size close to what was observed for the 102-kDa procollagen C-proteinase (1Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than in a complex of polypeptides as suggested by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C. Rafi N. Romanic A.M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11389-11390Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 11Hojima Y. McKenzie J.A. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this difference is not clear, but the use of an affinity chromatography in our procedure could have improved purification by removing tissue proteins displaying affinity for PCI-NP. We hypothesize that the 90-kDa subunit (unreduced) from the 500-kDa complex prepared by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C.

As for most of the secreted proteins, the amino-terminal amino acid of PCI-NP was blocked and could not be subjected to an amino-terminal sequence analysis by Edman degradation. To overcome this problem, internal peptides of membrane-bound enzyme were produced and analyzed. An unambiguous sequence of 14 amino acids in length was determined and used to screen proteins and nucleic acid data banks. No significant homology was found, suggesting that PCI-NP was not cloned or sequenced so far, even as an unidentified protein.One crucial point in this work was to produce a monoclonal antibody that could be used for immunopurification of PCI-NP. About 3000 hybridomas were produced from mice immunized with a semi-purified enzymatic preparation, but only one of them secreted a monoclonal antibody able to immunoprecipitate PCI-NP activity. This antibody, however, was not directed toward the enzyme itself but recognized a protein on which the enzyme was bound. This binding protein was determined to be type XIV collagen by various techniques, including SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, analysis of amino acid composition, and partial microsequencing. The nature of the interaction between PCI-NP and type XIV collagen was investigated. This binding is highly specific since excess amounts of irrelevant proteins (0.1% BSA or 1% fetal calf serum) did not alter the interaction. It was also strongly dependent upon ionic conditions. Small increases of pH or salt concentration, as well as traces of ionic detergent (0.0001% SDS), prevented the binding of PCI-NP on type XIV collagen. By contrast, non-ionic detergents at concentrations as high as 3% had essentially no effect. Since extraction of PCI-NP from calf skin was also strongly dependent upon ionic conditions and not affected by non-ionic detergents,2 2A. Colige, Y. Goebels, B. V. Nusgens, and C. M. Lapière, personal observation. this suggests that type XIV collagen might be a physiological ligand for PCI-NP in vivo. The exact function of type XIV collagen is not completely elucidated. In vivo, it is associated with type I collagen fibers via direct or indirect interactions(17Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J.

Here, we propose another role for type XIV collagen that would be to immobilize PCI-NP in a close vicinity of type I collagen fibers, allowing the processing and the subsequent polymerization of the newly synthesized molecules under a strict spatial control.Different modules present in the NC-3 domain of the XIV collagen are potential binding sites. Among them, the tsp1 module (or NC-4-like domain) was carefully studied(20Moradi-Améli M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This module, first described in thrombospondin, is also found in FACIT collagens (types IX, XII, XIV) and in some fibrillar collagens (α1 V, α1 XI, α2 XI). It is characterized by a β-stranded structure also observed in proteins that are involved in molecular recognition and that exert adhesion or binding functions such as Ig-related molecules(20Moradi-Améli M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine which module is really involved in the binding of PCI-NP, we are currently developing monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of type XIV collagen. The hypothesis to test will be that these collagens, expressed in different tissues at variable levels(21van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), could have binding properties for PCI-NP and eventually for other enzymes involved in the extracellular processing of procollagen molecules such as, for example, lysyl oxidase or type III procollagen N-proteinase.The results presented in this study clearly indicate that we have isolated a fully active procollagen I N-proteinase (PCI-NP) of 107 kDa. An amino acid sequence was determined that will be useful for the cloning of the cDNA.

A specific binding of PCI-NP to type XIV collagen was also demonstrated. DISCUSSIONA type I procollagen N-proteinase (PCI-NP) presenting a 107-kDa apparent molecular mass was purified from fetal calf skin. After six major purification steps, about 25 μg of enzyme were isolated from 250 g of tissue with a recovery of 16% based on enzymatic activity. The purified enzyme was extensively characterized. It specifically cleaved native pN-collagen type I and did not process pN-collagen type III. It was also unable to cleave and to degrade denatured pN-collagen type I, pN-α1 propeptide, type I collagen, or type XIV collagen. Amino acid sequencing of the carboxyl end of the amino propeptide of the α1 chain demonstrated that the 107-kDa PCI-NP cleaved the Pro-Gln bond reported to be cleaved during the processing of pro-α1 I polypeptide (9).The kinetic properties of the enzyme such as the activation energy (17,000 cal mol-1), the Km, and the turnover number of the enzyme (237 nM and 430 h-1, respectively, at 35°C, 0.2 M NaCl, and pH 7.2) were similar to values reported by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y.

A minor 300-kDa partially degraded form was also observed. By contrast, we purified from fetal calf skin an enzyme with an apparent molecular mass estimated at about 130 kDa by gel filtration. In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis of active fractions collected from three different chromatographic columns revealed that one band with an apparent molecular mass of 107 kDa (reduced) varied always proportionally to PCI-NP activity, while other polypeptides present in the preparations had a different pattern of elution that did not coincide with enzyme activity. These data suggest that the fully active enzyme consists in a single protein of 107 kDa, a size close to what was observed for the 102-kDa procollagen C-proteinase (1Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) rather than in a complex of polypeptides as suggested by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M.

The reason for this difference is not clear, but the use of an affinity chromatography in our procedure could have improved purification by removing tissue proteins displaying affinity for PCI-NP. We hypothesize that the 90-kDa subunit (unreduced) from the 500-kDa complex prepared by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C.

We hypothesize that the 90-kDa subunit (unreduced) from the 500-kDa complex prepared by Hojima et al.(10Hojima Y. Mörgelin M.M. Engel J. Boutillon M-M. van der Rest M. McKenzie J.A. Chen G.-C.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11336-11345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponds to our PCI-NP (84 kDa, unreduced), while the other polypeptides in this complex represent PCI-NP-bound proteins as we observed it with type XIV collagen (see below). An amino acid sequence analysis was performed using electrophoretically purified enzyme. As for most of the secreted proteins, the amino-terminal amino acid of PCI-NP was blocked and could not be subjected to an amino-terminal sequence analysis by Edman degradation. To overcome this problem, internal peptides of membrane-bound enzyme were produced and analyzed. An unambiguous sequence of 14 amino acids in length was determined and used to screen proteins and nucleic acid data banks. No significant homology was found, suggesting that PCI-NP was not cloned or sequenced so far, even as an unidentified protein. One crucial point in this work was to produce a monoclonal antibody that could be used for immunopurification of PCI-NP. About 3000 hybridomas were produced from mice immunized with a semi-purified enzymatic preparation, but only one of them secreted a monoclonal antibody able to immunoprecipitate PCI-NP activity. This antibody, however, was not directed toward the enzyme itself but recognized a protein on which the enzyme was bound. This binding protein was determined to be type XIV collagen by various techniques, including SDS-gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, analysis of amino acid composition, and partial microsequencing. The nature of the interaction between PCI-NP and type XIV collagen was investigated. This binding is highly specific since excess amounts of irrelevant proteins (0.1% BSA or 1% fetal calf serum) did not alter the interaction. It was also strongly dependent upon ionic conditions. Small increases of pH or salt concentration, as well as traces of ionic detergent (0.0001% SDS), prevented the binding of PCI-NP on type XIV collagen. By contrast, non-ionic detergents at concentrations as high as 3% had essentially no effect. Since extraction of PCI-NP from calf skin was also strongly dependent upon ionic conditions and not affected by non-ionic detergents,2 2A. Colige, Y. Goebels, B. V. Nusgens, and C. M. Lapière, personal observation. this suggests that type XIV collagen might be a physiological ligand for PCI-NP in vivo. The exact function of type XIV collagen is not completely elucidated. In vivo, it is associated with type I collagen fibers via direct or indirect interactions(17Brown J.C. Mann K. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Wälchli C. Kosh M. Chiquet M. Odermatt B.F. Trueb B. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25015-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the current hypothesis is that it could be involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix assembly. Here, we propose another role for type XIV collagen that would be to immobilize PCI-NP in a close vicinity of type I collagen fibers, allowing the processing and the subsequent polymerization of the newly synthesized molecules under a strict spatial control. Different modules present in the NC-3 domain of the XIV collagen are potential binding sites. Among them, the tsp1 module (or NC-4-like domain) was carefully studied(20Moradi-Améli M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This module, first described in thrombospondin, is also found in FACIT collagens (types IX, XII, XIV) and in some fibrillar collagens (α1 V, α1 XI, α2 XI). It is characterized by a β-stranded structure also observed in proteins that are involved in molecular recognition and that exert adhesion or binding functions such as Ig-related molecules(20Moradi-Améli M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine which module is really involved in the binding of PCI-NP, we are currently developing monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of type XIV collagen. The hypothesis to test will be that these collagens, expressed in different tissues at variable levels(21van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), could have binding properties for PCI-NP and eventually for other enzymes involved in the extracellular processing of procollagen molecules such as, for example, lysyl oxidase or type III procollagen N-proteinase. The results presented in this study clearly indicate that we have isolated a fully active procollagen I N-proteinase (PCI-NP) of 107 kDa. An amino acid sequence was determined that will be useful for the cloning of the cDNA. We also described binding properties of type XIV collagen for PCI-NP, suggesting a new role for this collagen and perhaps for other FACIT collagens in vivo. Activity was determined under standard reaction conditions and expressed in cpm of cleaved substrate. ND, not determined. Kinetic studies were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Km and Vmax were calculated according to the Lineweaver-Burk plot and the least squares test methods and confirmed by the direct Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (14) plot. Values in the table represent the mean of values ± S.D. obtained in three separate experiments, except for the 15°C condition performed only once. The study was performed as described for Table II except that pH was adjusted to 7.2 or 8.3 and the NaCl concentration to 0.2 or 0.4 M. About 250 ng of PCI-NP immobilized on PVDF membrane were hydrolyzed during 24 h at 106°C in 6 N HCl. Analysis of the PTC-derivatives was performed on a 420A analyzer (ABI). Seven individual peptides peaks specific of PCI-NP were sequenced. The main sequences are given in the one-letter code on the first line and in bold if unambiguously identified. Other sequences found during the analysis are given below. An ∗ indicates that the background in this cycle was too high to make any assignment for this residue.

Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Transcription of primary response genes is induced through signal transduction cascades that activate latent, pre-existing transcription factors. Many primary response genes (e.g. jun, fos, myc, egr-1/TIS8) encode transcription factors that function intracellularly in growth control and cellular differentiation. Others encode proteins involved in paracrine intercellular communication.

These examples suggested to us that glucocorticoid attenuation may distinguish a functional subclass of primary response genes involved in intercellular communication. We hypothesized that TIS10/PGS2, iNOS, JE/MCP-1, and KC/gro are representative of a larger class of primary response genes whose induction by mitogens, growth factors, or inflammatory stimuli is attenuated by glucocorticoids. We refer to such genes as glucocorticoid-attenuated response genes, or GARGs. We also hypothesized that GARGs predominantly encode proteins whose functions are extracellular or intercellular, rather than intracellular. To test our proposals, we screened 15,000 clones of a cDNA library by differential hybridization, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the inducer and dexamethasone (DEX) as the glucocorticoid. The characteristics of the 12 distinct GARG cDNAs we identified support both hypotheses: five GARG cDNAs are previously undescribed sequences; and of the seven previously known sequences, six encode secreted products with known functions in intercellular communication. One of the five novel GARG cDNAs we cloned encodes a new member of the CXC chemokine family, which we designated LIX, for LPS-induced CXC chemokine. Cycloheximide, dexamethasone, and phenol-extracted lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coliserotype 0111:B4 were purchased from Sigma; cell culture media from Mediatech (Washington, D. C.); fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Gemini Bioproducts (Calabasas, CA); restriction enzymes from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); custom oligonucleotides from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA); and [α-32P]dCTP from DuPont NEN. Recombinant TGF-β1 was a gift of A. Purchio (Bristol Myers/Squibb, Seattle, WA). Murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured at 37°C in 10% CO2, air in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Near-confluent cultures were switched to medium containing 0.5% FBS for 18-24 h before treatment with dexamethasone, TGF-β1, LPS, or serum. These agents were added directly to the culture medium. Mouse embryo fibroblasts were isolated from strain 129 embryos and cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum as described(11Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Kujubu D.A. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 5% CO2, air in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. Mice used in experiments reported in this paper were maintained and handled in accordance with institutional guidelines. C57B/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were given intraperitoneal injections with LPS or sterile saline and 4 h later were anesthetized with ether and killed by cervical dislocation. Poly(A)+ RNA for library construction and synthesis of cDNA probes was extracted directly from cell lysates using biotinylated poly(dT) and streptavidin-coupled paramagnetic beads (PolyATtract® kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Total cellular RNA for Northern analysis was isolated with guanidinium isothiocyanate(12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), subjected to electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to charged nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) as described(13Kujubu D.A.

Prehybridizations and hybridizations with 32P-labeled probes were performed at 42°C in 50% formamide, 0.65 M NaCl, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, and 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Filters were washed at 65°C in 0.5% SDS and 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) or in 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC. Filter autoradiograms were made by exposing XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80°C with one intensifying screen. Radioactivity of specific bands was directly quantitated and analyzed using a multiwire proportional counter system (Ambis Inc., San Diego, CA). Corrections for small variations in loading of each lane were made using radioactivity of the message for the constitutive ribosomal protein S2 (CHOb). For library preparation, quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells were pretreated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h before addition of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and either FBS (final concentration 20%) or LPS (10 ng/ml). Cells were harvested 2 and 4 h later. Two poly(A)+ RNA preparations were utilized in the synthesis of the library. One was purified from the combined 2 and 4 h lysates of LPS-treated cells, and the other from the combined 2 and 4 h lysates of serum-treated cells. These two poly(A)+ RNA preparations were used separately as templates for oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA synthesis, using the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After second strand synthesis and size fractionation to exclude cDNAs shorter than 500 bp, equal quantities of the two cDNA preparations were combined, directionally ligated into the λ ZAP II vector, and packaged with Gigapack II Gold (Stratagene). The primary library, which contained 2.9 × 106 plaques (95% recombinants), was amplified once to a titer of 2.3 × 1013 plaque-forming units/ml. Using probes described in previous studies(3Gilbert R.S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C.

Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar), we isolated phage containing inserts for TIS10/PGS2, iNOS, S2, and egr-1/TIS8 to serve as controls in the differential screening. Poly(A)+ RNA preparations used to prepare probes for differential hybridization were obtained from three groups of Swiss 3T3 cells. Cells for the “plus” probe were pretreated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 1 h before addition of 10 ng/ml LPS. Cells for the “minus” probe were pretreated with 2 μM dexamethasone for 3 h before addition of 10 ng/ml LPS. Both groups of cells were harvested after 2 h of continued incubation, along with untreated cells (the third group). 32P-Labeled cDNA probes were synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) using both oligo(dT)12-18 and random hexamer primers (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Phage from the cDNA library were plated at a density of ≅1900 clones on eight 150 mm Petri dishes. Purified phage for S2, TIS10, and iNOS were spotted at known locations on each plate to serve as controls. After overnight growth of the phage, quadruplicate transfers to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) were made from each plate, with the filters applied sequentially for 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 min. After air drying, the filters were vacuum-baked at 80°C for 1-2 h and then preincubated in sealed plastic bags for 2-4 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 6 × Denhardt's reagent, 6 × SSC, 60 mM NaPO4 (pH 6.8), 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 145 μg/ml rATP, and 60 μg/ml sonicated nondenatured salmon sperm DNA. Equal counts of 32P-labeled cDNA probes from the plus, minus, and uninduced control cells were added to bags containing the first, second, and third lifts, respectively, and hybridized at 42°C for 4 days. The fourth lift was hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled probes made by random priming from purified inserts for TIS10/PGS2 and iNOS cDNAs. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC + 0.5% SDS at room temperature and then at 60°C, with a final wash in 0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Autoradiogram exposures of the plus, minus, and control filters were adjusted when necessary to provide equal signal intensity of the S2 control phage spots. Plaques were chosen as candidates if they showed greater hybridization signal on the plus filter as compared with both the minus and control filters on at least two sets of autoradiograms exposed for different times. The fourth lift was used to identify and eliminate phage for TIS10/PGS2 or iNOS. After plaque purification, selected phage containing cloned inserts were converted to Bluescript plasmids by in vivo excision using Exassist helper phage and the SOLR strain of E. coli (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Plaque-purified candidate phage were replated once, picked into 1 ml of water with 25 μl of chloroform, and stored frozen at −20°C. After thawing and refreezing twice, a 25-μl aliquot was heated to 95°C for 5 min and then used as template for the PCR in a total volume of 50 μL, with 2.5 units of Ampli-Taq polymerase and the supplied buffer (Perkin-Elmer), dNTP concentrations of 200 and 1 μM each of the primers 5′-CGGGCTGCAGGAATTC-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTT-3′. These primers were designed to hybridize just outside the 5′ end of the insert at the EcoRI cloning site and at the overlap of the poly(A) tail of the insert with the XhoI cloning site of λ Zap II, respectively(15Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, reactions were cycled 30 times (15 s at 94°C, 15 s at 48°C, 1 min at 72°C), with a final extension at 72°C for 15 min. Products with a single band on agarose gel or PhastGel (Pharmacia) electrophoresis were used as templates for random-primed labeling with 32P (Oligolabeling Kit, Pharmacia). If PCR was unsuccessful or resulted in multiple bands, probes were obtained by excision of the inserts from purified plasmids. Sequencing of double-stranded plasmids was performed at the Core DNA Sequencing Facility of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. Primers were designed using the Oligo program (National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN). Sequences were assembled and analyzed using the AssemblyLIGN and MacVector programs (International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT). Pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with TGF-β1 augments induction by LPS of both TIS10/PGS2 and iNOS(11Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Kujubu D.A. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Gilbert R.S. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We sought to utilize this effect to improve the sensitivity of screening for additional GARGs whose induction by LPS might be similarly enhanced by TGF-β1. We synthesized a cDNA library from poly(A)+-RNA extracted from murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts pretreated with TGF-β1 and stimulated for 2 or 4 h with either LPS or serum. Cycloheximide was included during stimulation, so that only primary response genes would be induced. We screened this cDNA library by differential hybridization, using a plus cDNA probe synthesized from 3T3 cells treated with both LPS and TGF-β1 and a minus probe from cells treated with LPS and dexamethasone. Dexamethasone-suppressed cDNAs not induced by LPS and/or TGF-β1 were eliminated by also requiring enhanced hybridization with the plus probe versus a third probe from untreated cells. TIS10/PGS2 and iNOS clones were identified with specific probes, and eliminated. Because the minus probe treatment did not include TGF-β1, our screen identified clones representing either (i) GARG cDNAs, i.e. LPS-induced, dexamethasone-attenuated messages whose induction by LPS might or might not be augmented by TGF-β1 or (ii) TGFβ-induced genes whose message levels are not affected by dexamethasone. We confirmed the differential expression of candidate clones and distinguished between the GARG and non-GARG cDNAs by Northern analysis. We screened 15,000 plaques and selected 120 GARG cDNA candidates. Forty-two phage demonstrating the greatest differences in hybridization were chosen for initial evaluation. By cross-hybridization with probes prepared by PCR from the cDNA inserts of the plaque-purified phage, the 42-candidate phage were reduced to 10 independent groups. Northern analysis confirmed that eight of these groups represented GARG cDNAs; the other two were not differentially expressed. The 78 remaining phage yielded six additional candidate groups. Northern analysis showed that four were GARG cDNAs, and two were TGF-β1-induced genes not affected by dexamethasone. Thus, the 14 independent cDNAs that satisfied the screening criteria included 12 GARG and two TGF-β1-induced non-GARG cDNAs. Sequences from the ends of the cDNAs were compared with nucleotide and protein data bases, using BLASTN and BLASTX(17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

We found that seven of the GARG cDNAs and the two TGF-β1-induced non-GARG cDNAs were known sequences; five of the GARG cDNAs had not been described previously (Table I).Table I:GARG and non-GARG cDNAs cloned in this study Open table in a new tab Six of the seven known GARG cDNAs encode secreted proteins that function in intercellular communication. GARG-6/TSP1 is thrombospondin-1, a secreted glycoprotein that modulates angiogenesis and is chemotactic for monocytes(19Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A.

GARG-42/cyr61 is a growth factor-inducible immediate early gene that encodes a member of a family of cysteine-rich secreted proteins that act as growth regulators(33O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 34Brunner A. Chinn J. Neubauer M. Purchio A.F.

The function of the seventh known GARG cDNA, GARG-49/IRG2, recently cloned from an LPS-stimulated macrophage cell line, is unknown(36Lee C.G. Demarquoy J. Jackson M.J. O'Brien W.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5758-5767PubMed Google Scholar). Five GARG cDNAs represent previously undescribed genes. GARG-8, which encodes a new CXC chemokine, is described below. GARG-16 and GARG-39 encode distinct proteins related to GARG-49/IRG2 and to two human interferon-inducible proteins of unknown function, IFI-56K and ISG-54K (30-32). Thus, among the GARG cDNAs are three related but distinct members of this family. Determination of the precise relationship of GARG-16, −39, and −49 to each other and to the human interferon-induced proteins awaits completion of sequencing. The remaining two GARG cDNAs encode LPS-inducible, dexamethasone-attenuated messages with no significant homology to any known genes. Message levels of all the GARGs are increased by LPS and attenuated by dexamethasone (Fig. 1 and 2). However, the GARG messages exhibit diverse responses to TGF-β1 or serum. TGF-β1 strongly induces most of the previously known GARGs (Fig. 1), but does not induce GARG-16, GARG-39, or GARG-49/IRG2. Serum is a potent inducer of GARG-6/TSP1, GARG-33/MCSF, and GARG-42/cyr61, but does not induce GARG-8/LIX, GARG-16, GARG-39, or GARG-49. The modulating effects of TGF-β1 on serum or LPS induction also vary for different GARGs. None of these GARGs exhibit the dramatic augmentation of induction seen with TIS10/PGS2 and iNOS(11Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Kujubu D.A. Xie W. Luner S. Herschman H.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Gilbert R.S. Herschman H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 380-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 modestly augments LPS induction of GARG-33/MCSF and GARG-34. In contrast, TGF-β1 attenuates LPS induction of GARG-8/LIX, GARG-10/crg2, GARG-16, GARG-39, and GARG-49/IRG2. Although induction of all the GARGs is attenuated by dexamethasone, the degree of attenuation varies. Dexamethasone almost completely suppresses LPS induction of GARG-10/crg2 (>95%), substantially suppresses LPS induction of GARG-8/LIX, GARG-13/JE, and GARG-17/MARC (75-80%) and modestly attenuates LPS induction of GARG-34, GARG-42/cyr61, and GARG-61 (30-50%). For several GARGs, dexamethasone attenuation varies with the inducer. Dexamethasone attenuates basal expression of GARG-6/TSP1 by 87%, attenuates TGF-β1 or LPS induction by 40-50%, but has a minimal effect (<10%) on serum induction. Similarly, dexamethasone attenuates LPS induction of GARG-42/cyr61 (55%) and GARG-61 (35%), attenuates their TGF-β1 induction (22-24%), but does not attenuate their serum induction. We cloned two cDNAs that are induced by TGF-β1, LPS, and serum but are not attenuated by dexamethasone (, Fig. 3). TGF-β1-induced non-GARG (TnG) cDNAs were an expected byproduct of our screening strategy: their induction by TGF-β1 plus LPS is greater than their induction by LPS plus dexamethasone, despite the absence of dexamethasone attenuation. Both of the TnG cDNAs we cloned encode products with intracellular functions. TnG-46/CEBPβ encodes the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β, a transcription factor also known as NF-IL6 and CRP2 (37-40). TnG-54 encodes β-actin, a cytoskeletal protein. Although β-actin message is abundant in unstimulated cells, its expression is increased by growth factor stimulation(41Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 42Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Getz M.J. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The GARG-8 cDNA sequence (Fig. 4) was derived from two independent clones among the 120 primary candidates. The original GARG-8 clone (nucleotides 13-1519 of the sequence in Fig. 4, followed by an 18-bp poly(A) tail) was completely sequenced on both strands. A second clone (GARG-8.36) included 12 additional bp at the 5′ end and a 120-bp poly(A) tail; it was sequenced on both strands through the coding region and on the lower strand at the 3′ end. The GARG-8 cDNA has a 396-bp open reading frame starting with ATG at nucleotide 66, which occurs in a context (CCACAATGA) favorable for initiation of transcription according to the Kozak rules(43Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar, 44Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). The predicted product, a 132-amino acid peptide of 14,189 daltons, includes a hydrophobic stretch of 12 amino acids (Met-22 through Leu-33) typical for a signal peptide(45Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 46von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), followed by a candidate signal peptidase cleavage site between alanines 40 and 41. The predicted mature peptide has a mass of 9852 daltons. The open reading frame is followed by a 1058-bp untranslated region that includes five ATTTA sequences (arrows in Fig. 4A) and a repetitive sequence (nucleotides 748-827) containing 40 repeats of AT or AG (region R in Fig. 4A). The 3′-untranslated region includes a segment with striking homology to sequences in other genes (region H in Fig. 4A), as discussed below. The polyadenylation signal AATAAA occurs at nucleotides 1499-1504. The predicted GARG-8 protein has four cysteines in positions characteristic of CXC chemokines (the first two being separated by one amino acid, Fig. 4) and shares substantial homology (26-54% identical residues) with known CXC chemokines (Fig. 5,). We propose the designation LPS-inducible CXC chemokine, or LIX, for this predicted cytokine. Alignments of the LIX mature peptide with its four closest relatives and a representative selection of other CXC sequences are shown in Fig. 5. The COOH-terminal region of LIX has a distinctive length and sequence. LIX extends 10-18 amino acids beyond the ends of all the other CXC chemokines except for the very distantly related MIG peptides (Table II). It should be noted that COOH-terminal lengths among CXC homologues in different species are quite similar.Table II:CXC chemokines: amino acid identities with LIX and C-terminal lengths Open table in a new tab The four CXC chemokines most similar to LIX are more closely related to each other than to LIX.

W.(1988) Acc. Chem. Res. 21, 333 -340) or to polarize a water molecule, which subsequently attacks the peptidyl bond (Mock, W. L., and Aksamawati, M.(1994) Biochem. J. 302, 57 -68). Site-directed mutagenesis techniques have been used to change this residue in the zinc endopeptidase from Bacillus stearothermophillus to either phenylalanine or alanine. At pH 7.0, the kcat/Km values of the substrate leucine enkephalin for the phenylalanine and alanine mutants were reduced by factors of 430- and 500-fold, respectively, as compared with the wild-type enzyme, mostly due to changes in kcat. In addition, the enzymatic activities of the mutant enzymes showed little pH dependence in the alkaline range, unlike the wild-type enzyme. The mutations did not greatly alter the binding affinities of inhibitors containing sulfydryl groups to chelate the active site zinc, while those of inhibitors containing hydroxamate or carboxylate zinc-chelating groups were increased between 80- and 250-fold. The largest change in the binding affinity of an inhibitor (>5 orders of magnitude) was found with the proposed transition state mimic, phosphoramidon. The results are generally in agreement with x-ray crystallography studies and favor the involvement of the active site histidine in transition state binding.

The closely related extracellular zinc endopeptidases (EC 3.4.24.27) produced by members of the bacterial genus Bacillus are thermostable, calcium-binding neutral proteases. Two of these enzymes, from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus (thermolysin) and Bacillus cereus, have been crystallized to a high resolution and shown to have virtually identical three-dimensional structures and active site geometries(1Pauptit R.A.

From molecular modelling studies, similar structures for other enzymes of the same group have been predicted, such as those secreted by Bacillus stearothermophillus(2Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput.

(Tokyo). 1993; 113: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). An active site model of the neutral proteases, derived from x-ray crystallographic studies of the binding of a variety of different inhibitors to thermolysin (for review, see Ref. 6), has found a wide application, as many mammalian zinc metallopeptidases, such as neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1), appear to have thermolysin-like active sites. The model has therefore formed the basis for the design of inhibitors of these physiologically important enzymes (for review, see Ref. 7). The bacterial enzymes are bilobal, and the active site, situated in a cleft between the two lobes, contains an atom of zinc bound with a tetracoordinate geometry to two histidines and a glutamate, with a water molecule providing the fourth ligand. The two histidines are found in a consensus sequence, HEXXH, present in the majority of zinc endo- and aminopeptidases(8Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). A large hydrophobic pocket in the P′1 position confers a preference for cleaving peptides at the N-terminal side of hydrophobic residues, and from the x-ray data it has been deduced that catalysis proceeds by a general base-type mechanism, with the zinc-bound water molecule being displaced toward the glutamate of the consensus sequence (Glu-143)1 1The amino acid numbering used throughout the article is that of thermolysin. by the incoming substrate. The resulting polarization of this water molecule then leads to an attack of the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond, with the negative charge that develops on the carbonyl group being stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed with both His-231 and Tyr-157 (Fig. 1A)(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). However, an alternative catalytic mechanism has recently been proposed, based on kinetic studies, in which His-231 acts initially as the general base that polarizes the attacking water molecule, with Glu-143 possibly playing a role in charge neutralization (Fig. 1B)(9Mock W.L.

B. subtilis DB117 was propagated at 37°C in LB broth or on tryptose blood agar base plates, containing 5 μg/ml erythromycin. B. subtilis DB117 containing pGE501, or one of its derivatives, was grown in the same media containing 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. In order to screen for protease activity by colony halo formation on Petri dishes, skimmed milk (1% (w/v)) was included in these media, solidified with 1.5% (w/v) agar. B. subtilis protoplasts were regenerated on DM3 plates(15Bron S. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Modern Microbiological Methods Series Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus.

E. coli were grown routinely on LB broth at 37°C with antibiotics, ampicillin, or chloramphenicol being added to final concentrations of 100 and 25 mg/ml, respectively, when required.

B. subtilis DB117 cells harboring the plasmid pGE501 were grown in LB broth containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 37°C, with shaking (180 rpm) for 16 h. Wild-type and mutated enzymes were purified from the culture supernatant by affinity chromatography using a column (1 × 4 cm) of Gly-D-Phe, coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin following the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, containing 5 mM CaCl2. The culture supernatant, obtained by centrifugation of the culture at 6000 × g for 10 min, was slowly adjusted to pH 5.5 and passed over the column at a flow rate of 3 ml/h. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer followed by the equilibration buffer containing 1 M NaCl, and the enzymes were finally eluted with 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5 mM CaCl2, 2.5 M NaCl, and 20% (v/v) propan-2-ol. All enzyme activities were stable in this buffer for several months when stored at −20°C. Enzyme purity was checked by SDS-PAGE using 12% slab gels. Protein concentration was determined following the method of Bradford(19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was normally assayed at 37°C in a total volume of 100 μl of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7. 0, containing 5 mM CaCl2, with 50 nM [3H]leucine enkephalin as a substrate(20Benchetrit T. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 M HCl and the metabolite, [3H]Tyr-Gly-Gly, was separated for liquid scintillation counting, using columns of Poropak Q as described previously(21Vogel Z. Altstein M. FEBS Lett. 1977; 80: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Inhibitors, at varying concentrations, were preincubated with the enzymes for 30 min before the addition of substrate, and as the concentration of substrate used for inhibition and pH studies was less than its Km for the enzyme, IC50 values were taken to be equal to Ki values(22Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). For pH studies, the buffers were used at 20 mM with the ionic strength kept at 0.05 with NaCl. Km and kcat values for leucine enkephalin degradation were determined using the substrate over a concentration range of 0.05-4 mM, with 25 nM [3H]leucine enkephalin included as a tracer. The values were calculated by linear regression analysis using the program Enzfit (Biosoft). The change in the free energies of binding were calculated from ΔG = RTln((kcat/Km)wt/(kcat/Km)mut) or ΔG = RTln(Kiwt/Kimut). In all cases, reactions were stopped when substrate degradation was ≤10%. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 12% polyacrylamide slab gels. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against commercially available thermolysin, and one, monoclonal antibody T1, was found, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, to also cross-react with NPr. Mapping experiments (not shown) showed that monoclonal antibody T1 recognizes an epitope contained within residues 206-255 of thermolysin, a region where there are only two amino acid differences in the sequences of thermolysin and NPr(2Vriend G. Eijsink V. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1993; 7: 367-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 1 ml of the culture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and 5 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For intracellular extracts, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 15% (w/v) sucrose and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After a 5-min incubation at 37°C, 180 μl of sample buffer was added, and 10 μl were taken for SDS-PAGE. Electroblotting, to nitrocellulose sheets, was carried out for 2 h at 200 V, and the blots were developed using a streptavidine-alkaline phosphatase system (Amersham Corp.). Wild-type and mutant NPrs were purified in a single step using the Gly-D-Phe affinity column with yields of around 5 mg/liter for the wild-type enzyme and 0.5 mg/liter for H231F-NPr and H231A-NPr. SDS-PAGE showed, for the three enzymes, the presence of a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa (Fig. 2). Recovery in each case was estimated to be around 50%, and the reduced yields of the mutant enzymes are therefore likely to be due to a decrease in the extracellular levels of the enzymes. The Bacillus neutral proteases are synthesized as preproenzymes, with the prosequence (200 residues for NPr) probably being removed at the cell membrane(23Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is thought to be an autocatalytic process, and mutations that change enzyme activity might therefore be expected to affect the levels of mature enzyme produced. This appeared to be the case for the mutations H231F and H231A, as Western blot analysis of the culture supernatants, using the monoclonal antibody Mab T1, showed that the wild-type enzyme was present in higher levels (Fig. 3). In contrast, in total cell extracts, a 60-kDa protein was detected, only in B. subtilis transformed with the mutated enzymes, which could correspond to the unprocessed proenzyme. Similar results were obtained when the active site histidine of the neutral protease from B. subtilis was mutated(24Toma S. Campagnoli S. De Gregoriis E. Gianna R. Margarit I. Zamai M. Grandi G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Western blots of extracellular and total cell extracts of B. subtilis. Extracellular extracts were as follows: lane 1, wild-type NPr; lane 2, H231F-NPr; lane 3, H231A-NPr. Total cell extracts were as follows: lane 4, wild-type NPr; lane 5, H231F-NPr; lane 6, H231A-NPr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At pH 7.0 in HEPES buffer, the Km values of the substrate, leucine enkephalin for H231F and H231A-NPr, were almost identical to its Km for the wild-type enzyme, indicating that mutating His-231 does not provoke any major changes in ground state binding. For the mutant enzymes, however, kcat values were lower, leading to decreases in kcat/Km of 430- and 500-fold for H231F and H231A, respectively (Table I) equivalent to a change in ΔG of 3.7-3.8 kcal/mol. These results are comparable with those obtained with the zinc exopeptidase, carboxypeptidase A (EC 3.4.17.1), whose active site has a similar topology to thermolysin(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 25Hausrath A.C. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18839-18842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of action has been proposed for both enzymes, with Arg-127, corresponding to His-231 of NPr, stabilizing the transition state, and site-directed mutagenesis of this residue led to large reductions in kcat with relatively small changes in Km(26Phillips M.A. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20692-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this instance, it was calculated that the arginine could stabilize the transition state by 4.1-6.0 kcal/mol. Another zinc endopeptidase, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (EC 3.4.24.11) is also thought to have an active site organization that closely resembles that of the Bacillus enzymes, although no crystal structure is available (for review, see Ref. 7). In this enzyme, His-711 has been proposed to stabilize the transition state(27Bateman Jr., R.C. Kim Y.-A. Slaughter C. Hersh L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8365-8368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutating this residue to Phe led to a 40-fold reduction in kcat/Km, lower than found here, but the changes were again primarily due to a decrease in kcat(28Dion N. LeMoual H. Crine P. Boileau G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that His-711 of the mammalian enzyme and His-231 of the Bacillus enzymes may have similar roles in their respective enzymes.Table I:Kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of leucine enkephalin by wild-type, H231F, and H231A NPrs Open table in a new tab The optimum pH for the degradation of 50 nM [3H]leucine enkephalin by the wild-type enzyme was in the range of pH 6.0-6.8 (Fig. 4), and, as previously reported for thermolysin(29Feder J. Brougham L.R. Wildi B.S. Biochemistry. 1974; 9: 2784-2791Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar), enzymatic activity varied with the buffer used, being higher in HEPES than in Tris. For the mutant enzyme H231F-NPr, optimum activity was between pH 7.5 and 8.5, and at pH 8.5 in Tris buffer the mutant enzyme was only 30-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. The activity of the Bacillus neutral proteases has been shown to depend on two groups, one with an acidic pKa, suggested to be either Glu-143 (6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar) or the zinc-bound water molecule(9Mock W.L. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a second species with a pKa around 7.5-8.0, suggested to be His-231 (6, 9). As expected, therefore, little pH dependence was observed in the alkaline pH range with H231F-NPr, and the pKa of the remaining ionizable group was also apparently influenced by the mutation. The inhibition of [3H]leucine enkephalin hydrolysis by wild-type and mutated enzymes was compared using representative molecules of the different classes of inhibitors for neutral proteases (Table II). The presumed binding modes of these molecules to the active site of NPr are shown in Fig. 5, taken from data obtained by the cocrystallization of these molecules or their analogues with thermolysin(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 30Roderick S.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1493-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All of the molecules tested have a hydrophobic residue to fit into the S′1 subsite and a strong zinc-chelating group. It is important to note that the Ki values of the inhibitors for the wild-type NPr were not significantly different to those obtained with thermolysin (31),3 3A. Beaumont, M. O'Donohue, N. Paredes, N. Rousselet, M. Assicot, C. Bohuon, M.-C. Fournié-Zaluski, and B. P. Roques, unpublished observations. confirming the similarities in the active sites of the two proteases. The values reported in were obtained using 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0 containing 5 mM CaCl2.Table II:Ki values of inhibitors, for wild-type and mutated NPrs Open table in a new tab Mutating His-231 to either Phe or Ala did not modify significantly the Ki values of the sulfydryl-containing inhibitors thiorphan, retrothiorphan, and JCH 24. This is in agreement with molecular modelling studies (20Benchetrit T. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the cocrystallization of thiorphan and retrothiorphan with thermolysin (30), showing that these molecules bind as substrate analogues, with no apparent interaction with His-231, as previously reported with another thiorphan-like inhibitor, (2-benzyl-3-mercaptopropanoyl)-L-alanylglycinamide (32). It was found that, as predicted(20Benchetrit T. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), both thiorphan and retrothiorphan have similar interactions in the active site despite the retroinversion of the amide bond in the latter. The most important of these are the coordination of the SH group with the zinc atom, the binding of the P′1 residue in the S′1 subsite, and hydrogen bonding between the carbonyl and carbonyl amide group of the peptide bond with Arg-203 and Asn-113, respectively. The fact that mutating His-231 made little difference to the Ki values of these inhibitors indicates that these interactions can still be fulfilled and again shows that the overall geometry of the active site in its ground state has probably not been greatly altered. Again these results can be compared with those found for carboxypeptidase A, where mutating Arg-127 had only a small effect on the binding of ground state inhibitors(26Phillips M.A. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20692-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutating His-231 decreased significantly the affinities of the hydroxamate inhibitors HACBOGly and ST 51, and the carboxylate inhibitor ES 92. For HACBOGly, Ki values were increased 80-fold, and for ST 51 the increases were 100-fold for H231F-NPr and 180-fold for H231A-NPr, equivalent to a change in ΔG of between 2.7 and 3.2 kcal/mol. Similar hydroxamate inhibitors have been described as mimicking reaction intermediates, binding to the active site of thermolysin in a bidentate fashion, with the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl oxygen of the hydroxamate group ligated to the zinc(33Holmes M.A. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6912-6920Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), resembling the presumed pentacoordinate complex of the transition state in catalysis(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The formation of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the bidentate group and His-231 was also predicted. With the carboxylate inhibitor ES 92, mutating His-231 provoked a 250-fold increase in Ki or a change in ΔG of 3.4 kcal/mol. Again, this is in line with x-ray crystallographic studies of thermolysin, showing that the bidentate mode of binding of a carboxylate group resembles the presumed geometry of the tetrahedral transition state with a hydrogen bond being formed between one oxygen of the carboxyl group and His-231(25Hausrath A.C. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18839-18842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Monzingo A.F. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5724-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The largest differences in Ki values were found with the phosphoramidate inhibitor, phosphoramidon, which had a Ki of 63 nM for the wild-type enzyme, with no inhibition of either H231F or H231A-NPr being observed at an inhibitor concentration of 1 mM, giving a difference in binding energy of >6 kcal/mol. Such a large increase in Ki was perhaps unexpected, although phosphoramidon has been described as a transition state inhibitor with one of its phosphoryl oxygens ligated to the zinc in a tetrahedral complex and also forming hydrogen bonds with His-231 and Tyr-157(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 35Tronrud D.E. Monzingo A.F. Matthews B.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding of phosphoramidon in the alkaline range has been shown to be critically dependent on one ionizable group (36), which is likely to be His-231. Moreover, mutating Arg-127 of carboxypeptidase A also led to large decreases in the binding affinity of a transition state analogue of 5.8 kcal/mol(26Phillips M.A. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20692-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies have indicated that His-231 of the Bacillus neutral proteases stabilizes the transition state by forming a hydrogen bond with the oxygen of the amide bond to be cleaved (Fig. 1A)(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a more crucial function for the residue has recently been proposed from mechanistic studies, in which it would polarize the attacking water molecule in the first step of catalysis (Fig. 1B)(9Mock W.L. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a role previously subscribed to Glu-143(6Matthews B.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1988; 21: 333-340Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The results presented here would seem to be in favor of the less critical role for His-231 in catalysis, as its replacement by either Phe or Ala led to the production of enzymes that still retained proteolytic activity, albeit reduced. In addition, this reduction, mostly due to a decreased kcat, was of the same order as that obtained when the residue proposed to stabilize the transition state of carboxypeptidase A (Arg-127) was mutated(26Phillips M.A. Fletterick R. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20692-20698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to mutations of Glu-143 from the neutral proteases of B. stearothermophillus MK232 (37Kubo M. Mitsuda Y. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3779-3783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and B. subtilis(24Toma S. Campagnoli S. De Gregoriis E. Gianna R. Margarit I. Zamai M. Grandi G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which led to enzymes with undetectable proteolytic activity. Similar results were obtained when the corresponding consensus sequence glutamate of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 was mutated(38Devault A. Nault C. Zollinger M. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that loss of activity provoked by these mutations might be due to major perturbations of the active site, resulting from the replacement of the negatively charged Glu(9Mock W.L. Aksamawati M. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, inactive mutants were obtained even when the Glu was changed to Asp(37Kubo M. Mitsuda Y. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 3779-3783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Devault A. Nault C. Zollinger M. Fournié-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, in addition, inhibitor binding to the Asp mutant of neutral endopeptidase-24.11 was unchanged(38Devault A. Nault C.

INTRODUCTIONLignin peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), an extracellular heme peroxidase produced by white rot, has been shown to catalyze the depolymerization of lignin (1Hammel K.E. Moen M.A. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1991; 13: 15-18Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar) as well as the oxidation of a range of compounds of relatively high redox potential (2Kersten P.J. Kalyanaraman B. Hammel K.E. Reinhamar B. Kirk T.K. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (for recent reviews see Refs. 3-5). Aromatic compounds, in particular the fungal secondary metabolite veratryl alcohol (VA)1 1The abbreviations used are: VAveratryl alcoholMMA4-methoxymandelic acidGygray (SI unit of radiation dose (1 Gy = 1 J kg-1))HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. (3,4-dimethoxybenzyl alcohol), have been shown to enhance the enzyme action, but their function has not yet been satisfactorily elucidated. It has been suggested (6Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) that veratryl alcohol is oxidized by the peroxidase to a radical cation and that this species plays a key role in the catalytic cycle by acting as a redox mediator between the enzyme and its substrates(3Schoemaker H.E. Lundell T.K. Hatakka A.I. Piontek K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 321-332Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar), or by converting compound III, an inactive enzyme intermediate formed by reaction of compound II with hydrogen peroxide, to the native (ferric) state(7Valli K. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Barr D.P. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has also ben proposed that VA (unoxidized) protects against formation of compound III by supplying a reducing equivalent that prevents accumulation of compound II(9Pasczynski A. Crawford R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10Koduri R.S. Tien M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Further progress in this field has been hampered by the lack of information on the lifetime and reactivity of the veratryl alcohol radical cation. NMR experiments (11Gilardi G. Harvey P.J. Cass A.E.G. Palmer J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1041: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) suggest its formation during the oxidation of VA by lignin peroxidase, but its detection by EPR has not been possible(12Tien M. Kirk T.K. Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radical cations of aromatic compounds can be conveniently studied by radiation chemistry methods, especially pulse radiolysis(13O'Neill P. Steenken S. Schulte-Frohlinde D. J. Phys. Chem. 1975; 79: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this technique(14Tabata Y. Pulse Radiolysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar), a short pulse of accelerated electrons, typically of a few nanoseconds, is used to generate a quantifiable amount of free radicals in solution, usually in the micromolar range, in less than a microsecond. The reactivity of these radicals is usually monitored spectrophotometrically, by conductometry or other detection techniques.In the present study, using radiation chemistry techniques we were able to measure the veratryl alcohol radical cation absorption spectrum as well as its lifetime and reactivity toward two model compounds, a polymeric dye (Poly R-478) and 4-methoxymandelic acid.MATERIALS AND METHODSCommercial chemicals from Sigma or Aldrich of the highest purity available were used in this study. Solutions prepared with water purified with a Millipore Milli-Q system were degassed for about 30 min before irradiation with oxygen free nitrous oxide (N2O) or with a mixture of N2O and oxygen (5%, v/v) (from British Oxygen Company).Pulse radiolysis with spectrophotometric detection was performed with a 4-MeV van de Graaff accelerator as described previously(15Candeias L.P. Everett S.A. Wardman P. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1993; 15: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The doses per pulse were calibrated with N2O-saturated solutions of KSCN solutions (10 mmol dm-3), assuming the product of the radiation chemical yield and extinction coefficient of (SCN) equal to 5.1 × 10-3 Gy-1 cm-1 (16). Conductance detection used conventional conductance cells with platinum electrodes (cell constant = 0.2 cm-1) to which a polarizing voltage 10 V/10 MHz AC was applied. Steady-state irradiation used a 60Co γ-source with an activity of about 35 TBq. Irradiations were performed at a dose rate of 7.9 Gy min-1, as determined by a Fricke dosimeter(17Tabata Y. Ito Y. Tagawa S. Handbook of Radiation Chemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 79-80Google Scholar).Analysis of solutions used a HPLC equipped with a Hichrom Hypersil 50DS column and a Waters 490 multiwavelength detector, operating at 280 nm. Elution was achieved with a flow of 2 ml min-1 of a mixture of 15 mmol dm-3 potassium acetate at pH 3.8 and a gradient (10-50% in 5 min) of 75% acetonitrile.RESULTSThe unstable ion Tl2+ is a strong oxidant that reacts with many methoxylated aromatic compounds to yield the respective radical cations(13O'Neill P. Steenken S. Schulte-Frohlinde D. J. Phys. Chem. 1975; 79: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It can be conveniently generated by radiolysis of aqueous solutions of Tl+ saturated with nitrous oxide. Under these conditions, the hydroxyl radical is the main reactive species resulting from irradiation, and it reacts with Tl+ according to Reaction 1 (18Cercek B. Ebert M. Swallow A.J. J. Chem. Soc. A. 1966; : 612-615Crossref Google Scholar). O·H+Tl+→OH−+Tl2+Reaction 1 In the present study solutions of Tl+ (1 mol dm-3) in 1 mmol dm-3 HClO4 were used. This concentration of Tl+ is adjusted to give the maximum yield of Tl2-, whereas the HClO4 sets the pH close to that used in previous studies with lignin peroxidase. Under these conditions, the radiation-chemical yield of Tl2- was 0.46 μmol J-1, determined by monitoring the oxidation of ABTS2- (2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate)) to the stable radical ABTS (λmax= 417 nm, c = 34,700 dm3 mol-1 cm-1(19Scott S.L.

Chem. 1993; 97: 6710-6714Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar).We have applied the reaction of radiolytically generated Tl2- with VA to produce the respective radical cation and study its spectroscopic properties and reactivity. The transient absorption spectrum recorded by pulse radiolysis on reaction of Tl2- with VA is shown in Fig. 1. The two absorption bands at 300 and 420 nm are characteristic of the absorption spectra of the radical cations of methoxylated aromatics(13O'Neill P. Steenken S. Schulte-Frohlinde D. J. Phys. Chem. 1975; 79: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), suggesting that the veratryl alcohol radical cation was formed. The increase of absorption at 430 nm was exponential and had a rate constant proportional to the VA concentration (in the range 10-50 μmol dm-3), from which the second order rate constant of Fig. R2 was determined (k = (5.4 ± 0.1) × 108 dm3 mol-1 s-1).Figure R2:Reaction 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar experiments were performed with conductometric detection. Following the radiation pulse, a decrease of conductance was observed, attributable to the formation of OH¯ in and consequent neutralization of one equivalent of H+. However, the decreased conductance persisted longer than the completion of Fig. R2, which shows that the latter reaction does not generate or deplete further H+, in support of the formation of VA.In longer time scales, the absorption at 430 nm was observed to decay slowly, and the conductance returned to the prepulse value. We conclude therefore that VA decays with release of a proton, i.e. into an uncharged species that does not absorb at 430 nm. Through experiments with optical detection, we found that the rate of decay was independent both of the VA concentration (20-80 μmol dm-3) and of the initial concentration of radicals in the range ~0.5 to ~5 μmol dm-3 (i.e. of the radiation dose in the range ~1 to ~10 Gy). In view of these observations, we conclude that the radical cation decays by a first order process, probably by deprotonation form the α-carbon. The rate of this decay was determined as k = 17 ± 2 s-1, i.e. the lifetime of the veratryl alcohol radical cation, defined as the reciprocal of the rate constant, is 59 ± 8 ms.Chromatographic analysis of identical solutions irradiated under steady-state conditions showed that veratryl aldehyde is the main stable product formed on oxidation of veratryl alcohol by Tl2-. From the dependence of the concentration of veratryl aldehyde on the radiation dose (see Fig. 3), it can be estimated that this product accounts for about 93% of the Tl2- generated by irradiation. The oxidation of the carbon-centerd radical formed in Fig. R3 leads to veratryl aldehyde, and the high yield observed suggests that the solutions used in the experiments described contain a substance that is able to carry out this oxidation, probably Tl+.Figure 3:Formation of veratryl aldehyde and the bleaching of Poly R.

In a pulse radiolysis experiment, VA was generated by reaction with Tl2- in the presence of Poly R (up to 25 mg dm-3). Under these conditions the decay of VA, monitored by the absorption at 430 nm (Fig. 2a), was fast and exhibited a rate proportional to the concentration of the dye. Simultaneously, a bleaching of the dye could be observed at 548 nm (Fig. 2b) which had the same rate as the decay at 430 nm, a good indication that a reaction between the veratryl alcohol radical cation and the polymer was taking place. The second order rate constant of this reaction, determined from the linear dependence of the rate of decay at 430 or 548 nm on the Poly R concentration, is (5.1 ± 0.7) × 108 dm3 (mol of monomer)-1 s-1.Figure 2:Reaction of the veratryl radical cation with Poly R. Transient absorption at 430 nm showing the decay of the veratryl alcohol radical cation (a) and at 548 nm showing the simultaneous bleaching of Poly R (b). Traces were recorded on pulse radiolysis of a N2O-saturated solution of veratryl alcohol (100 μmol dm-3), Poly R (5 g dm-3), and Tl+ and HClO4 as inFig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, the same reaction was investigated by steady-state radiolysis experiments with similar solutions containing Poly R (25 mg dm-3). The bleaching of the dye was measured by the decrease of absorption at 548 nm, and the formation of veratryl aldehyde was monitored by HPLC. Pulse radiolysis experiments showed that under these conditions VA is formed initially in 85% yield relative to the Tl2-. However, in the steady-state experiments bleaching of the dye was observed, and no consumption of veratryl alcohol could be measured. Moreover, the yield of veratryl aldehyde was decreased to ~ 7% of that measured in the absence of Poly R (Fig. 3).It can therefore be concluded that VA reacts with Poly R to regenerate veratryl alcohol and bleach the polymer, presumably involving a radical cation of the latter as intermediate. VA·++Poly R→VA+Poly R·+Reaction 4 In a previous study, 4-methoxymandelic acid (MMA; hydroxy(4-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid) was used as a model recalcitrant substrate that could only be oxidized by lignin peroxidase if veratryl alcohol was present(6Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The one-electron oxidation of MMA yields a zwitterion that undergoes rapid elimination of carbon dioxide, and in the presence of oxygen the resulting radical is completely converted into anisaldehyde.2 2L. P. Candeias and P. J. Harvey, manuscript in preparation. In agreement with this mechanism, the oxidation of MMA by Tl2- in a solution saturated with a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen (20% v/v) yielded anisaldehyde in quantitative yield. A similar experiment was performed with a solution that contained, in addition, veratryl alcohol (1 mol dm-3). Under these conditions, most of the Tl2- formed (about 78%) reacts with veratryl alcohol, and accordingly the yield of anisaldehyde was greatly reduced (Fig. 4). In fact, the anisaldehyde formed under these conditions can be essentially accounted for by the fraction of Tl2- reacting with 4-methoxymandelic acid, suggesting that the veratryl alcohol radical cation did not oxidize MMA significantly. On the basis of our results, we estimate the rate constant of this reaction to be ≤5 × 104 dm3 mol-1 s-1.Figure 4:Inhibition of the oxidation of 4-methoxymandelic acid by veratryl alcohol. MMA (squares) is quantitatively oxidized to anisaldehyde (circles) in a solution saturated with N2O + O2 (5%, v/v) (open symbols), but in the presence of 1 mmol dm-3 veratryl alcohol (1 mmol dm-3) the reaction is inhibited (solid symbols). The solutions contained Tl+ and HClO4 (as inFig. 1) and were irradiated and analyzed by HPLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONUsing the pulse radiolysis technique, we have been able for the first time to observe directly the formation and decay of the veratryl alcohol radical cation, to record its absorption spectrum (Fig. 1), and to measure its lifetime (59 ± 8 ms). Previous attempts to detect this species by EPR were unsuccessful(12Tien M. Kirk T.K. Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1687-1693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the lifetime reported here confirms that VA may be too short lived to be detected by that technique.One of the reasons for suggesting an involvement of the veratryl alcohol radical cation in the lignin peroxidase-catalyzed degradation of lignin was the impossibility of a spatial interaction between the heme and the polymer. It was therefore proposed that veratryl alcohol “redox cycles,” i.e. the radical cation serves as an electron carrier between the polymer and the enzyme. However, the short lifetime attributed to VA until now seemed incompatible with this hypothesis. In conjunction with the Einstein-Smoluschowski equation of diffusion, the lifetime of 59 ms implies that VA can migrate about 7 μm in an aqueous environment. Obviously, this distance is sufficient to allow the oxidation of a polymer at a considerable distance from the peroxidase.The ability of veratryl alcohol to redox cycle is well illustrated by the results with Poly R. In the chemical system used, the veratryl alcohol radical cation acted as an electron carrier between the oxidant (Tl2-) and the polymeric dye. Presumably, the veratryl alcohol radical cations generated by lignin peroxidase will behave similarly, at least toward Poly R. However, due to the difficulty of measuring degradation of an insoluble polymer, the reaction of VA with lignin has not been directly observed.Different results were obtained with 4-methoxymandelic acid; no electron transfer between this compound and the veratryl alcohol radical cation could be observed. This is in agreement with the prediction that 4-methoxymandelic acid, with a single methoxy substituent, has a higher redox potential than veratryl alcohol. However, in the event of reversible electron transfer, equilibrium 6 would be shifted to the right by the short lifetime of the MMA radical cation. VA·++MMA⇄VA+MMA·+Reaction 6 Therefore, the failure to observe the oxidation of MMA by veratryl alcohol radical cation may reflect not only a thermodynamic but also a kinetic barrier to. In other words, the finite lifetime of VA may be too short for the establishment of equilibrium 6.With respect to the oxidation of 4-methoxymandelic acid, the results of radiation chemical oxidation contrast with the previous observations in the enzyme system(6Harvey P.J. Schoemaker H.E. Palmer J.M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 242-246Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). When equimolar mixtures of 4-methoxymandelic acid and veratryl alcohol were incubated with lignin peroxidase (in the presence of hydrogen peroxide), MMA and not VA was oxidized, although MMA alone was not a substrate for the enzyme. It appears that veratryl alcohol can oxidize 4-methoxymandelic acid in the enzyme system but not when generated in aqueous solution by a chemical oxidant. In order to solve this apparent discrepancy, we suggest that the veratryl alcohol radical cation may exist as an enzyme-bound species and that the binding may overcome either the thermodynamic or the kinetic barrier to the oxidation of methoxymandelic acid. Binding of several peroxidases to their substrates has been demonstrated, although the results obtained with veratryl alcohol and lignin peroxidase are ambiguous (20). We hypothesize that veratryl alcohol binds to the enzyme and that after electron transfer to the heme, the veratryl alcohol radical cation may react with a second substrate prior to its release.It is conceivable that the suggested binding would prolong the lifetime of the veratryl alcohol radical cation to the extent of allowing to proceed. Cases are known in which radicals that are unstable in aqueous solution become stabilized in an enzyme environment; for example, the active ribonucleotide reductase contains a long-lived tyrosine radical(21Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the reduction potential of the bound veratryl alcohol radical cation may be higher than when it exists free in solution and therefore make the free energy variation associated with less positive. This hypothesis is substantiated by recent calculations showing the existence of a positively charged region around the active site of lignin peroxidase (22), which would be expected to increase the reduction potential of a radical cation immersed in it.An alternative role for the veratryl alcohol radical cation in the catalytic cycle of lignin peroxidase is the conversion of an inactive form (compound III) back into active enzyme(8Barr D.P. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). With the 1,2,4,5-tetramethoxybenzene radical cation this reaction was directly observed(8Barr D.P. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but in the case of veratryl alcohol only indirect evidence can be obtained. Clearly, the possibility of a bound veratryl alcohol radical cation is not contrary to the reactivation of compound III. The lifetime of VA implies that its steady-state concentration during the enzyme cycle will be of the order of micromolar (steady-state concentration = rate of turnover/17 s-1). Therefore, the reaction with compound III at a rate sufficient to prevent inactivation would require a very high bimolecular rate constant. However, a veratryl alcohol radical cation bound to the enzyme active site is readily available to react with compound III.In summary, the lifetime of the veratryl alcohol radical cation (59 ± 8 ms) is sufficient to enable it to migrate over large distances (about 7 μm in aqueous solution) and possibly act as a redox mediator. The oxidation of Poly R-478 shows that, at least with this polymer, VA can act as a redox mediator. However, 4-methoxymandelic acid is not oxidized by VA in aqueous solution, in disagreement with the conclusions from studies with lignin peroxidase. We therefore suggest that VA can exist as an enzyme-bound species and that in this state it has either a longer lifetime or a higher reduction potential than in bulk solution.

It has also ben proposed that VA (unoxidized) protects against formation of compound III by supplying a reducing equivalent that prevents accumulation of compound II(9Pasczynski A. Crawford R.L.

The radical cations of aromatic compounds can be conveniently studied by radiation chemistry methods, especially pulse radiolysis(13O'Neill P. Steenken S. Schulte-Frohlinde D. J. Phys. Chem. 1975; 79: 2773-2779Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this technique(14Tabata Y. Pulse Radiolysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990Google Scholar), a short pulse of accelerated electrons, typically of a few nanoseconds, is used to generate a quantifiable amount of free radicals in solution, usually in the micromolar range, in less than a microsecond. The reactivity of these radicals is usually monitored spectrophotometrically, by conductometry or other detection techniques.In the present study, using radiation chemistry techniques we were able to measure the veratryl alcohol radical cation absorption spectrum as well as its lifetime and reactivity toward two model compounds, a polymeric dye (Poly R-478) and 4-methoxymandelic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2131402302,"Aldose reductase (ALR2) shows a strong specificity for its nucleotide coenzyme, binding NADPH much more tightly than NADH (KD of <1μMversus 1.2 mM respectively). Interactions responsible for this specificity include salt linkages between the highly conserved residues Lys-262 and Arg-268, and the 2′-phosphate of NADP(H). Previous studies show that mutation of Lys-262 results in an increase in the Km for both coenzyme and aldehyde substrate, as well as in the kcat of reduction. The present study shows that mutation of Arg-268 to methionine results in a 36-fold increase in Km and 205-fold increase in KD for NADPH, but little change in Km for DL-glyceraldehyde or in the kcat of the reaction. Calculation of free energy changes show that the 2′-phosphate of NADPH contributes 4.7 kcal/mol of binding energy to its interaction with WT-hALR2. For the R268M mutant, the interaction of NADPH was destabilized by 3.2 kcal/mol, indicating that the mutation decreases the binding energy of NADPH by 65%. The effect of removing Arg-268 in the absence of the 2′-phosphate of NADPH was virtually identical to the destabilization of the activation energy in the absence of the 2′-phosphate itself (1.9 versus 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively). Therefore, while the 2′-phosphate of the coenzyme plays a role in both coenzyme binding and transition state stabilization during catalysis, the role of Arg-268 lies strictly in tighter coenzyme binding.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the reaction the enzyme●NADP+ complex undergoes a slow rate-limiting conformational change which allows NADP+ to dissociate from the enzyme(9Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Putney C.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6510-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of human ALR2 with NADPH has revealed that the coenzyme becomes locked into place by movement of a loop (loop 7) that folds over the coenzyme(14Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24841-24847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conformational change contributes to the very tight binding of the coenzyme (9Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Putney C.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9947-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) which, given the high [NADPH]/[NADP+] physiological ratio (16Veech R.L. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. Vol. II. Wiley Interscience, New York1987: 79-104Google Scholar) ensures that ALR2 is saturated with NADPH at all times. This allows the enzyme to be set to act rapidly on aldehydes as they appear(5Grimshaw C.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interaction of coenzyme with ALR2 is critical for the binding of aldose reductase inhibitors(17Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). Our current studies focus specifically on the binding interactions of the 2′-phosphate of NADPH to ALR2. ALR2 has a strong specificity for its nucleotide substrate, binding NADPH much more tightly than NADH (4). Binding interactions between ALR2 and NADPH that are responsible for this specificity must reside with the 2′-phosphate which is absent in NADH. The crystal structures of recombinant hALR2(14Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), as well as the hALR2-C298S mutant(15Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24841-24847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both complexed with NADPH, show that the adenosine mononucleotide is firmly secured by the interactions with its 2′-phosphate group. The phosphate forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of Ser-263, Thr-265, and the main chain NH of Val-264 (14). It is also involved in salt links and hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Lys-262 and Arg-268 residues that are also conserved among other members of the aldo-keto reductase family(14Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 15Borhani D.W. Harter T.M. Petrash J.M. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Lys-262 to methionine in human ALR2 results in a large increase in Km for both the coenzyme NADPH and the substrate DL-glyceraldehyde as well as an increase in the kcat of the reaction(24Bohren K.M.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the contribution of Arg-268 to NADPH binding and the transition state by comparing the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of coenzyme binding (NADP(H) and NAD(H)) to the wild type ALR2 and the R268M mutant. The WT, recombinant human muscle ALR2 was over expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21(DE3) cells containing pLysS plasmid) using the plasmid, pET20b (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the NcoI/EcoRI site. This vector contains a pelB leader sequence upstream of the NcoI cloning site which is designed for export of target proteins into the periplasmic space. The leader sequence is removed in vivo by signal peptidase as the protein is exported(26Yanagida N. Uozumi T. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 937-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Better M. Chang C.P. Robinson R.R. Horwitz A.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1041-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Human fetal muscle ALR2 cDNA in pGEM-4Z subcloned into the EcoRI site was generously supplied by Chihiro Nishimura(28Nishimura C. Matsuura Y. Kokai Y. Akera T. Carper D. Morjana N. Lyons C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9788-9792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA was partially digested by NcoI and EcoRI, and fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA band corresponding to 1339 base pairs was cut from the gel and treated with Gel'ase (New England BioLabs) following the manufacturers protocol. This fragment was then ligated into pET20b at the NcoI/EcoRI site. Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-268 was performed using the Mutagene M13 In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit (Bio-Rad) by following the manufacturers protocol. The oligonucleotide used to generate the R268M mutation was 5′-CAGCAATCATTTCTGGTG-3′, and was hybridized to a single stranded M13 mp19/hALR2 cDNA insert containing a R268K mutation. The oligonucleotide used to generate the R268K mutant was 5′-GTTCTCAGCAATCTTTTCTGGTGTCAC-3′. Both the WT and R268M-hALR2 cDNA were completely sequenced after subcloning into the expression vector to verify the desired mutation and to ensure that no other mutations had occurred. Ten-liter bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an absorbance of 0.6 at 660 nm. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM and the cultures were then incubated overnight at 30°C. The cells were then harvested by centrifuging at 4420 × g for 15 min. The periplasmic fraction was then prepared as described previously(26Yanagida N. Uozumi T. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 937-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Grundmann U. Bohn H. Obermeier R.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4°C, as described for native, muscle hALR2(31Morjana N.A. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2906-2911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was dialyzed against 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and stored at 4°C. Both purified WT and R268M apoenzyme concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using ∊ = 53,000 M-1 cm-1(32Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration of crude protein preparations for the purification table (Table I) were determined by the Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard.Table I:Purification of WT-hALR2 from 10 liters of culture Open table in a new tab Antibodies against hALR2 were prepared by Affinity Biologicals of Hamilton, ON, using native, muscle hALR2. To remove anti-E. coli IgG, the antibody preparation was preadsorbed with an extract of BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pLysS plasmid(34Mierendorf R.C. Percy C. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The extract was prepared by growing the culture to saturation, harvesting the cells by centrifugation, resuspending the cells in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 25% sucrose, pH 7.5. After a second centrifugation, the cells were then osmotically shocked by suspending in ice-cold water, and kept on ice for 30 min. An equal volume of serum (10 ml) containing the antibody preparation was then incubated with this extract for 1 h at room temperature with constant stirring, and centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 15 min. This preparation was stored at 4°C in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. Fractionation of proteins was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar) by the conditions suggested previously(36Promega Promega Protein Guide: Tips and Techniques. Promega Corporation, Madison, WI1993Google Scholar). Western blots were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) overnight at a constant current of 20 mA onto Immobilon Transfer Membrane (Millipore). The detection system used was goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate from Sigma at a dilution of 1/2000. The general procedures have been described(10Kubiseski T.J. Hyndman D.J. Morjana N.A. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6510-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard enzyme activity assay during purification of the WT-hALR2 enzyme was carried out in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4 mMDL-glyceraldehyde and 100 μM NADPH in a total of 1 ml. The enzyme activity assay was identical for the R268M mutant, except no ammonium sulfate was present in the reaction mixture. For kinetic studies, enzyme activity was determined in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing the appropriate concentrations of substrates. The reactions were started by addition of aldehyde, as suggested previously(9Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Putney C.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9947-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The initial velocity was computed using a quadratic fit to the progress curve from 0 to 120 s, to ensure measurement of the initial steady-state rate(9Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Putney C.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9947-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants for DL-glyceraldehyde reduction by WT in the presence of NADH were determined from assays at 366 nm using a 5-mm path-length cuvette, as were the constants determined for R268M-hALR2 in the presence of NADPH. For the reaction catalyzed by R268M in the presence of NADH, the rates were determined at 386 nm. All standard errors of fits were less than 30%. The steady-state kinetic constants and their standard errors were calculated by fitting the equations in the hyperbolic form to the data with a least-squares analysis using the Marquardt algorithm with the program Kinetics Software (Hewlett-Packard HP89512). For the WT, the kinetic constants were determined by fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation directly. The data from the initial velocity studies of the R268M showed best fit to the equation for a sequential mechanism, υ=VmaxAB/(KAB+KBA+AB+K1AKB(Eq. 1) where v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity at saturating substrate concentrations, A and B are the two substrate concentrations, KA and KB are their corresponding Michaelis constants, and KIA is the dissociation constant of substrate A. The KI values in Table II determined from product inhibition studies were obtained from a fit to Equation 2 for competitive inhibition, υ=VmaxA/[(KA(1+I/KI+A](Eq. 2) Table II:Kinetic and inhibition constants for nicotinamide nucleotides with WT and R268M-hALR2 Open table in a new tab where KI is the competitive inhibition constant, I is the inhibitor (NADP+ or NAD+) concentration, and A is the concentration of the varied substrate (NADPH). The interaction of NADPH and NADP+ to WT-hALR2 was examined by intrinsic enzyme fluorescence under identical conditions to thoses described previously(10Kubiseski T.J. Hyndman D.J. Morjana N.A. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6510-6517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractional saturation (α) by coenzyme of the total coenzyme binding sites was equated to the ratio ΔF/ΔFmax, where ΔF is the amount of fluorescence reduction at a specified coenzyme concentration and ΔFmax is the amount of fluorescence reduction at fully saturating coenzyme concentration. Dissociation constants were determined from modified Scatchard plots (38) as described previously for the tight binding of the coenzymes to WT-hALR2(21Ehrig T. Bohren K.M. Prendergast F.G. Gabbay K.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Jahangiri G. Putney C.G. McKercher S.R. Mathur E.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5343-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This method relates the fractional saturation α to the total concentration of ligand, Lo, by the equation, Lo/α=KD/(1-+α)+Eo(Eq. 3) where Eo is the total active site concentration, and KD is the dissociation constant. A plot of 1/(1-α) versus Lo/α yields a theoretically straight line for a homogenous ligand receptor, with the slope equal to the binding constant and y axis intercept equal to the concentration of binding sites. As Stinson and Holbrook noted(38Stinson R.A. Holbrook J.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it is imperative that the true ΔFmax be determined. An error in ΔFmax as little as 5% leads to nonlinearity (previously attributed to heterogeneity(21Ehrig T. Bohren K.M. Prendergast F.G. Gabbay K.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7157-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) for the plot described by Equation 3. Therefore, the titration curve was initially fitted to the equation, ΔF=Lo·ΔFmax/(K+Lo)(Eq. 4) to determine the ΔFmax at infinite coenzyme concentration, and subsequently used in Equation 3, for the determination of the true KD. summarizes the results of a typical purification of WT-hALR2 extracted from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the pLysS plasmid as well as the pET20b/hALR2 expression vector. Routinely, 10 liters of culture gave 2.6 mg of purified protein for both the WT and R268M mutant. The yield of hALR2 was much lower than had been recorded previously from other expression systems, including another pET system(24Bohren K.M. Page J.L. Shankar R. Henry S.P. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24031-24037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nishimura C. Matsuura Y. Kokai Y. Akera T. Carper D. Morjana N. Lyons C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been speculated that, for pET21d, some elements may be present that reduce the vectors transcription efficiency(40Davis G.J. Carr L.G. Hurley T.D. Li T.-K. Bosron W.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and it is possible that these elements may be present in pET20b as well. The expression vector was engineered to contain a pelB leader sequence upstream of the initial methionine when cloned into the NcoI site, which allows for the export of target proteins into the periplasmic space. This was done to ease purification and decrease the amount of recombinant protein that could form inclusion bodies. The leader sequence is removed in vivo by a signal peptidase as the protein is exported(26Yanagida N. Uozumi T. Beppu T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 937-944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Better M. Chang C.P. Robinson R.R. Horwitz A.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1041-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Purified WT and the R268M mutant were directly sequenced from the N terminus for 10 cycles, and this confirmed that the signal peptide was completely removed except for an alanine residue, which preceded the initial methionine of the hALR2 sequence predicted by its cDNA(2Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nishimura C. Matsuura Y. Kokai Y. Akera T. Carper D. Morjana N. Lyons C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9788-9792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of kinetic constants for the WT-hALR2 with constants previously published for recombinant hALR2 (11Tarle I. Borhani D.W. Wilson D.K. Quiocho F.A. Petrash J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25687-25693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bohren K.M. Page J.L. Shankar R. Henry S.P. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol.

Commun. 1992; 183: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that the extra alanine residue did not alter the kinetic properties of the WT-hALR2. The final enzyme preparations were homogenous as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). Western blot analysis using purified anti-hALR2 antiserum showed a cross-reacting band in an extract of BL21(DE3) culture that contained the hALR2/pET20b expression vector and that was induced with IPTG (Fig. 1B, lane 4). No cross-reactivity was detected in either the uninduced culture (Fig. 1B, lane 3) or BL21(DE3) cells lacking the expression vector, but induced by IPTG (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Purified recombinant WT-hALR2 and mutant R268M-hALR2 both cross-reacted with the antiserum. During purification, endogenously bound nucleotides were removed by the 30-90% ammonium sulfate step and subsequent gel filtration. This step increased the amount of enzyme that bound to the blue dextran affinity column, since Cibracon blue interacts at the coenzyme binding site of proteins(41Thompson S.T. Cass K.H. Stellwagen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 669-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Elution of this column with 1 M salt resulted in protein free of nucleotides as indicated by spectrophotometric analysis of eluate which showed an absorbance peak at 280 nm. This allowed for the spectrophotometric quantization of the enzyme(32Branlant G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The introduction of the R268M mutant of hALR2 did not appear to cause any gross structural perturbations. At 22 and 37°C, both enzymes were stable over 4 h in either the absence or presence of NADPH/NADH (data not shown). The structural perturbation introduced in the R268M mutant of hALR2 is essentially only the removal of the guanidine group of Arg-268, since the -CH2CH2SCH3 of methionine should be fairly isosteric with the -CH2CH2CH2NH2 of arginine(42Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11548-11558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although there probably would be changes in the solvation state upon the removal of the positively charged arginine (43). Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus NADPH concentration at four fixed levels of DL-glyceraldehyde concentrations show intersecting lines for R268M (Fig. 2A). This pattern is consistent with a sequential mechanism for R268M-hALR2. The pattern observed for WT-hALR2 consisted of parallel lines which is usually indicative of a double displacement mechanism (data not shown). However, it was shown previously that this pattern results from the tight interaction of NADPH to the enzyme, since the KIA was very low(9Grimshaw C.E. Shahbaz M. Putney C.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9947-9955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 44Ryle C.M. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the term KIAKB in Equation 1 tended to approach zero, creating a tendency for the lines to show a parallel pattern(44Ryle C.M. Tipton K.F. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The fact that the mutant enzyme showed converging lines for the initial velocity experiments indicated that the KIA term was no longer as low as in the case for the WT-hALR2. Initial velocity experiments were also carried out with NADH as the variable coenzyme substrate for both the WT and R268M-hALR2. Not surprisingly, the patterns observed (converging lines) were consistent with a sequential mechanism for the reduction of DL-glyceraldehyde. Product inhibition studies confirmed that the WT-hALR2 followed an ordered, sequential mechanism. NADP+ gave a linear competitive inhibition pattern with NADPH as the variable substrate, and DL-glyceraldehyde concentration held at a constant and saturating level. In the case of R268M, both oxidized coenzymes inhibited competitively against their reduced counterparts. Therefore, it appears that the overall mechanism for the recombinant WT-hALR2 was Ordered Bi-Bi and that this was not altered by substitution of the arginine residue to a methionine. Since the mutation had not affected the kinetic mechanism, it was possible to obtain and compare the kinetic constants kcat, Km, kcat/Km, and KI for both enzymes. The kinetic constants for WT and R268M are summarized in, along with the x-fold change in these constants as a result of the R268M mutation. According to the criteria suggested by Tsai and Yan(45Tsai M-D. Yan H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6806-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), when perturbations in kinetic parameters are ≤5-fold, the mutated residue is considered to be nonessential or unimportant to catalysis. When perturbations are ≥20-fold, the mutated residue is considered to play a functional role provided the conformation of the mutant enzyme is not significantly perturbed relative to WT (in the free form and in complexes with substrates). Changes between 5- and 20-fold should be interpreted"

Previous attempts to increase the biopotency of GH by increasing its site 1 affinity have been unsuccessful, which has led to a bias toward engineering site 2 interactions in the quest for creation of super agonists. Here we report that increasing site 1 affinity can markedly increase proliferative bioactivity in FDC-P1 cells expressing full-length GHR. In contrast, we find three site 1 mutants with affinities for site one similar to or greater than wild type GH, which have markedly decreased bioactivity. Through crystal structure analysis of the receptor interactive regions of these GH analogues, we are able to suggest why previous mutagenesis on human GH failed to improve biopotency, and thus provide a new avenue for GH and cytokine agonist design.

Improvement in the efficacy of GHs is dependent on an understanding of the molecular basis of GHR (GHR) binding, and the most significant studies delineating this interaction have come from Wells et al.(3Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Fuh G. Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Mulkerrin M.G. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 253-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with those studies, the crystal structure of the GH(GHR)2 complex shows the hormone to contain two separate binding sites for the GHR(4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). For the propagation of a biological response there is a requirement for sequential binding of the first receptor subunit to site 1 of GH, followed by binding of the second receptor subunit to site 2 to form the GH(GHR)2 complex(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because of its role in promoting formation of the biologically effective receptor dimer, the site 2 interaction is thought to be critical in regulation of the biological response(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Hormone binding site 2 involves residues in the N terminus of GH as well as side chains in helix 3, while site 1 has been proposed to consist of four discontinuous segments, namely the central part of helix 1, residues 38-47 and 54-74, and the C terminus of helix 4(4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 6Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The C terminus of helix 1 has consistently been overlooked as an interactive epitope in mutagenesis studies (7Cunningham B.C. Jhurani P. Ng P. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 243: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 8Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) despite its proximity to receptor 1 in the crystal structure. We have recently shown this region to be an important site 1 binding domain and to be largely responsible for the contrasting Ca2+ dependence of binding of non-primate and primate GHs to the rabbit GHR(9Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J.

Despite these advances there have been no reports of GH analogues that show enhanced bioactivity, although a human GH (hGH) that exhibits a 30-fold increased site 1 affinity has been produced(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The failure of this hGH analogue to show a commensurate increase in efficacy disagrees with conventional pharmacological theory, which predicts that increased receptor occupancy should translate to an increased biological response (10, 11), a concept supported by computer simulations of the biological response to GH binding(12Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This disagreement has not been resolved, although it was suggested by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) that further analysis of the on and off rates of hormone binding may elucidate the issue. Because this high affinity analogue did not have improved biopotency, it was proposed that the rate-limiting step in the biological response was site 2 binding and that in order to create analogues with higher efficacy, modification of binding site 2 was required(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In addressing the above issues, we have based our studies on the myeloid line used by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) but rather than their mG-CSF/hGH chimeric receptor, we have stably transfected the cells with a full-length GHR. This alleviates concerns about the ability of the chimeric mG-CSF/hGHR to accurately represent the physiological signaling mechanism. Using this assay system, we provide support for our previous findings regarding the importance of the C terminus of helix one as a receptor interactive epitope. In addition, we show that mutations in this region and at a site in the center of helix 4 substantially decrease the biopotency even though they do not adversely affect the affinity of binding to site one. From inspection of the crystal structure, we suggest that two regions of the receptor, the hinge region linking domains 1 and 2 and the final β-turn before the membrane, may be important regions that mediate transmission of the biological signal. We also report that deletion of the 8 C-terminal residues containing the small disulfide loop results in a pGH analogue with increased site 1 affinity and biological potency. This indicates that improvements to site 1 binding can result in substantial gains in bioactivity, in contrast to previously accepted views(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Human GH, pGH, and pGH analogues were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described in Refs. 9 and 13. L127V 2Mutations are designated by the wild type residue (in single-letter amino acid code) followed by the position and the mutant residue. bovine GH was a gift from Monsanto (Chesterfield Village, MO), while oPRL-16 was from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (Baltimore, MD). Far-UV CD spectra were performed on all pGHs, and no measurable change in α-helical content was seen between wild type pGH and pGH analogues. CD spectra are not shown but were identical to those previously reported(13Bastiras S. Wallace J.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9304-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA sequencing, all analogue pGHs underwent mass spectrometry to verify the incorporation of the desired mutational changes. Protein concentration of mutants was obtained by laser densitometric scan of silver-stained gels and by amino acid analysis. FDC-P1 cells are an IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line(14Hapel A.J. Warren H.S. Hume D.A. Blood. 1984; 64: 786-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and along with IL-3 were a gift from Andrew Hapel (John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian Capital Territory, Australia). Cells were routinely passaged in 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37°C, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with gentamicin at 1 μg/ml, 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), (from Life Technologies, Inc., Glen Waverly, Victoria, Australia) containing IL-3 at 50 units/ml. FDC-P1 cells were grown to mid-confluence and transfected by a method modified from Ref. 15. In brief, to a 0.4-cm cuvette was added 5 × 106 FDC-P1 cells in 200 μl of growth media and 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 μg of pCIS2.RGHR1 DNA (16Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachaines G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) in 50 μl of PBS. Cells were electroporated at 960 microfarads and 300 V with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus connected to a capacitance extender (Bio-Rad Laboratories Pty. Ltd., North Ryde, Australia). After electroporation the cells were placed in a 25-cm2 flasks containing 10 ml of fresh growth media supplemented with 50 units of IL-3/ml. Cells were left for 36-48 h (to allow GHR expression), after which they were transferred to growth medium devoid of IL-3 but containing 40 ng/ml hGH. GH selection was continued for 2 weeks with medium changes at 48-72-h intervals. Stably transfected lines were then cloned by repeated limiting dilution in the presence of 40 ng/ml hGH. This cell proliferation assay was originally developed for the spectrophotometric quantification of cell growth and viability (17Mossmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45822) Google Scholar) and so provides a rapid and convenient means by which the proliferation of GH-dependent cell lines can be assessed in response to the addition of mutant GHs. GH-dependent FDC-P1 cells (clone FDC-P1-RGHR3B, stably expressing the rabbit GHR) were grown to mid-confluence in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS, 40 ng/ml hGH, and 1 μg/ml gentamicin and washed by pelleting cells at 500 × g for 5 min, aspirating the medium, and resuspending in the same volume of sterile PBS. This step was repeated twice to ensure the removal of all free hGH. The cells were then resuspended in phenol red-free RPMI 1640, 5% FCS with 1 μg/ml gentamicin, diluted to a final concentration of 8 × 105 cells/ml, and 50 μl of this suspension was dispensed into each well of a 96-well plate. This was followed by 100 μl of appropriately diluted hormone made up in the same medium. One plate was used to assay each mutant, with the plate divided in half to allow a within plate comparison with wild type pGH. Eight GH concentrations were used per assay, allowing each GH concentration to be assessed in sextuplicate. Plates were placed without lids (to maintain uniform gas exchange) in a humidified chamber for 20-24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, after which 50 μl of 4 mg/ml MTT was added and the plates left for another 3-4 h(18Tada H. Shiho O. Kuroshima K. Koyama M. Tsukamoto K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 93: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by lysing the cells in 120 μl of isopropanol with trituration, and plates were stored in the dark at 22°C for 10 min before reading the absorbance at 595 nm in a microplate reader (model 450, Bio-Rad). Some of our pGH analogues (K30Q R34E pGH, K30E R34E pGH, and H170D pGH; numbering system used is in accord with Ref. 19) have been shown to be divalent metal ion (Me2+)-dependent in binding to the rabbit GHR(9Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Barnard R. Waters M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and since phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium was calculated to contain 125 mM Me+ (120 mM Na+ and 5 mM K+) and 0.8 mM Me2+ (0.4 mM Ca2+ and 0.4 mM Mg2+), it was possible that this was insufficient to achieve maximal binding and therefore a maximal mitogenic response. For this reason each of the Me2+-dependent pGH analogues and pGH were assayed in the presence or absence of an additional 2 mM MgCl2. Curve fitting was performed by linear regression using the DeltaGraph package for Macintosh desktop computers (Delta Point, Inc., Monterey, CA). The ED50 was calculated after subtracting the base line from a maximal GH dose, this being 900 ng/ml for pGH assays and 450 ng/ml for bGH, hGH, and C181S del 184-191 pGH assays (Fig. 3). Cell proliferation assays using [3H]thymidine were set up in an identical fashion to the MTT assays. The cells were incubated for 14-16 h in the presence of hormone prior to pulsing with 0.5 mCi of [3H]thymidine in 50 μl of RPMI 1640, 5% FCS, 1 μg/ml gentamicin for 5-6 h before harvesting on a Titer Tek cell harvester (Flow Laboratories, ICN Biomedicals Pty. Ltd., Seven Hills, New South Wales, Australia). Glass filters were counted on a Packard 1900 CA β spectrometer with quench correction. Affinity values for bGH and all pGH analogues were assessed using rabbit liver microsomes as described in Ref. 9. For determination of hGH affinity for receptors expressed in the FDC-P1 cell line, 125I-labeled hGH was displaced by increasing dilutions of unlabeled hGH. The number of surface-expressed rabbit GHRs in the transfected line was determined by growing 500 ml of confluent FDC-P1-RGHR3B cells in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FCS, 1 μg/ml gentamicin, and either 40 ng/ml hGH or 100 units/ml IL-3. Cells were pelleted and washed in the same manner as described above. The pellet was finally resuspended in 4 ml of isotonic glucose binding buffer with 20 mM MgCl2 (IGBBM)(22Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To 12 × 75-mm glass tubes was then added 200 μl of IGBBM, 100 μl of 125I-hGH (approximately 200,000 cpm), 100 μl of unlabeled hGH at increasing dilutions, and finally 100 μl (2 × 107 and 2 × 106 cells/ml for those grown in GH and IL-3, respectively) of cells. Assays were shaken gently at 12°C (to prevent receptor internalization; Ref. 20) for 14 h and terminated by adding 2 ml of ice-cold IGBBM to each tube, followed by centrifugation for 25 min at 4°C at 1600 × g. Pellets were counted on an LKB 1274 γ spectrometer. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed as described previously(9Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Barnard R. Waters M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The identical assay procedure as described above was used to bind 125I-hGH to FDC-P1-RGHR3B cells prior to cross-linking, except that Tris was replaced by Hepes in the IGBBM assay buffer and 1.5 × 107 cells were incubated with 1 × 106 dpm of 125I-hGH in a final volume of 2 ml. Cross-linking was performed in the manner described by Barnard and Waters(23Barnard R. Waters M.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 237: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The complete co-ordinates for the hGH(hGHR extracellular)2 complex were kindly made available to us by A. De Vos and A. Kossiakoff. These were converted to the pGH(pGHR extracellular)2 complex by use of the homology package, and energy minimized using the Discover program (Biosym Technologies, San Diego, CA) as described in Ref. 9. The relative affinities of hGH and bGH were 2.4- and 3.5-fold greater, respectively, than pGH (Table I). Of the pGH analogues tested, the K30E R34E pGH, E33K pGH, and C181S del 184-191 pGH analogues showed a greater than 2-fold increase in affinity for the rabbit GHR relative to wild type pGH (2.4-, 2.1-, and 4.8-fold, respectively). The increased affinity of the K30E R34E pGH analogue relative to pGH was still evident when assayed under physiological conditions (1.8-fold increase), but was less than the increase in affinity obtained when binding was performed in 20 mM Mg2+. All other pGH analogues exhibited an affinity similar to wild type pGH (Table I).Table I:Combined affinity (Ka) and biopotency values for hGH, bGH, pGH, and pGH analogues Open table in a new tab Several clones of FDC-P1-RGHR cells were obtained, with each of these being able to specifically bind GH and showing a dose-response curve almost identical to that of selected FDC-P1-RGHR3B line (data not shown). Affinity cross-linking to the FDC-P1-RGHR3B cells with 125I-hGH revealed bands at around 65 and 116 kDa after subtraction of the hormone component (Fig. 1A). Scatchard analysis from 3 independent assays on this clone revealed 186 ± 12 GHRs/cell with an affinity of 7.6 ± 1.6 × 109M−1 when cells were supported with GH (Fig. 1B). When cells were supported with IL-3, the affinity of hGH for the GHR was similar, 9.69 ± 2.1 × 109M−1, however, the receptor number was increased to 2128 ± 230 receptors/cell (n = 3). Application of the MTT assay to the FDC-P1-RGHR3B cell line provided a fast, sensitive, and non-radioactive method for determining the bioactivity of GH analogues. In all cases the base-line (0 ng/ml) and maximal GH response to pGH and the test analogue were virtually identical, enabling an accurate assessment of the ED50. A value of 900 ng/ml was used to obtain the maximal GH response for pGH and helix 1 and 4 mutants, whereas 450 ng/ml was used for bGH, hGH, and the C181S del 184-191 pGH analogue, these values being in the center of the plateau in the bell-shaped curve (Fig. 2). Because each analogue was assayed against wild type pGH in the same plate, interassay variation was not a concern. The most significant reductions in biopotency of the pGH analogues were seen with K30Q R34E pGH, K30E R34E pGH, H170D pGH, and P6S pGH, which had 5, 7.7-, 3-, and 2-fold reductions respectively in potency compared with wild type pGH. In contrast, bGH, hGH, and C181S del 184-191 pGH showed increased biopotency compared with wild type pGH (Table I). All other pGH analogues had similar biopotency to wild type pGH. The addition of 2 mM Mg2+ to the growth medium elevated nonspecific growth and thus the assay base line at 0 ng/ml; however, the ED50 for all of the hormones tested under this condition was not significantly different from that obtained in the control assay performed in the absence of additional Mg2+ (Table I). Over a GH range from 0 to 3 × 105 ng/ml, a bell-shaped dose-response curve was seen with the [3H]thymidine assay (Fig. 2A) as reported by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), similar to that seen with the MTT assay (Fig. 2B). This assay also shows the higher potency of hGH compared to pGH, and the fact that inhibition of cell proliferation at the highest hormone concentrations was more pronounced with hGH than with pGH. To facilitate the identification of non-primate GH agonists and antagonists, we have developed a sensitive in vitro assay system based on GH-dependent survival of the murine myeloid precursor cell line, FDC-P1. This line normally requires IL-3 for proliferation but has been shown by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) to convert to GH dependence upon stable transfection with a hybrid receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the hGHR and the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the murine G-CSF receptor. Use of this assay system (5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) provided support for the proposal that hormone-induced dimerization is required for signal transduction by the GHR, in agreement with the demonstration that GH has two binding sites, each binding a separate GHR molecule(4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 6Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Unfortunately the assay system of Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) did not utilize the full-length GHR, which raises doubts about the validity of derived biopotency data since this construct will not express the physiological signaling molecule (i.e. does not include the GHR cytoplasmic domain). Moreover, this assay system is restricted to use with primate GHs as a result of the inability of non-primate GHs to bind to primate GHRs. By developing a bioassay system based on the full-length rabbit GHR, we have overcome these limitations. Our stably transfected FDC-P1-RGHR cells have 186 ± 12 receptors/cell when grown in GH and 2128 ± 230 receptors/cell when grown in IL-3. The latter number is approximately 2 times greater than the number of expressed hybrid receptors reported by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Affinity cross-linking of the rabbit GHR expressed in this cell line revealed 65- and 116-kDa bands (Fig. 1A), a result consistent with the presence of cleaved GH-binding protein and full-length GHR(24Spencer S.A. Hammonds R.G. Henzel W.J. Rodriguez H. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7862-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis (Fig. 1B) showed the affinity of hGH for these receptors to be 7.6 ± 1.6 × 109M−1 and 9.6 ± 2.1 × 109M−1 when the cells were grown in GH and IL-3, respectively, similar to the values of Gobius et al.(22Gobius K.S. Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Mattick J.S. Waters M.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 9: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Leung et al.(16Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachaines G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), who transiently expressed the identical rabbit GHR construct in COS-7 cells. We have used the MTT cell proliferation assay, which allows rapid and convenient spectrophotometric quantification of cell growth and viability(17Mossmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45822) Google Scholar), to compare the biopotency of our pGH analogues with wild type pGH (Table I). Contrary to the view of Fuh et al. (5), a marked gain in biopotency can be achieved through higher affinity site 1 interaction, as evidenced by the C181S del 184-191 pGH analogue. It was observed in the alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of Cunningham and Wells (8Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar) that alanine substitution at Glu-186 and Ser-188 increased affinity, while alanine substitution at Gly-187 decreased it. These results indicate that smaller side chains at this location are more advantageous for receptor binding, and that larger residues cause steric hindrance. Accordingly, Seely et al. (25) reported that loss of the disulfide bond between Cys-181 and Cys-189 (C181N C189S pGH and a reduced form of pGH) resulted not only in an analogue that was less likely to aggregate, but one that displayed increased affinity for GHRs. We have made a pGH analogue devoid of the 8 C-terminal residues, and also find increased affinity for binding to rabbit liver GHR (4.8-fold,). However, our C181S del 184-191 pGH analogue shows a 5.2-fold increased bioactivity compared to wild type pGH in the cell proliferation assay (and Fig. 3). On the basis of CD spectra, the loss of the C terminus has not caused significant conformational changes in the GH structure (results not shown), while energy minimization calculations on the mutated analogue reveal little predicted change (less than 1Å) in the overall backbone structure, so no conformational change appears to have been induced at binding site 2. In the crystal structure the C terminus is too distant from site 2 to interact directly, so we conclude that increased site 1 affinity increases biopotency, in accord with the theoretical simulations of Ilondo et al.(12Ilondo M.M. Damholt A.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. De Meyts P. Shymko R.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2397-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In an attempt to create further pGH analogues with improved biopotency, we targeted P6 because bGH had a 3-fold higher biopotency compared to pGH and this was one of the few side chains that differed from bGH in the N terminus. This mutation resulted in a 2-fold loss in biopotency without adverse affects on site 1 affinity (Table I), indicating this residue is not responsible for the improved potency of bGH. Additionally, our finding is consistent with the observation of Cunningham and Wells (6Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) that this side chain is a site 2 determinant. Two of our analogues are seen to have site 1 affinities and biopotencies similar to pGH. The K139E change is in the floppy loop region between helices 3 and 4, while the K180A mutation is at the end of helix 4. Neither of these side chains are in close contact with either GHR1 or GHR2; therefore, these pGH analogues act as convenient controls. The greatest decreases in biopotency were seen with the K30Q R34E (5-fold) and K30E R34E pGHs (7.7-fold), even though their affinities for the receptor were not reduced. Similarly, the H170D analogue has wild type affinity but a 3-fold reduction in biopotency. These mutations involve interactions with the GHR at site 1(9Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since the binding assay measures the affinity of binding site 1 only(6Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. Abraham M. DeVos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), it follows that the loss in bioactivity seen with these mutants must be a result of unfavorable site 2 interactions, induced either by direct interaction with GHR2 or indirectly through a conformational change in the GH/GHR1 complex that is disadvantageous to receptor 2 binding (i.e. to receptor dimerization). We do not favor the former of these proposals because analysis of the crystal structure (4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) reveals that the closest contact between side chain head groups in the C terminus of helix 1 of GH and GHR2 is 14.1 Å and 12.2 Å between Lys-30 and Arg-34 of pGH and Gln-166 of GHR2, respectively, while His-170 sits in the middle of the site 1 interface(8Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). These contacts are too distant to have a significant effect on site 2 binding, and since all side chains are solvent exposed, it is unlikely that mutations at these positions would induce a conformational change in the hormone. Since energy minimization of these analogues reveals no difference in their overall structures compared to the wild type pGH, direct effects on the site 2 interaction are difficult to envisage, thus unfavorable interactions are most likely to occur through site 1. We have shown previously that pGH residues Lys-30, Glu-34, and His-170 are in reasonably close contact (between 4 and 7 Å) with Glu-126, Glu-127, and Glu-220 of the GHR(9Rowlinson S.W. Barnard R. Bastiras S. Robins A.J. Senn C. Wells J.R.E. Brinkworth R. Waters M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11724-11733Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that these and closely associated side chains may be important mediators of signaling through the GHR. The Glu-126 and Glu-127 side chains are unique in that they are within the 4-residue segment linking domain 1 and 2 of the extracellular portion of the GHR (Fig. 4A). This segment was proposed by De Vos et al.(4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) to be involved in orientating domain 1 and to be the primary reason why domain positioning differs from that seen with the homologous immunoglobulin domains. Indeed, the importance of this hinge region in domain orientation was further highlighted upon the release of the hGH/prolactin receptor crystal structure (26Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) as superimposing the hGH/hGHR complex onto the hGH/human prolactin receptor complex showed a significant difference in domain orientation of the homologous PRL and GH receptors. A Glu → Tyr change in the hinge region at position 127 was assigned as essentially responsible for the domain shift. Glu-220 is positioned directly after the β-bend connecting strands F and G in domain 2 (4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). This β-bend protrudes upward, away from the cell surface and toward the hormone, forming the bottom of a “cupped hands” configuration that holds the GH molecule in the GH(GHR)2 complex. Significantly, there is a difference in β-loop structure that is observed when GHR1 and GHR2 are superimposed (Fig. 5). The β-loop in GHR1 appears to have collapsed as a result of the interaction with GH side chains, principally His-21 and Glu-173, suggesting a hormone-induced conformational change (this is analogous to the conformational change observed in the loop comprising residues 163-168 of the hGHR(4De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar)). Since this β-bend is the last turn before the extracellular domain of the GHR inserts into the plasma membrane, it is plausible that this conformational change is involved in initiation of the biological response. We suggest that the loss of bioactivity associated with the K30Q R34E, K30E R34E pGH, and H170D pGH analogues is due to unfavorable interactions within either or both of the locations discussed above. Since the GH molecule interacts with GHR1 at the hinge region (Glu-126/Glu-127) and the F/G β-bend (Asn-218 and Glu-220) in the second domain of pGHR1, it seems likely that the measured angle between domains 1 and 2 of GHR1 in the GH/GHR complex is modulated by these interactions (Fig. 4B). The angles between the two domains in hGHR1 and hGHR2 differ considerably, and this is a reflection on the different modes of binding of these subunits with the GH molecule. The mutated side chains that interact with the hinge region and β-bend could induce a small movement that manifests a large change in the orientation of receptor domain 2, in much the same way as Tyr-127 is responsible for the difference in domain orientation between the hGH and PRL receptors. A change in the orientation of domain 2 relative to domain 1 in the GHR could affect its ability to dimerize with the identical domain in GHR2. Similarly, an unfavorable displacement of the β-bend could also effect dimerization analogously, or as suggested by crystal structure evidence (Fig. 5), induce an unfavorable conformational change that is transmitted to the submembrane domain, which thereby influences signaling. In support of this proposal, we have recently shown that mutation of Tyr-222 (at the base of the β-bend) to Ala results in complete loss in signal transduction despite only a 5-fold decrease in affinity for hormone(27Baumgartner J.W. Wells C.A. Chen C.-M. Waters M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29094-29101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conformational changes of this type could explain why the high affinity hGH analogue (H21A R64K E174A hGH) of Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) did not have enhanced biopotency, as two of the three mutations (H22A and E173A if using the numbering system of Ref. 28) used to increase site 1 affinity are juxtaposed to the conformation-sensitive region described here. His-22 and Glu-173 are both in close contact with the β-bend in domain 2 of the receptor (Fig. 3B). The conversion of these side chains to Ala would decrease the chances of inducing the above mentioned conformational change in the β-bend. Close contact with the β-bend is also an important in the interaction between hGH and the homologous prolactin receptor, as the histidines in helix 1 and Glu-173 in helix 4 of hGH and histidine 218 in the PRL receptor are involved in zinc chelation(26Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 29Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we propose the mutations used by Fuh et al.(5Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) to make their 30-fold higher affinity hGH analogue were inappropriate for demonstrating the relationship between higher site 1 affinity and biopotency. In conclusion, our binding and biological activity data show that care must be taken in the design of binding site 1 GH analogues, as it is possible to adversely affect biological activity without loss of site 1 binding affinity. Through analysis of the crystal structure of the GH(GHR)2 complex we suggest that there are two regions on the receptor (the hinge region between domains 1 and 2, and the β-bend) that are conformationally sensitive and important for signal transduction. Confirmation of this hypothesis is required through further mutagenic analysis of the hGH/hGHR interactions or through crystallization of a non-primate GH/GHR complex. Importantly, however, this study shows that it is possible to make analogues of GH that have increased site 1 affinity with a commensurate increase in biopotency. This is consistent with pharmacologic theory and indicates that conventional theory does apply to situations where receptor dimerization is necessary for signal transduction. This realization calls for a re-examination of approaches used in the design of more potent GHs and of members of the structurally homologous cytokine family(28Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis was used to determine the affinity of each GH and was performed as in Ref. 9. The biopotency of the GHs relative to pGH was determined as described inFig. 1. One plate was used to assay each mutant, with the plate divided in half to allow a within plate comparison with wild type pGH. Eight GH concentrations were used per assay, allowing each GH concentration to be assessed in sextuplicate. Because some of the pGH analogues have been shown to be Ca2+-dependent (9), additional Mg2+ was supplemented to the growth medium to ensure a maximal mitogenic response. Each analogue underwent Scatchard and biopotency analysis a minimum of three times; S.E. is indicated. The values in parentheses are the decreases in bioactivity relative to wild type pGH. *, p < 0.05;**, p < 0.01 indicate significant change relative to pGH.

The epicuticular wax constitutes almost 20% of the chloroform-extractable lipids in developing leek leaf and is derived predominantly from saturated fatty acids. The significant requirement for saturated fatty acids in epidermal tissues led us to investigate whether or not epidermal extracts have thioesterase activities that prefer saturated acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) substrates, rather than the 18:1-ACP more commonly hydrolyzed by total leaf extracts. Epidermal extracts from Brassica, pea, and leek exhibited higher activities toward saturated acyl-ACPs relative to 18:1-ACP when compared to total leaf or leaf parenchymal extracts.

In most plant tissues, the primary products of de novo fatty acid synthesis are the mono-unsaturated fatty acid oleate (C18:1) and, to a much lesser extent, the saturated fatty acids, palmitate (C16:0), and stearate (C18:0). The acyl chains are synthesized in plastids esterified to the protein cofactor, acyl carrier protein (ACP).1 1The abbreviations used are: ACPacyl carrier proteinDTTdithiothreitolMCTEmedium chain acyl-ACP thioesteraseOTEoleoyl-ACP thioesteraseSTEstearoyl-ACP thioesteraseFPLCfast performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMOPS2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidbis-Trisbis[2-hydroxyethyl]imino-tris[hydroxymethyl] methanedpmdisintegrations/mingfwgrams fresh weight.

The designation of Cx:y for fatty acids and their derivatives indicate chain lengths of x carbons long and with y number of double bonds. The plastidial extension of an acyl chain is terminated by hydrolysis or transfer of the acyl chain from ACP, either before or after desaturation, and therefore, the terminal steps of plastidial de novo fatty acid synthesis determine the proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids produced. The free fatty acids are exported out of the plastid and subsequently esterified to coenzyme A. These acyl-CoAs are the substrates for membrane and storage lipid synthesis, and in the case of epidermal cells, they may be further elongated to very long chain fatty acids (C20 to C30 and greater) for production of epicuticular wax.The control mechanisms directing termination of de novo fatty acid synthesis, and therefore defining the pools of various acyl-CoA precursors, are not well understood. The acyl-CoA pools may be controlled, in part, by the substrate specificities of acyl-ACP hydrolases (thioesterases). For example, in a variety of oilseeds, such as California Bay (Umbellularia california) and Cuphea, medium chain fatty acids (the major acyl components of the storage triacylglycerols), are the products of medium chain acyl-ACP thioesterases(1Davies H.M.

In addition, transformation of Arabidopsis with a medium chain thioesterase (under the direction of a seed-specific napin promoter) produces high quantities of medium chain fatty acids in seed triacylglycerols(3Voelker T.A.

Oleate is then released by a specific oleoyl-ACP hydrolase (or thioesterase, OTE) (EC 3.1.2.14). Although this enzyme prefers oleoyl-ACP, it also has activity (10-20%) with palmitoyl-ACP and stearoyl-ACP substrates(8Ohlrogge J.B. Shine W.E. Stumpf P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12141-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hellyer A.

There has been speculation that the minor pools of palmitic and stearic acids in whole leaf tissue are generated by OTE and its reduced specificity for palmitoyl- and stearoyl-ACPs. However, leek epidermal tissue which constitutes only 4% of the leaf fresh weight is solely responsible for wax production which is more than 15% of the total leaf lipid. Furthermore, the wax is derived almost exclusively from saturated fatty acids. Therefore, while the minor OTE activity may be sufficient for generating saturated fatty acid pools in whole leaves, it is unlikely that it is sufficient to supply the saturated fatty acids required for wax biosynthesis by epidermal cells.In order to determine if epidermal tissue has thioesterases which are specific for, or have a greater preference for, saturated acyl-ACPs, we compared thioesterase activities in total leaf and in epidermal tissue extracts prepared from Brassica, pea, and leek. From these initial studies we have discovered an epidermal stearoyl-ACP thioesterase. This enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and shown to be highly specific for 18:0-ACP. It is expressed primarily, if not exclusively in epidermal tissue, and may be responsible, in part, for generating the saturated fatty acid precursor pools for epicuticular wax production.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlant MaterialsFresh leeks (Allium porrum) were obtained at a local grocery store and the leaves were removed ∼5-10 cm above the root stock with a razor blade. The leek bulbs were then planted in Metro Mix (Grace/Sierra) potting soil such that the roots were buried to a depth of approximately 2.5-3.5 cm. The epidermis of the cut leaves was peeled in wide strips with a pair of fine-tipped forceps and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The remaining parenchyma was frozen separately. These tissues were defined as “mature.” The planted leeks were placed in a growth chamber (50% humidity and 16 h photoperiod) and later used as a source of rapidly expanding “regenerated” leaf. Epidermis and parenchyma of the regenerated leaf were harvested after 10-14 days, as described for mature tissue. All samples were stored at −70°C until used.Total leaf samples from Brassica campestris and pea (Pisum sativum, A783-161, arg+, Norman Weeden, Cornell University) were harvested from growth chamber-grown plants (50% humidity, 16 h photoperiod) and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Epidermal tissues were peeled from stems of 6-10-week-old Brassica plants or from leaves of 3-6-week-old pea plants and frozen as described above.ChemicalsRecombinant spinach ACP-I and Escherichia coli ACP were isolated from E. coli E103S, a gift from J. B. Ohlrogge, and purified using DEAE-cellulose chromatography according to Clough et al.(12Clough R.C. Matthis A.L. Barnum S.R. Jaworski J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20992-20998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of ACP was essentially pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and visualization by Coomassie staining (data not shown). [1-14C]Acyl-ACPs were synthesized from [1-14C]fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, and oleic acid, SA 2.1 GBq/mmol, Dupont-NEN) and plant or E. coli ACP with E. coli acyl-ACP synthetase 13. Over 90% of the ACP was routinely acylated by this procedure. The [1-14C]acyl-ACPs were purified by DE52-cellulose (Whatman) chromatography and desalted with a Microdialyzer System 500 (Pierce) against 20 mM MOPS buffer, pH 6.1. [1-14C]Stearoyl-CoA was prepared according to Taylor et al.(14Taylor D.C. Weber N. Hogge L.R. Underhill E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).ACP (10 mg) was bound to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to Clough et al.(12Clough R.C. Matthis A.L. Barnum S.R. Jaworski J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20992-20998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before use, the ACP affinity column was incubated for 15 min with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mM DTT to ensure the ACP phosphopanthetheine prosthetic group was fully reduced, and then equilibrated with 10 ml of 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100.Enzyme AssaysAcyl-ACP thioesterases activities were assayed as described(8Ohlrogge J.B. Shine W.E. Stumpf P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Assays were performed under initial velocity conditions, with less than 10% of substrate typically hydrolyzed. The assay for acyl-ACP hydrolysis contained 1.0 μM [1-14C]acyl-ACP, and the incubation was for 15 min at 37°C. One unit of thioesterase activity was defined as 1 nmol of fatty acid hydrolyzed/min/mg protein under the assay conditions. Stearoyl-CoA thioesterase activity was assayed under identical conditions except 1 μM [1-14C]stearoyl-CoA was used in place of [1-14C]acyl-ACP. Protein concentration was measured using a Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's recommendations.After some assays the hexane-extracted radioactive products were dried under a gentle stream of N2, dissolved in a small volume (∼50 μl) of chloroform and separated by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel plate (J. T. Baker Si250 (19C)) using hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70:30:1 (v/v/v)) as the developing solvent. The radiolabeled product was visualized after exposure to x-ray film (Kodak X-OMAT AR) and was found to comigrate with the free fatty acid standard ([1-14C]18:0). The radiolabeled band was scraped, eluted from the silica gel with chloroform, and applied to a reversed phase (Whatman KC18) plate to determine the chain length of the product. Radiolabeled standards ([1-14C]12:0, [1-14C]14:0, [1-14C]16:0, [1-14C]18:0) were used to identify the chain length of the product band by comigration. The products of all thioesterase assays were free fatty acids whose chain lengths were identical to the chain lengths of the added acyl-ACP substrates.Purification of a Saturated Acyl-ACP ThioesteraseStep 1All purification steps were carried out at 4°C. Frozen leek epidermis (70-200 g) was ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen using a prechilled mortar and pestle. The powder was added to 10 volumes of ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT, plus protease inhibitors (0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 μM pepstatin, 100 μM phosphoramidon), and 5% (w/v) water-insoluble polyvinylpolypyrolidone, and the sample was homogenized with a polytron. After homogenization Triton X-100 (Pierce Surfact-Amps X-100) was added to a final concentration of 0.01% (v/v). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered through miracloth and centrifuged again for 30 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the proteins were precipitated with 75% ammonium sulfate, collected by centrifugation, and redissolved in 30 ml of Buffer A (20 mM KPO4, pH 6.8, 2 mM DTT, containing the protease inhibitors as indicated above without the polyvinylpolypyrolidone). The resuspended extract was desalted by PD10 columns (Pharmacia) using Buffer A.Step 2The sample was loaded onto a Bio-Gel HT hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad, 5 × 100 cm) column which had been equilibrated with 20 mM KPO4, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 1 bed volume of Buffer A to remove unbound proteins. The saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase was then eluted with 2 bed volumes 0.1 M NaCl in Buffer A. OTE was eluted with 2 bed volumes (400 ml) 0.3 M KPO4. The active OTE fraction was not purified further. The active saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon PM-30 (Danvers, MA) ultrafiltration membrane. The sample was desalted with PD10 columns into 20 mM succinate buffer, pH 5.0, 2 mM DTT containing the protease inhibitors and 5% glycerol (Buffer B).Step 3Fifteen ml of concentrated protein were loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) which had been equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with Buffer B to remove unbound protein. The enzyme was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 400 mM] in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM DTT, containing the protease inhibitors and 5% glycerol. The active fractions were pooled, desalted in 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.5, and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 400 mM in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 2 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, and 5% glycerol. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100 buffer for ACP affinity chromatography.Step 4One bed volume (1 ml) of enzyme was loaded onto the ACP affinity column and allowed to incubate for 10-20 min at 4°C. The column was sequentially washed stepwise with Buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100) and then with 3 ml of 0.1 and 0.2 M NaCl in Buffer C to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase was eluted with 1.0 M NaCl in Buffer C. After dialysis against Buffer C, the sample was reapplied to the affinity column, bound, and eluted by the same procedure. Saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase was purified to homogeneity (as determined by silver-staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels) after the second elution from the column.FPLC Mono P ChromatographyThe active fractions from the Mono Q column were pooled and desalted with PD10 columns in Buffer D (25 mM bis-Tris, adjusted to pH 7.1 by iminodiacetic acid). The sample was applied to a Mono P column (HR 5/20) equilibrated with Buffer D, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4°C. The column was washed with Buffer D, and the activity was eluted with 60 ml of 10% (v/v) polybuffer 74 (Pharmacia) adjusted to pH 4.0 by iminodiacetic acid, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 50 μl of 1 M bis-Tris, pH 9.9, to immediately neutralize the eluant. Active fractions were concentrated and stored at −20°C.Determination of Native Molecular MassThe native molecular mass of the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase was determined using a Superdex 200 FPLC gel filtration column (HR 10/30, Pharmacia). The desalted active fraction from the Mono Q column was loaded onto the column which had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.10 M NaCl buffer and calibrated with the following standards: β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots were assayed for thioesterase activity. Only one peak of activity was detected.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot AnalysesProteins from each purification step were separated by SDS-PAGE (15) and stained using a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoblot analyses were performed as described by Post-Beittenmiller et al.(16Post-Beittenmiller M.A. Schmid K.M. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 889-899PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies used as the primary antibodies were raised against one of three thioesterases: 1) an Arabidopsis thioesterase with a broad substrate range from 14:0-ACP to 18:1-ACP(17Dörmann P. Frentzen M. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), 2) coriander OTE, and 3) California bay medium chain acyl-ACP thioesterase (MCTE). Both Arabidopsis and coriander thioesterase antibodies were kind gifts from Peter Dörmann and John Ohlrogge (Michigan State University), and the antibody to California bay MCTE was a kind gift from Toni Voelker (Calgene, Davis, CA).Fatty Acid and Wax AnalysesFatty acid methyl esters were prepared from frozen tissue using methanolic boron trichloride (10%, w/v, Alltech). Frozen tissue (100 mg) was ground in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle and added to 1 ml of methanolic boron trichloride. Heptadecanoic acid (Sigma) was added as an internal standard at a concentration of 300 ng/mgfw. The suspension was heated to 60-80°C for 1 h. After extraction into hexane and drying under a gentle stream of N2, samples were resuspended in 200 μl of hexane, and 1-μl aliquots were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 gas chromatograph and a 5971 mass spectrometer. Samples were separated using a DB23 (J& Scientific) 20 m × 180-μm capillary column. The injector temperature was 275°C, and the oven temperature was ramped at 10°C/min from 125 to 250°C. Total ion monitoring and comparison of retention times with standards were used to identify components.Wax was removed from leaf sections by dipping leaf tissue in CHCl3 for 20-30 s. Heptadecanoic acid was added as an internal standard. The solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. Samples were dissolved in hexane and analyzed directly, or an aliquot was treated with methanolic boron trichloride for analysis of fatty acid methyl esters. Waxes were analyzed using an HP5 30 m × 250 μm diameter capillary column. Injector was at 250°C and the oven ramped from 150 to 300°C at 5°C/min.RESULTSComparison of Acyl-ACP Thioesterase Activities from Different Plant SpeciesThe primary acyl-ACP thioesterase activity in total leaf is oleoyl-ACP thioesterase(8Ohlrogge J.B. Shine W.E. Stumpf P.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 2624-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). However, because of the increased requirement for very long chain saturated fatty acid precursors for epicuticular wax production, we postulated that epidermal tissues may have thioesterase activities which prefer saturated acyl-ACP substrates. Such activities could be due to either an OTE with a broad substrate range that includes hydrolysis of saturated fatty acids or a thioesterase specific for saturated fatty acids. We measured thioesterase activities in Brassica, pea, and leek tissues using 16:0-ACP, 18:0-ACP, and 18:1-ACP substrates to determine whether or not epidermal tissue was enriched for saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity when compared to total leaf. As shown in Fig. 1, the hydrolysis of 18:1-ACP was 3-5-fold higher than the hydrolysis of the saturated acyl-ACPs in total leaf extracts of Brassica, pea, or leek parenchymal tissue. Compared to total leaf, the epidermal extracts had higher thioesterase activity with saturated acyl-ACPs relative to 18:1-ACP. Leek epidermal extracts had the highest relative activities for the saturated substrates. Furthermore, the ratios of saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activities to 18:1-ACP activity were greater in leek epidermis than in leek parenchyma. Consequently, because of the relatively higher level of saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activities, the relative ease of peeling leek epidermis, and the higher level of wax production compared to either Brassica or pea, leeks were used for the further characterization of this activity.Purification of the Saturated Acyl-ACP ThioesteraseAn acyl-ACP thioesterase specific for saturated acyl-ACPs was purified to homogeneity from leek epidermis and shown to be distinct from 18:1-ACP thioesterase. A summary of the chromatography steps and the fold-purification are presented in Table I. The purification procedure was repeated five times with different amounts of starting material (70-200 g). Starting with 200 g, this procedure yielded approximately 3600-fold purification with a recovery of 1-2%. The saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase and OTE activities were followed by hydrolyses of 18:0-ACP and 18:1-ACP, respectively. The crude extract contains several thioesterases, each with some 18:0-ACP activity; therefore, the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity at all purification steps (beyond hydroxyapatite chromatography) was calculated based on the ratio of saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity to OTE activity with 18:0-ACP as the substrate. We estimated that 80% of the total 18:0-ACP hydrolysis can be attributed to OTE and/or other thioesterases. Because there are losses before the hydroxyapatite column, these are only estimates of the actual activities. Differential inactivation of the two thioesterases during purification may also affect these estimates.Table I:Purification of saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase from leek epidermis Open table in a new tab We initially compared PEG-8000 precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Approximately 50% of the total thioesterase activity was precipitated by 25% PEG, while over 90% of the total thioesterase activity was precipitated by 75% ammonium sulfate. Therefore, the latter was used as the initial purification step giving a 1.8-fold enrichment of total thioesterase specific activity, and an enrichment of 1.3% for the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity.We demonstrated that the hydroxyapatite-purified saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity was due to a separate enzyme, rather than an OTE with broad substrate specificity. This step reliably separated the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase and OTE thioesterase activities. When a linear NaCl gradient was used to separate the two thioesterase activities, resolution was poor, while a step-wise elution was found to be more efficient. After hydroxyapatite chromatography, the partially purified saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase had very low activity with 18:1-ACP (<10%), while the OTE fraction retained significant activity with both 18:0- and 16:0-ACPs (30-50% of the activity with 18:1-ACP).The saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase was further purified by FPLC Mono S and Mono Q chromatography and finally by ACP affinity chromatography. In some experiments the order of columns after hydroxyapatite chromatography was changed without significantly altering the final purification result. Fig. 2 shows a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel comparing enrichment of the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity during several steps of purification. The arrow indicates the band which corresponds to the single 40 kDa band after ACP affinity column chromatography. This 40 kDa band is consistently found in all active fractions when alternative chromatographic separations are used. Fig. 3 shows the final ACP affinity purification of the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase. After hydroxyapatite chromatography the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase activity was enriched only 20-fold (and Fig. 3A, lane 1). A further 500-fold enrichment was achieved with two ion-exchange columns. After Mono Q chromatography, many protein bands could still be detected; however, most of the proteins from Mono Q pooled fractions did not bind the ACP affinity column (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). After two passes through the ACP affinity column, the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase subunit was purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (Fig. 3B), giving rise to a single protein band at 40 kDa. The binding of the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase to the ACP affinity matrix was relatively weak as the 0.1 M NaCl eluted 40-50% of the activity (data not shown). Typically, about 50% of the applied thioesterase activity was released with 1.0 M NaCl.Figure 2:SDS-PAGE of samples from crude extract and from different column chromatography steps.

Comparison with elution times of standard proteins indicated that the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase had a native molecular mass of 84 kDa (Fig. 4). Comparison of the sizes of the saturated acyl-ACP thioesterase by SDS-PAGE and by gel filtration suggests that it may function as a dimer. This is similar to safflower OTE which has a subunit mass of 41 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and a molecular mass of 74 kDa as determined by gel filtration (9). Thioesterases from California bay (MCTE) and Cuphea (OTE) have similar molecular masses (42 and 53 kDa, respectively), while the Cuphea MCTE is slightly smaller, 28 kDa(1Davies H.M. Anderson L.

The effects of substitution mutations on calmodulin activation properties implicate 4 of the 8 basic residues between the catalytic core and the calmodulin-binding domain in maintaining autoinhibition. These residues are further amino-terminal to the basic residues comprising the previously proposed pseudosubstrate sequence and suggest involvement of the connecting region in intrasteric autoinhibition.The pseudosubstrate model for autoinhibition proposes that basic residues within the autoinhibitory region mimic basic residues in the substrate and bind to defined acidic residues within the catalytic core. Charge reversal mutations of these specific acidic residues, however, had little or no effect on the Km value for regulatory light chain. From a total of 20 acidic residues on the surface of the substrate binding lobe of the catalytic core, 7 are implicated in binding directly or indirectly to the autoinhibitory domain but not to the light chain. Only 2 acidic residues near the catalytic site may bind to the autoinhibitory domain and the arginine at P-3 in the light chain. Exposure of these 2 residues upon calmodulin binding may be necessary and sufficient for light chain phosphorylation.

Exposure of these 2 residues upon calmodulin binding may be necessary and sufficient for light chain phosphorylation. Activation of smooth/nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase by Ca2+/calmodulin results in phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain that plays important roles in initiation of smooth muscle contraction, endothelial cell retraction, secretion, and other cellular processes (32Stull J.T. Krueger J.K. Zhi G. Gao Z.-H. 1995 in International Symposium on Regulation of the Contractile Cycle in Smooth Muscle. April 26, 1995; (Mie, Japan, in press)Google Scholar). The smooth/nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase contains a catalytic core homologous to that of other protein kinases and a carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain consisting of both an inhibitory sequence and a calmodulin-binding sequence (11Hu S.-H.

Gao Z.-H. 1995 in International Symposium on Regulation of the Contractile Cycle in Smooth Muscle. April 26, 1995; (Mie, Japan, in press)Google Scholar). Initially, inspection of the linear sequence within the regulatory domain revealed a similar number and sequential arrangement of 4 basic residues with those shown to be important substrate determinants in a synthetic peptide containing residues 11-23 of the myosin regulatory light chain (see Fig. 1). Thus, 26Pearson R.B. Wettenhall R.E.H. Means A.R. Hartshorne D.J. Kemp B.E. Science. 1988; 241: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar proposed that the regulatory domain contained a pseudosubstrate inhibitory sequence whereby 4 specific basic residues in myosin light chain kinase mimic the basic substrate determinants in the light chain peptide substrate. Binding of the pseudosubstrate sequence to the active site inhibited activity. Intrasteric inhibition involves an autoinhibitory sequence that folds back on the catalytic site to inhibit kinase activity as opposed to an allosteric mechanism whereby a conformational change induced at a site distinct from the active site would be responsible for regulation of enzyme activity (17Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1094: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The sequence comprising the pseudosubstrate region was later expanded to include overlap with the complete amino terminus of the light chain (2Faux M.C. Mitchelhill K.I. Katsis F. Wettenhall R.E.H.

Limited tryptic cleavage of the chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase results in a nonactivatable form (64 kDa) that becomes constitutively active upon further digestion (61 kDa). Because of differences in the reported cleavage sites, there is disagreement on whether the inhibited form contains the pseudosubstrate sequence (26Pearson R.B. Wettenhall R.E.H. Means A.R.

Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that a lowered KCaM value reflected a weakened binding of the inhibitory region to the catalytic core. In this series of mutations, only 2 acidic residues, located near the catalytic site in the cleft between the two lobes of the kinase, were identified as binding to both the inhibitory region and the arginine residue at the P-3 position in the light chain substrate.A three-dimensional model has been proposed for the catalytic core of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, and a portion of the bound autoinhibitory region that includes the expanded pseudosubstrate sequence (22Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This model is based on the known crystal structure of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in complex with its inhibitory peptide, PKI. A substrate binding groove has been defined utilizing the position of the PKI peptide in the crystal structure of this complex (20Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is predicted that specific acidic residues lining this substrate-binding groove of the myosin light chain kinase catalytic core form salt bridges with basic residues in both the autoinhibitory sequence and the regulatory light chain substrate. Since the role of these acidic residues was not examined in a previous study (6Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have experimentally tested the predictions of this pseudosubstrate model using selected site mutagenesis to identify interacting residues. A modified molecular mechanism for autoinhibition is proposed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotide-directed MutagenesisA 1,660-base pair 5′-BamHI-XbaI-3′ cDNA fragment, representing the carboxyl-terminal half of rabbit smooth/nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase (5Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into M13 bacteriophage. Mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.) and oligonucleotides designed to produce mutant cDNAs having the desired substitutions. For each mutant cDNA, the desired nucleotide substitutions were verified by DNA sequencing (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar).Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Smooth Muscle Myosin Light Chain KinasesAll wild-type and mutant myosin light chain kinases were expressed in COS cells. In each case, two clones of each mutant were subcloned into a pCMV5 expression vector as described previously (5Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent expression was accomplished by transfection into COS cells using DEAE-dextran and chloroquine (9Herring B.P. Fitzsimons D.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16588-16591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Myosin Light Chain Kinase AssaysCOS cell lysates, prepared as described by 5Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, were used to determine recombinant wild-type and mutant myosin light chain kinase activity (5Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quantity of wild-type and mutant smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases present in COS cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting with purified smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase as a standard and probing with antiserum raised against the carboxyl-terminal telokin portion of rabbit smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (Gallagher and Herring, 1991). The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of wild-type and mutant smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases was measured by 32P incorporation into myosin regulatory light chain purified from chicken gizzards (Blumenthal and Stull, 1980). Ca2+/calmodulin-independent background activity of the extracts was measured as radioactivity incorporated in the presence of 3 mM EGTA. Vmax and Km values were determined from Lineweaver-Burke double-reciprocal plots after performing kinase assays under varying regulatory light chain concentrations.To examine the calmodulin activation properties of mutant myosin light chain kinases in COS cell lysates, Ca2+ activation assays were performed as described by Herring(1991). The relative KCaM values of the mutant kinases within the COS cell extracts were measured at 1 μM calmodulin with varying Ca2+ concentrations from 75 nM to 100 μM with a Ca2+/EGTA buffer system (27Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The added calmodulin is in great excess of the endogenous calmodulin contributed by the COS cell lysate and therefore provides controlled conditions to establish the relative concentrations of Ca2+/calmodulin required for kinase activation. The free Ca2+ concentration was the determinant of the actual Ca2+/calmodulin concentration. To assess the quantitative changes in the calmodulin activation properties (KCaM) of mutant myosin light chain kinases, the ratio of activities at Ca2+ concentrations that resulted in less than maximal activity to the maximal activity measured at 100 μM Ca2+ was determined as described previously (25Miller J.R. Silver P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar; 3Fitzsimons D.P. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ratio of activities at a specific Ca2+ concentration that is less than that required for maximal activity increases quantitatively as the KCaM value for a mutant myosin light chain decreases relative to the wild-type enzyme. Although the ratio of activities does not allow determination of the absolute value of KCaM, it may be used to calculate the -fold change in KCaM relative to wild-type myosin light chain kinase that has an average KCaM value of 1 nM (25Miller J.R. Silver P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar; 31Stull J.T. Hsu L.-C. Tansey M.G. Kamm K.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is proposed that a decrease in the KCaM value (<1 nM) reflects a more easily activated kinase due to a weakening of the binding between the inhibitory region and the catalytic core.RESULTSProperties of Myosin Light Chain Kinase Mutated in the Connection RegionTo further define the boundaries of myosin light chain kinase inhibitory sequence, we created charge reversal and alanine substitution point mutations at basic residues amino-terminal to the proposed pseudosubstrate region of myosin light chain kinase (Fig. 1) (19Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Guerriero Jr., V. Bagchi I.C. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2542-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA was constructed in the vector pCMV5 for transient expression in COS cells. Immunoblot analysis of COS cell lysates demonstrated that all of the mutant myosin light chain kinases were full-length and expressed at levels (5-20 μg/ml) similar to previously obtained results (3Fitzsimons D.P. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 6Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All active mutant myosin light chain kinases were dependent on Ca2+ for activity.The Ca2+/calmodulin activation properties of the wild-type and mutant kinases were determined by performing assays at a high calmodulin concentration with a Ca2+/EGTA buffer used to vary the free Ca2+ concentration and hence the Ca2+/calmodulin concentration (25Miller J.R. Silver P.J. Stull J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar). Lys953 is 21 residues amino-terminal to basic residues (Arg974-Lys979) in the calmodulin binding domain that form the core of the proposed pseudosubstrate structure (Fig. 1). Both K953D and K953A mutants required significantly less Ca2+ for half-maximal activation (0.26 and 0.42 μM, respectively) relative to wild-type kinase (0.65 μM) with corresponding decreases in KCaM (0.16 and 0.53 nM from 1.0 nM) (Table I and Fig. 2A). These mutations that produced a 6.3- and 1.9-fold decrease in KCaM values were not accompanied by any significant changes in catalytic properties (Table I). In contrast to these results, mutant K956E had no significant effects on Ca2+ activation or catalytic properties (Table I).Table I:Kinetic properties of myosin light chain kinase containing point mutations of basic residues within the regulatory domain Open table in a new tab Figure 2:Calcium activation curves for mutant myosin light chain kinases. Myosin light chain kinase mutants were expressed in COS cells, and activity was measured in cell lysates at 1 μM calmodulin at different Ca2+ concentrations. The data were normalized to the percent maximal activity. Symbols represent a mean value of at least three independent assays, each performed in duplicate. Data are presented without error bars for clarity. A, mutations within the regulatory domain of myosin light chain kinase are as follows: ●, wild-type; ○, K953D; □, K956E; △, K961E; ▽, K962E; ◇, R967E. B, mutations within the catalytic core of myosin light chain kinase are as follows: ●, wild-type; ○, E858Q; □, D896K; △, E900R; ◇, D911K/D914K. [Ca2+] values are 0.65 ± 0.02, 0.13 ± 0.02, 0.57 ± 0.05, 0.57 ± 0.03, and 0.78 ± 0.09 nM, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The K961E and K961A mutants required significantly less Ca2+ for half-maximal activation (0.30 and 0.31 μM) with 5- and 3.2-fold decreases in KCaM values, respectively (Table I). The charge reversal mutant K961E selectively changed the activation properties of the kinase with no change in Vmax or Km values (Table I). In contrast, the charge reversal and alanine substitution mutations of Lys962 had little effect on activation and catalytic properties. The Vmax and Km values were not changed for the charge reversal mutation. The Kmvalue for light chain was not measured for the alanine substitution, but the specific activity of the kinase was not different for wild-type enzyme. The charge reversal mutation K962E resulted in a modest decrease in [Ca2+] from 0.65 to 0.47 mM with only a 1.6-fold decrease in KCaM. By comparing these relative KCaM values with that previously reported (3Fitzsimons D.P. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the double mutant KK961/962EE (0.20 nM), it is evident that of these 2 residues, Lys961 is more sensitive to substitution.Individual substitution of basic residues Lys965 and Arg967 with oppositely charged acidic residues showed a marked decrease in KCaM value (0.03 and 0.09 nM, respectively) relative to the 1 nM value for wild-type kinase (Table I). These values can be compared with the previously reported values (3Fitzsimons D.P. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the individual alanine mutants K965A and R967A (0.11 and 0.25 nM) as well as the double mutants K965A/R967A and K965E/R967D (0.04 nM and inactive, respectively). None of the mutations caused significant changes in Vmax or Km values except for K965E in which the 33-fold decrease in KCaM was associated with lower Vmax and Km values (Table I) (3Fitzsimons D.P. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. Gallagher P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23903-23909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Properties of Myosin Light Chain Kinase Mutated in the Catalytic CoreAcidic residues Glu858, Asp896, Glu900, and Asp911 (corresponding residues for myosin light chain kinase from chicken smooth muscle are Glu681, Asp719, Glu723, and Asp734, respectively) within the myosin light chain kinase catalytic core are predicted by the proposed pseudosubstrate model to be involved in binding both the inhibitory sequence in the kinase and the regulatory light chain (22Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was tested by charge reversal mutations of these residues. Three neighboring acidic residues, Asp898, Asp913, and Asp914, were chosen as controls for the charge reversal mutation studies. These latter residues are found in the vicinity of those proposed to bind to both the autoinhibitory sequence and the regulatory light chain but are not predicted to bind to either light chain or the autoinhibitory sequence.The resulting mutant kinases were characterized with respect to catalytic and activation properties. One of the charge reversal mutants, E858K, was catalytically inactive (Table II) even though it was expressed at high levels and comigrated with the 152-kDa wild-type recombinant myosin light chain kinase (data not shown). A more conservative mutation, E858Q, resulted in the expression of an active kinase with Vmax, Km, and Vmax/Km ratio values similar to those of the wild-type kinase. E858Q did, however, require significantly less Ca2+ (0.13 μM) for half-maximal activation relative to the wild-type kinase (0.65 μM) with a 7-fold decrease in the KCaM value (, Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the binding of this residue to or near the inhibitory domain but not to the light chain.Table II:Kinetic properties of myosin light chain kinases containing catalytic core point mutations Open table in a new tab All of the other catalytic core mutants exhibited no significant changes in [Ca2+] and KCaM values from that of the wild-type kinase (, Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the interpretation that these acidic residues do not bind to basic residues in the autoinhibitory domain.Minor yet statistically significant increases in the Km values for regulatory light chain were observed for D896K, D898K, E900R, D911K/D914K, D911R, D913K, and D914K mutants (19.8, 19.3, 11.6, 33.7, 10.2, 9.6, and 16.0 μM, respectively, versus 4.7 μM for wild-type kinase). In several cases (E900R, D911R, D913K, and D914K) the changes were only about 2-fold and could result from nonspecific electrorepulsion rather than perturbation of specific salt bridge bonds between the respective residues in the catalytic core and the light chain. The Vmax values were similar to wild-type kinase except for D913K, which was lower (8.7 μmol of 32P incorporated per min/mg). The changes in the Vmax/Km ratios for the charge reversal mutants were also modest (Table II). The largest change was noted in the double mutant D911K/D914K (5.8-fold). However, single mutations in these residues resulted in only 1.7- and 2.4-fold changes.DISCUSSIONAs a result of previous mutational and deletion analysis of the myosin light chain kinase regulatory domain, some residues immediately amino-terminal to the calmodulin-binding sequence were implicated in autoinhibition (29Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1107-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar; 14Ito M. Guerriero Jr., V. Chen X. Hartshorne D.J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that basic residues even further amino-terminal to the originally proposed pseudosubstrate sequence and close to the carboxyl terminus of the catalytic core could be involved in maintaining myosin light chain kinase in an inhibited state (Fig. 1). In each case, both single charge reversal and alanine substitution mutations of residues Lys953, Lys961, Lys965, and Lys967 resulted in kinases that were more easily activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (decreased [Ca2+] and KCaM values relative to wild-type). The results with Lys953 are most interesting since this residue is close to the junction between the catalytic core and the connecting region. These findings support the hypothesis that an intrasteric, autoinhibitory mechanism for myosin light chain kinase involves structures that extend beyond the proposed pseudosubstrate sequence. They also support the idea that the connecting region between the catalytic core and calmodulin binding domain may be bound to the surface of the catalytic core similar to the binding of the carboxyl-terminal tail of twitchin kinase to its catalytic core (20Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The multiple intramolecular contacts made by this connecting region may be involved in autoinhibition and, because of the extensive contacts, single mutations would not be expected to produce profound effects on Ca2+/calmodulin activation properties. However, 29Shoemaker M.O. Lau W. Shattuck R.L. Kwiatkowski A.P. Matrisian P.E. Guerra-Santos L. Wilson E. Lukas T.J. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1107-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar showed that multiple charge reversal mutations in a portion of this autoinhibitory sequence could result in a constitutively active myosin light chain kinase.Many acidic residues in the catalytic core appear to have specific interactions with the autoinhibitory sequence, but not light chain. The conservative neutral mutation, E858Q, created a kinase with wild-type catalytic properties but a 7-fold lower KCaM value. This result is consistent with the suggestion that Glu858 is involved in maintenance of autoinhibition but not in binding to the regulatory light chain. As predicted, D898K, D913K, and D914K each displayed similar [Ca2+] and KCaM values as wild-type myosin light chain kinase, suggesting that these acidic residues do not bind to or near the autoinhibitory sequence. However, evidence was not obtained that other predicted acidic residues bind to the autoinhibitory sequence (Asp896, Glu900, and Asp911). Thus, the acidic residues on the surface of the catalytic core, which have been implicated from this and previous mutational analyses (6Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Trafny A. Sowadski J. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26578-26582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in binding to or near the autoinhibitory sequence, are predicted to be mainly in the D α-helix (Fig. 3). The placement of these residues defines a binding pathway distinct from that of PKI binding to the G α-helix of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By inference then, this pathway is also distinct from the purported substrate-binding groove that predicts pseudosubstrate as well as substrate binding contacts with residues in the G α-helix (Asp896, Glu900, and Asp911) (22Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; 20Kemp B.E. Parker M.W. Hu S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In fact, none of these acidic residues nor any of those in the vicinity of the G α-helix (Asp898, Asp913 and Asp914) can be implicated by our mutational analyses in binding to or near the autoinhibitory domain. Additional proposed contacts include Glu858, which is found in a loop spatially situated between the D α-helix and the G α-helix, and Glu777, which is found in the active site cleft on the D α-helix (22Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, Glu858 also does not appear to bind the light chain. These results suggest that the autoinhibitory sequence may bind on the surface that comprises the substrate binding pocket immediately surrounding the catalytic site, but it is likely to have more contacts with the D α-helix than with the G α-helix.Figure 3:Ribb"

The recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity from COS-7 cell media by sequential chromatography on columns of NiCl2-chelating Sepharose, Affi-Gel blue, and Sephacryl S-100. Kinetic parameters of recombinant and native polypeptide GalNAc transferase were comparable for the donor UDP-GalNAc and for the peptide acceptors AcTPPP, EPO-T (PPDAATAAPLR), and HVF (PHMAQVTVGPGL). Initial velocity and product inhibition studies were carried out with purified recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase and the substrates UDP-GalNAc and peptide EPO-T. Initial velocity data was consistent with a sequential type mechanism in which binding of both substrates precedes product release. Product inhibition analysis using UDP showed competitive inhibition against UDP-GalNAc and a noncompetitive inhibition against peptide EPO-T. The dead end peptide analogue EPO-G (PPDAAGAAPLR) was a noncompetitive inhibitor of UDP-GalNAc and a competitive inhibitor of peptide EPO-T. Collectively, the results suggest that the most probable kinetic mechanism for the enzyme is one in which both substrates must bind in a random order prior to catalysis.

The initial step in mucin type O-linked glycosylation is catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.41) (polypeptide GalNAc transferase)1 1The abbreviations used are: polypeptide GalNAc transferaseUDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferaseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: polypeptide GalNAc transferaseUDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferaseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and results in the covalent attachment of GalNAc to the hydroxyamino acids threonine and serine in an α-anomeric linkage. The two-substrate/two-product reaction utilizes the nucleotide sugar UDP-GalNAc and a polypeptide acceptor and produces free UDP and glycosylated protein in a yet undefined mechanism(1McGuire E.J. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3745-3747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polypeptide GalNAc transferase is the first enzyme in a series of glycosyltransferases leading to the stepwise assembly of protein-linked complex carbohydrate structures (2). As such, it represents a potentially important early control point in O-glycosylation, and it is therefore important to define its mechanism.

Previous characterization of the enzyme has demonstrated that the monomeric soluble enzyme requires the divalent cation manganese for its activity(3Sugiura M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9501-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Elhammer A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. Abernethy J.L. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The donor specificity is restricted to UDP-GalNAc (3, 5); in contrast, substrate specificity studies indicate that the enzyme binding site is large (8 or 9 residues) and can accommodate a wide range of amino acids that flank the glycosylation site(6Elhammer A.P.

However, the kinetics of the enzyme in terms of the mechanism and the order in which the two substrates bind have not yet been defined. Available evidence suggests that more than one polypeptide GalNAc transferase may exist and that these may exhibit overlapping specificities(5Wang Y. Abernethy J.L. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8O'Connell B. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol.

Therefore, in the present study, we have purified to apparent homogeneity a recombinant form of this enzyme. We have measured kinetic parameters of this enzyme; these are consistent with the polypeptide GalNAc transferase binding to its substrates in a random sequential order prior to catalysis. We further demonstrate that the presence of a hydroxyamino acid is not essential for the interaction of the polypeptide GalNAc transferase with peptide substrates. An insulin secretion signal sequence (gift of Dr. K. Drickamer) and the coding region of the bovine placental polypeptide GalNAc transferase were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pSVL (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described in Hagen et al.(9Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to engineer a metal binding site with the amino acid sequence HHWHHH (modified from Ref. 11) immediately downstream from the insulin processing site (Fig. 1A). The secreted recombinant enzyme encoded by plasmid pSVL-inGNT1 is thus designed with an in vivo cleavable processing site that produces the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence FVHMHHWHHH preceding the native soluble form of the polypeptide GalNAc transferase. Plasmid pSVL-inGNT1 was used to transfect COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were grown to 80-90% confluence (approximately 1 × 107 cells) at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum, 6% CO2 in 10 100-mm culture dishes. Cells were transfected with 8 μg DNA using a liposome-mediated transfection protocol (8 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.). At 72 h post-transfection, the media were harvested and replaced with conditioned Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At 96 h post-transfection, the media were harvested. Sterile buffers used in the enzyme purification were SBB (30 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.5), wash buffer A (50 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 5.7), wash buffer B (100 mM MES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, pH 4.7), binding buffer (30 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.1), buffer D (25 mM MES, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.001% Triton X-100 (hydrogenated form), pH 6.5), and buffer E, 25 mM MES, 80 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100 (hydrogenated form), pH 6.5. The harvested media were clarified of cellular debris by low speed centrifugation and diluted to SBB conditions (150 ml). The pool was applied to columns of NiCl2-chelating Sepharose (Pharmacia) equilibrated with SBB and fractionated as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Prior to analysis, aliquots from each purification step were buffer-exchanged for water using Micron 10 ultrafiltration devices (Amicon). The proteins were then hydrolyzed under standard conditions (vapor phase HCl, 106°C, 20 h), and the hydrolyzed material was analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard amino acid analyzer with Amino Quant II software. Aliquots of the pools from the recombinant transferase purification were subjected to 10%/3% Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(12Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). To detect proteins, samples were dried down and resuspended in 100 mM Hepes, 6 M urea, 20 mM NaCNBH3, and a 10-fold excess of [14C]formaldehyde to lysine in protein(13Tabak L.A. Mirels L. Monte L.D. Ridall A.L. Levine M.J. Loomis R.E. Lindauer F. Reddy M.S. Baum B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, the samples were ethanol-precipitated (80%) and resuspended in Tricine SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 12% glycerol (w/v), 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 2% mercaptoethanol (v/v), 0.01% Serva Blue G). Electrophoresis of 10% gels was performed at 15-20 mA and was followed by soaking of the gel in En3Hance (DuPont NEN). The gel was dried down, and radiolabeled protein was visualized by autoradiography on Kodak XAR film. To obtain NH2-terminal amino acid sequence data, 8 pmol of purified recombinant transferase from step 3 was exchanged into water using a Centricon-10 (Amicon) ultrafiltration device. The sample was applied to a Polybrene-coated trifluoroacetic acid-activated precycled glass fiber filter and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. The recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase was assayed for synthesis of GalNAc-substituted peptide in 25-50-μl reactions containing 40 mM sodium cacodylate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10-15 mM MnCl2, pH 6.5. The acceptor peptides EPO-T (PPDAATAAPLR), HVF (PHMAQVTVGPGL), and AcTPPP have been described previously (8O'Connell B. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25010-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used in a concentration range of 0.02-5 mM. The UDP-[14C]GalNAc (DuPont NEN) and UDP-GalNAc (Sigma) concentration range was 1-1600 μM. The UDP (Sigma) stock solution concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (extinction coefficient (260 nm) = 10 optical density units/mM). The purified recombinant transferase was diluted 1:20 in 50 mM cacodylate, 100 mM NaCl, 50% glycerol, pH 6.5 added to the reactions. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for a period of time such that less than 10% of the substrate UDP-[14C]GalNAc was consumed. At this point, the incubation was terminated by addition of 10 μl of 150 mM EDTA and passed through anion exchange spin columns (Dowex AG 1-X8, Bio-Rad), and the counts were determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. The kinetic experiments were performed at least twice. Data were plotted graphically to show the initial velocity and fitted to Equation 1, corresponding to the initial velocity of a two-substrate reaction(14Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). υ=VAB/(KiaKb+KaB+KbA+AB)(Eq. 1) where V is the maximum velocity, K is the Michaelis constant for the varied substrate, and A and B are the concentrations of A and B. Data were plotted graphically to show inhibition patterns and fitted to Equations 2–4 corresponding to competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively(14Cleland W.W.

Starting estimates of the parameters were obtained from linear regression, and fits were made using the NLIN procedure of SAS with the Gauss-Newton method(15SAS/STAT User's Guide, Version 6. Vol. 2. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC1989Google Scholar). The plasmid construct pSVL-inGNT1 contains an insulin secretion signal preceding a metal binding site and polypeptide GalNAc transferase coding sequence as defined in Fig. 1A. In vivo processing of the signal peptide in COS-7 cells directs secretion of the soluble form of the recombinant transferase with an NH2-terminal metal anchor (Fig. 1B) into the culture medium. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pSVL-inGNT1 expressed and secreted sufficient GalNAc transferase, such that 1 μl of culture medium incorporated 2,000-10,000 cpm/h of UDP-[14C]GalNAc into peptide substrates under standard assay conditions. Splitting cells 18 h post transfection resulted in a reduction in the concentration of expressed enzyme activity relative to unsplit cells. Growth at 100% confluence for 5 days was not detrimental to this transient expression system (Fig. 2). In an experiment to determine the duration of gene expression, maximal expression of the recombinant gene was achieved at 48 h post-transfection, whereas de novo recombinant enzyme synthesis was minimal by 96 h (data not shown), indicating that the plateau for enzyme activity observed in Fig. 2 was due to a decrease in gene expression and not to instability or degradation of the recombinant enzyme. Indeed, the soluble recombinant enzyme was stable at 37°C for at least 3 days, since a 37°C incubation of the clarified culture medium did not result in loss of recombinant enzyme activity (data not shown). A summary of the purification of this enzyme from approximately 108 COS-7 cells is given in. Metal chelate chromatography (step 1) was used to selectively remove the recombinant form of the transferase from the media supernatants by virtue of the affinity tag (HHWHHH) at the NH2 terminus of the enzyme (Fig. 3A). Chromatography on Affi-Gel blue (step 2) eliminated high molecular weight contaminants (Fig. 4, lane 3) and increased the specific activity of the material 7-fold (Fig. 3B). Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100 (step 3) (Fig. 3C) yielded a recombinant transferase fraction that migrated as a single band on Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, lane 4). The apparent molecular weight of the recombinant GalNAc transferase was 68,000 Da, a value consistent with that of the native bovine colostrum GalNAc transferase(9Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence of the recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase was determined by NH2-terminal protein sequencing (Fig. 1B). The presence of the processed insulin secretion signal and the metal binding sequence indicate that the protein was intact. To determine whether the addition of a metal binding domain and secretion by COS-7 cells into tissue culture medium had any effect on the properties of the enzyme, kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of the purified recombinant GalNAc transferase were compared with those of the purified native enzyme (Table II). The Km and Vmax for UDP-GalNAc were obtained with peptide AcTPPP at saturating conditions with both enzymes; the recombinant GalNAc transferase displayed an acceptor specificity similar to that of the native GalNAc transferase with regard to the Kmvalues for the nucleotide sugar and for peptides AcTPPP and HVF. Similarly, the Vmax values for both the nucleotide sugar and peptide AcTPPP were the same. These results indicated that the kinetic properties of the recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase were not affected by the presence of the metal binding domain at its NH2 terminus.Table II:Estimated kinetic constants for the recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase substrates Open table in a new tab Two-substrate enzyme reactions can proceed by one of three mechanisms: (a) ping-pong, (b) compulsory ordered sequential, or (c) random ordered sequential(17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). To identify the mechanism preferentially used by the polypeptide GalNAc transferase, experiments were performed in which the concentrations of peptide EPO-T and UDP-GalNAc were varied. Six concentrations of UDP-GalNAc ranging from 1 to 80 μM and six concentrations of peptide EPO-T ranging from 0.07 to 2 mM (0.2-8 Km for UDP-GalNAc and 0.2-5 Km for EPO-T) were used. Concentrations of peptide beyond 2 mM were avoided because problems of peptide solubility arise and because the velocity of the reaction begins to decrease at values slightly greater than 2 mM. The data were graphed in a double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 5) and produced a family of intersecting lines typical of a sequential mechanism. A plot of 1/v versus 1/[EPO-T] also produced a family of intersecting lines (data not shown). Data obtained were fit to the initial velocity equation (Equation 1), which can be modified to specifically describe each of the two-substrate enzyme reaction mechanisms outlined above. The ping-pong model is a special case of Equation 1 in which Kia = 0(14Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). When the Kia is 0, the slope expression of the double-reciprocal form of Equation 1 becomes insensitive to changes in the concentration of the second substrate in the reaction. On a double-reciprocal plot, this produces the typical parallel line pattern of the ping-pong mechanism. The estimate of Kia (Table III) was found to be more than 6.7 standard errors away from 0 (95% confidence interval (0.0111, 0.0207)) and is thus inconsistent with the ping-pong mechanism. The equilibrium-ordered mechanism is also a special case of Equation 1 in which Ka = 0(14Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). However, the estimate of Ka (Table I) was found to be more than 6.1 standard errors away from 0 (95% confidence interval (0.0067, 0.0133)), and this is inconsistent with the equilibrium-ordered sequential model.Table III:Estimated kinetic constants for the recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase Open table in a new tab Table I:Purification of recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase from COS-7 cell culture media Open table in a new tab To further distinguish between an ordered sequential and random mechanism, we first examined the inhibitory effect of UDP. UDP is a reaction product known to inhibit the reaction(3Sugiura M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9501-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6A shows that UDP was a competitive inhibitor of UDP-GalNAc. The slope effect, combined with the absence of an intercept effect, typical of competitive inhibition, was further emphasized by the replot (Fig. 6A, inset). Fig. 6B shows the effect of UDP with peptide EPO-T as the varied substrate. The replot (Fig. 6B, inset) shows both a slope and intercept effect consistent with UDP being a noncompetitive inhibitor of the peptide. To unambiguously distinguish between a random ordered and ordered sequential mechanism, a dead end peptide analogue in which the threonine residue of EPO-T was replaced with a glycine residue (EPO-G: PPDAAGAAPLR) was used in inhibitor studies. If UDP-GalNAc participates in an ordered sequential mechanism, a pattern of uncompetitive inhibition would be seen when the concentrations of UDP-GalNAc and EPO-T were varied and held constant, respectively. This would graphically translate as a family of parallel lines on a double-reciprocal plot. However, Fig. 7A shows that a series of parallel lines is not generated. The replot (Fig. 7A, inset) indicates that there was a slope effect as well as a slight intercept effect providing evidence against an ordered sequential mechanism. The statistical fit of the data was consistent with EPO-G being a noncompetitive inhibitor of UDP-GalNAc (Table III). At a fixed subsaturating concentration of UDP-GalNAc, only changes in slope consistent with competitive inhibition were observed with varying concentrations of EPO-G (Fig. 7B and inset). The absence of uncompetitive inhibition between the dead end analogue EPO-G and either of the substrates ruled out an ordered mechanism in which there is compulsory binding of one substrate before the other to form a ternary complex. Instead, the patterns of inhibition of the dead inhibitor EPO-G were consistent with a random sequential mechanism. We have transiently expressed a secreted recombinant form of a polypeptide GalNAc transferase indistinguishable from the native enzyme with respect to kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax). Since several lines of evidence have suggested that the polypeptide GalNAc transferase may be expressed in multiple forms with overlapping specificities, the characterization of a homogeneous form of the enzyme represents an initial step in determining if alternate forms of this enzyme exist. An insulin secretion signal was used to target the recombinant enzyme for secretion(19Hsueh E.C. Holland E.C. Carrera Jr., G.M. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby allowing us to distinguish the cloned activity from the endogenous activity of COS-7 cells. The metal binding affinity tag engineered in the amino terminus of the recombinant enzyme provided a facile method to remove over 98% of contaminant proteins from cell culture media by metal chelate chromatography. Approximately 5 μg of homogeneous recombinant polypeptide GalNAc transferase was prepared from the culture supernatants of 108 COS-7 cells. Our data suggest that the polypeptide GalNAc transferase reaction proceeds via a random ordered sequential mechanism (Fig. S1). This mechanism is consistent with the observation that bovine colostrum polypeptide GalNAc transferase can be purified on a 5-Hg-UDP-GalNAc affinity matrix in the absence of protein substrate (9). Further, the estimated kinetic constants Km and Ki for UDP-GalNAc (10 μM, 16 μM) and EPO-T (0.408 mM, 0.648 mM) were similar to one another (Table III); the similarity of the Km and Ki of a substrate is an indication that their binding to the enzyme occurs independently of one another(17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). To our knowledge, only one other nucleotide sugar:protein transferase has been described in terms of reaction mechanism. UDP-D-xylose:core protein β-D-xylosyltransferase catalyzes the first step in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan O-glycosylation. The reaction in which xylose, donated by the nucleotide sugar UDP-xylose, is added to serine has been determined to proceed via an ordered sequential mechanism(20Kearns A.E. Campbell S.C. Westley J. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7477-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It remains unclear why two enzymes that catalyze similar committed steps of O-glycosylation do so using different mechanisms. In this study, the Ki of UDP was 380 μM, as determined by slope and intercept effects (Table III). This value is one order of magnitude greater than the Ki of a polypeptide GalNAc transferase purified from an ascites hepatoma and published previously (26 μm; Ref. 3). The discrepancy might be because the two enzymes represent different proteins. The effect of UDP on the activity of the polypeptide GalNAc transferase described here was not as potent as for the polypeptide GlcNAc transferase catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc residues to hydroxyamino acids; more than 50% of the activity of this cytosolic enzyme could be abolished by as little as 0.5 μM UDP(21Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both nucleotide sugar:protein transferases glycosylate polypeptides via the transfer of a saccharide donated by a UDP-based nucleotide-sugar, the data here suggested that UDP may not be an important means of regulation of polypeptide GalNAc transferase activity. However, similar to the lack of effect of free GlcNAc on the activity of the polypeptide GlcNAc transferase(21Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of various concentrations of free GalNAc had no significant effect on the activity of the polypeptide GalNAc transferase (data not shown), suggesting a requirement by the enzyme for GalNAc to be attached to a uridine diphosphate. The data from the competitive inhibition between EPO-T and EPO-G provided insight into the mechanism of site selection of the enzyme. The similarity of the Km value for EPO-T (0.408 mM) and the Ki value for the dead end inhibitor EPO-G (0.770 mM) indicates that the enzyme binds to both peptides with similar affinity. Substrate selection may be a two-part process in which the enzyme can bind to a substrate that meets the flanking sequence requirements, followed by binding to the target itself, i.e. the hydroxyamino acid. We speculate that the competition observed in vitro between EPO-T and EPO-G can occur in vivo in that both hydroxyamino acid-bearing peptides and peptides devoid of hydroxyamino acids can bind to the enzyme but can also exchange with one another, thus creating a potential point of regulation. We are currently conducting studies, in vivo, to test this hypothesis. All assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We thank Dr. Eric Phizicky for thoughtful comments about this work, Brian VanWuyckhuyse for the amino acid analysis and NH2-terminal sequencing, Dr. Richard Raubertas for help with the statistical analysis, and Pat Noonan for preparing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2095207676,"A series of homologated 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 molecules with one to three extra carbons in the side chain were used to examine the substrate preferences and hydroxylation site selection mechanisms of the liver vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase (CYP27) and the target cell 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24). Cultured and transfected cell models, used as sources of these hydroxylases, gave 23-, 24-, 25-, and 27-hydroxylated metabolites which were identified by their high performance liquid chromatography and GC-MS characteristics. Lengthening the side chain is tolerated by each cytochrome P450 isoform such that 25-hydroxylation or 24-hydroxylation continues to occur at the same rate as in the native side chain, while the site of hydroxylation remains the same for the liver enzyme in that CYP27 continues to hydroxylate at C-25 and C-27 (minor) despite the two-carbon-atom extension. Somewhat surprising is the finding that C-24 and C-23 (minor) hydroxylations also do not change as the side chain is extended by as much as three carbons. We conclude that CYP24 must be directed to its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance of carbon 24 from the vitamin D ring structure and not as in CYP27 by the distance of the hydroxylation site from the end of the side chain.

In recent years there has been an explosion in the number of novel analogs of vitamin D3 chemically synthesized for the purpose of developing drugs for the treatment of metabolic bone disease, cancer, and psoriasis(1Jones G. Calverley M.J. Trends in Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 297-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In large part, this recent interest in vitamin D analogs arose from the finding that the hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3),1 1The abbreviations used are: D2 or D3vitamin D2 or vitamin D3OH or (OH)2hydroxy or dihydroxy, e.g. 1α,25-(OH)2D3 = 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (note that in the nomenclature used, no distinction between C-26 and C-27 is implied)BSAbovine serum albuminDPPDN,N′-diphenylethylenediamineHIMhexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanolRRTrelative retention time (compared to 1α-OH-D3)α-MEMα-minimal essential mediumHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. stimulates differentiation of certain cells in the skin and myeloid lineages as well as performing its classical roles in Ca2+ and PO43− homeostasis(2Suda T.

Despite the fact that many of these analogs have been screened for biological activity in a variety of assays (calcemic activity, differentiation activity, vitamin D receptor binding, vitamin D binding globulin binding), few have been subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis (3). Even fewer have been subjected to detailed metabolic studies. Exceptions include MC903 (calcipotriol) (4Sorensen H. Binderup L. Calverley M.J. Hoffmeyer L. Andersen N.R. Biochem.

Homologated vitamin D metabolites with a single extra carbon (C-24a) between carbons C-24 and C-25 or on the C-26 and/or C-27 were first synthesized by Ikekawa and co-workers and tested biologically by DeLuca and co-workers (8Ostrem V.K.

Res. 1990; 5: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was quickly recognized that these homologated analogs might offer potential as drugs because of increased biological activity in several in vitro assays. However, the exact molecular basis for this increased biological activity was never fully elucidated, and the metabolic fate of these homologated analogs never studied. The availability of a series of such homologated vitamin D analogs together with much biological data made them particularly attractive for metabolic study using a systematic approach. Furthermore, the recent clinical research interest in the use of more complex homologated vitamin Ds (e.g. EB1089 and KH1060, Leo Pharmaceutical Products) made the choice of metabolism of homologated vitamin D analogs a topical subject for investigation. The vitamin D hydroxylases constitute a family of mixed-function oxidases which contain as their specific component, a cytochrome P450 isoform. Two such cytochrome P450 isoforms have been cloned, one putatively representing the liver vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase (CYP27) and the other that of the kidney 25-OH-D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24)(12Usui E. Noshiro M. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Few experiments have been carried out using the expression of the cDNAs of these cytochrome P450s to determine their specificity, but other studies have shown that CYP27 has broad substrate specificity, hydroxylating bile acid intermediates and a range of vitamin D compounds(14Oftebro H. Saarem K. Bjorkhem I. Peterson J. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 1254-1264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Andersson S. Davis D. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our own laboratory has shown CYP27 to lack regiospecificity, placing hydroxyl groups into a number of carbon positions at C-24, C-25, and C-27 of the classical D3 and D2 side chains(16Guo Y.D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). No studies have been performed with the newer analogs to probe the structural requirements of these cytochrome P450 isoforms. Thus, in these studies, we set out to use the homologated series of analogs as tools in the study of the two best known hydroxylases, the liver vitamin D3-25-hydroxylase and the target cell 25-OH-D3-24-hydroxylase. We chose to study metabolism in vitro using cultured cell systems we have established for this purpose (17Strugnell S. Calverley M.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Masuda S. Strugnell S. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Kremer R. Jones G. J. Biol.

Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our findings show that the homologated vitamin D analogs are extremely valuable in that they reveal important information about how the two enzymes interact with their substrates. The human keratinocyte cell line, HPK1A (18Henderson J. Sebag M. Rhim J. Goltzman D. Kremer R.

Similarly, the development of the human liver cell line, HH01, by one of us (E. R.) has been described previously(20Roberts E.A. Xie Z.W. Yang S. Lipa J. Drug Metab Dispos. 1993; 21: 56-61PubMed Google Scholar). The SV-40 transformed African Green Monkey kidney cell line, COS-1, was purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection. All solvents used were of HPLC grade and were obtained from Caledon Laboratories (Georgetown, ON, Canada). The bovine adrenodoxin expression plasmid pBAdx-4 (21Okamura T. John M.E. Zuber M.X.

Waterman (University of Texas Medical School, Dallas, TX). The vitamin D analogs: 24a,24b-dihomo-1α-(OH)D3 (MC1281), 24a-homo-1α,25-(OH)2D3 (MC1127), 24a,24b-dihomo-1α,25-(OH)2D3 (MC1147), and 24a,24b,24c-trihomo-1α,25-(OH)2D3 (MC1179) (Fig. 1) were synthesized as described previously(22Bretting C.

Walter de Gruyter, New York1991: 159-160Crossref Google Scholar). Their 23- and 24-hydroxylated derivatives were synthesized by methods to be described elsewhere. The 23-hydroxylated compounds were available separately with known configuration, whereas the 24-hydroxylated compounds were available as 1:1 diastereoisomeric mixtures. The radioactive hormone, [1β-3H]1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ([3H]1,25-(OH)D3) was synthesized as described previously(23Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Metabolites were generated from HPK1A-ras cells as described previously(5Masuda S. Strugnell S. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J.

Near confluence, cells were treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 (10 nM) to induce transcription of catabolic enzymes. After 18 h, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% BSA and 100 μM DPPD (Sigma). Cells were then incubated for 48 h in the presence of vehicle (0.01% EtOH) or a 10 μM concentration of analog in vehicle. HH01 were maintained in α-MEM supplemented as described previously(20Roberts E.A. Xie Z.W. Yang S. Lipa J. Drug Metab Dispos. 1993; 21: 56-61PubMed Google Scholar). Near confluence, the medium was replaced with α-MEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 100 μM DPPD. Cells were incubated in the presence of vehicle (0.01% EtOH) or 25 μM MC1281 in vehicle for 20 h. COS-1 were transfected with the expression vectors pSG5-CYP27 and pBAdx (adrenodoxin) using the standard DEAE-Dextran method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1985: 16.41-16.44Google Scholar) as described previously(16Guo Y.D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's MEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 100 μM DPPD. Cells were then incubated for 30 h in the presence of vehicle (0.01% EtOH) or MC1281 (25 μM) in vehicle. Cells and medium were extracted as described previously(24Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HPLC separation of metabolites was achieved using a Zorbax-SIL (0.62 × 8 cm; 3 μ) column eluted with HIM 91:7:2 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Metabolites were identified based on their characteristic vitamin D3 chromophore (UVmax = 265, UVmin = 228, UVmax/UVmin = 1.75). Further steps of HPLC were performed on the crude peaks isolated from the first step of purification, using a Zorbax-CN (0.46 × 25 cm; 6 μ) column and 91:7:2 (HIM) solvent system at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Two rounds of HPLC yielded metabolites which were pure on the basis of the homogeneity of the collected peak. Co-chromatography of each purified biologically derived metabolite with its chemically synthesized counterpart was attempted using one of the two HPLC column systems described above. The inclusion of 1α-OH-D3 as an internal standard allowed us to convert retention times of metabolites into relative retention times, and mean relative retention times were calculated from triplicate HPLC runs. Mean relative retention times were considered identical if they were within two standard deviations of each other. Purified metabolites were subject to chemical modification using sodium metaperiodate or sodium borohydride as described previously(24Dilworth F.J. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Modified metabolites were subject to HPLC analysis using the system described above. Purified metabolites were derivatized to pertrimethylsilyl ethers, then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously(26Qaw F. Calverley M.J. Schroeder N.J. Trafford D.J.H. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 282-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Injection of metabolites of analogs described in this paper into the high temperature injection zone of the GC causes B ring closure producing pyro- and isopyro- isomers. Mass spectra were obtained only from the pyro- isomer, and, for simplicity, in discussion of fragmentation and in figures illustrating spectra obtained, the uncyclized metabolite structure is used rather than that of the correct pyro- isomer. Mass spectra were obtained by averaging each peak and subtracting the background. The rate of metabolism of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 analogs was measured as described previously(24Dilworth F.J.

HPK1A-ras cells were incubated with [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 (23 nM) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of analog (0 to 23 μM) for 3 h at 37°C. Triplicate 500-μl aliquots of aqueous fraction from the cell/medium extract were mixed with aqueous scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. The rate of metabolism of 1α-(OH)D3 and MC1281 were compared using a time course study. The cell line HH01 was grown in 6-well plates as described above. Near confluence, the medium was replaced with α-MEM supplemented with 1% BSA and 100 μM DPPD. Cells were incubated with 25 μM analog for 0, 6, 12, or 18 h, then extracted, and purified as described above. Both the amount of substrate remaining and metabolites produced were determined by integrating the area under peak of UV absorbance at 265 nm. Each data point is the average of three incubations. Incubation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 with HPK1A-ras cells resulted in the formation of the four lipid-soluble metabolites of the hormone (Fig. 2D). The four metabolites generated include 1,24,25(OH)3D3 (peak D), 24-oxo-1,25-(OH)2D3 (peak A), 24-oxo-1,23,25(OH)3D3 (peak C), and 24,25,26,27-tetranor-1,23(OH)2D3 (peak B) as determined by co-migration with standard compounds (data not shown). These metabolites correspond to the intermediates which have previously been reported to be a part of the C-24 oxidation pathway of vitamin D3(27Jones G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 123: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This confirms that the Ha-ras transformed cell line, HPK1A-ras, expresses functional enzymes involved in the side chain oxidation pathway for inactivation of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Analytical HPLC separation of lipid soluble HPK1A-ras cell extracts taken from cells incubated with homologated analogs (10 μM) indicated that we were able to generate three (or more) metabolites from MC1127 (Fig. 2A) and MC1147 (Fig. 2B), while only two metabolites were generated from MC1179 (Fig. 2C). Rechromatography of the peak labeled MC1147-MetC (see inset in Fig. 2B) indicated that this peak was a mixture of two metabolites which could be resolved on Zorbax-CN (termed peaks C and D). As we were able to generate only two metabolites from MC1179, a second incubation was performed in which the ratio of cultured cell density:concentration of substrate (MC1179) was increased in order to generate a greater amount of less abundant metabolites. In doing so, we were able to generate sufficient quantities of this third metabolite, termed MC1179-MetC (peak not apparent in the chromatogram shown in Fig. 2C), to be identified later by GC-MS. The chromatographic properties of the purified metabolites generated from all three analogs are summarized in Table I. The availability of reference standards of both R and S forms allowed the exclusion of the presence of other isomers in the extracts.Table I:Properties of metabolites generated from homologated analogs in HPK1A-ras cells Open table in a new tab The major metabolites were identified by GC-MS and direct comparison with chemically synthesized standards (see). All three putative 23-hydroxylated metabolites exhibited identical relative retention times on HPLC to one of the two 23(R)- or 23(S)- chemically synthesized epimeric forms. The metabolite, MC1127-MetC (RRT = 3.52 ± 0.02) co-migrated with 23(R)-OH-MC1127 (RRT = 3.56 ± 0.01) but not 23(S)-OH-MC1127 (RRT = 3.44 ± 0.01); the metabolite MC1147-MetC (RRT = 3.50 ± 0.02) co-migrated with 23(S)-OH-MC1147 (RRT = 3.59 ± 0.04) but not 23(R)-OH-MC1147 (RRT = 3.75 ± 0.03); the metabolite MC1179-MetC (RRT = 4.41 ± 0.02) co-migrated with 23(R)-OH-MC1179 (RRT = 4.43 ± 0.03) but not 23(S)-OH-MC1179 (RRT = 4.23 ± 0.06) (see for column and solvent systems used). Since the synthetic reference 24-hydroxylated standards ran as single peaks on HPLC and GC, identification of R/S isomers was not possible. However, relative retention times on HPLC of MC1127-MetA, MC1147-MetD, and MC1179-MetB were similar to those of the diastereoisomeric mixtures of their respective 24-hydroxylated standards. These were as follows: MC1127-MetA (RRT = 2.97 ± 0.01 min) compared with 24-OH-MC1127 (RRT = 2.99 ± 0.01); MC1147-MetD (RRT = 3.22 ± 0.02) compared with 24-OH-MC1147 (RRT = 3.21 ± 0.06); MC1179-MetB (RRT = 3.59 ± 0.04) compared with 24-OH-MC1179 (RRT = 3.65 ± 0.02) (see for column and solvent systems used). The identity of the 23-hydroxylated metabolites MC1127-MetC, MC1147-MetC, and MC1179-MetC were confirmed by comparing the mass spectra of pertrimethylsilylated ether derivatives of the putative metabolites with those of chemically synthesized standards (Fig. 3). In each case, the mass spectrum obtained from the biologically generated metabolite is very similar to that of its chemically synthesized standard (essentially no differences between R/S versions were observed). Molecular ions of m/z 734, 748, and 762 were observed for the pertrimethylsilylated ether derivatives of MC1127-MetC, MC1147-MetC, and MC1179-MetC, respectively, as expected for hydroxylation of the starting compounds. Ions of m/z 171, 185, and 199 result from the loss of a single silanol group from side chain fragments m/z 261, 275, and 289 for MC1127-MetC, MC1147-MetC, and MC1179-MetC, respectively, which arise from cleavage of the C-22-C-23 bond and suggest C-22-C-23 fragility. The mass spectra of all three 23-hydroxylated metabolites contained ions at m/z 395 and 305 due to the sequential loss of two and three silanol groups from the predicted ion m/z 575 (M - 159, M - 173, or M - 187, respectively) common to all 23-hydroxylated metabolites. This fragmentation pattern again suggests C-23-C-24 fragility. As with MC1147-MetB, an ion of m/z 278 was observed in all three spectra. This ion probably arises from a cleavage of the bond between C-22 and C-23 resulting in the loss of 261, 275, or 289 mass units from the molecular ion of each 23-hydroxylated metabolite, respectively. The resultant fragment of m/z 473 loses a methyl group and 2 silanols to give rise to the fragment at m/z 278. These results further confirm the identity of MC1127-MetC, MC1147-MetC, and MC1179-MetC as 23(R)-OH-MC1127, 23(S)-OH-MC1147, and 23(R)-OH-MC1179, respectively. To confirm the identities of MC1127-MetA, MC1147-MetD, and MC1179-MetB as the 24-hydroxylated metabolites, the mass spectra of pertrimethylsilylated ether derivatives of the purified metabolites were again compared to those of the chemically synthesized standards (Fig. 4). The mass spectra of the pertrimethylsilylated ether derivatives of the putative 24-hydroxylated metabolites are very similar to those of their corresponding chemically synthesized standards. In each case, molecular ions at m/z 734, 748, and 762 for the derivatives of MC1127-MetA, MC1147-MetD, and MC1179-MetB are consistent with the hydroxylation of the substrate. Ions of m/z 157, 171, and 185 due to the loss of a single silanol from side chain fragments of m/z 247, 261, and 275 are observed for MC1127-MetA, MC1147-MetD, and MC1179-MetB, respectively, and indicate C-23-C-24 bond fragility. The mass spectra of all three 24-hydroxylated metabolites contained ions of m/z 499 and 409 due to the sequential loss of one and two silanol groups, respectively, from the predicted m/z 589 (M - 145, M - 159, or M - 173) fragment common to all 24-hydroxylated metabolites. This fragmentation pattern suggests C-24-C-24a bond fragility. Also observed in the mass spectra of all three 24-hydroxylated metabolites was an ion at m/z 292, which is probably generated by cleavage of the bond between C-23 and C-24 resulting in the loss of 247, 261, or 275 mass units from the molecular ion of each 24-hydroxylated metabolite, respectively. The resultant fragment of m/z 487 loses a methyl group and 2 silanols to give the fragment at m/z 292. We conclude on the basis of these results that MC1127-MetA, MC1147-MetD, and MC1179-MetB are the 24-hydroxylated metabolites of their respective analogs. The minor metabolites illustrated in Fig. 2 and listed in, MC1127-MetB, MC1147-MetB, and MC1179-MetA were all found to be sodium borohydride-sensitive, and their mass spectral and chromatographic properties (see) are consistent with the presence of oxo-groups at C-23 or C-24. One other metabolite, MC1147-MetA, was studied but not conclusively identified on the basis of the information gathered (see). The effect of lengthening the vitamin D3 side chain on the rate of 24-hydroxylation was also examined using HPK1A-ras cells (Fig. 5). Measuring the ability of the analogs to compete with [1β-3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 for the enzymes of the side chain oxidation pathway, we observe that extending the vitamin D3 side chain does not significantly alter the rate of 24-hydroxylation. Northern analysis of HH01 cells using a CYP27 cDNA probe (16Guo Y.D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) indicated that CYP27 mRNA was expressed in this cell line (data not shown). Incubation of HH01 cells with either 1α-OH-D3 or MC1281 in each case resulted in the generation of two metabolites (Fig. 6, A and B). Other studies have shown that the vitamin D metabolites formed by HH01 cells are generated by cytochrome P450-dependent steps as judged by their sensitivity to heat inactivation and their total inhibition by the anti-fungal agent ketoconazole (used at a concentration of 5 μM).3 3F. J. Dilworth and G. Jones, unpublished observations. The two products of 1α-OH-D3 (MetA and MetB) have been previously identified as 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 1,26(27)-(OH)2D3, respectively(16Guo Y.D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In the case of MC1281, the less polar of the two metabolites (MC1281-MetA) co-migrated with the synthetic standard 24a,24b-dihomo-1,25-(OH)2D3 (MC1147) on two separate HPLC systems (Table II).Table II:Chromatographic properties of metabolites generated from MC1281 Open table in a new tab The metabolites generated in HH01 cells were further characterized by GC-MS analysis. The mass spectra of the pertrimethylsilylated ether derivatives of MC1281-MetA and the chemically synthesized standard 24a,24b-dihomo-1,25-(OH)2D3 (MC1147) are shown in Fig. 7. Both spectra show a molecular ion at m/z 660 and a major fragment at m/z 131 corresponding to [(CH3)2C=OTMS]+ produced by cleavage of the bond between C-24 and C-25. Such a fragment at m/z 131 is characteristic of most 25-hydroxylated vitamin D derivatives (e.g. 25-OH-D3). This evidence confirms the identify of MC1281-MetA as the 25-hydroxylated derivative. The mass spectrum of the pertrimethylsilylated ether derivative of MC1281-MetB also showed a molecular ion of m/z 660, again suggesting hydroxylation of MC1281. However, the appearance of a fragment at m/z 103 and none at m/z 131 indicates that hydroxylation has occurred at a different site, probably C-27 in this case, the fragment at m/z 103 representing [C(27)-OTMS]+ and being derived from C-25-C-27 cleavage. Thus the data are consistent with the minor metabolite, MC1281-MetB being the 27-OH derivative. The rate of metabolism of the side-chain-lengthened analog was compared to that of 1α-OH-D3 in HH01 cells. Measuring either the generation of metabolites (Fig. 8) or the disappearance of substrate (Fig. 8, inset), we observe that the rate of metabolism of MC1281 is not significantly different from that of 1α-OH-D3. To confirm that the two metabolites generated from MC1281 in HH01 cells were oxidation products mediated by the cytochrome P450 CYP27, MC1281 was incubated with COS-1 cells transfected with the cDNAs encoding CYP27 and adrenodoxin. Incubation of MC1281 with the transfected COS-1 cells resulted in the generation of two metabolite peaks that were absent in control transfected COS-1 cells. On HPLC, the two putative CYP27-generated products possessed similar retention times to metabolites MC1281-MetA and MC1281-MetB generated in HH01 cells (data not shown). In this paper we have used two in vitro cultured cell models to compare and contrast the substrate preferences of the cytochromes P450 responsible for 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 in the liver and the 23- and 24-hydroxylation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vitamin D target cells. Specifically, we have shown that lengthening the side chain of the vitamin D molecule is tolerated quite well in that each enzyme is able to continue to hydroxylate efficiently. However, most interestingly, our results reveal that the two cytochromes P450 must recognize their respective sites of hydroxylation by different mechanisms: the 25-hydroxylase appears to be directed to its terminal hydroxylation site by the distance from the end of side chain, whereas the 23- and 24-hydroxylases appear to be positioned at their hydroxylation site by the distance from the vitamin D nucleus. As a result and in accord with the recent studies of the liver side-chain hydroxylation of a variety of vitamin D compounds with the conventional D2 and D3 side chains(16Guo Y.D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), 25- and 27-hydroxylation of 24a,24b-dihomo-1α-OH-D3 can be demonstrated to occur in the HH01 cell line. However, using the target cell side-chain hydroxylation system (HPKIA-ras), we continued to observe 23- and 24-hydroxylation of 24a-homo, 24a,24b-dihomo, and 24a,24b,24c"
https://openalex.org/W2080259782,"In recent years, a large number of proteins having covalently linked myristic and palmitic acids have been discovered. It is assumed that fatty acid acylation serves to anchor proteins to membranes. However, it is not clear whether fatty acids modulate orientation of peptide chain in membranes or help in associating hydrophilic segments of peptides with membranes. We have examined the aggregation properties and membrane association of peptides corresponding to myristoylation and palmitoylation regions of proteins by fluorescence spectroscopy. Both acylated and non-acylated peptides were used for investigation. Binding of the peptides to lipid vesicles was assessed by monitoring the fluorescence of tryptophan as well as the quenching of its fluorescence in the presence of quenchers like I¯ and acrylamide. Our results indicate that in the peptide corresponding to a transmembrane segment, palmitoylation results in a change in the orientation of the peptide chain in the lipid bilayer. In the case of peptides that do not have a hydrophobic segment, acylation with palmitic or myristic acid does not appear to result in increased binding to lipid bilayer. Our results suggest that (i) the primary role of myristoylation may not be an anchor for membrane attachment as assumed, (ii) palmitoylation in the case of proteins having transmembrane segments may serve to realign the transmembrane segment from the normal orientation perpendicular to the bilayer surface, (iii) in the case of proteins where there is no hydrophobic segment, palmitoylation may not serve as a membrane anchor and could be involved in interaction with other membrane-bound proteins.

A large number of proteins undergo chemically diverse modifications during or after their translation (44Wold F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 783-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). These modifications have an effect on their structures and functions (Wold, 1981). One modification that has attracted considerable attention over the years is acylation with myristic and palmitic acids (34Schultz A.M. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar; 32Schmidt M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 411-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and isoprene units (35Sinensky M. Lutz R.J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). There has been extensive documentation of proteins that are acylated and the amino acid sequences in the region of acylation (Schultz et al., 1988; Schmidt, 1989). Mutagenesis studies have shown that attachment of fatty acid to protein is important for function of the proteins (18Kamps M.P. Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4625-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar; 43Willumsen B.M. Christensen A. Hubber N.L. Papageorge A.G. Lowry D.R. Nature. 1984; 310: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Enzymes that are responsible for attachment of fatty acids to proteins have been identified (Berger and Schmidt, 1987; 38Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson- Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; 11Glover C.J. Goddard C. Felsted R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It appears that myristoylation is cotranslational (42Wilcox C.A. Hu J.S. Olson E.N. Science. 1987; 238: 1275-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and palmitoylation is posttranslational (Schultz et al., 1988). A large number of fatty acylated proteins are either growth factor receptors (16James G. Olson E.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2623-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or participate in signal transduction (James and Olson, 1990) and are located at the vicinity of membranes. Hence, it has been postulated that fatty acid acylation serves to anchor proteins to membranes. However, there is practically no experimental evidence indicating whether fatty acids modulate orientation of peptide chains in membranes or help in associating hydrophilic segments of peptides with membranes. Hence, it would be pertinent to study the interaction between lipids and peptides corresponding to acylation sites in proteins. An understanding of the biophysical nature of the interactions of fatty acylated peptides with model membranes will help in understanding the molecular properties involved in the association of fatty acylated peptides with membranes in cells. In the present study, we have examined the aggregation properties and membrane association of peptides corresponding to myristoylation and palmitoylation regions of proteins (Table I). Both acylated and non-acylated peptides were used for investigations. The peptides chosen correspond to acylated regions that are hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic in nature. All the peptides have a tryptophan residue. Hence, peptide association and lipid-peptide interactions were assayed by steady state fluorescence measurements of tryptophan. Changes in fluorescence emission intensity and in the wavelength of emission maximum that occur when tryptophan enters an environment with a smaller dielectric constant (6Creed D. Photochem. Photobiol. 1984; 39: 537-562Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar) served as an indication of peptide aggregation or association with lipid. In addition to these measurements, quenching experiments in which the exposure of the peptides to aqueous quenchers like I¯ (20Lehrer S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar) and membrane-penetrating quenchers like acrylamide (10Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1976; 80: 486-493Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar) were determined. The combined approach of applying intrinsic fluorescence and quenching measurements provided data that indicate how the peptides aggregate and associate with model membranes. Based on the results, the possible role of fatty acid acylation in proteins has been discussed.Table I:Primary structures of peptides corresponding to fatty acylation sites in proteins and their fatty acyl derivatives Open table in a new tab Amino acids, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, fatty acids, and ethane dithiol were purchased from Sigma; solvents were from Merck India; trifluoroacetic acid, thioanisole, and m-cresol were from Fluka. All Fmoc 1The abbreviations used are: FmocN-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylPCphosphatidylcholineCFCarboxyfluorescein. 1-protected amino acids were from Nova Biochem. N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl phosphatidylcholine Carboxyfluorescein. All peptides were synthesized by solid phase procedures. Peptide 31R (Table I) was synthesized using 2% hexane dioldiacrylate-cross-linked polystyrene resin (anchoring capacity of 2.32 meq/g of resin) by procedures described earlier (26Renil M. Nagaraj R. Pillai V.N.R. Tetrahedron. 1994; 50: 6681-6688Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Synthesis of peptides 12R, 11R, and 14R (Table I) were performed on a Pharmacia semi-automated synthesizer by Fmoc chemistry (1Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 75-105Google Scholar) using NovaSyn KA resin from Novabiochem. The procedure for acylation of cysteine with palmitoyl chloride and of the N-terminal glycine with myristoyl chloride, when attached to the resin after removal of the acetamido methyl group was achieved as described previously (17Joseph M. Nagaraj R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1025-1028Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This was followed by acidolytic cleavage of the peptide from the resin to generate the fatty acylated peptides 31Pal, 12Pal, 11Myr, and 14Myr. The peptides were purified by fast performance liquid chromatography on a reverse phase PepRPC 5/5 (Pharmacia) column, except peptides 31R and 31Pal. Peptides 31R and 31Pal were purified by thorough washing with MeOH and acetonitrile as the impurities dissolved in small volumes of these solvents. The purity of the peptides were determined by amino acid analyses on a LKB 4151 Apha Plus Amino Acid Analyzer, after hydrolysis in vacuo with trifluoroacetic acid, 6 N HCl (1:2). The presence of fatty acids was confirmed by analysis on a Hewlett Packard 5840A gas-liquid chromatograph, after hydrolysis. The purity of non-acylated peptides was further confirmed by sequencing on a model 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Peptide stock solutions were made in methanol and/or Me2SO, and the concentrations were estimated by quantitative amino acid analysis. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by sonication of aqueous suspension of purified egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) in an ice bath with a 0.5-cm flat disrupter tip mounted on a Branson sonifier (cell disruptor B30 manufactured by the Branson Sonic Power Co.) and with a power setting at 2. After sonication, the vesicle suspension was centrifuged to remove titanium particles. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed with a Hitachi F4010 spectrofluorometer, using 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvettes. Excitation and emission bandpass was set at 3 nm each. The binding of peptides to lipid vesicles was assessed by monitoring the changes in the tryptophan spectra of the peptides on addition of small unilamellar vesicles of egg PC. Small aliquots of vesicle suspension were added to a solution of 3 μM peptide in buffer (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). The suspension was continuously stirred; after each addition of lipid, it was left to equilibrate for 20 min before the fluorescence spectra were recorded. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for contribution of light scattering caused by the lipid vesicles. The peptides were taken in 1 ml of buffer (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). The excitation wavelength used was 295 nm for acrylamide quenching and 280 nm for iodide quenching, respectively. The excitation and emission bandpass were set at 5 nm each, and the emission was checked at 340 nm. Increasing aliquots of an 3 M solution of acrylamide were added to the continuously stirred peptide solution and to the lipid vesicles containing peptide. (The peptide concentration was 3 μM, and lipid concentration was 150 μM). Fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution effects. Aliquots of KI were added from a 4 M stock solution of KI containing 1 mM of Na2S2O3 in order to prevent formation of I2 and I3¯, to the peptide and peptide-lipid solutions. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 340 nm, and the values were corrected for dilution effects. The quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation. The fluorescence measurements were done on a Hitachi F4010 spectrofluorometer using a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette. All measurements were done three times, and the average value was taken for analysis. The ability of peptides to cause perturbation of lipid vesicles was monitored by noting the increase in fluorescence intensity of carboxyfluorescein (41Weinstein J.N. Yoshikami P. Henkart P. Blumenthal R. Hagins W.A. Science. 1977; 195: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar; 3Blumenthal R. Weinstein J.N. Sharrow S.O. Henkart P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) encapsulated in PC at high self-quench concentrations, on addition of peptides The initial value was taken as zero, and after the addition of peptide to the lipid vesicles the release of CF was monitored continuously as a function of time and as a function of peptide concentration. The fluorescence intensity obtained on addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken as 100%. No discernible CF release was obtained with vesicles alone during the time course of the experiment. Polarization measurements were done with peptides in buffer and in lipid vesicles (peptide concentration was 3 μM and lipid concentration was 150 μM) using a Hitachi polarization accessory. Polarization values were calculated from the formula shown in Equation 1, where IVV and IVH are the measured fluorescence intensities with the excitation polarizer vertically oriented and the emission polarizer vertically and horizontally oriented, respectively. G is the correction factor and is equal to IHH/IHV (4Chen R.F. Bowman R.L. Science. 1965; 147: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). P=(Ivv−GIVH/Ivv+GIVH)(Eq. 1) Since the peptides listed in are hydrophobic either due to the peptide sequence or attached fatty acid, they could aggregate in aqueous medium. Hence this aspect was examined first by monitoring the λmax of Trp. The λmax of Trp is sensitive to solvent polarity (19Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.

Emission maximum of ~350 nm is indicative of Trp exposure to aqueous environment, whereas values of ~340 and 330 nm indicate moderate exposure to and shielding from aqueous environment respectively. The emission spectra of the peptides 12R and 31R and their palmitoylated derivatives are shown in Fig. 1. The emission maximum is ~350 nm for 12R and 12Pal, ~330 nm for 31R, and ~345 nm for 31Pal. The position of the emission maximum indicates that the tryptophan residue is exposed to aqueous environment in 12R and 12Pal. The emission maximum of 31R indicates that the tryptophan residue is shielded from aqueous environment. However, in 31Pal, the position of the emission maximum (~345 nm) indicates that the tryptophan is moderately exposed to the aqueous environment. The emission spectra of 11R, 14R, and their myristoylated derivatives are presented in Fig. 2. The emission maxima (~350 nm) indicate that the tryptophan is completely exposed in 11R as well as in 11Myr, whereas it is moderately shielded from the aqueous environment in 14R and 14Myr (λmax~ 340 nm).Figure 2:Fluorescence emission spectra of peptides in buffer (5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). a, 11R (–) and 11Myr (- - -); b, 14R (–) and 14Myr (- - -).

For all the peptides except 14R and 14Myr a linear increase in fluorescence intensity is observed. In addition, there is no shift in the position of emission maximum or hysteresis, which are indicative of peptide aggregation (Mathew et al., 1980). Thus, the peptides 12R, 12Pal, 11R, and 11Myr do not aggregate in the range of 1-6 μM. A slight non-linearity in the appearance of the curves was observed in the case of 31R, 31Pal, 14R, and 14Myr, suggesting a tendency to aggregate in buffer. It is also conceivable that 31R and 14R are already aggregated at a concentration of ~1 μM. Since denaturants like guanidine hydrochloride and urea (9De Young L.R. Fink A.L. Dill K.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 614-620Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and solvents like methanol could conceivably influence the aggregation properties of these peptides, the emission spectra of 31R, 14R, and their acylated derivatives were examined in these media. The spectra of these peptides in urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and MeOH are shown in Fig. 3. In 31R, the emission maximum does not shift in the presence of denaturants but there is an increase in quantum yield. This suggests that even in an unfolded state the tryptophan residue is not exposed to aqueous environment. However, a red shift in emission maximum and increase in quantum yield indicates “unfolding” of the peptide, resulting in exposure of Trp to aqueous environment. In 31Pal, there is very little shift in emission maximum or change in quantum yield. In 14R, although there is an increase in quantum yield, there is no shift in the position of emission maximum and 14Myr peptide does not exhibit any spectral change. It thus appears that in the hydrophobic peptides, the tryptophan residue seems to be solvent-shielded even under conditions where these peptides would be unfolded and disaggregated. The emission maxima and relative intensities of fluorescence of these peptides in different environments are summarized in Table II. These correspond to an average value of three independent sets of experiments. The variation in values was ~4%.Table II:The emission maximum (λmax) and relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of the peptides 31R, 31Pal, 14R, and 14Myr in urea, guanidine hydrochloride, and MeOH when excited at 280 nm Open table in a new tab The spectra of the peptides in the presence of small unilamellar vesicles of egg PC are shown in Fig. 4. In the case of hydrophilic peptides and their acyl derivatives, there is a decrease in quantum yield in the presence of lipid vesicles. The hydrophobic peptide 31R does not show much decrease in fluorescence intensity on association with lipid vesicles but in the palmitoylated derivative 31Pal, there is considerable decrease in quantum yield. In the case of 14R, a 14-residue leucine-rich peptide, there is an increase in quantum yield, but in the myristoylated derivative of 14R, the increase in relative fluorescence intensity is almost double that of 14R. In order to ascertain that the peptides did indeed bind to lipid vesicles, the fluorescence behavior of the peptides at a fixed concentration as a function of lipid concentration was determined. The results are presented in Fig. 5. A continuous decrease in fluorescence is observed for 12R, 11R, and their acyl derivatives. While there seems to be leveling of fluorescence in the case of 12R and 12Pal peptides, it is not apparent with 11R and 11Myr peptides. 31R shows very little change in fluorescence with increasing concentration of lipid vesicles, whereas 31Pal shows a sharp decrease, which levels off at a lipid:peptide ratio of 50:1. In the case of 14R and 14Myr peptides, there is an initial increase in fluorescence intensity, which decreases with increasing concentrations of lipid. The data shown in Fig. 5 suggest that 12R, 11R, and their acyl derivatives bind to lipid vesicles although not very strongly. It is unlikely that 31R does not bind to lipid vesicles. Since the emission maximum of ~335 nm indicates a hydrophobic environment, there may be no further change in the environment of tryptophan on binding to lipid vesicles. The acylated peptide 31Pal clearly binds to lipid vesicles.Figure 5:Fluorescence value of the peptides at emission maximum as a function of lipid concentration in aqueous buffer. Peptide concentration was kept at 3 μM. Excitation wavelength was at 280 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is unlikely that the decrease in quantum yield is due to impurities present in lipid vesicles, as similar results were obtained with dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. Additionally, peptides SPF and SPLN, the fluorescence behavior of which has been well established (36Sitaram N. Nagaraj R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3124-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), showed an increase in quantum yield in lipid preparations used in the present study, indicating that the quenching observed is a real observation. Fluorescence quenching experiments were undertaken to map the accessibility of the tryptophan residues to soluble and membrane resident quenchers. The quenching data by iodide analyzed by Stern-Volmer plots are shown in Fig. 6. The Stern-Volmer quenching constants are very similar for 12R, 11R, and their acyl derivatives in the presence and absence of lipid vesicles indicating that the accessibility of Trp to I¯ in the two situations is quite similar. It thus appears that the Trp in these peptides is not located in the hydrophobic core but is exposed to aqueous environment. In the case of 31R, the Trp is not accessible either in buffer or in lipid vesicles, whereas in the palmitoylated peptide, the Trp is not accessible in lipid vesicles and accessible in buffer. The quenching behavior of Trp in 14R is very similar to that of 31R. The iodide quenching data clearly indicate that 14Myr and 31Pal associate with lipid vesicles. The evidence for 11Myr and 12Pal association with lipid vesicles is less compelling. The quenching data analysis by Stern-Volmer plot in presence of acrylamide is shown in Fig. 7. The data support the conclusion drawn on the basis of KI quenching experiments. Interestingly, the efficient quenching observed in 31R reiterates the very hydrophobic environment in which the Trp is situated.Figure 7:Stern-Volmer plots for quenching Trp fluorophore of peptides in buffer and lipid vesicles by acrylamide. a, 12R in buffer (Δ) and lipids (-·-·-), 12Pal in buffer (○) and lipids (·). b, 11R in buffer (Δ) and lipids (-·-·-), 11Myr in buffer (○) and lipids (·). c, 31R in buffer (Δ) and lipids (-·-·-), 31Pal in buffer (○) and lipids (·). d, 14R in buffer (Δ) and lipids (-·-·-), 14Myr in buffer (○) and lipids (·).

In the presence of lipid vesicles, there is an increase in polarization for all the peptides. The polarization values indicate a greater degree of immobilization in the case of acylated hydrophobic peptides. The similar polarization values observed in the hydrophilic peptides suggest that acylation does not lead to immobilization of Trp in lipid vesicles. The environment and flexibility of tryptophan appears to be very similar in the acylated and nonacylated hydrophilic peptides.Table III:Fluorescence polarization values of peptides in buffer and lipid vesicles Open table in a new tab In order to examine whether association of the peptides with lipid vesicles results in perturbation of the bilayer structure, the release of CF from lipid vesicles entrapped at self-quench concentrations was monitored. The data presented in Fig. 8 indicate that the association of the peptide 14R and its acyl derivative with PC vesicles results in CF efflux, indicating the perturbation of the bilayer. The myristoyl derivative 14Myr clearly permeabilizes the vesicles to a greater extent than the peptide without the fatty acid. The palmitoylation site in proteins having transmembrane-spanning segments is in the vicinity of a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids (13Grand R.J.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In other proteins like Ras, the palmitoylation site is not in the vicinity of a hydrophobic stretch (15Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The myristoylation site is at the N terminus of proteins and is generally not in a hydrophobic region (Schultz et al., 1988). The peptides (listed in) used in this study correspond to the palmitoyl and myristoyl regions of proteins. Two of the peptides are hydrophobic, and the other two are hydrophilic in nature. Hydrophobic peptides tend to aggregate in aqueous medium, and aggregates of peptides may not associate with lipid vesicles effectively (31Saberwal G. Nagaraj R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hence, it would be important to determine the aggregation status of peptides before their interaction with lipid vesicles is investigated. The emission maximum of the peptides at ~335 nm in 31R and 14R indicates that the Trp in both peptides is shielded from aqueous environment. This shielding can occur as a result of peptide aggregation. The Trp in 31R is the N-terminal amino acid and would not be solvent-shielded if the peptide is entirely helical and in the monomeric form. However, in many short helical peptides the N- and C-terminal ends, especially ~5-6 amino acids from either end, are flexible, as suggested by two-dimensional NOE experiments (40Tappin M.J. Pastore A. Norton R.S. Freer J.H. Campbell I.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; 45Zagorski M.G. Norman D.G. Barrow C.J. Iwashita T. Tachibana K. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8009-8017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover, in 31R the amino acids at the N terminus are not those which initiate helical structures like in model peptides (33Scholtz M.J. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Hence, the probable conformation of 31R is a helical stretch in the hydrophobic region with a flexible N terminus. In such a conformation, the N-terminal region can loop back such that the Trp residue is proximal to the hydrophobic core. Peptide 14R has high helical content, and the molecules can aggregate in such a way that the Trp would be solvent-shielded. In 31Pal, the Trp is exposed to aqueous environment unlike in 31R. Palmitoylation thus appears to prevent aggregation. Since the fatty acid is at the N-terminal end in the peptide 14Myr, its effect is less pronounced on the aggregation properties of the peptide. The hydrophilic peptides do not aggregate, and acylation does not induce aggregation. Palmitoylation is a posttranslational event (Schmidt, 1989). In the case of proteins with hydrophobic transmembrane stretches, palmitoylation could conceivably have a role in preventing aggregation as suggested by the observation on 31Pal. The emission characteristics of Trp residue indicate that the hydrophilic peptides 12R, 11R, and their acylated derivatives indicate weak affinity for lipid vesicles. The emission maximum at ~350 nm indicates that the Trp in these peptides and their acyl derivatives are not located in the hydrophobic core of the lipid vesicles but near the polar head group region. The quenching of fluorescence in lipid environment as compared to aqueous medium could arise due to the differences in polarity on the surface of the bilayer as compared to bulk aqueous phase (37Surewicz W.K. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6072-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar; 7De Kroon A.I.P.M. Soekarjo M.W. De Gier J. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8229-8240Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the Trp fluorophore would be accessible to quenchers like I¯ as in bulk solvent, which is reflected in the Stern-Volmer quenching constants. It is unlikely that binding of 11R, 12R and their acylated derivatives are not registered by Trp by virtue of its location near a charged amino acid. In signal sequences (23McKnight C.J. Rafalski M. Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6241-6246Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), melittin (8Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and magainin analogs (22Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Tokada H. Funakoshi S. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), binding to lipid vesicles has resulted in changes in Trp fluorescence even though the position of Trp is adjacent to a charged amino acid. In the case of hydrophilic peptides, it is clear that acylation does not increase affinity to membranes or has influence in orienting the peptide chain in the lipid bilayer. In the case of hydrophobic peptides 31R and 14R, the membrane association is apparent with the acylated peptides as indicated by binding isotherms as well as quenching experiments with KI and acrylamide. The polarization values indicate that 31R and 14R also associate with lipid vesicles. The emission maximum at ~335 nm suggests that the Trp is located away from the head group of the membrane bilayer. The absence of large changes in fluorescence indicates that the environment around Trp in peptide aggregates and in lipid vesicles are similar. The Stern-Volmer plots suggest that in lipid vesicles, Trp in 14R is less accessible to aqueous quenchers than in 14Myr, indicating a more buried Trp residue. The greater polarization value of Trp in 31Pal as compared to 31R in lipid vesicles suggests a different orientation for the two peptides in lipid vesicles. In fact, the Stern-Volmer plots for 31Pal and 31R in lipid vesicles are also different, suggesting a different environment. The leveling of quenching clearly discernible in 31Pal in presence of lipid vesicles is absent in 31R. Although our results indicate the association of 14R and 14Myr with lipid vesicles, it may not have a direct bearing on the orientation of peptide segments in membranes as myristoylated proteins do not have transmembrane spanning segments. As myristoylation does not favor binding of hydrophilic peptide segments to membranes, the assumption that myristoylation is necessary for anchoring to membranes may not be a valid one. Our results are in agreement with a recent report that the Gibbs free energy for binding of a myristoylated peptide to a phospholipid vesicle is 8 Kcal/mol, equivalent to a KD of 10-4M, which is not sufficient for stable association of myristoylated peptide to the lipid bilayer (25Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar; 28Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The observation that in viral proteins the fatty acid is bound to proteins (5Chow M. Newman J.F.E. Filman D. Hogle J.M. Rowlands D.J. Brown F. Nature. 1987; 327: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and the possible existence of receptors for myristoylated peptides (27Resh M.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 281-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 1990; 12Goddard C. Arnold S.T. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15173-15176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the stable membrane-anchor function attributed to myristoylation may not be a valid one. The polarization value, the emission maximum and quenching experiments support an orientation of 31R in the bilayer as depicted in Fig. 9A. The N-terminal end of the helix is depicted to be relatively flexible. It is unlikely that the peptide is oriented in the manner shown in Fig. 9B as quenching by I¯ is discernible, which would not be the case were it to be oriented near the inner leaflet of the membrane. Thus, the peptide 31R corresponding to the membrane-spanning region of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein appears to insert into the lipid bilayer such that the C-terminal portion is localized near the head group region of the inner leaflet. However, for the acylated peptide we propose an orientation where the helix axis is at an angle and not perpendicular to the bilayer surface (Fig. 9C). The Trp residue would be associated with the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer and with a relatively restricted motion. Another possible orientation is shown in Fig. 9D. This structure would need reversal of peptide chain in the bilayer, i.e. formation of a helical hairpin. This model is quite unlikely as none of the amino acids in the hydrophobic core would favor a bend or chain reversal although there are two glycines present. Hence, in vivo it is likely that the modification of palmitoylation especially in proteins having transmembrane segments may serve to tilt the membrane-spanning segments from its orientation perpendicular to the bilayer surface. In fact, an orientation almost parallel to the bilayer surface is conceivable. This would also enable interaction with segments of proximal proteins in the membrane. Based on our investigations, we would like to propose the following. (i) The primary role of myristoylation may not be an anchor for stable membrane attachment as assumed. (ii) Palmitoylation in the case of transmembrane proteins could serve to realign the transmembrane segment from an orientation perpendicular to the bilayer surface. (iii) In the case of proteins where there is no hydrophobic segment, palmitoylation may not serve as a membrane anchor and could be involved in interaction with membrane-bound proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1993075796,"C5a, a potent chemoattractant for monocytes, neutrophils, and other leukocytes, binds to a cell surface receptor of the seven-transmembrane superfamily. Here we report the effects of substituting Gln for Glu199 of the human C5a receptor (hC5aR) expressed in a model cell system for chemoattractant receptor signaling, the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. Both the binding affinity for hC5a and the EC50 for subsequent cellular signals are reduced 5-10-fold by this substitution. A peptide mimic of the C terminus of C5a also binds to, and activates, hC5aR. The response to this peptide is reduced in cells bearing mutated hC5aR, indicating that the mutation affects interactions with the C terminus of hC5a. The C-terminal peptide contains only two basic residues, a Lys and an Arg (assumed to be analogous to Lys68 and Arg74 of hC5a), which could act as counter-ions for Glu199 of the receptor. If the counter-ion on hC5a was Arg74, then it would be expected that intact hC5a and hC5a des-Arg74 would have identical affinities and potencies when interacting with mutant hC5aR. It was found, however, that the binding affinity and potency (for receptor signaling events) of hC5a des-Arg74 was always lower than for intact hC5a. Furthermore, the equivalent C-terminal peptide to hC5a des-Arg74 (i.e. lacking the C-terminal Arg) could partially activate the wild type but not the mutant receptor, whereas the converse peptide, containing Arg but containing Met instead of Lys, had equal potencies for both wild type and mutant receptors. Taken together these data indicate that Glu199 of hC5aR is not involved in an interaction with Arg74 of hC5a, but may interact with Lys68 of hC5a. Mutation of Glu199 defines a second ligand binding site on hC5aR, distinct from the previously characterized site on the receptor N terminus. Unlike the N-terminal binding site, this second site is associated not just with the interaction with hC5a, but also with receptor activation."

Deutscher, submitted for publication. has recently been presented. Previously published work did not lead to identification of the sugar phosphate phosphatase that is activated by HPr(Ser(P)) and S46D HPr. A sugar phosphate phosphatase was purified and characterized from L. lactis (Thompson and Chassy, 1983Thompson J. Chassy B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its involvement in inducer expulsion was not demonstrated. We therefore set out to identify the enzyme that is the target of HPr(Ser(P)) action. We were able to show that the phosphatase of Thompson and Chassy (here termed phosphatase I or Pase I) is not activated by S46D HPr. By contrast, a membrane-associated sugar phosphate phosphatase (here termed phosphatase II or Pase II) was found to be activated by S46D HPr. This enzyme could be solubilized from the membranes with the use of 8 M urea and 4% butanol and purified to near homogeneity. Its unusual properties and its functional interactions with HPr and various mutant derivatives of HPr are herein described. Sugar phosphate phosphatase activity was routinely determined by a modification of the method described by Parvin and Smith, 1969Parvin R. Smith R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Briefly, 10-25 μl of enzyme was added to a medium containing 50 mM MES (pH 7.0), 20 mM MgSO4, and various concentrations (usually 10 or 20 mM) of one of several sugar phosphates. Assay solutions (50 μl, final volume) were incubated at 40°C for 10-30 min. Isobutanol (1 ml) and 4.25% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 0.43 M sulfuric acid (0.3 ml) were then added, and phosphate was extracted into the organic phase by vigorous mixing for 20 s. When the organic phase had cleared, 1 ml was removed and mixed by immediately vortexing with 1 μl of 4% (w/v) SnCl2 in concentrated HCl before measurement of the optical density at 760 nm. [14C]TMG-6-phosphate was prepared by using starved cells of L. lactis as described by Thompson and Saier(1981). [14C]TMG-6-phosphate phosphatase activity was measured as follows. 1.5 mM [14C]TMG-6-phosphate (specific activity, 0.5 mCi/mmol, purified as previously described (Ye et al., 1994aYe J.-J. Reizer J. Cui X. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11837-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Ye et al., 1994bYe J.-J. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3421-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) was added to the same assay solution described above lacking a sugar phosphate substrate. The assay solution was then incubated for up to 2 h before measuring the proportion of free [14C]TMG by ion exchange chromotography (5 × 0.5 cm, column size) as previously outlined (Kundig and Roseman, 1971Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTS enzyme I and HPr were assayed by complementation of mutant crude extracts as previously described (Mitchell et al., 1993Mitchell W.J. Reizer J. Herring C. Hoischen C. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2758-2761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the procedure of Lowry et al., 1951Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. L. lactis ML3 (12 liters for a typical enzyme preparation) was grown at 37°C for 16 h in LB medium containing 25 mM galactose as previously described (Ye et al., 1994aYe J.-J. Reizer J. Cui X. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11837-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 1994b). A final yield of about 45 g (wet weight) of cells was usually obtained. All purification procedures were conducted at 0-4°C. The washed cell pellet (about 45 g) was resuspended to a volume of 60 ml in HEPES buffer (pH 7.3) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 mM MnSO4 (HEDM buffer), as well as 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were disrupted by three successive passages through a French pressure cell (11,000 pounds per inch2 (76 megapascal)). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 90 min. The membranes were resuspended in HEDM buffer and treated with 8 M urea and 4% 1-butanol at 0°C for 30 min as previously described (Kundig and Roseman, 1971Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Saier et al., 1977Saier Jr., M.H. Feucht B.U. Mora W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8899-8907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed overnight against 11 liters of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The dialyzed, urea-butanol-treated supernatant (40 ml) was transferred (at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1) onto a DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange column (3 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with HEDM buffer. The proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0.1-0.4 M NaCl in HEDM buffer (see Fig. 1A). Fractions from the DEAE-Sephacel column that contained Pase II activity were pooled and concentrated to 3 ml by lyophilization. After addition of 0.5 ml of glycerol, the enzyme was loaded onto a Sephadex G-50-50 column (1.2 × 32 cm) preequilibrated and eluted with HEDM buffer. Fractions containing sugar phosphate phosphatase activity were combined, analyzed for purity, and used for characterization of enzymic properties (see Fig. 1B). Although Pase II was of about the same size as HPr, it exhibited no detectable HPr activity in complementation assays (Mitchell et al., 1993Mitchell W.J. Reizer J. Herring C. Hoischen C. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2758-2761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reciprocally, all HPr and mutant HPr derivative preparations tested for activation of Pase II lacked detectable phosphatase activity. The Pase II preparation purified through gel filtration was used in all analyses reported except for those presented in. SDS-electrophoresis was performed with a PhastSystem Separation and Control Unit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). 5 μl (from 0.1 to 5 μg of protein) of each sample was mixed with SDS sample buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and boiled at 100°C for 2 min before loading on a PhastGel (Gradient 8-25) for separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were visualized employing staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 by the procedure of Diezel et al., 1972Diezel W. Kopperschlager G. Hoffman E. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar. Aliquots of Pase II, purified through the gel filtration column, were incubated for 10 min in tubes submerged in a water bath at various temperatures ranging from 40 to 100°C. They were then chilled to 0°C in preparation for assay of the mannitol-1-P (20 mM) hydrolysis rate with or without 50 μM S46D HPr employing the standard assay conditions described above. Radiolabeled [14C]TMG (58 mCi/mmol) was from DuPont-NEN. Bio-safe II scintillation mixture was purchased from Research Products International Corp. (Mt. Prospect, IL). Analytical gradient anion-exchange resin AG1-X2 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Sephadex G-50-50 was from Sigma, and DEAE-Sephacel anion-exchange resin was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. PhastGels (Gradient 8-25) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separations were from Pharmacia Biotech AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Nonradioactive compounds, phosphorylated sugars, and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Crude extracts of L. lactis exhibited low degrees of stimulation of mannitol-1-P and [14C]TMG-phosphate phosphatase activities upon addition of S46D HPr (Table I). When the membrane fraction was separated from the soluble protein fraction by high speed centrifugation (200,000 × g for 2 h), the resuspended membranes exhibited activity that was enhanced by addition of S46D HPr to a greater extent than was observed for the crude extract. The soluble protein fraction exhibited more activity than did the membranes, but this activity exhibited almost no stimulation by S46D HPr (Table I). As noted below, the soluble fraction was enriched for Pase I while the membranes were enriched for Pase II. Membranes were therefore used as the preferred source of Pase II.Table I:Stimulation of phosphatase activity in a crude extract of L. lactis and in various partially purified fractions by S46D HPr Open table in a new tab The membranes were treated with 8 M urea and 4% butanol essentially as previously described (Kundig and Roseman, 1971Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1407-1418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Saier et al., 1977Saier Jr., M.H. Feucht B.U. Mora W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8899-8907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to release Pase II. After centrifugation to remove the membranes, and after removal of the butanol and urea by dialysis, the enzyme was purified by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An estimate of the -fold purification was not possible because of the presence of both Pase I and Pase II and possibly other sugar phosphate phosphatases. However, an approximately 50-fold increase in specific activity was observed during purification of the activity released from the membranes by butanol-urea extraction. Fig. 1 presents the elution profiles of activity from the DEAE-Sephacel I column (Fig. 1A) and the Sephadex G-50-50 gel filtration column (Fig. 1B). Pase I eluted from the ion exchange column at a salt concentration of about 0.2 M while Pase II eluted at about 0.33 M NaCl. The two activity peaks were clearly separated. While Pase I activity was not detectably stimulated by S46D HPr, Pase II activity was stimulated 5-10-fold (Table II).Table II:Substrate specificity of S46D HPr-stimulated sugar phosphate phosphatase II from L. Lactis Open table in a new tab Gel filtration (Fig. 1B) of the concentrated Pase II off of the DEAE-Sephacel column yielded a single major peak of activity, which eluted shortly after cytochrome c (Mr 12,000, see Fig. 1B). Its size was estimated at 9,000-10,000 Da. Gel electrophoresis revealed a single band that ran just ahead of HPr using the Coomassie Blue protein stain (data not shown). Pase II gave the following N-terminal sequence: APLKGRF. Only a single predominant amino acid (>80%) was present at each position. The amounts of these amino acids, relative to each other, were about the same, suggesting that they derived from a single protein. This enzyme was used for all remaining experiments reported below. presents data revealing the substrate specificity of the enzyme and its -fold stimulation by S46D HPr with each of the potential substrates tested. Almost all sugar phosphates tested were hydrolyzed, although to varying degrees, and the -fold stimulation by S46D HPr varied between 5- and 10-fold. In no case did S46A HPr stimulate the activity of Pase II. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were poor substrates, and the low activity observed with these substrates was not appreciably stimulated by S46D HPr. Using mannitol-1-P as the substrate, Pase II activity was found to be dependent on divalent cations. Regardless of concentration, Mg2+ appeared to be most effective. Mg2+ stimulated half-maximally at a concentration of about 1 mM, and high concentrations were not inhibitory (data not shown). The stimulatory effect of Mg2+ was independent of S46D HPr. Other divalent cations (Mn2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+) stimulated to lesser degrees with decreasing efficacies in the order mentioned. Fluoride, which inhibited Pase I almost quantitatively under our standard assay condition (see also Thompson and Chassy, 1983Thompson J. Chassy B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had no effect on the activity of Pase II when present in 2-fold excess over the Mg2+ concentration. The pH curves with and without S46D HPr are shown in Fig. 2. In both cases, the pH optimum was about 7 to 8. Stimulation by S46D HPr was maximal within this pH range. In the absence of S46D HPr, Pase II exhibited low affinity for its sugar substrates. For example, the apparent Km for mannitol-1-P was 50 mM. When 35 μM S46D HPr was added, the Km decreased to about 7 mM, and the Vmax increased about 50% (Fig. 3). No apparent cooperativity (sigmoidicity of the v versus S curve) was observed either in the presence or the absence of S46D HPr. The dependence of the activity on S46D HPr is shown in Fig. 4. Under the assay conditions used, 50 μM S46D HPr gave maximal activity with half-maximal activation occurring at about 13 μM. The curve was hyperbolic, consistent with a lack of cooperativity for substrate binding. In agreement with these results, chemical cross-linking experiments with disuccinimidyl tartarate conducted as described by Belogrudov et al., 1995Belogrudov G.I. Tomich J.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol.Chem. 1995; 270: 2053-2060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar revealed that Pase II alone or S46D alone each gave only one band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 9-10 kDa, but when these two proteins were mixed prior to the addition of disuccinimidyl tartarate, an additional band of about 18-20 kDa was observed. A 1:1 stoichiometry of binding is therefore suggested. Table III presents the effects of HPr, HPr(Ser(P)), and various mutant derivatives of HPr on the activity of the purified Pase II. When used at a concentration of 15 μM, HPr(Ser(P)) was substantially more stimulatory than was S46D HPr. When used at near saturating concentrations (50 μM), S46D HPr and the double mutant, H15E,S46D HPr, were equally stimulatory. All other derivatives of HPr tested were essentially without effect (I).Table III:Stimulation of purified phosphatase II by various HPr derivatives Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 shows the effects of a short preincubation of Pase II at temperatures ranging from 40 to 100°C on the activities of the purified enzyme. Basal Pase II activity using mannitol-1-P as substrate was unaffected by thermal exposure, even at a preincubation temperature of 100°C. By contact, the stimulatory effect of S46D HPr was gradually lost to increasing degrees when the enzyme was exposed to temperatures ranging from 50 to 100°C. The enzyme preincubated at 100°C exhibited little stimulation. The results suggest that while the active site of the enzyme is heat stable, the S46D HPr interaction site is less stable. Inducer expulsion in Gram-positive bacteria possessing a PTS is mediated by a metabolite-activated, ATP-dependent protein kinase. A cytoplasmic sugar phosphate phosphatase has been implicated in the process (See Introduction). Prior to this report, nothing was known about the enzyme that catalyzed this reaction. Using S46D HPr stimulation of sugar phosphate phosphatase activity as an assay, we have purified a phosphatase (termed Pase II) from L. lactis extracts that exhibits unusual properties as follows. 1) It has an exceptionally small catalytic subunit, possessing a molecular mass of less than 10,000 Da, based on both gel filtration of the native enzyme and SDS-gel electrophoresis of the denatured enzyme. A small size had been suggested early in our studies by the observation that the enzyme passed through dialysis tubing at a rate comparable to that of HPr.3 3J.-J. Ye and M. H. Saier, Jr., unpublished observations. 2) While Pase II elutes from DEAE Sephacel ion exchange columns at a high (0.33 M) NaCl concentration, Pase I elutes at a much lower salt concentration (0.2 M), suggesting that Pase II may be a much more acidic protein than is Pase I. 3) The activity of Pase II, like that of Pase I, is stimulated by various divalent metal ions, with Mg2+ being preferred. However, unlike most phosphatases, including Pase I (Thompson and Chassy, 1983Thompson J. Chassy B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fluoride is apparently not inhibitory under the assay conditions used. 4) In contrast to Pase I, which has a low pH optimum (Thompson and Chassy, 1983Thompson J. Chassy B.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 70-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Pase II exhibits a high pH optimum. 5) Pase II seems to be predominantly peripherally associated with the particulate fraction while Pase I is predominantly soluble in crude extracts. The former enzyme can be quantitatively solubilized by treatment with 8 M urea in the presence of 4% butanol according to the procedure of Kundig and Roseman(1971). This fact suggests that the enzyme is not an integral constituent of the membrane. 6) In contrast to Pase I, which is not affected by HPr and its derivatives, Pase II is specifically activated by HPr(Ser(P)), S46D HPr, and H15E,S46D HPr. Non-phosphorylated wild-type HPr and other mutant derivatives of HPr did not activate Pase II. The binding stoichiometry is apparently 1:1. These facts suggest that Pase II directly binds HPr(Ser(P)) to initiate inducer expulsion in lactococci. 7) Physiological concentrations of S46D HPr both lower the Km for sugar phosphate and increase the Vmax for sugar phosphate hydrolysis, thereby accounting for stimulation of the activity of Pase II. It is interesting to note that while Pase II is activated by H15E,S46D HPr as well as S46D HPr, only the latter HPr derivative could bind to the CcpA protein, a mediator of catabolite repression in B. subtilis(Haguenauer and Képés, 1971Haguenauer R. Képés A. Biochimie (Paris). 1971; 53: 99-107Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar).2 Finally, while Pase II activity appears to be heat stable, its activation by S46D HPr is heat labile. This last observation may suggest that the interaction of Pase II with S46D HPr is dependent on a conformation of the enzyme that is not required for catalysis. The results summarized in this paper serve to characterize the phosphatase that is most probably responsible for the inducer expulsion phenomenon in L. lactis and possibly in other Gram-positive bacteria as well. Its small size suggests that it will prove ideal material for structural studies employing both multidimensional NMR and x-ray crystallography. Since high resolution three-dimensional structures of HPr are already available (Wittekind et al., 1989Wittekind M. Reizer J. Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Klevit R.E.

On the contrary, this agent potentiated Ca2+ influx after addition of 1-10 mM Ca2+ by 13-fold versus control. Prior stimulation of [Ca2+]i with 10−7M arginine-vasopressin had similar effects, enhancing the subsequent Ca2+ influx. Enhancement of Ca2+ influx by sCT was confirmed by increased Mn2+ quenching of fura-2 fluorescence. In conclusion, arginine-vasopressin or calcitonin enhance Ca2+ influx in LLC-PK1 cells via a Ca2+ release-activated conductance, probably dependent upon capacitative Ca2+ entry.

CT administration results in a reduction of the Ca2+ concentration in the extracellular fluid ([Ca2+]o)(4Azria M. The Calcitonins. S. Karger, Basel1989Google Scholar). This is accomplished via inhibition of the bone resorbing activity of the osteoclast (5Chambers T.J. McSheehy P.M.J. Thomson B.M. Fuller K.

Most cellular effects of CT are associated with activation of the adenylyl cyclase pathway(9Goldring S.R. Dayer J.-M. Ausiello D.A. Krane S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, recently it has become apparent that the CTR is also associated with the phospholipase C enzyme pathway(11Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which induces breakdown of membrane phosphoinositol lipids to yield inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol. The two second messenger molecules, in turn, stimulate Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm from intracellular pools, and activate the serine/threonine protein kinase C, respectively(13Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar, 14Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar). A recent report by Stroop et al.(15Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19927-19930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested that the CTR functions as a [Ca2+]o sensor. A [Ca2+]o sensor has been proposed as a mechanism that allows the cell to sense increases of [Ca2+]o in the millimolar range, and to respond with significant elevations of the cell signal cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i)(16Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. Zambonin Zallone A. Teti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Patchell A. Moonga B. MacIntyre I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Should the CTR operating as a [Ca2+]o sensor be confirmed, the observation would be of great interest, in view of the fact that only selected cell types, including the CTR-expressing osteoclasts(16Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. Zambonin Zallone A. Teti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Patchell A. Moonga B. MacIntyre I. Biochem. Biophys.

Karger, Basel1989Google Scholar) would thus be predicted to activate the calcium sensor activity of the CTR resulting in modulation of osteoclast function. A synergistic role of the two factors, CT and elevated [Ca2+]o, would reciprocally potentiate the cellular responses. The [Ca2+]o sensing receptor, recently cloned and characterized from bovine parathyroid glands(18Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar), predicts a ≅120-kDa seven-trans membrane domain receptor, which shares limited similarity to the metabotropic glutamate receptor(19Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Its extracellular domain contains clusters of acidic amino acid residues, which are likely to represent a Ca2+ binding sequence, whereas the intracellular domain shows sequences similar to those of other G-protein-coupled receptors. The predicted structure of the CTR is unrelated to that of the [Ca2+]o sensing receptor, since it lacks similarity in amino acid sequence and does not possess extracellular putative Ca2+-binding consensus sequences(1Lin Y.H. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This observation argues against the CTR functioning as a [Ca2+]o sensor. The present studies were undertaken to more rigorously analyze the CTR for Ca2+ sensing function. We have performed single cell [Ca2+]i studies, by fura-2 microfluorometry, in CTR-positive cells in vitro employing the LLC-PK1 cell line(1Lin Y.H. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1022-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and the PC1 cells, a line derived from MC-3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with the CTR cloned from LLC-PK1 cells(15Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19927-19930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nonstimulated conditions, both cell types were insensitive to an elevated [Ca2+]o, whereas upon stimulation with sCT they acquired the capability of responding to an increase of [Ca2+]o with a [Ca2+]ielevation. Characterization of the mechanism inducing the [Ca2+]o-dependent [Ca2+]i elevation, however, demonstrated that this was exclusively due to Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, induced by a nonspecific post-receptor event that was not unique for the CTR but was shared by arginine-vasopressin (AVP), another Ca2+-mobilizing hormone. Dulbecco's modified and α modified minimum essential media, fetal bovine serum, reagents, and sterile plasticware for cell culture were from Flow Laboratory (Irvine, CA). Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionomycin and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Salmon calcitonin was kindly donated by Drs. Francesco Bartucci and Vera Calcagno, Sandoz Prodotti Farmaceutici S.p.A. (Milan, Italy). All other reagents were from Sigma. LLC-PK1 cells are a porcine kidney epithelial cell line previously characterized in our laboratory (9). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and fed once a week. At confluence, cells were split 1:20 by standard trypsin procedures. PC1 cells were obtained by stable transfection of MC-3T3-E1 cell line as described previously(11Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in α modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, fed once a week, and split 1:3 every 7-14 days. MC-3T3-E1 cells were grown in the same condition as PC1 cells. Bathing medium through all experiments was a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (KHH) with or without 1.25 mM Ca2+, buffered with 20 mM HEPES, and containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. [Ca2+]iof nonconfluent monolayers of LLC-PK1, PC1, and MC-3T3-E1 cell lines was measured by dual wavelength fluorescence of cells loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive intracellular probe fura-2(16Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. Zambonin Zallone A. Teti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Cells, seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 100,000/3.5-cm diameter dish, were loaded with 3 μM fura-2/AM in serum-free medium, at 37°C for 60 min. Measurements were performed in single cells, at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths, with an AR-CM fluorometer (Spex Industries, Inc., Edison, NJ) connected with a Diaphot TMD inverted microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Nikon CF X40 objective. Emissions were collected by a photomultiplier carrying a 510-nm cut-off filter and recorded by an ASEM Desk 2010 computer (ASEM S.p.A, Buia, Italy), which automatically calculated real-time 340/380 ratios. Calibration of the signal was obtained at the end of each observation by adding 5 μM ionomycin to saturate the dye to maximal fluorescence, followed by 7.5 mM EGTA plus 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 10.5, to release Ca2+ from fura-2 and obtain minimal fluorescence. [Ca2+]i was calculated according to previously described formulas(20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Data are presented as average ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). p < 0.05 was conventionally considered to indicate statistical significance. For the dose-response data, when ANOVA revealed a statistical significance, Student's t test was used. Basal [Ca2+]i in LLC-PK1, PC1 and MC-3T3-E1 cells is indicated in Table I. In all cell types [Ca2+]iremained stable over a period of at least 30 min. No spontaneous fluctuations were observed.Table I:Effect of sCT on [Ca2+]i of single LLC-PK1, PC1, and MC-3T3-E1 cells Open table in a new tab Fig. 1A and Table II show events elicited in LLC-PK1, PC1, and MC-3T3-E1 cells by treatment with 1 and 10 mM Ca2+. Unless otherwise specified, Ca2+ was added to the 1.25 mM Ca2+-containing KHH buffer; therefore, the final [Ca2+]o was 2.25 and 11.25, respectively. This elevation of the [Ca2+]o did not show ability to elicit a [Ca2+]i response in the cells. No significant differences were observed in high Ca2+-treated cells versus control [Ca2+]i levels.Table II:Effect of 1 and 10 mM Ca2+ on [Ca2+]i of LLC-PK1, PC1, and MC-3T3-E1 cells Open table in a new tab LLC-PK1 and PC1 cells were similarly sensitive to sCT, whereas MC-3T3-E1 cells failed to show sensitivity to the hormone. Table I illustrates the effect of 10−7M sCT on [Ca2+]i. The hormone induced a severalfold increase of [Ca2+]iover basal levels in the two CT-sensitive cell types. Responses were transient, with a [Ca2+]i peak followed by a decrease to lower levels. Fig. 1B and Table II show events elicited by addition of 1 and 10 mM Ca2+ in LLC-PK1, PC1 and MC-3T3-E1 cells pretreated with 10−7M sCT. Ca2+ was added to the cells during the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation induced by sCT. Addition of Ca2+ resulted in a significant [Ca2+]i elevation in LLC-PK1 and PC1, but not in MC-3T3-E1 cells (Table II). LLC-PK1 cells were utilized to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+]itransients induced by sCT. Fig. 2 shows concentration-dependent curves obtained in LLC-PK1 cells treated with the doses of [Ca2+]o as indicated on the abscissa. These curves were constructed computing peak [Ca2+]i in cells equilibrated in Ca2+-free KHH, to which Ca2+ was added to the final desired concentration from 1 M CaCl2 stock solution. In the absence of sCT, cells showed low sensitivity to elevated [Ca2+]o, even though responses were approximately 2-fold higher compared to those observed when the same doses of CaCl2 were added to cells equilibrated in the 1.25 mM Ca2+-containing KHH. Treatment with 10−7M sCT significantly enhanced the [Ca2+]o-induced [Ca2+]iincrease. Maximal response was observed at 10 mM Ca2+, with EC50 = 6 mM Ca2+. In Fig. 3A the effect of chelation of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA is shown. Addition of 1.25 mM EGTA slightly reduced [Ca2+]i. In this circumstance, cells responded to sCT with a rapid transient increase of [Ca2+]i, which peaked at 133 ± 27 nM (n = 6), a level approximately 4-fold lower than that observed in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Then, [Ca2+]irapidly returned toward base line. No sustained phase was observed. Subsequent addition of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in a rapid, sustained [Ca2+]i elevation. This indicates that sCT treatment has two effects. First, it is capable of stimulating Ca2+ release from intracellular storing organelles, even in Ca2+-free conditions. Second, sCT stimulates a large inward Ca2+ flux from the extracellular environment, abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA. This is further confirmed by the experiment shown in Fig. 3B. A single LLC-PK1 cell has been stimulated by sCT to obtain the [Ca2+]i increase. During the sustained phase, the cell was treated with LaCl3, an agent known to block all Ca2+ influx mechanisms across the plasma membrane(21Menè P. Teti A. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 122-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the presence of La3+, [Ca2+]i rapidly dropped to near basal levels, indicating once again the sustained phase to be dependent upon Ca2+ influx. Addition of 1-10 mM Ca2+ in the presence of La3+ failed to induce a significant [Ca2+]i rise compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3B, Table III). This indicates that Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+]i increase stimulated by sCT largely depends on gating of Ca2+ channels of the plasma membrane.Table III:Effect of La3+, thapsigargin, and AVP on Ca2+ influx in LLC-PK1 cells Open table in a new tab To rule out the potential confounding effects of modifications in Ca2+ efflux, and to confirm that actual Ca2+ influx was responsible for the changes in [Ca2+]i, we performed experiments with Mn2+ quenching of the fura-2 dye to monitor influx of another extracellular divalent cation. Mn2+ permeates the cell through the same channels employed by Ca2+, rapidly quenching fura-2 fluorescence by irreversible binding(22Hallam T.J. Jacob R. Merritt J.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In Fig. 4A, addition of sCT in the presence of Mn2+ resulted in a rapid increase of fura-2 fluorescence, followed by a slow progressive reduction. Similar fura-2 quenching was observed in cells pretreated with sCT and then with 1 and 10 mM Ca2+ prior to addition of Mn2+ (Fig. 4B). This further indicates that both the sustained phase observed during stimulation with sCT and the [Ca2+]i increase observed in cells further challenged with high Ca2+ are due to massive influx of divalent cations across the plasma membrane. The [Ca2+]o-dependent elevation of [Ca2+]i could not be explained by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, as it was persistent (Fig. 1B). However, to further examine the role of Ca2+ stores in the sCT-induced Ca2+ influx, we performed experiments involving Ca2+ depletion by thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the Ca2+ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum(23Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the effect of thapsigargin on the signal induced by sCT. Thapsigargin transiently increased [Ca2+]i to 558 ± 39 (n = 4) and completely abolished the response of the cell to sCT, indicating that Ca2+ release from the stores is involved not only in the sCT-induced peak increase of [Ca2+]i, but also in the secondary Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. This is further demonstrated in experiments (not shown) in which Ca2+ depletion was obtained by treatment with 1 μM of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, in which we observed similar complete inhibition of the response to sCT. We next examined whether depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores modulated the response of the cells to elevated extracellular Ca2+. To accomplish this, we treated the LLC-PK1 cells with thapsigargin and then added 1-10 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). In this circumstance, thapsigargin not only failed to prevent, but, similar to sCT, significantly stimulated Ca2+ entry into the cells (I). Finally, we depleted Ca2+ stores with a physiologic stimulus. LLC-PK1 cells are known to express Ca2+ mobilizing receptors for AVP. Therefore, we pretreated the cells with AVP and observed a rapid [Ca2+]itransient with a peak and a sustained phase (Fig. 6). Similar to sCT, addition of 1-10 mM Ca2+ in the presence of AVP greatly stimulated [Ca2+]i increases with a similar pattern (Fig. 6, I). This indicates that the effect of sCT on Ca2+ influx in LLC-PK1 cells is not unique for the CTR but is shared by other Ca2+ mobilizing receptors, such as the V1-type AVP receptor.Figure 6:Effect of AVP on [Ca2+] of a single LLC-PK1 cell. A single cell was first challenged with 10−7M AVP, which elicited a [Ca2+] transient, then with 1 and 10 mM Ca2+. This maneuver stimulated Ca2+ influx similar to that observed in sCT-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cultured LLC-PK1 and PC1 cells express abundant CTRs (1Lin Y.H.

Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore represent an excellent model for studying the signal transduction pathways activated by sCT. The two cell lines respond to sCT with typical, biphasic [Ca2+]i transients, a feature of the signaling pathway involving phospholipase C(13Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6136) Google Scholar). The initial rise has been demonstrated to result from a direct effect of InsP3 on InsP3-activated Ca2+ channels in intracellular Ca2+ storing organelles(11Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar). The sustained elevation that follows the initial peak is due to persistent Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane(11Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar). The amplitude of the sustained phase, which is responsible for the maintenance of [Ca2+]i higher than basal for several minutes, suggests that the predicted Ca2+ influx mechanism shows a large conductance, determined by an extensive Ca2+ movement across the plasma membrane. This study provides evidence that the sCT-induced Ca2+ conductance is significantly stimulated when the Ca2+ gradient on the two sides of the plasma membrane is increased. This causes a [Ca2+]i increase, which is prolonged in nature and lasts several minutes. Such a feature argues against the activation of a [Ca2+]o sensing, since this should result in a transient [Ca2+]i rise that would be abolished by agents that deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores(16Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. Zambonin Zallone A. Teti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zaidi M. Datta H.K. Patchell A. Moonga B. MacIntyre I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 24Nemeth E.F. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5188-5196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brown E.M. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 371-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that activation of the CTR in LLC-PK1 cells induces a nonspecific Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ influx. This is demonstrated by several observations. First, the release of Ca2+ is produced not only by sCT, but also by activation of another Ca2+ mobilizing receptor, such as the V1-type AVP receptor. Second, agents that nonspecifically stimulate Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, such as thapsigargin, promote Ca2+ internalization similar to that induced by sCT and AVP. As a result of these observations, we can expect that activation of the Ca2+ conductance does not require receptor occupancy. This rules out the involvement of InsP3 as a direct second messenger necessary for determining the sCT-induced Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+]i rise. The relevance of the activity of membrane Ca2+ channels is further demonstrated by experiments involving blockade of Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment. La3+, a nonspecific inhibitor of all Ca2+ entry mechanisms, is significantly active in blocking both the sustained phase induced by sCT and the additional [Ca2+]i increase due to addition of Ca2+ to the bathing buffer. Experiments performed with Mn2+ further confirm that influx of divalent cations is already occurring upon stimulation with sCT, and that it proceeds when an elevated [Ca2+]o is created. According to these results, we hypothesize that the CTR does not function as a [Ca2+]o sensor. This argues against the data reported by Stroop et al.(15Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19927-19930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who studied a recombinant human CTR transfected in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. In our hands, the mechanism stimulated by sCT resembles that described first by Casteels and Droogmans (26Casteels R. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. 1981; 317: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and then by Takemura and Putney (27), which has been termed “capacitative Ca2+ entry,” or “store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway”(28Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29451-29456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to Putney and Bird(29Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.St. J. Cell. 1993; 75: 199-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), a capacitative Ca2+ entry is stimulated by Ca2+ mobilizing signals, through activation of PLC-coupled receptors. It is largely accepted that InsP3, produced by phospholipase C-dependent membrane phosphoinositol lipid breakdown, is responsible for such Ca2+ influx via a secondary, indirect mechanism(30Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2077) Google Scholar). The most compelling evidence for this hypothesis comes from the observation that inhibitors of the microsomal Ca2+ATPase, such as thapsigargin, which cause depletion of intracellular stores without InsP3 production, mimic the effect of surface membrane InsP3-linked agonists to activate Ca2+ entry (29). Regardless of the primary process that produces intracellular Ca2+ pool depletion, capacitative Ca2+ entry allows the emptied stores to be rapidly refilled, in order to restore the resting conditions(26Casteels R. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. 1981; 317: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 27Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. Alvarez J. J. Biol.

The mechanism producing the capacitative Ca2+ influx has not yet been fully elucidated. It implies a system for communication between the Ca2+ pool and the plasma membrane, such that the permeability of the plasma membrane would be increased when the intracellular pool is empty(27Takemura H. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To date two fundamental mechanisms for the retrograde signal for capacitative Ca2+ entry have been considered; (i) a diffusible messenger is produced or released when the intracellular stores are depleted, diffuses to the plasma membrane and activates Ca2+ entry(31Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 32Parekh A.B. Terlau H. Stühmer W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23597-23602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or (ii) the emptying of the intracellular Ca2+ stores causes a conformational change in the organelle and/or its surface proteins, and this information is delivered to the plasma membrane either by direct coupling (34Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) or via the cytoskeleton(35Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.St. J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study provides evidence indicating that a Ca2+ release Ca2+ influx mechanism is operating in the CTR-expressing LLC-PK1 and in the PC1 cells stably transfected with the CTR. This mechanism resembles the recently described capacitative Ca2+ entry observed in cells challenged with Ca2+ mobilizing agents. Such Ca2+ influx is not due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, but rather is stimulated by Ca2+ store depletion. These results seem to rule out the CTR functioning as a [Ca2+]o sensor.

In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, ATP as well as bradykinin stimulated significantly higher increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation than did Leu-EK; however, the magnitude of intracellular Ca2+ pools increased after ATP stimulation, whereas bradykinin depleted intracellular pools. Hence, cells lost their [Ca2+]i response to Leu-EK if bradykinin was first added to induce a [Ca2+]i increase, whereas the response was unchanged if Leu-EK was added after addition of ATP. When Leu-EK was added simultaneously with bradykinin or ATP, an additive response was observed in IP3 generation; however, the rise in [Ca2+]i reached the same level as that induced by bradykinin or ATP alone. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in which the replenishment of intracellular pools was not possible, ATP displayed an inhibitory effect similar to that of bradykinin on the Leu-EK-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Prior treatment of cells with Leu-EK slightly heterologously desensitized the action of bradykinin, but had no effect on the ATP response. Our results suggest that a shared intracellular Ca2+ pool is sensitive to the opioid, bradykinin and P2-purinoceptor agonists; however, a defined pool of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate or a specific phospholipase C is responsible for each receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2056574328,"Two cDNA clones encoding distinct forms of plastid pyruvate kinase (designated Pka and Pkg) have recently been characterized. Pkg is found in both leucoplasts and chloroplasts, whereas Pka is present only in leucoplasts. The precursors of these proteins have different in vitro import characteristics. The Pkg precursor behaves like a typical stromal protein precursor with both types of plastid. In contrast, Pka precursors accumulate on the outer envelope membrane of leucoplasts under the same assay conditions and require a higher level of ATP for import into the organelle. Interestingly, the binding of Pka precursors to chloroplasts cannot be detected at any tested level of ATP even though the precursors are imported into the organelle at higher concentrations of ATP. Various N-terminal deletions and chimeric fusions were used to examine the translocation signaling mechanism of the Pka precursor. The N-terminal 83-amino- acid segment of Pka contains a transit peptide that is capable of directing dihydrofolate reductase and the mature body of Pkg into both types of plastid. Unlike the complete Pka precursor, these fusion proteins behave like typical stromal protein precursors. The behavior of the Pka transit peptide is influenced by a 19-amino- acid domain (-P-S-S-I-E-V-D-A-V-T-E-T-E-L-K-E-N-G-F-) located immediately downstream of the N-terminal 83- residue segment. Deletion of this domain from Pka alters its import properties such that it resembles a typical stromal protein precursor. Re-introduction of the 19- residue domain into the Dhfr fusion protein alters its import characteristics to resemble that of the complete Pka precursor. This 19-amino-acid domain can also influence the function of transit sequences from other precursors when it is placed immediately behind the transit peptide. These results suggest that this 19-amino-acid domain plays an important role in governing the import characteristics of the Pka precursor. We have named this 19-residue segment the “import modifying domain.” Two cDNA clones encoding distinct forms of plastid pyruvate kinase (designated Pka and Pkg) have recently been characterized.

We have named this 19-residue segment the “import modifying domain.” Nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are usually synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and then targeted to the organelle. The translocation of protein precursors into the plastid is a complex process involving steps such as unfolding, binding to receptors on the outer envelope, and translocation across the two envelope membranes (for reviews see 16Keegstra K. Cell. 1989; 56: 247-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and 18Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Crossref Google Scholar). A low level of ATP (0.1 mM) is needed for high affinity binding of precursors to the plastid and a higher ATP level (1 mM) is required for completing translocation. The primary signal for directing precursor proteins through the translocation pathway usually resides in the amino terminus and is termed the transit peptide. Generally, the transit peptide contains sufficient information for the correct targeting of proteins into the plastid and for intraorganellar sorting. Although most plastid protein precursors are targeted to the organelle as described above, some variations have been reported. Four chloroplast outer envelope proteins (Om6.7, Om14, Sce70, and Omp24) possess an uncleavable “transit peptide” at the amino terminus, have ATP-independent uptake (with the exception of Omp24), and do not require protease-sensitive receptors. This suggests the presence of a pathway different from that used by other plastid proteins (30Salomon M. Fischer K. Flugge U.-I. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; 27Li H.-M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar; 36Wu C. Ko K. J. Biol.

The transit peptide of the maize inner envelope protein Bt1 and the Cab protein functions primarily as a stromal targeting sequence. Additional information targeting Bt1 to the inner envelope and Cab to the thylakoid is located in the mature region of the protein (5Cline K.

Removal of carboxyl domains of chloroplast precursor proteins has, in most cases, a dramatic effect on different stages of translocation such as import, processing, and intraorganellar targeting, suggesting that carboxyl-terminal sequences in the mature part of the proteins can influence the function of the transit peptide (22Ko K. Ko Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13910-13916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the signal determining a protein's import characteristics is highly complex and can be influenced by information in various parts of the polypeptide. Our current understanding of this phenomenon is mainly derived from proteins targeted to chloroplasts. It has been suggested that similar mechanisms operate in other types of plastid, e.g. leucoplasts, but there may also be unique signals for each functionally and structurally distinct plastid type. It is known that chloroplast protein precursors such as Rbcs1 1The abbreviations used are: Rbcsthe small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylasePkapyruvate kinase A formPkgpyruvate kinase G formDhfrmouse cytosolic dihydrofolate reductaseDSPdithiobis(succinimidylpropionate)DTSSP3, 3′-dithiobis(sulfonylsuccinimidylpropionate)IgGimmunoglobulin Gbpbase pair(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and plastocyanin can be imported into both chloroplasts and leucoplasts (4Boyle S.A.

These data suggest that a basic import mechanism exists and that different transit peptides can be recognized by all types of plastid. However, only a very small set of protein precursors have been studied. A study by 8Dahlin C. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar indicates that the import capability of plastids changes during development.

Leucoplasts are found primarily in nonphotosynthetic tissues such as the endosperm of developing castor seeds. Leucoplasts are metabolically active and are the site of fatty acid biosynthesis in developing oil seeds. In order to supply substrates and cofactors for the production of fatty acids, these organelles contain a glycolytic pathway, including the enzyme pyruvate kinase, that catalyzes the irreversible reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP to pyruvate and ATP. In this study, the availability of cDNA clones encoding two distinct forms of leucoplast pyruvate kinase (designated Pka and Pkg) (2Blakeley S.D. Plaxton W.C. Dennis D.T. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Blakeley S.D. Gottlob-McHugh S. Wan J. Crews L. Miki B. Ko K. Dennis D.T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) allowed us to study the mechanism by which leucoplastic proteins are imported into two different types of plastids, chloroplasts and leucoplasts. The import results provide evidence that Pka and Pkg behave differently toward the two types of plastid. We have identified a 19-amino-acid domain located immediately downstream of the Pka transit sequence which appears to alter the import characteristics of Pka in response to energy status and plastid type. Antibodies against castor Pka and tobacco Pkg were generated using fusion proteins as described by Wu and Ko(1993). The resulting fusion proteins contain carboxyl-terminal sequences of each pyruvate kinase and the T7 gene 10 polypeptide. Preimmune IgGs were collected prior to the injection of each rabbit. Subfractionation of leucoplasts and chloroplasts was according to 32Smeekens S. Bauerle C. Hageman J. Keegstra K. Weisbeek P. Cell. 1986; 46: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar. Plastid envelopes were subfractionated using discontinuous sucrose gradients (17Keegstra K. Yousif A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Castor leucoplasts and pea chloroplasts, membrane fractions, and stromal extracts were subjected to denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (33Towbin H.

Primary antibody reactions were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Promega). All DNA manipulations were performed according to established protocols. Castor Pka was subcloned into pGEM4 as a 2130-bp EcoRI cDNA fragment and was designated pCPka. SP6 RNA polymerase-generated Pka transcripts from pCPka did not give rise to in vitro translation products. Replacement of the 5′-untranslated sequence of castor Pka with the corresponding region from tobacco Pka did, however, result in successful in vitro translation. The 5′ sequence replacement was accomplished by inserting a 74-bp EcoRI-AluI DNA fragment encoding the 5′-untranslated sequence and first two amino acids of the tobacco Pka cDNA clone into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEM4 (Promega). The BamHI site was converted into a blunt end. The resulting vector was called pT5Pka. A 2120-bp BamHI-SacI DNA fragment encoding castor Pka and its 3′-untranslated sequence was subsequently inserted into pT5Pka. This final construct was designated pTCPka. This cloning scheme did not affect the amino acid sequence of the castor Pka protein. Tobacco Pkg was subcloned into pGEM5 as a 2000-bp PstI-NotI cDNA fragment and was designated pTPkg. The construction scheme for amino-terminal deletions of Pka and Pkg is illustrated in Fig. 5. A total of seven amino-terminal deletions were constructed for pTCPka. Five of the deletions resulted in the removal of 30, 83, 102, 110, and 141 amino acids from the amino terminus of pTCPka and were designated N1 to N5, respectively. The other two deletions resulted in the removal of 19 and 58 amino acids from residue 83 to 102 and from 83 to 141 at the amino terminus and were designated N6 and N7, respectively. The 19 amino acids are -P-S-S-I-E-V-D-A-V-T-E-T-E-L-K-E-N-G-F- (for the complete DNA sequence of Pka, see Blakeley et al.(1991)). In vitro transcription of these deletions was initiated from the SP6 promoter. A 1910-bp HpaII-SacI DNA fragment from pTCPka was inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites of pT5Pka. The BamHI site was converted into a blunt end by Klenow. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is M-S-R-Y-P-. pCPka was subcloned into pGEM4 in reverse such that the cDNA fragment is in the same direction as the T7 promoter. A 1806-bp BamHI-PstI DNA fragment was then obtained from this resulting plasmid and inserted into BamHI and PstI sites of pT5Pka. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is M-S-S-I-E-. The 1727- and 1703-bp RsaI-HincII DNA fragments were obtained from pTCPka and inserted into the HincII site of pT5Pka. The amino acid sequences at the fusion points are M-S-T-R-R- and M-S-T-I-G- for N3 and N4, respectively. A BsaAI digestion and religation were performed with the N3 construct removing a further 39 amino acids from the amino terminus. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is M-S-T-R-E. A 240-bp BamHI-SacI DNA fragment was obtained from the 5′ end of pTCPka and inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites of pT5Pka. This vector was then used to subclone a 1485-bp XbaI fragment excised from N3. This construct resulted in the removal of 19 amino acids from position 83 to 102. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is P-S-R-T-R-. A BsaAI digestion and religation were performed with the N6 deletion construct to delete a further 39 amino acids following the first 83 residues. N7 thus resulted in the removal of 58 amino acids from residue 83 to 141. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is S-R-T-R-E-. A 59-bp SalI-BamHI DNA fragment encoding the 5′-untranslated sequence and the first two residues of tobacco Pka was retrieved from pT5Pka and inserted into pGEM4 behind the T7 promoter. This vector was then used to subclone a 1664-bp SacI-NotI fragment excised from pTPkg at the SacI and EcoRI sites. The corresponding NotI and EcoRI sites were converted into blunt ends by Klenow. As a result, 87 amino acids from the amino terminus of tobacco Pkg were deleted. In vitro transcription of pNPkg was initiated from the T7 promoter. The amino acid sequence at the fusion point is M-S-N-S-P-. The chimeric constructs described in this section are illustrated in Fig. 7. In vitro transcription of these fusion constructs was initiated from the SP6 promoter. A 240-bp BamHI-SacI DNA fragment encoding the 5′ end of castor Pka was retrieved from pTCPka and inserted into the BamHI and SacI sites of pT5Pka. This new plasmid, in effect, encoded the first 83 amino acids of castor Pka and was designated pT5Pka1. pT5Pka1 was then used to construct both Pka1-Pkg and Pka1-Dhfr. Pka1-Pkg was made by inserting a 1664-bp SacI-NotI DNA fragment encoding the mature body of tobacco Pkg into the SacI and XbaI sites of pT5Pka1. The NotI and XbaI sites were converted into blunt ends. Pka1-Dhfr was constructed by inserting an EcoRI DNA fragment encoding mouse cytosolic Dhfr into the XbaI site of pT5Pka1. Both the EcoRI and XbaI sites were converted to blunt ends. A 455-bp SalI-EcoRI DNA fragment encoding the first 87 amino acids of tobacco Pkg was inserted into pGEM11Z(+). This new vector was then used to subclone a 1760-bp SacI DNA fragment encoding the mature body of castor Pka. A 401-bp EcoRI-AvaII DNA fragment was retrieved from pTCPka and inserted into pGEM4 at the EcoRI and SmaI sites. The AvaII site was converted into a blunt end. The resulting vector encoded the first 113 amino acids of castor Pka and was used to subclone an EcoRI DNA fragment of Dhfr in the XbaI site. Both the EcoRI and XbaI sites were converted to blunt ends. All of the constructs presented here were analyzed with restriction enzymes and sequencing to ensure that the fusion points were in-frame using established protocols. The growth conditions for castor plants (Ricinus communis L. cv Baker 296) and isolation of intact leucoplasts were carried out as described by Boyle et al.(1986). Castor seeds (stages 4-6) were selected according to the developmental profile described by 11Greenwood J.S. Bewley J.D. Can. J. Bot. 1982; 60: 1751-1760Crossref Google Scholar. Protein content of the isolated leucoplasts was determined using the BCA protein assay procedure (Sigma). The number of leucoplasts in the suspension was determined using a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics Inc.). Approximately 8 × 107 leucoplasts were used for each import reaction which is equivalent to about 200 μg of protein. The growth conditions for pea plants were the same as described by 21Ko K. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3187-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar. Intact pea chloroplasts were isolated from 14-day-old seedlings as described by 1Bartlett S.G. Grossman A.R.

Approximately 8 × 107 chloroplasts were used for each import reaction which is equivalent to 100 μg of chlorophyll. Import assays were assembled in 0.3-ml volumes as described in Bartlett et al.(1982). A typical import reaction contained intact plastids, 35S-labeled translation products, 10 mM methionine, 10 mM cysteine, 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 M sorbitol, and 1 mM ATP. Radiolabeled precursors were prepared as described by 37Wu C. Seibert F. Ko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32264-32271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. For binding assays, the ionophore, nigericin (400 nM final concentration), was used in place of ATP (7Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Lubben T. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3691-3696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assays were carried out under fluorescent light or in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Any modifications to the typical import reaction conditions are noted, where appropriate, in the text. Protease treatment, plastid reisolation, and subfractionation of the organelles were performed according to Smeekens et al.(1986). Chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Wu and Ko (1993). The chemical cross-linkers used were DSP (Sigma) and its water-soluble analog, DTSSP (Pierce). The cross-linkers were reversed using dithiothreitol in the loading dye. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and prepared for fluorography using EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN) and exposed to Kodak XAR x-ray films. The LKB ultrascan XL laser densitometer was used to quantitate and analyze the resulting fluorograms. The suborganellar location of Pka and Pkg was determined by subfractionation and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A). Anti-Pka IgGs immunoreacted with a major 63-kDa stromal protein and a minor 66-kDa band in the membrane fraction of leucoplasts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, and 4). Immunoreactions were not observed in purified pea chloroplasts or in castor leaf extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that Pka represents a leucoplast-specific enzyme. In intact leucoplasts, the 66-kDa polypeptide band is degraded by thermolysin suggesting that it is located on the cytosolic side of the leucoplast envelope. In contrast, the 63-kDa immunoreactive band is thermolysin-resistant indicating an internal location (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Upon subfractionation of the leucoplast envelope, the 66-kDa band co-fractionated with the outer envelope (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6). The identity of the inner and outer leucoplast envelope was confirmed by IgGs against the 37-kDa chloroplast inner membrane protein (Cim37) (9Dreses-Werringloer U. Fischer K. Wachter E. Link T.A. Flugge U.-I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the 70-kDa outer envelope polypeptide (Com70) (Wu et al., 1994). In the case of leucoplasts, anti-Cim37 IgGs immunoreacted with an inner membrane protein, and anti-Com70 antibodies immunoreacted to a polypeptide in both outer and inner membrane (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4). It is probable that the 66-kDa immunoreactive band represents the precursor form of Pka and that the 63-kDa protein band represents the imported, processed mature form. This possibility is supported by the observation that the 66-kDa band co-migrated with the in vitro Pka translation product (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 9) and evidence from the in vitro import studies (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 and 11) described below. The in vitro Pka translation product was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Pka IgGs but not by preimmune IgGs (Fig. 1A, lanes 12 and 13). Anti-Pkg IgGs immunoreacted with a 55-kDa band in purified castor leucoplasts, pea chloroplasts, and castor leaf extracts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 7, and 8). This protein was found only in the stroma of leucoplasts (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6). Hence, Pkg, unlike Pka, is present in the stroma of both leucoplasts and chloroplasts. The in vitro Pkg translation product is approximately 61 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 9), suggesting that a 6-kDa transit peptide has been removed on uptake. In vitro, the Pkg precursor is imported into both leucoplasts and chloroplasts and processed to a 55-kDa form (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 and 11). The in vitro Pkg translation product was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Pkg IgGs, but not by preimmune IgGs (Fig. 1A, lanes 12 and 13). The amount of Pka precursor and mature forms of Pka and Pkg was determined at various stages of castor endosperm development (Fig. 1C). The precursor form of Pka was detected at stage 4, was present from stage 4 to 7 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-6), and decreased by stage 8 (Fig. 1C, lane 7). Mature Pka could be detected at stage 1-2, increased to a maximum at stage 4, and remained relatively constant until stage 7, after which it declined (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-3 and 7). The level of mature Pka correlates with maximal fatty acid biosynthesis which occurs between stages 4 and 6 (31Simcox P.D. Garland W. Deluca V. Canvin D.T. Dennis D.T. Can. J. Bot. 1979; 57: 1008-1014Crossref Google Scholar). The developmental pattern of mature Pkg was similar to that of Pka (Fig. 1C). The in vitro import ability of the castor leucoplast was compared with the pea chloroplast by measuring the uptake of the pea Rbcs precursor (Fig. 2A). A post-treatment of the plastids with thermolysin or trypsin was employed to distinguish externally located or intermembrane proteins from those in the stroma (15Joyard J. Billecocq A. Bartlett S.G. Block M.A. Chua N.-H. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10000-10006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 6Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J.T. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Rbcs precursor associated with the leucoplast in the presence of nigericin, an ionophore that dissipates gradients across plastid membranes necessary for ATP production (Fig. 2A, lane 2). However, the assay did contain 25 μM ATP from the translation mixture. The associated precursor was thermolysin-sensitive (Fig. 2A, lane 3) indicating a location on the outside face of the envelope. In the presence of exogenously added ATP (1 mM), 30-40% of Rbcs was imported into leucoplasts and processed to the mature form in the stroma (Fig. 2A, lane 9). However, under these conditions, most of the Rbcs was present as full-length precursors and intermediate forms (Fig. 2A, lane 4) that co-fractionated with the membranes (Fig. 2A, lane 10). The precursor form of Rbcs appeared to be resistant to thermolysin (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Some of the intermediate forms were cleaved by thermolysin resulting in distinct smaller sized products (Fig. 2A, lane 5) that co-fractionated with the membranes (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8). However, the precursor and the intermediate forms were trypsin-sensitive (Fig. 2A, lane 6) whereas the mature form was resistant. Hence, although Rbcs is imported by leucoplasts, the uptake appears to be different from that found in chloroplasts suggesting some differences between the two types of plastid. Nevertheless, isolated leucoplasts are capable of importing proteins in a manner similar to that established for pea chloroplasts. The import of Pkg into leucoplasts is typical of stromal protein precursors. Pkg precursors associated with leucoplasts in the presence of nigericin and were sensitive to thermolysin (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). In the presence of 1 mM ATP, approximately 60% of the Pkg precursors were imported into the stroma and processed (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 9). The mature form was resistant to both thermolysin and trypsin (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-7). The mature form of Pkg is about 55 kDa, indicating that a 6-kDa transit peptide is cleaved upon uptake. The imported Pkg co-migrated with the 55-kDa immunoreactive stromal band (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 10). The import of Pka into leucoplasts is different from both Pkg and Rbcs. Pka precursors associated with the leucoplast envelope both in the presence of nigericin (Fig. 2A, lane 2) or 1 mM ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 4). These precursors were sensitive to both thermolysin and trypsin (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 5, and 6) and co-fractionated with the membranes (Fig. 2A, lane 10). Hence, unlike Pkg and Rbcs, Pka precursors accumulate on the outside surface of the leucoplast in the presence of 1 mM ATP. At this ATP concentration, Pka was not transported into leucoplasts even after 60 min (data not shown). It is probable that this form represents the 66-kDa immunoreactive band detected in the outer envelope. When the concentration of ATP was increased to 3 mM, about 50% of the Pka precursors were imported and processed to a protease-resistant 63-kDa protein in the stroma (Fig. 2A, lanes 4-7 and 9). The imported Pka co-migrated with the major 63-kDa immunoreactive band found in the leucoplast stroma (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 10). Therefore, a transit peptide of approximately 3 kDa is removed upon import suggesting that Pka is a precursor protein with a transit signal. The requirement of a higher level of ATP for Pka uptake suggests that Pka possesses atypical import characteristics in the leucoplast when compared with Pkg and Rbcs. The import of Pkg and Pka into pea chloroplasts was also studied. Pkg precursors were associated with the chloroplast envelope in the presence of nigericin and were susceptible to thermolysin (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). In the presence of 1 mM ATP, most Pkg precursors were imported and processed to a thermolysin- and trypsin-resistant 55-kDa stromal form. Little of the bound precursor remained (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-7 and 9). These import data are consistent with the immunoblots, where Pkg is found in the chloroplast (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 11). Unlike Pkg, Pka did not bind to the chloroplast envelope even in the presence of nigericin (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), but was imported into the stroma and processed to a protease-resistant 63-kDa form when the assays contained 1 mM ATP (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-10). The lack of detectable binding even when import was inhibited by nigericin is atypical for protein precursors destined for the chloroplast. The effect of ATP concentration (0 to 3 mM) on the import of Pka, Pkg, and Rbcs into leucoplasts and chloroplasts was investigated (Fig. 3). The import reactions were carried out under a dim green light to prevent light-dependent ATP production in the chloroplast. The overall import profiles of Rbcs and Pkg were very similar in both chloroplasts and leucoplasts. The amount of precursors bound to chloroplasts increased between 0 to 0.1 mM ATP (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and from 0 to 0.5 mM ATP for leucoplasts (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-4). Further increases in the ATP concentration resulted in a decrease in bound precursor with a concomitant increase in the level of import. The imported mature for"

This mixture binds colchicine normally, and we show here by direct photoaffinity labeling that the bulk of the [<sup>3</sup>H]colchicine becomes attached to β-tubulin under these conditions. When the α-tubulin has been displaced by lactoperoxidase, the ratio of label in β-tubulin to α-tubulin is increased. The amount of label in α-tubulin decreases with a corresponding appearance of label in lactoperoxidase. The <i>rate</i> of labeling of β-tubulin remains slow. We conclude that α-tubulin is not necessary for colchicine binding and propose a model wherein the A and C rings of colchicine bind to β-tubulin, while the B ring faces α-tubulin in the dimer."

Chem. 1988; 263: 2761-2767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monomer is composed of 3 domains, a hydrophilic 430-residue-long NH2-terminal domain that binds NAD(H), a hydrophobic 400-residue-long central domain that is largely membrane-intercalated and harbors the proton channel of the enzyme, and a hydrophilic 200-residue-long COOH-terminal domain that binds NADP(H) (Yamaguchi et al., 1988; 40Yamaguchi M.

The transhydrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores has 3 subunits, designated α1, α2, and β for consistency with the earlier subunit designations of the E. coli enzyme (42Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; see also 37Williams R. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the R. rubrum transhydrogenase subunits are α1 = 40.3 kDa, α2 = 14.9 kDa, and β = 47.8 kDa. Subunit α1 is water-soluble and easily detached from chromatophores. Together the two subunits of the E. coli or the three subunits of the R. rubrum enzyme (the Rb. capsulatus transhydrogenase has not been sequenced) exhibit the same tridomain hydropathy profile as the bovine enzyme (Yamaguchi and Hatefi, 1994). In addition, the predicted amino acid sequences of putative single-subunit transhydrogenases from Eimeria tenella (17Kramer R.A. Tomchak L.A. McAndrew S.J. Becker K. Hug D. Pasamontes L. Hümbelin M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar; 33Vermeulen A.N. Kok J.J. Van den Boogaart P. Dijkema R. Claessens J.A.J. FEMS Microbiol.

Parasitol. 1994; 68: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) exhibit a similar hydropathy profile, except that they could be described as β-tail-to-α-head spliced versions of the E. coli enzyme. We have shown earlier that the bindings of NADPH and NADP, but not of NADH and NAD, alter the conformation of the bovine transhydrogenase in different ways and have argued on the basis of both theoretical considerations and experimental results that inside-to-outside proton translocation by the enzyme (reversal of Equation 1) is accomplished through substrate-induced conformation change of the protein and is paid for by the difference in the binding energies of substrates (NADPH + NAD) versus products (NADP + NADH). Because NADPH and NADP binding, but not NADH and NAD binding, results in detectable conformation changes of the bovine transhydrogenase, we further proposed that it is mainly the difference in the binding energies of NADPH and NADP that drives inside-to-outside proton translocation via protein conformation changes (39Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6050-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; 44Yamaguchi M. Wakabayashi S. Hatefi Y.

Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 265-281Google Scholar). The five transhydrogenases whose amino acid sequences are known contain regions of high sequence identity in the NAD(H) and especially the NADP(H) binding domains as well as in a 19-residue-long and a 58-residue-long stretch in the hydrophobic domain.2 2Following are the degrees of sequence identity in the 5 sequenced transhydrogenases for: 100 residues around the NAD(H) binding site, 26%; 100 residues around the NADP(H) binding site, 45%; the 19-residue-long hydrophobic segment, 58%; and the 58-residue-long hydrophobic segment, 65.5%. The 58-residue-long stretch is adjacent to the hydrophilic domain that binds NADP(H) (Fig. 1). Because such stretches of high sequence identity in the hydrophobic domains of related enzymes are rare, we felt that these membrane-intercalating regions may have functional significance with regard to the enzyme's proton translocation activity. In the entire 400-residue-long hydrophobic domains of the five sequenced transhydrogenases, there are only 4 conserved charged residues and 3 conserved histidine residues. In the 19-residue-long stretch of high sequence identity, there is a conserved histidine residue (E. coli βHis-91, see Fig. 1) which when mutated in the E. coli enzyme to Ser, Thr, or Cys results in ≥90% loss of transhydrogenation and proton pumping activities (11Holmberg E. Olausson T. Hultman T. Rydström J. Ahmad S. Glavas N.A. Bragg P.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7691-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As seen below, there is in the 58-residue-long stretch a conserved aspartic acid residue (E. coli βAsp-213, see Fig. 1) whose mutation in the E. coli enzyme to Asn resulted in our hands in ~70% activity loss (see also Holmberg et al.(1994)), but its mutation to Ile caused 90% loss of transhydrogenase and coupled proton translocation activities. Neither mutation greatly inhibited the NADP(H)-dependent cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation activity of the enzyme, which involves both the NAD and the NADP binding sites, but is not coupled to proton translocation (see below). However, the βD213I mutation increased the affinity of the enzyme for NADPH by 3-fold. The implications of these results with regard to energy transduction by the transhydrogenase will be discussed. NADPH, NAD, and ATP were obtained from Calbiochem; AcPyAD and NAD kinase were from Sigma; asolectin was from Associated Concentrates; Ultrogel AcA34 was from IBF Biotechnics; DEAE-Bio-Gel A agarose and Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro Mutagenesis Kit were from Bio-Rad; Sequenase version 1.0, nucleotide kit for DNA sequencing with 7-deaza-dGTP, and random-primed DNA labeling kit were from U.

Bacterial strains and plasmids were obtained from the following sources: E. coli strain MC4100 (F¯, araD139, Δ (arg F-lac)U169, ptsF25, relA1, flb5301, rpsL 150.λ¯) from ATCC; pBluescript II KS(+) from Stratagene; pUC4K plasmid from Pharmacia Biotech; pLC10-19 from the Clarke and Carbon Collection, carrying the E. coli transhydrogenase gene (3Clarke D.M.

Bachman (E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University); pDC21, a derivative of pUC13, carrying the E. coli transhydrogenase gene (Clarke and Bragg, 1985), was the generous gift of Dr. P. D. Bragg, University of British Columbia; and pMAK705, whose replication is temperature-sensitive and carries the chloramphenicol resistance gene (8Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P.

From pLC10-29, a 4.8-kilobase HindIII fragment carrying the transhydrogenase coding region was excised and inserted into the HindIII site of pBluescript II. By digestion of the constructed plasmid with HpaI, a 2.7-kilobase fragment, covering most of the transhydrogenase coding region, was cut out and replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene cartridge from pUC4K. Then the whole insert was excised with EcoRV and inserted into the HindIII site of pMAK705 (pMAKTK). As described by Hamilton et al.(1989), pMAKTK was integrated into the chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain MC4100, and then the transhydrogenase genes were replaced by the kanamycin resistance gene (strain MC4100 TH¯). The gene replacement was confirmed by 32Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar. The transhydrogenase genes were removed from pDC21 by double digestion with BamHI and HindIII and ligated with pTZ18U digested with BamHI and HindIII. With this pTZ18U plasmid, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to convert βAsp-213 to Asn or Ile, using the reagents and protocol as outlined in the Bio-Rad Muta-Gene Mutagenesis Kit (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was prepared from individual colonies, and the mutants were identified by double-strand DNA sequencing (2Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA (NY). 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). After confirming the DNA sequence, each Tth111I-BssHII 450-base pair DNA fragment was excised and replaced with the counterpart of pDC21. Transhydrogenation from NADPH to AcPyAD was assayed spectrophotometrically at 375 nm at 37°C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.01% Brij 35, 10 μg of lysophosphatidylcholine, and 0.5 mM each of NADPH and AcPyAD. An extinction coefficient of 6.1 mM-1 cm-1 was used to calculate the rates. Transhydrogenation from NADH to AcPyAD in the presence of NADP or NADPH was measured spectrophotometrically at 375 nm at 37°C in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM MES/KOH (pH 6.0), 10 μg of lysophosphatidylcholine, 0.2 mM NADP or NADPH, and 0.2 mM AcPyAD. The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μM NADH. Protein concentration was measured by the method of 22Peterson G.L. Anal.

One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of AcPyAD reduced by NADPH per min. 9-Aminoacridine fluorescence was measured at 37°C by an SLM photon-counting fluorescence spectrophotometer at the excitation wavelength of 420 nm and the emission wavelength of 500 nm. To the reaction mixture (2.0 ml), containing 10 mM Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), 2.5 mM MgSO4, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM EDTA, were added 20 μg of liposome-reconstituted transhydrogenase and 1 μM 9-aminoacridine followed by 0.2 mM NADPH. Then, 0.4 mM AcPyAD and 1 μM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone were added as indicated, and the fluorescence changes were monitored at 500 nm. E. coli strain MC4100 TH¯ was transformed with pDC21 or its mutated plasmids. Each single colony was inoculated into the LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown until the late logarithmic phase, collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min (Sorvall GSA rotor), and washed with 0.9% NaCl. The cells (wet weight, 14 g) were then suspended in 140 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), containing 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (TED), and sonicated in a Branson sonifier at output 8 and 25% pulse for 10 min. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 45 min (Beckman 42Ti rotor). Membranes were suspended in a small volume of TED and homogenized. E. coli membranes (30 mg of protein) were suspended in 6 ml of TED, and 1.5 ml of 10% Triton X-100 was slowly added. After stirring for 15 min at room temperature, the sample was centrifuged at 48,000 rpm (Beckman 50Ti rotor) for 45 min. The supernatant (15 ml) was directly loaded on a DEAE Bio-Gel A agarose column (1.5 × 14 cm) equilibrated with TED, containing 0.125 M NaCl and 0.02% potassium cholate. The enzyme was eluted by a linear NaCl concentration gradient from 0.125 M to 0.5 M in TED, containing 0.02% potassium cholate. Approximately 1-ml fractions were collected. The active fractions eluted at 0.20 M to 0.23 M NaCl were combined and concentrated to 1.0 ml by a Centricon-30 concentrator and loaded on an Ultrogel AcA34 column (1.5 × 68 cm) equilibrated with TED, containing 0.02% potassium cholate. Active fractions were combined (10 ml) and concentrated to ~700 μl by a Centricon-30 concentrator. Essentially the protocol developed by 31Sone N. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biochem.

Asolectin (200 mg) and cholic acid (150 mg) were added to 10 ml of 10 mM Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), containing 5 mM dithiothreitol and 0.2 mM EDTA. After adjustment of pH to 8.0 with 1 M KOH, the mixture was sonicated to clarity. The purified enzyme (100 μg of protein) was added to 2 ml of the asolectin suspension, and the mixture was dialyzed against 1 liter of 10 mM Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), containing 2.5 mM MgSO4, 0.25 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM EDTA for 20 h. [4-3H]NADP was prepared by phosphorylation of [4-3H]NAD (1200 mCi/mmol) in the presence of ATP and NAD kinase essentially according to 36Wang T.P. Kaplan N.O. Stolzenbach F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 211: 465-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. [4-3H]NAD and [4-3H]NADP were separated on a Dowex 1 formate (200-400 mesh) column (0.7 × 6 cm). [4-3H]NAD was eluted with 0.6 M formic acid, and [4-3H]NADP was eluted with 1.2 M formic acid (Hatefi et al., 1980). The contents of the tubes containing [4-3H]NADP were combined and lyophilized. [4-3H]NADP was reduced in 0.5 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 4 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mMD-isocitrate, and 120 μg of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The solution was incubated at room temperature and monitored spectrophotometrically for NADP reduction. After completion of the reaction (A260/A340 = 2.3), the solution was heated in a boiling water bath for 2 min to inactivate and precipitate the enzyme. The resulting supernatant obtained after centrifugation was calibrated spectrophotometrically for [4-3H]NADPH concentration and then used for binding studies. The extinction coefficient used for determining the concentration of NADPH was 6.22 mM-1 cm-1 at 340 nm. The centrifugation method of 13Howlett G.J. Yeh E. Schachman H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 190: 809-819Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar was followed for analyzing the binding of nucleotides to peptides. Proteins were mixed with different fixed concentrations of [3H]NADPH in 110 μl of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), containing 0.5 mM dithiothreitol and 0.02% potassium cholate. Dextran T40 (2 mg/ml) was also added to provide density stabilization and prevent convective stirring of the tube contents during deceleration of the rotor. Samples were centrifuged at room temperature in a Beckman Airfuge at 30 p.s.i. Ten μl of the top layer before and after centrifugation was assayed for radioactivity, and the values were used to calculate total and free ligand concentrations, respectively. The difference in the concentration of radioactive ligand between the original solution and the supernatant after centrifugation was a direct measure of the amount of bound ligand. The data were treated according to the Scatchard equation for equilibrium binding (29Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975: 218-220Google Scholar) as before (Yamaguchi and Hatefi, 1993). Enzyme samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 63 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue, and subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. Free carboxyl groups in the membrane-intercalating domains of proton-translocating enzymes are generally considered as good candidates for participation in transmembrane proton translocation, witness Asp-85 and Asp-96 of bacteriorhodopsin (26Rothschild K.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 147-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and Asp-61 of subunit c of E. coli ATP synthase complex or the corresponding Glu in ATP synthases from other species (5Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, there is in the 400-residue-long hydrophobic domain of the transhydrogenase subunits a single conserved aspartic acid residue (E. coli βAsp-213), which is located in a 58-residue-long segment of high sequence identity among the 5 sequenced transhydrogenases from diverse sources (Fig. 1). This 58-residue-long segment immediately precedes the extramembranous NADP(H) binding domain, and, for the reasons mentioned in the introduction, makes it a possible candidate for involvement in energy transduction and the enzyme's proton channel. Hence, it was of interest to investigate the role of the E. coli transhydrogenase βAsp-213 in transhydrogenation and proton translocation by site-directed mutagenesis. For this purpose, it was considered important to express the mutated forms of the enzyme in a strain of E. coli from which the wild-type transhydrogenase genes had been deleted (TH¯), so that no background wild-type activity, no matter how small, would complicate the interpretation of results. This was done as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the deletion of transhydrogenase genes was confirmed by Southern blotting. Then, in this strain were expressed the wild-type enzyme as well as two mutants in which βAsp-213 was mutated to Asn (βD213N) and Ile (βD213I). Fig. 2 shows the transhydrogenase activities of E. coli membranes containing the expressed wild-type (A) and the βD213N (B) and βD213I (C) mutants. The transhydrogenase activity of membranes from the TH¯ strain (D) is also shown. The minimal activity seen in trace D is probably due to another membrane-bound protein. Mutation of βAsp-213 to Asn and Ile resulted, respectively, in a 72% and 91% loss of transhydrogenase activity (see Fig. 2 legend). These data indicated that, even though βAsp-213 does not appear to be an essential residue, its mutation (especially to Ile) results, nevertheless, in a dramatic loss of transhydrogenase activity. For further characterization of the mutants, all three expressed enzymes were purified from the E. coli membranes (Fig. 3).3 3The identical purification procedures of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes suggest that no major structural alteration had taken place as a result of βD213N and βD213I mutations. The purified enzymes were then incorporated into liposomes and assayed for transhydrogenation-coupled proton translocation. As seen in Fig. 4, they were all capable of proton translocation upon initiation of NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation, and it was apparent that the proton translocation capability of the βD213I mutant was less than those of the wild-type and the βD213N mutant enzymes. The initial rates of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching upon initiation of the reaction by addition of AcPyAD indicated that the rates of proton translocation by the βD213N and the βD213I mutant enzymes were, respectively, ~25% and ~9% of the proton translocation rate of the wild-type enzyme. These values agreed well with the relative transhydrogenation activities of the purified enzymes as given in the legend to Fig. 3. A more interesting difference between the wild-type and mutant transhydrogenases was, however, the effect the mutation of βAsp-213 had on the apparent Km values of the substrates. As seen in, the apparent Km values for NADPH and AcPyAD, as determined from Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots, were diminished in the mutant enzymes. This change was particularly noteworthy for the apparent KmNADPH of the βD213I mutant, which had decreased by about 3.5-fold as compared to that of the wild-type transhydrogenase.Figure 3:SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns of purified wild-type and mutant transhydrogenases.

Hence, direct binding studies were done with the purified wild-type and the βD213I mutant enzymes, using [3H]NADPH. Binding studies with the βD213N mutant and with AcPyAD were not done, because the Km changes were not large enough to be reliably checked by equilibrium binding studies. The results of equilibrium binding of [3H]NADPH to the purified wild-type (A) and the βD213I mutant (B) transhydrogenases are shown in the Scatchard plots of Fig. 5. The KdNADPH values derived from these plots were 19.7 μM for the wild-type transhydrogenase and 6.0 μM for the βD213I mutant enzyme. It may be noted that in Fig. 5 the abscissa intercepts (moles of [3H]NADPH bound per mol of dimeric transhydrogenase) were n = 0.78 in panel A and n = 0.65 in panel B. Ideally, these values should be close to 1.0 for a dimeric, half-of-the-sites reactive enzyme. For the bovine transhydrogenase, we estimated n values of 1.02 for NADH and 0.92 for NADPH (Yamaguchi and Hatefi, 1993). However, we have noticed that the purified E. coli transhydrogenase has a greater tendency to aggregate at the concentrations used for binding studies than the purified bovine enzyme. We, therefore, repeated the experiments of Fig. 5 in the presence of different low concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholine, which increase transhydrogenase activity when added to the assay mixture, but there was no improvement in the values of n. The energy-transducing transhydrogenases of mitochondria and bacteria do not catalyze transhydrogenation from NADH to NAD or AcPyAD, but they do catalyze a slow transhydrogenation from NADPH to NADP or AcPyADP, which was shown in bovine submitochondrial particles to be energy-linked and accelerated by membrane energization (10Hatefi Y. Phelps D.C. Galante Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9526-9529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 25Phelps D.C. Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9647-9652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, Fisher and co-workers (38Wu L.N.Y. Earle S.R. Fisher R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7401-7408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that in reconstituted proteoliposomes, where the normal NADPH → NAD transhydrogenation becomes inhibited in the absence of an uncoupler to dissipate the membrane potential, the enzyme does catalyze a rapid and stoichiometric NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation, which requires NADP(H) and is not coupled to proton translocation. Furthermore, they showed that whereas the stereospecificity of hydride ion transfer in the energy-transducing reaction is [4A]NAD(H) ⇄ [4B]NADP(H), in the NADP(H)-dependent NADH → NAD (or AcPyAD) reaction it is 4A → 4A (Wu et al., 1981). A possible explanation offered was that creation of a membrane potential in proteoliposomes prevents the release of enzyme-bound NADP, which accepts a hydride ion equivalent from NADH. Then, the NAD so formed goes off the enzyme and is replaced by AcPyAD, which is reduced by the enzyme-bound NADPH (Wu et al., 1981; 6Fisher R.R. Earle S.R. Everse J. Anderson B. You K.-S. The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes. Academic Press, New York1982: 279-324Crossref Google Scholar). 14Hutton M. Day J.M. Bizouarn T. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar have shown recently that this cyclic NADP(H)-dependent NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation can also be observed at pH 6.0 and low ionic strength with the detergent-solubilized enzyme not incorporated in liposomes, apparently because the enzyme-NADP(H) complex is much more stable under these conditions. In principle, therefore, the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation catalyzed via an enzyme-bound NADP(H) would be analogous to the [4B]NAD(H) ⇄ [4B]NADP(H) transhydrogenation catalyzed by the so-called BB transhydrogenases. These enzymes are soluble flavoproteins in which the enzyme-bound flavin carries out the act of transferring a hydride ion equivalent from one nicotinamide dinucleotide to another as they bind interchangeably at the same site (27Rydström J. Persson B. Carlenor E. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. Academic Press, New York1987: 433-460Google Scholar; 20Lee C.-P. Ernster L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1000: 371-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cyclic transhydrogenase reaction was of interest to us, because it appeared to test the functionality of the catalytic sector of the enzyme without the constraints that an impaired proton channel might exert on the normal NADPH → NAD transhydrogenation reaction. In other words, we could ask whether the inhibited βD213I mutant was capable of catalyzing the NADP(H)-dependent NADH → AcPyAD cyclic transhydrogenation reaction. As seen in Fig. 6A, the purified βD213I mutant catalyzed a rapid cyclic transhydrogenation reaction upon successive additions of 20 μM NADH to a reaction mixture containing 0.2 mM each of NADPH and AcPyAD (see also 7Glavas N.A. Structural and Functional Studies of the Pyridine Nucleotide Transhydrogenase of the Escherichia coli, Ph.D. dissertation, University of British Columbia. 1994; Google Scholar). For comparison, the cyclic transhydrogenation reaction catalyzed by the purified, wild-type enzyme is also shown (Fig. 6B). The data of, derived from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots, show that the rates of the cyclic transhydrogenation reactions catalyzed by the purified βD213N and βD213I mutated enzymes were somewhat slower at Vmax than that catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. However, comparison of the data of Table I:, Table II: clearly indicate that, relative to the rates of the wild-type enzyme, the energy-transducing NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenase activity of the βD213I mutant enzyme was inhibited much more than its cyclic NADH → AcPyAD reaction, which is not coupled to proton translocation. An obvious conclusion, therefore, is that the mutation of βAsp-213 to Ile interferes with the proton translocation capability of the E. coli transhydrogenase, thereby inhibiting the coupled NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation much more than the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD reaction. also shows that in the cyclic transhydrogenase reaction the apparent S (the concentration needed for half-maximal activity) of NADPH decreased in the mutated enzymes and that in the βD213I mutant it is one order of magnitude smaller than in the wild-type enzyme. These results are in agreement with the apparent K mNADPH data of and the K dNADPH values derived from the equilibrium binding experiments of Fig. 5. Together, they suggest that mutations of βAsp-213 to Asn and especially to Ile in the hydrophobic, membrane-intercalating domain of the enzyme are communicated to the NADP(H) binding site, altering the enzyme's affinity for NADPH. The implications of these results on the mechanism of energy transduction by the transhydrogenase enzyme are discussed below.Table I:Kinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant enzymes for the NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation reaction Open table in a new tab Table II:Effect of NADPH concentration on the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation catalyzed by the purified wild-type and mutant enzymes Open table in a new tab It has been shown here that the mutation in E. coli of the only conserved dicarboxylic acid residue in the hydrophobic domain of the β subunit of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (βAsp-213) to Asn (βD213N) or Ile (βD213I) diminishes in parallel the hydride ion transfer (NADPH → AcPyAD) and the transmembrane proton translocation activities of the enzyme. In the case of the βD213I mutant, these activities, as assayed with the purified and liposome-reconstituted enzymes, were 90% lower than the activities of the wild-type transhydrogenase. However, another activity of the βD213I mutant, namely, the NADP(H)-dependent cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation, which is not coupled to proton translocation, was only about 35% inhibited. As seen in Fig. 1, βAsp-213 is located in a hydrophobic stretch of 58 highly conserved amino acid residues, which is immediately adjacent to the COOH-terminal extramembranous domain of the β subunit that binds NADP(H). In the hydrophobic domain of the β subunit, there is a second, much shorter stretch (19 residues) of high sequence conservation (Fig. 1). This segment contains a conserved His (βHis-91) whose mutation to Ser, Thr, or Cys also results in ≥90% loss of NADPH → AcPyAD hydride ion transfer and coupled proton translocation activities (Holmberg et al., 1994). Because such regions of high sequence identity are rare in the hydrophobic domains of functionally related proteins, it is possible that in the folded structure of the transhydrogenase these regions of high sequence identity are in close apposition and are together involved as membrane-intercalated helices in the proton translocation function of the enzyme. Whether βHis-91 and βAsp-213 are within these membrane-intercalated helices or in the extramembranous loops that connect the helices is not known. Nor do the catalytic properties of the mutant enzymes cited above indicate whether these amino acid residues play a chemical or a structural role in the coupled reactions of the transhydrogenase. Such distinctions are difficult to make, especially when one considers the recent results of 30Sonar S. Marti T. Rath P. Fischer W. Coleman M. Nilsson A. Khorana H.G. Rothschild K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28851-28858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar on bacteriorhodopsin. These authors have shown that in a Y57D mutant of bacteriorhodopsin the deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and formation of the M intermediate is blocked. Nevertheless, the Y57D mutant is capable of appreciable proton translocation activity, apparently via a redirected proton pathway. Therefore, in the E. coli transhydrogenase, the incomplete loss of proton translocation activity upon mutations of βHis-91 and βAsp-213 does not necessarily mean that one or both of these residues are not directly involved in proton translocation in the wild-type enzyme. It has also been shown here that, in addition to 90% inhibition of NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation and coupled proton translocation activities, the βD213I mutation lowers the apparent K mNADPH by 3.5-fold in the above reaction (assayed at pH 7.0) and by 10-fold in the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation reaction (assayed at pH 6.0 and low ionic strength). In agreement with these results, it was shown by equilibrium binding experiments (at pH 7.0) that in the βD213I mutant enzyme K dNADPH is ≥3-fold lower than in the wild-type transhydrogenase. These results indicate, therefore, that βAsp-213 or a mutation of this residue influences the affinity of the nearby NADP(H) binding site for its substrate. We have discussed elsewhere that the energetically uphill (inside-to-outside) proton translocation that is coupled to NADPH → NAD transhydrogenation (reversal of Equation 1) is driven by the difference in the binding energies of the reactants (NADPH and NAD) and the products (NADP and NADH). This means that the enzyme must undergo a conformation change coupled to hydride ion transfer from NADPH to NAD. Because substrate binding by the bovine transhydrogenase is random, we were able to show that the bindings of NADPH and NADP, but not of NADH and NAD, change the conformation of the enzyme in different ways. We, therefore, proposed that the difference in the binding energies of NADPH and NADP is the principal force that via coupled conformation changes of the protein results in vectorial proton release and uptake across the membrane (for elegant discussions of the utilization of binding energy to drive coupled vectorial processes, including proton translocation, see 15Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 219-410PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jencks W.P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 145-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Accordingly, if we now assume that the hydrophobic stretches of high sequence identity depicted in Fig. 1 are involved in the coupled conformation changes of the transhydrogenase, we could then rationalize why a point mutation in these hydrophobic stretches might alter the affinity of the enzyme for NADPH. In other words, it is possible that the βD213I mutation causes a structural change in the hydrophobic domain of the β subunit that has a reciprocal effect on the binding energy of NADPH. This structural change could restrict proton translocation and inhibit the coupled transhydrogenation reaction. Another finding of interest, especially in the case of the βD213I mutation, is that the enzyme's cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenase activity is much less inhibited than its normal, energy-coupled NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation reaction. The inhibition of the latter reaction, as discussed above, is consistent with the possibility that the βD213I mutation restricts proton translocation and as a consequence inhibits the coupled NADPH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation. However, this does not explain why the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD reaction should not be equally inhibited as well. The explanation, we feel, lies in the difference between the normal and the cyclic transhydrogenation reactions, more precisely between the role of NADP(H) in each. In the energy-coupled NADPH → NAD transhydrogenation reaction, enzyme-bound NADPH and NADP are in equilibrium with their counterparts in the medium. As a result, the enzyme experiences their different binding energies with each turnover and undergoes the conformation changes that drive proton translocation. By contrast, the cyclic NADH → NAD transhydrogenation occurs while NADP(H) is enzyme-bound. Hence, the enzyme does not experience the different binding energies of NADPH and NADP and does not undergo the conformation changes that drive proton translocation. This important difference can, therefore, explain why the cyclic NADH → AcPyAD transhydrogenation is not coupled to proton translocation and why restriction of the latter process by the βD213I mutation does not have a comparable inhibitory effect on the cyclic transhydrogenation reaction. The apparent Km and Vmax values were derived from Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. The apparent S (NADPH concentration required for half-maximal activity) and Vmax values were derived from Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. We thank Drs.

In general, these receptors activate transcription in response to endocrine and metabolic stimuli by binding to DNA elements found in the promoters of specific genes. For most receptors studied to date the core DNA recognition element is AGNNCA(4Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the glucocorticoid receptor and the estrogen receptor has shown that the DNA binding domain consists of two interdependent zinc finger-like motifs with an amphipathic α-helix at the C-terminal region of each finger(5Luisi B.F.

The α-helix following the second finger folds over the DNA recognition α-helix to stabilize the structure through hydrophobic interactions and provides phosphate contacts to the DNA backbone.While it is likely that most receptors utilize these conserved functions, individual receptors bind to, and activate transcription from, distinct DNA sequences(4Glass C.K.

Discrimination between DNA binding sites by the various receptors occurs at three levels: 1) nucleotide preference of the third and fourth base pairs of the core DNA element (9-11); 2) flanking sequence preferences upstream and possibly downstream of the core DNA element(12Wilson T.E.

Crystal structures and mutagenesis studies have indicated that recognition of the third and fourth base pairs of the hexameric half-site are largely determined by the identity of three amino acids within the DNA recognition α-helix referred to as the “P-box” (Fig. 1). The glucocorticoid receptor contains a GSV P-box amino acid sequence and binds with the highest affinity to an inverted repeat with AGAACA half-site sequences. The valine forms a specific interaction with the fourth base pair of this sequence (5). In contrast, the estrogen receptor which has an EGA P-box sequence, binds with the highest affinity to an AGGTCA half-site because of specific interactions formed between the glutamate and the central base pairs of this half-site(8Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The third P-box amino acid in the estrogen receptor, unlike its counterpart in the glucocorticoid receptor, does not contact any nucleotides. However, mutational studies of the estrogen receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, and v-erbA oncogene have shown that substitution of the third P-box amino acid has profound effects on the sequence specific binding of these receptors to DNA(20Truss M.

Hendy S.C. Faris J.S. Romaniuk P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 829-840PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor is able to interact with DNA elements that consist of two AGGNCA half-sites oriented as a direct repeat, inverted repeat, or everted repeat (Fig. 1). The results of studying this small sample of P-box variants suggested that each amino acid in the P-box functions within the context of the entire P-box sequence such that substitution of an amino acid at one position may alter the functionality of an amino acid at one of the other positions.In the present study, we have tested the contextual nature of P-box function in hT3Rβ in greater detail. A total of 57 variant hT3Rβ receptors incorporating all possible amino acids at each of the three P-box positions were constructed. The effects of these variant P-box sequences on the DNA sequence specificity of the receptors was investigated using a panel of 16 everted repeat elements which differ in sequence at the central base pairs of the hexameric half-site. The results of this study demonstrate that all three P-box amino acids in hT3Rβ function to discriminate the nucleotide sequence of the third and fourth base pairs of the half-sites in everted repeats. Several of the variant receptors have a DNA binding specificity distinct from the wild type receptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction and Expression of hT3Rβ MutantsP-box amino acid substitution mutants of hT3Rβ were created by a site-directed mutagenesis strategy described previously(23Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Faris J.S. Romaniuk P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 829-840PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was used to verify that only the desired mutation was introduced into the hT3Rβ cDNA. Proteins were prepared by in vitro transcription/translation using a T7 RNA polymerase coupled-rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Promega) and DNA templates that had been linearized at a HindIII site downstream of the hT3Rβ cDNA. Protein yield in each reaction was quantified by monitoring the conversion of 35S-labeled methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitated form, and by verifying the production of full-length receptor by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Translated proteins were diluted to identical concentrations using unprogrammed lysate and stored frozen at −70°C in 3-μl aliquots.Construction of Mutant TREsA series of complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized with the core sequence of the upper strand being TGACCTctgcagAGGTCA flanked by HindIII compatible overhangs. In the complete series of everted repeat elements, the nucleotide positions in bold in the AGGTCA half-site on each strand were replaced with GA, GG, GC, AT, AA, AG, AC, CT, CA, CG, CC, TT, TA, TG, or TC. Each everted repeat was cloned into the HindIII site of pUC19. DNA fragments containing the everted repeats were excised from pUC19 by digestion with HindIII, labeled with 32P, and purified by gel electrophoresis as described previously(23Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 829-840PubMed Google Scholar).DNA Binding AnalysisAliquots of in vitro translated proteins (3 μl) were preincubated on ice for 10 min in a 10-μl volume containing 50 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia). Labeled DNA (10,000 cpm, about 2 fmol) in a 2-μl volume was added and incubation was continued on ice for another 10 min. Under these conditions, the wild type hT3Rβ protein bound approximately 20-30% of the labeled DNA when the everted repeat element had the wild type AGGTCA half-site sequences flanked by 5′-CAG(23Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Faris J.S. Romaniuk P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 829-840PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of mutant receptors with less than 1% of the activity of the wild type receptor could be detected under these binding conditions when the time for autoradiography was extended from 16 to 96 h(24Nelson C.C. Faris J.S. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1185-1195PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel (55:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 0.3 × TBE and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Gels were run for 2 h at 15 volts/cm at approximately 15°C in 0.3 × TBE. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70°C using Kodak X-AR film. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three times using different preparations of protein.RESULTSThe role of P-box amino acids in determining the unique DNA binding specificity of hT3Rβ was investigated by creating 19-amino acid substitution mutants at each of the three P-box positions (Fig. 1A). These mutants in conjunction with the wild type receptor were then assayed for DNA binding specificity using 16 different everted repeat elements that varied in the identity of the third and fourth base pairs of the hexameric half-site. The everted configuration of half-sites was chosen because hT3Rβ homodimers have a high DNA binding affinity for this orientation and spacing of half-sites (16Näär A.M. Boutin J.M. Lipkin S.M.

The results of the gel shift analysis demonstrated that binding of hT3Rβ receptors to these four DNA elements was largely restricted to those containing the wild type EGG P-box, with varying degrees of binding observed for the mutant receptor with a DGG P-box depending upon the identity of the fourth nucleotide of the half-site (Fig. 2). On the element with AGGTCA half-sites, the receptor with a EGG P-box bound with the highest affinity, the receptor with the DGG P-box bound with lower affinity, and there was faint, but detectable binding by the mutant receptor with a NGG P-box. Receptor binding on the element containing AGGACA half-sites demonstrated that the EGG P-box directs high affinity binding, while the DGG P-box directs very low affinity binding. On AGGGCA and AGGCCA half-sites, the wild type receptor with an EGG P-box bound with a slightly higher affinity than the mutant receptor with the DGG P-box. Thus the ratio of the affinities of these two receptors on these two elements is distinctly different from the relative binding affinities of these proteins on the elements with AGGTCA and AGGACA half-sites, where EGG was strongly preferred over DGG.Figure 2:Gel mobility shift analysis of amino acid substitution mutants in the first P-box position of hT3Rβ.

This difference in receptor binding affinity between the four elements is not apparent in Fig. 2 because autoradiographic exposure times were adjusted to identify the P-box variants of hT3Rβ that would bind to a particular DNA element. DNA binding affinity for this set of P-box variants was highest for the consensus AGGTCA half-sites, weaker for AGGACA half-sites, and considerably weaker for AGGCCA and AGGGCA half-sites.Effects of Amino Acid Substitutions at the Second P-box Position on the Interaction of hT3Rβ with TREs Containing AGGNCA Half-sitesThe effects of amino acid substitutions at the second P-box position of hT3Rβ were tested using everted repeats with AGGNCA half-sites (Fig. 3). On AGGTCA half-sites, DNA binding was observed for the wild type hT3Rβ (EGG P-box) and the mutant receptor with an EAG P-box. A minimal amount of binding to this element was also observed for the mutant receptor with an ESG P-box. On everted repeats with either AGGGCA or AGGCCA half-sites, only those receptors with EGG and EAG P-box sequences were able to bind with high affinity. The everted repeat consisting of AGGACA half-sites was able to bind a greater variety of mutant hT3Rβ receptors: in addition to receptors with EGG and EAG P-box sequences, mutant receptors with ESG and EPG P-box sequences also bound to this element. It is interesting to note that the mutant receptor with an EAG P-box sequence bound with a substantially higher affinity than the wild type receptor with the EGG P-box to the AGGACA half-sites, whereas these two receptors had roughly equal affinity for binding to the other three half-site sequences in this series (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Gel mobility shift analysis of amino acid substitution mutants in the second P-box position of hT3Rβ. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed by gel mobility shift analysis on DNA elements composed of everted half-sites of the sequence AGGNCA, where N was T, A, G, or C as indicated.

Mutant hT3Rβ receptors with EGA, EGV, EGL, EGM, EGG, EGS, and EGT P-box sequences bound with the highest affinities to the element with AGGTCA half-sites. The mutant receptor with an EGC P-box bound to this everted repeat with a strong affinity both as a monomer and a dimer. In comparison, receptors with EGI, EGN, and EGQ P-box sequences bound to the AGGTCA element with a somewhat lower affinity and binding of the mutant receptor with the EGK P-box had the lowest affinity. The binding of this panel of hT3Rβ receptors to the everted repeat with AGGACA half-sites differed significantly: only the wild type receptor with an EGG P-box had a strong affinity for this element, while mutant receptors with the P-box sequences EGA, EGV, EGL, EGI, EGM, EGT, and EGN bound with very low affinities. A third distinct pattern of binding was observed for the everted repeat with AGGGCA half-sites. Receptors with the highest affinities for this element had EGI and EGT P-box sequences. Strong binding was also observed for mutant receptors with EGA, EGM, EGS, and EGK P-box sequences. In comparison, mutant receptors with the P-box sequences EGV and EGY bound with reduced affinity to the everted repeat with AGGGCA half-sites and there was barely detectable binding observed for the receptors with EGL, EGF, EGG, and EGN P-box sequences. On the element containing AGGCCA half-sites the highest binding affinity was observed for those mutant receptors with EGN, EGQ, and EGK P-box sequences, whereas a lower binding affinity was observed for those receptors with EGA, EGG, and EGS P-box sequences. Weak DNA binding was detected on this element for mutant receptors with EGI, EGM, and EGT P-box sequences.Figure 4:Gel mobility shift analysis of amino acid substitution mutants in the third P-box position of hT3Rβ. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed by gel mobility shift analysis on DNA elements composed of everted half-sites of the sequence AGGNCA, where N was T, A, G, or C as indicated. The P-box amino acid sequence of the receptor protein is indicated by the amino acid one letter code, with the amino acid in bold being analyzed. Shown are strips of the autoradiographs containing the monomer-DNA complexes (M) and the homodimer-DNA complexes (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Some P-box Substitution Mutants Also Bind to AGTNCA Half-sitesSome of the P-box variants of hT3Rβ were able to bind to elements with half-sites that had a thymidine in the third nucleotide position (AGTNCA). Receptor binding on the everted repeat with AGTTCA half-sites demonstrated a unique pattern of amino acid compatibility at all three P-box positions (Fig. 5). On this element amino acid variants in the first P-box position of hT3Rβ that retained strong DNA binding affinity included NGG, DGG, and EGG; detectable DNA binding was observed for receptors with P-box sequences of AGG, GGG, and SGG. With the exception of the wild type EGG P-box, none of the mutant receptors with an amino acid substitution at the second P-box position were able to bind to the AGTTCA half-sites. Of the substitution mutations at the third P-box position, the highest DNA binding affinities were achieved by receptors with EGQ and EGA P-box sequences, while those receptors with EGL, EGG, EGS, and EGN P-box sequences bound to this element with lower affinities. It is interesting to note that the AGTTCA half-site sequence is commonly found in naturally occurring retinoic acid and vitamin D3 response elements, and that the corresponding receptors have a higher affinity for this motif than AGGTCA half-sites.Figure 5:P-box mutants of hT3Rβ were analyzed for DNA binding on AGTTCA half-sites. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed by gel mobility shift analyses on an everted repeat of AGTTCA half-sites. The position of the P-box substitution is indicated at the left-hand column by the letter “X,” with the identity of X being shown in the top row by the amino acid one letter code. Shown are autoradiograph strips of the homodimer-DNA complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The everted repeat with AGTACA half-sites had a very weak affinity for the DGG P-box variant receptor, and even less affinity for mutant receptors with NGG, EAG, and EGA P-box sequences. The wild type hT3Rβ receptor with a EGG P-box did not bind to this element. On an everted repeat with AGTGCA half-sites, very weak binding was observed for receptors with EGG, DGG, and NGG P-box sequences, and barely detectable binding was observed for receptors with EGA and EGS P-box sequences (data not shown).Perhaps the most intriguing results were obtained using the everted repeat with AGTCCA half-sites. Binding of hT3Rβ variant receptors to this element demonstrated a clear “change in specificity.” In particular, the wild type receptor was unable to bind to this everted repeat, while several mutant receptors bound with high affinity (Fig. 6). Of the variant receptors with an amino acid substitution in the first P-box position, the receptor with a DGG P-box bound to the AGTCCA everted repeat with highest affinity. Strong DNA binding affinity was also observed for the receptor with an NGG P-box and lower binding affinities were observed for the receptors with AGG, LGG, PGG, GGG, SGG, and VGG P-box sequences. The incompatibility of a glutamate in the first P-box position of hT3Rβ with binding to AGTCCA half-sites could not be overcome by any amino acid substitution in the second P-box position. However, amino acid substitution in the third P-box position of hT3Rβ resulted in high affinity binding to the everted repeat with AGTCCA half-sites by the receptor with a EGQ P-box sequence and barely detectable binding of receptors with EGA and EGS P-box sequences. The effect of the glutamine for glycine substitution in the third P-box position is somewhat different for the binding of the receptor to everted repeats that have only the thymidine substitution in the third nucleotide of the half-site (AGTTCA; Fig. 5) or only the cytidine substitution in the fourth nucleotide of the half-site (AGGCCA; Fig. 4). In each of these cases, the presence of a glutamine in the third P-box position (EGQ) provides an increase in DNA binding affinity in comparison to the wild type receptor (EGG) which has a reasonable affinity for these two elements. However, as the data in Fig. 6 show, if the half-sites of the everted repeat contain both of these nucleotide substitutions (AGTCCA) the receptor with the EGQ P-box sequence binds with high affinity whereas the wild type receptor is unable to bind at all.Figure 6:P-box mutants of hT3Rβ were analyzed for DNA binding on AGTCCA half-sites. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed by gel mobility shift analyses on an everted repeat of AGTCCA half-sites. The position of the P-box substitution is indicated at the left-hand column by the letter “X,” with the identity of X being shown in the top row by the amino acid one letter code. Shown are autoradiograph strips of the homodimer-DNA complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Adenine or Cytosine in the Third Nucleotide of the TRE Half-site Sequence Block Receptor BindingNo binding was detected for either wild type hT3Rβ or the 57 P-box variant receptors on the eight DNA elements that had either an adenosine (AGANCA) or cytidine (AGCNCA) in the third nucleotide position of the half-site (data not shown). This result indicates that there is a strict requirement for a guanosine or thymidine in the third nucleotide position of the TRE half-site for binding of this series of related receptors. The simplest explanations for this observation would be that either a critical contact is formed between the receptor and the AGGNCA and AGTNCA half-sites that is lost when the other two nucleotides are substituted into the third position, or that substitution of an A or C at that position of the half-site sterically hinders the recognition α-helix of the receptor from interacting with the DNA. It seems likely that there are other P-box combinations in the complete set of 8000 possible P-box sequences that would interact with TREs containing AGANCA or AGCNCA half-site sequences.DISCUSSIONThe P-box amino acids of the nuclear receptor family play a crucial role in DNA binding site selection. This amino acid motif in the recognition α-helix of these proteins determines the two central base pairs of the hexameric half-site for a cognate receptor-DNA interaction(9Danielsen M. Hinck L.

https://openalex.org/W1537690122,"Evidence suggests that ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the clathrin-coated vesicle proton-translocating ATPase requires at least four polypeptides of molecular masses of 70, 58, 40, and 33 kDa (Xie, X.-S., and Stone, D. K.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9859-9867). To further investigate the subunit requirements for ATP hydrolysis, histidine-tagged, 58-kDa polypeptide was expressed in insect Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells. After purification by Ni2+-nitrolotriacetic acid chromatography, the 58-kDa protein was found to lack significant ATPase activity. However, the subunit was photoaffinity labeled with [α-32P]ATP, [14C]ADP, or 35S-labeled ADP and UV irradiation in a divalent cation-dependent manner. The labeling was saturable with an apparent Kd of 4 μM for both ATP and ADP. ATP and ADP competition labeling experiments indicate that the two nucleotides share the same binding site. When reconstituted with recombinant 70-kDa subunit and a biochemically prepared catalytic sector (Vc) depleted of the 70- and 58-kDa subunits, the 58-kDa component restores Ca2+-activated ATP hydrolysis to a specific activity of 0.19 μmol Pi× mg protein−1× min−1, thus demonstrating that ATP hydrolysis in vacuolar type proton pumps is dependent upon the 58-kDa subunit as well as multi-subunit interactions."

We have produced individual α and β subunits separately in Escherichia coli JM109 cells by recombinant DNA techniques.

The active species in isolated α and β samples were each the predominant protein species, corresponding to a 42,000 Mrα monomer and a 67,000 Mrβ dimer, respectively. These findings clearly indicate that the activities of the individual subunits are not due to trace contaminations of the respective counter subunits. The much reduced specific activities of the individual subunits are, in part, a consequence of diminished abilities to oxidize the aldehyde substrate. Kinetic and equilibrium measurements indicate that α and β2 each contained a reduced flavin site, an aldehyde substrate site, and an aldehyde inhibitor site. The on and off rates of the decanal inhibitor binding were substantially slower than the bindings of decanal and reduced riboflavin 5′-phosphate substrates.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12194-12201Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The specific functions of either subunit are, however, only poorly understood. An important claim has recently been made that individual subunits of Vibrio harveyi luciferase are active in catalyzing light emissions with their specific activities about 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the native dimeric enzyme(11Waddle J.J. Baldwin T.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The low activities notwithstanding, the abilities of α and β to catalyze the light emission have significant implications to our understanding of the structure of luciferase active site and functionalities of the individual subunits. However, such a claim was disputed by two later studies which report that neither the individual α (13Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J.M. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We believe that the question as to whether the individual α or β is catalytically active has a fundamental importance to our understanding of luciferase structure-function relationships. This work was initiated to resolve the apparent controversy and examine further the functionalities of the α and β subunits. We found that individual subunits are indeed active in bioluminescence. Moreover, the active subunit species have been characterized with respect to molecular weights, general catalytic and kinetic properties, sensitivities to chemical modification and proteolysis, flavin and aldehyde binding properties, stabilities of the flavin 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate, and abilities to consume the aldehyde substrate. Implications of these findings to the structure-function relationships of luciferase are discussed. Octanal, decanal, and dodecanal were purchased from Aldrich, and FMN was from Sigma. DEAE Sephadex A-50 and Sephadex G-150 were both products of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Ultro-Gel AcA 54 was obtained from Sepracor. A 2.53-kilobase fragment containing the complete luxA and luxB genes encoding the V. harveyi luciferase α and β subunits, respectively, was obtained from HindIII/KpnI digest of the recombinant phage MTX1(15Xi L. Cho K.W. Herndon M.E. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4200-4203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA fragment was inserted into pUC19 pretreated with the same restriction enzymes to produce the recombinant plasmid pMH2. pMH2 was digested with EcoRI to delete 1.26 kilobases for the destruction of the luxB, and was subsequently ligated to yield the plasmid pHC1 containing only the intact luxA. A luxB-containing 1.83-kilobase fragment was obtained from the KpnI/PstI digest of pMH2, and was inserted into pUC19 pretreated with the same restriction enzymes to generate the plasmid pHC2 containing only the complete luxB. Recombinant plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coli JM109, and clones were first screened for white colonies by α-complementation using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate and an inducer, respectively. Positive clones were further identified by restriction digestion patterns. Finally, E. coli JM109 cells harboring the desired pHC1 or pHC2 plasmid were first grown at 37°C overnight in 20 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg liter-1 of ampicillin. Four-ml aliquots were each inoculated into 1 liter of fresh medium for cell growth at 23°C for 48 h. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (0.2 mM) was added 4 h prior to harvest. All procedures were carried out at 2-4°C. The method of Waddle and Baldwin (11Waddle J.J. Baldwin T.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was followed for the purification of individual α and β subunits. For the former, the procedure was modified to apply 0.4 M Pi, pH 7.0, instead of a phosphate gradient for the DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography. Purities of the isolated α and β subunits were determined to be both ≥90% on the basis of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unless stated otherwise, 0.05 M Pi, pH 7.0, was used as a standard buffer. Bioluminescence was measured using either a calibrated home-made photometer or a Turner TD-20e luminometer. Several non-turnover assay methods were used to examine various kinetic parameters and the effects of ligand binding. These assays are designated by the method of flavin reduction and the condition of luciferase-substrate (or inhibitor) equilibration prior to the initiation of bioluminescence. In one series, FMN was reduced by Cu(I) (16, 17) for the Cu(I)-EAO and Cu(I)-EO assays(17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The former involves the injection of an FMNH2 solution into an aerobic buffer containing the enzyme sample and aldehyde to initiate the bioluminescence. The latter assay differs only by including the aldehyde in the FMNH2 solution rather than the aerobic enzyme solution. A standard dithionite assay(18Meighen E.A. Hastings J.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4310-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), now designated D-EF, was also used in which an aerobic aldehyde solution was injected into an anaerobic buffer containing enzyme and FMNH2. Last, for an alternative dithionite assay (designated D-EAO), a dithionite-reduced FMNH2 solution was injected into an aerobic buffer containing the enzyme and the aldehyde. Individual subunits and the native luciferase in 1 ml of 0.1 M Pi, pH 7.0, were each mixed with 50 μM FMN and a few milligrams of dithionite powder to reduce the flavin at 1°C. The solution was stirred gently until the free reduced flavin was reoxidized as indicated by the yellowing of the solution. At this point, the bound FMNH2 had also been converted to the FMN 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate. The sample was kept at 1°C and 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn after different times for the determination of the remaining quantities of the flavin 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate on the basis of the bioluminescence activities upon mixing with 1 ml of 0.05 M Pi, pH 7.0, containing saturating decanal at 23°C. The first-order decay rates of various flavin 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate species can be determined from semilogarithmic plots of remaining bioluminescence activities versus times of incubation at 1°C. Trypsin (0.5 mg) was added to 10 ml of 0.1 M Pi, pH 7.0, containing a designated level of α, β, or luciferase. Aliquots were withdrawn after different times of incubation at 23°C and the remaining bioluminescence activities were determined using the Cu(I)-EO assay. The apparent first-order rate constants for inactivation were determined by semilogarithmic plots of remaining activities versus times of proteolysis. Native luciferase and the individual α and β were each also treated with 0.2 mMN-ethylmaleimide at 23°C for inactivation by sulfhydryl group modification. Aliquots were withdrawn after different times and diluted into 1 ml of standard Pi buffer containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Remaining bioluminescence activities and the apparent first-order rate constants of inactivation were determined as described for trypsin digestion. Sephadex G-150 columns were equilibrated with 0.1 M Pi, pH 7.0, and calibrated with dextran blue, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, cytochrome c (monomer), and FMN for the construction of a molecular weight standard curve. The isolated α and β were each mixed with dextran blue and FMN in 1 ml of the standard buffer and applied to a calibrated column. Elutions were maintained at 15 ml h-1, and fractions were collected for the measurements of A280 and bioluminescence activities using the Cu(I)-EO assay. Partition coefficients were calculated for the A280 and activity peak fractions and the corresponding molecular weights were subsequently determined. The principle of Job analysis (20Job P. Ann. Chim. 1928; 9: 113-134Google Scholar) was applied to determine the number of aldehyde binding site by activity measurements. A series of samples were set up all containing a constant total concentration, at 1 μM, of a designated luciferase subunit species plus decanal in 1 ml of standard buffer but with the mole fraction of decanal varying from 0 to 1. Bioluminescence activities were measured by the D-EAO assay using a saturating level of FMNH2 as a cosubstrate, and were plotted against the mole fractions of decanal. The observed data were compared with theoretical plots for designated molar ratios of aldehyde binding by luciferase subunit. The stoichiometries of FMNH2 binding by luciferase subunits were determined under the same conditions except that the mole fractions of FMNH2 were varied and the activities were determined by the D-EF assay in the presence of a saturating level of decanal. The method of Hummel and Dreyer (21Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 532-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar) was followed. A 0.2-ml sample containing designated levels of an individual subunit and decanal in 0.02 M Pi, pH 7.0, was applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 3.5 cm) pre-equilibrated and eluted with the same decanal-containing buffer. Fractions (50 μl) were collected in tubes each containing 0.95 ml of ethanol. The amount of decanal in all fractions were determined by a method described previously(17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Designated levels of an individual subunit and decanal were mixed in the standard buffer and incubated for >3 min to allow the aldehyde binding to reach equilibrium. This solution was then diluted 5-fold with buffer. After a designated period of incubation, bioluminescence was initiated by the injection of 1 ml of buffer containing 0.5 mM decanal and 50 μM FMNH2 (reduced by the Cu(I) method). The time period of post-dilution incubation was lengthened gradually until no further change in bioluminescence activity was detected. To test the abilities of individual subunits to consume aldehyde, a limiting level of decanal (1 μM) was mixed with an excess amount of an individual subunit (8.3-9 μM) in 1 ml of standard buffer. An equal volume of buffer containing 50 μM FMNH2 (reduced by Cu(I)) was injected to initiate the light emission. After the cessation of bioluminescence, aliquots (20 μl) were taken for the determination of levels of the remaining aldehyde following a method detailed previously (22). The α and β subunits expressed from recombinant plasmids pHC1 and pHC2, respectively, and isolated as described above were both found to be active in catalyzing bioluminescence. Substrate titrations were carried out at 23°C using either decanal (in the Cu(I)-EO assay) or FMNH2 (in the D-EF assay) as the varying substrate, and values of Km and Vmax were determined by double reciprocal plots. The α was found to have a specific activity of 8.4 × 109 q s-1 mg-1 and a Km for FMNH2 of 0.15 μM, whereas the β was found to have a specific activity of 1.1 × 109 q s-1 mg-1 and a Km for FMNH2 of 0.58 μM. These values are similar to those reported earlier by Sinclair et al.(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, values of 0.9 and 2.0 μM were also determined as the Km for decanal for α and β, respectively, under conditions without any aldehyde inhibition (discussed in more detail later). The light decay rate (kdec) of the non-turnover reaction catalyzed by the native luciferase is quite sensitive to the type of aldehyde utilized. For α, kdec values of 0.052, 0.32, and 0.053 s-1 were detected for octanal, decanal, and dodecanal, respectively. In comparison, kdec values of 0.040, 0.29, and 0.043 s-1 were observed for octanal, decanal, and dodecanal, respectively, for β. Again, these values are quite close to those found by Sinclair et al.(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The general catalytic properties of α and β described thus far along with other kinetic properties to be detailed later are summarized in. The responses of the native luciferase and the individual subunits to activity perturbations by proteolysis and chemical modification were compared. Upon treatment by 50 μg ml-1 of trypsin in 0.1 M Pi, pH 7.0, apparent first-order inactivations of α, β, and the native luciferase were observed with the respective rate constants of 0.29, 0.15, and 0.62 min-1 (Fig. 1). The activities of both individual subunits were more resistant to trypsin digest than that of the native luciferase. The native luciferase is known to be quite sensitive to sulfhydryl modification as a means of inactivation. As a reference, an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.19 min-1 was observed for the inactivation of the native luciferase upon treatment with 0.2 mMN-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 2). Under identical treatment, the α showed an apparent first-order rate constant of 0.12 min-1 for inactivation and was slightly more stable than the native luciferase, whereas no significant activity loss was observed for β (Fig. 2). For the two subunits individually (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) and within the native luciferase(23Nicoli M.Z. Meighen E.A. Hastings J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2385-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Baldwin T.O. Hastings J.W. Riley P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5551-5554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the β appears to be more resistant to tryptic digest and sulfhydryl modification than the α.Figure 2:Inactivation of α, β, and native luciferase by sulfhydryl group modification. N-Ethylmaleimide was added at 0.2 mM to 1 ml of 0.1 M Pi, pH 7.0, containing 0.23 mg of α (■), 0.16 mg of β (▲), or 0.23 mg of native luciferase (●). After different times, 0.1-ml aliquots were withdrawn for the measurement of bioluminescence activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Flavin 4a-hydroperoxide, designated intermediate II, is a key luciferase intermediate which has been characterized extensively. Using the native luciferase as a reference, the flavin peroxide intermediate II was found to have a decay rate (kΣ) of 0.089 min-1 at 1°C (Fig. 3). In comparison, the flavin peroxide intermediates formed with the isolated α and β exhibited decay rates of 0.036 and 0.031 min-1, respectively, under identical conditions and were, hence, significantly more stable than that of the native luciferase (Fig. 3;). The isolated α and β subunits were each subject to Sephadex G-150 molecular sieve chromatography. For each subunit, only a single peak was observed when the fractions were tested for either A280 or bioluminescence activity. Moreover, the protein peak and the activity peak were comigrating during elution, indicating that for each individual subunit the predominant protein species was the catalytically active form. When compared with protein molecular weight standards, the catalytically active forms of α and β showed molecular weights of 42,000 and 67,000, respectively, indicating a monomeric form for α and a dimeric form for β. The native V. harveyi luciferase is sensitive to inhibition by high concentrations of aldehyde when luciferase is equilibrated with aldehyde prior to the binding of reduced flavin(25Hastings J.W. Weber K. Friedland J. Eberhard A. Mitchell G.W. Gunsalus A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4681-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 26Meighen E.A. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1482-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Aldehyde inhibitions of individual α and β under the same condition of aldehyde pre-equilibration have also been reported recently(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This claim has now been confirmed by our observations of effective inhibitions of α and β at ≥10-5M decanal in the Cu(I)-EAO assay (Fig. 4). In addition, we have used two other assay methods to examine the effects of ligand preincubation on the activities of individual subunits. At decanal concentrations up to 1.7 mM for α and 2 mM for β, no aldehyde inhibition was detected when either subunit was pre-equilibrated with FMNH2 prior to aldehyde addition as in the D-EF assay. Moreover, only slight inhibitions were observed for the two individual subunits when 1.7 to 2.0 mM aldehyde was added together with FMNH2 as in the Cu(I)-EO assay (Fig. 4). These properties of the individual subunits are qualitatively the same as that of the native luciferase(17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The latter has been shown to have an aldehyde substrate site and an independent aldehyde inhibitor site which competes against the FMNH2 binding. Furthermore, the binding of the aldehyde inhibitor is substantially slower than that of the FMNH2 and aldehyde substrate(17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The abilities of α and β subunits to bind FMNH2 and decanal (at micromolar levels to avoid inhibition) were examined by using the Job plot(20Job P. Ann. Chim. 1928; 9: 113-134Google Scholar). For aldehyde binding by α, a series of samples were set up to maintain a total concentration of 1 μM for α monomer plus decanal but with the mole fraction of decanal varying from zero to unity. When assayed in the presence of saturating FMNH2, the degrees of aldehyde binding are reflected by the observed bioluminescence activities. In a plot of activity versus mole fraction of decanal, the linear portions of the two sides of the curve can be extrapolated to obtain an interception point. A single decanal site per α monomer would correspond to an interception point at 0.5 mol fraction of decanal, whereas a mole fraction of 0.33 would support a single decanal site per α dimer. The observed data show a close fit to the theoretical plot for a binding stoichiometry of one decanal per α monomer (Fig. 5A, ■). However, when β was tested under identical conditions, the data indicate a binding stoichiometry of one decanal per β2 (Fig. 5A, □). Similar experiments were carried out to determine the binding of FMNH2 by α and β. Again, a single flavin site was detected for α monomer (Fig. 5B, ●) and for β2 (Fig. 5B, ○). The equilibrium bindings of decanal, at levels effective for inhibition, by individual subunits were determined using the gel filtration method of Hummel and Dryer(21Hummel J.P. Dreyer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 532-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). At 60 μM decanal, 2.5 nmol of α was found to bind 4.6 and 4.0 nmol of aldehyde on the basis of the areas of the leading peak and tailing through, respectively (Fig. 6A), giving an average of 1.7 decanal molecules bound per α monomer. For 2.3 nmol of β2 in the presence of 53 μM decanal, 3.8 and 4.0 nmol of decanal were bound according to the leading peak and tailing through areas, respectively, yielding an average of 1.7 decanal molecules bound per β dimer (Fig. 6B). These results indicate the existence of a second aldehyde site on α and β2 at aldehyde levels effective for inhibition. The kinetic and equilibrium constants of aldehyde binding by individual subunits were determined in chemical relaxation experiments similar to those detailed recently for the native luciferase(17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Each individual subunit was first equilibrated with decanal and then diluted 5-fold with buffer. After the dilution, the capacity of the sample to catalyze bioluminescence was measured at different times to determine the amount of aldehyde inhibitor-free subunit which increased over >20 s until a new equilibrium was reached. The experiment was repeated with 4 different initial decanal concentrations. The relaxation times (τ) of such processes can be determined from semilogarithmic plots of Δv/Δvoversus time of post-dilution incubation (Fig. 7A), where Δvo is the difference of the final activity minus the initial activity prior to dilution and Δv is the difference of the final activity minus the activity at a given time after the dilution. Furthermore, the relationship 1/τ = k1([E]e+ [Ai]e) + k-1 exists where k1 and k-1 are rate constants for binding and dissociation of aldehyde inhibitor (Ai) by individual subunit, respectively, and [E]e and [Ai]e are the concentrations of Ai-free subunit and free aldehyde at the new equilibrium state after dilution, respectively. By plotting 1/τ against [E]e+ [Ai]e, values of k1 and k-1 can be obtained and, subsequently, the dissociation constant for Ai can be determined as Ki = k-1/k1 (Fig. 7B). Analyses of experimental data as described above yield k1 values of 0.9 and 2.7 mM-1 s-1, k-1 values of 0.025 and 0.054 s-1, and Ki values of 27 and 20 μM for α and β2, respectively (Table I). The half-lives of the binding and dissociation of decanal inhibitor at 20 μM, for example, would be in the order of 10-40 s for both α and β2. In non-turnover assays, the bioluminescence intensity reaches a maximum in only ≤2 s when the reaction is initiated either by the substrate decanal (as in the D-EF assay) or FMNH2 (as in the Cu(I)-EAO assay). In comparison, the on and off rates for the decanal inhibitor binding are substantially slower than the binding of the decanal and FMNH2 substrates.Table I:Kinetic and equilibrium parameters of luciferase individual subunits Open table in a new tab In another series of experiments, a limiting level of an individual subunit was first equilibrated with varying levels of aldehyde, denoted as [A1st]. Subsequently, a solution containing saturating levels of aldehyde and FMNH2 was injected to initiate the bioluminescence. Assuming independent bindings of the aldehyde substrate (As) and inhibitor (Ai), the equilibrium binding of Ai during the first incubation period follows the relationship Ki = [E][A1st]/[EAi]. Since the binding and dissociation of the decanal inhibitor are much slower than the binding of the aldehyde and flavin substrates, the bioluminescence activity observed upon the secondary injection provides a measure of the amount of individual subunit free from the aldehyde inhibitor during the initial incubation. When the final aldehyde concentration is much greater than the Km for the aldehyde substrate, the observe activity would follow the relationship (17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) shown in Equation 1. By plotting 1/v against [A1st] (Fig. 8), values of Ki were obtained as 19 and 23 μM for α and β2, respectively (Table I). 1v=1Vmax+[A1st]VmaxKi(Eq. 1) A limiting level of decanal was first added to an excess amount of a subunit and, subsequently, a saturating level of FMNH2 was introduced to initiate the bioluminescence. Upon completion of the bioluminescence, aliquots were taken and tested for the remaining levels of decanal. The same type of measurements were also carried out using the native luciferase as a positive control. Under our experimental conditions, ~85% of the aldehyde was consumed by the native luciferase. whereas only ≤15% of aldehyde consumptions were detected for either of the two individual subunits. Two earlier studies (11Waddle J.J. Baldwin T.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) claim that the individual α and β subunits of V. harveyi luciferase were each active in bioluminescence. However, one recent study states that the individual α was inactive in vitro(13Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J.M. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10826-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and another reports that no activity was detected for α or β in vitro and in vivo(14Li Z. Szittner R. Meighen E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this work, we found that the isolated individual subunits were indeed active in bioluminescence. A number of general catalytic parameters such as specific activities, Kmfor FMNH2, Km for decanal, and light decay rates in the non-turnover assays using octanal, decanal, and dodecanal were determined for α and β (Table I). Values for these parameters, with the exception of the Km for decanal, were also reported by Sinclair et al.(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and are in good accord with those shown in. The individual subunits used in the studies by Waddle and Baldwin (11Waddle J.J. Baldwin T.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Sinclair et al.(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well as in this work were each expressed from a recombinant plasmid harboring either the luxA gene encoding only the α or the luxB gene encoding only the β. It is unlikely that the individual subunits so obtained were contaminated by their respective counter subunits. However, the specific activities of both individual subunits are about 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the native luciferase (Ref. 12;). Moreover, the general catalytic properties mentioned above for the individual subunits either are the same as or differ only slightly from those of the native luciferase. The possibility exists that the very low levels of bioluminescence activities observed for the individual subunits could be due to trace contaminations of the respective counter subunits. These considerations together with the apparently contradictory findings by different laboratories regarding the activities of individual subunits prompted us to more rigorously examine whether individual subunits are truly active. If the low activities observed with the isolated individual subunits were due to trace contaminations of the respective counter subunits, then the subunit samples should respond the same way as the native luciferase does to activity perturbation under identical conditions. Instead, we found that α and, especially, β were significantly more resistant than the native luciferase to inactivations by trypsin (Fig. 1) and N-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 2). In another series of experiments, the flavin 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate species formed with α and β subunits were found to have decay rate constants of 0.036 and 0.031 min-1, respectively, at 1°C. Both were close to three times more stable than the flavin peroxide intermediate formed with the native luciferase (Fig. 3). When each of the isolated subunits was chromatographed on a calibrated molecular sieve column, a single protein peak was observed which comigrated with the activity peak corresponding to 42,000 Mr for α monomer and 67,000 Mr for β dimer. If the bioluminescence activities in the isolated subunit samples were due to the presence of trace amounts of αβ, the activity peaks should be eluted at a position corresponding to 76,500 Mr and should be nondetectable by A280 reading. This is certainly not the case. Taking the results of activity perturbations, flavin peroxide intermediate stabilities, and molecular weights of the active subunit species together, it is clear that the observed bioluminescence activities are truly associated with individual subunits. Sensitivities to aldehyde inhibition have been reported long ago for the native V. harveyi luciferase (25Hastings J.W. Weber K. Friedland J. Eberhard A. Mitchell G.W. Gunsalus A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4681-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and recently for the individual subunits(12Sinclair J.F. Waddle J.J. Waddill E.F. Baldwin T.O. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have now carried out several investigations to characterize the aldehyde and flavin binding by the individual subunits. Regarding the effects of ligand preincubation on the bioluminescence activity, both individual subunits behave qualitatively the same as the native luciferase. Substantial inhibitions by decanal were observed when either subunit was preincubated with decanal before the flavin addition, whereas no inhibitions were detected when decanal was added after the flavin binding and very little inhibitions were observed when decanal and FMNH2 were added together (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that the bindings of decanal inhibitor by individual subunits were significantly slower than the binding of reduced flavin. At decanal concentrations low enough to obviate aldehyde inhibition, a single flavin site and a single aldehyde site were detected for both the monomeric α and the dimeric β (Fig. 5). The existence of a single active center per monomeric α and dimeric β is in good accord with the findings described earlier regarding α and β2 being the predominant and catalytically active species in the isolated individual subunit samples. At decanal concentrations effective for inhibition, the existence of a second aldehyde inhibitor site per α and β2 was observed (Fig. 6). The binding and dissociation rate constants for the decanal inhibitor were determined for both subunits using the approach of chemical relaxation (Fig. 7;). These processes were much slower than the bindings of the flavin and aldehyde substrates. The properties of the individual subunits with respect to aldehyde and flavin bindings are qualitatively quite similar to that of the native luciferase. Therefore, using the native luciferase as a model, the same kinetic scheme (17Lei B.-F. Cho K.W. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 5612-5618Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) can be proposed for the individual subunits regarding the mechanism of aldehyde inhibition. Briefly, α and β2 each has a tighter aldehyde substrate site and a weaker aldehyde inhibitor site. The binding of the aldehyde inhibitor blocks the FMNH2 binding thus resulting in inhibition. Moreover, the binding and dissociation of the aldehyde inhibitor are significantly slower than the bindings of aldehyde substrate and FMNH2. Hence, pronounced aldehyde inhibition is only detected when each subunit is equilibrated with aldehyde before the reduced flavin addition. On the basis of such a kinetic scheme, a linear relationship is expected between the reciprocal of the bioluminescence activity and the concentration of aldehyde during the initial incubation as described for Fig. 8. The expected linear relationships were indeed observed for α and β2. From such a graphic analysis, values of Ki for the decanal inhibitor binding were determined to be 19 and 23 μM for α and β2, respectively. These values are in good agreements with those determined by chemical relaxation (Table I). Interestingly, for subunits derived from the V. harveyi luciferase, the predominant and active form of the isolated α is monomeric, whereas that of β is dimeric. It should be pointed out that the individual β subunit of the Vibrio fischeri (originally designated as Photobacterium fischeri) luciferase is long known to assume a dimeric and/or higher polymeric form in aqueous solution(1Friedland J. Hastings J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2336-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the case of V. harveyi (formerly designated as MAV) luciferase, the apparent existence of α dimer has also been noted(25Hastings J.W. Weber K. Friedland J. Eberhard A. Mitchell G.W. Gunsalus A. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4681-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These earlier studies, however, did not establish whether the V. fischeri β2 or the V. harveyi α2 has any low level activity. At the present, at least two possibilities should be considered regarding the relationship between the subunit active sites and the single active site of the dimeric luciferase. First, α and β both contribute to the makeup of a single active site at the subunit interface of the native luciferase. In individual subunit forms, each retains sufficient characteristics of the native enzyme active site to be catalytically active but with a much reduced specific activity. Second, the single active site of luciferase is not a combination of two partial sites at the subunit interface. Upon subunit association, either the initial active sites of the two individual subunits are both inactivated and a new active site is generated in the dimeric luciferase or the active site of one subunit is inactivated while the other is greatly activated. The much reduced specific activities of α and β2 could be due to a number of reasons. It is known that the bioluminescence emission is coupled with the conversion of aldehyde to the acid product (4). The substantially diminished abilities to oxidize the aldehyde substrate by α and β2 were shown to, at least in part, contribute to their low light-emitting activities. The yields of FMN 4a-hydroperoxide intermediate by the individual subunits may also be compromised. Work is in progress to examine this possibility. The excited state of flavin 4a-hydroxide species has generally been regarded as the emitter in bacterial bioluminescence in the absence of secondary photo-proteins. Free flavin 4a-hydroxide model compounds are only very weakly fluorescent in solution (quantum yield ~10-5 or lower), whereas much enhanced fluorescence was observed upon freezing(27Ghisla S. Massey V. Lhoste J.-M. Mayhew S.G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that the luciferase flavin emitter (quantum yield ~0.1) is tightly bound by the luciferase and well shielded from the medium. While individual subunits retain the ability to catalyze bioluminescence, their active sites may well be more accessible to medium, hence, resulting in reduced emission efficiencies of the bound emitter. The decay rates of flavin peroxide intermediate II (kΣ) were determined at 1°C, whereas all other parameters were measured at 23°C."

A kinetic analysis of intramitochondrial sorting was performed. The intermediate-size form accumulated transiently in the matrix. When import was performed in the presence of metal chelators to prevent the first processing by the matrix processing peptidase, >40% of the imported precursor was localized in the matrix. A deletion of 13 amino acids in the intermembrane space sorting sequence caused partial inhibition of the first processing, and a transient accumulation of the precursor form in the matrix was also observed. The decrease in this matrix-localized precursor form paralleled an increase in the mature-size form in the intermembrane space. A point mutation in the mitochondrial targeting sequence (N-terminal to the sorting sequence) resulted in missorting to the matrix space. Furthermore, a chimeric protein consisting of the initial 85 residues of cytochrome b2 fused to dihydrofolate reductase was partially targeted to the matrix at 15°C, but not at 25°C.

A deletion of 13 amino acids in the intermembrane space sorting sequence caused partial inhibition of the first processing, and a transient accumulation of the precursor form in the matrix was also observed. The decrease in this matrix-localized precursor form paralleled an increase in the mature-size form in the intermembrane space. A point mutation in the mitochondrial targeting sequence (N-terminal to the sorting sequence) resulted in missorting to the matrix space. Furthermore, a chimeric protein consisting of the initial 85 residues of cytochrome b2 fused to dihydrofolate reductase was partially targeted to the matrix at 15°C, but not at 25°C. Together, the results presented here indicate that cytochrome b2 passes through the matrix on its sorting pathway to the intermembrane space. Cytochromes c1 and b2 are nuclear encoded proteins (9Guiard B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar; 23Sadler I. Suda K. Schatz G. Kaudewitz F. Haid A.

They are synthesized in the cytosol and are subsequently imported into mitochondria, where they are located in the intermembrane space. The precursors of both cytochromes possess cleavable bipartite signal sequences. The first part of this signal is a mitochondrial targeting sequence (12Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and directs the precursor to the mitochondria, where it mediates a potential-dependent insertion into the inner membrane and undergoes cleavage by the matrix processing peptidase complex in the mitochondrial matrix. The second part resembles a bacterial leader sequence and directs the intermediate-size forms into the intermembrane space (15Koll H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W.

Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The proteins are then finally processed to the mature-size forms by Imp1p/Imp2p proteases located at the outer face of the inner membrane (19Ohashi A. Gibson J. Gregor I. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 3Behrens M. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. & Gen.

Presently, there are two opinions as to how this intermembrane space sorting signal operates, namely the “stop transfer” model and the “conservative sorting” model (for review, see 6Glick B.S. Beasley E.M. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The stop transfer model proposes that the precursors initiate import along the general import pathway, but the sorting signal serves to arrest them in the inner membrane import machinery. Completion of translocation across the outer membrane is proposed to be driven by the dissociation of the outer and inner membrane import channels. Lateral diffusion out of the import site together with the maturation by the Imp1p protease in the case of cytochrome b2 would result in the release of soluble cytochrome b2 and assembly into tetrameric complexes in the intermembrane space (7Glick B.S. Wachter C. Reid G.A. Schatz G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1901-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of cytochrome c1, a C-terminal anchored inner membrane protein, it is proposed that once imported into the intermembrane space, the C-terminal segment undergoes a second independent insertion step into the inner membrane (30Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4787-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism for the sorting to the intermembrane space is the conservative sorting model, which accounts for the resemblance of the intramitochondrial targeting sequence to prokaryotic leader sequences (10Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar; 13Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). This model proposes that the precursors are imported along the general import pathway. Upon emergence in the matrix, the sorting signal initiates a retranslocation process back across the inner membrane to the intermembrane space. According to this model, import through the matrix could occur concomitantly with retranslocation back across the inner membrane. Earlier experimental data suggesting conservative sorting have been challenged by 5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar. The criticism concentrated on technical aspects that led, as the authors concluded, to an erroneous interpretation of the data in favor of conservative sorting. We have extended our previous investigations to determine as to whether import intermediates of cytochrome b2 pass through the matrix on their way to the intermembrane space. The data summarized below indicate that the sorting of cytochrome b2 indeed occurs via the matrix. Furthermore, evidence is presented that retranslocation into the intermembrane space may proceed mainly in parallel with the import process. Wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae (D273-10B) cells were grown in lactate medium (4Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected at an A578 of 1.5, and mitochondria were isolated according to 4Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Import of radiolabeled precursor into isolated mitochondria was performed as described previously (28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), with the exception of pb2-(1-85)-DHFR1 1The abbreviations used are: DHFRdihydrofolate reductaseMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (where pb2 is precytochrome b2) (20Rassow J. Hartl F.-U. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After the times indicated, the import reaction was stopped by adding valinomycin to a final concentration of 2 μM, and unless otherwise indicated, the samples were subjected to osmotic swelling. The samples were then split into three aliquots. Aliquot 1 was diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold SMKCl buffer (250 mM sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2). Aliquot 2 was diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold SMKCl buffer containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K. Aliquot 3 was diluted with 9 volumes of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K. After 30 min on ice, the protease was inactivated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1.6 mM and further incubation on ice for 5 min. Mitochondria from aliquots 1 and 2 and mitoplasts from aliquot 3 were reisolated by centrifugation. The pellet was solubilized in Laemmli buffer. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose. After autoradiography, data were quantified by laser densitometry (Ultroscan XL, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For the determination of the matrix-located species, the values obtained were corrected for the percentage of intact mitochondria still present in the mitoplast preparation. This was achieved by quantification of the amount of the protease-protected mature-size form for each time point with laser densitometry. Chase of the intermediate-size form across the inner membrane was tested as follows. Import of wild-type precytochrome b2 was performed at 12°C for 10 min. The mitochondria were reisolated and resuspended in hypotonic swelling buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 2 μg/ml trypsin). After 20 min at 0°C, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 20 times molar excess over trypsin. Then mitoplasts were further incubated for different time points at 25°C to allow translocation across the inner membrane. The chase incubation was performed in the presence of an energy-regenerating system (final concentrations: 10 μg/ml creatine kinase, 2.5 mM creatine phosphate, 2.5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM NADH, and 5 mM magnesium acetate). For determination of the mitoplast-located intermediate-size form, the samples were then treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K before SDS-PAGE. dihydrofolate reductase 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant DNA techniques were as described by 24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, synthesis of radiolabeled precursor proteins, and immunoblotting were carried out according to 28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. Digitonin fractionation was carried out by the method of 5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar. To analyze the sorting kinetics at a submitochondrial level, mitochondria, following the import of radiolabeled precytochrome b2, were subjected to hypotonic swelling in the presence of exogenously added protease (5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar; 28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As a control for efficient opening of the intermembrane space, we used the amount of the protease-resistant imported mature-size cytochrome b2 species in each mitoplast preparation; this serves as an internal indicator for the remaining intact mitochondria. Thereby, the level of the matrix-localized intermediate-size species could be specifically determined. Radiolabeled precytochrome b2 was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate and imported into isolated mitochondria at 25°C for the times indicated, after which import was stopped, and the submitochondrial location of the imported species was determined by hypotonic swelling (Fig. 1, A and B). Import of cytochrome b2 and processing to its mature size occurred in a linear fashion over a time period of 10-20 min, after which it reached a plateau. The intermediate-size species was observed in intact mitochondria at early time points; further incubation led to a decrease in this species as it became processed to the mature-size form. This mature-size species was exposed to the intermembrane space as it was found to be protease-sensitive after mitoplast formation. Approximately 25% of the total imported intermediate-size form was detected as protease-protected in mitoplasts after 5 min of import (Fig. 1C). The level of this matrix-localized species declined upon further incubation, which was reflected by a decrease in the total imported intermediate-size form. When the import reaction was performed at 12°C, the overall import process was slightly retarded (Fig. 2, A and B). The kinetics of both formation of and decrease in the intermediate-size form in the matrix were also slower, with a peak being reached after 15 min. At this time point, ∼50% of the total imported intermediate-size species was localized in the matrix space (Fig. 2C). Further incubation led to a reduction to about half of its original level after 90 min of import. The results demonstrate that a considerable amount of the total imported intermediate-size form transiently accumulated in the matrix at early time points. The pool of the matrix-localized intermediate-size form was increased when import was performed at a lower temperature. Furthermore, the results show that the pool of the intermediate-size form protected in the matrix is not large enough to serve as a source for the total amount of the mature-size species arising in the intermembrane space. It should also be pointed out that protease sensitivity of intermediate- and mature-size forms in mitoplasts does not necessarily indicate that the complete polypeptide chain is present in the intermembrane space; rather, it demonstrates that at least a part of the species is exposed to this location (8Gruhler A. Ono H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether the intermediate-size species, once located in the matrix, could be chased to the intermembrane space in a second incubation reaction. For these experiments, the intermediate-size species was accumulated in the matrix by import for 10 min at 12°C. Mitochondria were subjected to hypotonic swelling in the presence of a low concentration of protease (for details, see “Materials and Methods”). The resulting mitoplasts were then further incubated at 25°C in order to allow retranslocation across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space. However, the matrix-localized intermediate could be neither chased across the inner membrane nor converted into the mature-size form, but rather remained stable in the mitoplasts throughout the chase period (Fig. 2D). Thus, it appears that once stalled, the export process cannot be reinitiated. As no proteolytic degradation of this matrix-localized species was observed throughout this prolonged chase, the decrease in the matrix-located intermediate-size form observed in the kinetic analysis in intact mitochondria (Fig. 2C) probably reflects further export to the intermembrane space. The addition of metal chelators such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline inhibits proteolytic removal of the signal sequence by matrix processing peptidase and consequently leads to accumulation of uncleaved precursors (26Schmidt B. Wachter E. Sebald W. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; 11Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of processing inhibition on the sorting, precytochrome b2 was imported at 12°C into isolated mitochondria in the presence of EDTA/o-phenanthroline (Fig. 3, A and B). No intermediate-size form was observed, suggesting that the mature-size cytochrome b2 was derived directly from its precursor form; alternatively, incomplete inhibition of matrix processing peptidase may result in a very low amount of the intermediate-size species, that could be immediately converted into the mature-size form. The kinetics of formation of the mature-size species was similar to the uninhibited situation (compare Fig. 2B and 3A). A large percentage of the imported uncleaved precursor was observed in the matrix, and the kinetics of its accumulation there and subsequent decrease were delayed as compared with those of the intermediate-size form in the uninhibited control (Fig. 3B and 2C). We conclude therefore that processing of the precursor by matrix processing peptidase is not required for correct sorting of cytochrome b2. We investigated the sorting of several selected mutations in the cytochrome b2 presequence. First, a deletion mutant, precytochrome b2 (Δ34-46), was studied in which were eliminated the 13 amino acid residues that precede the basic amino acid cluster in the sorting signal, which has been demonstrated to be crucial for the correct sorting of cytochrome b2 (Fig. 4) (2Beasley E.M. Müller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; 28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled pb2-(Δ34-46) was imported into mitochondria at 25°C for the times indicated (Fig. 5A). Processing to the mature-size form and sorting to the intermembrane space were only slightly affected in this mutant. The mutation resulted in a reduced processing efficiency by matrix processing peptidase in comparison to the wild-type situation (see Fig. 1A). Localization experiments revealed that >30% of the total imported precursor species was present in the matrix after 5 min of import at 25°C (Fig. 5B). The precursor form transiently accumulated in the matrix, and its appearance and disappearance occurred with kinetics similar to those observed for the intermediate-size form of wild-type cytochrome b2. The small amount of the intermediate-size species formed was almost completely maintained in the matrix over a time period of 45 min, suggesting that it is incompetent for correct sorting. Thus, the mature-size species is generated directly from the imported precursor species. The deletion mutant lacks residues required for the efficient sorting to the intermembrane space. This defect, however, becomes severe only when processing by matrix processing peptidase has taken place. Mutations close to the matrix processing peptidase cleavage site of the cytochrome b2 presequence can result in an inhibition of processing by matrix processing peptidase. The mutation of Arg to Gly at position 30 in the matrix targeting sequence of cytochrome b2 (two residues N-terminal to the matrix processing peptidase cleavage site) has been reported to cause a complete block of matrix processing peptidase processing in vitro (1Arretz M. Schneider H. Guiard B. Brunner M. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4959-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sorting kinetics of this mutant precytochrome b2 was analyzed at 25°C. The precursor was imported into isolated mitochondria, but did not undergo processing to the mature-size form (Fig. 6A). Rather, it accumulated unprocessed, with the majority being in the matrix (Fig. 6B). No proteolytic degradation of this mislocalized species was observed after prolonged incubation periods. The fact that a mutation N-terminal to the first processing resulted in missorting to the matrix space can be explained by an altered conformation of the sorting sequence or by an altered charge distribution. Thereby, the sorting signal may no longer be recognized for transport to the intermembrane space. The sorting of a fusion protein consisting of the first 85 amino acids of cytochrome b2 and DHFR, pb2-(1-85)-DHFR, was analyzed. This fusion protein contains the complete cytochrome b2 presequence plus five amino acids of the mature sequence fused to DHFR. To study the mitochondrial sorting of this fusion protein, we used a second sublocalization technique, digitonin titration analysis in the presence of proteinase K, to successively access the intermembrane space and matrix (5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled pb2-(1-85)-DHFR was imported into mitochondria at 15°C, after which the sample was trypsin-treated and divided. Mitochondria from one-half were fractionated immediately with digitonin (Fig. 7A, 15°C), while the other half was further incubated in a chase reaction at 25°C and then subjected to digitonin treatment (Fig. 7A, 15°C → 25°C). Following import at 15°C, the fusion protein accumulated largely as its intermediate-size species. Fractionation of these mitochondria revealed that a significant proportion of this species (35%) was present in the matrix. The small amount of the mature-size form was correctly sorted to the intermembrane space. The matrix-localized intermediate-size species failed to become chased out of the matrix into the intermembrane space when exposed to elevated temperatures. Instead, this intermediate underwent processing to a smaller species, the i* form (28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An increase in mature-size b2-(1-85)-DHFR was observed following the chase reaction. This species is very likely derived from the Imp1p processing of intermediate b2-(1-85)-DHFR, which had already been correctly translocated to the intermembrane space in the first incubation at 15°C. In contrast, when the same fusion protein was imported into mitochondria at 25°C, processing to the intermediate- and mature-size species occurred. Both forms were located in the intermembrane space (Fig. 7B, 25°C). These results suggest that correct sorting of this short fusion protein is temperature-dependent, with a higher proportion becoming missorted at lower temperatures. This conclusion was supported by the kinetic analysis of sorting of this protein at the two chosen temperatures (Fig. 7C). At low temperature (12°C), intermediate-size species accumulated in the matrix in a time-dependent manner. However, at 25°C, a transient accumulation in the matrix was observed; this accumulation was much less pronounced than that observed with, for example, wild-type cytochrome b2, thus demonstrating that the levels of matrix-located intermediates can vary, even between different preproteins with the same presequence. The data demonstrate that pb2-(1-85)-DHFR is not efficiently sorted to the intermembrane space at 15°C in contrast to 25°C. This result is inconsistent with the stop transfer model of sorting as import at lower temperatures has been reported to slow down translocation through the import machinery (25Schleyer M. Neupert W. Cell. 1985; 43: 339-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and should therefore enhance the sorting according to a stop transfer mechanism. Rather, these findings suggest a temperature-sensitive export process that most likely occurs in parallel with completion of the import process. If, however, this process becomes temporally separated by retarding the export step, e.g. at lower temperatures, it appears that the sorting process cannot resume. Sorting of cytochrome b2 into the intermembrane space along the conservative sorting pathway has recently been contested. In an analysis carried out by 5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, <1% of the imported species was reported to be the matrix-located intermediate-size form. The authors explained the discrepancy between their findings and the previously published data (10Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) by the different experimental techniques. Thus, we have investigated the sorting of cytochrome b2 to the intermembrane space by undertaking detailed kinetic analysis and by applying the mitochondrial subfractionation procedure developed by 5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar. The sorting kinetics of cytochrome b2 presented above revealed that 25-50% of the imported intermediate-size form was located in the matrix space at early time points of import. Concomitant with an increase in the mature-size form in the intermembrane space, the intermediate-size form in the matrix declined. The data imply that the decrease in the intermediate-size form in the matrix is due to a retranslocation into the intermembrane space, with intermediate-size forms representing sorting intermediates on their way to the final subcompartment. In agreement with the data presented above, the current model of conservative sorting postulates the following scenario. Sorting to the intermembrane space requires that at least the complete bipartite presequence of cytochrome b2 has to be initially imported into the matrix space. Upon emergence in the matrix, the sorting sequence assumes a conformation that is recognized by a sorting component(s) in the matrix or at the inner face of the inner membrane. The interaction with this putative component initiates insertion of the sorting signal into the inner membrane from the matrix side. Complete import of the intermediate-size form into the matrix space is not necessarily required for correct sorting into the intermembrane space. Rather, the prevailing part of cytochrome b2 sorting intermediates probably loops through the matrix space “coupling import with export” and thus cannot be detected as fully matrix-imported intermediate-size forms. Accordingly, the 25% of the total imported intermediate-size forms that transiently accumulated as protease-protected species in the matrix may represent sorting intermediates that have already engaged in the retranslocation process. On the other hand, when the intermediate-size form was accumulated in the matrix at low temperature, this species could not be chased into the intermembrane space and was observed to be stably maintained in the matrix. These data suggest that translocation back across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space may be coupled with the import process. Once halted, retranslocation may be unable to resume as folding of segments of the polypeptide chain in the matrix may prevent further transport. According to a stop transfer mechanism, inhibition of the first processing event by matrix processing peptidase should not affect the transmembrane arrest of cytochrome b2 and thus should not result in missorting of the precursor into the matrix. However, as demonstrated, inhibition of matrix processing peptidase by removal of divalent cations in fact led to import of a substantial amount of precursor into the matrix space. In contrast to the data presented by 5Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Müller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, but in agreement with our earlier data (11Hartl F.-U. Ostermann J. Guiard B. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), ∼40% of the total imported precursor was found to be located in the matrix space. Inhibition of precursor processing was also observed for precytochrome b2 (Δ34-46), which contains a deletion of 13 residues preceding the basic amino acid cluster of the sorting signal. Only the precursor form was able to be translocated into the intermembrane space; the small amount of the intermediate-size species formed remained stable in the matrix. Since the decrease in the matrix-localized mutant precursor form inversely paralleled the increase in the mature-size form, we conclude that the presence of a mitochondrial targeting sequence probably suppresses the adverse effect of the deletion, which renders the intermediate incompetent for translocation. Again, the stable maintenance of the mutant intermediate-size form in the matrix indicates that in the case where a decline in the intermediate-size form was observed for wild-type preproteins, it reflects a translocation process out of the matrix and not proteolytic breakdown. Several amino acid residues in the sorting sequence have been demonstrated to be crucial for sorting to the intermembrane space (2Beasley E.M. Müller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; 28Schwarz E. Seytter T. Guiard B. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1993; 12 (and references therein): 2295-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both sorting models agree that a very specific recognition step is required for sorting to the subcompartment. This is easy to imagine with a conservative sorting mechanism, but poses problems with a stop transfer process. In the latter, membrane components, which form the import channel for the passage of hundreds of matrix-targeted precursors, in the case of cytochrome b2 and probably also cytochrome c1 would specifically bind to the sorting sequence to ensure their arrest and thus prevent their complete translocation across the inner membrane. As demonstrated above, not only mutations in the 50 residues comprising the sorting signal itself result in precursor accumulation in the matrix space. Rather, also an exchange at position −2 of the intermembrane space targeting sequence (two amino acid residues N-terminal to the matrix processing peptidase cleavage site) led to mistargeting to the matrix space. This observation can easily be explained by an alteration in conformation or charge distribution that no longer allows recognition by the sorting component and/or insertion into the inner membrane. The fact that the mutation lies N-terminal to the sorting sequence makes an interpretation according to a stop transfer pathway difficult. These findings on the signal sequence requirements imply that a putative stop transfer component located in the import channel would have to recognize a segment longer than 50 residues. Bearing this in mind, it is hard to conceive how such a long stretch can operate as a stop transfer signal in the inner membrane during the translocation process. One would have to postulate that it must adopt a complex secondary structure during translocation. At the same time, the inner membrane channel would display an inertness toward all matrix-targeted proteins and a number of inner membrane proteins that contain similar hydrophobic stretches and that are clearly sorted into the matrix (17Mahlke K. Pfanner N. Martin J. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; 21Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sorting process was shown to be affected at reduced temperatures for pb2-(1-85)-DHFR, resulting in accumulation of missorted species in the matrix under these conditions. Low temperature should actually enhance arrest in the translocation channel; and thus, temperature dependence of sorting is inconsistent with the stop transfer model. Finally, in this study, we have focused on the transient accumulation of intermediate-size forms of cytochrome b2 in the matrix in such a manner that they become inaccessible to protease added to mitoplasts. This procedure leads to degradation of cytochrome b2 sorting intermediates that are completely sorted to the intermembrane space together with those that are only partially exposed to this compartment, i.e. that could be still spanning the inner membrane and undergoing an export event. In a separate study, we have shown that indeed a large proportion of intermediate- and even mature-size cytochrome b2 species span the inner membrane and thereby expose segments to the matrix space (8Gruhler A. Ono H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations are fully consistent with the conclusion of the present study, namely sorting of cytochrome b2 through the mitochondrial matrix.

Using a series of variant receptors incorporating all 19 possible substitutions for each individual P-box amino acid of the human thyroid hormone receptor (hT3Rβ), we demonstrated that the first P-box position must have a glutamate, and the second P-box position must have either an alanine or a glycine for high affinity binding to everted repeat elements with half-site sequences of AGGNCA. In the present study, the influence of half-site flanking sequence on the compatibility of P-box amino acids in hT3Rβ with DNA binding was investigated. When a 5′ sequence of CTG flanked AGGNCA half-sites in an everted repeat, several additional P-box variant receptors were able to bind to the DNA that were not able to bind when the half-sites were flanked with the 5′ sequence CAG. Flanking sequence had the most dramatic effects on amino acid substitutions at the first P-box position, with smaller effects observed at the second P-box position and only subtle effects observed at the third P-box position. Expansion of the number of P-box sequences compatible with binding of hT3Rβ to thyroid hormone response elements required the thymidine in the CTG flanking sequence, an everted repeat of the AGGNCA half-sites, and an intermolecular interaction in the C terminus of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2019678556,"The in vivo import of liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase was investigated in yeast by constructing fusion proteins between its leader sequence and β-galactosidase. Only 7% of the protein was imported. If 21 or 71 amino acids from the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase were included in the construct, 40% was imported. The protein remaining in cytosol was sequenced. When the leader was fused directly to β-galactosidase, the first 7 residues of the leader were missing. When 21 residues of mature aldehyde dehydrogenase were included, the entire leader plus 6 residues of the mature portion were missing; if 71 residues of mature aldehyde dehydrogenase were included, the first residue found corresponds to the 66th residue of the mature portion. When the leader was fused directly to β-galactosidase, no processing of the imported protein occurred, and the N-terminal amino acid was blocked, presumably by acetylation. If the 21-amino acid insert was included, processing occurred. A modified leader sequence lacking the three-amino acid linker (RGP) was imported but not processed, just as we found in vitro (Thornton, K., Wang, Y., Weiner, H., and Gorenstein, D.G.(1993) J. Biol.

INTRODUCTIONIt has been proposed that the leader sequences which allow precursor proteins to be transported into mitochondria contain amphilpathic helices(1von Heijine G.

The structure of three processed and three nonprocessed leaders sequences have been determined by two-dimensional NMR(6Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.M. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G.

The leader sequence for rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 1The abbreviations used are: ALDHaldehyde dehydrogenasepALDHprecursor aldehyde dehydrogenasemALDHmature aldehyde dehydrogenaseX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactosidebpbase pairkbkilobase pair. was found to be composed of three structural components(6Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.M. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These were two short segments of α helices separated by a three-amino acid linker (RGP). We investigated the necessity of each region by making deletions or by constructing chimeric leader sequences with components of cytochrome oxidase, a protein whose leader sequence also was determined by two-dimensional NMR(8Endo T. Shinada F. Roise D. Inagaki R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We concluded that the minimum structural requirement of the leader peptide was just a two-turn amphilpathic α helix at the N termini of the leader sequence(11Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the other portions of the leader was proposed to stabilize the N-terminal helix. The experiments that led to these conclusions were performed with isolated rat liver mitochondria employing proteins synthesized in rabbit reticulocytes. Data obtained from in vitro import studies are thought to represent what occurs in vivo because the cytosolic factors necessary to allow import to occur are supplied by the reticulocyte system. We felt it would be advantageous to investigate the peptides in a true in vivo system, rather than just the in vitro one employed, to verify our observations.Investigators have often used yeast to study import(12Emr S.D.

Emr S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leader sequences were fused to carrier proteins in order to ascertain residues in the leader important for import. A common carrier protein employed is β-galactosidase because of the ease of assaying the enzyme. Typically, mitochondria are separated from cytosol, and the amount of β-galactosidase activity in each organelle is used as a measure of import. The leader sequence from rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase and an altered sequence we employed in the in vitro studies were fused to β-galactosidase on a yeast expression vector to test whether the observations made in the in vitro system were valid in vivo. It will be shown that the fusion of the leader sequence directly to β-galactosidase produced a protein that was poorly imported. In contrast, if some residues of the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase were included, then the protein could be imported into mitochondria, but much of the fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrain and Growth ConditionSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain KX 147-2C (MATα leu1 LEU4fbrura52(17Brisco P.R.G. Kohlhaw G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11667-11675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Prof. Gunter B. Kohlhaw of this department). Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in SD medium, which contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and supplemented with 2 mM leucine. Escherichia coli strains used were TG1 and MC1000(18Casadaban M.J. Martinez-Arias A. Sharipa S.K. Chou J. Method Enzymol. 1983; 100: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). E. coli was grown at 37°C in LB medium or 2 × yeast tryptone medium. Ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The lithium acetate method (19Ito H. Fukuka Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacterial. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for yeast transformation. E. coli transformation was as described by Maniatis et al.(20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar).DNA ManipulationStandard DNA techniques were performed as described elsewhere(20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar, 21Guthrie C. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the “Muta-Gene” mutagenesis kit by Bio-Rad, which is based on the procedure of Kunkel(22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 380A synthesizer by the Laboratory for Macromolecular Structure, Purdue University. DNA sequencing was determined by the dideoxy chain-termination method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar), using single-stranded template or alkali-denatured, double-stranded DNA and Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Some DNA fragments were synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase performed for 30 cycles with the following program: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 52°C, and 2 min at 72°C.Construction of Plasmid VectorFor mutagenesis and sequencing, plasmid pYH305 and pYH305DE were constructed. For pYH305, the 2.8-kb SacI-ScaI fragment from pGEM-3Z that contained the 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment of pALDH of rat liver was isolated and ligated to Bluescript SKII(+), which was cut with SacI and ScaI. For pYH305DE, an EcoRI site in the middle of the pALDH coding region in pYH305 was removed by mutagenesis. This just changed the codon for the same amino acid.ALDH-lacZ Gene Fusion ConstructionsThe rat liver ALDH cDNA has been cloned and the entire nucleotide sequence has been determined (24). A set of plasmid pGEM-3Z containing the pALDH sequence with various modified signal peptides has been constructed for in vitro import study(11Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids were cut with EcoRI and PvuII. The 308 bp of EcoRI-PvuII fragments which include 19 amino acids of the signal region and 71 amino acids of the ALDH coding region were isolated by running digested DNA on 3% NuSieve GTG gel. They were then ligated into the EcoRI and SmaI sites of plasmid pSEYC102, a yeast centromere plasmid (10.5 kb), containing the yeast URA3, CEN4-ARS1, pBR322 sequence and unique EcoRI, SmaI, and BamHI sites to the 5′ side of the truncated lacZ gene. Plasmid pYB1 has a 1.7-kb BamHI fragment including 645 bp of the leu2 promoter region, 637 bp of the leu2 coding region, and 400 bp of the bacterial sequence. Using the 1.7-kb BamHI fragment as the template, a 0.64-kb EcoRI-SphI fragment of leu2 promoter was synthesized by a polymerase chain reaction, and then this fragment was inserted into the above ligated plasmids which had been digested with EcoRI and SphI. The resulting plasmids have a leu2 promoter-ALDH-lacZ fusion (Fig. 1). The plas-mid without the DNA fragment of the leader is the same as the native plasmid except the leader sequence has been removed by creating a SphI site at the 18th amino acid position of leader region by mutagenesis.To construct a fusion protein with a shorter portion of mature ALDH and to obtain high expression of the fusion protein, other ALDH-lacZ gene fusions were constructed, and a multiple copy plasmid was adopted. An oligonucleotide with sequence CGGAATTCTCGAGGAGAAC, which corresponds to nucleotides from −653 to −634 and contains an EcoRI restriction site (underlined), was used as the sense primer for the polymerase chain reaction experiments. The antisense oligonucleotide for the construction of the fusion proteins which contain 21 amino acid residues of mALDH was AATCGGATCCTGGTTGCAGAAGACCTCGGG (corresponding to amino acid residues 15-24 of mALDH) and for the construction of the fusion proteins without any portion of mALDH was GGGATCCAGCAGGCGGCTCAGGCGTGGCCC (corresponding to −8 to +2 amino acid residues), in which a BamHI restriction site (underlined) was made, respectively. The plasmid DNAs shown in Fig. 1 were used as templates. All the DNA fragments amplified by polymerase chain reaction were then subcloned into vector pSEYC101 between the EcoRI and BamHI sites. These plasmids can normally be maintained in multiple copies per yeast cell due to the presence of the 2μ gene.In frame fusions between ALDH and lacZ were isolated after transformation into E. coli strain MC1000 on plates containing X-gal. The precise fusion joints were verified by DNA sequencing. All of the plasmids can be shuttled between E. coli and yeast. The β-galactosidase-positive E. coli transformants were selected. The plasmid DNA isolated from them finally were transformed to yeast XK147-2C and tested for β-galactosidase expression on a yeast minimal medium containing X-gal. Yeast cells expressing β-galactosidase were verified by measuring enzymatic activity in cell-free extracts.Cellular Fractionation and Enzyme AssayYeast cells were grown to 1.5 optical density units at 600 nm in SD medium supplemented with leucine. Cells were fractionated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions essentially according to the procedure of Daum et al.(25Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were prepared from yeast cells in the presence of Lyticase (Sigma). Finally, mitochondria were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.6 M mannitol buffer. For enzyme assay, the reaction buffer contained 1% Triton X-100. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in Z buffer by the method of Miller (26Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 30°C. The recovery of mitochondria relative to cytosol was monitored by assaying the mitochondrial marker enzyme fumarase (27Bergmeyer H.U. Gawehn K. Grassl M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 452-453Google Scholar) and the cytosolic marker enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase(28Lohr G.W. Waller H.D. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York1974: 636-643Crossref Google Scholar).Purification of β-Galactosidase-Fusion ProteinsAll subsequent steps were carried out at 0-4°C in the presence of protease inhibitors (Pefabloc SC, 1 mg/ml; o-phenanthroline, 5 mM; leupeptin, 3 μg/ml; pepstatin, 15 μg/ml; phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM; EDTA, 1 mM). Nucleic acids were precipitated from the post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions by adding slowly 2.5% protamine sulfate with constant stirring to give a final concentration of 0.1%. After stirring for 30 min at 4°C, the solution was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min(29Badaracco G. Plevani P. Ruyechan W.T. Chang L.M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2022-2026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal volume of 100% (of saturation) ammonium sulfate solution was added slowly with stirring. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was then suspended in Tris-HCl buffer (0.25 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100) and dialyzed against 100 volumes of the same buffer for a minimum of 2 h while changing the buffer three times. The dialysate was passed through a β-galactose analog affinity column(30Germino J. Gray J.G. Charbonneau H. Vanaman T. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6848-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of the buffer, followed by 5 bed volumes of the buffer without Triton X-100. The protein was eluted from the column with 0.1 M sodium borate (pH 10) and promptly precipitated with 100% saturated ammonium sulfate.To extract the fusion protein from mitochondria, the mitochondria were diluted with an equal volume of distilled water to give a hypotonic condition and were lysed for 15-30 min by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 at 0-4°C. They were then sonicated at 0°C for 30 s two times using a Fisher-Artek model 300 sonic dismembrator at a power setting of 85% relative output. Membrane fragments and other debris were removed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against the same buffer used for affinity chromatography and then passed through the substrate analog affinity column.Protein SequencingN-terminal protein sequencing was performed by the Purdue University Biochemistry Department Protein Sequencing Facility on samples electrophoretically transferred from 8% SDS gels to a membrane as described previously(31Jeng J. Weiner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Miscellaneous ChemicalsAll the restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs, Boehringer-Mannheim, Promega, or Life Technologies, Inc. A prestained molecular weight standard for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was from Bio-Rad. Alkaline-phosphatase conjugate anti-mouse IgG and mouse anti-β-galactosidase monoclonal antibody were from Promega. Rabbit anti-pALDH signal peptide antibody was previously prepared in our laboratory. Protease inhibitor set was from Boehringer Mannheim. p-Aminophenyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside-Sepharose 4B was from Sigma. Western blotting was as previously described(32Ghenbot G. Weiner H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All other reagents were commercially available analytical reagents.RESULTSβ-Galactosidase Expression in YeastThe plasmids for the gene fusion constructs which contained the leu2 promoter/N terminal native and modified precursor (Fig. 2) ALDH were fused in frame to the 10th amino acid of lacZ (Fig. 1). β-Galactosidase activity for all constructs was found in both E. coli and yeast, and no activity was expressed from the parent vector in these cells. The level of β-galactosidase expressed in crude yeast extracts from all of the gene fusions was essentially identical. The reason is that these have been constructed in the plasmid pSEYC102 which contains the yeast centromere sequence CEN4 and the sequence ARS1 which allows for the maintenance of essentially one copy of the plasmid per cell.Figure 2:The amino acid sequences of the signal peptides. Amino acids in italics are from the mature part of ALDH. Linker deletion is wild type presequence without the (RGP) linker which connects the N- and C-terminal helices.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The constructs containing the ALDH/β-galactosidase fusion was also cloned into the SEYC101 vector which are maintained in multicopy in the cells. Activity assays showed that all constructs were expressed to the same extent but at a level more than 10-fold higher than with the single copy plasmid (Table I).Table I:Distribution of fusion proteins between mitochondria and cytosol Open table in a new tab Assaying for β-galactosidase activity in isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions allowed us to determine whether import occurred in vivo. If the leader sequence of ALDH was not included in the construct, 99% of the total β-galactosidase activity was found associated with the cytosol fraction, showing that, as expected, the enzyme could not be imported into mitochondria if it did not possess a mitochondrial leader sequence.Import of β-Galactosidase Chimera Possessing a Leader Sequence Requires the Presence of a Portion of the Mature ProteinThe leader sequence of aldehyde dehydrogenase was fused directly to the 10th residue of β-galactosidase. It was unexpected to find that for this construct only 7% of the β-galactosidase activity was found in the mitochondrial pellet with the remainder in the cytosolic fraction. The constructs containing 21 or 31 amino acids of mature ALDH between the leader sequence and β-galactosidase were imported to a much greater extent (40%). The distribution of β-galactosidase activity be-tween mitochondria and cytosol for the ALDH chimera is presented in.Amino Acid Sequence of the β-Galactosidase Chimera Found in CytosolLack of import could have resulted from at least two unrelated events. We showed that a disruption of the N-terminal helix of the leader sequence affected its ability to function(11Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly, the three-dimensional structure of the leader sequence was affected by the presence of β-galactosidase being fused to it. Alternatively, if the leader sequence was modified in vivo prior to import, the precursor protein would not enter mitochondria. To test for this possibility, β-galactosidase was isolated from the cytosol and subjected to amino acid sequencing. When the chimera with no intervening sequence between the leader and β-galactosidase was employed, the protein was found to be lacking the N-terminal portion of the leader sequence. The first amino acid identified corresponded to the 6th residue of the leader. The proteins which were designed to contain intervening segments of mature aldehyde dehydrogenase were found to be missing all of the leader sequence plus part of the mature aldehyde dehydrogenase portion. When the construct with 71 residues of mature ALDH was analyzed, the first amino acid corresponded to the 66th residue of the mature portion of ALDH. When the construct with 21 intervening residues was analyzed, the first amino acid found corresponded to the 7th residue of the mature portion of ALDH. These sequences are shown in Table II and illustrated in Fig. 3.Table II:1768843040p4in α Not determinable. Open table in a new tab Figure 3:Cleavage site of the fusion protein isolated from cytosol. The numbers 1-19 above the filled lines indicate the leader sequence. The numbers below the single line indicate the intervening sequence of mature ALDH in the fusion protein. The position of the first amino acid found from sequencing the fusion protein is indicated by the numbers 66, 7, and 6, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Amino Acid Sequences of Protein Isolated from Mitochondria after ImportThe β-galactosidase from two fusion proteins possessing the native leader sequence were isolated from mitochondria and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. The first had the leader fused directly to β-galactosidase; the second had the 21-amino acid insert. No sequence could be found from the protein missing the insert, suggesting that the N-terminal residue was blocked. A Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody generated to recognize only the leader region to verify that the leader sequence was still attached to β-galactosidase (Fig. 4).Figure 4:The Western blot analysis of the fusion proteins in mitochondria. Samples were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed by anti-signal peptide antibody (A) and anti-β-galactosidase antibody (B). Mitochondrial fractions of pZ001 (no intervening sequence for mature ALDH, lane 1), pZ211 (21 amino acids from mature ALDH, lane 2), and pZ212 (linker deleted with 21 amino acids from mature ALDH, lane 3) were loaded, respectively. The band near 139 Kd is the fusion protein. The molecular weight standards were prestained by Coomassie Blue (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When the 21-amino acid portion of ALDH was included in the construct, the leader sequence was removed by the mitochondrial processing enzyme. The amino acid sequence corresponded to the first residues of the mature portion of ALDH, showing that processing occurred at the expected site located between RLL, the last 3 residues of the leader, and SAA of the mature protein (Table III and Fig. 2). Western blot analysis using the antibody against the leader sequence was negative, as expected, for a protein missing the leader.Table III:N-terminal sequencing of purified fusion protein isolated from mitochondria Open table in a new tab We showed in the in vitro system that, if the three-amino acid linker (RGP) of the native rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase leader sequence was missing, import occurred but not processing(7Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chimeric protein from this construct was isolated from yeast mitochondria, but no sequence could be obtained, because the N-terminal amino acid was found to be blocked. No attempt was made to identify the blocking group, but Western blot analysis showed that the leader was still present.DISCUSSIONFusion proteins composed of the leader sequence of a mitochondrial precursor protein and a carrier protein have been used to investigate import of proteins into mitochondria(12Emr S.D.

Investigators have often deleted portions of the leader sequence in an attempt to determine the minimum number of amino acids necessary for a leader sequence to function. If a construct containing a modified leader was not imported, it was assumed that the section deleted was vital.β-Galactosidase is a commonly employed carrier protein used to study import in yeast(12Emr S.D.

Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Some investigators have suggested, although never proven, that the size (1023 amino acids) may have been responsible for its not allowing a leader sequence to function, for if the same peptide was fused to, say, dihydrofolate reductase, in vitro import would occur. We showed that the rate of import of precursors proteins could be a function of the size of the mature portion of the protein (33). Thus the large size of the β-galactosidase fusion protein may have contributed to its not functioning well in some systems.We found that, when the leader sequence from rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase was fused directly to β-galactosidase, little of the total enzyme activity was found associated with yeast mitochondria. This was an unexpected finding since the leader worked well in causing the import of mature ALDH and orithine transcarbamylase into rat liver mitochondria and into isolated yeast mitochondria.2 2Y.-K. Pak and H. Weiner, unpublished data. Douglas et al. (34), however, reported that it was not possible to import F1-ATPase fused directly to β-galactosidase.If proteolysis occurred prior to import it would not be possible for the precursor protein to be translocated into mitochondria. To test for this, the fusion proteins remaining in the cytosol were isolated and sequenced. The chimeric proteins isolated from yeast cytosol were missing some or all of the leader sequence. Undoubtedly, the portion of the protein was removed by the action of a protease located in the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that deletion of residues at the N-terminal end of the leader sequence prevented ALDH from being translocated into rat liver mitochondria(6Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.M. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus the reason for the lack of import of the fusion proteins employed in this study was the fact that the leader was destroyed or removed by the action of proteases in the cell prior to import.It is impossible to state whether the proteolysis occurred in one step by the action of an endopeptidase, or by the sequential removal of single amino acids by the action of an N-terminal amino acid peptidase. The argument against the latter is the fact that only one peptide sequence was obtained for each protein. If the amino acids were being removed sequentially, it could be expected that a very ragged N-terminal sequence would have been found. We have no data to determine whether or not the protease was specific. As shown in, when 0, 21-, or 71-amino acid residues from the mature portion of ALDH were included, proteolysis occurred at different positions. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence (24Farrés J. Guan K.-L. Weiner H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) the cleavage occurred between an L-S, an S-A, and an A-R bond when 0, 21, and 71 residues of ALDH were included in the chimera, respectively. If there were three specific proteases involved, it could have been expected to have obtained three different amino acid sequences when the construct containing 71 amino acids was employed.Even though proteolysis occurred which prevented some of the protein from entering the mitochondria, a portion of the newly synthesized precursor protein was found in the mitochondria. Although only 7% of the protein was imported into the mitochondria when the aldehyde dehydrogenase leader sequence was fused directly to β-galactosidase, no processing occurred after import. This could have been a result of the destruction of the processing site. When the leader was fused to β-galactosidase through 21 amino acids of the mature ALDH, a sequence was obtained. The amino acid sequence of the protein revealed that it was processed at the expected site. This is the first proof that the actual site of processing of the ALDH leader sequence was between the RLL and the SAA residues. It has always been assumed that this was the site based upon the amino acid sequence of the enzyme isolated from liver. The potential uncertainty comes about from the fact that human liver mitochondrial ALDH was reported to possess a ragged N-terminal sequence (35Hempel J. Kaiser R. Jörnvall H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and that rat and beef liver mitochondrial ALDH, isolated from fresh tissue, had a blocked N-terminal (acetylated) residue(36Weiner H. Cunningham S.C. Angelo R.A. Jörnvall H. Höög J.-O. Gustavsson A.-M. Methods in Protein Sequence Analysis. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1991: 161-167Crossref Google Scholar).The linker-deleted precursor was shown to direct the import of ALDH into isolated rat liver mitochondria, but was not removed by the action of the protease after import(7Thornton K. Wang Y. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19906-19914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding β-galactosidase fusion protein isolated from yeast mitochondria after import was found to be blocked and not processed. The blocking, presumed to be acetylation, could have occurred either after import or prior to import. It is not known whether or not the initiator methionine residue is removed in cytosol prior to import. Detailed structure analysis of the blocked precursor proteins by mass spectroscopic techniques could be used to address this question.Most investigators (37Sheffield W.P. Shore G.C. Randall S.K. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7421-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) argue that import is a post-translational event. There are some who have presented data which can be interpreted as implying that mitochondrial import is a co-translation event(15Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Verner K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1723-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our finding that the fusion proteins have been subjected to the action of a protease prior to import is supportive of the notion that import is a post-translational event. If the leader was entering mitochondria as it was coming off the ribosome it would be protected from the action of the cytosolic proteases. Similar import data were obtained when the multicopy plasmid or the single-copy plasmid were employed. This finding shows that proteolysis occurred independent of the rate of synthesis of the precursor protein and was not simply a result of protein being synthesized faster than it was being imported.The proteolysis observed in this study shows a potential difficulty in investigating import of fusion proteins in yeast. Investigators cannot really tell why import did not occur unless they were to sequence the protein remaining in the cytosol. Our study was performed only with β-galactosidase as the carrier protein. It is not possible to state why the ALDH portion was so susceptible to cleavage or why the leader was cleaved when fused directly to β-galactosidase. It is possible that using a protein which was imported slowly could have made it more susceptible to the action of nonspecific cytosolic proteases. A similar study will have to be undertaken using other proteins to determine if proteolysis is a problem common for all chimeric proteins expressed in yeast or is unique to the system employed in this study.Cellular fractionations and enzyme assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Imports are given as percentage of the total activity present in the combined fractions and calibrated by assaying for the marker enzymes. The numbers represent the average of at least two experiments. The experimental error was ±8% of the mean. INTRODUCTIONIt has been proposed that the leader sequences which allow precursor proteins to be transported into mitochondria contain amphilpathic helices(1von Heijine G.

The structure of three processed and three nonprocessed leaders sequences have been determined by two-dimensional NMR(6Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.M. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G.

The leader sequence for rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 1The abbreviations used are: ALDHaldehyde dehydrogenasepALDHprecursor aldehyde dehydrogenasemALDHmature aldehyde dehydrogenaseX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactosidebpbase pairkbkilobase pair. was found to be composed of three structural components(6Karslake C. Piotto M.E. Pak Y.M. Weiner H. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9872-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These were two short segments of α helices separated by a three-amino acid linker (RGP). We investigated the necessity of each region by making deletions or by constructing chimeric leader sequences with components of cytochrome oxidase, a protein whose leader sequence also was determined by two-dimensional NMR(8Endo T. Shinada F. Roise D. Inagaki R. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We concluded that the minimum structural requirement of the leader peptide was just a two-turn amphilpathic α helix at the N termini of the leader sequence(11Wang Y. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4759-4765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of the other portions of the leader was proposed to stabilize the N-terminal helix. The experiments that led to these conclusions were performed with isolated rat liver mitochondria employing proteins synthesized in rabbit reticulocytes. Data obtained from in vitro import studies are thought to represent what occurs in vivo because the cytosolic factors necessary to allow import to occur are supplied by the reticulocyte system. We felt it would be advantageous to investigate the peptides in a true in vivo system, rather than just the in vitro one employed, to verify our observations.Investigators have often used yeast to study import(12Emr S.D.

Emr S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3983-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Leader sequences were fused to carrier proteins in order to ascertain residues in the leader important for import. A common carrier protein employed is β-galactosidase because of the ease of assaying the enzyme. Typically, mitochondria are separated from cytosol, and the amount of β-galactosidase activity in each organelle is used as a measure of import. The leader sequence from rat liver aldehyde dehydrogenase and an altered sequence we employed in the in vitro studies were fused to β-galactosidase on a yeast expression vector to test whether the observations made in the in vitro system were valid in vivo. It will be shown that the fusion of the leader sequence directly to β-galactosidase produced a protein that was poorly imported. In contrast, if some residues of the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase were included, then the protein could be imported into mitochondria, but much of the fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm."

To test if mammalian DTR is able to confer toxin sensitivity onto phylogenetically distant cells, we expressed monkey DTR in the baculovirus system and tested infected insect cells for toxin sensitivity. cDNA encoding an epitope-tagged heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor precursor (DTRB3) was inserted into the virus genome by allelic replacement to construct the recombinant virus vAc-DTRB3. SF9 cells infected with vAc-DTRB3 expressed functional DTR, which could be precipitated from the solubilized membrane fraction of infected cells with Sepharose-immobilized diphtheria toxin. The highest level of expression (about 5 × 106 receptors/cell) was observed 48 h after infection, at which time the infected cells were highly sensitive to diphtheria toxin. Uninfected SF9 cells and cells infected with the wild type virus were resistant to the toxin. The presence of heparin increased both the binding and the toxin sensitivity of vAc-DTRB3-infected SF9 cells. Translocation of toxin A fragment was induced when cells with surface-bound toxin were exposed to low pH, and the translocation was optimal at pH ≤5.5. It was ∼100 times more efficient at 24°C than at 4°C. The data indicate that monkey DTR is fully functional when expressed in insect cells.

The low pH environment in the endosomes induces a conformational change in the B fragment, and the enzymatically active A fragment is translocated to the cytosol(7Papini E. Sandoná D. Rappuoli R.

While cells of human and monkey origin are in general sensitive to DT to varying extent, cells from rats and mice are toxin resistant(14Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The variation in sensitivity of different cells appears to be largely due to differences in the number of DTRs(15Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Leppla S.H. J. Biol.

Other factors have been implicated, such as different affinity of the receptors for the toxin and the presence of additional proteins associated with the receptor, that could play a role in the translocation process(18Naglich J.G. Rolf J.M. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2170-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Brown J.G. Almond B.D. Naglich J.G. Eidels L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transfection of DTR has been shown to confer toxin sensitivity onto mouse cells that are normally resistant to the toxin. It is not clear if DTR alone is required for toxin translocation or if other proteins, such as CD9, are also required. We therefore decided to test if monkey DTR can confer sensitivity onto a cell of non-vertebrate origin, as the possibility of correct interaction with any required additional membrane proteins was considered to be much lower in these cells than in mammalian cells. We chose to express DTR in the baculovirus system. This system utilizes insect cells that can be infected with the naturally occurring baculovirus AcNPV. During lytic infection, the gene product for the baculovirus polyhedrin is expressed in high amounts and can account for about 50% of the total cellular protein(20Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; : 1555Google Scholar). The polyhedrin gene is not essential for production of infectious virions. Therefore, expression vectors that use the strong AcNPV polyhedrin promoter to drive expression of foreign genes have been developed(21Smith G.E. Fraser M.J. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1983; 46: 584-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using this approach, large amounts of eukaryotic proteins have been successfully produced, including a variety of receptors. In addition, insect cells can perform many of the post-translational modifications carried out by higher eukaryotes (for review see Ref. 22). These features make the baculovirus system an attractive choice for large scale production of normal and mutant DTRs, as recently reported by Ono et al.(23Ono M. Raab G. Lau K. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31315-31321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological activity as DTR in the infected cells was not tested by these authors. In the present work, we have studied the expression of DTR by SF9 and HF cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. We have made a construct with an epitope (B3, against which we have an antibody) added to the COOH-terminal (cytoplasmic) end of the receptor to allow immunoprecipitation from lysed cells. Expression of the DTRB3 in COS cells2 2E. M. Valdizan, E. V. Loukianov, and S. Olsnes, unpublished data. showed that the presence of this epitope does not impair the ability of DTR to ensure binding and translocation of the toxin. [35S]Methionine, 1-[3,4,5,-3H]leucine, and 125I were purchased from DuPont NEN. Pronase E (from Streptomyces griseus), trypsin (TPCK-treated), PMSF, N-ethylmaleimide, heparin (sodium salt grade 1A from porcine intestinal mucosa), monensin, Nonidet P-40, sodium deoxycholate, dithiothreitol, Triton X-100, leupeptin, aprotinin, DNase, antipain, and X-gal were from Sigma. Chymostatin and pepstatin A were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Diphtheria toxin (crude) was purchased from Connaught Laboratories (Willowdale, Canada) and purified as described(9Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9068-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-A Sepharose and CNBr-Sepharose were from Pharmacia LKB (Uppsala, Sweden). Rabbit immune serum against the B3 peptide (GVNEYNEMPMPVN) was prepared by Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Cambridge, United Kingdom). The following buffers were used: PBS (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2); lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml DNase, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 10 IU/ml heparin); Hepes medium (bicarbonate- and serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium buffered with 20 mM Hepes at pH 7.4); low pH buffer for SF9 cells (TNM-FH medium plus 10 mM sodium gluconate adjusted to the indicated pH); low pH buffer for Vero cells (Hepes medium plus 10 mM sodium gluconate adjusted to the indicated pH). The insect cell line SF9 was obtained from Unni Spaeren (Tromsø, Norway), HF insect cells were purchased from InVitrogen Corp. (Oxon, UK). The cells were propagated in suspension at 27°C in TNM-FH Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10,000 IU/liter penicillin, and 10 mg/liter streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Uxbridge, UK). Wild type linearized AcNPV DNA and plasmid pBlueBacIII were purchased from InVitrogen. In the transfer vector, the cloning site downstream of the polyhedrin promoter and the LacZ gene are flanked by two recombinant sequences identical to sequences in the polyhedrin region of the AcNPV DNA. To construct the recombinant baculovirus expressing DTR (vAc-DTRB3), the 690-bp segment of the DNA corresponding to the monkey HB-EGF precursor with the COOH-terminal B3 epitope was cloned into the BamHI and PstI sites of the pBlueBacIII. 3 μg of plasmid DNA was cotransfected with 1 μg of linearized wild type AcNPV total viral DNA into 2.5 × 106 SF9 cells using cationic liposome-mediated transfection as indicated in the instructions from InVitrogen. A double crossover recombinant was insolated by the plaque purification method as described by O'Reilly et al.(22O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 216-240Google Scholar) by screening in the presence of X-gal for blue plaques with the occlusion body negative (polyhedrin negative) phenotype. The chosen plaques were tested by binding of 125I-labeled DT to infected cells, and those that showed high binding were tested by PCR for the total absence of any wild type AcNPV virus DNA. In the PCR, a band of about 800 bp is expected for the wild type viral DNA, whereas for the recombinant virus the expected band is about 1,300 bp. If contamination with the wild type viral DNA occurs or if the recombinant virus originated from a single crossover, two bands of about 800 and 1,300 bp appear upon PCR amplification. All the recombinants tested by PCR gave a single band of the expected size (1,300 bp), demonstrating that vAc-DTRB3 but not wild type viral DNA (800-bp band) was obtained. After confirmation, one recombinant was expanded to 3.108 plaque-forming units/ml by infecting SF9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 plaque-forming units/cell. For experiments, SF9 cells were infected with the wild type or the recombinant vAc-DTRB3 at a multiplicity of infection of about 20 plaque-forming units/cell or were mock infected with TNM-FH medium (SF9) for 1 h. Then, complete medium was added, and the infection was followed for the indicated periods of time (hpi). At 24, 48, and 72 hpi, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde, 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight in 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mM potassium ferricyanide, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 mg/ml X-gal. The reaction was stopped by washing twice with PBS, and the cells were observed under the microscope, screening the number and the intensity of blue cells. At 24, 48, and 72 hpi, HF cells adherent to poly-L-lysine-treated glass coverslip were washed with ice-cold PBS, and then 10 μg/ml DT was added and allowed to bind to the infected cells for 30 min at room temperature as described below. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and subsequently incubated with anti-DT antibodies and then with FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and the coverslip was mounted on a microscopy slide with Mowiol and examined under UV light. DT or nDT were labeled with 125I by the IODO-GEN method to a specific activity of about 1 × 105 cpm/ng as described(24Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). At 48 hpi, SF9 cells were incubated in binding medium (Grace's insect medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and with or without 10 IU/ml heparin as indicated) with increasing amounts of 125I-labeled DT in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by filtration through Whatman GF/A filters, which were then washed five times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was measured in an autogamma spectrometer. The specific binding was calculated as the difference between the radioactivity associated with the filters in the absence and presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT. The unspecific binding to cells infected with the recombinant virus varied from 10 to 40% of the total binding for different experiments, depending of the batch of labeled DT. The specific binding was plotted as described by Scatchard (25) to determine the number and the affinity of DT to the DTR. Binding curves were generated by regression analysis. Vero cells in 12-well plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 125I-labeled DT in Hepes medium plus 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT. The cells were then washed four times with PBS and lysed in 0.1 M KOH, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured. DT at a concentration of 1.1 mg/ml was nicked with 0.5 μg/ml trypsin for 30 min at 37°C; the reaction was stopped by adding 25 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. To assess the rate of protein synthesis, the incorporation of [3H]leucine into cellular proteins was measured at 36 or 48 hpi. Although maximum expression of DTR was at 48 hpi, for some of the toxicity experiments binding of the toxin was carried out at 36 hpi to allow the toxin to act overnight to produce maximal effect on protein synthesis without lysis of the cells. At the indicated hpi, the cells were recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g at room temperature and then washed with 10 ml of PBS. The cells were resuspended in binding medium and incubated with increasing amounts of nDT for 30 min at the indicated temperatures in the absence or presence of 10 μM of monensin. The medium and unbound toxin was removed, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer at the indicated pH for 5 min at 27°C to allow translocation of bound toxin to occur; then, 3 ml of complete TNM-FH medium with or without 10 μM monensin and anti-DT serum was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 27°C to allow the translocated toxin to inhibit protein synthesis. In some experiments, the low pH pulse was omitted. After the incubation, the cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed with 1 ml of leucine-free Grace medium and incubated in 1 ml of leucine-free Grace medium with 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and treated twice with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min; the pellets were recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1 M KOH, and the radioactivity was measured. Vero cells were incubated in binding medium with increasing amounts of nDT for 30 min at the indicated temperature in the absence or presence of 10 μM monensin as indicated. Medium and unbound toxin was washed away, and low pH buffer was added for 5 min at 37°C; then, 3 ml of complete medium (with or without 10 μM monensin and anti-DT serum) was added, and the cells were incubated or for 2 h at 37°C. The incorporation of [3H]leucine was then measured for 30 min at 37°C in leucine-free Hepes medium supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine. The cells were treated twice with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min and dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1 M KOH; the radioactivity was then measured. At 48 hpi, 100 ng of 125I-labeled nDT was bound to vAc-DTRB3-infected cells for 30 min at 4°C in presence of 10 μM monensin. Unbound toxin was removed by washing the cells five times with 10 ml of PBS. Then, the cells were exposed for 5 min to the indicated pH values at 27°C to allow translocation of the bound toxin to occur. The cells were incubated for 10 min at 27°C with 6 mg/ml Pronase E in the presence of 10 μM monensin and subsequently recovered by centrifugation for 3 min at 14,000 rpm. After washing with PBS containing 1 mMN-ethylmaleimide and 1 mM PMSF, the cells were lysed for 10 min in lysis buffer containing 1 mMN-ethylmaleimide and 1 mM PMSF on ice, and the nuclei were removed by centrifugation. Cellular proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellets were washed with ether and subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. At 48 hpi, uninfected SF9 cells, SF9AcNPV cells, and SF9DTR-B3 cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h and then lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 30 min on ice; the nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C, and the supernatant was used for DTR precipitation. For precipitation of DTR, 500 μl of cell lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4°C with DT-Sepharose or anti-B3 bound to protein-A-Sepharose. The pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with PBS, and once with water. They were then treated with sample buffer, and the extracted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. SDS-PAGE-SDS-PAGE was carried out in 12% gels. The gels were fixed in 4% (v/v) acetic acid, 27% (v/v) methanol for 30 min and then treated with 1 M sodium salicylate, pH 5.8, in 2% (v/v) glycerol for 30 min. To visualize proteins labeled with 125I or with [35S]methionine, dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films with intensifying screens at −80°C for fluorography. Recombinant baculovirus encoding the DTR gene was constructed by standard techniques and checked by PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To check the time course of the virus infection as well as the level of viral protein production, we first monitored the expression of the LacZ gene visualized by staining the insect cells with X-gal at different times post-infection. The number of blue cells and the intensity of the blue color reflect the amount of infected cells and the level of viral protein expression. By this method, we found that 24 hpi almost 90% of the vAc-DTRB3-infected cells were blue, whereas cells infected with wild type virus as well as uninfected SF9 cells remained colorless. At 48 and 72 hpi, 100% of the cells became blue, and also the intensity of the color was increased from 48 to 72 hpi, indicating an increase in the viral protein production (data not shown). About 72 hpi, virus-induced cell lysis starts. As the LacZ gene is produced from an earlier promoter (pEtl promotor) than that of polyhedrin, the X-gal staining of the cells indicates the progress in the virus infection but not the levels of DTR production. To test directly the expression of DTR, we monitored the ability of the transfected cells to bind 125I-labeled DT at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. The specific binding increased to a maximum at 48 hpi, and it was again lower at 72 hpi, probably due to beginning cell lysis. To visualize the expressed DTR by immunofluorescence, we used HF insect cells because these cells were attached more strongly to glass coverslips than SF9 cells. We allowed DT to bind to the cells, which were then incubated with antibodies against DT followed by an FITC-labeled second antibody (Fig. 1). No fluorescence was observed in uninfected cells or in cells infected with wild type virus. In cells infected with recombinant virus, it was possible to detect receptor expression at 24 hpi. The fraction of cells showing fluorescence and the intensity of the fluorescence increased with time from 24 to 48 hpi, whereas at 72 hpi it was not possible to stain the cells because of lysis. To immunoprecipitate the expressed receptors, we used an anti-B3 serum against the COOH-terminal epitope added to the receptor. We also precipitated the DTR with DT immobilized on Sepharose. As it is shown in Fig. 2(lanes 3 and 6), a band of about 25 kDa (arrow) was observed in both cases. When the DTR was precipitated with DT-Sepharose, the amount precipitated was much higher than in the case of immunoprecipitation with anti-B3 serum, indicating that the B3 epitope is either not well exposed or partly removed in the cells. Also, two additional bands of about 20 kDa (asterisks) were precipitated with DT-Sepharose (lane 6). These bands were not observed in uninfected SF9 cells (lanes 1 and 4) or in cells infected with wild type virus (lanes 2 and 5). We have in the following defined specific binding of DT as the difference in binding of 125I-labeled DT in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled toxin. In uninfected SF9 cells and cells infected with the wild type virus, only marginal binding was detected, indicating that the cells do not express appreciable amounts of receptors for diphtheria toxin. To measure DT binding to infected cells, we tested SF9 cells 48 h after the infection with vAc-DTRB3. HB-EGF constitutes part of DTR(26Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested if the presence of heparin in the binding medium affected the binding of DT to the receptor. Uninfected SF9 cells and vAc-DTRB3-infected cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml 125I-labeled DT and increasing amounts of heparin in the absence and presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT. The results (Fig. 3) showed that heparin induced a considerable increase in the amount of total binding in the vAc-DTRB3-infected cells but not in uninfected cells, indicating that the binding to the infected cells was of a different kind. The binding increased up to 10-20 IU/ml heparin and then decreased again with higher heparin concentrations. Compared to the increase seen in vAc-DTRB3-infected cells (Fig. 4A), there was only a small increase in the binding of 125I-labeled DT in presence of heparin in Vero cells (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Effect of heparin on the specific binding of 125I-labeled DT to vAc-DTRB3-infected SF9 cells (A) and Vero cells (B). Cells were incubated with increasing amounts of 125I-labeled DT in the absence and presence of 10 μg/ml unlabeled DT and 10 IU/ml heparin for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the insect cells were washed on Whatman GF/A filters with ice-cold PBS, and the radioactivity associated with the filters was measured. The Vero cells (growing on plastic) were washed with PBS and lysed in 0.1 M KOH, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured. The specific binding indicated on the ordinate was calculated as the difference between the radioactivity bound in absence and presence of unlabeled DT. ○, no heparin; ●, 10 IU/ml heparin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The vAc-DTRB3-infected cells were found to bind 125I-labeled DT in a highly specific and saturable manner (Fig. 5A). A single binding affinity (Kd of 3.7 × 10−8M) and 5 × 106 binding sites/cell were calculated. In comparison, Vero cells were found to express 22,000 receptors/cell with an affinity of 2.1 × 10−9M (Fig. 5B). After binding to DTR on toxin-sensitive cells, DT is normally endocytosed, and, upon acidification, the enzymatically active A fragment is translocated across the endosomal membrane(7Papini E.

Control experiments with uninfected cells showed that SF9 cells are resistant to diphtheria toxin, indicating the absence of functional receptors. Cells infected with the wild type virus were also resistant (data not shown). We tested the toxin sensitivity of vAc-DTRB3-infected cells and Vero cells under conditions where the toxin was bound to the cells for 30 min at 4°C, and then the cells were exposed to either neutral or low pH medium and incubated at neutral pH in the presence of monensin to inhibit toxin entry by the normal route. The rate of protein synthesis was measured 2 h later. When the low pH pulse was omitted, protein synthesis inhibition was not observed in either cell type (Fig. 6). In contrast, when cells with bound toxin were exposed to pH 4.8, protein synthesis in the vAc-DTRB3-infected SF9 cells was inhibited at very low toxin concentrations. Both Vero cells and vAc-DTRB3-infected insect cells were more sensitive to DT when incubated with the toxin over night to let the toxin be endocytosed and enter by the normal route than when the toxin entry was induced by acidification of the medium (Fig. 7, A and B).Figure 7:Comparison of sensitivity of vAc-DTRB3-infected SF9 cells (●) and Vero cells (○) to DT translocated from the plasma membrane at low pH (A) and from endosomes (B).

J., and Gómez-Puyou, A.(1993) Biochemistry 32, 2213-2218). By filtration techniques, it was determined that synthesized ATP and pyrophosphate are enzyme bound, albeit the affinity for pyrophosphate was lower than that of ATP. After ATP and pyrophosphate were formed in dimethyl sulfoxide mixtures, dilution with aqueous buffer to a dimethyl sulfoxide concentration of 6.0% brought about the partition of pyrophosphate into the media. This was evidenced by filtration experiments as well as by the accessibility of synthesized pyrophosphate to soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase. Release of pyrophosphate induced by dilution occurred in less than 15 s. Under conditions that produce release of pyrophosphate, no release of ATP was observed; instead, ATP underwent hydrolysis. Studies on the effect of arsenate on the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP and PPi in F1 showed that hydrolysis of synthesized PPi at its site of synthesis was slower than that of ATP. Thus, the question of whether differences in the rates of hydrolysis accounted for the dilution-induced release of PPi but not of ATP was addressed. Synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP and pyrophosphate were examined in preparations of soluble F1 in complex with its inhibitor protein; the complex had an ATPase activity about 100 times lower than that of free F1. In mixtures that contained dimethyl sulfoxide, the complex synthesized ATP and pyrophosphate at nearly the same rates; upon dilution, hydrolysis of both compounds occurred also at similar rates, yet only pyrophosphate was released. The same phenomenon was observed in F1 that had been depleted of adenine nucleotides. Hence, dilution-induced release of PPi was independent of the overall catalytic properties of the enzyme or its content of adenine nucleotides. Since synthesis of ATP occurs at the expense of the ADP that remains after depletion of adenine nucleotides, it is likely that the failure of ATP to be released is due to the high affinity that F1 exhibits for the synthesized ATP. Nevertheless, the results illustrate that a complete catalytic cycle that starts with medium Pi and ends with medium pyrophosphate may be reproduced in soluble mitochondrial F1. Soluble F1 from heart mitochondria incubated in mixtures that have Mg2+, inorganic phosphate, and dimethyl sulfoxide (40% (v/v)) catalyzes the spontaneous synthesis of ATP and pyrophosphate (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou, M., Garca, J.

Nevertheless, the results illustrate that a complete catalytic cycle that starts with medium Pi and ends with medium pyrophosphate may be reproduced in soluble mitochondrial F1. In the energy-transducing membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the plasma membrane of bacteria, the H+-ATP synthase catalyzes the synthesis of medium ATP from medium ADP and Pi utilizing the energy of electrochemical proton gradients derived from electron transport (for reviews see 16Futai M.T. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar; 28Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar). The same basic process occurs in the light-driven synthesis of PPi from Pi by a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase in chromatophores of Rhodospirillum rubrum (5Baltscheffsky H. van Stedingk L.V. Heldt H.W. Klingenbgerg M. Science. 1966; 153: 1120-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The catalytic moiety for ATP synthesis of the ATP synthase is F1; this may be detached from the membrane as a soluble multisubunit protein. Soluble F1 can also be obtained (19Gómez-Puyou A. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou A. de Meis L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) in complex with the inhibitor protein of 29Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. F1 has six adenine nucleotide binding sites (Penefsky and Cross, 1991); pyrophosphate may bind to some of these sites (22Issartel J.P. Fabre-Bulle O. Lunardi J. Vignais P.V. J. Biol.

It has also been shown that a synthesized peptide based on the amino acid sequence of F1 has the capacity to bind PPi (17Garboczi D.N. Shenbagamurthi P. Kirk W. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol.

More recently, it was found that soluble F1 incubated in Me2SO also has the capacity to form PPi (34Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Garca J.J. Gómez-Puyou A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In consonance with the observation that ATP and PPi are formed spontaneously in the presence of Me2SO, studies on the rate and equilibrium constants of the steps of the catalytic cycle in F1 showed that at the active center of F1, the equilibrium constant for ATP hydrolysis is close to one (20Grubmeyer C.

In the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, it was observed that in mixtures with Me2SO, Pi may phosphorylate the aspartate that lies at its catalytic site (15de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); this in turn may yield medium ATP upon transfer of the phosphorylated enzyme to aqueous media that contain ADP. It is also known that in presence of Me2SO, soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase catalyzes synthesis of medium PPi (13de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6090-6097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The findings with the Ca2+ ATPase and soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase illustrate that changes of the aqueous environment result in formation of medium ATP and PPi. As noted, the spontaneous synthesis of ATP in F1 incubated with Me2SO is well documented; however, the factors that control its partition into the media have not been explored in sufficient detail. The studies are of importance, since it has been proposed that during oxidative phosphorylation, release of ATP into the media is an energy-requiring step (11Boyer P.D. Cross R.L. Momsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2837-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar; 21Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

Thus, studies on the release of spontaneously formed ATP and/or PPi may be particularly relevant as they may shed light on the mechanisms that operate in the transformation of the energy of electrochemical H+ gradients into that of medium ATP or PPi. Here, we studied the factors that may be involved in the hydrolysis and/or release of ATP and PPi that had been formed spontaneously in soluble mitochondrial F1 after incubation in Me2SO. The results show that in a Me2SO to water transition, PPi is ejected into the media. Thus, synthesis of medium PPi from medium Pi was achieved in the absence of electrochemical H+ gradients. In contrast, under a number of conditions the enzyme failed to release spontaneously formed ATP. The results suggest that at least with PPi, solvation is central in the events that lead to formation of “high energy” bonds in aqueous media. All nonradioactive chemicals were from Sigma. [32P]Phosphate was from DuPont NEN; it was purified as described elsewhere (de Meis, 1984). F1 was prepared from bovine heart submitochondrial particles as described before (33Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M. Gómez-Puyou A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 90: 147-149Google Scholar) and stored at 4°C in 50% ammonium sulfate that also contained 1 mM ATP and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; F1 in complex with the inhibitor was purified from submitochondrial particles whose ATPase was controlled by the inhibitor protein as described elsewhere (Gómez-Puyou et al., 1986). Prior to the experiments, free F1 and F1-IP were centrifuged through Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with 40 mM MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8 (24Kasahara M. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar using bovine serum albumin as standard. Spontaneous synthesis of ATP and PPi was determined as previously described (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). F1 was incubated at concentrations that ranged between 2.2 and 2.9 μM in 40 mM MOPS, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM [32P]Pi, and 40% Me2SO (by volume), pH 6.8. The specific activity of [32P]Pi was around 2 × 105 cpm/nmol. Generally, the volume of the incubation mixture was 250 μl, except in experiments in which 250-μl aliquots were withdrawn at various incubation times; it is referred to as standard synthetic mixture. Variations in the composition of the mixture are detailed under “Results.” Temperature was 30°C, except in the experiments with the F1-inhibitor protein complex, in which the temperature was 25°C. Synthesized radioactive ATP and PPi was determined as previously described (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993) with a few variations. The reaction was arrested with 6.0% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). This was followed by addition of 500 μM nonradioactive ATP and PPi. To the mixture, 0.5 ml of 3.3% ammonium molybdate in 3.75 N H2SO4 was added. Thereafter, 1 ml of water-saturated isobutanol/benzene (1:1 by volume) was added followed by vigorous stirring. After phase separation, the organic phase was removed. To the water phase, 20 μl of 20 mM nonradioactive Pi was added and extracted again with isobutanol/benzene. This step was repeated four times, but in the last two extractions, 20 and 10 μl of 100 mM nonradioactive Pi were added. After the last extraction, most of the ammonium molybdate had been removed. The methodology to determine the amount of radioactive [32P]Pi incorporated into ATP and PPi was as follows. The extract obtained above was neutralized to pH 7.0-7.5. Two equal aliquots of the mixture were withdrawn. One received 1 unit of soluble yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase and was incubated for 30 min. At this time, 0.5 ml of ammonium molybdate in H2SO4 was added to the two aliquots and extracted three times with isobutanol/benzene. The radioactivity of the water phase was determined. The difference in radioactivity between the samples that had or had not received soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase was considered to correspond to pyrophosphate synthesized by F1. As shown before (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993), radioactivity insensitive to pyrophosphatase activity corresponds to [γ32P]ATP. Blanks for every experimental condition were made; these were reaction mixtures that had no F1; they were treated as the experimental. In various experiments, after radioactive ATP and PPi were formed by F1, the synthetic mixture was either centrifuged (Kasahara and Penefsky, 1978) through Sephadex columns equilibrated with the synthetic mixture that contained nonradioactive Pi and 30% Me2SO or filtered through Centricon 10 filters (Amicon). In other experiments, the synthetic reaction mixture was diluted with 6 volumes of all aqueous 40 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. In this case, the diluted mixture was filtered through Centricon filters, and radioactive ATP and PPi were determined in the filtrate; alternatively, after dilution, 6.0% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) was added at various times, and the extraction procedure described above was followed to determine radioactive ATP and PPi. In confirmation of previous data (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993), soluble mitochondrial F1 incubated in media that contained Pi, Mg2+, and 40% Me2SO catalyzed the spontaneous formation of ATP and PPi (Table I). Concerning the characteristics of ATP and PPi synthesized by F1, it was relevant to ascertain if the totality or only a portion of the ATP and PPi formed was enzyme bound. The mixture in which the enzyme had been allowed to form ATP and PPi was passed through centrifuge columns filled with Sephadex G-50. The ratio of ATP and PPi per enzyme was determined before and after centrifuge column elution (Table I). The amount of ATP bound per enzyme was of a similar extent in the two fractions; hence, synthesized ATP was enzyme bound. On the other hand, the amount of PPi per F1 was lower in the eluate, which indicated that either a fraction of the synthesized PPi was medium PPi or that a portion of the enzyme-bound PPi was released during passage through centrifuge columns.Table I:Distribution of synthesized ATP and PPi between F1 and medium Open table in a new tab The whole reaction mixture was also centrifuged over Centricon filters; this procedure effectively separated the enzyme from the media under conditions in which F1 was always in contact with the media. In the filtrate, no ATP or PPi were detected (Table I). Taken together, the results indicated that synthesized ATP and PPi remained bound to F1. However, the affinity of F1 for PPi was lower than that for ATP, since a fraction of bound PPi was lost upon passage through Sephadex centrifuge columns. At concentrations of Me2SO below 10% and concentrations of Pi in the range of 2 mM, synthesis of ATP and PPi is hardly detectable (Sakamoto and Tonomura, 1983; Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). Hence, the effect of diluting with aqueous buffer the 40% Me2SO synthetic mixture in which soluble F1 had been allowed to form ATP and PPi was studied. In agreement with previous data (Sakamoto and Tonomura, 1983; Gómez-Puyou et al., 1986), it was observed that dilution of the reaction mixture with 6 volumes of aqueous buffer brought about the breakdown of ATP (Table II, Exp. A). In over ten experiments, after 1 h of dilution, between 50 and 80% of the ATP was hydrolyzed. In contrast, in the same number of experiments, it was observed that in 1 h after dilution at least 80% of the synthesized PPi remained in the mixture (, Exp. A).Table II:Effect of dilution on synthesized ATP and PPi Open table in a new tab As noted, one of the questions addressed here was if a change in solvent composition brought about partition of ATP and/or PPi from their site of synthesis into the media. To this purpose, F1 was allowed to form ATP and PPi in the standard synthetic mixture. Thereafter, the mixture was diluted and passed through Centricon filters; in the filtrate, ATP and PPi were determined. (Exp. B) shows that a substantial amount of radioactive PPi appeared in the filtrate. Thus, dilution brought about partition of synthesized PPi into the aqueous media. However, only a fraction of the total PPi (about 70%) appeared in the filtrate. The experiment of Fig. 1 was an attempt to determine the time required for release of synthesized PPi from F1 after a Me2SO to water transition. F1 that had been allowed to form PPi was diluted with aqueous buffer that contained inorganic pyrophosphatase. Within 15 s, almost the totality of the synthesized PPi disappeared from the system. These results, together with the data obtained from the filtration experiments that show that only a portion of the total PPi formed is released by dilution, indicate that full release of PPi took place in less than 15 s, provided the equilibrium between enzyme-bound and free PPi is shifted by hydrolysis of the latter. In contrast to PPi, no ATP was detected in the Centricon filtrate. In this respect, it is noted that filtration took between 45 and 60 min. Since ATP is gradually hydrolyzed after dilution, it was considered that ATP may have been released and hydrolyzed prior to its removal from the whole reaction mixture. However, when the synthetic mixture was diluted with aqueous buffer that contained hexokinase + glucose2 2When hexokinase was added, the totality of [32P]Pi incorporated into ATP, and PPi disappeared. This is because hexokinase (Sigma type IV) at the concentration used exhibits substantial pyrophosphatase activity (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). (activity in excess over that of the ATPase activity of F1), there was disappearance of non-extractable [32P]Pi (see “Materials and Methods”). If ATP had been released, it would have been trapped by hexokinase yielding nonextractable glucose 6-phosphate. Thus, dilution did not cause release of ATP from F1 from the enzyme into media, albeit it brought about partition of PPi. The different behavior that ATP and PPi exhibited in the aforementioned Me2SO to water transition could be used to ascertain the factors that control their release or hinder their partition into the media. At their site of synthesis, ATP and PPi could follow two competing pathways: hydrolysis or partition into the media. In principle, the pathway that either of the two compounds can follow would depend on the relative rates of the two reactions. Hence, it was necessary to ascertain the relative rates of hydrolysis of the two compounds at their site of synthesis. In this regard, it is noted that Kandpal et al.(1987) and Al-Shawi and Senior(1988, 1992) showed that in presence of Me2SO, synthesized ATP undergoes reversible hydrolysis. For a long time it has been known that arsenate competes with Pi in oxidative phosphorylation, and it was described that it may arsenylate ADP yielding an unstable analog of ATP (12Crane R.K. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 201: 235-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, arsenate was used to study whether ATP and PPi undergo reversible hydrolysis at the catalytic site. Prior to these studies, synthesis of ATP and PPi were determined at various Pi concentrations. Lower concentrations were required for ATP than for PPi synthesis (Fig. 2). For example, substantial formation of ATP was observed with 0.5 mM Pi, a concentration at which PPi synthesis was not detected. With 2.0 mM Pi, 5 mM arsenate produced almost complete inhibition of ATP and PPi synthesis (open triangles in Fig. 3). The figure also shows that in 3 and 5 h of incubation, the level of synthesized ATP remained fairly constant. However, when arsenate was added to the enzyme that had been allowed to form ATP for 3 h (time zero in Fig. 3), there was a progressive decrease in the level of radioactive ATP. This indicated that at the catalytic site, synthesized ATP underwent reversible hydrolysis and that arsenate diminished the rate of the forward reaction; otherwise, the level of ATP that existed at the time of arsenate addition would have remained constant. With PPi, different results were obtained (Fig. 3). In the absence of arsenate, the amount of synthesized PPi increased in the 3-5-h incubation time (in all time curves we have carried out with F1, synthesis of PPi continues for times longer than those with ATP, i.e. synthesis of ATP levels off at around 1 h, whereas that of PPi continues to increase even after 6 h). The addition of arsenate to F1 that had been allowed to form PPi produced a rather slow decrease in the pre-existing level of PPi. In fact, no effect of arsenate on PPi levels was observed after 90 min of arsenate addition; a moderate decrease was observed only after 2 h. The latter indicates that under synthetic conditions, and similarly to ATP, there is continuous synthesis and hydrolysis of PPi at the catalytic center but that its rate of hydrolysis is slower than that of ATP. The results with arsenate raised the possibility that hindrances in hydrolysis of PPi at its site of synthesis could be related to its release upon dilution, conversely that the higher rate of hydrolysis of synthesized ATP could account for a predominance of the hydrolytic pathway. To address the problem, a system in which hydrolysis of PPi and ATP took place at equivalent rates was looked for. To this purpose, we examined the process of synthesis of ATP and PPi in soluble F1 when in complex with the natural ATPase inhibitor of Pullman and Monroy, 1963). The complex (F1-IP) can be prepared from submitochondrial particles that have their ATPase controlled by its inhibitor protein (Gómez-Puyou et al., 1986); it exhibits a hydrolytic activity about 100 times lower than that of free F1. It was found that F1-IP has the capacity to synthesize ATP and PPi at nearly equal rates (Fig. 4). When the synthetic mixture was diluted, the two compounds were hydrolyzed; however, it is relevant that the breakdown of ATP and PPi occurred at rather similar velocities (Fig. 4). This was a fortunate circumstance, since with F1-IP, the question of whether at equivalent rates of hydrolysis and synthesized ATP and PPi followed the same or different pathways upon dilution could be addressed. F1-IP was allowed to synthesize radioactive ATP and PPi in standard incubation mixtures and was subsequently diluted. The presence of ATP and PPi in the media was examined by filtration and enzyme-trapping experiments (Table III). As evidenced by the appearance of PPi in Centricon filtrates and its accessibility to inorganic pyrophosphatase, PPi was released into the media. On the other hand, no evidence that indicated release of ATP was observed.Table III:Effect of dilution on ATP and PPi synthesized by F1 in complex with its inhibitor protein Open table in a new tab It is also noted that dilution with aqueous buffer that contained 3 mM of ATP, ADP, or ITP did not produce release of synthesized ATP from F1-IP; also, it was observed that the presence of the nucleotides did not affect the dilution-induced release of PPi (not shown). As previously described, F1 that has a low content of adenine nucleotides (0.4 mol of ADP and less than 0.1 mol of ATP/mol F1) synthesizes ATP and PPi (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). Adenine nucleotide-depleted F1 was allowed to to synthesize 0.03 ATP and 0.04 PPi per F1 in mixtures with 30% Me2SO in a 2-h incubation time (these conditions were used to avoid inactivation of adenine nucleotide-depleted F1, which is labile in mixtures with 40% Me2SO; see Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). Upon dilution, only PPi was released. The results with this preparation are interesting in the sense that they indicate 1) that the nucleotide content of F1 does not affect ATP or PPi release and 2) that synthesis of ATP takes place with the ADP that remains in the enzyme after adenine nucleotide depletion (in other words, with the ADP that is bound to F1 with the highest affinity). Research that has spanned for more than 3 decades has yielded important information on the subunit composition, kinetics, control, and structure of the whole ATP synthase and soluble F1. Moreover, the crystallographic structure of soluble F1 has been described by two independent groups of researchers (10Bianchet M. Ysern X. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. Amzel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21197-21201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; 1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). Regardless of these extensive studies, the basic question of how energy of electrochemical H+ gradients is transformed into high energy pyrophosphate bonds in the medium has not yet been unveiled. In this context, it is relevant that at the catalytic center of the ATP synthase, the equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis, is close to one. In consonance with these observations is that spontaneous synthesis of ATP and PPi may take place in soluble F1, provided the mixture contains a cosolvent that favors the partition of Pi into the catalytic site (Tuena de Gómez-Puyou et al., 1993). Thus, the part of the catalytic cycle that leads to formation of enzyme-bound ATP has been reproduced in the soluble enzyme. The second part of the whole catalytic cycle, i.e. the release of spontaneously formed pyrophosphate bonds into the solvent that surrounds soluble F1, has proved more elusive. In fact, the present work shows that under a number of conditions and using F1 with different nucleotide composition and markedly different ATPase activities, no formation of medium ATP was observed. On the other hand, this work shows that in soluble F1 with different characteristics, formation of medium PPi from medium Pi could be readily achieved. Synthesis of medium PPi involved two steps. The first was the spontaneous formation of PPi at a catalytic site in F1 at the expense of medium Pi in presence of Me2SO. The second involved a transition from the Me2SO media to a nearly all aqueous mixture; this resulted in the ejection of PPi into the media. Hence, a whole catalytic cycle that started with medium Pi and ended with a high energy phosphate bond in aqueous media could be reproduced in the absence of electrochemical H+ gradients. Spontaneous formation of medium PPi from medium Pi has been observed before; soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase incubated in Me2SO catalyzes the synthesis of medium PPi in amounts larger than enzyme (de Meis, 1984). This was a consequence of a change in the equilibrium constant of PPi hydrolysis, which in Me2SO media has a less negative free energy of hydrolysis than in all aqueous mixtures (14de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 339-349Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The presently described synthesis of either enzyme bound or medium PPi was less than one per F1. Thus, although F1 has the catalytic properties to synthesize and hydrolyze PPi, and the conditions in Me2SO mixtures were thermodynamically favorable for formation of medium PPi, the catalytic cycle in F1 stopped with PPi at the catalytic center. In the light of the data with soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase, it may be inferred that release of PPi from F1 into the media of synthetic mixtures is not hindered by energetic barriers but rather by kinetic barriers. Of particular relevance is that in F1, these barriers are overcome by exposing the enzyme to more aqueous environment. In consequence, it would seem that solvation of F1 bears strongly on the magnitude of the kinetic barriers that lead to release of synthesized PPi. Regarding the question of why in F1, PPi but not ATP is released in a Me2SO to water transition, the results with different F1 preparations show that the difference cannot be ascribed to different catalytic rates or occupancy of adenine nucleotide binding sites. Hence, it is possible that release of ATP and PPi involve different mechanisms. However, on the assumption that solvation of F1 also bears on ATP release, it is likely that differences in partition between ATP and PPi are due to their different chemical structure, and thus they would have different affinity for the catalytic site. The crystal structure of F1 reveals that the adenine group of the ATP molecule interacts with various residues of the catalytic sites (Abrahams et al., 1994). Since these interactions do not occur with PPi, it is possible that the higher number of points with which ATP interacts confers a higher stability of ATP at the catalytic site. F1 from Escherichia coli that has been depleted of adenine nucleotides exhibits reversible synthesis of ATP at the catalytic site with the same rate constants as native F1 (32Senior A.E. Lee R.S.F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, it is relevant that in heart adenine nucleotide-depleted F1, ATP synthesis occurred at the expense of the ADP that remained bound; this implies that the ADP with the highest affinity was the species phosphorylated. Hence, it is possible that at that site, F1 continued to exhibit a high affinity for the synthesized ATP. In fact, it has been reported (Senior et al., 1992; 3Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that at the catalytic site of F1 from E. coli, the Kd for Mg-ATP is 10−10 in aqueous media. Formation of medium ATP from medium Pi and ADP in the absence of ion gradients was first described with the Ca2+ of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (de Meis et al., 1980). Changes in solvent were instrumental in such synthesis (formation of acyl-phosphate by medium Pi in presence of Me2SO and subsequent synthesis of ATP upon transfer of the phosphorylated enzyme to aqueous media that contained ADP). Hence, and particularly in the light of the solvent-induced release of PPi from F1, it is worthwhile to consider if solvation of F1 forms part of the overall mechanism that operates during coupled electron transport in energy-transducing membranes. F1 was incubated for 4 h at a concentration of 2.4 μM in the synthetic reaction media. It formed the amount of [32P]ATP or PPi indicated. At that time, an aliquot was passed through Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns equilibrated with the same mixture, except that it contained nonradioactive Pi, and the concentration of Me2SO was 30%. In the eluate, protein and the amount of [32P] incorporated into ATP and PPi was determined. At the same time, an aliquot of the synthetic reaction mixture was applied to Centricon filters, and the media separated from the enzyme. No ATP or PPi were detected in the filtrate (ND). Filtration through Centricon filters took 2 h. In experiment A, F1 (2.4 μM) was allowed to synthesize ATP and PPi for 4 h to the levels shown (time zero in the experiment). At this time, the mixture was diluted with 6 volumes of totally aqueous buffer (40 mM MOPS, pH 7.0). After dilution, aliquots were withdrawn at various times for assay of ATP and PPi. In B, after F1 (2.3 μM) had been allowed to form the indicated amounts of ATP and PPi for 4 h (time zero), the mixture was diluted with 6 volumes of aqueous buffer, and an aliquot was placed on Centricon filters and centrifuged for 45 min. At this time, ATP and PPi were determined in the whole diluted mixture and in the filtrate (ND, not detectable). The results are expressed as nmol [32P]Pi incorporated into ATP or PPi per ml of original synthetic mixture. F1 in complex with its inhibitor protein (3.2 μM) was incubated in the standard synthetic mixture for 4 h. The amount of ATP and PPi formed were determined. At this time, the mixture was diluted with aqueous buffer, and an aliquot was centrifuged over Centricon filters (1 h). The amount of ATP and PPi were determined in both the diluted mixture that had not been centrifuged and in the filtrate. After 4 h, the synthetic mixture was also diluted with aqueous buffer that contained inorganic pyrophosphatase; after 5 min, the reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of ATP and PPi was determined. ND, not detected. The results are expressed per ml of original synthetic mixture."
