https://openalex.org/W2773134645,"Progress towards the integration of technology into living organisms requires electrical power sources that are biocompatible, mechanically flexible, and able to harness the chemical energy available inside biological systems. Conventional batteries were not designed with these criteria in mind. The electric organ of the knifefish Electrophorus electricus (commonly known as the electric eel) is, however, an example of an electrical power source that operates within biological constraints while featuring power characteristics that include peak potential differences of 600 volts and currents of 1 ampere. Here we introduce an electric-eel-inspired power concept that uses gradients of ions between miniature polyacrylamide hydrogel compartments bounded by a repeating sequence of cation- and anion-selective hydrogel membranes. The system uses a scalable stacking or folding geometry that generates 110 volts at open circuit or 27 milliwatts per square metre per gel cell upon simultaneous, self-registered mechanical contact activation of thousands of gel compartments in series while circumventing power dissipation before contact. Unlike typical batteries, these systems are soft, flexible, transparent, and potentially biocompatible. These characteristics suggest that artificial electric organs could be used to power next-generation implant materials such as pacemakers, implantable sensors, or prosthetic devices in hybrids of living and non-living systems."
https://openalex.org/W2774621611,"Geophysical and geological data reveal increased ice-sheet variability and surface meltwater—possibly analogous to future conditions—offshore of the Aurora subglacial basin of East Antarctica during warm climate intervals of the past 50 million years. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet contains the water equivalent of approximately 50 metres of sea-level rise. Understanding the past behaviour of this mass of ice is therefore of much interest in times of a rapidly warming climate. Sean Gulick, Amelia Shevenell and colleagues show that the Aurora subglacial basin of East Antarctica had marine-terminating glaciers by the early to middle Eocene epoch. Over millions of years, the amount of ice in the area repeatedly waxed and waned, but then stabilized by the cooler late Miocene and even through the warmth of the Pliocene. The study's geochemical and radar data suggest that the combination of warmer temperatures and increased surface meltwater—conditions that will possibly occur again in the future—influenced past ice sheet retreats. Antarctica’s continental-scale ice sheets have evolved over the past 50 million years1,2,3,4. However, the dearth of ice-proximal geological records5,6,7,8 limits our understanding of past East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) behaviour and thus our ability to evaluate its response to ongoing environmental change. The EAIS is marine-terminating and grounded below sea level within the Aurora subglacial basin, indicating that this catchment, which drains ice to the Sabrina Coast, may be sensitive to climate perturbations9,10,11. Here we show, using marine geological and geophysical data from the continental shelf seaward of the Aurora subglacial basin, that marine-terminating glaciers existed at the Sabrina Coast by the early to middle Eocene epoch. This finding implies the existence of substantial ice volume in the Aurora subglacial basin before continental-scale ice sheets were established about 34 million years ago1,2,3,4. Subsequently, ice advanced across and retreated from the Sabrina Coast continental shelf at least 11 times during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. Tunnel valleys12 associated with half of these glaciations indicate that a surface-meltwater-rich sub-polar glacial system existed under climate conditions similar to those anticipated with continued anthropogenic warming10,11. Cooling since the late Miocene13 resulted in an expanded polar EAIS and a limited glacial response to Pliocene warmth in the Aurora subglacial basin catchment14,15,16. Geological records from the Sabrina Coast shelf indicate that, in addition to ocean temperature, atmospheric temperature and surface-derived meltwater influenced East Antarctic ice mass balance under warmer-than-present climate conditions. Our results imply a dynamic EAIS response with continued anthropogenic warming and suggest that the EAIS contribution to future global sea-level projections10,11,15,17 may be under-estimated."

In plant-beneficial bacteria, this pathway has been shown to suppress the growth of bacterial pathogens; however, the identification and mode of action of T6SS effector proteins that mediate this protective effect remain poorly defined. Here, we identify two previously uncharacterized effectors required for interbacterial antagonism by the plant commensal bacterium Pseudomonas protegens. Consistent with the established effector-immunity paradigm for antibacterial T6SS substrates, the toxic activities of these effectors are neutralized by adjacently encoded cognate immunity determinants. Although one of these effectors, RhsA, belongs to the family of DNase enzymes, the activity of the other was not apparent from its sequence. To determine the mechanism of toxicity of this latter effector, we determined its 1.3 Å crystal structure in complex with its immunity protein and found that it resembles NAD(P)+-degrading enzymes. In line with this structural similarity, biochemical characterization of this effector, termed Tne2 (Type VI secretion NADase effector family 2), demonstrates that it possesses potent NAD(P)+ hydrolase activity. Tne2 is the founding member of a widespread family of interbacterial NADases predicted to transit not only the Gram-negative T6SS but also the Gram-positive type VII secretion system, a pathway recently implicated in interbacterial competition among Firmicutes. Together, this work identifies new T6SS effectors employed by a plant commensal bacterium to antagonize its competitors and broadly implicates NAD(P)+-hydrolyzing enzymes as substrates of interbacterial conflict pathways found in diverse bacterial phyla.

The antibacterial properties of the T6SS are due to the toxic activities of secreted effector proteins. These effectors degrade conserved molecules required for cell viability, including cell wall peptidoglycan, membrane phospholipids, and chromosomal DNA (10Durand E. Cambillau C. Cascales E.

Intracellular intoxication and intoxication of sister cells are prevented by the existence of cognate immunity proteins, which directly bind to and inhibit the activity of their associated effector (11Russell A.B.

Effectors transit the T6SS through physical association with one of two families of secreted structural T6SS apparatus proteins. Large, multidomain effectors interact with members of the valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) family of proteins, whereas small, single-domain effectors associate with the lumen of ring-shaped haemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) (12Whitney J.C.

The former of these two effector groups often contains conserved N-terminal adaptor domains that facilitate their physical interaction with VgrG (15Bondage D.D. Lin J.S. Ma L.S. Kuo C.H. Lai E.M.

VgrG and PAAR proteins define distinct versions of a functional type VI secretion system.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 (27352036): e100573510.1371/journal.ppat.1005735Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cone-shaped PAAR domain possesses a flat hydrophobic surface at its base that strongly associates with a highly complementary surface at the C terminus of VgrG proteins (17Shneider M.M. Buth S.A. Ho B.T. Basler M. Mekalanos J.J. Leiman P.G.

Pseudomonas fluorescens and other closely related plant-associated bacteria are well known for their ability to both promote plant growth and suppress pathogens (18Weller D.M. Pseudomonas biocontrol agents of soilborne pathogens: looking back over 30 years.Phytopathology. 2007; 97 (18944383): 250-25610.1094/PHYTO-97-2-0250Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Pathogen suppression by these organisms is accomplished, in part, by the production of diffusible small molecules that inhibit the growth of many disease-causing fungi (19Haas D. Défago G. Biological control of soil-borne pathogens by fluorescent pseudomonads.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3 (15759041): 307-31910.1038/nrmicro1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). More recently, the T6SS has been demonstrated to play a role in suppressing the growth of bacterial pathogens. For example, the T6SS of P. fluorescens MFE01 can protect potato tubers from blackleg disease caused by Pectobacterium atrosepticum (20Decoin V. Barbey C. Bergeau D. Latour X. Feuilloley M.G. Orange N. Merieau A.

Similarly, the K1-T6SS from Pseudomonas putida KT2440 allows it to outcompete Xanthomonas campestris during co-infection of plant leaves (21Bernal P. Allsopp L.P. Filloux A. Llamas M.A. The Pseudomonas putida T6SS is a plant warden against phytopathogens.ISME J. 2017; 11 (28045455): 972-98710.1038/ismej.2016.169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of individual effector proteins in interbacterial competition was not assessed in either study. Despite the increasing number of characterized T6SS effectors in both Hcp- and VgrG-linked groups, their contribution to interbacterial killing by plant-protective Pseudomonas spp. has yet to be examined. Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 (formerly known as P. fluorescens Pf-5) is a well-characterized plant commensal bacterium that is of significant agricultural interest due to its biocontrol properties (22Paulsen I.T. Press C.M. Ravel J. Kobayashi D.Y. Myers G.S. Mavrodi D.V. DeBoy R.T. Seshadri R. Ren Q. Madupu R. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Brinkac L.M. Daugherty S.C.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23 (15980861): 873-87810.1038/nbt1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that this bacterium possesses a potent antibacterial T6SS (23Whitney J.C. Chou S. Russell A.B. Biboy J. Gardiner T.E. Ferrin M.A. Brittnacher M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

Furthermore, three Hcp-linked effectors have been identified by informatic and proteomic approaches (12Whitney J.C. Beck C.M. Goo Y.A. Russell A.B. Harding B.N. De Leon J.A. Cunningham D.A. Tran B.Q. Low D.A. Goodlett D.R. Hayes C.S. Mougous J.D. Genetically distinct pathways guide effector export through the type VI secretion system.Mol.

The contribution of two of these effectors, Tae3 and Tse4, in interbacterial competition has not been examined, although the third, Tge2, has been shown to confer a T6SS-dependent fitness advantage to P. protegens when co-cultured with competitor bacteria on low-salt media (23Whitney J.C. Chou S. Russell A.B. Biboy J. Gardiner T.E. Ferrin M.A. Brittnacher M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

Tge2 is thought to hydrolyze the glycan strands of cell wall peptidoglycan, potentially explaining its efficacy when cells are grown under hypoosmotic conditions; however, the contribution of Tge2 relative to the overall fitness advantage conferred by the T6SS of this organism is minimal. These findings suggest that either Tae2 and/or Tse4 are responsible for much of the T6SS-dependent growth inhibition or that there exist additional uncharacterized effectors in this organism. In this work, we sought to identify T6SS effectors responsible for interbacterial killing by P. protegens Pf-5. This led us to characterize two PAAR domain-containing effectors, which we subsequently show play a substantial role in interbacterial competition by this organism. Structural determination of one of these effectors revealed its mode of action as an NAD(P)+-hydrolyzing (NADase) enzyme, a biochemical activity not frequently associated with T6SS effectors. To further explore the potential diversity of NADase effectors, we next used iterative homology search algorithms and identified two phylogenetically distinct families of T6SS NADases. One of these families also contains a significant number of proteins associated with the bacterial type VII secretion system (T7SS), a pathway recently implicated in interbacterial antagonism between Gram-positive bacteria (25Whitney J.C. Peterson S.B. Kim J. Pazos M. Verster A.J. Radey M.C. Kulasekara H.D. Ching M.Q. Bullen N.P. Bryant D. Goo Y.A. Surette M.G. Borenstein E. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D.

Taken together, our findings reveal a broad distribution of interbacterial NADase enzymes and provide insight into how a plant commensal bacterium inhibits the growth of its bacterial competitors. The recent finding that PAAR domains function as interaction partners of VgrG proteins has enabled the facile identification of PAAR domain-containing T6SS effectors in diverse bacteria (17Shneider M.M. Buth S.A. Ho B.T. Basler M. Mekalanos J.J. Leiman P.G. PAAR-repeat proteins sharpen and diversify the type VI secretion system spike.Nature. 2013; 500 (23925114): 350-35310.1038/nature12453Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). We searched the genome of P. protegens Pf-5 for PAAR-encoding genes and identified two hypothetical T6SS effectors, PFL_6096 and PFL_6209 (Fig. 1A). The former of these genes, which we named rhsA, belongs to the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) family of T6SS effectors. Proteins encoded by rhs genes typically contain an N-terminal PAAR domain, a large internal segment composed of multiple tyrosine-aspartate (YD) repeats, and a polymorphic C-terminal toxin domain (27Ma J. Sun M. Dong W. Pan Z. Lu C. Yao H. PAAR-Rhs proteins harbor various C-terminal toxins to diversify the antibacterial pathways of type VI secretion systems.Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 19 (27871130): 345-36010.1111/1462-2920.13621Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The second effector, PFL_6209, also contains a predicted PAAR domain at its N terminus; however, it lacks identifiable YD repeats, and its C-terminal domain does not bear homology to characterized proteins. To assess the contribution of RhsA and PFL_6209 to interbacterial fitness under cell–contact-promoting conditions, various P. protegens donor strains were co-cultured with P. putida, a bacterium that also inhabits soil environments. P. putida was chosen as the competitor because we previously determined that the T6SS of P. protegens confers a significant fitness advantage over this organism (23Whitney J.C. Chou S. Russell A.B. Biboy J. Gardiner T.E. Ferrin M.A. Brittnacher M. Vollmer W. Mougous J.D. Identification, structure, and function of a novel type VI secretion peptidoglycan glycoside hydrolase effector-immunity pair.J. Biol.

We first compared the competitive fitness of wildtype P. protegens to that of a P. protegens strain lacking the three previously identified Hcp-associated effectors Tae3, Tge2, and Tse4. Under our experimental conditions, a P. protegens strain lacking these three effectors outcompeted P. putida to the same extent as the wildtype strain (Fig. 1B). We next assessed the competitive index of P. protegens strains bearing inactivating mutations in either rhsA or PFL_6209. Although the fitness of a P. protegens strain lacking PFL_6209 was indistinguishable from wildtype, a ΔrhsA mutant exhibited a moderate reduction in its ability to compete with P. putida. Additionally, a ΔPFL_6209 ΔrhsA double mutant displayed a reduction in competitive index that far exceeded that of the ΔrhsA donor strain. Importantly, this reduction in competitive fitness was not additive with a strain lacking T6SS apparatus function, indicating an epistatic relationship between these genes. In total, these data indicate that rhsA and PFL_6210 play a significant role in interspecies competition between P. protegens and P. putida. Multidomain T6SS effectors typically harbor domains with toxin activity at their C terminus (28Whitney J.C. Quentin D. Sawai S. LeRoux M. Harding B.N. Ledvina H.E. Tran B.Q. Robinson H. Goo Y.A. Goodlett D.R. Raunser S. Mougous J.D. An interbacterial NAD(P)(+) glycohydrolase toxin requires elongation factor Tu for delivery to target cells.Cell. 2015; 163 (26456113): 607-61910.1016/j.cell.2015.09.027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In line with this precedent, we found that expression of the C-terminal domain of RhsA (RhsAtox) significantly inhibited the growth of both E. coli and P. putida (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). This growth inhibition was abrogated upon co-expression with PFL_6097, indicating that the protein product of this gene (henceforth referred to as rhsI) confers immunity to RhsAtox-mediated toxicity. The C-terminal toxin domains of several previously characterized Rhs proteins possess DNase activity (29Koskiniemi S. Lamoureux J.G. Nikolakakis K.C. t'Kint de Roodenbeke C. Kaplan M.D. Low D.A. Hayes C.S. Rhs proteins from diverse bacteria mediate intercellular competition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23572593): 7032-703710.1073/pnas.1300627110Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C terminus of RhsA belongs to a superfamily of restriction endonucleases possessing a conserved aspartic acid dyad (NCBI conserved domain accession number cl00516) (Fig. S2A). Site-specific mutation of one of these residues, Asp-1399, abrogated growth inhibition suggesting that this effector also exerts toxicity by hydrolyzing DNA (Fig. S2B). In contrast to the toxin domain of RhsA, the C terminus of PFL_6209 does not share homology with proteins of known function. Nonetheless, we found that heterologous expression of the C-terminal domain of PFL_6209 (PFL_6209tox) inhibits both E. coli and P. putida growth, demonstrating that like RhsA, the C terminus of PFL_6209 also encodes an antibacterial toxin (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1). Additionally, co-expression of the downstream gene, PFL_6210, confers immunity to the activity of this toxin. Taken together, our data suggest that P. protegens employs a nucleic acid-degrading effector and an effector of unknown activity to gain a fitness advantage over competitor bacteria. We next sought to determine the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity exhibited by PFL_6209. To this end, we first determined the 1.7-Å co-crystal structure of PFL_6209tox in complex with PFL_6210 using selenium-incorporated protein and the selenium single wavelength anomalous dispersion technique (30Rice L.M.

The PFL_6209tox–PFL_6210 complex crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 with two copies each of PFL_6209tox and PFL_6210 in the asymmetric unit. The electron density allowed for both copies of the toxin-immunity complex to be built in their entirety with the exception of the N-terminal hexahistidine tag and several vector-encoded amino acids that were fused to PFL_6209tox to facilitate purification of the complex. The final model was refined to an Rwork of 18.1% and Rfree of 21.6% (Table 1).Table 1X-ray data collection and refinement statisticsTne2tox –Tni2 (selenomethionine)Data collectionBeamline21-ID-FWavelength (Å)0.979Space groupC2Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)176.7, 40.6, 95.9α, β, γ (°)90.0, 97.2, 90.0Resolution (Å)68.94–1.71 (1.77–1.71)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell.Total no. of reflections145,128Total no. of unique reflections72,673Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σ Σ |I(k) − 〈I〉|/Σ I(k), where I(k) and 〈I〉 represent the diffraction intensity values of the individual measurements and the corresponding mean values.

Open table in a new tab PFL_6209tox adopts a mixed α/β fold consisting of two α-helices and six β-strands (Fig. 2A). The toxin exhibits an overall globular form with the most notable surface feature being a deep cavity that extends ∼12 Å into the core of the protein. This cavity, which we hypothesize includes the active site of PFL_6209tox, is partially occluded by the C terminus of PFL_6210 (Fig. 2B). A search of the PDB using the DALI server identified the toxin domain of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T6SS effector Tse6 (Tse6tox) as the top structural homolog of PFL_6209tox with a Z-score of 10.0. Despite having only 17% sequence identity between them, the toxin domains of PFL_6210 and Tse6 superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 2.2 Å over 97 equivalent Cα positions (Fig. 3A).Figure 3PFL_6209tox resembles the NADase domain of the T6SS effector Tse6.

https://openalex.org/W2774281604,"Copper is required for the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal electron-accepting complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The likely source of copper used for COX biogenesis is a labile pool found in the mitochondrial matrix. In mammals, the proteins that transport copper across the inner mitochondrial membrane remain unknown. We previously reported that the mitochondrial carrier family protein Pic2 in budding yeast is a copper importer. The closest Pic2 ortholog in mammalian cells is the mitochondrial phosphate carrier SLC25A3. Here, to investigate whether SLC25A3 also transports copper, we manipulated its expression in several murine and human cell lines. SLC25A3 knockdown or deletion consistently resulted in an isolated COX deficiency in these cells, and copper addition to the culture medium suppressed these biochemical defects. Consistent with a conserved role for SLC25A3 in copper transport, its heterologous expression in yeast complemented copper-specific defects observed upon deletion of PIC2. Additionally, assays in Lactococcus lactis and in reconstituted liposomes directly demonstrated that SLC25A3 functions as a copper transporter. Taken together, these data indicate that SLC25A3 can transport copper both in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2771573931,"Liver cancer is an emerging global health issue, with rising incidence in both the United States and the economically developing world. Although Guatemala experiences the highest rates of this disease in the Western hemisphere and a unique 1:1 distribution in men and women, few studies have focused on this population. Thus, we determined the prevalence and correlates of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) exposure and hepatitis virus infection in Guatemalan adults. Healthy men and women aged ≥40 years (n = 461), residing in five departments of Guatemala, were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from May—October of 2016. Serum AFB1-albumin adducts were quantified using isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess relationships between AFB1-albumin adduct levels and demographic factors. Biomarkers of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection were assessed by immunoassay and analyzed by Fisher’s exact test. AFB1-albumin adducts were detected in 100% of participants, with a median of 8.4 pg/mg albumin (range, 0.2–814.8). Exposure was significantly higher (p<0.05) in male, rural, low-income, and less-educated participants than in female, urban, and higher socioeconomic status participants. Hepatitis B and C seropositivity was low (0.9% and 0.5%, respectively). Substantial AFB1 exposure exists in Guatemalan adults, concurrent with low prevalence of hepatitis virus seropositivity. Quantitatively, AFB1 exposures are similar to those previously found to increase risk for liver cancer in Asia and Africa. Mitigation of AFB1 exposure may reduce liver cancer incidence and mortality in Guatemala, warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2774939546,"Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels constitute the major Ca2+ entry pathway into the cell. They are fully reconstituted via intermembrane coupling of the Ca2+-selective Orai channel and the Ca2+-sensing protein STIM1. In addition to the Orai C terminus, the main coupling site for STIM1, the Orai N terminus is indispensable for Orai channel gating. Although the extended transmembrane Orai N-terminal region (Orai1 amino acids 73-91; Orai3 amino acids 48-65) is fully conserved in the Orai1 and Orai3 isoforms, Orai3 tolerates larger N-terminal truncations than Orai1 in retaining store-operated activation. In an attempt to uncover the reason for these isoform-specific structural requirements, we analyzed a series of Orai mutants and chimeras. We discovered that it was not the N termini, but the loop2 regions connecting TM2 and TM3 of Orai1 and Orai3 that featured distinct properties, which explained the different, isoform-specific behavior of Orai N-truncation mutants. Atomic force microscopy studies and MD simulations suggested that the remaining N-terminal portion in the non-functional Orai1 N-truncation mutants formed new, inhibitory interactions with the Orai1-loop2 regions, but not with Orai3-loop2. Such a loop2 swap restored activation of the N-truncation Orai1 mutants. To mimic interactions between the N terminus and loop2 in full-length Orai1 channels, we induced close proximity of the N terminus and loop2 via cysteine cross-linking, which actually caused significant inhibition of STIM1-mediated Orai currents. In aggregate, maintenance of Orai activation required not only the conserved N-terminal region but also permissive communication of the Orai N terminus and loop2 in an isoform-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2771948964,"Accumulation of Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells in the tumor microenvironment is associated with tumor immune evasion and poor patient outcome in the case of many solid tumors. Current therapeutic strategies for blocking Treg functions are not Treg-specific, and display only modest and transient efficacy. Recent studies revealed that ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is essential for Treg functions by stabilizing expression of Tip60 and Foxp3, which together are central to the development and maintenance of the Treg cell lineage. Pharmacological inhibition of USP7 is therefore a promising strategy for suppressing Treg functions and promoting anti-tumor immunity. Previously, we reported the P5091 series of small molecule USP7 inhibitors and demonstrated their direct anti-tumor activity in vivo using xenograft models. However, the precise mechanism of action of these compounds was not well defined. In this study, we report the development and characterization of P217564, a second-generation USP7 inhibitor with improved potency and selectivity. P217564 selectively targets the catalytic cleft of USP7 and modifies its active site cysteine (C223) by forming a covalent adduct. Irreversible inhibition of USP7 results in durable downstream biological responses in cells, including down-regulation of Tip60 and consequent impairment of Treg suppressive function. In addition, we demonstrate that both USP7 and various USP7 substrates are subjected to Lys48-mediated ubiquitin modification, consistent with increased proteasomal degradation of these proteins because of USP7 inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2772146535,"Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential second messenger required for diverse signaling processes in immune cells. Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels represent one main Ca2+ entry pathway into the cell. They are fully reconstituted via two proteins, the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), a Ca2+ sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Ca2+ ion channel Orai in the plasma membrane. After Ca2+ store depletion, STIM1 and Orai couple to each other, allowing Ca2+ influx. CRAC-/STIM1-mediated Orai channel currents display characteristic hallmarks such as high Ca2+ selectivity, an increase in current density when switching from a Ca2+-containing solution to a divalent-free Na+ one, and fast Ca2+-dependent inactivation. Here, we discovered several constitutively active Orai1 and Orai3 mutants, containing substitutions in the TM3 and/or TM4 regions, all of which displayed a loss of the typical CRAC channel hallmarks. Restoring authentic CRAC channel activity required both the presence of STIM1 and the conserved Orai N-terminal portion. Similarly, these structural requisites were found in store-operated Orai channels. Key molecular determinants within the Orai N terminus that together with STIM1 maintained the typical CRAC channel hallmarks were distinct from those that controlled store-dependent Orai activation. In conclusion, the conserved portion of the Orai N terminus is essential for STIM1, as it fine-tunes the open Orai channel gating, thereby establishing authentic CRAC channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2773107428,"A current public health issue is preventing post-surgical complications by designing antibacterial implants. To achieve this goal, in this study we evaluated the antibacterial activity of an animal-free chitosan grafted onto a titanium alloy.Animal-free chitosan binding on the substrate was performed by covalent link via a two-step process using TriEthoxySilylPropyl Succinic Anhydride (TESPSA) as the coupling agent. All grafting steps were studied and validated by means of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Time-of-Flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analyses and Dynamic-mode Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (DSIMS). The antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus strains of the developed coating was assessed using the number of colony forming units (CFU).XPS showed a significant increase in the C and N atomic percentages assigned to the presence of chitosan. A thick layer of polymer deposit was detected by ToF-SIMS and the results obtained by DSIMS measurements are in agreement with ToF-SIMS and XPS analyses and confirms that the coating synthesis was a success. The developed coating was active against both gram negative and gram positive tested bacteria.The success of the chitosan immobilization was proven using the surface characterization techniques applied in this study. The coating was found to be effective against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus strains."

https://openalex.org/W2774704850,"The proangiogenic cytokine Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is released by inflammatory cells in breast and ovarian cancer tissue microenvironments and also acts as an autocrine factor for human breast and kidney tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs). We have previously shown that IL-3-treated endothelial cells (ECs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which serve as a paracrine mechanism for neighboring ECs, by transferring active molecules. The impact of an anti-IL-3R-alpha blocking antibody on the proangiogenic effect of EVs released from TECs (anti-IL-3R-EVs) has therefore been investigated in this study. We have found that anti-IL-3R-EV treatment prevented neovessel formation and, more importantly, also induced the regression of in vivo TEC-derived neovessels. Two miRs that target the canonical wingless (Wnt)/β-catenin pathway, at different levels, were found to be differentially regulated when comparing the miR-cargo of naive TEC-derived EVs (EVs) and anti-IL-3R-EVs. miR-214-3p, which directly targets β-catenin, was found to be upregulated, whereas miR-24-3p, which targets adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), was found to be downregulated. In fact, upon their transfer into the cell, low β-catenin content and high levels of the two members of the ""β-catenin destruction complex"" were detected. Moreover, c-myc downregulation was found in TECs treated with anti-IL-3R-EVs, pre-miR-214-3p-EVs and antago-miR-24-3p-EVs, which is consistent with network analyses of miR-214-3p and miR-24-3p gene targeting. Finally, in vivo studies have demonstrated the impaired growth of vessels in pre-miR-214-3p-EV- and antago-miR-24-3p-EV-treated animals. These effects became much more evident when combo treatment was applied. The results of the present study identify the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a relevant mechanism of TEC-derived EV proangiogenic action. Furthermore, we herein provide evidence that IL-3R blockade may yield some significant advantages, than miR targeting, in inhibiting the proangiogenic effects of naive TEC-derived EVs by changing TEC-EV-miR cargo."
https://openalex.org/W2772994295,"The objective of the study was to investigate the results of Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) conducted in three referral hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria over a two-year period and to report the outcomes and the lessons learned. MPDRS panels were constituted in the three hospitals, and beginning from January 2015, we conducted monthly MPDSR in the three hospitals using a nationally approved protocol. Data on births and deaths and causes of deaths as identified by the MPDSR panels were collated in the hospitals. The results show that over a 21-month period (January 1, 2015 -September 30, 2016), maternal mortality ratio (MMR) remained high in the hospitals. Although there was a trend towards an increase in MMR in Lagos Island Maternity Hospital and Gbagada General Hospital, and a trend towards a decline in Ajeromi Hospital, none of these trends were statistically significant. Eclampsia, primary post-partum haemorrhage, obstructed labour and puerperal sepsis were the leading obstetric causes of death. By contrast, delay in arrival in hospital, the lack of antenatal care and patients' refusal to receive recommended treatment were the patients' associated causes of death, while delay in treatment, poor use of treatment protocols, lack of equipment and lack of skills by providers to use available equipment were the identified facility-related causes of death. Failure to address the patients and facility-related causes of maternal mortality possibly accounted for the persistently high maternal mortality ratio in the hospitals. We conclude that interventions aimed at redressing all causes of maternal deaths identified in the reviews will likely reduce the maternal mortality ratios in the hospitals."

The mannose receptor (MR, CD206), expressed primarily by macrophages, mediates endocytosis, antigen presentation and T-cell activation. A soluble form, sMR, has recently been identified in humans. We aimed to study plasma sMR levels and its correlation with disease severity and survival in ALD patients.We included 50 patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), 68 alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) patients (Child-Pugh A (23), B (24), C (21)), and 21 healthy controls (HC). Liver status was described by the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS), Child-Pugh (CP) and MELD-scores, and in AC patients the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was measured by liver vein catheterisation. We used Kaplan-Meier statistics for short-term survival (84-days) in AH patients and long-term (4 years) in AC patients. We measured plasma sMR by ELISA.Median sMR concentrations were significantly elevated in AH 1.32(IQR:0.69) and AC 0.46(0.5) compared to HC 0.2(0.06) mg/L; p<0.001 and increased in a stepwise manner with the CP-score (p<0.001). In AC sMR predicted portal hypertension (HVPG ≥10 mmHg) with an area under the Receiver Operator Characteristics curve of 0.86 and a high sMR cut-off (>0.43 mg/l) was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.005).The soluble mannose receptor is elevated in alcoholic liver disease, especially in patients with AH. Its blood level predicts portal hypertension and long-term mortality in AC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2775377404,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) belong to the family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and mediate fast excitatory transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Among the different existing receptor subtypes, the homomeric α7 nAChR has attracted considerable attention because of its possible implication in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Allosteric modulators of ligand-gated ion channels are of particular interest as therapeutic agents, as they modulate receptor activity without affecting normal fluctuations of synaptic neurotransmitter release. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of α7-acetylcholine–binding protein (AChBP), a humanized chimera of a snail AChBP, which has 71% sequence similarity with the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human α7 nAChR, to investigate the structural determinants of allosteric modulation. We extended previous observations that an allosteric site located in the vestibule of the receptor offers an attractive target for receptor modulation. We introduced seven additional humanizing mutations in the vestibule-located binding site of AChBP to improve its suitability as a model for studying allosteric binding. Using a fragment-based screening approach, we uncovered an allosteric binding site located near the β8–β9 loop, which critically contributes to coupling ligand binding to channel opening in human α7 nAChR. This work expands our understanding of the topology of allosteric binding sites in AChBP and, by extrapolation, in the human α7 nAChR as determined by electrophysiology measurements.

From a therapeutic perspective, two specific nAChR subtypes have been explored extensively, namely the homomeric α7 nAChR and the heteromeric α4β2 nAChR. The α4β2 nAChR is the target for the addictive effects of nicotine in tobacco smokers and a partial agonist, varenicline (Champix®), has reached the market for the treatment of nicotine addiction (6Hays J.T.

Agonists for α7 nAChRs have a major disadvantage that prolonged receptor activation produces sustained receptor activation and desensitization, thereby decreasing the normal fluctuations in acetylcholine signaling at the synapse (9Uteshev V.V. The therapeutic promise of positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors.Eur. J.

In contrast, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of α7 nAChRs enhance receptor function in the presence of acetylcholine while preserving normal fluctuations of receptor activation (10Williams D.K.

Structural insight into the molecular architecture of integral nAChRs has been revealed through the pioneering work of Unwin et al. (12Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Structure and gating mechanism of the acetylcholine receptor pore.Nature. 2003; 423 (12827192): 949-95510.1038/nature01748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) on the Torpedo nAChR and recently, with the X-ray structure determination of the human α4β2 nAChR bound to nicotine (13Morales-Perez C.L.

In contrast, a three-dimensional structure for the integral α7 nAChR is not yet available, but a wealth of structural data exist for the acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) (14Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

At present, more than 100 crystal structures have been determined of AChBPs in complex with a wide variety of agonists, partial agonists and antagonists, as available in the Protein Data Bank. In addition, a chimera of AChBP and the extracellular ligand-binding domain human α7 nAChR, named α7-AChBP, has been engineered that has 64% sequence identity and 71% sequence similarity with the α7 nAChR ligand-binding domain (16Li S.-X. Huang S. Bren N. Noridomi K. Dellisanti C.D. Sine S.M. Chen L. Ligand-binding domain of an α7-nicotinic receptor chimera and its complex with agonist.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21909087): 1253-125910.1038/nn.2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Previously, we have employed α7-AChBP to unveil novel allosteric binding sites using a fragment-based screening approach in which the neurotransmitter-binding site was occupied with a known partial agonist and unoccupied allosteric sites were identified through novel binders from a fragment library (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C.

U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among the identified allosteric sites the so-called vestibule-binding site appears to be particularly attractive as it overlaps with a benzodiazepine-binding site in the prokaryote ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, which is positively modulated by the benzodiazepine flurazepam (18Spurny R. Ramerstorfer J. Price K. Brams M. Ernst M. Nury H. Verheij M. Legrand P. Bertrand D. Bertrand S. Dougherty D.A. de Esch I.J.P. Corringer P.-J. Sieghart W. Lummis S.C. Ulens C. Pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC is activated by GABA and modulated by benzodiazepines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: E3028-E303410.1073/pnas.1208208109Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we extended these observations and engineered an improved α7-AChBP harboring additional humanizing mutations in the vestibule-binding site. Using a fragment-based screening approach we identified additional allosteric binders and unexpectedly, we unveiled a novel allosteric binding site, which is located near the β8–β9 loop. This site partially overlaps with a known modulatory site for Ca2+, which potentiates the human α7 nAChR (19Galzi J.L. Bertrand S. Corringer P.J. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. Identification of calcium binding sites that regulate potentiation of a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.EMBO J. 1996; 15 (8918460): 5824-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to enhance our understanding of the structural determinants of allosteric modulation of nAChRs and to develop improved tools for structure-based design of new therapeutics targeting the human α7 nAChR. To this end, we employed α7-AChBP, which is a previously designed chimera between the human α7 nAChR and the Lymnaea stagnalis AChBP and has 64% sequence identity with the α7 nAChR ligand-binding domain (16Li S.-X. Huang S. Bren N. Noridomi K. Dellisanti C.D. Sine S.M. Chen L. Ligand-binding domain of an α7-nicotinic receptor chimera and its complex with agonist.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 (21909087): 1253-125910.1038/nn.2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our preferred target site for allosteric modulation of the receptor is the previously identified vestibule-binding site (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C. Molecular blueprint of allosteric binding sites in a homologue of the agonist-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which corresponds to a benzodiazepine-binding site of the prokaryote ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, which is positively modulated by the benzodiazepine flurazepam (18Spurny R. Ramerstorfer J. Price K. Brams M. Ernst M. Nury H. Verheij M. Legrand P. Bertrand D. Bertrand S. Dougherty D.A. de Esch I.J.P. Corringer P.-J. Sieghart W. Lummis S.C. Ulens C.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: E3028-E303410.1073/pnas.1208208109Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To improve the resemblance of α7-AChBP to the human α7 nAChR we introduced additional humanizing mutations in the local environment of the vestibule-binding site based on the amino acid interactions formed with a previously identified vestibule binder, named fragment molecule 4 (PDB code 5afm) (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C. Molecular blueprint of allosteric binding sites in a homologue of the agonist-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In total, we expressed 12 single point mutants substituting each residue by its corresponding residue in the human α7 nAChR, namely F52I, I80D, V85K, L88I, A89L, A90L, S95E, K96R, P97F, I119G, Q121F, and F123S. Among these 12 mutants, 7 were tolerated, namely F52I, V85K, L88I, A89L, A90L, S95E, and K96R. We defined a “tolerated” mutation as a mutation that results in detectable protein secreted in the expression medium, similar to wildtype α7-AChBP. “Not-tolerated” mutations failed to produce secreted protein, because of folding, trafficking, or other issues. The remaining 5 mutants were not-tolerated. Next, the 7 tolerated mutations in the vestibule-binding site were combined into a single construct, which we termed α7-AChBPVS. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of α7-AChBPVS in complex with the partial agonist α-lobeline (Table 2). Similar to our previous approach (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C. Molecular blueprint of allosteric binding sites in a homologue of the agonist-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) we chose to determine structures bound to α-lobeline because crystals grown in the presence of α-lobeline gave more robust diffraction than apo crystals, thus facilitating subsequent studies with allosteric binders. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the overall architecture of lobeline-bound α7-AChBPVS, which is composed of 5 subunits radially arranged around a central pore. Human α7 nAChR residues are colored in blue and Lymnaea AChBP residues are colored in orange. The neurotransmitter-binding site is localized at the interface between each of two subunits and is occupied by α-lobeline in this structure (shown in sphere representation in Fig. 1). Fig. 1, C and D, shows a single α7-AChBPVS subunit and the location of the vestibule-binding site relative to the neurotransmitter-binding site. The vestibule-binding site is an intrasubunit site accessible from the receptor vestibule and located opposite to the neurotransmitter-binding site. Both sites are separated by a wall including the β4- and β7-strands. As can be seen from the surface representation in Fig. 1D the amino acid residues composing the vestibule-binding site now have an improved identity with human α7 nAChR residues (colored in green). In α7-AChBPVS the local environment of the vestibule-binding site was partially humanized through 7 mutations, F52I, V85K, L88I, A89L, A90L, S95E, and K96R (shown in green sticks in Fig. 1E).Table 2Chemical structures of allosteric fragment molecules Open table in a new tab To confirm the structural integrity of the vestibule-binding site in α7-AChBPVS we also determined the X-ray crystal structure of α7-AChBPVS in complex with α-lobeline and the allosteric binder fragment 4 (Table 1, Table 2). Similar to our previous approach (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C. Molecular blueprint of allosteric binding sites in a homologue of the agonist-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) we took advantage of the 2 bromine atoms in fragment 4 to pinpoint their location in an anomalous density map. Fig. 2, A–D, shows a schematic representation of a single α7-AChBPVS subunit and ligands shown in ball and stick representation. Unexpectedly, we observe that fragment 4 not only occupies the vestibule-binding site, but also another allosteric site at the N-terminal top side of the receptor, which we termed the top binding site (Fig. 2, A and B) as it was also bound by a different fragment molecule 1 in our previous study (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C. Molecular blueprint of allosteric binding sites in a homologue of the agonist-binding domain of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: E2543-E255210.1073/pnas.1418289112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inspection of the anomalous density map reveals peaks (shown as magenta mesh in Fig. 2, B and D) almost twice as intense at the top binding site compared with the vestibule-binding site suggesting that fragment 4 even binds the top site with higher occupancy than the vestibule site. The fact that we observe fragment 4 not only in the vestibule site, but also in the top site could be explained by possible allosteric effects of the humanizing mutations on the top site, or alternatively, by the slightly differing crystallization conditions for the α7-AChBPVS complex compared with α7-AChBP in our previous study (17Spurny R. Debaveye S. Farinha A. Veys K. Vos A.M. Gossas T. Atack J. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Danielson U.H. Tresadern G. Ulens C.

In the top site, the carboxamide moiety of fragment 4 forms hydrogen bonds (indicated as black dashed lines in Fig. 2B) with the backbone atoms of Glu-9, Leu-10, and Tyr-62, whereas the side chain of Leu-10 flips outward to expose the binding site. The hydroxypropyl moiety of fragment 4 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr-70, which is located in a loop connecting the β2- and β3-strands. Additionally, fragment 4 forms van der Waals interactions with Leu-6, Tyr-7, Leu-63, Gln-64, Val-76, Val-78, and Val-107.Table 1Crystallographic and refinement statisticsCrystallographic statisticsα7-AChBPvs +α-lobelineα7-AChBPvs +α-lobeline and fragment 4α7-AChBPvs +fragment CU2017PDB accession code5ouh5oug5ouiBeamlineI04-1 (DLS)PROXIMA-I (SOLEIL)I04–1 (DLS)Date of collection15-Mar-201710-Feb-201716-Mar-2017Wavelength (Å)0.928180.9198300.92818Space groupP212121P21P212121a, b, c (Å)87.79, 113.32, 146.9668.673, 119.805, 84.54387.75, 113.14, 145.89α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 90.0090.000, 107.288, 90.00090.00, 90.00, 90.00Resolution limits (Å)87.79 - 2.50 (2.58 - 2.50)66.95 - 2.57 (2.67 - 2.57)72.94 - 3.10 (3.29 - 3.10)Rmerge14.1 (289)12.8 (213)50.4 (445)Rmeas15.2 (313)15.3 (253)54.4 (480)Rpim5.7 (119)8.3 (135)20.3 (179)〈I/σ〉12.7 (1.0)11.4 (1.3)6.4 (1.0)CC1/2 (%)99.9 (54.3)99.6 (30.5)98.3 (43.0)Multiplicity13.5 (13.3)6.7 (6.5)13.4 (13.6)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)99.8 (98.6)100.0 (100.0)Total number of reflections695,420 (59,142)277,801 (31,273)362,469 (58,442)Number of unique reflections51,511 (4,447)41,656 (4,603)27,070 (4,285)Anomalous completeness98.6 (97.4)99.9 (100.0)Anomalous multiplicity3.4 (3.4)7.1 (7.1)Refinement and model statisticsRwork (%)20.7 (36.9)23.1 (36.6)24.1 (38.8)Rfree (%)25.0 (36.3)26.0 (33.2)28.0 (50.2)Bond length root mean square deviation (Å)0.0090.0080.010Bond angle root mean square deviation (°)1.4001.3491.486Ramachandran plot favored/outliers (%)98.13/098.72/098.33/0Rotamer favored/outliers (%)96.36/095.52/0.293.66/1.04MolProbity score (percentile)2.39 (100th percentile)1.00 (100th percentile)1.61 (100th percentile) Open table in a new tab In the vestibule-binding site (Fig. 2D) fragment 4 forms a hydrogen bond (indicated as black dashed line) via the pyrrole nitrogen and Gln-121. Van der Waals interactions are formed with Leu-54, Leu-89, Leu-90, Pro-97, Leu-100, Thr-101, Pro-102, Ile-119, and Phe-142. In the neurotransmitter-binding site (Fig. 2C) the difference density map reveals features for the central piperidine moiety of α-lobeline, but less clearly for the extreme phenyl moieties. This can be explained by the fact that α-lobeline is flexible and adopts different partially overlapping ligand binding poses around the piperidine moiety as observed in previous structures of Aplysia and Capitella AChBPs and α7-AChBP (20Hibbs R.E.

To further validate α7-AChBPVS as an improved model for structural and functional studies we verified the pharmacological properties of α7-AChBPVS via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. We determined the binding characteristics of a range of representative agonists (acetylcholine, nicotine), partial agonists (varenicline, α-lobeline), antagonists (d-tubocurarine, strychnine), and allosteric modulators (fragment 4 and additional binders described below) and compared them for α7-AChBPVS and α7-AChBP (17Spurny R.

Overall, binding affinities of the tested ligands were comparable for α7-AChBPVS and α7-AChBP with the exception of acetylcholine, varenicline, and nicotine, which displayed 10-fold higher KD values for α7-AChBPVS compared with α7-AChBP (Table 3). Although the neurotransmitter-binding site was preserved from mutations, these orthosteric binders showed a lower affinity, which was not observed with the other compounds that bind the same pocket. The mutations in the vestibule-binding site seemed not to alter the binding affinity for the previously described allosteric binder, fragment 4. Both proteins showed a weak interaction with fragment 4 with a KD of 1420 μm for α7-AChBP and 1703 μm for α7-AChBPVS. However, the latter represents an “apparent” KD value because it is higher than half the highest analyte concentration used (i.e. 3 mm). Together, these results validate α7-AChBPVS as an improved model for structural and functional studies of ligand recognition at the vestibule-binding site. Because the additional humanizing mutations appear to affect the orthosteric binding site it is important to interpret results related to this site with caution.Table 3Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) as determined for different ligands via surface plasmon resonance spectroscopyKD α7-AChBPKD α7-AChBPVSμmAcetylcholine23.92 ± 4.83202.38 ± 81.32***Nicotine1.60 ± 0.1911.40 ± 0.80***Varenicline1.24 ± 0.179.90 ± 1.28***α-Lobeline0.75 ± 0.132.14 ± 1.06*d-Tubocurarine1.29 ± 0.191.41 ± 1.02NSaNS, not significant.Strychnine2.14 ± 0.512.64 ± 0.54NSFragment 41420.00 ± 98.491703.44 ± 627.74NSCU201740.04 ± 19.4793.57 ± 35.08**a NS, not significant. Open table in a new tab Our next goal was to obtain additional fragment molecules binding the vestibule site as a template to design a high affinity lead compound targeting this site. A conventional approach is to pre-screen fragment hits from a fragment library using a biophysical method amenable to high-throughput screening, such as SPR, and to select those hits for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. However, example cases have shown that hit selection highly depends on the biophysical screening method used and consequently, a large proportion of fragment molecules suitable for structure determination can be missed (23Schiebel J.

https://openalex.org/W2772568733,"A weak magnetic field regulates magnetically gated accretion of gas from a companion star onto the white dwarf in the binary system MV Lyrae, previously labelled as a ‘non-magnetic’ system. White dwarfs are often found in binary systems where they can accrete gas from a close companion star. In about 15 per cent of such systems the white dwarf's magnetic field is strong enough to channel the gas to its poles. The others have been labelled 'non-magnetic'. Simone Scaringi and collaborators find that a weak magnetic field regulates accretion onto the white dwarf in the binary system MV Lyrae, which has been counted among the non-magnetic, in what is called 'magnetically gated accretion'. The team suggest that the white dwarf's magnetic field strength is too low to be picked up by other current detection methods. White dwarfs are often found in binary systems with orbital periods ranging from tens of minutes to hours in which they can accrete gas from their companion stars. In about 15 per cent of these binaries, the magnetic field of the white dwarf is strong enough (at 106 gauss or more) to channel the accreted matter along field lines onto the magnetic poles1,2. The remaining systems are referred to as ‘non-magnetic’, because until now there has been no evidence that they have a magnetic field that is strong enough to affect the accretion dynamics. Here we report an analysis of archival optical observations of the ‘non-magnetic’ accreting white dwarf in the binary system MV Lyrae, whose light curve displays quasi-periodic bursts of about 30 minutes duration roughly every 2 hours. The timescale and amplitude of these bursts indicate the presence of an unstable, magnetically regulated accretion mode, which in turn implies the existence of magnetically gated accretion3,4,5, in which disk material builds up around the magnetospheric boundary (at the co-rotation radius) and then accretes onto the white dwarf, producing bursts powered by the release of gravitational potential energy. We infer a surface magnetic field strength for the white dwarf in MV Lyrae of between 2 × 104 gauss and 1 × 105 gauss, too low to be detectable by other current methods. Our discovery provides a new way of studying the strength and evolution of magnetic fields in accreting white dwarfs and extends the connections between accretion onto white dwarfs, young stellar objects and neutron stars, for which similar magnetically gated accretion cycles have been identified6,7,8,9."
https://openalex.org/W2772625237,"Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in all age groups worldwide. Despite the high genetic diversity of noroviruses, most AGE outbreaks are caused by a single norovirus genotype: GII.4. Since 1995, several different variants of norovirus GII.4 have been associated with pandemics, with each variant circulating for 3 to 8 years. The Sydney_2012 variant was first reported in Australia and then in other countries. A new variant, GII.P16-GII.4, was recently described in Japan and South Korea and then in the USA, France, Germany and England. In our study, 190 faecal specimens were collected from children admitted to a paediatric hospital and a public health facility during a surveillance study of sporadic cases of AGE conducted between January 2015 and July 2016. The norovirus was detected by RT-qPCR in 51 samples (26.8%), and in 37 of them (72.5%), the ORF1-2 junction was successfully sequenced. The new recombinant GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney was revealed for the first time in Brazil in 2016 and predominated among other strains (9 GII.Pe-GII.4, 3 GII.P17-GII.17, 1 GII.Pg-GII.1, 1 GII.P16-GII.3 and 1 GII.PNA-GII.4). The epidemiological significance of this new recombinant is still unknown, but continuous surveillance studies may evaluate its impact on the population, its potential to replace the first recombinant GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant, and the emergence of new recombinant forms of GII.P16."
https://openalex.org/W2775661063,"Bangia fuscopurpurea is a traditional mariculture crop having high nutritional value, eicosapntemacnioc acid (EPA) production, and protein content. As an intertidal species, it can tolerate drastic changes in abiotic factors such as temperature, hydration, and light radiation; however, genomic information on the evolutionary aspect and mechanism of EPA enrichment in B. fuscopurpurea and the role of EPA in cold tolerance in this species remain elusive. We conducted transcriptome profile analysis in B. fuscopurpurea to investigate the biological functions of genes associated with resistance to various environment factors. We identified 41,935 unigenes that were assembled and applied to public databases to define their functional annotation (NR, GO, KEGG, KOG, and SwissProt). We further identified genes that encoded key enzymes in EPA biosynthesis; five paralogous genes encoding delta5 desaturase were detected in B. fuscopurpurea. Fatty acid profiling and gene expression analysis of B. fuscopurpurea grown under cold stress were simultaneously performed. The EPA content was increased by 29.8% in the samples grown at 4°C, while the total amount of fatty acids remained unchanged. Moreover, all the EPA biosynthesis-related desaturase and elongase genes were upregulated under cold stress. Thus, we hypothesized that diverse EPA biosynthesis pathways and significant increase in gene copy numbers of fatty acid desaturases, together with the concomitant elevation in the transcriptional level of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism, lead to EPA accumulation and subsequently affect membrane fluidity, contributing to cold stress resistance in B. fuscopurpurea. Our findings not only provide a fundamental genetic background for further research in B. fuscopurpurea, but also have important implications for screening and genetic engineering of algae and plants for EPA production."
https://openalex.org/W2771158809,"We propose a novel four-ring hollow-core silicon photonic crystal fiber (PCF), and we systematically and theoretically investigate the properties of their vector modes. Our PCF can stably support 30 OAM states from the wavelength of 1.5 μm to 2.4 μm, with a large effective refractive index separation of above 1×10-4. The confinement loss is less than 1×10-9 dB/m at the wavelength of 1.55 μm, and the average confinement loss is less than 1×10-8 dB/m from the wavelength of 1.2 μm to 2.4 μm. Moreover, the curve of the dispersion tends to flatten as the wavelength increases. In addition, we comparably investigate PCFs with different hole spacing. This kind of fiber structure will be a potential candidate for high-capacity optical fiber communications and OAM sensing applications using fibers."

Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a recently discovered cytokine that exhibits potent immunosuppressive functions. However, the role of IL-35 in islet transplant rejection remains to be elucidated. In this study, we isolated islet cells of BALB/c mouse and purified CD4+ T cell subsets of a C57BL/6 mouse. The model for islet transplantation was established in vitro by co-culture of the islet cells and CD4+ T cells. IL-35 (20 ng/ml) was administered every other day. Following co-culture, the islet function and Treg/Th17 ratio were analyzed on days 1, 3, and 5. Furthermore, the Th17/Treg ratio was modulated (1:0-2), and the function of islet cells as well as proliferation of Th17 cells were analyzed. T cell sorting was performed using the magnetic bead sorting method; Treg and Th17 count using flow cytometry; cell proliferation detection using the carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) method, and islet function test using the sugar stimulation test. Results showed that Th17 counts increased in the co-culture system. However, after administration of IL-35, the number of Treg cells increased significantly compared to that in the control group (50.7% of total CD4+ T cells on day 5 in IL-35 group vs. 9.5% in control group) whereas the proliferation rate of Th17 cells was significantly inhibited (0.3% in IL-35 group vs. 7.2% in control group on day 5). Reducing the Th17/Treg ratio significantly improved the function of transplanted islets. Treg inhibited Th17 proliferation and IL-35 enhanced this inhibitory effect. IL-35 mitigates the function of murine transplanted islet cells via regulation of the Treg/Th17 ratio. This might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for in-vivo islet transplant rejection and T1D."

The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain.

Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell-surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline. However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat dorsal root ganglia neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton-sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing the nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel.

https://openalex.org/W2772442258,"EphrinA1, a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase ligand expressed in healthy cardiomyocytes, is lost in injured cells following myocardial infarction. Previously, we have reported that a single intramyocardial injection of chimeric ephrinA1-Fc at the time of ischemia reduced injury in the nonreperfused myocardium by 50% at 4 days post-MI by reducing apoptosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In a clinically relevant model of acute ischemia (30min)/reperfusion (24hr or 4 days) injury, we now demonstrate that ephrinA1-Fc reduces infarct size by 46% and completely preserves cardiac function (ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and chamber dimensions) in the short-term (24hrs post-MI) as well as long-term (4 days). At 24 hours post-MI, diminished serum inflammatory cell chemoattractants in ephrinA1-Fc-treated mice reduces recruitment of neutrophils and leukocytes into the myocardium. Differences in relative expression levels of EphA-Rs are described in the context of their putative role in mediating cardioprotection. Validation by Western blotting of selected targets from mass spectrometry analyses of pooled samples of left ventricular tissue homogenates from mice that underwent 30min ischemia and 24hr of reperfusion (I/R) indicates that ephrinA1-Fc administration alters several regulators of signaling pathways that attenuate apoptosis, promote autophagy, and shift from FA metabolism in favor of increased glycolysis to optimize anaerobic ATP production. Taken together, reduced injury is due a combination of adaptive metabolic reprogramming, improved cell survival, and decreased inflammatory cell recruitment, suggesting that ephrinA1-Fc enhances the capacity of the heart to withstand an ischemic insult."
https://openalex.org/W2773515731,"Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) is a potent vaccine candidate against tuberculosis (TB) as it has demonstrated significant protection in animal models of tuberculosis as well as in clinical trials. Higher protective efficacy of MIP against TB as compared to BCG provoked the efforts to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MIP mediated protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Autophagy, initially described as a cell survival mechanism during starvation, also plays a key role in host resistance to M.tb. Virulent mycobacteria like M.tb, suppresses host autophagy response to increase its survival in macrophages. Since mycobacterial species have been shown to vary widely in their autophagy-inducing properties, in the present study, we examined the autophagy inducing efficacy of MIP and its role in MIP-mediated protection against M.tb. MIP was found to be potent inducer of autophagy in macrophages. Induced autophagy was responsible for reversal of the phagosome maturation block and phagolysosome fusion inhibition in M.tb infected macrophages, which ultimately lead to significantly enhanced clearance of M.tb from the macrophages. This is an important study which further delineated the underlying mechanisms for significant immunotherapeutic activity observed in TB patients / animal models of tuberculosis, given MIP therapy along with chemotherapy."

Yet, there are few interventions that target depressive symptoms and HIV risk for people who use drugs (PWUD). This study was a randomized controlled trial of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and HIV prevention intervention to reduce depressive symptoms, injection risk behaviors and increase condom use in a sample of urban people who used heroin or cocaine in the prior 6 months. A total of 315 individuals aged 18-55, who self-reported at least one HIV drug and sex risk behavior and scored ≥16 and <40 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale were randomized using a two-block design, stratified by sex to ensure equivalent numbers, to a 10 session intervention arm (n = 162) or a single session control arm (n = 153). The outcomes of interest were decreases in CES-D score and injection risk behaviors and increases in condom use. The sample was majority African American (85%) and unemployed (94%). Nearly half (47%) reported injection in the prior 6 months and only 19% were taking medication for depression. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months. Retention at 12 months was 94%. Intervention arm was associated with statistically significantly lower CES-D score at 12 month compared to control. No differences were observed between arms in injection risk. At 6 month, intervention was associated with greater odds of condom use with non-main partner. These findings suggest the potential role of the integrated intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, but weak impact on HIV risk. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the title Neighborhoods, Networks, Depression, and HIV Risk number NCT01380613."
https://openalex.org/W2774827079,"Introduction Nutrition labels have been promoted for nearly two decades in Thailand to educate people about healthy eating and to combat nutrient-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). But little is known about how nutrition labels are experienced and whether they are linked with better health. Our objective was to investigate the associations between nutrition label experience, obesity and nutrient-related NCDs in Thai consumers. Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken with a nationwide cohort of 42,750 distance learning Thai adult students enrolled in an Open University in 2013. We measured exposure as nutrition label experience (read, understand, use). Health outcomes were high blood pressure, high blood lipids, and high Body Mass Index (overweight at risk and obesity). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between nutrition label experience and health outcome adjusting for sociodemographic attributes, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake. Results Frequent nutrition label use varied by cohort attributes and health outcomes and was least for those with low physical activity and high blood pressure. Being male, older, an urban resident or with low physical activity was associated with increasing high blood pressure and high blood lipids. Compared to those who read, understand and use nutrition labels, participants who did not (read, understand, and use), were more likely to report high blood pressure (Adjusted Odds Ratio 1.33; 1.17–1.51), high blood lipids (AOR 1.26; 1.14–1.39), and obesity (AOR 1.23; 1.13–1.33), but were not more likely to be overweight at risk (AOR 1.06; 0.97–1.16). Conclusions We found cross-sectional associations between low nutrition label experience and increased likelihood of high blood pressure, high blood lipids, and obesity among Thai adults. Nutrition label education should be promoted as part of a public health approach to appropriate food choices and better lifestyles to reduce obesity and nutrient-related NCDs."

Greasy spot-like symptoms were frequently observed in humid citrus-growing regions in Panama as well as in semi-arid areas in Spain, but disease aetiology was unknown. Citrus-growing areas in Panama and Spain were surveyed and isolates of Mycosphaerellaceae were obtained from citrus greasy spot lesions. A selection of isolates from Panama (n = 22) and Spain (n = 16) was assembled based on their geographical origin, citrus species, and affected tissue. The isolates were characterized based on multi-locus DNA (ITS and EF-1α) sequence analyses, morphology, growth at different temperatures, and independent pathogenicity tests on the citrus species most affected in each country. Reference isolates and sequences were also included in the analysis. Isolates from Panama were identified as Z. citri-griseum complex, and others from Spain attributed to Amycosphaerella africana. Isolates of the Z. citri-griseum complex had a significantly higher optimal growth temperature (26.8°C) than those of A. africana (19.3°C), which corresponded well with their actual biogeographical range. The isolates of the Z. citri-griseum complex from Panama induced typical greasy spot symptoms in ‘Valencia’ sweet orange plants and the inoculated fungi were reisolated. No symptoms were observed in plants of the ‘Ortanique’ tangor inoculated with A. africana. These results demonstrate the presence of citrus greasy spot, caused by Z. citri-griseum complex, in Panama whereas A. africana was associated with greasy spot-like symptoms in Spain."

In this study, we first predicted by software that the multiple proteins of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) could be sumoylated. Next, we confirmed that Nsp1β, Nsp4, Nsp9, Nsp10 and nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV could interact with the sole SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and Ubc9 could be co-localized with Nsp1β, Nsp4, Nsp9 and Nsp10 in the cytoplasm, while with N protein in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Finally, we demonstrated that N protein could be sumoylated by either SUMO1 or SUMO2/3. In addition, the overexpression of Ubc9 could inhibit viral genomic replication at early period of PRRSV infection and the knockdown of Ubc9 by siRNA could promote the virus replication. These findings reveal the SUMOylation property of PRRSV N protein and the involvement of Ubc9 in PRRSV replication through interaction with multiple proteins of PRRSV. To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating the interplay between SUMO modification system and PRRSV."

To investigate brain activation changes during semantic integration, a sample of forty-eight 25-75 year-old adults read sentences with high cloze (HC) and low cloze (LC) probability while functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted. Significant age-related reduction of cloze effect (LC vs. HC) was found in several regions, especially the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), which play an important role in semantic integration. Moreover, when accounting for global gray matter volume reduction, the age-cloze correlation in the left MFG and right IFG was absent. The results suggest that brain structural atrophy may disrupt brain response in aging brains, which then show less brain engagement in semantic integration."
https://openalex.org/W2775199657,"Background Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome contributes to adverse outcomes in advanced heart failure (AdHF) patients after mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation and is associated with aberrant leukocyte activity. We tested the hypothesis that preoperative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression profiles (GEP) can predict early postoperative improvement or non-improvement in patients undergoing MCS implantation. We believe this information may be useful in developing prognostic biomarkers. Methods & design We conducted a study with 29 patients undergoing MCS-surgery in a tertiary academic medical center from 2012 to 2014. PBMC samples were collected one day before surgery (day -1). Clinical data was collected on day -1 and day 8 postoperatively. Patients were classified by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Model of End-stage Liver Disease Except INR score (measured eight days after surgery): Group I = improving (both scores improved from day -1 to day 8, n = 17) and Group II = not improving (either one or both scores did not improve from day -1 to day 8, n = 12). RNA-sequencing was performed on purified mRNA and analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing Strand. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Mann-Whitney test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Preoperative DEGs were used to construct a support vector machine algorithm to predict Group I vs. Group II membership. Results Out of 28 MCS-surgery patients alive 8 days postoperatively, one-year survival was 88% in Group I and 27% in Group II. We identified 28 preoperative DEGs between Group I and II, with an average 93% prediction accuracy. Out of 105 DEGs identified preoperatively between year 1 survivors and non-survivors, 12 genes overlapped with the 28 predictive genes. Conclusions In AdHF patients following MCS implantation, preoperative PBMC-GEP predicts early changes in organ function scores and correlates with long-term outcomes. Therefore, gene expression lends itself to outcome prediction and warrants further studies in larger longitudinal cohorts."

Glycoalkaloid biosynthesis is influenced by plant genetic and environmental conditions. Although many studies have shown that light is an important factor affecting glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the specific mechanism is currently unknown. Chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis depend on light signal transduction and share some intermediate metabolites with the glycoalkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Here, we used virus-induced gene silencing to silence genes encoding phytoene desaturase (PDS) and magnesium chelatase (CHLI and CHLH) to reduce chlorophyll and carotenoid levels in eggplant leaves. Quantification of carotenoid and chlorophyll levels is analyzed by LC/PDA/APCI/MS and semipolar metabolite profiling by LC/HESI/MS. Notably, the resulting lines showed decreases in glycoalkaloid production. We further found that the expression of some genes involved in the production of glycoalkaloids and other metabolites were suppressed in these silenced lines. Our results indicate that photosynthetic pigment accumulation affects steroidal glycoalkaloid biosynthesis in eggplant leaves. This finding lays the foundation for reducing the levels of endogenous antinutritional compounds in crops."
https://openalex.org/W2775280729,"The cAMP/PKA intracellular signaling pathway is launched by adenylyl cyclase (AC) conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent activation of PKA. Although this pathway is very well known in insect physiology, there is little to no information on it in some very small pest insects, such as the brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stål. BPH is a destructive pest responsible for tremendous crop losses in rice cropping systems. We are investigating the potentials of novel pest management technologies from RNA interference perspective. Based on analysis of transcriptomic data, the BPH AC like-9 gene (NlAC9) was up-regulated in post-mating females, which led us to pose the hypothesis that NlAC9 is a target gene that would lead to reduced BPH fitness and populations. Targeting NlAC9 led to substantially decreased soluble ovarian protein content, yeast-like symbiont abundance, and vitellogenin gene expression, accompanied with stunted ovarian development and body size. Eggs laid were decreased and oviposition period shortened. Taken together, our findings indicated that NlAC9 exerted pronounced effects on female fecundity, growth and longevity, which strongly supports our hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2775418601,"Studies have indicated that consistent or well-constrained (relatively low variability) carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios exist in large-scale ecosystems, including both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Little is known about the C, N and P stoichiometric ratios that exist in the soils and plants of Chenier Island in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We examined the distribution patterns and relationships of C, N and P stoichiometry in the soils and plants of Chenier Island, as well as the potential influences of the island's micro-geomorphology. Based on a study of four soil profile categories and Phragmites australis and Suaeda heteroptera plant tissues, our results showed that micro-geomorphology could leave a distinct imprint on the soil and plant elemental stoichiometry of Chenier Island; significant variation in the atomic C:N:P ratios (RCNP) existed in soils and plants, indicating that the RCNP values in both the soil and plants are not well constrained at the Chenier Island scale. RCN and RCP in Chenier Island soils were high, whereas the RNP values were comparatively low, indicating that the ecosystems of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by N and P. However, the RNP values in P. australis and S. heteroptera plant tissues were high, suggesting that the plants of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by P. Finally, we suggest that soil and plant N:P ratios may be good indicators of the soil and plant nutrient status during soil development and plant growth, which could be a useful reference for restoring the degraded soils of Chenier Island."
https://openalex.org/W2949123117,"Flying lizards of the genus Draco are renowned for their gliding ability, using an aerofoil formed by winglike patagial membranes and supported by elongated thoracic ribs. It remains unknown, however, how these lizards manoeuvre during flight. Here, I present the results of a study on the aerial behaviour of Dussumier's Flying Lizard (Draco dussumieri) and show that Draco attaches the forelimbs to the leading edge of the patagium while airborne, forming a hitherto unknown type of composite wing. The attachment of the forelimbs to the patagium suggests that that aerofoil is controlled through movements of the forelimbs. One major advantage for the lizards is that the forelimbs retain their complete range of movement and functionality for climbing and running when not used as a part of the wing. These findings not only shed a new light on the flight of Draco but also have implications for the interpretation of gliding performance in fossil species."

The functionality of both elements of the TA system was demonstrated when expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the predicted structure of the toxin is very similar to those of well-known zeta-toxins, leading to the definition of a type II TA system similar to epsilon/zeta TA systems in strains that are closely related to M. chelonae."
https://openalex.org/W2773020710,"We aimed to determine the effect of low dietary energy on intestinal phosphate transport and the possible underlying mechanism to explain the long-term effects of early dietary energy restriction and non-phytate phosphorus (NPP). A 2 × 3 factorial experiment, consisting of 2 energy levels and 3 NPP levels, was conducted. Broiler growth performance, intestinal morphology in 0-21 days and 22-35 days, type IIb sodium-phosphate co-transporter (NaPi-IIb) mRNA expression, adenylate purine concentrations in the duodenum, and phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK-α) activity in 0-21 days were determined. The following results were obtained. (1) Low dietary energy (LE) induced a high feed conversion ratio (FCR) and significantly decreased body weight gain in young broilers, but LE induced significantly higher compensatory growth in low NPP (LP) groups than in the high or medium NPP groups (HP and MP). (2) LE decreased the villus height (VH) in the intestine, and LE-HP resulted in the lowest crypt depth (CD) and the highest VH:CD ratio in the initial phase. However, in the later period, the LE-LP group showed an increased VH:CD ratio and decreased CD in the intestine. (3) LE increased ATP synthesis and decreased AMP:ATP ratio in the duodenal mucosa of chickens in 0-21 days, and LP diet increased ATP synthesis and adenylate energy charges but decreased AMP production and AMP:ATP ratio. (4) LE led to weaker AMPK phosphorylation, higher mTOR phosphorylation, and higher NaPi-IIb mRNA expression. Thus, LE and LP in the early growth phase had significant compensatory and interactive effect on later growth and intestinal development in broilers. The effect might be relevant to energy status that LE leads to weaker AMPK phosphorylation, causing a lower inhibitory action toward mTOR phosphorylation. This series of events stimulates NaPi-IIb mRNA expression. Our findings provide a theoretical basis and a new perspective on intestinal phosphate transport regulation, with potential applications in broiler production."
https://openalex.org/W2774370834,"The popularity of fluorescence microscopy arises from the inherent mode of action, where the fluorescence emission from probes is used to visualize selected features on a presumed dark background. However, the background is rarely truly dark, and image processing and analysis is needed to enhance the fluorescent signal that is ascribed to the selected feature. The image acquisition is facilitated by using considerable illumination, bright probes at a relatively high concentration in order to make the fluorescent signal significantly more intense than the background signal. Here, we present two methods for completely removing the background signal in spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy. The methodology is applicable for all probes with narrow and well-defined emission bands (Full width half-maximum < 20 nm). Here, we use two lanthanide based probes exploiting the narrow emission lines of europium(III) and terbium(III) ions. We used a model system with zeolites doped with lanthanides immobilized in a polymer stained with several fluorescent dyes regularly used in bioimaging. After smoothing the spectral data recorded in each pixel, they are differentiated. Method I is based on the direct sum of the gradient, while method II resolves the fluorescent signal by subtracting a background calculated via the gradient. Both methods improve signal-to-background ratio significantly and we suggest that spectral imaging of lanthanide-centered emission can be used as a tool to obtain absolute contrast in bioimaging."

Methods The RBANS battery and additional tests were administered to 47 vehicle collision repair and 51 comparison workers randomly selected from a previous questionnaire study. Results Collision repair workers performed lower on tests of attention (digit span backwards: -1.5, 95% CI -2.4, -0.5; digit span total: -1.7, CI -3.3, -0.0; coding: -6.1, CI -9.9, -2.8; total attention scale: -9.3, CI -15.9, -2.8) and the RBANS total scale (-5.1, CI -9.1, -1.2). Additional tests also showed deficits in visual attention and reaction time (Trails B: -11.5, CI -22.4, -0.5) and motor speed/dexterity (coin rotation dominant hand & non-dominant: -2.9, CI -5.3, -0.4 and -3.1, CI -5.6, -0.7 respectively). The strongest associations were observed in panel beaters. Applying dichotomised RBANS outcomes based on the lowest percentile scores of a normative comparison group showed strongly increased risks for attention (5th percentile: OR 20.1, 95% CI 1.5, 263.3; 10th percentile: 8.8, CI 1.7, 46.2; and 20th percentile: 5.1, CI 1.5, 17.6, respectively). Those employed in the industry for ≤ 17 years (the median work duration) generally had lower scores in the attention domain scale and RBANS total scale compared to those employed >17 years suggesting a healthy worker survivor bias, but trends were inconsistent for other domains. Conclusions This study has found significant deficits in cognitive performance in collision repair workers despite low current airborne exposures in New Zealand."

Furthermore, in many applications, besides vector attributes information, pairwise relations (graph information) are also available. Thus we integrate EKM with Normalized Cut graph clustering into a single clustering formulation. Finally, we provide several useful matrix inequalities which are useful for matrix formulations of learning models. Based on these results, we prove the correctness and the convergence of EKM algorithms. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed EKM and its integrated model."
https://openalex.org/W2771507838,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain structure for decision making, behavioural flexibility and working memory. Neurons in PFC encode relevant stimuli through changes in their firing rate, although the metabolic cost of spiking activity puts strong constrains to neural codes based on firing rate modulation. Thus, how PFC neural populations code relevant information in an efficient way is not clearly understood. To address this issue we made single unit recordings in the PFC of rats performing a GO/NOGO discrimination task and analysed how entropy between pairs of neurons changes during cue presentation. We found that entropy rises only during reward-predicting cues. Moreover, this change in entropy occurred along an increase in the efficiency of the whole process.
