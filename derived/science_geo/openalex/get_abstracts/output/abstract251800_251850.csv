https://openalex.org/W2015398239,"The molecular machinery that governs circadian rhythmicity comprises proteins whose interplay generates time-specific transcription of clock genes. The role of chromatin remodeling in a physiological setting such as the circadian clock is yet unclear. We show that the protein CLOCK, a central component of the circadian pacemaker, has histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. CLOCK shares homology with acetyl-coenzyme A binding motifs within the MYST family of HATs. CLOCK displays high sequence similarity to ACTR, a member of SRC family of HATs, with which it shares also enzymatic specificity for histones H3 and H4. BMAL1, the heterodimerization partner of CLOCK, enhances HAT function. The HAT activity of CLOCK is essential to rescue circadian rhythmicity and activation of clock genes in Clock mutant cells. Identification of CLOCK as a novel type of DNA binding HAT reveals that chromatin remodeling is crucial for the core clock mechanism and identifies unforeseen links between histone acetylation and cellular physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2025453970,"Cell-cell communication via Wnt signals represents a fundamental means by which animal development and homeostasis are controlled. The identification of components of the Wnt pathway is reaching saturation for the transduction process in receiving cells but is incomplete concerning the events occurring in Wnt-secreting cells. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel Wnt pathway component, Wntless (Wls/Evi), and show that it is required for Wingless-dependent patterning processes in Drosophila, for MOM-2-governed polarization of blastomeres in C. elegans, and for Wnt3a-mediated communication between cultured human cells. In each of these cases, Wls is acting in the Wnt-sending cells to promote the secretion of Wnt proteins. Since loss of Wls function has no effect on other signaling pathways yet appears to impede all the Wnt signals we analyzed, we propose that Wls represents an ancient partner for Wnts dedicated to promoting their secretion into the extracellular milieu."

Wnt proteins are secreted factors that activate target-gene expression in both a short- and long-range manner. Currently, little is known about how Wnts are released from cells and which factors facilitate their secretion. Here, we identify a conserved multipass transmembrane protein, Evenness interrupted (Evi/Wls), through an RNAi survey for transmembrane proteins involved in Drosophila Wingless (Wg) signaling. During development, evi mutants have patterning defects that phenocopy wg loss-of-function alleles and fail to express Wg target genes. evi's function is evolutionarily conserved as depletion of its human homolog disrupts Wnt signaling in human cells. Epistasis experiments and clonal analysis place evi in the Wg-producing cell. Our results show that Wg is retained by evi mutant cells and suggest that evi is the founding member of a gene family specifically required for Wg/Wnt secretion.

Our results show that Wg is retained by evi mutant cells and suggest that evi is the founding member of a gene family specifically required for Wg/Wnt secretion. Many patterning decisions during development are controlled by morphogens, secreted signaling molecules that inform cells about their relative position within a tissue. It has been proposed that these morphogens form gradients with the highest activity acting on cells immediately adjacent to the source of signal production, leading to differential target-gene expression across the tissue (reviewed in Cadigan, 2002Cadigan K.M. Regulating morphogen gradients in the Drosophila wing.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Signaling molecules of the Wnt, Hedgehog (Hh), and TGF-β families can spread over many cell diameters to activate target-gene expression in cells far away from the source of production (Lawrence and Struhl, 1996Lawrence P.A.

Consequently, the localized expression of such a morphogen can function as an organizing center that determines the growth and patterning of the surrounding tissue (Basler and Struhl, 1994Basler K.

Drosophila Wingless (Wg) is a founding member of the Wnt family and plays multiple roles during embryonic and larval development (reviewed in Seto and Bellen, 2004Seto E.S. Bellen H.J.

Wg activates a signal-transduction cascade by binding to its receptor complex consisting of members of the Frizzled (Fz) protein family and the coreceptor LRP6/Arrow (Arr) (Bhanot et al., 1996Bhanot P.

Upon activation of Dishevelled (Dsh) and recruitment of Axin to the plasma membrane, the Armadillo (Arm; the Drosophila homolog of β-catenin) degradation complex is inhibited, and Arm accumulates in the cytoplasm. After translocation to the nucleus, Arm binds Pan/TCF proteins and activates transcription of Wg-responsive target genes (Axelrod et al., 1998Axelrod J.D. Miller J.R. Shulman J.M. Moon R.T.

Wg can activate its target genes in a short- or long-range manner. In wing imaginal discs, Wg is secreted by a narrow stripe of cells at the dorsoventral border and activates the expression of short-range targets, such as senseless (sens), up to 4 cells away from the source (Nolo et al., 2000Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J. Senseless, a Zn finger transcription factor, is necessary and sufficient for sensory organ development in Drosophila.Cell. 2000; 102: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Expression of long-range targets, such as distal-less (dll) or vestigial (vg), requires lower levels of Wg and occurs as far as 30 cell diameters away from the signal-producing source (Lawrence et al., 1996Lawrence P.A.

Cells at the dorsoventral border that receive high levels of Wg give rise to the wing margin. Expression of sens, for example, is necessary for the generation of sensory organs such as the wing-margin bristles (Nolo et al., 2000Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J.

How molecules with high membrane affinities such as Hh and Wg can be secreted and function over such long distances remains poorly understood. Similarly to Hh proteins, Wg is attached to membranes presumably via covalent lipid modifications (Willert et al., 2003Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nusse R.

Novel lipid modifications of secreted protein signals.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 891-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation has been proposed to target Wg to secretory vesicles that deliver the ligand to specialized microdomains at the apical plasma membrane where it is secreted (Zhai et al., 2004Zhai L. Chaturvedi D. Cumberledge S. Drosophila wnt-1 undergoes a hydrophobic modification and is targeted to lipid rafts, a process that requires porcupine.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33220-33227Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition to posttranslational modifications, endocytosis and degradation play a role in regulating the extracellular levels of Wg available for signaling (Piddini et al., 2005Piddini E. Marshall F. Dubois L. Hirst E. Vincent J.P.

Here, we present evenness interrupted (evi), a conserved segment polarity gene required for Wg signaling in cultured cells and in vivo. evi was found in an RNAi survey for transmembrane proteins involved in Wg signaling. We show that Evi is a member of a previously uncharacterized protein family and that its human homolog is required for Wnt signal transduction in human cells. In Drosophila, clonal analysis demonstrates that evi is required for Wg but not for Hh target-gene expression. Epistasis studies and clonal analysis place evi in the Wg-producing cell. We show that Wg is retained by evi mutant cells, suggesting that Evi is a member of a family of transmembrane proteins that specifically control the secretion of Wnt ligands.

To identify novel transmembrane proteins required for Wnt/Wg signaling, we performed an RNAi survey by examining the phenotypes of ∼2300 putative transmembrane proteins encoded by the Drosophila genome in a cell-based assay for Wg signaling activity (see Experimental Procedures). S2R+ and Kc167 cells were transfected with the Wnt-responsive LEF7-luc reporter (Giese et al., 1995Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Assembly and function of a TCR alpha enhancer complex is dependent on LEF-1-induced DNA bending and multiple protein-protein interactions.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and a Wg expression plasmid (pAc-wg), which induces the expression of the reporter gene approximately 40-fold relative to basal activity (data not shown). RNAi against positive regulators of Wg signaling reduces reporter-gene expression, while RNAi targeting negative regulators increases reporter activity (Figure 1A). Using dsRNAs from a genome-wide RNAi library (Boutros et al., 2004Boutros M. Kiger A.A. Armknecht S. Kerr K. Hild M. Koch B. Haas S.A. Consortium H.F. Paro R. Perrimon N. Genome-wide RNAi analysis of growth and viability in Drosophila cells.Science. 2004; 303: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, Hild et al., 2003Hild M. Beckmann B. Haas S.A. Koch B. Solovyev V. Busold C. Fellenberg K. Boutros M. Vingron M. Sauer F. et al.An integrated gene annotation and transcriptional profiling approach towards the full gene content of the Drosophila genome.Genome Biol. 2003; 5: R3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we assessed Wg signaling phenotypes in Kc167 cells after depletion of transcripts by RNAi. While the majority of dsRNAs used in the survey did not decrease reporter activity, four dsRNAs caused a significant reduction of the Wnt reporter signal. Among them, we found members of the family of frizzled receptors, fz and fz4, and the coreceptor lrp6/arr. In addition, we identified CG6210 (Figure 1B), which we named evenness interrupted (evi) due to its wing-margin phenotype (see below). The requirement of evi for Wg signaling was also confirmed in S2R+ cells (Figure 1C). To confirm that the RNAi phenotype of evi dsRNA was specifically due to evi depletion, we designed an independent dsRNA against the evi 3′UTR. Both ORF and 3′UTR dsRNAs reduce reporter activity by approximately 80% compared to control dsRNAs. Transfection of an Evi-EGFP expression construct (pAc-evi-EGFP) lacking the endogenous evi 3′UTR rescues the loss-of-function phenotype caused by the evi 3′UTR dsRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of pAc-evi-EGFP did not increase basal reporter activity and was not sufficient to rescue the phenotype of lrp6/arr dsRNA or the evi ORF dsRNA (Figure 1C). Together, these experiments show that the evi RNAi phenotype is specific and that evi is required for Wg signaling in cultured cells. The evi gene encodes two alternative transcripts for a 562 aa and a 594 aa protein. Database searches revealed that the predicted full-length protein belongs to a family of highly conserved proteins present in the genomes of metazoans from C. elegans to man. Interestingly, and in contrast to other factors in the Wnt signaling pathway, both vertebrate and invertebrate genomes appear to encode for only a single gene homologous to evi (Figure 2A). The Drosophila and human Evi proteins share 43% overall sequence identity. Sequence analysis predicts that evi encodes a type II transmembrane protein with eight membrane-spanning regions (Figure 2B). To examine the subcellular localization of Evi, an Evi-EGFP transgene was expressed in wing imaginal-disc cells. As shown in Figure 2C and in Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online, Evi-EGFP localizes primarily to the plasma membrane in vivo. Localization of Evi-EGFP at the plasma membrane was also seen in cultured S2R+ cells and human HEK293T cells (data not shown and Figure S1B). To determine whether the requirement of evi for Wnt signal transduction is conserved, we depleted the homolog of evi (hevi) in human cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with a Wnt reporter as previously described (van de Wetering et al., 1997van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. et al.Armadillo coactivates transcription driven by the product of the Drosophila segment polarity gene dTCF.Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar); expression plasmids for mouse Wnt1, mouse Fz8, or human LRP6; and siRNAs against β-catenin, lrp6, hevi, or GFP. As shown in Figure 2D, siRNAs directed against hevi reduce reporter activity to levels similar to those observed by siRNAs against β-catenin or lrp6. These experiments indicate that hevi is required for Wnt signaling in humans and that the function of evi in Wnt signaling is conserved. During Drosophila development, Wg signaling is required for the patterning of embryonic and larval tissues. In the Drosophila embryo, Wg protein is secreted from cells in posterior compartments of parasegments and is required for proper cell-fate determination. Specified cells secrete and pattern cuticular structures, so-called denticle belts, which alternate with naked regions. In wg mutants, this alternating pattern is disturbed and naked cuticle cell fate is suppressed, leading to a characteristic lawn of denticles (van den Heuvel et al., 1989van den Heuvel M. Nusse R. Johnston P. Lawrence P.A.

Martinez Arias A. Roles of wingless in patterning the larval epidermis of Drosophila.Development. 1991; 113: 471-485PubMed Google Scholar). Later, during patterning of wing imaginal discs, Wg is secreted from a small stripe of cells at the dorsoventral boundary and signals to nearby cells that give rise to adult structures, such as the wing margin (Neumann and Cohen, 1997Neumann C.J. Cohen S.M. Long-range action of Wingless organizes the dorsal-ventral axis of the Drosophila wing.Development. 1997; 124: 871-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; reviewed in Cadigan, 2002Cadigan K.M. Regulating morphogen gradients in the Drosophila wing.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To analyze evi function in vivo, we searched for insertions in the evi locus and identified the P element (EY01593) inserted in the 5′UTR (Bellen et al., 2004Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Examination of the wings of eviEY01593 homozygous flies shows that the P element insertion is associated with wing defects. These include reduced wing size and the loss of bristles at the posterior wing margin (Figure 3C). The phenotype is enhanced by the deficiency Df(3L)lxd6, which removes the evi locus (Figure 3D), and is reversible by precise excision of the P element (data not shown). This indicates that eviEY01593 phenotypes are due to the P element insertion in the evi locus. In order to further analyze the biological role of evi, we screened for evi null alleles after remobilization of the EY01593 P element. We recovered an imprecise excision, evi2, which removes 771 bp of the evi gene, including 627 bp encoding the N-terminal 209 amino acids (Figure 3A). evi2 mutant flies are homozygous pupal lethal. We assume that evi2 is a complete loss-of-function allele, as its phenotype is not enhanced by crossing evi2 over Df(3L)lxd6 (data not shown). A small number of zygotic evi2 mutants survive until late pupal stages (<2%), and those that do exhibit severe developmental defects such as the loss of leg structures and enlarged eyes indicative of Wg signaling defects (Campbell and Tomlinson, 1998Campbell G. Tomlinson A.

Freeman M. Control of Drosophila eye specification by Wingless signalling.Development. 2002; 129: 5313-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (Figure 4). The lethality and developmental phenotypes associated with the evi2 allele are rescued by expression of Evi-EGFP driven by the actin-Gal4 driver. Overexpression of Evi-EGFP in a wild-type genetic background does not result in visible phenotypes (data not shown). As in situ hybridization data on CG6210/evi show maternal expression (BDGP in situ database; Tomancak et al., 2002Tomancak P. Beaton A. Weiszmann R. Kwan E. Shu S. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Hartenstein V. Celniker S.E. Rubin G.M. Systematic determination of patterns of gene expression during Drosophila embryogenesis.Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (RESEARCH0088)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether evi2 mutants survive to pupal stages due to maternal contribution. We generated germline clones using the FRT-FLP technique (Chou and Perrimon, 1996Chou T.B. Perrimon N. The autosomal FLP-DFS technique for generating germline mosaics in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1673-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3F, evi2 mutants devoid of both maternal and zygotic transcripts die during embryogenesis with a severe segment polarity phenotype that phenocopies mutations in core Wg pathway components (Baker, 1988Baker N.E. Transcription of the segment-polarity gene wingless in the imaginal discs of Drosophila, and the phenotype of a pupal-lethal wg mutation.Development. 1988; 102: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar, Bejsovec and Martinez Arias, 1991Bejsovec A.

Wieschaus E. Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila.Nature. 1980; 287: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2825) Google Scholar). Since several components of Wnt/Fz pathways have been implicated both in the canonical and the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (reviewed in Klein and Mlodzik, 2005Klein T.J. Mlodzik M. Planar cell polarization: an emerging model points in the right direction.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we asked whether evi2 mutants have PCP defects. As shown in Figure 4, typical PCP phenotypes such as those caused by dsh1 could not be detected in evi2 pharate adults. Whereas bristles on dsh1 pharate adults were disorientated as typical for PCP phenotypes, nota bristles of evi2 mutants were aligned similar to wild-type flies. PCP defects were also not seen in evi2 mutant clones on wings (data not shown), suggesting that evi is specifically required for the canonical Wg pathway. Since loss of evi causes developmental defects reminiscent of wg loss-of-function phenotypes, we tested whether Wg target-gene expression is affected in evi mutant animals. The Wg target gene senseless (sens) is expressed at the dorsoventral boundary, where its expression depends on high levels of Wg, as well as in neuronal clusters on the notum anlage, independent of Wg (Nolo et al., 2000Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J. Senseless, a Zn finger transcription factor, is necessary and sufficient for sensory organ development in Drosophila.Cell. 2000; 102: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We observed that Wg-dependent expression of sens was abolished in evi2 mutant wing discs, whereas it was still expressed in the Wg-independent neuronal clusters (Figure 5B). In order to test the specificity of evi for Wg signaling, we stained wing discs containing evi2 mutant clones for the expression of the Hh target gene collier (col). col is expressed in anterior compartment cells adjacent to the A/P boundary (Vervoort et al., 1999Vervoort M. Crozatier M. Valle D. Vincent A. The COE transcription factor Collier is a mediator of short-range Hedgehog-induced patterning of the Drosophila wing.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In anterior evi2 clones at the A/P boundary (Figure 5) and in evi2 mutant discs (data not shown), col was still expressed, indicating that evi is required for Wg- but not Hh-target-gene expression. We also tested the effect of evi loss of function on JAK/STAT signaling. In induced cultured Drosophila cells responsive to JAK/STAT signaling, we depleted evi as well as two known regulators of JAK/STAT signaling, domeless and STAT92E (Muller et al., 2005Muller P. Kuttenkeuler D. Gesellchen V. Zeidler M.P. Boutros M. Identification of JAK/STAT signalling components by genome-wide RNA interference.Nature. 2005; 436: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), by RNAi. As shown in Figure 5E, knockdown of evi did not affect reporter activity, while RNAi against domeless or STAT92E reduced the pathway activity. Together with the in vivo phenotypes, this supports a model whereby evi is required not for multiple pathways but specifically for Wg signaling. We next set out to map where in the Wg pathway evi acts. In Drosophila cells, we activated Wg signaling by expression of Wg, Dsh, or LRP6ΔN, a constitutively active form of hLRP6. These factors were previously shown to activate the Wg pathway (Cong et al., 2004Cong F. Schweizer L. Varmus H. Wnt signals across the plasma membrane to activate the beta-catenin pathway by forming oligomers containing its receptors, Frizzled and LRP.Development. 2004; 131: 5103-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Yanagawa et al., 1995Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. The dishevelled protein is modified by wingless signaling in Drosophila.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). When we induced RNAi against evi, reporter activity was reduced in cells activated with Wg, but not in cells activated with LRP6ΔN or Dsh (Figure S3). In contrast, RNAi against arm, a pathway regulator acting downstream of dsh, resulted in reduced Wg reporter activity in all three cases. We therefore conclude that evi acts upstream of lrp6/arr and dsh in Wg signaling. We then tested whether evi regulates Wg signaling in the Wg-secreting or -receiving cell. We transfected the reporter constructs, depleted evi by RNAi, and activated Wg signaling in either an autocrine manner by cotransfection of pAc-wg or a paracrine manner by mixing the reporter-transfected cells with S2 cells that stably express GFP-Wg (Piddini et al., 2005Piddini E.

RNAi targeting evi reduced reporter activity in cells that were activated in an autocrine manner, but not in cells that received exogenous GFP-Wg. lrp6/arr dsRNA caused the reduction of reporter levels in both cell populations, suggesting that, unlike lrp6/arr, evi is required in the Wg-producing cell (Figure 6A). To test whether the evi human homolog hevi is also required in the ligand-secreting cell, hevi or lrp6 was depleted in HEK293T cells by RNAi, and Wnt signaling was activated by either cotransfection of the reporter constructs with an expression plasmid for mouse Wnt3a (autocrine) or incubation of the reporter-transfected cells in mouse Wnt3a-conditioned medium (paracrine). As shown in Figure 6B, knockdown of hevi by RNAi reduced reporter activity in cells that were activated in an autocrine manner, but not in cells that were treated with Wnt3a-conditioned medium. lrp6 knockdown led to the reduction of reporter levels in both cases, suggesting that, as in Drosophila, hevi is required in Wnt-producing cells in mammals. We then analyzed wing imaginal discs containing evi2 mutant clones for Wg target-gene expression. As shown in Figure 6C, Sens was detected in evi mutant cells close to the clonal border, whereas Sens expression was diminished in cells further away (see also Figure S4). This phenotype is similar to that of wg mutant clones (Figure 6D and Figure S4), indicating that evi acts in a cell-nonautonomous manner. Moreover, the analysis of dll, a Wg target gene that requires only low levels of signaling activity, was rescued in clones by surrounding wild-type tissue; clonal analyses of wgcx4 mutant alleles show the same phenotype (Figure S5). evi clones that do not overlap with the dorsoventral boundary express target genes normally, consistent with a model whereby evi is specifically required in Wg-producing cells. To test whether evi loss of function would affect the expression or distribution of Wg, we stained wing imaginal discs for Wg protein (Figure 7 and Figure S6). In order to detect total Wg, we used a staining protocol that involves permeabilization of the cells prior to incubation with the anti-Wg antibody (referred to as Wg (total)). In evi2 mutant clones, the intensity of the Wg signal is stronger than in adjacent wild-type tissue, suggesting that, in the absence of evi, Wg was still expressed but was retained in secreting cells (Figure 7 and Figure S7). Accumulation of Wg was also seen in evi2 mutant embryos (Figure S6), suggesting that evi acts in Wg-producing cells. The phenotype is specific for Wg as Hh distribution was not changed in evi2 mutant clones (Figure S8). To test whether Wg accumulates in evi2 mutant cells, we stained wing imaginal discs containing evi2 mutant clones for extracellular Wg (Strigini and Cohen, 2000Strigini M. Cohen S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2164945218,"Plants and animals possess innate immune systems to prevent infections and are effectively “nonhosts” for most potential pathogens. The molecular mechanisms underlying nonhost immunity in plants remain obscure. In Arabidopsis, nonhost/nonpathogenic Pseudomonas syringae sustains but pathogenic P. syringae suppresses early MAMP (microbe-associated molecular pattern) marker-gene activation. We performed a cell-based genetic screen of virulence factors and identified AvrPto and AvrPtoB as potent and unique suppressors of early-defense gene transcription and MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling. Unlike effectors of mammalian pathogens, AvrPto and AvrPtoB intercept multiple MAMP-mediated signaling upstream of MAPKKK at the plasma membrane linked to the receptor. In transgenic Arabidopsis, AvrPto blocks early MAMP signaling and enables nonhost P. syringae growth. Deletions of avrPto and avrPtoB from pathogenic P. syringae reduce its virulence. The studies reveal a fundamental role of MAMP signaling in nonhost immunity, and a novel action of type III effectors from pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2117996979,"The proto-oncogene AKT (also known as PKB) is activated in many human cancers, mostly owing to loss of the PTEN tumour suppressor. In such tumours, AKT becomes enriched at cell membranes where it is activated by phosphorylation. Yet many targets inhibited by phosphorylated AKT (for example, the FOXO transcription factors) are nuclear; it has remained unclear how relevant nuclear phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) function is for tumorigenesis. Here we show that the PMLtumour suppressor prevents cancer by inactivating pAKT inside the nucleus. We find in a mouse model that Pml loss markedly accelerates tumour onset, incidence and progression in Pten-heterozygous mutants, and leads to female sterility with features that recapitulate the phenotype of Foxo3a knockout mice. We show that Pml deficiency on its own leads to tumorigenesis in the prostate, a tissue that is exquisitely sensitive to pAkt levels, and demonstrate that Pml specifically recruits the Akt phosphatase PP2a as well as pAkt into Pml nuclear bodies. Notably, we find that Pml-null cells are impaired in PP2a phosphatase activity towards Akt, and thus accumulate nuclear pAkt. As a consequence, the progressive reduction in Pml dose leads to inactivation of Foxo3a-mediated transcription of proapoptotic Bim and the cell cycle inhibitor p27(kip1). Our results demonstrate that Pml orchestrates a nuclear tumour suppressor network for inactivation of nuclear pAkt, and thus highlight the importance of AKT compartmentalization in human cancer pathogenesis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2054079210,"Using functional and proteomic screens of proteins that regulate the Cdc42 GTPase, we have identified a network of protein interactions that center around the Cdc42 RhoGAP Rich1 and organize apical polarity in MDCK epithelial cells. Rich1 binds the scaffolding protein angiomotin (Amot) and is thereby targeted to a protein complex at tight junctions (TJs) containing the PDZ-domain proteins Pals1, Patj, and Par-3. Regulation of Cdc42 by Rich1 is necessary for maintenance of TJs, and Rich1 is therefore an important mediator of this polarity complex. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain of Amot, with which it binds Rich1, is necessary for localization to apical membranes and is required for Amot to relocalize Pals1 and Par-3 to internal puncta. We propose that Rich1 and Amot maintain TJ integrity by the coordinate regulation of Cdc42 and by linking specific components of the TJ to intracellular protein trafficking.

We propose that Rich1 and Amot maintain TJ integrity by the coordinate regulation of Cdc42 and by linking specific components of the TJ to intracellular protein trafficking. Dynamic cellular organization depends on the selective interactions of signaling proteins. These interactions are commonly mediated by specific protein domains and are frequently controlled by protein phosphorylation and GTPases that toggle between active and inactive conformations. These simple devices can be exploited to build multiprotein networks that yield complex properties, such as cell polarity. Here, we explore a novel protein complex that is integrated with the mammalian epithelial polarity network and influences the activity of the Cdc42 GTPase, the formation of tight junctions (TJs), and cell morphology. The plasma membrane of epithelial cells is asymmetrically organized into apical and basolateral regions, which have distinct protein and lipid compositions and are separated in vertebrates by a dense network of protein strands mainly composed of claudins and occludins. These apical strands encircle the cell and make lateral contact with neighboring cells, thus forming the TJ, which provides a paracellular barrier to the movement of ions (Yeaman et al., 1999Yeaman C. Grindstaff K.K. Nelson W.J. New perspectives on mechanisms involved in generating epithelial cell polarity.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 73-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Recent data have identified a conserved series of protein complexes that control cell polarity in metazoans. In epithelial cells, these complexes are spatially segregated along the apical-basolateral axis and impart discrete properties to separate regions of the cell. Distinct complexes also interact with one another, either to promote an aspect of polarity or to restrict the actions of polarity proteins to particular domains of the cell. The protein-protein interactions in this polarity network are typically mediated by PDZ domains and are regulated by serine/threonine phosphorylation and Rho-family GTPases. This is exemplified by two dynamic protein assemblies, the Crumbs and Par-3 complexes, which are important for establishing and maintaining apical junctions and defining apical identity (Macara, 2004Macara I.G.

Composition and function of PDZ protein complexes during cell polarization.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F377-F387Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mammalian Crumbs3 is an apically localized transmembrane protein that binds through a C-terminal motif to the PDZ domain of Pals1 (a MAGUK protein) or Patj (a protein with ten PDZ domains) (Roh and Margolis, 2003Roh M.H. Margolis B. Composition and function of PDZ protein complexes during cell polarization.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F377-F387Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Patj and Pals1 also interact directly through heterodimerization of their N-terminal L27 domains (Roh et al., 2002Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R.

Mammalian Patj also binds the TJ components ZO-3 and claudin through its PDZ domains and can thereby be recruited into the TJ complex. In mammalian epithelia, Pals1 (Straight et al., 2004Straight S.W. Shin K. Fogg V.C. Fan S. Liu C.J. Roh M. Margolis B. Loss of PALS1 expression leads to tight junction and polarity defects.Mol. Biol.

Par-3 itself contains three PDZ domains, through which it associates with the PDZ domain of Par-6 (Joberty et al., 2000Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G.

Structure of Cdc42 in a complex with the GTPase-binding domain of the cell polarity protein, Par6.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Pals1 provides a direct link between the Crumbs and Par-6/Par-3 complexes (Wang et al., 2004Wang Q. Hurd T.W. Margolis B. Tight junction protein Par6 interacts with an evolutionarily conserved region in the amino terminus of PALS1/stardust.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30715-30721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is a member of the Rho GTPase family, whose members interact with effectors when bound to GTP and terminate signaling upon GTP hydrolysis. Cdc42 signaling is therefore enhanced by guanine exchange factors (GEFs) that stimulate nucleotide release and consequent GTP binding and is inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that promote nucleotide hydrolysis (Nobes and Hall, 1994Nobes C. Hall A. Regulation and function of the Rho subfamily of small GTPases.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and proteins that regulate its GTPase cycle potentially act early in establishing cell polarity. Cdc42 was first identified in yeast as a mutant allele that disrupts bud formation and polarized distribution of the actin cytoskeleton (Johnson and Pringle, 1990Johnson D.I. Pringle J.R. Molecular characterization of CDC42, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene involved in the development of cell polarity.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, expression of constitutively active (CA) or dominant-negative (DN) Cdc42 mutants after cellularization causes defects in epithelialization and a loss of polarity (Hutterer et al., 2004Hutterer A. Betschinger J. Petronczki M. Knoblich J.A. Sequential roles of Cdc42, Par-6, aPKC, and Lgl in the establishment of epithelial polarity during Drosophila embryogenesis.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of either CA or DN Cdc42 in mammalian MDCK epithelial cells disrupts polarity by inducing increased paracellular permeability and mixing of apical and basolateral components, consistent with a disruption of TJs (Rojas et al., 2001Rojas R. Ruiz W.G. Leung S.M. Jou T.S. Apodaca G. Cdc42-dependent modulation of tight junctions and membrane protein traffic in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2257-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because Cdc42 participates in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell division, microtubule orientation, actin reorganization, and protein trafficking (Johnson, 1999Johnson D.I. Cdc42: An essential Rho-type GTPase controlling eukaryotic cell polarity.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to delineate the precise role of Cdc42 in epithelial polarity using approaches that impact global Cdc42 signaling. Furthermore, Cdc42 belongs to a subset of Rho GTPases that potentially have overlapping functions (Czuchra et al., 2005Czuchra A. Wu X. Meyer H. van Hengel J. Schroeder T. Geffers R. Rottner K. Brakebusch C. Cdc42 is not essential for filopodium formation, directed migration, cell polarization, and mitosis in fibroblastoid cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One approach to this conundrum involves analysis of the GEFs and GAPs that regulate Cdc42 activity. Rho-family GEFs and GAPs are more numerous than the GTPases themselves and typically contain interaction domains through which they are directed to specific subcellular locations and may recruit upstream regulators, downstream targets, and cytoplasmic scaffolds (Peck et al., 2002Peck J. Douglas 4th, G. Wu C.H. Burbelo P.D. Human RhoGAP domain-containing proteins: structure, function and evolutionary relationships.FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 27-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Rossman et al., 2005Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). As a consequence, specific Rho GEFs and GAPs may each target a discrete subpopulation of Cdc42 that undertakes a specialized function. We therefore reasoned that we could probe Cdc42 function at TJs by studying its local regulators. In a systematic screen of RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs, we identified a Cdc42-selective GAP, Rich1, that localizes to TJs and adherens junctions (AJs), associates with components of the apical-polarity network, and maintains the integrity of TJs in epithelial cells through its regulation of Cdc42. By examining the binding partners of proteins that associate with Rich1, we define a series of overlapping polarity complexes that regulate the maintenance of TJs. To identify modulators of Cdc42, we transiently expressed >50 putative mammalian RhoGEFs and 50 RhoGAPS in HEK293T and/or NIH 3T3 cells and measured their intracellular specificity for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based probes (data not shown). Proteins that altered the GTPase cycle of Cdc42 were analyzed in parallel for binding to known polarity proteins by stably expressing each RhoGEF or RhoGAP in a HEK293T-derived (Phoenix) cell line and analyzing their coprecipitating proteins by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Together, these assays identified Rich1 as a Cdc42 GAP that associates with apical polarity components (Figure 1). We analyzed Rich1 GAP activity in epithelial cells by two approaches. Using Raichu FRET probes (Itoh et al., 2002Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Activation of rac and cdc42 video imaged by fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based single-molecule probes in the membrane of living cells.Mol. Cell.

Activity of Rho-family GTPases during cell division as visualized with FRET-based probes.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), full-length (FL) Rich1 reduced the fraction of Cdc42 bound to GTP in 293T cells but had no measurable effect on Rac1 or RhoA (Figure 1A). We also analyzed the effects of Rich1 on endogenous levels of GTP bound Cdc42 and Rac1 in MDCK cells by precipitation with the GTPase binding domain (GBD) of the Pak kinase. For this purpose, we used clonal MDCK cells that stably overexpressed wild-type (wt) Rich1, a GAP-deficient mutant of Rich1 (R288A), or a control line. wt Rich1 reduced the levels of Cdc42 GTP by over 70% with no effect on Rac1. The GAP-deficient mutant of Rich1 modestly elevated Cdc42-GTP with no significant effect on the level of Rac1-GTP (Figures 1B and 1C). Taken together, Rich1 has selective GAP activity toward Cdc42 in epithelial cells. Rich1 (also termed Nadrin) contains an N-terminal BAR domain (Richnau et al., 2004Richnau N. Fransson A. Farsad K. Aspenstrom P. RICH-1 has a BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvsp domain responsible for binding to membrane lipids and tubulation of liposomes.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 1034-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a RhoGAP domain, and an ∼300 amino acid C-terminal tail with multiple proline-rich motifs capable of binding SH3 domains (Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001Richnau N. Aspenstrom P. Rich, a rho GTPase-activating protein domain-containing protein involved in signaling by Cdc42 and Rac1.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35060-35070Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (see below; see also Figure S6A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). To identify endogenous proteins that associate with Rich1 in epithelial cells, we constructed three clonal cell lines in which Rich1, containing an N-terminal triple-Flag epitope (Flag-Rich1), was stably expressed at low, medium, and high levels (data not shown). Lysates from these three lines were combined and then immunoprecipitated to capture Rich1 and associated proteins, which were identified through peptide sequencing by MS/MS (Figure 1D). This analysis showed that Rich1 associates with polarity proteins. The most abundant Rich1-associated protein migrated at 85 kDa and yielded 31 peptides matching 46% of the sequence for Amot. This isoform of Amot has an N-terminal coiled-coil structure and a predicted C-terminal PDZ-domain binding motif. In addition, the polarity protein Pals1 and its binding partner Patj were identified (Figure 1D and Table S1). These interactions appear specific, as we did not see these proteins associate with other RhoGAPs such as chimerin (Table S1). Because Pals1 and Patj are interconnected with the Par-3/Par-6/aPKC complex, we tested whether these latter proteins also coprecipitate with Flag-Rich1. Immunoblotting revealed aPKC and the 100 kDa isoform of Par-3, but not Par-6, in Rich1 immunoprecipitates (Figure 1E). Par-3 and aPKC likely associate with Rich1 at lower levels than Pals1 and Patj since they were not identified by MS. We also found endocytic proteins associated with Rich1. These included the adaptors CIN85 and CD2AP, which directly bind each other and target the EGF (Soubeyran et al., 2002Soubeyran P. Kowanetz K. Szymkiewicz I. Langdon W.Y. Dikic I. Cbl-CIN85-endophilin complex mediates ligand-induced downregulation of EGF receptors.Nature. 2002; 416: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and HGF (Petrelli et al., 2002Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. The endophilin-CIN85-Cbl complex mediates ligand-dependent downregulation of c-Met.Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) receptors for endocytosis, as well as the actin capping proteins CAPZα and CAPZβ, known binding partners of CD2AP (Hutchings et al., 2003Hutchings N.J. Clarkson N. Chalkley R. Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Linking the T cell surface protein CD2 to the actin-capping protein CAPZ via CMS and CIN85.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22396-22403Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D and Table S1). Since Rich1 interacts with polarity proteins that associate with TJs, we examined Rich1 localization in polarized MDCK cells using an antibody raised against Rich1. This revealed that endogenous Rich1 associates with membranes (Figure S1A) and concentrates at sites of cell-cell contact, as well as showing a diffuse intracellular punctate stain (Figure 2A, top panel). The antibody is specific since Rich1 immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were reduced in Rich1-silenced MDCK cells (Figures S2A and S2B). Analysis of endogenous Rich1 staining along the apical-basolateral axis of wt MDCK cells revealed a concentration of Rich1 that overlapped with the basal parts of ZO-1 and with E-cadherin and β-Catenin (Figures 2A and 2B and Figures S1B and S1C). Thus, Rich1 codistributes with markers for both the TJ and AJ. Since Rich1 is a Cdc42 GAP that localizes to the TJ and AJ, we addressed the effects of reducing or increasing its expression on TJ integrity in MDCK cells. Clonal cell lines stably expressing wt Flag-Rich1, or a mutant of Rich1 lacking the N-terminal 240 amino acids comprising the BAR domain (ΔBAR), displayed a morphology indistinguishable from the parental MDCK cells (data not shown). However, MDCK cells stably expressing a GAP-deficient mutant of Rich1 (R288A) grew slowly and had a de-epithelialized morphology, interspersed with patches of cells with identifiable TJs, as revealed by ZO-1 staining (Figure 2C). To quantitatively assess the integrity of TJs, we measured the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of wt MDCK cells, MDCK cells stably overexpressing wt Flag-Rich1, Flag-Rich1 ΔBAR (data not shown), or Flag-Rich1 (R288A). All had TER in excess of 300 ohms × cm2 2 days after plating (Figure 2D), except monolayers of cells expressing the R288A GAP-deficient mutant, which had no appreciable resistance even after culturing for 5 days (Figure 2D). The slower growth rate of the MDCK R288A cells does not account for their inability to form TER since they still failed to develop any resistance when plated at a higher density (data not shown). To assess the specificity of the defects on TJs induced by Rich1 R288A, we also constructed stable MDCK lines that expressed a distinct Cdc42-specific RhoGAP, chimerin, or a mutant of chimerin (R304A) predicted to lack GAP activity. Both of these lines developed TER similar to wt MDCK cells (data not shown), and their TJs appeared normal by ZO-1 localization (Figure S2G). To directly assess the involvement of Rich1 in TJ development and maintenance, we isolated two clonal MDCK cell lines (2A-6 and 2A-7) that stably express short hairpin (sh) RNAi to Rich1 and have a reduction in Rich1 expression of at least 60% and 90%, respectively (Figure 2E inset box; Figure S2A). Significantly, the 2A-7 line failed to form monolayers with any measurable TER (Figure 2E). The loss of TJ integrity correlated with the degree of Rich1 silencing since the 2A-6 line formed monolayers that developed TER, albeit more slowly than wt MDCK cells (Figure 2E). Since the defects in TJ structures in Rich1-deficient MDCK cells could reflect alterations in the formation, stability, and/or turnover of TJs, we examined the effects of calcium removal in monolayers of 2A-6 cells. The TER of 2A-6 MDCK cells declined more rapidly than for wt cells following chelation of calcium (Figure 2F), suggesting that Rich1 is important for maintaining the stability of TJs. To gauge whether the defects observed in MDCK 2A-7 cells silenced for Rich1 correlated with improper localization of TJ proteins, these cells were fixed and stained 48 hr after plating with antibodies to the TJ proteins ZO-1, Par-3, and Pals1 and the AJ protein E-cadherin. All the TJ markers were mislocalized in 2A-7 cells. En face images showed ZO-1, Par-3, and Pals1 at fragmented spots and in circular structures in the 2A-7 (Figure 2G; Figures S2C and S2D) and R288A (data not shown) cell lines as opposed to their localization at cell-cell contacts in wt MDCK cells. Further analysis of ZO-1 staining along the apical-basolateral axis revealed that these circular structures extended into the basal regions of the cell (Figure S2F). Consistent with Rich1's functioning in the maintenance of TJs, we found that Par-3 was partially localized to cell-cell contacts in the MDCK 2A-7 cell line 12 hr after plating but was increasingly mislocalized by 24 and 36 hr (Figure S2H). Furthermore, the overall morphology of these cells became somewhat fibroblastic at these later times (Figure S2I). In contrast, E-cadherin localized normally in both the R288A (data not shown) and 2A-7 cell lines (Figure 2H), indicating a selective loss of TJs. Since overexpressing the R288A mutant of Rich1 gave a phenotype similar to silencing Rich1 expression, we surmise that this construct behaves in a dominant-negative manner and that proper regulation of Cdc42 or closely related GTPases by Rich1 is important for TJ integrity. To pursue how Rich1 is integrated into the network of TJ proteins, we used MS/MS to identify further binding partners for Rich1-associated proteins, including Amot and Par-3. To this end, we stably expressed human Amot (KIAA1071) (with an N-terminal triple Flag epitope) in 293T cells, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibodies. Endogenous Par-3 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from rat brain lysates. Immunoprecipitates of Amot (Figure 3A; Table S1) contained peptides for Rich1, Pals1, and Patj, providing additional evidence that these four proteins interact in a single complex. Amot also coprecipitated with several proteins that were not detected in Rich1 complexes, including a MAGUK protein (membrane protein, palmitoylated 7; MPP7), the multiple PDZ-domain protein (MUPP1), Amot-like 1 (AMOTL1, also termed junctionally enriched protein, or JEAP)(Nishimura et al., 2002Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Ono Y. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Inoue Y. Imai T. Takai Y. JEAP, a novel component of tight junctions in exocrine cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5583-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and Amot-like 2 (AMOTL2, also termed MASCOT) (Patrie, 2005Patrie K.M. Identification and characterization of a novel tight junction-associated family of proteins that interacts with a WW domain of MAGI-1.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A; Table S1). These data suggest that Amot is a component of at least two complexes, only one of which contains Rich1. To verify association of endogenous Rich1, Amot, and Par-3, we examined immunoprecipitations from lysates prepared from tissue culture or rat brains by immunoblot or MS analysis. Endogenous Rich1 coprecipitated with Amot from both 293T (Figure 3B) and rat brain (data not shown) lysates. Furthermore, Amot was detected in an immunoprecipitation of Par-3 from rat brain lysate (Figure 3B), and analysis of a Par-3 immunoprecipitate from rat brain lysates by MS/MS detected two peptides matching sequences in Rich1, confirming that Rich1, Amot, and Par-3 associate in vivo (Table S1). These data indicate that Rich1, Amot, Pals1, Patj, and Par-3 form a specific complex in epithelial cells but can also contribute to other complexes with distinct components (Figure 3C). Sequence analysis has predicted two Amot isoforms that differ in the extent of their N termini (Moreau et al., 2005Moreau J. Lord M. Boucher M. Belleau P. Fernandes M.J. Protein diversity is generated within the motin family of proteins by alternative pre-mRNA splicing.Gene. 2005; 350: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to angiomotin detected two bands of ∼130 kDa and 85 kDa in 293T cells (Figure 4A) and rodent brain (data not shown), consistent with the expression of both Amot isoforms. In MDCK cells, however, the 85 kDa isoform was more abundant (Figure 4A). Amot has a potential PDZ binding motif (EYLI) at its C terminus (Figure S6A), which might recruit proteins such as Pals1 and Patj. Indeed, YFP-Amot separately precipitated Flag-Pals1 and Myc-Patj in 293T cells, whereas a mutant of Amot lacking the C-terminal 5 residues (ΔC-term) did not precipitate either protein (Figure 4B). While these data suggest that Amot interacts with the Pals1-Patj complex via its PDZ binding motif, they do not identify the primary binding partner for Amot because the L27 domains of Pals1 and Patj can heterodimerize (Roh et al., 2002Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. The Maguk protein, Pals1, functions as an adapter, linking mammalian homologues of Crumbs and Discs Lost.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Amot could bind mutants of Patj or Pals1 that lack L27 domains (Patj 3-10PDZ or Pals1 PDZ, respectively) and consequently do not associate with each other. Because Amot bound Patj 3-10PDZ (Figure 4C) but not Pals1 PDZ (Figure S5), it is likely that the C-terminal motif of Amot interacts with one of the eight C-terminal PDZ domains of Patj and that Patj recruits Pals1 to Amot. These results indicate that Amot might colocalize with the Pals1/Patj complex in polarized epithelial cells through its C terminus. We therefore examined the distribution of stably expressed YFP-Amot 85 kDa or YFP-Amot 85 kDa ΔC-term in MDCK cells. In addition to a diffuse distribution, YFP-Amot 85 kDa was enriched at regions of cell-cell contact where it colocalized with endogenous Par-3, ZO-1, and Pals1 (Figures 4D and 4F; Figure S4A); in contrast, YFP-Amot 85 kDa ΔC-term did not colocalize with Par-3 (Figure 4E), indicating that the Amot PDZ binding motif is necessary for its recruitment to TJs. Further, deconvoluted Z stack images showed YFP-Amot 85 kDa codistributed to apical surfaces of MDCK cells with endogenous Patj (Figure 4G). We therefore propose that the PDZ binding motif at the C terminus of Amot binds Patj and that this is necessary for Amot to localize to TJs. To determine the localization of endogenous Amot, we stained polarized MDCK cells with Amot antibody. Amot was seen at cell-cell contacts and partially colocalized with ZO-1 (Figure 5A), as has been recently reported in endothelial cells (Bratt et al., 2005Bratt A. Birot O. Sinha I. Veitonmaki N. Aase K. Ernkvist M. Holmgren L. Angiomotin regulates endothelial cell-cell junctions and cell motility.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34859-34869Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, Amot was seen in regions below the TJ, coincident with the AJ protein E-cadherin (Figure 5B). This extended basal staining of endogenous Amot, which is not seen with the exogenous 85 kDa isoform (Figure 4G; Figures S4G and S4H), may represent the 130 kDa Amot isoform, which contains an N-terminal extension that can bind the AJ protein Magi-1b (Bratt et al., 2005Bratt A. Birot O. Sinha I. Veitonmaki N. Aase K. Ernkvist M. Holmgren L. Angiomotin regulates endothelial cell-cell junctions and cell motility.J. Biol.

To determine whether Amot might function in the formation or maintenance of TJs, we imaged its localization in MDCK cells following an overnight Ca2+ switch. Unlike ZO-1, which was localized to the TJ within 2–4 hr, Amot did not completely regain TJ staining until 4 to 24 hr following the readdition of Ca2+. Since Amot relocalizes to the TJ later than ZO-1 or"

Histone demethylases, members of a newly emerging transcription-factor family, remove methyl groups from the lysine residues of the histone tails and thereby regulate the transcriptional activity of target genes. JmjC-domain-containing proteins have been predicted to be demethylases. For example, the JmjC-containing protein JMJD2A has been characterized as a H3-K9me3- and H3-K36me3-specific demethylase. Here, structures of the catalytic-core domain of JMJD2A with and without <b>α</b>-ketoglutarate in the presence of Fe<sup>2+</sup> have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The structure of the core domain, consisting of the JmjN domain, the JmjC domain, the C-terminal domain, and a zinc-finger motif, revealed the unique elements that form a potential substrate binding pocket. Sited-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with demethylase activity assays allowed us to propose a molecular model for substrate selection by the JMJD2 histone demethylase family."

During development, fat cell precursors (i.e., preadipocytes) undergo a hypertrophic response as they mature into lipid-laden adipocytes. However, the mechanisms that regulate adipocyte size and mass remain undefined. Herein, we demonstrate that the membrane-anchored metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP, coordinates adipocyte differentiation in vivo. In the absence of the protease, WAT development is aborted, leaving tissues populated by mini-adipocytes which render null mice lipodystrophic. While MT1-MMP preadipocytes display a cell autonomous defect in vivo, null progenitors retain the ability to differentiate into functional adipocytes during 2-dimensional (2-D) culture. By contrast, within the context of the 3-dimensional (3-D) ECM, normal adipocyte maturation requires a burst in MT1-MMP-mediated proteolysis that modulates pericellular collagen rigidity in a fashion that controls adipogenesis. Hence, MT1-MMP acts as a 3-D-specific adipogenic factor that directs the dynamic adipocyte-ECM interactions critical to WAT development.

Hence, MT1-MMP acts as a 3-D-specific adipogenic factor that directs the dynamic adipocyte-ECM interactions critical to WAT development. White adipose tissue (WAT) plays a key role in regulating energy homeostasis by not only functioning as the primary depot for energy stores but also by secreting key signaling molecules that impact on multiple target organ systems (Flier, 2004Flier J.S. Obesity wars: Molecular progress confronts an expanding epidemic.Cell. 2004; 116: 337-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). During development, mesenchymal stem cells that populate the primordial fat pad are induced to commit to the adipocyte lineage (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Molecular regulation of adipogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Within a 3-D organoid-like environment that is rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules, the adipocyte precursors (i.e., preadipocytes) undergo a sequential differentiation program to form lipid-laden adipocytes that respond to insulin signaling, synthesize and store triglyceride deposits, and express functionally important adipokines (Napolitano, 1963Napolitano L.

Insulin signaling and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). To orchestrate this cellular transformation, preadipocytes engage a network of multiple transcription factors that regulate both the adipogenic program as well as the final mix of gene products expressed in the mature adipocyte (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Molecular regulation of adipogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, the epigenetic regulators that control the expression of this transcription program in the in vivo setting remain largely uncharacterized. MT1-MMP is the prototypical member of a subgroup of membrane-tethered proteinases that belong to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family (Itoh and Seiki, 2006Itoh Y. Seiki M. MT1-MMP: A potent modifier of pericellular microenvironment.J. Cell. Phys. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Synthesized as a proenzyme, the MT1-MMP zymogen undergoes activation following intracellular processing and is displayed on the cell surface as an active proteinase that can degrade a wide variety of cell-associated, soluble, or ECM-derived targets (e.g., Hiraoka et al., 1998Hiraoka N.

MT1-MMP: A potent modifier of pericellular microenvironment.J. Cell. Phys. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of MT1-MMP-mediated hydrolytic events in vivo are largely undefined, but it is noteworthy that MT1-MMP null mice display a poorly characterized failure to thrive and a markedly shortened lifespan (Holmbeck et al., 1999Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R.

USA. 2000; 97: 4052-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP plays a required role in regulating WAT development and function. In the absence of MT1-MMP, the transcription factor cascades that underlie adipocyte maturation are disrupted with consequent effects on WAT function. Unexpectedly, we find that normal adipocyte maturation only proceeds when coordinated with the tandem MT1-MMP-dependent remodeling of the 3-D type I collagen scaffolding which dominates primordial white fat deposits. In the absence of MT1-MMP, preadipocytes are unable to mount a required collagenolytic response during WAT development and are entrapped within a dense meshwork of collagen fibrils that disrupt both cell cytoarchitecture and cell-signaling programs critical to adipogenesis. These findings serve to identify adipocyte MT1-MMP as a heretofore unsuspected, 3-D matrix-specific regulator of WAT development and function. Dermal tissues isolated from 14-day-old wild-type mice display a characteristic epidermal layer overlying a hair follicle- and adipocyte-rich hypodermis (Figure 1A) (Hausman et al., 2001Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. The biology of white adipocyte proliferation.Obes. Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). By contrast, while the MT1-MMP−/− epidermis and dermis exhibit normal overall structure, adipocytes are no longer visualized readily (Figure 1A). At higher magnification, however, MT1-MMP null adipocytes, with a cell diameter up to ten times smaller than that found in wild-type adipocytes, can be discerned in association with nearby hair follicles (Figure 1A, lower panels). While the architecture of WAT deposits varies from tissue to tissue (e.g., Hausman et al., 2001Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. The biology of white adipocyte proliferation.Obes. Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), similar, if not identical, effects on adipocyte size and WAT mass are observed in MT1-MMP−/− inguinal as well as epididymal fat pads (Figure 1B and data not shown). Further, whereas wild-type adipocytes are characterized by large lipid deposits as assessed by either Oil Red O staining or TEM (Figures 1B and 1C), the MT1-MMP−/− adipocytes stain poorly and contain only small unilocular or multilocular deposits of fat (Figures 1B and 1C). Though WAT expresses a range of other MMPs, including MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-3 (e.g., Chavey et al., 2003Chavey C. Mari B. Monthouel M.N. Bonnafous S. Anglard P. Van Obberghen E. Tartare-Deckert S. Matrix metalloproteinases are differentially expressed in adiose tissue during obesity and modulate adipocyte differentiation.J. Biol.

Enhanced nutritionally induced adipose tissue development in mice with stromelysin-I gene inactivation.Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), male mice null for each of these proteinases do not display significant defects in adipocyte size or mass (Figure 1D). Importantly, despite a failure to thrive, MT1-MMP−/− brown adipose tissue (BAT) appears normal relative to controls (Figure 1E; interscapular mass of MT1-MMP+/+ and MT1-MMP−/− BAT is 0.67 ± 0.5% and 0.61 ± 0.07% of the respective body weights). To define functional consequences of the MT1-MMP null status on WAT development, inguinal fat pads were isolated from 14-day-old wild-type and MT1-MMP−/− mice, and gene expression characterized. Despite the phenotypic differences between wild-type and MT1-MMP null WAT, more than 90% of the genes detected display no more than a 2-fold difference in expression (Figures 2A and 2B). Furthermore, expression levels for key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and sterol regulatory element binding protein I (SREBP-I), are largely unaffected as are levels for critical elements of the insulin signal transduction cascade (Figures 2C–2E and Table S1) (e.g., Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Molecular regulation of adipogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, Lazar, 2002Lazar M.A. Becoming fat.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). While MT1-MMP has been reported to control the regulation of VEGF-A expression (Itoh and Seiki, 2006Itoh Y. Seiki M. MT1-MMP: A potent modifier of pericellular microenvironment.J. Cell. Phys. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), a central factor in regulating WAT angiogenesis, MT1-MMP−/− tissues express normal levels of the transcript (Table S1). However, mRNA levels for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family members, including C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, are depressed in tandem with the C/EBP-regulated target genes, leptin, aquaporin 7, steroyl CoA desaturase, PEPCK, and UCP-1 (Figures 2C–2E) (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2000Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Molecular regulation of adipogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, Lazar, 2002Lazar M.A. Becoming fat.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Further, gene sets linked to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as to mitochondrial function are inhibited strongly (Figure 2D and Table S1). Together, these data suggest that MT1-MMP deficiency exerts global effects on adipocyte structure and function by selectively controlling the expression of a significant subset of gene products critical to the adipogenic process. Consistent with a gene expression profile that predicts selective effects on WAT function, insulin administered intraperitoneally to 14-day-old mice elicits a comparable increase in Akt phosphorylation in both wild-type and null tissues in vivo (Figure S1) (Saltiel and Kahn, 2001Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Insulin signaling and the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). However, downstream targets of the insulin signaling cascade are affected as MT1-MMP−/− adipocytes are unable to mount a normal lipogenic response (Figure 2E). Further, whereas adiponectin levels are within normal range, circulating leptin is undetectable in MT1-MMP−/− mice (Figure 2F). Functional defects in WAT deposits are also reflected in the induction of a lipodystrophic-like state in MT1-MMP−/− mice, as evidenced by increases in both hepatic triglyceride and glycogen contents (Figure S1). Thus, MT1-MMP not only regulates adipocyte morphology but also exerts control over a complex set of gene products that impact on lipid metabolism in vivo. MT1-MMP is able to hydrolyze a wide variety of cell-associated targets ranging from integrins to growth factors (e.g., Lehti et al., 2005Lehti K. Allen E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Holmbeck K. Miyake Y. Chun T.H. Weiss S.J. An MT1-MMP-PDGF receptor-β axis regulates mural cell investment of the microvasculature.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 979-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, Itoh and Seiki, 2006Itoh Y. Seiki M. MT1-MMP: A potent modifier of pericellular microenvironment.J. Cell. Phys. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To first determine whether MT1-MMP regulates adipogenesis via the hydrolysis of an adipocyte-derived target molecule, the differentiation of wild-type and MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes to lipid-laden adipocytes was assessed in vitro. At postnatal day 3–5, WAT is not yet developed fully and primordial fat pads are populated largely by preadipocytes and their precursors (Hausman et al., 2001Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. The biology of white adipocyte proliferation.Obes. Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Within this time frame, the inguinal fat pads of MT1-MMP+/+ and MT1-MMP−/− mice are morphologically indistinguishable with no changes in proliferation rates, apoptosis, or vascular density (Figures 3A and S2). Likewise, preadipocytes isolated from 3–5-day-old wild-type or null tissues and cultured in the absence of growth factors display similar morphologies (Figure 3B). In response to a mixture of proadipogenic factors (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Role of CREB in transcriptional regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β gene during adipogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), wild-type preadipocytes differentiate and adopt a spherical shape, incorporate lipid, and express adipocyte markers (Figure 3B). Surprisingly, MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes likewise engage a normal adipogenic program to form mature adipocytes indistinguishable from controls (Figure 3B). Adipose tissue comprises a complex mixture of adipocytes, endothelial cells, leukocytes, and nerve cells (Napolitano, 1963Napolitano L. The differentiation of white adipose cells. An electron microscope study.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, Hausman et al., 2001Hausman D.B. DiGirolamo M. Bartness T.J. Hausman G.J. Martin R.J. The biology of white adipocyte proliferation.Obes. Rev. 2001; 2: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). As MT1-MMP is expressed widely in host tissues (Itoh and Seiki, 2006Itoh Y. Seiki M. MT1-MMP: A potent modifier of pericellular microenvironment.J. Cell. Phys. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), in vivo defects in WAT development might potentially be assigned to the nonadipocyte compartment. Hence, taking advantage of the fact that preadipocytes can be induced to differentiate into mature adipocytes following in vivo transplantation (Mandrup et al., 1997Mandrup S. Loftus T.M. MacDougald O.A. Kuhajda F.P. Lane M.D. Obese gene expression at in vivo levels by fat pads derived from s.c. implanted 3T3–F442A preadipocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 4300-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), wild-type or MT1-MMP−/− stromal cells were transduced with a GFP expression vector and injected subcutaneously into the inguinal region of wild-type recipient mice. After a 14-day incubation period, GFP-positive tissues recovered from mice inoculated with wild-type preadipocytes reveal the ectopic formation of well-developed adipocytes (Figure 3C). As expected, the lipid-laden cells are positive for both GFP and the lipophilic dye, Nile Red (Figure 3C). In marked contrast, only limited deposits of fat localize to ectopic MT1-MMP null adipocytes (Figure 3C). Thus, while MT1-MMP−/− adipocyte precursors can differentiate in vitro, a cell-autonomous defect is displayed in the in vivo setting. The failure to recapitulate the MT1-MMP null phenotype in vitro is consistent with the possibility that WAT development introduces an MT1-MMP target substrate that is unique to the in vivo environment. To this end, inguinal fat pad morphology was assessed by TEM. Indeed, while the ECM of normal WAT is known to be dominated by fibrillar type I collagen (Napolitano, 1963Napolitano L. The differentiation of white adipose cells. An electron microscope study.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the density of collagen fibrils in MT1-MMP−/− WAT is increased markedly (Figure 4A), with collagen levels elevated more than ten-fold (Figure 4B). Interestingly, neither the collagen content of BAT nor tail tendon collagen content is affected by the MT1-MMP null status of the mice (Figure 4B). As MT1-MMP expresses pericellular collagenolytic activity (Chun et al., 2004Chun T.H. Sabeh F. Ota I. Murphy H. McDonagh K. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Allen E.D. Weiss S.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and type I collagen mRNA levels (as well as those of the other mouse MMP family members) are unaffected in MT1-MMP−/− WAT (Table S2), we considered the possibility that MT1-MMP-type I collagen interactions control preadipocyte differentiation. Hence, wild-type or MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes were cultured atop a bed of fibrillar type I collagen, and maturation was induced with adipogenic factors (Figure 4C). However, despite the presence of a type I collagen substratum, the MT1-MMP null cells retain the ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes (Figure 4C). Though the compliance or “stiffness” of the underlying substratum can regulate differentiation programs in a variety of cell types (Discher et al., 2005Discher D.E. Janmey P. Wang Y.L.

In contrast with the cell-matrix interactions that occur at planar, 2-D interfaces, cell behavior is altered dramatically when cells are embedded within a 3-D matrix (Cukierman et al., 2002Cukierman E.

Indeed, early studies of in vivo adipocyte development highlighted the fact that preadipocytes differentiate within—rather than atop—a 3-D matrix of type I collagen fibrils (Napolitano, 1963Napolitano L. The differentiation of white adipose cells. An electron microscope study.J. Cell Biol. 1963; 18: 663-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine whether the modulatory effects of MT1-MMP on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on the 3-D architecture of the surrounding matrix, preadipocyte maturation was examined alternatively with cells dispersed and embedded within a fibrillar gel of type I collagen. As shown in Figure 5A, prior to the addition of the adipogenic cocktail, MT1-MMP+/+ preadipocytes cultured within a 3-D collagen matrix display a stellate morphology and organize an actin network marked by stress fibers. In contrast, the MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes assume an abnormal, spiculated morphology wherein stress fibers are not discerned readily (Figure 5A). Of note, the altered morphology of the MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes is not observed when cells are cultured atop identically constructed collagen gels (Figure 5A; insets). Cell shape and cytoskeletal architecture together conspire to regulate cellular responses to a range of exogenous stimuli (e.g., Chen et al., 1997Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Geometric control of cell life and death.Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3984) Google Scholar, McBeath et al., 2004McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K.

As cells receive mechanical inputs from the surrounding matrix, downstream signaling pathways are activated that regulate cell geometry and the generation of RhoA-dependent tractional forces (McBeath et al., 2004McBeath R.

Tissue cells feel and respond to the stiffness of their substrate.Science. 2005; 310: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (4407) Google Scholar). Whereas 3-D-embedded MT1-MMP+/+ preadipocytes exert sufficient traction to rapidly contract released collagen gels, MT1-MMP null cells are completely unable to remodel the matrix despite comparable levels of active RhoA (Figure 5A). Defects in traction could conceivably alter lineage commitment of preadipocyte precursor cells (McBeath et al., 2004McBeath R. Pirone D.M. Nelson C.M. Bhadriraju K. Chen C.S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), phenocopy the abnormal morphology and traction responses exhibited by MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes (Figure 5A). As predicted on the basis of their comparable shape and normal adipogenic potential under 2-D conditions, MT1-MMP+/+ preadipocytes (cultured in the absence or presence of TIMP-2) as well as their MT1-MMP−/− counterparts remodel collagen gels to equivalent degrees when cultured atop the 3-D matrices (Figure 5A). The abnormal set-point established by 3-D-embedded MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes wherein cell shape and tension are perturbed raises the possibility that early responses to adipogenic growth factors may be altered. CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) serves as a key transcriptional activator during adipocyte differentiation and undergoes rapid phosphorylation in response to stimulation with adipogenic hormones (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang J.W. Klemm D.J. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Role of CREB in transcriptional regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β gene during adipogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4471-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In 3-D gels, CREB is found in a constitutively phosphorylated state in both MT1-MMP+/+ and MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes, but the levels of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) and total CREB are dramatically reduced in the null cells (Figure 5B). Consistent with an upstream defect in transcriptional regulation, microarray analyses of MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes cultured with adipogenic factors under 3-D, but not 2-D, conditions in vitro largely recapitulate the in vivo profile of disturbed gene expression detailed in MT1-MMP null WAT (Figure 5C). To assess the morphologic impact of MT1-MMP-deficiency on adipocyte development under 3-D culture conditions in vitro, cells isolated from wild-type and null littermates were embedded in type I collagen gels and adipocyte maturation monitored over a 6-day incubation period. Over this time course, wild-type preadipocytes express MT1-MMP and acquire the spherical shape characteristic of aP2-positive adipocytes (Figure 6A). While proliferation rates of 3-D embedded MT1-MMP+/+ and MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes are comparable under these conditions (i.e., at day 6, cell number increased from 2.0 × 105 to 7.4 ± 1.2 × 105 and 8.9 ± 1.1 × 105, respectively, for wild-type and null cells), MT1-MMP−/− adipocytes adopt a shrunken morphology similar to that observed in vivo and fail to accumulate lipid deposits comparably to wild-type cells (Figures 6B and S3). The abnormal morphology and differentiation of MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes cultured in 3-D collagen supports a model wherein wild-type preadipocytes mobilize MT1-MMP to degrade surrounding collagen in a fashion that coordinately alters matrix compliancy and cell shape. Indeed, while the hypertrophic growth of MT1-MMP+/+ adipocytes coincides with the accumulation of pericellular type I collagen degradation products (Figure 6B, upper middle panel), matrix remodeling is absent in MT1-MMP−/− cells (Figure 6B, lower middle panel). Together, these findings suggest that MT1-MMP-dependent collagenolysis plays a required role in regulating pericellular matrix rigidity. Indeed, the 3-D differentiation of wild-type preadipocytes is suppressed markedly as collagen density, and hence rigidity is increased (Figures 6B and S4). Conversely, the phenotype of MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes is normalized partially when the type I collagen concentration is reduced 3-fold to 0.8 mg/ml (Figure 6B). Similarly, at 0.8 mg/ml collagen, leptin secretion increases from undetectable levels to approximately 40% of those found in 3-D cultures of MT1-MMP+/+ adipocytes (i.e., 76 pg/ml versus ∼200 pg/ml for wild-type cells cultured in 2.4 μg/ml collagen) (Figure 6C). A required role for MT1-MMP during adipocyte differentiation is restricted to 3-D type I collagen as culturing MT1-MMP−/− preadipocytes within a rigid, 3-D gel of cross-linked fibrin (a fibrillar ECM component that is degraded readily by either adipocyte MT1-MMP or MT3-MMP) (Hotary et al., 2002Hotary K.B.

Here, we report an unexpected strategy for beta-catenin-dependent regulation of cell-lineage determination based on interactions between beta-catenin and a specific homeodomain factor, Prop1, rather than Lef/Tcfs. beta-catenin acts as a binary switch to simultaneously activate expression of the critical lineage-determining transcription factor, Pit1, and to repress the gene encoding the lineage-inhibiting transcription factor, Hesx1, acting via TLE/Reptin/HDAC1 corepressor complexes. The strategy of functionally distinct actions of a homeodomain factor in response to Wnt signaling is suggested to be prototypic of a widely used mechanism for generating diverse cell types from pluripotent precursor cells in response to common signaling pathways during organogenesis."

The specific connectivity of axons and dendrites is the functional foundation of the nervous system and can be thought of as emerging in distinct steps: outgrowth and guidance of neuronal processes to a target field, choice of the appropriate target from within the local environment, and finally the assembly of synapses at distinct subcellular compartments (reviewed in Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996Tessier-Lavigne M.

The mechanisms underlying target recognition and specific synapse formation are not well understood. In particular, molecular interactions that regulate contact with multiple targets and control the restrictions of synaptic contacts to layers or laminae as well as subcellular compartments are largely unknown (Yamagata et al., 2002Yamagata M.

Roger Sperry proposed in the chemo-affinity hypothesis that an axon will link up to a postsynaptic target by selective attachment mediated by specific chemical affinities (Sperry, 1963Sperry R.W. Chemoaffinity in the Orderly Growth of Nerve Fiber Patterns and Connections.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1963; 50: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar). He pointed out that the high degree of specificity implicit in this hypothesis required invoking either an enormous number of different molecular labels (chemical affinities) or the ability of an integrative graded response to different concentrations of a small number of signals. The work of many groups has established that complementary gradients of Eph receptors and their ligands are an important example of the latter possibility (Cheng et al., 1995Cheng H.J. Nakamoto M.

Although gradients of diffusible signals and their complementary receptors provide mechanisms for the guidance of axons during topographic map formation, many questions remain regarding other guidance mechanisms, local target selection, and synapse specification. In the olfactory system, it has been proposed that the molecular diversity provided by the large gene family (∼1000) of olfactory receptors (OR) plays an instructive role in connection specificity (Wang et al., 1998Wang F.

Each one of the millions of olfactory neurons expresses only a single OR, and axons expressing the same receptor coalesce and form connections with single glomeruli. Receptor-swap experiments have shown that changing only a small number of amino acids in an OR is sufficient to respecify the target selection of the olfactory neurons expressing these modified ORs (Feinstein and Mombaerts, 2004Feinstein P. Mombaerts P. A contextual model for axonal sorting into glomeruli in the mouse olfactory system.Cell. 2004; 117: 817-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). ORs are expressed only in olfactory neurons, and it remains unclear whether different diverse receptors will show a similar ability in regulating targeting specificity in other regions of the central nervous system. Other gene families of neural receptors capable of generating a large molecular diversity have been identified. These include neurexins (Missler et al., 1998Missler M. Hammer R.E. Sudhof T.C.

In addition, a substantial number of diverse immune receptors are expressed in the mammalian brain (reviewed in Boulanger and Shatz, 2004Boulanger L.M. Shatz C.J. Immune signalling in neural development, synaptic plasticity and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and for the MHC-class of receptors it has been shown that they are functionally required for synaptic specificity (Huh et al., 2000Huh G.S. Boulanger L.M. Du H. Riquelme P.A. Brotz T.M. Shatz C.J. Functional requirement for class I MHC in CNS development and plasticity.Science. 2000; 290: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The Drosophila gene Dscam has been proposed to function as an important regulator of synaptic specificity because of its extraordinary molecular diversity. Drosophila Dscam can potentially generate 38,016 different mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This unprecedented number of unique receptor isoforms could be used to distinguish both cell and even synapse identities through selective expression and localization. Dscam protein is required throughout the developing nervous system for many aspects of axon guidance, targeting, axon branch specification, and dendrite patterning (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D.

PCR-based expression studies have suggested that the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors and may be utilized to generate unique cell identities in the nervous system (Neves et al., 2004Neves G. Zucker J. Daly M. Chess A. Stochastic yet biased expression of multiple Dscam splice variants by individual cells.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro binding studies have shown that Dscam isoforms can interact in a highly selective homophilic manner where even closely related isoforms show little interaction and exhibit almost exclusive isoform-specific binding (Wojtowicz et al., 2004Wojtowicz W.M. Flanagan J.J. Millard S.S. Zipursky S.L. Clemens J.C. Alternative splicing of Drosophila Dscam generates axon guidance receptors that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding.Cell. 2004; 118: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, genetic analysis of Dscam has not provided conclusive evidence for the requirement of Dscam diversity in specifying neuronal connectivity. Previous experiments have shown that single Dscam isoforms could rescue defects in Dscam null mushroom body neurons during neuronal differentiation or axon bifurcation. Different isoforms rescued the phenotypic defects equally well, questioning the need for the molecular diversity of Dscam in this system (Wang et al., 2004Wang J. Ma X. Yang J.S. Zheng X.

Here we present a systematic analysis of Dscam function in the precise targeting of axon branches within the somatosensory system of flies. First, our study identifies an essential function of Dscam for branching and targeting of mechanosensory neurons. Second, we find that expression of different single Dscam isoforms in Dscam null neurons rescues primary axonal branch extension and rudimentary branching but does not rescue the specific targeting of axonal branches. Third, Dscam mutant flies expressing only a reduced subset of 22,176 possible isoforms show specific axon targeting errors or deviations in nearly all of the mutant flies. Fourth, comparisons of axonal targeting errors between mutant flies revealed distinguishable phenotypes in flies that lack different subsets of isoforms. This supports the hypothesis that the molecular diversity of Dscam receptors is required for establishing the precise connections of a Drosophila sensory circuit and raises the possibility that local isoform-specific interactions instruct axonal branches to connect with their proper targets. To determine the role of specific isoforms in axonal targeting, an experimental system was chosen in which “general” versus isoform-specific Dscam functions could be distinguished. To this end we characterized the normal axonal targeting of adult mechanosensory neurons (ms-neurons) within the Drosophila somatosensory system. We focused on ms-neurons that innervate large bristles, or macrochaetae, of the posterior thorax, which sense airflow and touch (Figure 1). The axonal targeting of these ms-neurons is remarkably precise where much of the synaptic connectivity is invariant, and afferent projections of each ms-neuron are recognizable by their stereotyped axonal branching pattern within the Central Nervous System (CNS) (Ghysen, 1978Ghysen A. Sensory neurones recognise defined pathways in Drosophila central nervous system.Nature. 1978; 274: 864-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, Canal et al., 1998Canal I. Acebes A. Ferrus A.

Shepherd D. Persistent larval sensory neurones are required for the normal development of the adult sensory afferent projections in Drosophila.Development. 2002; 129: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar). Thirteen symmetrical pairs of macrochaetae and their associated ms-neurons are situated on opposite sides of the posterior thorax in stereotyped positions. Thus, the same ms-neuron can be identified in different animals by its specific corresponding bristle (Figures 1A and 1B). Ms-neurons situated at different body positions exhibit characteristic branching patterns. Therefore, the axonal branching pattern of ms-neurons can be used as a morphological readout for neuron-specific differences in connectivity (Canal et al., 1998Canal I. Acebes A. Ferrus A. Single neuron mosaics of the Drosophila gigas mutant project beyond normal targets and modify behavior.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 999-1008PubMed Google Scholar). To trace the axonal projections of single ms-neurons, two experimental methods were combined. The MARCM system (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L. Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker for studies of gene function in neuronal morphogenesis.Neuron. 1999; 22: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) was used to generate mosaic animals that express GFP in a small number of ms-neurons (Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures). Heatshock-mediated induction of Flp-recombinase resulted in stochastically occurring mosaic clones as indicated by GFP expression in ms-neurons (Figure 1B). To achieve exclusive single axon resolution and equal staining throughout axonal branches, we used anterograde labeling with lipophilic fluorescent dyes such as DiI and DiD (Experimental Procedures). Ms-neurons labeled by GFP, lipophilic dye, or both were selected, and axonal projections and arborizations within the thoracic ganglia were imaged. We examined the posterior Dorsocentral, (pDc), anterior Scutellar (aSc), and posterior Scutellar (pSc) neurons. In order to determine the invariant and variable aspects of the axonal branching pattern in wild-type animals, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the pSc projections (Figure 1D). The lengths and positions of the primary and secondary axonal branches in 41 wild-type flies were measured (Experimental Procedures). Eleven axonal branches were detectable at 99.5% frequency and were therefore designated as a prototypic pSc branching pattern. A single branch at a mesothoracic position occurred at low frequency (12%) and was therefore designated as an ectopic branch (Figure 1D). A large variance in the length of an axonal branch was found for the contralateral, descending secondary branch (Figure 1D). All other branches showed significantly less variation in axon length and relative position. We next analyzed the axonal projections of Dscam mutant neurons. Mosaic animals were generated in which a small subset of ms-neurons were homozygous for strong loss of function alleles of Dscam (Dscam20, Dscam21, or Dscam33) (Experimental Procedures). Nearly all Dscam mutant axons reached the CNS and entered the thoracic ganglion correctly, between the pro- and mesothoracic neuromeres (Figure 2). Within the CNS, however, all of the Dscam null ms-axons failed to elaborate any branches that connect to different targets (Figures 2B, 2C, and 2E–2J). The absence of Dscam within ms-axons does not appear to simply inhibit axonal branch formation (Figure 2I), as distinct axonal branches are still recognizable but remain tightly clustered in a small (<20 μm) bolus around a presumptive decision point. These phenotypic abnormalities suggest that nascent axonal branches fail to project away from the main axon shaft and are unable to extend in the appropriate directions. The characteristic targeting failure occurred at 100% penetrance in all Dscam null ms-neurons tested (n = 112), regardless of the type of ms-neuron (pDc, aSc, or pSc) analyzed (Figure 2J). It is likely that Dscam is required in the sensory neuron as well as in the CNS target area, and defects in the CNS could also have contributed to the observed targeting defects. To address this possibility, an analysis was carried out directly comparing the projections of Dscam heterozygous and homozygous null ms-axons encountering the same mosaic CNS target area (Supplemental Data and Figure S1). These experiments also provided support for an important cell-autonomous function of Dscam within ms-neurons. We conclude that Dscam expression within ms-neurons is essential for the establishment of the connectivity of axonal branches but dispensable for axon guidance from the periphery into the CNS. We next investigated whether different Dscam isoforms fulfill distinguishable functions during axonal targeting. Transgenic flies were generated bearing UAS-Dscam constructs of three isoforms obtained from mRNAs expressed in the developing nervous system (A = 1.30.30.2; B = 1.34.30.2; C = 7.6.19.2) (Experimental Procedures). Specific expression of Dscam isoforms within aSc or pSc neurons is presently unknown, and it is unclear whether they endogenously express isoforms A, B, or C. Nevertheless, all three isoforms contain the transmembrane segment encoded by exon 17.2, which has been reported to be important for localization to axons and is essential for rescue of axonal phenotypes in the adult mushroom body (Wang et al., 2004Wang J. Ma X. Yang J.S. Zheng X. Zugates C.T. Lee C.H. Lee T.

Clemens J.C. Neves G. Hattori D. Flanagan J.J. Hummel T. Vasconcelos M.L. Chess A. Zipursky S.L. Analysis of Dscam diversity in regulating axon guidance in Drosophila mushroom bodies.Neuron. 2004; 43: 673-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two independent transgene insertions of isoforms B and C and one of isoform A were tested for rescue of ms-neurons. Clones of Dscam null mutant cells were generated by MARCM, where selective loss of the GAL80 repressor allows for the GAL4-driven expression of both UAS-Dscam and UAS-mCD8-GFP under the control of the pan-neuronal promoter elav (Experimental Procedures). The axonal projections of 32 single ms-neurons, which included pDc, aSc, and pSc neurons, were analyzed (Figure 3). Single isoform expression in ms-neurons could only partially rescue Dscam loss-of-function phenotypes. Ms-neurons that lacked all Dscam protein characteristically could not grow secondary or tertiary branches, and a thin, short extension was occasionally observed (Figures 2C and 3B). In contrast, ms-neurons that expressed a single Dscam isoform showed a substantial rescue of the axon extension into the posterior compartments of the CNS (Figures 3C–3E and 3I–3K). However, specific axon extension in the anterior direction and especially to the contralateral side was mostly absent in neurons expressing only a single isoform. Only a single sample revealed the presence of a branch extending across the midline within the mesothoracic segment, where it stopped without forming any tertiary branches (Figure 3K). We analyzed the ms-neuron phenotypes of aSc and pSc neurons, which have a highly similar branching pattern in wild-type flies, and found that expression of isoform A was able to rescue the anterior branch extension in three out of four animals but could not rescue the contralateral projection (Figure 3C and 3I). In contrast, expression of isoform C entirely failed to rescue the anterior branch extension (0/6). In order to address whether an increase in Dscam expression would improve the rescue of ms-neurons, experiments were performed in which the transgene copy number had been doubled. However, no improvements of rescue in neurons expressing two copies of isoform B or C compared to single-copy rescues were detected (Figures 3F, 3L, and 3R). A significant increase in Dscam activity was verified using a dominant gain of function assay (Figure S2). Therefore, the lack of rescue of anterior or contralateral branches is not likely due to low Dscam protein expression. Taken together, these experiments suggest that a “core” activity of Dscam is necessary to facilitate axon extension of ms-neurons within the CNS and that this activity can be rescued equally well by different isoforms. In contrast, specific aspects of targeting, such as position or number of branches and directed branch extension, may require specific isoforms or combinations of isoforms. The rescue experiments using cDNAs of single isoforms suggest that different isoforms might be utilized in vivo for distinct branching or targeting decisions. However, given the large number of Dscam isoforms and substantial technical difficulties, isoform rescue experiments do not provide a suitable approach for a systematic analysis of Dscam isoform specificity. We therefore sought to test the functional importance of isoform diversity by only moderately reducing the Dscam diversity while maintaining the specific expression control of the endogenous Dscam gene. Fly strains were generated that selectively lack alternative exon 4 sequences due to small genomic deletions. This was accomplished using imprecise P-element excision of the DscamP05518 allele, which carries a P-element located between exon 4.3 and 4.4 (Figure 4A and Experimental Procedures) (Schmucker et al., 2000Schmucker D. Clemens J.C. Shu H. Worby C.A. Xiao J. Muda M. Dixon J.E. Zipursky S.L. Drosophila Dscam is an axon guidance receptor exhibiting extraordinary molecular diversity.Cell. 2000; 101: 671-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Two revertant fly lines were created where sequences spanning five alternative exon 4 sequences were removed (DscamΔR265 and DscamΔR272). The DscamΔR265 revertant strain lacks alternative exon 4 sequences 4.2–4.6, and the DscamΔR272 strain has a different subset of five exon 4 sequences deleted, 4.4–4.8 (Figure 4A). Both strains have a 41.7% reduction in exon 4 diversity and hence limit the maximally expressed number of potential isoforms to 22,176. We also generated two “clean-excision” strains, designated R43 and R87, which represent a complete reversion of the DscamP05518 allele to wild-type, as confirmed by sequencing and phenotypic analysis (Experimental Procedures). DscamΔR265, DscamΔR272, R43, and R87 were generated from the same parental strain carrying the DscamP05518 allele and thus share an identical genetic background. We therefore used flies with R43/R43, R87/R87, and R43/87 genotypes as wild-type control strains. First, we examined whether deletion of genomic sequences in the exon 4 cluster could alter the overall Dscam protein expression. Semiquantitative Western blot analysis of Dscam protein showed no detectable difference in overall expression among the different fly strains (Figure 4B). The lack of any truncated forms of Dscam indicated that no exon skipping occurred in the revertant fly strains. Although it is difficult to detect small deviations of protein levels by western blot analysis, the potential changes in Dscam protein levels in DscamΔR265 or DscamΔR272 alleles are certainly significantly less than the expected 50% reduction in heterozygous DscamLOF/+ animals, which were used as controls in the phenotypic analysis described below. The deletion of genomic sequences within the exon 4 cluster may influence the regulation of alternative splicing in DscamΔR265 or DscamΔR272 alleles. Custom-made oligo-arrays (Watson et al., 2005Watson F.L. Püttmann-Holgado R. Thomas F. Lamar D.L. Hughes M. Kondo M. Rebel V.I. Schmucker D. Extensive diversity of Ig-superfamily proteins in the immune system of insects.Science. 2005; 309: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) were used to analyze the mRNA splice variant distribution in the larval CNS of different genotypes (Experimental Procedures). Comparative expression analysis of all of the 81 alternative exons 6 and 9 sequences revealed no significant differences between control and DscamΔR265 or DscamΔR272 flies (Experimental Procedures), consistent with studies showing independent and different splicing signals controlling alternative splicing of exon 4 and exon 6 clusters (Kreahling and Graveley, 2005Kreahling J.M.

In an effort to discover regulators of cardiac hypertrophy, we performed a eukaryotic expression screen for activators of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, a cardiac-specific marker of hypertrophic signaling. We discovered that a family of transcriptional coactivators, called CAMTAs, promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and activates the ANF gene, at least in part, by associating with the cardiac homeodomain protein Nkx2-5. The transcriptional activity of CAMTAs is governed by association with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs), which negatively regulate cardiac growth. Mice homozygous for a mutation in a CAMTA gene are defective in cardiac growth in response to pressure overload and neurohumoral signaling, whereas mice lacking HDAC5, a class II HDAC, are sensitized to the prohypertrophic actions of CAMTA. These findings reveal a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that modulates cardiac growth and gene expression by linking hypertrophic signals to the cardiac genome."
https://openalex.org/W2079171495,"Primary cilia are widely used for signal transduction during development and in homeostasis and are assembled and maintained by intraflagellar transport (IFT). Here, we have dissected the role of IFT in signaling within the flagella (structural and functional counterparts of cilia) of the biflagellated green alga Chlamydomonas. Using a conditional IFT mutant enables us to deplete the IFT machinery from intact, existing flagella. We identify a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (CrPKG) within flagella as the substrate of a protein tyrosine kinase activated by flagellar adhesion during fertilization. We demonstrate that flagellar adhesion stimulates association of CrPKG with a new flagellar compartment. Moreover, formation of the compartment requires IFT, and IFT particles themselves are part of the compartment. Our results lead to a model in which the IFT machinery is required not only for assembling cilia and flagella but also for organizing a signaling pathway within the organelles during cilium-generated signaling."

The voltage-gated ion channels and their structural relatives are a large superfamily of membrane proteins specialized for electrical signaling and ionic homeostasis (1Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Sci. STKE 2004,. 2004; : re15Google Scholar). Voltage-gated sodium channels are responsible for the increase in sodium permeability that initiates action potentials in electrically excitable cells (2Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. J.

However, the molecular mechanism of voltage sensing by sodium channels and the other members of the voltage-gated ion channel family is unknown. The initial “sliding helix” (9Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 953-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or “helical screw” (15Guy H.R. Seetharamulu P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 508: 508-512Crossref Scopus (424) Google Scholar) models for voltage sensing proposed that the S4 segments, which have positively charged amino acids at intervals of three residues, transport gating charges outward to activate sodium channels in response to depolarization by moving along a spiral pathway through the protein structure. This movement would preserve interactions with surrounding hydrophilic and negatively charged amino acid residues during gating and there by stabilize the gating charges in the intramembrane environment. Many structure-function studies have supported this general model (see “Discussion”). In contrast, x-ray crystallographic studies of a bacterial voltage-gated K+ channel in complex with detergent and a site-directed antibody yielded a structure in which the S3 and S4 segments lay along the position of the intracellular surface of the membrane, dissociated from the remainder of the protein (16Jiang Q.X. Wang D.N. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2004; 430: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

These results led to the concept that the voltage sensors function as loosely linked “paddles,” pivoting through the phospholipid surrounding the core of the ion channel as a semi-rigid body rather than moving gating charge outward through the protein structure. This paddle model makes strikingly different predictions for polypeptide toxins that modify gating by interaction with the voltage sensors. Whereas polypeptide toxins might be able to bind the extracellular end of the voltage sensors in the resting state in a sliding helix or helical screw gating model, the S4 segments would not be expected to be available for toxin binding in the resting state in the paddle model. Scorpion venoms contain two groups of polypeptides toxins that alter sodium channel gating. The α-scorpion toxins, as well as sea anemone toxins and some spider toxins, bind to neurotoxin receptor site 3 and slow or block inactivation (19Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Here we show that a β-scorpion toxin binds to its receptor site in a concentration-dependent manner in the resting state and subsequently traps the voltage sensor in its activated state via a voltage-dependent but concentration-independent mechanism. We identify individual amino acid residues in the toxin-receptor interaction site, develop a three-dimensional structural model of toxin binding, and map the effects of mutations in the IIS4 voltage sensor on gating and toxin action. Our results favor voltage-sensing models in which the S4 segment is in a transmembrane position in both the resting and activated states of the channel.

Measurements of β-Scorpion Toxin Binding in Transfected tsA-201 Cells—The tsA-201 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 μg/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Gemini Biological Products). For transient expression of sodium channels for 125I-Css IV binding, tsA-201 cells were subcultured in 150-mm tissue culture plates 1 or 2 days before transfection. Cells were transfected with 50 μg of pCDM8 vector containing the Nav1.2a sodium channel cDNA by using calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation (40Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected for membrane preparation 40-48 h after transfection. Membranes were prepared, and specific binding of 125I-Css IV toxin was measured as previously described (34Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Results are presented as means ± S.E., and differences were judged to be significant at p < 0.05. Electrophysiological Recording and Analysis—Transient expression for electrophysiological analysis of sodium channels was done by calcium phosphate-mediated co-transfection of tsA201-cells in a 35-mm dish with a 10:1 molar ratio of sodium channel plasmid and pEBO-pCD8-leu2, a vector encoding the CD8 antigen as described (40Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were subcultured on the day following transfection, then analyzed 40-72 h after transfection. Cells expressing the CD8 antigen were identified by incubation with polystyrene microspheres precoated with anti-CD8 antibody and used for electrophysiological recordings. Whole cell sodium currents were recorded from tsA-201 cells expressing Nav1.2a wild-type or mutant α subunits. Recording solutions (in mm) are as follows: extracellular, 150 NaCl, 10 Cs-HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 KCl, and 1.5 CaCl2, pH 7.4; intracellular, 190 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 HEPES, 4 MgCl2, 10 NaCl, and 5 EGTA, pH 7.4 with H2SO4. For the experiments of Figs. 1 (b-e) and 2, the following solutions were used: extracellular, 140 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4; intracellular, 90 CsF, 50 CsCl, 10 CsEGTA, 10 NaF, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Patch electrodes were pulled from 75-μl micropipette glass (VWR Scientific) and were fire-polished before use. Electrode resistances were typically 1.5-2.5 mΩ in the bath. Recordings were obtained using an Axopatch 1C Amplifier (Axon Instruments). Voltage pulses were applied, and data were acquired using Pulse software (Heka, Lambrecht, Germany). Linear leak and capacitance currents have been subtracted using an online P/-4 subtraction paradigm. Css IV was dissolved in the extracellular solution at the final concentration and placed in the recording bath. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Conductance voltage curves were derived from peak sodium current versus voltage measurements according to the equation, G = I/(V-VR), where I is the peak current, V is the test voltage, and VR is the apparent reversal potential. Normalized conductance-voltage curves were fit with a Boltzmann relationship of the form, 1/(1 + exp((V½-V)/k)), or with the sum of two such expressions, where Va is the voltage for half-maximal activation and k is a slope factor expressed in millivolts. All measurements are presented as means ± S.E.FIGURE 2Dependence of the rate of shift of the voltage dependence of activation on Css IV concentration.

The alignment of segments S3 and S4 was then manually adjusted using the KvAP channel voltage sensor structure (17Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

The best model was chosen as a center of the biggest cluster, defined as having the lowest standard mean deviation value (between positions of Cα atoms of all residues) to all other models in a cluster. After failed attempts to generate a docking model that would fit most of the experimental data using the original KvAP structure backbone coordinates, the best Na+ channel homology/de novo model was manually adjusted to create a larger space for Css IV to bind in the extracellular lumen between transmembrane segments S1-S2 and S3-S4 by adjusting the ψ torsion angle by -10° at position Gly822 (see Fig. 9), so that Cα of Val843 in the S3-S4 loop moved away from the S1-S2 loop by ∼5 Å. Docking simulations of the β-scorpion toxin binding to the Nav1.2 channel domain II S1-S4 segments were performed using the Rosetta-Dock program (49Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O.

Five thousand models were generated followed by model clustering, and the best model was chosen as the lowest scoring model among the top three clusters. A Two-step Mechanism for Binding and Voltage Sensor Trapping by Css IV Toxin—Incubation of tsA-201 cells expressing sodium channels with Css IV toxin at a negative membrane potential has no effect on sodium channel function, but strong depolarization to fully activate sodium channels in the presence of Css IV toxin strongly enhances the activation process by shifting its voltage dependence negatively by 32 mV (34Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Based on the voltage sensor-trapping model (34Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), we hypothe sized that this process involves a two-step mechanism of toxin action: first binding to sodium channels without functional effect on activation at the resting membrane potential followed by trapping the IIS4 voltage sensor in its activated conformation upon channel activation in the presence of bound toxin. In our previous experiments, we measured concentration-dependent toxin binding directly using radioligand-binding methods, but sequential binding to the resting state and subsequent voltage sensor trapping were not directly demonstrated. To address this key point, we allowed Css IV toxin to bind to sodium channels in the resting state in transfected cells under whole cell voltage clamp, and we measured the rapid kinetics of its voltage sensor-trapping action by strongly depolarizing for a brief period and then determining the sodium currents elicited by a test pulse to a negative membrane potential at which only toxin-modified channels can activate. If rapid voltage sensor trapping follows slow binding to the resting state, the negatively shifted activation of the channel should develop rapidly upon depolarization and be concentration-independent in this experimental protocol. Under control conditions, strong depolarization to 50 mV had no effect on sodium current (Fig. 1a). After binding of Css IV toxin, a strong, brief prepulse to +50 mV for 1 ms caused a large increase in sodium currents in subsequent test pulses to -50 mV or -45 mV (Fig. 1, b and c), and these toxin-modified sodium channels activated much more rapidly than unmodified sodium channels (Fig. 1, b and c, scaled dotted lines). Moreover, these sodium channels were activated at -40 mV and -35 mV without a prepulse, and activation was still accelerated significantly after the prepulse in the presence of toxin (Fig. 1, d and e). No such acceleration of activation by depolarizing prepulses was observed in the absence of toxin (Fig. 1a). These results indicate that sodium channels are modified by bound Css IV during 1-ms depolarizing pulses, and the modified channels immediately respond to a test depolarization with rapid activation of sodium current. Evidently, toxin binding has occurred before the prepulse, and then pre-bound toxin can trap the voltage sensor during the depolarization within 1 ms. If toxin binding does indeed occur before voltage sensor trapping, the effect of the toxin during the depolarizing prepulse should be concentration-independent. To test this prediction, the time course of development of the toxin-modified population of channels was measured in the presence of either 40 or 400 nm Css IV toxin. Cells were depolarized to a prepulse potential of +20 mV for a variable time from 0.1 to 1.4 ms, and the activation of sodium currents was measured in a subsequent test pulse to -65 mV where only toxin-modified channels are activated (Fig. 2, a and b). Fitting the resulting data to a single exponential equation yielded time constants for toxin action (Fig. 2c) with mean values of 0.48 ms at 40 nm and 0.53 ms at 400 nm (Fig. 2d), demonstrating that toxin action during the depolarizing prepulse is concentration-independent. Similar results were obtained for prepulses to 20, 50, and 80 mV (Fig. 2d). Evidently, β-scorpion toxins bind to sodium channels in the resting state in a concentration-dependent manner, as observed in our previous ligand binding studies (34Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and the pre-bound toxin traps the voltage sensor in its activated conformation in a rapid, concentration-independent, zero-order interaction after activation of the channel. If voltage sensor trapping during brief depolarizing prepulses requires outward movement of the voltage sensors into their activated state, the time and voltage dependence of this process should resemble the time and voltage dependence of movement of the IIS4 voltage sensor, which has been measured by fluorescent labeling of the S4 segment of NaV1.4 channels (14Chanda B. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We measured the time course of voltage sensor trapping during prepulses of 0- to 2-ms duration to a range of potentials from -50 mV to +20 mV (Fig. 3). Voltage sensor trapping was assessed by measurement of channel activation in a test pulse to -65 mV, at which only toxin-modified channels are activated (34Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Voltage sensor trapping was observed for prepulses more positive than -50 mV, and the rate of this process increased to a maximum at -10 mV (Fig. 3a). The time course of voltage sensor trapping could be fit empirically with a delay followed by a single exponential rate process (Fig. 3a). The delay (Fig. 3c), the rate constant for voltage sensor trapping (Fig. 3d), and the extent of voltage trapping at 2 ms (Fig. 3b) were all voltage-dependent, with large changes in the voltage range from -50 mV to -20 mV and smaller changes at more positive membrane potentials. We used a simple, two-step kinetic model to simulate the voltage sensor-trapping process (Fig. 3e), in which the first, voltage-dependent step represents the outward movement of the IIS4 voltage sensor from its resting to its activated position and the second, voltage-independent step represents interaction of the bound Css IV toxin with the activated conformation of the voltage sensor. From this simulation, we estimate that the rates of the voltage-dependent"

We have recently discovered that Bax phosphorylation at serine 184 induced by nicotine through activation of protein kinase AKT abolishes its proapoptotic function in human lung cancer cells. Here we found that either treatment of cells with the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor okadaic acid or specific disruption of PP2A activity by expression of SV40 small tumor antigen enhanced Bax phosphorylation, whereas C2-ceramide, a potent PP2A activator, reduced nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation, suggesting that PP2A may function as a physiological Bax phosphatase. PP2A co-localized and interacted with Bax. Purified, active PP2A directly dephosphorylated Bax in vitro. Overexpression of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A/C) suppressed nicotine-stimulated Bax phosphorylation in association with increased apoptotic cell death. By contrast, depletion of PP2A/C by RNA interference enhanced Bax phosphorylation and prolonged cell survival. Mechanistically C2-ceramide-induced Bax dephosphorylation caused a conformational change by exposure of the 6A7 epitope (amino acids 13-19) that is normally hidden at its N terminus that promoted the insertion of Bax into mitochondrial membranes and formation of Bax oligomers leading to cytochrome c release and apoptosis. In addition, PP2A directly disrupted the Bcl2/Bax association to liberate Bax from the heterodimer complex. Thus, PP2A may function as a physiological Bax regulatory phosphatase that not only dephosphorylates Bax but also activates its proapoptotic function.

Thus, PP2A may function as a physiological Bax regulatory phosphatase that not only dephosphorylates Bax but also activates its proapoptotic function. Apoptosis occurs by activation of an intrinsic or extrinsic pathway and is largely regulated by the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators that is comprised of three subfamilies (1Adams J.M. Cory S.

It is popularly held that antiapoptotic Bcl2 and Bcl-XL heterodimerize with proapoptotic Bax or Bak such that the hydrophobic crevices on their surfaces bind to the exposed BH3 domain of Bax or Bak to block their proapoptotic function. Thus, heterodimerization appears to regulate, at least in part, cell survival or death (5Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5823) Google Scholar). Furthermore the BH3 domain of the proapoptotic members is required for both their oligomerization and killing activity, although homodimerization does not necessarily correlate with killing activity (9Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Genetic studies using Bax and Bak single and double homozygous knock-out mice reveal that either Bax or Bak is essential for inducing mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by the release of potent caspase activators including cytochrome c (Cyt c) and Smac/Diablo that initiate the intrinsic pathway (10Wei M. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar).

However, whether a physiological phosphatase is involved in dephosphorylation of Bax remains unclear. Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase that participates in many signaling pathways in mammalian cells (14Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). It is a heterotrimer consisting of a 36-kDa catalytic subunit (PP2A/C), a 65-kDa structural A subunit (PP2A/A), and a variable regulatory subunit (PP2A/B, which can vary in size from 50 to 130 kDa). The AC catalytic complex alone has phosphatase activity, whereas the distinct B subunits can recruit PP2A/C to distinct subcellular locations and then define a specific substrate target (15Cegielska A.

Baumgartner S. Bilbe G. Ohkura H. Glover D. Hemmings B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These two subunits form a catalytic complex (PP2A/AC) that interacts with at least three families of regulatory subunits (B, B′, and B″) and tumor antigens (i.e. SV40 small tumor antigen; Ref. 14Mumby M.C.

Pharmacol. 1997; 41: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that treatment of cells with water-soluble analogs of ceramide such as C2-ceramide potently induces apoptotic cell death (29Ruvolo P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 30Ruvolo P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Ceramide may have multiple targets in regulating apoptotic cell death, one of which is PP2A because ceramide is able to stimulate PP2A activity through binding of its catalytic subunit (31Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Intriguingly the ceramide-activated PP2A is able to dephosphorylate and inactivate mitochondrial Bcl2 in association with increased apoptotic cell death (29Ruvolo P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The C2-ceramide mediates dephosphorylation of Bcl2 following translocation of PP2A to the mitochondria (30Ruvolo P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because Bax is a phosphorylatable protein in the Bcl2 family, it is possible that PP2A may also function as a physiological Bax phosphatase to dephosphorylate Bax and regulate its proapoptotic activity. Here we experimentally tested this hypothesis. Materials—Nicotine and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma. Okadaic acid, C2-ceramide, and purified PP2A were obtained from Calbiochem. AKT and phosphospecific AKT antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). PP2A/C siRNA, anti-Bax, anti-SV40 small tumor (small t) antigen, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Purified anti-Bax monoclonal 6A7 antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Cross-linkers bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and disuccinimidyl suberate were purchased from Pierce. The HA-tagged PP2A/C/pCDNA3 construct was generously provided by Dr. Brian Law (University of Florida). Wild type small t antigen cDNA in pCMV5 was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—A549 cells were cultured in F-12K medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm l-glutamine. H69, H82, H23, H358, H157, H460, and H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis— Cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 60 min. After treatment of cells with an agonist or inhibitor for various times, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed in detergent buffer. Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody. The samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at -80 °C. Bax phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot using a Bax antibody and developed using an ECL kit from Amersham Biosciences as described previously (11Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Bax in Vitro—A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine for 60 min. 32P-Labeled Bax was immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated Bax antibody. The beads were washed three times in detergent buffer and resuspended in 60 μl of phosphatase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Purified PP2A (50 ng) was added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for various times as described previously (32Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 5 min before loading onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bax phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—A549 cells were seeded and cultured on a Lab-Tek® chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol and acetone, and blocked with 10% mouse and rabbit serum. Then cells were incubated with mouse anti-human Bax and rabbit anti-human PP2A/C primary antibodies for 90 min. After washing, samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for 60 min. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Pictures were taken and colored with the same exposure setting for each experiment. To determine subcellular regions of protein co-localization, individual red- and green-stained images derived from the same field were merged using Openlab 3.1.5 software from Improvision, Inc. (Lexington, MA). Areas of protein co-localization appear yellow. Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (2 × 107) were washed with cold 1× PBS and resuspended in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem), homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer operating for four bursts of 10 s each at a setting of 5, and then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to pellet mitochondria as described previously (11Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The second supernatant was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet light membranes. The resulting supernatant is the cytosolic fraction. Mitochondria were washed with mitochondrial buffer twice, resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant containing mitochondrial proteins was collected. Protein (100 μg) from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bax was analyzed by Western blot using a Bax antibody. The purity of each fraction was confirmed by assessing localization of the mitochondria-specific protein prohibitin (33Ikonen E. Fiedler K. Parton R.G. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Alkali Extraction of Bax, Which Is Peripherally Associated with Mitochondrial Membranes—Cells were treated with C2-ceramide (30 μm) for various times. Mitochondria were isolated by subcellular fractionation, resuspended in freshly prepared 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min, and the alkali-extracted membrane pellet was resuspended with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, rocked for 60 min, and then centrifuged at 17,530 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the nonextractable mitochondrial proteins was collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The alkali-resistant Bax (i.e. nonextractable or integral) was determined by Western blot using a Bax antibody as described previously (34Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 35Cao X. Deng X. May W.S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of Bax in Mitochondrial Membranes—A549 cells were treated with C2-ceramide (30 μm) for various times. The mitochondrial membrane fraction was isolated as described above. Mitochondrial protein (0.5 mg) was resuspended in 400 μl of mitochondrial buffer. Cross-linkers bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and disuccinimidyl suberate were added simultaneously to a final concentration of 5 mm. Incubation was carried out at room temperature for 30 min, and then the reaction was quenched by addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 20 mm as described previously (35Cao X. Deng X. May W.S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The heavy membrane fraction was then lysed, and lysate protein (40 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with an anti-Bax antibody. Knockdown of PP2A Catalytic Subunit by RNA Interference (RNAi)— Human PP2A/C siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was transfected into A549 cells by using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A control siRNA (non-homologous to any known gene sequence) was used as a negative control. The levels of PP2A/C expression were determined by Western blot using a PP2A/C antibody. Bax phosphorylation or cell viability was assessed following various treatments as described. Three independent experiments were conducted for specific silencing of the targeted PP2A/C gene. Vector-based Gene Silencing of Bax by RNAi—The Bax DNA target sequence for siRNA design is AACTGATCAGAACCATCATGG. This was determined by using the Ambion (Austin, TX) siRNA Target Finder according to the human Bax cDNA sequence. The Bax-specific hairpin siRNA insert (sense-loop-antisense) was determined using a computerized insert design tool based on a target sequence following instructions on the Ambion web site. Then the oligonucleotide encoding the Bax-specific hairpin siRNA insert was synthesized and ligated into the pSilencer™ 2.1-U6 hygro vector from Ambion. The pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro plasmids bearing the Bax hairpin siRNA were transfected into A549 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stable clones persistently producing Bax siRNA were selected using hygromycin (0.8 mg/ml). The levels of Bax expression were analyzed by Western blot using a Bax antibody. Cell Viability Assay—The apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit from Clontech according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of Annexin-Vlow cells (percentage of viable cells) or Annexin-Vhigh cells (percentage of apoptotic cells) was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (36Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Treatment of Cells with Okadaic Acid or Expression of Small T Antigen Results in Bax Phosphorylation and Enhanced Cell Survival—Our previous findings and those of others have demonstrated that phosphorylation of Bax at Ser-184 through protein kinase AKT negatively regulates the proapoptotic activity of Bax (11Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 12Gardai S.J. Hildeman D.A. Frankel S.K. Whitlock B.B. Frasch S.C. Borregaard N. Marrack P. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21085-21095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because Bax is extensively co-expressed with serine/threonine protein PP2A in both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A), PP2A may act as a physiological phosphatase to dephosphorylate Bax. To test whether inhibition of PP2A activity affects Bax phosphorylation, A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with okadaic acid (OA) for various times. Bax phosphorylation was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results revealed that treatment of cells with OA enhanced Bax phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To further determine the subcellular localization of the phosphorylated Bax, A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with OA for 60 min. Bax was immunoprecipitated from isolated mitochondria or cytosol, respectively. Interestingly the phosphorylated (i.e. 32P-labeled) Bax was exclusively localized in cytosol (Fig. 1C). Because OA is an inhibitor for both PP2A and PP1 (32Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that an OA-sensitive phosphatase (PP2A or PP1) may be involved in regulating Bax dephosphorylation. It is well known that small t antigen can interact with the 36-kDa catalytic C and the 63-kDa A subunits of PP2A and that this can specifically disrupt PP2A but not PP1 activity (37Sontag E. Fedorov S. Kamibayashi C. Robbins D. Cobb M. Mumby M. Cell. 1993; 75: 887-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). To more specifically test whether PP2A is a physiological Bax phosphatase, the pCMV5/small t antigen construct was transfected into A549 cells. After transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid in the absence or presence of nicotine. Intriguingly expression of small t antigen not only resulted in Bax phosphorylation but also further enhanced nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation in association with prolonged cell survival (Fig. 1, D, E, and F). These findings strongly suggest that PP2A may function as a physiological Bax phosphatase to regulate Bax dephosphorylation as well as its proapoptotic activity. In untreated cells, the low or undetectable levels of Bax phosphorylation observed may result from PP2A activity. Bax phosphorylation may be a dynamic process, which is regulated by a Bax kinase (i.e. AKT; Ref. 11Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10781-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and phosphatase (i.e. PP2A). Thus, protein kinase-mediated constitutive phosphorylation of Bax may occur in untreated cells because specific inhibition of PP2A activity by small t antigen up-regulates Bax phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Ceramide Inhibits Nicotine-induced Bax Phosphorylation and Enhances Apoptosis—Because ceramide is a potent pharmacological activator of PP2A (29Ruvolo P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 31Law B. Rossie S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12808-12813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), it is possible that ceramide may induce Bax dephosphorylation through activation of PP2A. To test this, A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of C2-ceramide. Results clearly indicated that C2-ceramide suppressed nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Importantly treatment of cells with C2-ceramide blocked nicotine-stimulated cell survival (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that ceramide-activated PP2A may reduce Bax phosphorylation level via dephosphorylation. To further test whether other species of ceramide or TNFα (a ceramide inducer; Ref. 23Obeid L.M. Lindardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar) affect Bax phosphorylation, A549 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of C2-, C6-, C16-ceramide, or TNFα. Importantly C6-, C16-ceramide, or TNFα played a similar role in suppression of nicotine-induced Bax phosphorylation compared with C2-ceramide (Fig. 2C). This may occur through a similar mechanism involving PP2A. PP2A Co-localizes and Interacts with Bax—To assess a potential direct role for PP2A as a physiological Bax phosphatase, subcellular distribution of PP2A/C and Bax was examined by immunofluorescent staining. A mouse antibody against human Bax, rabbit polyclonal PP2A/C antibody, and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse (green) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit (red) secondary antibodies were used so that cells could be simultaneously stained without cross-reaction. As shown in Fig. 3A, Bax was primarily co-localized with PP2A/C in the cytoplasm of A549 cells. To test whether ceramide-activated PP2A enhances an association between PP2A and Bax, A549 cells were treated with C2-ceramide (30 μm) for various times. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out using an agarose-conjugated Bax or PP2A/C antibody, respectively. Bax-associated PP2A/C (i.e. bound PP2A/C) and PP2A/C-associated Bax (i.e. bound Bax) were analyzed by Western blotting using a PP2A/C or Bax antibody, respectively. Results revealed that treatment of cells with C2-ceramide promoted PP2A/C to associate with Bax in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Thus, PP2A/C may potentially function as a physiological phosphatase for Bax to regulate its activity in human lung cancer cells. A rabbit preimmune serum was used as a co"

Cytotoxicity of iodine on cultured human breast cancer cell lines, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, ZR-75-1, and T-47D, is reported in this communication. Iodine induced apoptosis in all of the cell lines tested, except MDA-MB-231, shown by sub-G1 peak analysis using flow cytometry. Iodine inhibited proliferation of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, it did not induce apoptosis in these cells. The iodine-induced apoptotic mechanism was studied in MCF-7 cells. DNA fragmentation analysis confirmed internucleosomal DNA degradation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling established that iodine induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells. Iodine-induced apoptosis was independent of caspases. Iodine dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential, exhibited antioxidant activity, and caused depletion in total cellular thiol content. Western blot results showed a decrease in Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the activation and mitochondrial membrane localization of Bax. Ectopic Bcl-2 overexpression did not rescue iodine-induced cell death. Iodine treatment induces the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor from mitochondria to the nucleus, and treatment of N-acetyl-l-cysteine prior to iodine exposure restored basal thiol content, ROS levels, and completely inhibited nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor and subsequently cell death, indicating that thiol depletion may play an important role in iodine-induced cell death. These results demonstrate that iodine treatment activates a caspase-independent and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.

These results demonstrate that iodine treatment activates a caspase-independent and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Iodine is essential to maintaining the normalcy of the thyroid and the breast. An iodine-deficient state renders the rat thyroid and the breast susceptible to physiological changes and leads to atypia, dysplasia, and hyperplasia (1Eskin B.A. Shuman R. Krouse T. Merion J.A. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 2332-2339PubMed Google Scholar). The results of iodine replacement therapy in the iodine-deficient rat model shows that different forms of iodine have different tissue responses; iodide (I-) is found to restore the normal morphology and physiology of the thyroid gland, whereas molecular iodine (I2) results in a decrease of rat breast hyperplasia and perilobular/ductal fibrosis (2Eskin B.A. Grotkowski C.E. Connolly C.P. Ghent W.R. Biol. Trace. Elem. Res. 1995; 49: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The beneficial effect of molecular iodine has also been documented in the human fibrocystic breast condition and in cyclic mastalgia (3Ghent W.R. Eskin B.A. Low D.A. Hill L.P. Can. J.

Iodine, in conjunction with medroxy progesterone acetate (5Funahashi H. Imai T. Tanaka Y. Tobinaga J. Wada M. Morita T. Yamada F. Tsukamura K. Oiwa M. Kikumori T. Narita T. Takagi H. J. Surg.

Hayakawa Y. Kikumori T. Mase T. Itoh T. Nishikawa M. Hayashi H. Shibata A. Hibi Y. Takahashi M. Narita T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Iodide excess is known to induce apoptosis in the thyroid cells in vitro (7Vitale M. Di Matola T. D'Ascoli F. Salzano S. Bogazzi F. Fenzi G. Martino E. Rossi G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and also in sodium iodide symporter and thyroperoxidase stably transfected non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (8Zhang L. Sharma S. Zhu L.X. Kogai T. Hershman J.M. Brent G.A. Dubinett S.M. Huang M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5065-5072PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies show that sodium iodide symporter facilitates iodide transport, and thyroperoxidase oxidizes iodide (I-) to iodine (I2), which is important for its organification (9Dohan O. De la Vieja A. Paroder V. Riedel C. Artani M. Reed M. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 48-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Propyl-thiouracil, an inhibitor of peroxidase, completely abolishes the cell death-inducing effect of iodide in thyroid cells, establishing I2 as the mediator of apoptosis (7Vitale M. Di Matola T. D'Ascoli F. Salzano S. Bogazzi F. Fenzi G. Martino E. Rossi G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The enhanced expression of sodium iodide symporter in human breast cancer tissue has been reported; however, its significance is unknown (9Dohan O. De la Vieja A. Paroder V. Riedel C. Artani M. Reed M. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 48-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 10Upadhyay G. Singh R. Agarwal G. Mishra S.K. Pal L. Pradhan P.K. Das B.K. Godbole M.M. Breast. Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 77: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to this, non-lactating breast tissue is known to be peroxidase-poor (11Strum J.M. Anat. Rec. 1978; 192: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and does not provide milieu conducive for iodide organification. On the other hand, molecular iodine is a highly reactive species and can be utilized without involvement of sodium iodide symporter and peroxidase activity (12Garcia-Solis P. Alfaro Y. Anguiano B. Delgado G. Guzman R.C. Nandi S. Diaz-Munoz M. Vazquez-Martinez O. Aceves C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 236: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies performed in the cell-free system show that iodine exposure to mitochondria isolated from breast tumor tissue causes swelling, organification of the mitochondrial proteins, and release of apoptogenic effectors from mitochondria that cause nuclear fragmentation (13Upadhyay G. Singh R. Sharma R. Balapure A.K. Godbole M.M. Mitochondrion. 2002; 2: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mechanism of iodine action in breast cancer cells has not been studied to date. This led us to investigate the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of iodine on breast cancer cells, which can be mediated through apoptosis. Apoptosis is a physiological cell suicide program critical to development and tissue homeostasis. The caspases, a family of intracellular cysteine proteases, are the central executioners of apoptosis. Effector caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7, are activated by initiator caspases, such as caspase-9, through proteolytic cleavage. Once activated, effector caspases are responsible for the digestion of a diverse array of structural and regulatory proteins, resulting in an apoptotic phenotype (14Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, divergent cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, heat shock, oxidative stress, withdrawal of growth factor, etc., also converge on mitochondria. Decrease in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and altered cellular redox state are the early changes in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (15Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Mitochondrial intermembrane space contains several proteins that can either induce apoptosis involving caspases (e.g. cytochrome c), the secondary mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac) and HtrA2/Omi or execute a caspase-independent apoptotic death program through apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) 3The abbreviations used are: AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; DCF-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid; PI, propidium iodide; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; ROS, reactive oxygen species, Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and endonuclease G (16Liu X.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins, with both anti-apoptotic as well as pro-apoptotic members, is implicated in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Two of the anti-apoptotic members, namely Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, confer resistance to apoptosis induced by a number of stimuli, whereas the other homologues Bid, Bax, Bak, and BH-3 domain-only proteins promote apoptosis (23Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 24Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar). This study elucidates the detailed mechanism of molecular iodine-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Iodine treatment induces changes in members of Bcl-2 family proteins and leads to the activation and translocation of Bax to mitochondria. The release of AIF from mitochondria executes nuclear fragmentation in a caspase-independent manner. The results show that iodine exhibits strong antioxidant activity, and thiol depletion seems to play an important role in iodine-induced apoptosis. Reagents and Antibodies—Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture, iodine, potassium iodide, DCF-DA, DTNB, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, propidium iodide (PI), JC-1, and RNase A were procured from Sigma. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies against caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bax, AIF, phosphorylated c-Jun, and β-actin, and secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies for p53, caspase-7, and cytochrome c (7H8.2C12) were kindly gifted by Drs. A. Sparks, Xiao-Ming Sun, and R. Jemmerson, respectively. Inhibitors specific to JNK (SP600015) and p38 (SB203580) were purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human breast cancer cell lines, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, ZR-75-1, and T-47D, were procured from the National Centre of Cell Sciences (Pune, India). Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy volunteers using Lymphoprep lymphocyte separation medium (Eurobio). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified environment of 5% CO2. pCAGGS-hbcl-2 carrying cDNA for the human bcl-2 gene was a kind gift from Dr. Tsujimoto (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine). To establish the Bcl-2-overexpressing MCF-7 cell line, 0.1 million MCF-7 cells were plated in a 33-mm2 culture dish for 24 h before transfection and then co-transfected with either 1 μg of pCAGGS-hbcl-2 or control vector pCAGGS and 0.1 μg of pCDNA3 (for neomycin selection) using Cytofectene (Bio-Rad). The transfected cells were selected with geneticin (500 μg/ml) for 24 h followed by 100 μg/ml for 2 weeks. Stably transfected clones were analyzed for Bcl-2 expression levels by Western blotting. Cytotoxicity Assay—The cytotoxic effect of iodine on breast cancer cell lines was analyzed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Human PBMCs were used as a non-cancerous cell control. The iodine solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of iodine and 2 g of potassium iodide in 100 ml of water. The amount of molecular iodine was estimated using the sodium thiosulfate titration method (25Kenkel J. Analytical Chemistry for Technicians.2nd Ed. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL1994: 164-166Google Scholar). Accordingly, stock solution of 75 μm iodine was prepared. Cells (2 × 104) were plated in a 24-well plate and treated with potassium iodide (5 mm), different concentrations of iodine (1-4 μm), or left untreated for 48 h. Cells were collected by trypsinization and counted using trypan blue staining. Experiments were performed in triplicates, and the mean values were calculated. IC50 values for each cell line were interpolated from the dose-response curve. Detection of Apoptosis—Flow cytometric analysis was performed to detect and quantify apoptosis. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and stained with 50 μg/ml PI in hypotonic lysis buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing DNase-free RNase A for 30 min. Acquisition and analysis was performed by FACScan using Cell Quest Alias software (BD Biosciences). Cells with their DNA content less than that of G1 phase cells (sub-G1) were assumed to be apoptotic. For DNA fragmentation analysis, MCF-7 cells were grown in 25-cm2 culture flasks and were left untreated or treated with iodine (1-4 μm). Both attached and detached cells were collected and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Supernatant was treated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) and RNase A (10 μg/ml), and DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with absolute ethanol. DNA samples were electrophoresed on 1.8% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For TUNEL assay, MCF-7 cells on the coverslips, left untreated or treated (1-4 μm) with iodine for different time points, were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, the assay was performed using the ApoAlert® DNA fragmentation assay kit strictly according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Nuclei were counterstained with PI, and the TUNEL-positive cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Microphot 4T). Caspase Inhibition Assay—To study the involvement of caspases in iodine-induced apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 50 μm caspase inhibitors (R & D systems, Minneapolis, MN), general caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk), caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-fmk), caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk), and caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk) followed by iodine treatment at an IC50 iodine concentration of 2.7 μm for 48 h. Cell viability was determined using trypan blue staining. Measurement of Δψm, ROS, and Total GSH Content—The effect of iodine on the Δψm was determined using JC-1. This fluorescent probe exists as a green fluorescent monomer (emission 527 nm) at low mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by an increase in green fluorescence (FL-1). MCF-7 cells (0.2 million) in a 6-well plate were treated with 3 μm iodine for different time points. The cells were incubated with JC-1 (1 μm) in serum-free medium for 30 min before termination of the experiments, and Δψm was estimated in a minimum of 10,000 cells by FACScan. ROS generation was analyzed by flow cytometry using DCF-DA. MCF-7 cells were treated with iodine (3 μm) alone or pretreated with L-NAC (2 mm) or L-NAC alone for 24 h and incubated with 10 μm DCF-DA in serum-free medium for 30 min, and levels of ROS were estimated by FACScan. Total cellular thiol content was determined by a method described earlier (26Kurita T. Namiki H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell lysates were prepared as described above and stained with 1 ml of 20 mm DTNB. Prechilled ethanol (200 μl) was added to precipitate the macromolecules, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured with a Dynetech MR5000 (Chantilly, VA) microplate reader at 410 nm. Western Blotting—MCF-7 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 culture flasks and treated with 3 μm iodine for different time points. Attached and detached cells were disrupted in 50 mm phosphate buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and protease inhibitor mixture by rapid freeze-thaw cycles (three times). To prepare mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, the cells were homogenized using a Teflon homogenizer in ice-cold mitochondria buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g to remove nuclei. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant from this centrifugation represents the cytosolic fraction and was analyzed for the release of proteins from mitochondria. The purity of the cytosolic and membrane fraction was confirmed using biochemical assay for lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase, respectively. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). A 50-μg protein sample in each lane was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and nonspecific sites on the membrane were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody and subsequently with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Proteins were detected by Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with β-actin as a protein loading control. Immunofluorescence—MCF-7 cells were grown on sterile coverslips in a 6-well plate and treated with 3 μm iodine for 36 h. The cells were fixed with fresh 4% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C for 20 min and permeabilized with prechilled 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS. The cells were then incubated with goat anti-AIF antibody (1:100) in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. After PBS washes, nuclei were counterstained with PI. For analysis of the activation of Bax, cells were labeled with Mitotracker Red CM-H2Xros (Molecular Probes) at 200 nm for 45 min to localize the mitochondria. Cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.0125% CHAPS/PBS to prevent artificial activation of Bax (27Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with monoclonal anti-Bax YTH-6A7 antibody (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) at the dilution of 1:100, which recognizes only the activated form of Bax, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images were captured on a confocal microscope (Radiance 200100, Bio-Rad). Cytotoxicity of Iodine in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—For determining the effect of iodine on cell survival, five human breast cancer cell lines and PBMCs were incubated with increasing concentrations of iodine (1-4 μm) for 48 h or left untreated and analyzed for their viability using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Potassium iodide (5 mm) did not show any cytotoxicity (data not shown), and iodine treatment significantly decreased the cell viability of all of the cell lines and PBMCs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The cell number of all of the breast cancer cell lines at 4 μm iodine concentration decreased below the initial number after 48 h, indicating that iodine is cytotoxic to cells. Cells treated with iodine rounded up and detached from the substratum, indicating cell death (Fig. 1B). Nuclear staining using fluorescent DNA binding dye (Hoechst-33258) displayed the typical morphological features of apoptosis with nuclear fragmentation in the iodine (4 μm)-treated cell lines, except in MDA-MB-231 where nuclei were sickle-shaped but not fragmented (Fig. 1C). In addition to this, iodine exhibited a anti-proliferative effect on human PBMCs; however, nuclear fragmentation was not observed (Fig. 1). These results indicate that iodine not only inhibits cell growth but also induces cell death. Iodine Induces Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—To determine whether iodine-induced cytotoxicity is mediated through apoptosis, several assays were performed. Iodine-treated breast cancer cell lines were analyzed for their DNA content after staining with PI using FACScan. We found a dose-dependent increase of the cells in the sub-G1 population and >80% of the cells to be hypodiploid after a 4 μm iodine treatment for 48 h; however, hypodiploidy was not observed in iodine-treated MDA-MB-231 cells and human PBMCs (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with the absence of nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1B). DNA fragmentation analysis of iodine-treated MCF-7 cells showed a laddering pattern characteristic of apoptosis, indicating internucleosomal DNA degradation (Fig. 2C). MCF-7 cells were analyzed for TUNEL assay, a quantitative technique that reveals DNA strand breaks (Fig. 2D), and a dose- and time-dependent increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed (Fig. 2E). Iodine-induced Apoptosis Is Independent of Caspases—To test whether caspases are involved in iodine-induced apoptosis, the expression of effector caspase-3 and -7 was analyzed using Western blotting in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells are known not to express a functional caspase-3 (28Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). In agreement, we also did not find its expression, but observed a corresponding 32-kDa band in the MDA-MB-231 cell line used as a positive control (Fig. 3A). Caspase-7 is another effector caspase that can take over functions of caspase-3 under certain conditions (29Houde C. Banks K.G. Coulombe N. Rasper D. Grimm E. Roy S. Simpson E.M. Nicholson D.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9977-9984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although increase in the expression of procaspase-7 was observed, its cleaved forms were not detected (Fig. 3B). Additionally, caspase inhibition assay using a general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, as well as inhibitors specific to caspase-3, -8, and -9 (50 μm), did not affect cell viability of the untreated or iodine-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that iodine-induced apoptosis is independent of caspase activation. Iodine Induces Loss of Δψm and Decreases ROS Generation and Total Thiol Content—To determine the involvement of the mitochondria-mediated pathway in iodine-induced apoptotic cell death, we measured changes in Δψm. Iodine treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in a rapid dissipation of Δψm in a time-dependent manner detected by an increase in green fluorescence emission (Fig. 4A). We analyzed levels of ROS in iodine-treated MCF-7 cells and found a 4-fold decrease in cellular ROS after 24 h of iodine treatment (Fig. 4B). Iodine treatment was also found to lower total thiol content (Fig. 4C). Pretreatment of L-NAC (2 mm) not only restored basal thiol content (Fig. 4C) but also the ROS levels comparable with control cells (Fig. 4B). Role of Members of Bcl-2 Family Protein in Iodine-induced Apoptosis—To investigate whether iodine-induced apoptosis is a consequence of the altered expression of the members of Bcl-2 family proteins, Western blotting for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax was performed (Fig. 5A). There was a decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 in a time-dependent manner. The decrease was significant after 24 h, and after 48 h, expression decreased up to 5-fold of the control (Fig. 5B). There was no alteration in the expression of Bcl-xL (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, expression of Bax increased significantly after 12 h and was ∼7-fold higher in comparison to the control after 48 h of iodine treatment (Fig. 5B). Bax is known to be a transcriptional target of p53 (30Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis of p53 showed a time-dependent increase in its expression (Fig. 5, A and B). Bax has been shown to redistribute from cytosol to the mitochondria during the apoptotic process (31Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis of untreated and iodine-treated cells stained with a conformation-specific antibody against the N-terminal sequence of Bax (green fluorescence) revealed its mitochondrial localization. Mitotracker Red was used to localize mitochondria. No green fluorescence was visible in control cells after 36 h of iodine treatment, whereas such fluorescence was detected in iodine-treated cells and was co-localized with red fluorescence of Mitotracker and resulted in the yellow color in the overlaid figure (Fig. 5C). Release of Apoptogenic Molecules from Mitochondria—Decrease in Δψm and in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax results in the loss of selective permeability of mitochondrial membrane that leads to the release of apoptogenic proteins normally confined to mitochondrial intermembrane space. Results of Western blotting showed the presence of cytochrome c and AIF in the cytosolic fraction of iodine-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6A). AIF is synthesized as a 67-kDa preprotein and localizes in mitochondrial intermembrane space. Upon induction of apoptosis, AIF is processed to a 57-kDa form and released into the cytoplasm (32Otera H. Ohsakaya S. Nagaura Z. Ishihara N. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The Western blot result shows the presence of 67-kDa AIF in the control as well as the treated sample; however, the 57-kDa form of AIF was observed only in the 24-h-treated sample (Fig. 6A). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed translocation of AIF to the nucleus after 36 h of iodine treatment (Fig. 6B). Pretreatment of L-NAC (2 mm) for 1 h completely inhibited the nuclear translocation of AIF and completely inh"

During cytodifferentiation of odontoblasts there is a constant change of actively transcribed genes. Thus, tissue-specific matrix genes that are silenced in early differentiation are expressed during the terminal differentiation process. Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is an extracellular matrix, prototypical dentin, and a bone-specific gene, however, the molecular mechanisms by which it is temporally and spatially regulated are not clear. In this report, we demonstrate that dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), which is localized in the nucleus during early differentiation of odontoblasts, is able to bind specifically with the DSPP promoter and activate its transcription. We have identified the specific promoter sequence that binds specifically to the carboxyl end of DMP1. The DNA binding domain in DMP1 resides between amino acids 420 and 489. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the in vivo association of DMP1 with the DSPP promoter. Interactions between DMP1 and DSPP promoter thus provide the foundation to understand how DMP1 regulates the expression of the DSPP gene.

Odontoblast differentiation is a well designed process that couples cell-cycle withdrawal with the synthesis of dentin matrix proteins. A number of macromolecules are involved in dentin mineralization. One such protein, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) 2The abbreviations used are: DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; DMP1, dentin matrix protein 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromosomal immunoprecipitation; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; aa, amino acid(s); Ab, antibody. is produced by terminally differentiated odontoblasts and is known to modulate dentin mineralization. DSPP is a compound gene encoding for two proteins namely DSP (dentin sialoprotein) and PP (phosphophoryn) (1MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Earlier reports have indicated DSPP as the sole odontoblast-specific gene (2Begue-Kirn C. Krebsbach P.H. Bartlett J.D. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar); however, a recent report demonstrates low levels of expression in osteoblasts and calvarial tissue (3Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 179-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue-specific gene expression is complex and, among many events, requires the orderly binding of transcription factors to specific gene regulatory sequences, alteration of chromatin structure by acetyltransferases and demethylases, and recruitment of the RNA polymerase II complex (4Kornberg R.D. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: M46-M49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The temporal and spatial expression of DSPP is tightly regulated by the transcriptional elements in the promoter (5Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the regulatory elements controlling the temporal and spatial expression of DSPP, a DSPP promoter of ∼1.7 kb has been cloned and characterized to a certain extent (6Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Peterson M.C. Hao J. Kolsto A.B. Friedman A.D. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45423-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Deletion mapping experiments indicated the presence of various regulatory sequences (7Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The activity of this promoter has been demonstrated by transgenic technology with a reporter construct expressing LacZ under the control of the DSPP promoter (5Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that DSPP transcription is regulated by several positive and negative regulators of gene transcription in combination with the various signaling pathways/networks. Some of the negative factors known to down-regulate DSPP promoter activity have been reported earlier, including transforming growth factor β1 (8Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (6Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Peterson M.C. Hao J. Kolsto A.B. Friedman A.D. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45423-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and Nrf1 (6Narayanan K. Ramachandran A.

Odontoblast-specific overexpression of transforming growth factor β1 in the transgenic mouse model showed a reduced expression of DSPP (8Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) indicating that transforming growth factor β1-mediated signaling pathway down-regulates DSPP expression. Similarly we have shown that CAAT/enhancer-binding protein β and Nrf1 interact and down-regulate the expression of DSPP in odontoblasts (6Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Peterson M.C. Hao J. Kolsto A.B. Friedman A.D. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45423-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RUNX2 has been shown to differentially regulate the DSPP promoter activity during differentiation of odontoblasts (9Chen S. Rani S. Wu Y. Unterbrink A. Gu T.T. Gluhak-Heinrich J. Chuang H.H. Macdougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29717-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, RUNX2 down-regulates DSPP promoter activity in preodontoblasts while increasing its expression during terminal differentiation (9Chen S. Rani S. Wu Y. Unterbrink A. Gu T.T. Gluhak-Heinrich J. Chuang H.H. Macdougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29717-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, DSPP gene also undergoes several post-transcriptional modifications, a common one being alternative splicing. Several transcripts of various lengths have been identified for the DSPP gene (10Ritchie H.H. Wang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, a predominant message of ∼5 kb has been reported (11George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakura S.R. Liu K. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Currently, the significance of alternative splicing and DSPP function is not known. There is speculation that, after post-translational modification, DSPP synthesized as a “pro” form may be proteolytically cleaved to DSP and PP moieties. One major observation that supports this hypothesis is the absence of the holoprotein (DSPP) in mineralized dentin or in odontoblasts (12Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Pathologically, the DSPP gene has been indicated as the candidate gene for dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and III genetic disorder (13Thotakura S.R. Mah T. Srinivasan R. Takagi Y. Veis A.

However, the DSPP knock-out mice possessed a dentinogenesis imperfecta type III phenotype. This further complicates the significance of DSPP in these genetic disorders but also suggests that there may be one or more potential candidate genes for the dentinogenesis imperfecta type II genetic disorder. Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is a non-collagenous protein expressed in mineralized tissues (19George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DMP1 is an acidic protein rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine residues. Most of the serine residues are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (20George A. Gui J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Veis A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21D'Souza R.N. Cavender A. Sunavala S.G. Alvarez J. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. MacDougall M. J. Bone Miner.

Res. 1998; 13: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Various lines of evidence indicate that DMP1 functions as an important regulatory molecule in the bio-mineralization process. The role of DMP1 in the initiation of hydroxyapatite nucleation was demonstrated recently (23He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), which directly supports its role at the mineralization front. Furthermore, overexpression of DMP1 in a cell culture system augments the mineralization process both qualitatively and quantitatively (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Conversely, blocking translation of DMP1 by antisense techniques inhibited the mineralization process (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In summary, these results indicated that DMP1 has an important regulatory function in mineralization. However, Dmp1–/– mice had no major phenotypic abnormality in dentin and bone during early development, on the other hand, there were defects in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation (25Ye L. MacDougall M. Zhang S. Xie Y. Zhang J. Li Z. Lu Y. Mishina Y. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19141-19148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Ye L. Mishina Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6197-6203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). With progression of age, defects in bone and dentin were noted (25Ye L. MacDougall M. Zhang S. Xie Y. Zhang J. Li Z. Lu Y. Mishina Y. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19141-19148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Overall, the results from the DMP1 knock-out suggest that other compensatory mechanisms might be responsible for bone and dentin formation during early development. Apart from its role in mineralization, DMP1 has a putative function in modulating gene expression. Overexpression studies in mesenchymal stem cells have given insights into the role of DMP1 in regulating the expression of specific molecular markers of the osteoblast and odontoblast lineage, such as osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and DSPP (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Furthermore, blocking DMP1 expression by antisense techniques inhibited the expression of these genes (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). More recently, DMP1 has been implicated in more complex biological processes. We have shown by immunostaining that the primary localization of DMP1 is in the nucleus (27Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Further, Ca2+ was responsible for the export of DMP1 into the extracellular matrix during osteoblast differentiation. This bimodal pattern of localization provided direct evidence that DMP1 promotes the development of the odontoblast and osteoblast phenotype and performs other functions associated with their differentiated state. In this report, we have provided evidence to support the function of DMP1 as a transcriptional regulator of the DSPP gene. We have demonstrated the binding of DMP1 to the DSPP promoter using several lines of evidence, namely by DNA footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Transient transfection assays with DSPP promoter indicate that DMP1 positively regulates the DSPP promoter activity. Furthermore, when mutations to this binding site were introduced, these constructs failed to respond to the overexpression of DMP1. The in vivo binding of DMP1 to the DSPP promoter was further confirmed by ChIP analysis. We have also identified a potential DNA binding region within DMP1. With these data, we propose that DMP1 acts as a potential transcriptional regulator with respect to the regulation of DSPP during early odontoblast differentiation. Plasmids and Adenoviral Vectors—A 1.7-kb genomic fragment was amplified from rat genomic DNA to obtain the DSPP promoter (6Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Peterson M.C. Hao J. Kolsto A.B. Friedman A.D. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45423-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The promoter was sequence-verified and subcloned into pGL3 basic (Promega) vector at NheI and SmaI restriction sites. DSPP promoter deletions were made using specific primers. The adenoviral construct and viral infection of odontoblast cells were made as described earlier (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). DMP1 deletions were made by PCR reactions using HF-Taq polymerase (Clontech). The amplified fragments were sequence-verified for open reading frame and cloned into glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expression (pGEX4T-3) vector. Cell Culture and Transfections—An odontoblast cell line T4-4, developed by human telomerase reverse transcript (hTERT)-mediated immortalization as reported (28Hao J. Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. He G. Almushayt A. Evans C. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19976-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was used in this study. Odontoblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% Amphotericin B. Transient transfections with reporter plasmids were performed with SuperFect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter transfections were carried out in triplicates and repeated thrice to obtain a mean value. All transfections contained an internal control vector pRL-SV40, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter. Statistical significance was calculated using Student t test. Luciferase Assay—A dual luciferase assay system was purchased from Promega and used in the experiments. The luciferase activity was measured using an automated luminometer from Dynex as reported earlier (29Thotakura S.R. Karthikeyan N. Smith T. Liu K. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Dimethyl Sulfate Footprinting—DMS footprinting was followed as published (30Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and 31Valentin-Hansen P. Holst B. Josephsen J. Hammer K. Albrechtsen B. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment was incubated with DMP1 protein in foot-printing buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 μg of bovine serum albumin), and the binding was carried out for 30 min at 4 °C. 27 mm DMS (Aldrich Chemical Co.) in 0.6 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 8.0) was added, and the mixture was incubated further for 1 min. The DNA-protein complex was precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate and 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA with 3 volumes of cold 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was resuspended with 20 μl of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and incubated for 10 min at 90 °C. 2 μl of 1 m NaOH was added, and the mixture was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min. DNA was then precipitated by ethanol. The DNA pellet was resuspended in sample buffer containing 80% (v/v) formamide and subjected to electrophoresis on a 8% acrylamide gel in the presence of 8.3 m urea. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was carried out to monitor the protein binding sites on the DSPP promoter. Oligonucleotides were synthesized as listed in Table 1. The oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Protein-DNA interactions were performed for 45 min in 4 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 60 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 100 ng of poly(dG-dC) along with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Typically, 10 ng of purified DMP1 was incubated with 5 fmol of labeled oligonucleotides. Supershift experiments were carried out as described above except that the samples were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with DMP1 antibody. For competition binding assay, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were used at different concentrations.TABLE 1Primers used in the studyPrimers for EMSAFull: 1-CAACTTTAATGGGTACCTCAGGAATGATAGGGGTCTGAAA TAGCCAGCCAGTCCTATTTACTAG-64 (binding region identified by DMS footprinting)EMSA-Del 1: 22-GAATGATAGGGGTCTGAAATAGCCAGCCAGTCCTAT TTACTAG-64 (binding region 22-64 bp)EMSA-Del 2: 1-CAACTTTAATGGGTACCTCAGGAATGATAG-30 (binding region 1-30 bp)EMSA-Del 3: 22-GAATGATAGGGGTCTGAAATAGCCAGCCA-50 (binding region 22-50 bp)EMSA-MUT: 22-GAATGACTAGCTGATCAGGCGGCCAGCCA-50 (underlined bases were mutated in the conserved region shown in the supplementary data)Primers for DMP1 deletions (underlined bases were the added bases for the ease of cloning)FL-S: G GAT CCC ATG AAG ACT GTT ATC CTC CTT ACGFL-AS: GC GGC CGC GTA GCC ATC TTG GCA ATC ATTN-Term-S: G GAT CCC ATG AAG ACT GTT ATC CTC CTT ACGN-Term-AS: GC GGC CGC TTC CTG GGA TCC CTC ACC AGCC-Term-S: G GAT CCC AGC AGC AGC GAG TCT CAG GAAC-Term-AS: GC GGC CGC GTA GCC ATC TTG GCA ATC ATTDel 1-S: G GAT CCC AGC AGC AGC GAG TCT CAG GAADel 1-AS: GC GGC CGC CTC ATC CTG GGC CGA CTC CTG ACTDel 2-S: G GAT CCC GAG AGC CAG TCT GAG CAG GACDel 2-AS: GC GGC CGC GTA GCC ATC TTG GCA ATC ATTDel 3-S: G GAT CCC AGCCTCAGCCTCTCAGAGGAGDel 3-AS: GC GGC CGC CTC AGA CTG GCT CTC CTG ACT Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to mutate the DMP1 binding site on DSPP promoter (same as EMSA-MUT shown in Table 1) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). Northern Blotting—Messenger RNA was isolated from cultured cells at log phase using an Invitrogen mRNA isolation kit. RNA gel electrophoresis and Northern blotting were done as described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). 5 μg of mRNA was resolved on an 8% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized using PerfectHyb (Sigma) and probed with a randomly labeled appropriate probe. Random labeling was carried out using the Decaprime kit (Ambion Inc.). ChIP Assay—A ChIP assay kit obtained from Upstate Inc. was used in this experiment. Briefly MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with plasmid containing DSPP promoter. The DNA-protein complex was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors mixture and scraped into a conical tube. The cells were lysed with SDS-lysis buffer (provided in the kit) for 10 min. The DNA was recovered with phenol:chloroform and diluted 10 times. This sample is referred to as the input for the experiment. Respective primary antibody was added to the DNA sample and incubated 12–14 h at 4 °C. The antibody-complex was allowed to bind to Protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The DNA bound to the immune complexes was extracted with phenol:chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were used as templates for PCR to identify the presence of transfected plasmid DNA using specific primers. DMP1 Influences DSPP Expression—Overexpression studies conducted earlier indicated that expression of DMP1 in mesenchymal cells influence the expression of DSPP gene, indicating the role of DMP1 in the transcriptional regulation of DSPP (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Blocking DMP1 expression by antisense DMP1 constructs further confirmed that DSPP transcription is under the control of DMP1 (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In this study, transient transfections performed in odontoblasts with increasing concentration of DMP1 expression plasmid, resulted in a steady increase in the DSPP promoter activity. Overall, a 70% increase in the promoter activity in the presence of 0.3 μg of DMP1 expression plasmid (Fig. 1) was observed. The role of DMP1 in the regulation of DSPP gene was confirmed by overexpression studies using the adenoviral construct. Odontoblasts were infected with the cytomegalo-virus-driven DMP1 adenoviral constructs in both sense and antisense orientation. mRNA was isolated from these cells and analyzed for the expression levels of DSPP mRNA. Results in Fig. 2A indicate an increase in 40% of the message level of DSPP with the overexpression of DMP1. On the other hand, the overexpression of antisense DMP1 decreased the expression level of DSPP by 30% (Fig. 2B). Thus overexpression of DMP1 under cytomegalovirus promoter influences DSPP promoter activity. DMP1 Binding to the DSPP Promoter—The direct binding of DMP1 to the DSPP promoter was analyzed by EMSA experiments. The 1.7-kb DSPP promoter was PCR-amplified into smaller fragments of ∼500 bp using gene-specific primers. These fragments were end-labeled and used in EMSA studies. Results from these studies indicate that DMP1 binds to DSPP promoter between –450 bp to +80 bp relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 3). This fragment was further analyzed for specific DMP1 binding sequence by footprinting. Identification of the DMP1 Binding Sequence on the DSPP Promoter—DNA footprinting was carried out to identify the DMP1 binding sequence. A 450-bp DSPP promoter was PCR-amplified between –450 bp and +1 bp and was used in the DNA footprinting assay. DNA footprinting was carried out using DMS. One of the reasons for selecting chemical foot-printing is due to the problem encountered with the DNase I methodology. The presence of calcium in the DNase I reaction buffer affected the DNA binding property of DMP1. Results from the DMS footprinting assay are presented in Fig. 4, which shows that in the presence of DMP1 there is a protection of DNA between –417 and –353 nucleotides. The sequence that corresponds to this region is indicated in Fig. 4. Identification of the Core Binding Sequence—To identify the core sequence of the binding region, we performed EMSA with various oligonucleotides designed from the footprinting studies (Fig. 5). The 64-bp region identified by foot-printing was used as positive control (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3), oligonucleotides synthesized from 22 to 64 bp also contain the binding region as shown in lanes 4–6. However, oligonucleotides made in the region 1–30 bp failed to interact with DMP1 protein (lanes 7–9), whereas oligonucleotides containing the region from 22 to 50 bp was shown to interact with the DMP1 protein (Fig. 5, lanes 10–12). These results indicate that the region spanning 22–50 bp of the sequence identified by the DNA footprinting assay contained the DMP1 binding region. The specificity of this binding region was further confirmed by competition assay in the presence of varying concentrations of cold oligonucleotides. Results from the EMSA study demonstrated that, with increasing concentration of cold oligonucleotides, the binding of DMP1 to the labeled oligonucleotides reduced gradually, indicating the specificity of the binding interaction (Fig. 6A). The specificity of DMP1 binding to the DNA was further confirmed by the supershift EMSA in the presence of DMP1-specific antibody (Fig. 6B). A supershift was observed in the presence of DMP1 antibody as presented in lane 3, indicating the specific binding of DMP1 to its responsive element. Mutations were introduced in the oligonucleotides (in the conserved region shown in the supplementary data) and DMP1 binding was analyzed by EMSA. Results suggested that DMP1 failed to interact with its binding site upon mutation (Fig. 6B, lane 2).FIGURE 6Competition and supershift assay. Oligonucleotides corresponding to 22–50 bp (EMSA-Del3) of the sequence identified by DMS footprinting were end-labeled. The competition assay (A) was carried out in the presence of -fold excess of cold (unlabeled) oligonucleotides. Lane 1 represents 5 fmol of labeled oligonucleotides incubated with 5 ng of purified DMP1. Lane 2 represents 5-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides, and lane 3 represents 10-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides. The supershift assay (B) was carried out in the presence of affinity-purified DMP1 antibody. 5 ng of DMP1 protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-DMP1 IgG in the binding buffer prior to incubation with the labeled oligonucleotides. The antibody-protein complex was incubated with end-labeledoligonucleotidesandanalyzedonSDS-PAGE. InB:lane1, with DMP1;lane2, EMSA-mut; and lane 3, with DMP1 and DMP1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of DMP1 to the DSPP promoter region was further substantiated by introducing mutations (EMSA-MUT) on the DSPP promoter using primers listed in Table 1. Mutations were specifically incorporated at the DMP1 binding site. Promoter activity assay further revealed that the DSPP promoter failed to respond to the overexpression of DMP1 in odontoblasts when compared with the wild-type promoter activity (Fig. 7). Identification of the DNA Binding Domain within DMP1—Deletion analyses were performed to identify the DNA binding domain within the DMP1 protein. Initially DMP1 deletions were made in such a way to express two truncated proteins; one polypeptide containing the N-terminal domain (1–321 aa) and the other C-terminal domain (321–489 aa). These proteins were purified and used in EMSA studies. Results from EMSA indicated that the C-terminal region of DMP1 has the DNA binding potential (Fig. 8A). To narrow down the binding site further, additional deletions (as shown in Table 1) were made within the C-terminal region of DMP1, and these polypeptides were used in EMSA (Fig. 8B). Results in Fig. 8B indicate that the DNA binding region resides between 420 and 489 aa (QDSRSEENRDSDSQDSSRSKEESNSTGSTSSSEEDNHPKNIEADNRKLIVDAYHNKPIGDQDDNDCQDGY). ChIP Assay Demonstrating DMP1 Binding to the DSPP Promoter—To demonstrate the in vivo interaction between DMP1 and DSPP promoter, a ChIP assay was performed. This analysis was carried out using affinity-purified DMP1-specific antibody. The region of interest of DSPP promoter was amplified upon immunoprecipitation with DMP1 antibody. Results from the ChIP assay demonstrate that DMP1 binds to the DSPP promoter, on the other hand, DMP1 failed to bind to DSPP promoter, which had mutated DMP1 binding sites (Fig. 9). These results clearly indicate that DMP1 has the potential to bind to the DSPP promoter in vivo. Molecular mechanisms controlling tissue-specific gene expression is a challenging topic. DSPP is specifically expressed by the odontoblasts (2Begue-Kirn C. Krebsbach P.H. Bartlett J.D. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral. Sci. 1998; 106: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and recently reported to be also synthesized at very low levels by osteoblasts (3Qin C. Brunn J.C. Cadena E. Ridall A. Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 2003; 44: 179-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now known that DSPP is a complex gene coding for two protein products namely DSP and PP (7Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). DMP1 is a secreted, extracellular matrix-associated, acidic protein that regulates many cellular functions, including differentiation and matrix production by both osteoblasts and odontoblasts (19George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional importance of DMP1 emerged with the observation that overexpression of DMP1 leads to differentiation of embryonic mesenchymal cells into terminally differentiated odontoblast-like cells (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). One of the genes up-regulated during this process is DSPP, and antisense DMP1 abrogated DSPP expression. These experiments laid the foundation for further investigation of the specific role of DMP1 in regulating the expression of DSPP. Studies have shown that, early on during the cytodifferentiation of osteoblasts and odontoblasts, DMP1 can be localized in the nucleus (27Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). DMP1 localized in the nucleus is unphosphorylated, and we speculate that this non-post-translationally modified DMP1 can act as a transcriptional regulator. In this report, we provide evidence for a functional role for DMP1 in the nucleus; namely, it acts as a transcriptional enhancer for the tooth/bone-specific gene DSPP. Several lines of evidence presented here indicate that DMP1 binds directly to the DSPP promoter. The DMP1 binding site on the DSPP promoter was identified by DNA footprinting. The core binding region was identified by EMSA, and mutation of the DMP1 binding region abolished the DMP1-mediated activation of DSPP promoter activity. Furthermore, the DNA binding region on DMP1 was mapped by deletion analysis. Initial N-terminal and C-terminal deletions indicated that the DNA binding region resides within the C-terminal region of the protein. Further deletions narrowed down the DNA binding region from 420 to 489 aa. Gene knock-out studies provide a powerful tool to investigate complex biological phenomena. DMP1 knock-out mice have been developed, and they demonstrate defects in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage mineralization resembling chondrodysplasia-like defects (25Ye L. MacDougall M. Zhang S. Xie Y. Zhang J. Li Z. Lu Y. Mishina Y. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19141-19148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). An interesting observation was that increased proliferation of chondrocytes indicates a time lapse in the differentiation of these cells into a mature mineral-forming tissue. With respect to DSPP expression, DMP1–/– mice showed a reduced level of expression compared with the wild-type mice (26Ye L. Mishina Y. Chen D. Huang H. Dallas S.L. Dallas M.R. Sivakumar P. Kunieda T. Tsutsui T.W. Boskey A. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6197-6203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This resulted in a hypo-mineralization phenotype and reduced thickness of dentin leading to a wider pre-dentin in DMP1 null mice (26Ye L. Mishina Y. Chen D. Huang H. Dallas S.L. Dallas M.R. Sivakumar P. Kunieda T. Tsutsui T.W. Boskey A. Bonewald L.F. Feng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6197-6203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, results obtained from our laboratory by overexpressing DMP1 in undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells induced their differentiation toward an odontoblast-like cell phenotype, with the transcription of the DSPP gene (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This response was found to be cell type-specific; that is, only mesenchymal-derived cells underwent this phenotypic change (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An extension of this study further demonstrated that DMP1 is localized in the nucleus (27Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that DMP1 regulates the expression of DSPP gene. However, during bio-mineralization, we have demonstrated that DMP1 is phosphorylated and transported to the extracellular matrix where it functions in hydroxyapatite crystal nucleation and assembly of the dentin matrix (23He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). DMP1 is one of the early genes expressed during the commitment of neural crest-derived cells into odontoblasts. Expression of DSPP follows DMP1 expression, indicating a probable control over regulation of the DSPP gene during early odontoblast differentiation events (31Valentin-Hansen P. Holst B. Josephsen J.

However, with their progression into the maturation stage of the odontoblasts, expression of DMP1 decreases while DSPP expression continues to increase (2Begue-Kirn C. Krebsbach P.H. Bartlett J.D.

The question that still needs to be addressed is the molecular control that DMP1 exerts over DSPP expression during the mineralization process. One possible explanation would be that DMP1 initiates the basal expression of DSPP during the early stages of odontoblast cytodifferentiation, whereas during the terminal differentiation process the expression of DSPP is independent of DMP1. Immunohistochemical analyses with DMP1-specific antibody on developing tooth sections in mouse have supported this hypothesis. Results demonstrate a high level of DMP1 expression at the earlier stages of odontoblast maturation (36Hao J. Zou B. Narayanan K. George A. Bone. 2004; 34: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 37Baba O. Qin C. Brunn J.C. Wygant J.N. McIntyre B.W. Butler W.T. Matrix Biol. 2004; 23: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, we do not have any substantial data to support the mechanism that operates to control the expression of DSPP during the secretory stage of the odontoblasts. A possible explanation could be the remodeling of chromatin structure during the odontoblast differentiation process. There are several reports indicating chromatin remodeling as a common mechanism that occurs during various stages of cellular differentiation (33Kosak S.T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 38Burke L.J. Baniahmad A. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1876-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 39McKinsey T.A.

DSPP null mice showed a similar phenotype as the DMP1 null mice at later stages of development (12Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). DSPP–/– mice had an extended pre-dentin area and possessed a reduced mineralized dentin region (12Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These results are in concurrence with our observations presented here in this report. DSPP promoter has been characterized to a certain extent. Several transcriptional binding sites and their effects on the transcriptional activity of DSPP promoter were studied in a cell-culture system and a transgenic mouse model (4Kornberg R.D. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: M46-M49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 5Sreenath T.L. Cho A. MacDougall M. Kulkarni A.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 509-516PubMed Google Scholar). The tight programmed regulation is believed to be achieved by the orchestrated manipulation performed by various transcription factors and signaling pathways. Runx2, an osteoblast-specific transcription factor, has been shown to differentially regulate the DSPP expression during the odontoblast differentiation and maturation process (8Thyagarajan T. Sreenath T. Cho A. Wright J.T. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11016-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Chen S. Gu T.T. Sreenath T. Kulkarni A.B. Karsenty G. MacDougall M. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 338-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Runx2 down-regulates the DSPP promoter activity in pre-odontoblasts, whereas it activates the DSPP promoter activity in differentiated odontoblasts. It is presumed that partners for Runx2 might play a role in this differential regulation of the DSPP promoter. Another target gene we have identified downstream of DMP1 is osteocalcin (data not shown). DMP1 regulates the osteocalcin promoter through a different mechanism. Overexpression of DMP1 in osteoblasts had no effect on the expression of the osteocalcin gene; however, overexpression of antisense DMP1 significantly decreased the expression level of the osteocalcin gene (24Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This result further suggests that other mechanisms might be operative through which DMP1 regulates the expression of bio-mineralization-specific genes. Future studies will focus on the detailed mechanism by which DMP1 mediates the regulation of such genes.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the chemokine CCL1, notably involved in cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory or allergic processes, constitutes a new molecular target for PAHs. Indeed, exposure to PAHs such as benzo[a]pyrene (BP) markedly increased mRNA expression and secretion of CCL1 in primary human macrophage cultures. Moreover, intranasal administration of BP to mice enhanced mRNA levels of TCA3, the mouse orthologue of CCL1, in lung. CCL1 induction in cultured human macrophages was fully prevented by targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) through chemical inhibition or small interfering RNA-mediated down-modulation of its expression. In addition, BP and the potent AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin were found to enhance activity of a CCL1 promoter sequence containing a consensus xenobiotic-responsive element known to specifically interact with AhR. Moreover, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin triggered AhR binding to this CCL1 promoter element as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In an attempt to further characterize the mechanism of CCL1 induction, we demonstrated that BP was able to induce an early and transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration in human macrophages. Inhibition of this calcium increase, using the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester or the calcium store-operated channel inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, fully blocked CCL1 up-regulation. Taken together, these results bring the first demonstration that PAHs induce expression of the chemokine CCL1 in an AhR- and calcium-dependent manner.

They are usually generated through the burning of fossil fuels or wood, and are notably found in diesel exhaust particles, cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled foods, and industrial waste by-products (1.Hattemer-Frey H.A. Travis C.C. Toxicol. Ind. Health. 1991; 7: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2.Knize M.G. Salmon C.P. Pais P. Felton J.S. Adv. Exp. Med.

These pollutants exert various major toxic effects toward human health, especially development of cancers and inflammatory diseases in various tissues (4.Sorensen M. Autrup H. Moller P. Hertel O. Jensen S.S. Vinzents P. Knudsen L.E. Loft S. Mutat. Res. 2003; 544: 255-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 5.Wogan G.N. Hecht S.S. Felton J.S. Conney A.H. Loeb L.A. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 473-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Immunotoxicity, including contact hypersensitivity, also constitutes a key hallmark of PAH exposure (6.Burchiel S.W. Luster M.I. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 98: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7.Klemme J.C. Mukhtar H. Elmets C.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6074-6078PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Anderson C. Hehr A.

Mutagen. 2003; 42: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This PAH pleiotropic toxicity has been linked, at least in part, to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. Indeed, PAHs bind to cytoplasmic AhR, thereby triggering its translocation into cell nucleus, its association with the AhR nuclear translocator, and its interaction with xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) (core sequence: GCGTG) found in the 5′-flanking regions of PAH-regulated genes (10.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). This usually leads to altered expression of target genes, which are presumed to contribute to PAH toxicity. Thus, CYP1A1, a drug-metabolizing enzyme required for the bioactivation of PAHs into reactive mutagenic electrophilic metabolites, is massively up-regulated in PAH-exposed cells in an AhR-dependent manner. Besides AhR activation, PAHs trigger elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in various cellular types, which has been hypothesized to contribute to their immunotoxic effects (11.Karras J.G. Conrad D.H. Holsapple M.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 75: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12.Krieger J.A. Born J.L. Burchiel S.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 127: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Moreover, CYP1A1 induction by AhR agonists has been shown to be abolished by inhibition of calcium movements, thus linking AhR target gene regulation with calcium changes (13.Le Ferrec E. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Rauch C. Bardiau C. Maheo K. Massiere F. Le Vee M. Guillouzo A. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24780-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Among genes regulated by PAHs, pro-inflammatory cytokines constitute an emerging class. Indeed, increased expressions of IL-1β, IL-8, or tumor necrosis factor-α occur in cells exposed to PAHs or to other potent AhR agonists such as TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), which may contribute to the adverse inflammatory or immunotoxic effects due to PAH exposure (14.Lecureur V.

To identify new cytokines regulated by PAHs, we have recently analyzed the transcriptome of BP-treated human macrophages using macroarrays. Data from these experiments suggest that CCL1 (CC-chemokine ligand 1, also named I-309), a chemokine triggering Th2 immune response and strongly implicated in cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and allergic inflammation (18.Haque N.S.

Blood. 2004; 103: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), may be up-regulated by AhR agonists. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that BP markedly induces CCL1 production in human macrophages by an AhR-dependent mechanism. Moreover, BP was shown to trigger an early and transient increase of intracellular calcium concentration, which seems essential to CCL1 up-regulation by this environmental contaminant. Reagents—PAHs, α-naphtoflavone (αNF), resveratrol, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TCDD was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA), and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM) was obtained from Calbiochem. Pluronic acid and Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Fura-2-AM) were provided from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and Ficoll was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (specific activity, 1.2 × 108 units/mg) was purchased from Schering Plough (Lyon, France). 3′-Methoxy-4′-nitroflavone (3′M4′NF) was a kind gift from Dr. T. Gasiewicz (Dept. of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY). Polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-AhR was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth, PA), and nonspecific IgG peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit was from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were commercial products of the highest purity available. Chemicals were commonly used as stock solution in Me2SO. The final concentration of solvent did not exceed 0.2% (v/v); control cultures received the same dose of solvent as for treated counterparts. Cell Culture—Primary human macrophages were obtained from blood monocytes as previously described (21.van Grevenynghe J. Rion S. Le Ferrec E. Le Vee M. Amiot L. Fauchet R. Fardel O. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2374-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, mononuclear cells, isolated from blood buffy coats (kindly provided by the Etablissement Français du Sang, Rennes, France) through Ficoll gradient centrifugation, were initially seeded at the density of 2 × 106 cells per cm2 into plastic culture plates for 2 h. Non-adherent cells were then removed, and adherent monocytes were further cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 6 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 400 units/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor. Such a protocol allows the obtainment of pure macrophage cultures with <1% of contaminating cells. Macrophages were then routinely cultured in the medium described above. Human endothelial EAhy-926 cells (22.Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. C. J. Edgell, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Animal Treatment—Male adult C57bl/6 mice (10 weeks old, weighing 25 g) were treated by intranasal instillation of 500 μg of BP dissolved in tricaprylin (50 μl/mouse) under etomidate anesthesia. Control mice received tricaprylin only. Twenty-four hours after BP treatment, mice were quickly anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) and underwent removal of lungs, which were stored at –80 °C until analysis. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNAs were extracted from cells or lungs using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). They were then subjected to semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or to reverse transcription-real-time quantitative-PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses as previously described (23.Laupeze B. Amiot L. Sparfel L. Le Ferrec E. Fauchet R. Fardel O. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24.Jigorel E. Le Vee M. Boursier-Neyret C. Bertrand M. Fardel O. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR assays, cDNA aliquots were amplified using Master mix (Promega) and 0.1 mm of forward and reverse gene primers listed in Table 1. Each PCR cycle consisted of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. β-Actin primers were used as an internal control. PCR products were finally visualized using ethidium bromide-staining agarose gels. RT-qPCR assays were performed using the fluorescent dye SYBR Green methodology and an ABI Prism 7000 detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Gene-specific primers (Table 1) were designed with the Primer3 software (available at frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/mrimer3/primer3_www.cgi). The specificity of each gene amplification was checked up at the end of qPCR reactions through the analysis of dissociation curves of the PCR products. Amplification curves were read with ABI Prism 7000 SDS software using the comparative cycle threshold method. Relative quantification of the steady-state target mRNA levels was performed after normalization of the total amount of cDNA tested to an 18 S RNA endogenous reference.TABLE 1Primer sequencesGenesPrimersForwardReverseRT-PCR CCL15′-GTTGCTTCTCATTTGCGGAG-3′5′-GGTGTAGGGCTGGTAGTTTGC-3′ CCL25′-CTGAAGCTCGCACTCTCGCC-3′5′-GGTGTCTGGGGAAAGCTAGG-3′ CCL55′-CCCCATATTCCTCGGACAC-3′5′-GTTGTTGTTGTTGTGACGG-3′ CCL225′-GAAGCTGGCTGTGGTAGCG-3′5′-CCTGGATGACACTGAGCTGG-3′ CYP1A15′-TCACAGACAGCCTGATTGAGC-3′5′-GATGGGTTGACCCATAGCTT-3′ IL-1β5′-GATGGCGGCATCCAGCTAGC-3′5′-CTTTCAACACGCAGGACAGG-3′ β-actin5′-GCCAGACAAGAGAG-3′5′-GGCCATCTCTTGCTGC-3′RT-qPCR CCL15′-AGGCCTCTTTGCCTCTCTTC-3′5′-ATGCAGATCATCACCACAGC-3′ TCA35′-GGATGTTGACAGCAAGAGCA-3′5′-TGGAGGACTGAGGGAAACTG-3′ 18 S5′-CGCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTC-3′5′-TTGGCAAATGCTTTCGCT-3′CHIP assay Primers spanning the XRE-28035′-TTGCCTGTGCTGGTCTGACT-3′5′-GTGGGATTGCTGGGTCAAAT-3′ Primers spanning the XRE-3125′-TGCTATTTGCATTTTGTGTGAATATG-3′5′-TCGTGGTGGTGATGGATTGA-3′ Open table in a new tab Determination of Cytokine Levels—Levels of CCL1 and IL-1β in the supernatants of macrophage cultures were quantified using Duoset ELISA development system kits obtained from R&D systems (Abington, UK). Briefly, 96-well plates, initially coated with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-human CCL1 or IL-1β antibody overnight at room temperature, were incubated for 2 h with macrophage culture supernatants or recombinant human CCL1 or IL-1β standard. After washes, plates were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reporter Gene Constructs and Luciferase Assays—The 2975-bp region of the CCL1 gene promoter (GenBank™ under accession number AC002482), spanning –3038 to –63, was obtained through PCR amplification and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic (Promega); the resulting plasmid construct was designed as pCCL1-FL(–2975). The pCCL1-FL.Mut(–2975) plasmid corresponds to the pCCL1-FL(–2975), with three mutations located at positions –312, –311, and –310 on the XRE consensus site located at –312 (consensus XRE-312: GCGTG; mutated XRE-312: GCCAA). The pCYP1A1-FL(–1639) construct containing a 1639-bp region (from –1566 to +73) of the human CYP1A1 gene upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene had been previously described (25.Morel Y. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26969-26976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from Dr. R. Barouki (INSERM U490, Paris, France). EAhy-926 cells cultured in 24-well plates were transiently co-transfected with one of the firefly luciferase promoter-containing plasmids described above and the Renilla luciferase-encoding pRL-TK vector (Promega), used as an internal control, according to the Lipofectamine™ 2000 method (Invitrogen). Briefly, 400 μl of transfection medium (Opti-MEM) containing 200 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid was added per well of confluent EAhy-926 cells along with 20 ng of the pRL-TK plasmid and 0.4 μl of Lipofectamine™ 2000. After a 24-h period, cells were exposed to PAHs for another 24-h period. Dual luciferase assays (firefly and Renilla) were then performed with a Promega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. pGL3 basic (a promoterless pGL3-luciferase construct) and pGL3 SV40 (a pGL3-luciferase construct with the SV40 promoter) vectors were used in parallel as negative and positive firefly luciferase controls, respectively. Design and Transfection of AhR-targeted Specific siRNA—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide sequences, designed as recommended (26.Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) with two 2′-deoxythymidine overhands on each strand, were: AhR siRNA (SiAhR), 5′-AAGUCGGUCUCUAUGCCGCTT-3′, and control AhR-mutated siRNA (SiAhRmut), 5′-AACUCGGUCUCUAUGCCGCTT-3′. The absence of matching of these sequences with that of any other human gene was checked by using the NCBI standard nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST program. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using the HiPerFect Transfection kit (Qiagen). Macrophages, cultured in 24-well plates, were incubated with the transfection mix containing 5 nm siRNA and 4.5 μl of HiPerFect reagent in 500 μl of culture medium, in agreement with the manufacturer's instructions. After a 40-h incubation, the transfection medium was removed, and cells were thereafter exposed to BP for an additional 8-h period. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed essentially as previously described (27.Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28.Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages either untreated or exposed to BP or TCDD for 30 min, were crossed-linked with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 10 min. After washing and suspension in cell lysis buffer, chromatin was digested using the BamH1 restriction enzyme at 37 °C overnight. Protein-DNA complexes were then immunoprecipitated using rabbit polyclonal antibody against AhR or nonspecific IgG anti-rabbit and protein G-Sepharose as described by Corre et al. (29.Corre S.

The recovered DNA was then subjected to PCR using primers listed in Table 1 and covering XRE sequences found in CCL1 and CYP1A1 promoter (positive control) (30.Hestermann E.V. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7920-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or an XRE-free sequence of the tyrosinase gene (negative control) (29.Corre S. Primot A. Sviderskaya E. Bennett D.C. Vaulont S. Goding C.R. Galibert M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51226-51233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were isolated from cultured macrophages using the BD™ Transfactor extraction kit (BD Biosciences). Binding of nuclear extracts to [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides was then analyzed with the Promega gel shift assay system (Promega). Two double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to (–326 to –294) region of the CCL1 promoter were used: the wild-type CCL1–312-WT (5′-ATCTTGAAAAAGTGCGTGGGAACTGTCCTGGT-3′) (underlined characters represent the core XRE) and the mutated CCL1–312-Mut (5′-ATCTTGAAAAAGTGCCAAGGAACTGTCCTGGT-3′). DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Variations in intracellular concentrations of calcium were analyzed by microspectrofluorometry using the Ca2+-sensitive probe Fura-2-AM as previously reported (13.Le Ferrec E. Lagadic-Gossmann D. Rauch C. Bardiau C. Maheo K. Massiere F. Le Vee M. Guillouzo A. Morel F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24780-24787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were incubated at 37 °C in cell suspension buffer (134.8 mm NaCl; 4.7 mm KCl; 1.2 mm K2HPO4; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm CaCl2; 10 mm glucose; 10 mm HEPES; pH 7.4) supplemented with 1.5 μm Fura-2-AM and 0.006% pluronic acid. Following probe loading, cells, placed in a continuously perfused recording chamber mounted on the stage of an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Diaphot), were irradiated alternately with 340 and 380 nm light, and fluorescence from the trapped dye was measured at 510 nm. The ratio of fluorescence intensities recorded after excitation at 340 nm (F340) and at 380 nm (F380) was used to estimate intracellular concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The monochromator and the photometers, which allow emission and detection of fluorescence from ∼3 to 5 cells in the field of view, were part of a DeltaRAM system from Photon Technology International (PTI, Birmingham, UK), which also provided software systems to acquire and process data. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Significant differences were routinely evaluated with the non-parametric Wilcoxon test except for the variations of intracellular calcium concentration for which the Mann-Whitney U test was used. The level of significance was p < 0.05. Effect of BP on CCL1 Expression and Production in Human Macrophages and on TCA3 Expression in Mouse Lung—CCL1-chemokine expression was investigated in primary human macrophages exposed to various BP concentrations (from 0.1 to 20 μm) for 24 h (Fig. 1A). As for CYP1A1, used here as positive control of treatment, the BP effect on CCL1 mRNA levels was dose-dependent: CCL1 mRNA up-regulation was detected after 0.1 μm BP, reaching a maximum after 10 μm BP. Such data, obtained with semiquantitative RT-PCR assays, were fully confirmed using RT-qPCR analyses, which revealed a 3.9 ± 2.2-, 12.6 ± 6.6-, and 27.9 ± 9.9-fold induction of CCL1 mRNA levels in response to 0.1, 1, and 10 μm BP treatment, respectively (n = 4). CCL1 secretion in supernatants of macrophagic cultures was concomitantly enhanced by BP in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by ELISA measurements, reaching a value of 12.8 ± 3.4 ng/ml in the supernatant of cultures exposed to 10 μm BP (Fig. 1A). Kinetic analysis of CCL1 gene induction by BP showed a maximum rate of mRNA level at 12–24 h, as for CYP1A1 up-regulation and a maximum of CCL1 secretion from 24-h exposure (Fig. 1B). Using shorter BP treatment time, CCL1 mRNA induction was detected as soon as 90-min exposure to BP (data not shown). Alveolar macrophages are the main cellular source of CCL1 in the lung (31.Bishop B. Lloyd C.M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4810-4817Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To determine whether in vivo BP treatment could also be effective on CCL1 levels, the expression of TCA3, the mouse CCL1 orthologue gene (32.Goya I. Gutierrez J. Varona R. Kremer L. Zaballos A. Marquez G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1975-1981PubMed Google Scholar), was determined using RT-qPCR assays. For this purpose, mice were treated by intranasal instillation of BP. As shown in Fig. 1C, BP exposure increased TCA3 mRNA levels in lung tissue (mean induction of 3.9-fold). Induction of lung CYP1A1 used as a validity control of mice BP treatment was concomitantly observed (data not shown) (33.Ma Q. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Lack of Contribution of IL-1β to BP-mediated CCL1 Up-regulation—IL-1β has been previously identified as a PAH target (34.Tamaki A. Hayashi H. Nakajima H. Takii T. Katagiri D. Miyazawa K. Hirose K. Onozaki K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and it was consequently found to be up-regulated at both mRNA and protein level in BP-exposed macrophagic cultures (Fig. 2A). Because CCL1 secretion has been shown to be triggered by IL-1β (35.Selvan R.S. Zhou L.J. Krangel M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it was therefore tempting to speculate that up-regulation of CCL1 expression in BP-treated macrophages might have been a consequence of primary induction of IL-1β. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of IL1-RA, an antagonist of IL-1 receptor (36.Arend W.P. Gabay C. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), on BP-mediated induction of CCL1. IL1-RA, used at doses (50 and 100 ng/ml) that fully abolished IL-1β-mediated CCL1 mRNA up-regulation (Fig. 2B), failed to counteract CCL1 induction in BP-exposed macrophages (Fig. 2C), making a direct contribution of IL-1β to CCL1 regulation by BP very unlikely. Effects of AhR Agonists and/or Antagonists and of AhR Knockdown on CCL1 Up-regulation—We analyzed the effects of hydrocarbons such as benzo[e]pyrene (BeP) and TCDD, known as very weak and potent activators of AhR, respectively (37.Sterling K. Raha A. Bresnick E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1994; 128: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38.Mandal P.K. J. Comp. Physiol. [B]. 2005; 175: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), on CCL1 expression levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, 10 μm BeP failed to significantly increase CCL1 mRNA level and CCL1 secretion in macrophage cultures; by contrast, 10 nm TCDD markedly enhanced CCL1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, similarly to BP. We next investigated the effects of 3′M4′NF, a potent antagonist of AhR (39.Nazarenko D.A. Dertinger S.D. Gasiewicz T.A. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 61: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40.Lu Y.F. Santostefano M. Cunningham B.D. Threadgill M.D. Safe S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), on BP-triggered induction of CCL1. As shown in Fig. 3B, 3′M4′NF, used either at 1 or 5 μm, markedly counteracted the up-regulation of CCL1 mRNA and secretion in BP-exposed macrophagic cell cultures. It concomitantly blocked induction of the AhR-regulated gene CYP1A1 at mRNA levels, fully confirming that 3′M4′NF was active under our experimental conditions. Similar inhibition of BP-mediated up-regulation of CCL1 expression was obtained using resveratrol or αNF as AhR antagonists instead of 3′M4′NF (data not shown). Besides pharmacological AhR inhibition, we analyzed whether AhR knockdown, using specific AhR-targeted siRNAs, may impair CCL1 induction in response to PAHs. Transfection of SiAhR allowed a strong reduction of AhR mRNA and AhR protein levels in primary macrophages (data not shown) and, as expected, CYP1A1 induction by BP was also prevented by transfection of SiAhR (Fig. 3C). Similarly, AhR knocking down markedly counteracted the inducing effects of BP toward CCL1 mRNA levels in macrophagic cultures when compared with transfection of control siRNA (SiAhR-mut) (Fig. 3C). Effects of AhR Agonists and/or Antagonists on CCL1 Promoter Activity—We next studied the effects of BP, BeP, TCDD, and/or 3′M4′NF on CCL1 promoter activity. For these experiments, we performed transient transfection assays in EAhy-926 cells with the pCCL1-FL(–2975) reporter vector. This construct contained 2975 bp of the CCL1 gene 5′-flanking region. As shown in Fig. 4A, potent AhR agonists as BP and TCDD significantly enhanced luciferase activity of pCCL1-FL(–2975), unlike the very weak AhR activator BeP. Similar effects were observed with the pCYP1A1-FL(–1639) plasmid, a CYP1A1 promoter construct used here as positive control. Moreover, the AhR antagonist 3′M4′NF was able to abrogate the increase of CCL1 and CYP1A1 promoter activity due to TCDD (Fig. 4B). Direct AhR Interaction with CCL1 Promoter in BP- or TCDD-treated Macrophages—Analysis of the CCL1 promoter sequence indicated the presence of two AhR-related consensus XRE located at –2803 (XRE-2803) and –312 (XRE-312) (Fig. 5A), in agreement with a previous report (41.Sun Y.V. Boverhof D.R. Burgoon L.D. Fielden M.R. Zacharewski T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4512-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To investigate whether AhR interacts in vivo with these consensus XREs, we performed a ChIP assay using either untreated or"

However, the mechanism of this cross-talk remains unknown. An immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule nectin first trans-interacts with each other to form cell-cell adhesion and induces activation of Rap1, Cdc42, and Rac small G proteins through c-Src. Trans-interacting nectin then recruits another cell-cell adhesion molecule cadherin to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and forms adherens junctions (AJs). Here, we show that integrin αvβ3 functionally and physically associates with nectin. Integrin αvβ3 colocalized with nectin at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites. The association of integrin αvβ3 with nectin was direct and was mediated through their extracellular regions. This interaction was necessary for the nectin-induced signaling. Focal adhesion kinase, which relays the integrin-initiated outside-in signals to the intracellular signaling molecules, was also involved in the nectin-induced signaling. During the formation of AJs, the high affinity form of integrin αvβ3 co-localized with nectin at the primordial cell-cell contact sites, and then after the establishment of AJs, this high affinity form of integrin αvβ3 was converted to the low affinity form, which continued to co-localize with nectin. Thus, integrin αvβ3 and nectin play pivotal roles in the cross-talk between cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions and the formation of cadherin-based AJs. Cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions cross-talk together, and these two junctions cooperatively regulate cell movement, proliferation, adhesion, and polarization.

Thus, integrin αvβ3 and nectin play pivotal roles in the cross-talk between cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions and the formation of cadherin-based AJs. There is cross-talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions in epithelial cells and non-epithelial cells (1Pignatelli M. J. Pathol. 1998; 186: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Siu M.K. Cheng C.Y. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The major cell-cell junctions are adherens junctions (AJs) 2The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; TJ, tight junction; ECM, extracellular matrix; Necl, nectin-like molecule; Nef, the extracellular fragment of nectin fused to the Fc portion of IgG; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HEK cell, human embryonic kidney cell; MDCK cell, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST-PAK-CRIB, glutathione S-transferase-PAK-Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region. 2The abbreviations used are: AJ, adherens junction; TJ, tight junction; ECM, extracellular matrix; Necl, nectin-like molecule; Nef, the extracellular fragment of nectin fused to the Fc portion of IgG; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; FRNK, FAK-related non-kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HEK cell, human embryonic kidney cell; MDCK cell, Madin-Darby canine kidney cell; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GST-PAK-CRIB, glutathione S-transferase-PAK-Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region. and tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial cells and AJs in non-epithelial cells. Cadherin and claudin are key cell-cell adhesion molecules at AJs and TJs, respectively (3Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tsukita S. Furuse M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The cell-matrix junctions are formed by the interaction of integrin with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin (5Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 6Jin H. Varner J. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 90: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The integrin-mediated cell-matrix junctions positively or negatively regulate the formation and stability of cell-cell junctions through protein kinases associated with integrins, such as focal adhesion kinease (FAK) and c-Src (5Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R. Yamada K.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 7Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). For instance, this regulation may be important for the epithelialmesenchymal transition of epithelial cells in both physiological and pathological states (8Monier-Gavelle F. Duband J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Schreider C. Peignon G. Thenet S. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 543-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the embryonic development, integrin promotes epithelial cell remodeling, which appears to be related to reduced interaction of cell-cell adhesion molecules at AJs with the cytoskeleton (8Monier-Gavelle F. Duband J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In a colon cancer cell line, the attachment of integrin to ECM proteins induces functional polarization of the cells and reinforces the E-cadherin-based AJs (9Schreider C. Peignon G. Thenet S. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 543-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the integrin-induced signaling molecules, FAK and paxillin, have been shown to regulate the N-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion in HeLa cells (10Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kurokawa K. Hanks S.K. Matsuda M. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These data may explain the importance of the cross-talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions for the development of embryo and the metastasis of cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms for the cross-talk between cell-cell and cellmatrix junctions have not fully been understood. Nectin is an emerging immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecule at AJs and constitutes a family that consists of four members (nectin-1, nectin-2, nectin-3, and nectin-4) (11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nectin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through afadin, a nectin- and F-actin-binding protein, as cadherin is associated with the actin cytoskeleton through many peripheral membrane proteins, including α- and β-catenins (3Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nectin forms homo-cis-dimers followed by formation of homo- or hetero-trans dimers (trans-interaction) in a Ca2+-independent manner, although cadherin forms homo-cis-dimers followed by formation of only homo-trans-dimers (trans-interaction) in a Ca2+-dependent manner (3Takeichi M. Development. 1988; 102: 639-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Nectin first forms cell-cell adhesion and induces activation of Rap1, Cdc42, and Rac small G proteins through c-Src (13Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Rap1 then binds to afadin, which then binds to p120ctn associated with non-trans-interacting cadherin (18Hoshino T. Sakisaka T. Baba T. Yamada T. Kimura T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24095-24103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This Rap1-dependent binding of afadin to p120ctn inhibits the endocytosis of non-trans-interacting cadherin and enhances the accumulation of non-trans-interacting cadherin at the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites and the cell-cell adhesion activity of cadherin, eventually resulting in the formation of AJs (18Hoshino T.

Okamoto R. Irie K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5288-5299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc42 activated in this way increases the number of filopodia and cell-cell adhesion sites, whereas activated Rac induces the formation of lamellipodia and efficiently seals the cell-cell contacts between filopodia-like a zipper (11Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 12Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Thus, the trans-interaction of nectin induces the formation of AJs in a complex mechanism. We have recently found that nectin-like molecule (Necl)-5/Tage-4/PVR/CD155 associates with integrin αvβ3 and enhances cell movement and proliferation (20Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T.

However, upon cell-cell contacts Necl-5 heterophilically trans-interacts with nectin-3 to initiate the formation of cell-cell junctions (22Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Itoh S. Shingai T. Takekuni K. Satoh K.

Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, this trans-interaction of Necl-5 with nectin-3 induces down-regulation of Necl-5 from the cell surface by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (25Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Necl-5 causes reduction of cell movement and proliferation. Cultured cells continue to move and proliferate until they become confluent. When cultured cells become confluent, they form cell-cell adhesion and gradually reduce and finally stop their movement and proliferation (26Abercrombie M. Heaysman J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1953; 5: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27Fisher H.W. Yeh J. Science. 1967; 155: 581-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is known for a long time as contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation. However, the molecular mechanism for this phenomenon has not fully been elucidated. We have proposed that the cell-cell contact-induced trans-interaction of Necl-5 with nectin-3 and the subsequent down-regulation of Necl-5 are at least one mechanism underlying the contact inhibition of cell movement and proliferation (25Fujito T. Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Minami Y. Kajita M. Sakamoto Y. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Extending these earlier observations and gaining more insights into the cross-talk between the cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions, we examined here the relationship between nectin and integrin αvβ3 and its involvement in both the nectin-induced signaling and the formation of AJs. Vector Construction, Protein Purification, and Reagents—The following expression vectors were kindly provided; wild-type human integrin αv, integrin α5, integrin β1, and integrin β3 (pcDNA3-αv, pcDNA3-α5, pcDNA3-β1, and pcDNA3-β3, respectively) were from Dr. J. C. Norman (University of Leicester, Leicester, UK), constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of human integrin β3 (pcDNA3.1-Myc-His(+)-β3N305T and pcDNA3.1-Myc-His(+)-β3T329C/A347C, respectively) were from Dr. J.

Akagi (Osaka Bioscience Institute, Suita, Japan), and FLAG-claudin-1 (pCCL-1F) was from Dr. M. Furuse (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Expression vectors for FLAG-nectin-1 (amino acids 27-518, pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-1), FLAG-nectin-2 (amino acids 30-467, pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-2), FLAG-nectin-3 (amino acids 56-549, pCAGIPuro-FLAG-nectin-3), Myc-nectin-3 (amino acids 56-549, pCAGIPuro-Myc-nectin-3), FLAG-nectin-4 (amino acids 29-508, pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-4), FLAG-nectin-3-ΔCP (amino acids 56-430, pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-3-ΔCP), and FLAG-nectin-3-ΔEC (amino acids 395-549, pFLAG-CMV1-nectin-3-ΔEC) were constructed by inserting each nectin cDNA fragment into pFLAG-CMV1 (Sigma), pCA-GIPuro-FLAG, or pCAGIPuro-Myc vector. Expression vectors for GFP-E-cadherin and GFP-N-cadherin were also constructed by inserting full-length mouse E-cadherin and N-cadherin into pCAGGS-GFP and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) vectors, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase-PAK-Cdc42/Rac interactive binding region (GST-PAK-CRIB) fusion protein and the extracellular regions of nectin-1, nectin-2, and nectin-3 fused to human IgG Fc (Nef-1, Nef-2, and Nef-3, respectively) were also prepared as described (13Kawakatsu T.

Echistatin, flavoridin, cyclo-RGDfV, and FITC-phalloidin were purchased from Sigma. Cell Lines and Transfection—Wild-type NIH3T3 cells and NIH3T3 cells stably expressing nectin-1 (nectin-1-NIH3T3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. To obtain nectin-1-NIH3T3 cells, we referred to the same protocol as described (21Kakunaga S. Ikeda W. Shingai T. Fujito T. Yamada A. Minami Y. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36419-36425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, a full-length mouse nectin-1α cDNA was inserted into an expression vector pMSCVhyg (Clontech). A construct of pMSCVhyg-nectin-1α was co-transfected with a packing vector pCL-Eco (Imgenex) into HEK293 cells and converted to retrovirus. Then NIH3T3 cells were infected with retrovirus and selected by 250 μg/ml hygromycin. For DNA transfection, Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or Nucleofection system (Amaxa) was applied following the manufacturer's instruction. HEK293 cells, MDCK cells, and MDCK cells stably expressing nectin-1 (nectin-1-MDCK cells) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Antibodies—The rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) against nectin-3 was prepared as described (29Satoh-Horikawa K. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Miyahara M. Nishimura M. Tachibana K. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J.

Shattil (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and Dr. M. Takeichi (RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology, Kobe, Japan), respectively. Hybridoma cells expressing a mouse anti-Myc mAb (9E10) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and prepared as described (32Kodama A. Takaishi K. Nakano K. Nishioka H. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3996-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The hamster anti-integrin β3 mAb and the non-immunized hamster IgG for flow cytometric analysis were purchased from Pharmingen and Jackson ImmunoResearch, respectively. The following rabbit pAbs were purchased from commercial sources; anti-N-cadherin (Takara), anti-integrin αv (Chemicon and Pharmingen), anti-integrin β3 (Chemicon and Pharmingen), anti-claudin-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-GFP (MBL), anti-Src (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) (Cell Signaling Technology) Abs. The mouse mAbs listed below were also purchased from commercial sources; anti-N-cadherin (Pharmingen), anti-integrin αvβ3 (LM609; Chemicon), anti-integrin αv (Pharmingen), anti-integrin α5 (Pharmingen), anti-integrin β1 (Pierce), anti-Cdc42 (Pharmingen), anti-Rac1 (Upstate), anti-FAK (Pharmingen), anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr397) (Pharmingen), anti-actin (Chemicon), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-HA (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.) Abs. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and fluorophore-labeled secondary Abs were obtained from Chemicon and Molecular Probes, respectively. Assays for Cell Spreading and Bead-Cell Contact—The formation of cell spreading was assayed as described (13Kawakatsu T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Fukuhara T. Hoshino T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50749-50755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For inhibition of the activity of integrin αvβ3, the cells were treated with 0.37 μm echistatin or 10 nm flavoridin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone as a control for 2 h before the trypsin-EDTA treatment and during the culture on the Nef-1- or IgG-coated coverslips. The bead-cell contact was assayed as described (28Honda T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Yasumi M. Shingai T. Fukuhara A. Ozaki-Kuroda K. Irie K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells were seeded on the laminin-coated coverslips, cultured for 3 h, and then incubated with latex-sulfate microbeads coated with Nef-1 or IgG as a control for 1 h. After the incubation, the cells were fixed and immunostained followed by observation by use of Radian 2100 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation Assay—HEK293 cells expressing in various combinations of the indicated molecules were lysed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and then the supernatant was incubated with the anti-FLAG mAb or the anti-GFP pAb at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling with the SDS sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated Abs. To investigate the association of endogenous integrin αvβ3 with endogenous nectin-3, NIH3T3 cells were lysed with buffer A, and the cell lysates were incubated with the anti-nectin-3 mAb or control rat IgG as a control followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose precoated with the goat anti-rat IgG. The immunoprecipitated samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. For the treatment with EDTA, which abrogates the ligand binding capability of integrin (33Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), HEK293 cells were incubated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS containing 5 mm EDTA for 30 min before the cell lysis. To quantify the cell surface expression of each nectin, we labeled cell surface proteins including nectins with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-ss-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. After the cell lysis, biotinylated nectins were collected by incubation with streptavidin-coated beads (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by the anti-FLAG mAb. In Vitro Binding of Nectin-3 with Integrin αvβ3—To obtain the recombinant protein of the extracellular region of human integrin αvβ3 heterodimer (integrin αvβ3-EC), αvβ3-EC-Chinese hamster ovary lec 3.2.8.1 cells expressing the extracellular region of human integrin αvβ3 were cultured, and the culture supernatant containing soluble integrin αvβ3-EC was collected (34Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The culture supernatant was applied to nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0). After the beads were extensively washed with buffer B and then buffer B containing 0.6 m NaCl, the bound integrin αvβ3-EC was eluted with elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2,1mm MgCl2, and 500 mm imidazole at pH 8.0), and the eluate was dialyzed with buffer B without imidazole. The protein concentration of integrin αvβ3-EC was determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein on SDS-PAGE. To examine the binding of Nef-3 and integrin αvβ3-EC, integrin αvβ3-EC (6 pmol) was immobilized on nickel-Sepharose beads, and Nef-3 (60 pmol) was incubated with the integrin αvβ3-EC-immobilized nickel-Sepharose beads or nickel-Sepharose beads alone in 0.3 ml of buffer B containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After the beads were extensively washed with buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer. The eluate was then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The bound Nef-3 was determined by the anti-human IgG Fc pAb conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (American Qualex). Assays for c-Src, Cdc42, and Rac Activities—The assay for c-Src activity was performed as described (15Fukuhara T. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Minami Y. Honda T. Hoshino T. Yamada T. Ogita H. Okada M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, nectin-1-NIH3T3 cells transiently expressing c-Src were cultured in the presence or absence of 0.37 μm echistatin followed by the incubation with Nef-3- or IgG-coated protein A-bound magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) for 30 min. For the examination of the inhibitory effect of FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) on c-Src activity, nectin-1-NIH3T3 cells transiently co-expressing c-Src with HA-FRNK or an empty vector as a control were incubated with Nef-3-coated protein A-bound magnetic beads for 30 min. After the incubation the beads were collected and used for analysis of c-Src activity by Western blotting with the anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) pAb. For the analysis of the activity of Cdc42 and Rac, the pull-down assay was performed as described (16Fukuyama T. Ogita H. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Yamada T. Sato T. Shimizu K. Nakamura T. Matsuda M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells removed from the dish were separated into two groups; one was replated on a 60-mm dish coated with 25 μg of Nef-1 to attach the cells to the substratum, and the other was kept cultured in suspension during the treatment with 25 μg of Nef-1 pre-clustered using the anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antiserum (Sigma) to avoid activation of any integrins by contact with the ECM. For the assessment of the effect of integrin αvβ3 on the activation of c-Src, Cdc42, and Rac, the cells were treated with 0.37 μm echistatin or 10 nm flavoridin for 2 h before stimulation of 25 μg of Nef-1 or IgG as a control for 30 min. These cells were then lysed, and the cell lysates were incubated with GST-PAK-CRIB on ice for 30 min followed by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 2 °C for 1 h. Proteins bound to the beads were used for analysis of the activity of Cdc42 and Rac by Western blotting. Wound Healing Assay—As described previously (20Ikeda W. Kakunaga S. Takekuni K. Shingai T. Satoh K. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Imai T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18015-18025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), confluent NIH3T3 cell monolayers were manually scratched with a 26-guage needle and subjected to the wound healing assay. The cells were fixed at the indicated time points after the wound procedure, immunostained with the indicated Abs, and observed by a confocal microscope. Assay for Formation of AJs—Cell-cell junctions of MDCK cells were assayed as described (35Fukuhara A. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51885-51893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. After culture, the cells were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM containing 2 mm Ca2+ for1h. The medium was replaced by DMEM with 5 mm EGTA to reduce the final concentration of Ca2+ at 2 μm, and then the cells were incubated for 2 h. The cells were then washed with DMEM and re-cultured in DMEM containing 2 mm Ca2+ with or without 0.37 μm echistatin, 10 nm flavoridin, or 10 μg/ml LM609 mAb for 2 h. The cells were fixed, immunostained with the anti-E-cadherin and anti-afadin Abs, and observed with a confocal microscope. The formation of AJ was defined as the cell-cell junction with the well stained for E-cadherin. siRNA Experiments—To knock down integrin β3 and FAK, double-stranded 25-nucleotide RNA duplexes (Stealth™ RNA-mediated interference; Invitrogen) for integrin β3 (5′-AAUCUGACGACACAGUCAUCCUCGU-3′) and FAK (5′-AAGUCAGCCAUAUUCUCGGCGAUGG-3′) were transfected into NIH3T3 cells and MDCK cells, respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent to conduct the cell spreading assay. An RNA duplex for luciferase (5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′), which sequence has no significant homology to any mammalian gene, was used as a control for siRNA experiments. The knockdown of each protein was confirmed by flow cytometry or Western blotting. Co-localization of Integrin αvβ3 with Nectin at AJs—In moving NIH3T3 cells, which do not contact with other cells, integrin αvβ3 co-localizes with Necl-5 at the leading edges (20Ikeda W. Kakunaga S.

Stable E3 integration is mediated by an accessory E3-binding protein (E3BP) located on each of the 12 E2 icosahedral faces. Here, we present evidence for a novel subunit organization in which E3 and E3BP form subcomplexes with a 1:2 stoichiometry implying the existence of a network of E3 “cross-bridges” linking pairs of E3BPs across the surface of the E2 core assembly. We have also determined a low resolution structure for a truncated E3BP/E3 subcomplex using small angle x-ray scattering showing one of the E3BP lipoyl domains docked into the E3 active site. This new level of architectural complexity in mammalian PDC contrasts with the recently published crystal structure of human E3 complexed with its cognate subunit binding domain and provides important new insights into subunit organization, its catalytic mechanism and regulation by the intrinsic PDC kinase.

Many enzymes associate permanently or transiently into large, multifunctional complexes. The evolution of these multienzyme assemblies allows for substrate channeling and active site coupling: sequential catalytic reactions proceed through the rapid transfer of intermediates between individual components and without diffusion into the bulk medium. The mitochondrial 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes are such a family of high molecular mass (4-10 MDa) multienzyme assemblies that serve as models for the study of protein-protein interactions and molecular recognition phenomena. They catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of a vital group of 2-oxoacid intermediates in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Principal members include the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC), 3The abbreviations used are: PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E1, pyruvate decarboxylase; E2, dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase; E3, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; PDK, PDC kinase; PDP, PDC phosphatase; h, human; LD, lipoyl domain; SBD, subunit binding domain; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; SV, sedimentation velocity; SE, sedimentation equilibrium. 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes. PDC is responsible for overall glucose homeostasis in mammals since it controls the key committed step in carbohydrate utilization, namely the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and NADH, linking glycolysis to the citric acid cycle. In recent years, genetic and physiological defects in PDC have been implicated in a wide range of diseases including various types of metabolic acidosis and mitochondrial myopathies (1Aral B. Benelli C. Ait-Ghezala G. Amessou M. Fouque F. Maunoury C. Creau N. Kamoun P. Marsac C. Am. J. Hum.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13413-13418Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PDC consists of multiple copies of three different enzymes: pyruvate decarboxylase (E1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). A fourth protein, E3-binding protein (E3BP, protein X) is present in many eukaryotic complexes but has no known enzymatic function. PDC is regulated by a tightly bound kinase (PDC kinase (PDK)) and a loosely bound phosphatase (PDP). These act in concert to exercise acute control of its activity state (phosphorylated E1 is inactive (8Ling M.F. McEachern G. Seyda A. MacKay N. Scherer S.W. Bratinova S. Beatty B. Giovannucci-Uzielli M.L. Robinson B.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)), thereby precisely regulating the flux of 2-carbon units entering the citric acid cycle. PDK is a major drug target since activation of PDC by limiting its phosphorylation has considerable potential for alleviating symptoms associated with impaired carbohydrate metabolism in severe diabetes. The icosahedral core of mammalian PDC comprises 60 E2 enzymes and 12 copies of an E2-related protein, E3BP (9Sanderson S.J. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Basic trimeric units of E2 form the 20 vertices of the icosahedron with E3BP bound in each of the 12 faces (10Zhou Z.H. McCarthy D.B. O'Connor C.M. Reed L.J. Stoops J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14802-14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Both E2 and E3BP have a similar, modular domain structure: human (h) E2 and E3BP consist of two (E2) or one (E3BP) N-terminal lipoyl domain(s) (LD) of ≈80 amino acids. Each lipoyl domain carries a lipoic acid moiety covalently linked to a lysine residue situated at the tip of a type I β-turn. The lipoyl domain is followed by a subunit binding domain (SBD) of ≈35 residues and a C-terminal domain of ≈250 residues that is essential for core formation. In E2 the C-terminal domain is also the catalytic domain, while the active site is absent from E3BP rendering it incapable of catalyzing the acetyltransferase reaction. All domains are interconnected by Ala- and Pro-rich linker regions of ≈30 amino acids in length that impart the flexibility necessary for the lipoyl domains to visit all three active sites during catalysis. In eukaryotes the E2:E3BP core of PDC provides the structural and mechanistic framework for the tight but non-covalent association of the heterotetrameric E1 and homodimeric E3 enzymes. The stability and overall subunit organization of the complex are governed by specific and tight protein-protein interactions between E2-SBD and E1 and E3BP-SBD and E3, respectively. However, PDCs from Gram-positive bacteria also have icosahedral cores but lack E3BP. Consequently, E1 and E3 have to compete for overlapping binding sites on E2; interaction of E2 with either E1 or E3 prevents complex formation with the other (11Lessard I.A. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PDC-deficient patients who are totally lacking the E3BP subunit possess partial complex activity (10-20% of controls) (8Ling M.F. McEachern G. Seyda A. MacKay N. Scherer S.W. Bratinova S. Beatty B. Giovannucci-Uzielli M.L. Robinson B.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), apparently because the SBD of E2 has retained a limited ability to mediate low affinity E3 binding. In Bacillus stearothermophilus PDC, E1 and E3 both bind to the SBD of E2 with 1:1 ratios (11Lessard I.A. Perham R.N. Biochem.

B. stearothermophilus E3/E2-SBD and E1/E2-SBD crystal structures show unequivocally that association of a second E2-SBD to E1 or E3 is impossible. In the case of E1 the binding site for E2-SBD is located across the 2-fold axis (16Frank R.A.W. Pratap J. Pei X.Y. Perham R.N. Luisi B.F. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1119-1130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas the binding site on E3 is close to the 2-fold axis of symmetry (17Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Occupation of both binding sites on E3 would result in steric clashes in one of the loop regions (17Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W.G. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A similar arrangement in the crystal structure of human (h) E3 bound to E3BP-SBD has been reported very recently (18Ciszak E.M. Makal A. Hong Y.S. Vettaikkorumakankauv A.K. Korochkina L.G. Patel M.S.

Intriguingly, however, the reported ratios for each of the constituent enzymes of mammalian PDC suggest the possibility of formation of 2:1 stoichiometric subcomplexes in this case. Thus, at maximal occupancy, 30 E1 molecules can associate with the 60-meric E2 core while 12 E3BP molecules associate with 6 E3 dimers (9Sanderson S.J. Miller C. Lindsay J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overexpressed hE3BP forms large aggregates and is unsuited to biophysical studies. Instead, we investigated the interaction of E3 with two different E3BP constructs consisting of the LD and/or SBD(s) (X di-domain (XDD) and X subunit binding domain (XSBD), respectively). A range of biochemical and biophysical approaches including native PAGE, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) were used to show cross-bridge formation of hE3 with its cognate SBD in solution. A low resolution structure for this subcomplex was obtained by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Plasmid Construction—The construction of vectors used for the overexpression of N-terminally His-tagged human E3 and truncated versions of E3BP will be described elsewhere. Briefly, full-length hE3 and residues 59-216 of mature hE3BP were cloned into pET14b (Novagen). Residues 166-230 of hE3BP were cloned into pET30a (Novagen). The E3BP constructs comprise either both the lipoyl and subunit binding domains or the SBD on its own and are referred to as the XDD or XSBD, respectively, throughout. Recombinant Proteins—E3, XSBD, and XDD were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS (Stratagene). Cells were grown in LB to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3-5 h at 30 °C. At induction, lipoic acid to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml was added to XDD cultures to maximize lipoylation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,300 × g for 10 min and lysed in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using the Bugbuster® kit (Novagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Insoluble cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,300 × g for 15 min. All proteins were purified using immobilized Zn2+-chelate chromatography on a BioCAD 700E work station (Applied Biosystems). A 20MC column was preloaded with 0.1 m ZnCl2 and equilibrated using binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Bound protein was washed with binding buffer and eluted in a linear 10-500 mm gradient of imidazole in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. E3 was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. DNA contamination of XSBD and XDD preparations was removed using HQ anion exchange chromatography. XSBD and XDD were buffer exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, loaded onto the column and following an extensive wash step eluted in a linear 0-1 m NaCl gradient. The final step of XSBD and XDD purification was gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100 (XSBD) and S-300 (XDD) columns (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, in 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. XDD/E3 complex was reconstituted from the purified proteins at a stoichiometric ratio of 3:1 (XDD:E3) using a final size exclusion step on Sephacryl-S300 in 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to remove unbound XDD. The protein concentrations of XSBD and XDD were determined using their calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 9,800 and 11,380 m-1, respectively. E3 was quantitated using FAD absorbance at 450 nm (ϵ = 22,600 m-1). Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Mixtures of XSBD:E3 at ratios from 4:1 to 1:3, and XDD:E3 from 10:1 to 1:3, were prepared, keeping the amount of E3 used constant at 160 pmol. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, and 5-10 μg of protein were loaded onto Tris-glycine gels (5% stacking, 8% resolving gel) and subjected to native PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were conducted at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Palo Alto, CA) using an An-60 Ti rotor. A rotor speed of 45,000 rpm was selected, and interference optics scans were collected every minute until sedimentation was complete. The concentration of E3 in the XDD:E3 mixtures was fixed at 4.9 μm. The XDD concentrations were adjusted to achieve XDD:E3 ratios of 4:1 to 1:3. Samples (380 μl) were loaded into 12-mm charcoal-filled epon double sector centerpieces. SV analysis of the purified XDD/E3 complex was conducted as described above, covering a concentration range of 6-44 μm. The data were analyzed using the program SEDFIT (20Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), which allows the subtraction of radial and time-independent noise and direct modeling of the sedimentation boundary as a continuous distribution of discrete, non-interacting species (c(s) analysis). Sedimentation coefficients were further evaluated using finite element analysis in SEDFIT, which finds the sedimentation coefficients that best fit the Lamm equation. Buffer density and viscosity as well as protein partial specific volumes were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society for Chemistry, London1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium (SE) analysis of XDD:E3 stoichiometric mixtures was conducted using the same samples analyzed by SV at rotor speeds of 8,500, 12,000, and 16,000 rpm and the base line determined by overspeeding to 49,000 rpm. 20 replicate data sets were recorded using absorbance optics with a step size of 0.001 cm. Samples (30 μl) were loaded into 3-mm double sector charcoal-filled epon centerpieces. Attainment of equilibrium was ascertained with WinMATCH until no net movement of protein was observed in scans recorded 3 h apart. SE data were analyzed using global analysis in the Beckman XL-A/XL-I software implemented in MicroCal ORIGIN. SE analysis of purified XDD/E3 complex was carried out as described above using rotor speeds of 10,500, 15,000, and 18,000 rpm. The data were analyzed as before but included fitting of the second virial coefficient, B. A starting estimate for B of XDD/E3 was calculated using the program COVOL (22Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Jones S. Thornton J.M. Winzor D.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2432-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) based on molecule dimensions and surface charge. The values of Mw,app and B at infinite dilution were determined by plotting 1/Mw,app against concentration (in g/ml), where Mw,app0 is the inverse of the y intercept and Bo can be calculated from the slope. Microcalorimetry—ITC measurements were carried out in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at 25 °C as described by Jung et al. (13Jung H.I. Bowden S.J. Cooper A. Perham R.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All proteins were dialyzed overnight in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. E3 at a concentration of 40.7 μm was injected in 10-μl aliquots into the reaction cell containing 6.2 μm XDD. Data were analyzed using non-linear regression in the MicroCal ORIGIN software package, assuming a simple binding model. Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS experiments were performed on beamline X33 of the EMBL outstation Hamburg at storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY). The scattering curves of purified XDD/E3 complex at concentrations of 1.5, 6.3, 9.6, and 22.6 mg/ml were recorded at 10 °C using a sample-to-detector distance of 2.6 m, covering a range of momentum transfer of 0.01 < s < 0.42 Å-1 (s = 4π sin θ/λ), where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 1.5 Å, the wavelength of the x-rays. The data were normalized to the incident beam and corrected for the detector response. The scattering of the buffer was subtracted and the difference curves scaled for concentration using the program PRIMUS (23Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallgr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2374) Google Scholar). The final scattering curve was obtained by merging the low angle region of the low concentration curve with the high angle region of the high concentration curve to eliminate possible interparticle interaction effects in the low angle region of the high concentration data. The maximum dimension, Dmax, and particle distance distribution function p(r) were obtained by indirect Fourier transformation using the program GNOM (24Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 25Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration, Rg was obtained by employing both the Guinier approximation and GNOM. Ab initio shape reconstruction was done using the programs DAMMIN (26Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and GASBOR (27Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys.

Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 540-544Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) without imposing symmetry restraints. DAMMIN restores the structure as a collection of densely packed beads in a dummy atom model inside a search volume (a sphere with diameter Dmax). The program starts from a random configuration and uses a simulated annealing algorithm to explore the landscape of acceptable low resolution structures. GASBOR represents particles as collections of dummy residues using one dummy residue per amino acid residue. The dummy residues are randomly distributed within the search volume and simulated annealing is used to obtain a chain-compatible spatial distribution. Ten GASBOR models were superimposed and averaged, and the resulting Protein Data Bank file used as search space for a final DAMMIN reconstruction. Homology, Hydrodynamic, and Rigid Body Modeling—A homology model of the human XDD/E3 complex was built using SWISSMODEL (29Guex N. Peitsch M.

Models of XDD/E3 with lipoyl domains in different positions were generated (see “Results”) and their sedimentation coefficients calculated using the program HYDROPRO (33García de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 34García de la Torre J. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 93: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HYDROPRO calculates the hydrodynamic parameters of rigid particles from their atomic structures. For rigid body modeling with the program Rayuela (35Nöllmann M. Stark W.M. Byron O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2005; 38: 874-887Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the complex was defined by five “domains”: E3, XSBD1, XSBD2, XLD1, and XLD2. Rayuela allows translation and rotation of each individual domain, calculates a SAXS curve as well as sedimentation coefficient for each structure, and compares it with the experimental data. Using a simulated annealing algorithm, it determines the lowest energy conformation for each domain. The best model obtained with Rayuela, as judged by its fit to the experimental data, was used for superimposition onto the ab initio model using the program SITUS (36Wriggers W. Birmanns S. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 37Wriggers W. Chacón P. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 779-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Initial binding studies were carried out by mixing either XSBD or XDD with E3 at different molar ratios and subjecting them to native PAGE. The addition of XSBD or XDD to E3 results in a noticeable bandshift, which increases as more XSBD or XDD is added. At a stoichiometry of 2:1 all of the E3 present is shifted into the lower mobility band corresponding to the XSBD/E3 (Fig. 1A) or XDD/E3 (Fig. 1B) complex. At ratios lower than 2:1, excess E3 is seen (Fig. 1), while at stoichiometries higher than 2:1, excess XDD remains (Fig. 1B). At the pH used to conduct native PAGE (pH 8.8), XSBD moves toward the cathode and thereby out of the gel due to its high pI of 9.9. No intermediates in complex formation were observed. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—SV experiments were conducted for uncomplexed E3 and XDD as well as for different XDD:E3 stoichiometries and the sedimentation profiles fitted using c(s) analysis in SEDFIT (20Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). The c(s) profiles of free XDD and E3 show single peaks with apparent sedimentation coefficients of 2.0 and 5.9 S, respectively (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B clearly shows the complete disappearance of the XDD peak at a stoichiometry of 2:1. The E3 and XDD/E3 peaks overlap completely, although the peak position is slightly reduced with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 5.7 S. A globular protein of higher molecular weight is expected to sediment faster (and therefore exhibit a higher sedimentation coefficient) than a protein of lower molecular weight. Therefore, it can be inferred that the complex has an extended shape which offsets the gain in molecular weight with respect to free E3 and causes it to sediment at the same speed as E3. Similarly, the elongated shape and thus the large hydrodynamic radius of XDD/E3 can also be inferred from gel filtration chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1). Its apparent molecular mass, Mw,app, of 300 kDa on a standardized column is considerably higher than predicted from the amino acid sequence (144 kDa). The minor broad peak around 7.5-8 S observed at all ratios corresponds to aggregate species and is greatly reduced if the complex is purified to uniformity by gel filtration prior to AUC analysis (Fig. 2C). c(s) analysis of SV profiles from the purified complex also shows that a single species is present in solution bar a small amount of aggregate that is present at high concentrations only, a result substantiated by native PAGE (results not shown). No free protein or intermediate is observed at any concentration, in accordance with the expected tight interaction between XDD and E3. Finite element analysis of SV data with a single-species model yielded the true sedimentation coefficients for XDD/E3 at all experimental concentrations. These were extrapolated to infinite dilution to give a sedimentation coefficient for XDD/E3 independent of concentration of s2o,wo=5.68±0.05 S (Fig. 2D). The apparent average whole cell molecular weight, Mw,app, was determined for each XDD:E3 stoichiometric mixture using sedimentation equilibrium (SE). The Mw,app peaks, as expected, at a stoichiometry of 2:1 (Fig. 3) when all protein present is associated into complex, due to the tight interaction between XDD and E3. At all other molar ratios, free XDD or E3 is observed, thus depressing Mw,app. The value of Mw,app at a molar ratio of 2:1 (XDD:E3) of 137 kDa is lower than expected when compared with the calculated molecular mass of 144 kDa. This is attributable to the non-ideal behavior of the complex. SE data for XDD/E3 complex purified by gel filtration were also analyzed: agreement with the expected molecular mass was substantially improved when non-ideality arising from molecular shape and surface charge was accounted for by inclusion of the second virial coefficient (Bo) in the data analysis. The values obtained experimentally for Bo (7.2 × 10-4, 1.7 × 10-4, and 2.9 × 10-4 ml mol g-2 for rotor speeds 10,500, 15,000 and 18,000 rpm, respectively) correspond very well to B calculated with COVOL (22Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Jones S. Thornton J.M. Winzor D.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2432-2438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of 1.7 × 10-4 ml mol g-2. When non-ideality is accounted for the molecular weight estimates for XDD/E3 are 151, 142, and 141 kDa for rotor speeds 10,500, 15,000 and 18,000 rpm, respectively (results not shown). These values compare very well to the calculated molecular mass of 144 kDa for a 2:1 complex of XDD:E3. When non-ideality was included in the data analysis for the 2:1 stoichiometric XDD:E3 mixture, Mw,app was increased to 147, 142, and 141 kDa for rotor speeds 8,500, 12,000, and 16,000 rpm, respectively, in excellent agreement with the results for the purified complex and the calculated molecular weight. For all other stoichiometric mixtures of XDD:E3, Mw,app decreased with increasing rotor speed which is indicative of the presence or formation of high molecular weight aggregate, as shown also by the SV results in Fig. 2B. Only for the 1:1 mixture was Mw,app consistently lower than the calculated molecular weight. This was due to the choice of fitting limits: the aggregate was steeply distributed and thus effectively excluded from the subsequent analysis, resulting in an underestimate of Mw,app. Because stoichiometric mixtures other than 2:1 contained more than one species (plus aggregate), the exponential describing the heavier component was disproportionately affected by the inevitable loss of data from the cell base, resulting in a corresponding reduction in Mw,app. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The heats of interaction of XDD with E3 were determined using ITC. Complex formation is exothermic (i.e. negative peaks in the ITC output) (Fig. 4A). Differential thermal binding curves were obtained by integration of the data and analyzed using standard non-linear regression to obtain estimates of the binding stoichiometry, equilibrium association constant, and enthalpy of binding (Fig. 4B). The data confirm the tight binding of XDD to E3 (Ka = 2.8 × 107 m-1) with a stoichiometry of"
https://openalex.org/W2020905873,"How cells coordinate inhibition of growth and division during genotoxic events is fundamental to our understanding of the origin of cancer. Despite increasing interest and extensive study, the mechanisms that link regulation of DNA synthesis and ribosomal biogenesis remain elusive. Recently, the tumor suppressor p14(ARF) (ARF) has been shown to interact functionally with the nucleolar protein B23/NPM (B23) and inhibit rRNA biogenesis. However, the molecular basis of the ARF-B23 interaction is hitherto unclear. Here we show that a highly conserved motif in the B23 oligomerization domain is essential for mediating ARF binding in vivo. Mutagenesis of conserved B23 core residues (L102A, G105A, G107A) prevented B23 from interacting with ARF. Modeling of the B23 core indicated that substitutions in the GSGP loop motif could trigger conformational changes in B23 thereby obstructing ARF binding. Interestingly, the GSGP loop mutants were unstable, defective for oligomerization, and delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. B23 core mutants displayed increased ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We conclude that the functional integrity of the B23 core motif is required for stability, efficient nucleolar localization as well as ARF binding."
https://openalex.org/W1996977424,"Pharmacogenetic approaches can be instrumental for predicting individual differences in response to a therapeutic intervention. Here we used a recently developed murine haplotype-based computational method to identify a genetic factor regulating the metabolism of warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant with a narrow therapeutic index and a large variation in individual dosing. After quantification of warfarin and nine of its metabolites in plasma from 13 inbred mouse strains, we correlated strain-specific differences in 7-hydroxywarfarin accumulation with genetic variation within a chromosomal region encoding cytochrome P450 2C (Cyp2c) enzymes. This computational prediction was experimentally confirmed by showing that the rate-limiting step in biotransformation of warfarin to its 7-hydroxylated metabolite was inhibited by tolbutamide, a Cyp2c isoform-specific substrate, and that this transformation was mediated by expressed recombinant Cyp2c29. We show that genetic variants responsible for interindividual pharmacokinetic differences in drug metabolism can be identified by computational genetic analysis in mice."

The Caenorhabditis elegans genome does not contain an IRP2 homolog or identifiable IREs; its IRP1 homolog has aconitase activity but does not bind to mammalian IREs. The Drosophila genome offers an evolutionary intermediate containing two IRP1-like proteins (IRP-1A and IRP-1B) and target genes with IREs.

These results were also corroborated in whole-fly homogenates from transgenic flies that overexpress IRP-1A and IRP-1B in their fat bodies. Ubiquitous and muscle-specific overexpression of IRP-1A, but not of IRP-1B, resulted in pre-adult lethality, underscoring the importance of the biochemical difference between the two proteins. Domain-swap experiments showed that multiple amino acid substitutions scattered throughout the IRP1 domains are synergistically required for conferring IRE binding activity.

Iron is required for aerobic metabolism and is actively sensed, sequestered, and regulated by organisms, including hosts and pathogens, that often compete for metal acquisition (1Schaible U.E. Kaufmann S.H. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, signals exist for systemic control of iron metabolism (2Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). One of the central regulators of cellular iron metabolism is the IRP/IRE system (3Pantopoulos K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In brief, absence of iron is sensed by IRP1 and IRP2, which then bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) 4The abbreviations used are: IRE, iron-responsive element; IRP, iron-regulatory protein; hIRP, human IRP; pEX, expression vector; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 2-Me, 2-mercaptoethanol. 4The abbreviations used are: IRE, iron-responsive element; IRP, iron-regulatory protein; hIRP, human IRP; pEX, expression vector; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 2-Me, 2-mercaptoethanol. in the 5′-untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding several storage or consumer iron proteins, inhibiting their translation. IRP1 and IRP2 also bind to IREs in the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNAs encoding proteins that function in cellular iron import, stabilizing the transcripts and enhancing iron sequestration. There is much interest in defining how IRP1 and IRP2 sense iron levels. IRP1 interconverts between an iron-sulfur protein with aconitase activity and the apoprotein that binds to the IRE (4Haile D.J.

IRP2 has an additional 73-amino acid domain inserted in the protein and has no aconitase activity (5Iwai K. Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A.

IRP1 also contributes to the regulation of cellular iron metabolism, albeit to a lesser extent, because its iron-sulfur cluster is efficiently repaired and the protein functions mostly as an aconitase (8Meyron-Holtz E.G.

It is also well established that both IRPs also sense and respond to oxidative stress (3Pantopoulos K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1012: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 11Mueller S. Biofactors. 2005; 24: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).The ancestral protein that gave rise to the IRP/IRE system is likely an aconitase, which is broadly distributed in all phyla (12Gruer M.J.

Aconitase activity in both mitochondria and cytosol is also documented for the more primitive protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum, each of which contains a single aconitase gene (15Saas J.

Herein, we have purified heterologously expressed IRP-1A, IRP-1B, and hybrid IRP-1A/IRP-1B proteins and determined that although both IRPs are functional aconitases, only IRP-1A binds IREs. We have also generated transgenic flies that overexpress either protein in a tissue-specific manner and discovered that overexpression of IRP-1A can be lethal.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids and Transgenic Flies—To express recombinant protein in bacteria, the cDNAs corresponding to IRP-1A and IRP-1B (GenBank™ accession code AJ252016 and AJ252017) were cloned into the expression vectors pQE 30 (Qiagen) and into pTrc 99A (Amersham Biosciences), respectively (33Lind M.I. Characterization of Some Iron Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and Pacifastacus leniusculus. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, Uppsala University, Uppsala)Google Scholar). Both expression plasmids (pEX-IRP1A and pEX-IRP1B) introduce a His6 tag in the N terminus of the protein.To produce chimeras between IRP-1A and IRP-1B, oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify pEX-IRP1A DNA fragments with flanking regions corresponding to small parts of the DNA sequence of pEX-IRP1B. Fragments of pEX-IRP1B were then replaced by cloning the PCR products to generate the desired combination of chimeric segments (see Fig. 5A and Table 1). Primers used were 5′-ccatggattaagaattcattaaagaggagaaa-3′ (F1) and 5′-aaggccttagctccccatttgagga-3′ (R1) for the construct pEX-IRP-A, 5′-aaggcctttgataatatgctaattgtgcc-3′ (F2) and 5′-ctcgagtggtcccgagttgccaatg-3′ (R2) for pEX-IRP-B, 5′-ctcgaggagaacgtagtgaacacca-3′ (F3) and 5′-agatctctagtcataccctcgaagaacg-3′ (R3) for pEX-IRP-C, 5′-agatctgcccaaacttaaaggtatc-3′ (F4) and 5′-cttaagacagcattttgcgtatcata-3′ for pEX-IRP-D and F3 and R4 for pEX-IRP-E.

The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing and injected into embryos using conventional techniques (34Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar). All phenotypes reported were confirmed with independent transgene insertions, which were mapped to different chromosomes.Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant IRP-1A was produced in Escherichia coli M15, transformed with the pEX-IRP1A. The bacteria were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml of carbenicillin and 20 μg/ml of kanamycin to a density of A600 = 1 and then treated with 2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 25-27 °C to induce expression of the plasmid. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Large-scale batch purification of His6-IRP-1A under native condition was performed according to the manufacturer for TALON™ Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech). The recombinant protein was then eluted with sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm imidazole and dialyzed against N buffer (24 mm Hepes, 150 mm KOAc, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, pH 7.6) overnight. The protein suspension was concentrated by using Centricon-30 (Amicon), and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The protein was used directly or stored at -80 °C. The isolation of His6-IRP-1B and chimeric His6-IRP-A to His6-IRP-E constructs was done as described above for His6-IRP-1A with the following modifications: E. coli BL21, transformed with the construct pEX-IRP1B or any of the chimeric constructs, was grown in Luria Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed as previously published (29Lind M.I. Ekengren S. Melefors O. Soderhall K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The recombinant IRPs were reduced with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-Me) before addition of the probe. Where indicated, purified IRP-1A and 1B were treated instead with 10 mm cysteine, 50 μm FeSO4, and 5 mm EDTA. For the competition experiment, 100-fold molar excess of cold oligonucleotide was mixed with the radioactive IRE before the protein was added. The gels were subjected to autoradiography or to imaging plates for a fluorescent image analyzer (FLA-3000 system; Fuji Film). The radioactivity was quantified by using the software Multi Gauge v2.2 (Fuji Film).The competitor RNAs (wild type and mutant) have been transcribed from the vectors I-12.CAT and I-19.CAT, respectively (33Lind M.I. Characterization of Some Iron Proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and Pacifastacus leniusculus. 2000; (Ph.D. thesis, Uppsala University, Uppsala)Google Scholar). I-12 is derived from human ferritin IRE, whereas I-19 is identical to I-12 except for a cytosine deletion in the loop, which will prevent binding of IRP.Aconitase Assay—Aconitase activity was measured by the NADP-coupled aconitase assay according to Drapier and Hibbs (35Drapier J.C. Hibbs Jr. J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 26-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 30 °C in a total volume of 500 μl in the presence of 5 μg of recombinant Drosophila IRP-1A or IRP-1B and an excess of isocitrate dehydrogenase (aconitase-free; Sigma), which catalyzes the oxidation of isocitrate into 2-oxoglutarate coupled to the production of NADPH, which is followed at 340 nm. Sample without citrate was used as blank (ΔA340 <0.01/h). For the measurements performed in whole-fly lysates, cis-aconitate (Sigma) was used as a substrate for measuring activity; the in-gel aconitase assay is described in Ref. 10Tong W.H. Rouault T.A.

Soluble proteins with a size of ∼100 kDa were extracted from E. coli by sonication and centrifugation and were isolated by a metal affinity batch method to >90% purity. The efficacy of successive purification steps for isolation of recombinant IRP-1A and IRP-1B was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1). The recovery per liter of culture was ∼0.2 mg for IRP-1A and 1 mg for IRP-1B. Initiation of protein translation at the correct methionine was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing.FIGURE 1Purification of heterologously expressed IRP-1A and IRP-1B. Log phase bacteria containing the expression vector for His6-tagged IRP-1A and IRP-1B, respectively, were induced by 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The bacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in sonication buffer (lanes 1). The suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged. Supernatants (lanes 2) were removed from the pellets (lanes 3) and applied to metal affinity resin to isolate the recombinant proteins. Unbound proteins are shown in lanes 4. After washing the resin, the recombinant proteins were eluted with sonication buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (lanes 5). The molecular masses of standard proteins are shown on the left. The His-IRP-1A and His-IRP-1B bands, respectively, are indicated by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recombinant IRP-1A and IRP-1B Have Aconitase Activity—In silico analysis of IRP-1A and IRP-1B has shown that all amino acids known to participate in the catalytic center of the aconitase enzymes were conserved (17Muckenthaler M. Gunkel N. Frishman D. Cyrklaff A. Tomancak P. Hentze M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that both proteins should be active as aconitases. We tested this hypothesis and confirmed that both IRP-1A and IRP-1B exhibit aconitase activity as purified (Fig. 2A). The bacteria were able to produce a fraction of recombinant IRPs with an intact iron-sulfur cluster, and aconitase activity was in the same range as purified recombinant human IRP1 expressed in a similar prokaryotic system (36Gray N.K.

Thus, D. melanogaster is the first organism shown to contain two active cytosolic aconitases.FIGURE 2Activities of recombinant IRP-1A and IRP-1B. A,5 μg of recombinant IRP-1A (lane 1A) and IRP-1B (lane 1B) were assayed for aconitase activity in coupled aconitase/isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. The activity is expressed as the change in A340 nm per h and μg of recombinant protein. Control samples were run in parallel: C1 is sample without isocitrate dehydrogenase; C2 contains eluate prepared from bacteria transformed with empty expression vector. B, EMSA was used to test binding activity of IRP-1A (lanes 1 and 3) and IRP-1B (lanes 2 and 4) to human (lanes 1 and 2) and Drosophila (lanes 3 and 4) ferritin IREs. 250 ng of recombinant protein in 12 μl of N buffer was first reduced by 2-mercaptoethanol before adding in vitro transcribed radioactive IRE. Free probe (IRE) or probe bound to IRP, e.g. IRE-IRP, are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Only IRP-1A Binds to the IRE—Next we asked whether both IRPs can bind to an IRE. Purified recombinant IRP-1A was able to bind in vitro both Drosophila ferritin IRE and human ferritin IRE in the presence of a reducing agent (Figs. 2B and 4). In contrast, IRP-1B did not show any affinity toward either Drosophila or human ferritin IRE. No IRE binding activity of IRP-1B was detected even when the protein was added in high molar excess or pretreated by different reducing agents, including 2-ME, cysteine, and dithiothreitol (Figs. 2, 4, and 5, and data not shown).FIGURE 4In vitro IRE binding and aconitase activity of recombinant IRP-1A and IRP-1B in response to iron availability. 5 μg of recombinant His-IRP-1A (A) or His-IRP-1B (B) were treated with 10 mm cysteine, 50 μm FeSO4, and 5 mm EDTA as indicated. 1% of the mixture was incubated with radioactive Drosophila ferritin IRE, and IRE binding activity was monitored by EMSA. The rest of the mixture was assayed for aconitase activity in a coupled aconitase/isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. The activity is expressed as the change in A340 nm per h and μg of recombinant protein. No IRE binding activity was detected for His-IRP-1B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test for the binding specificity of IRP-1A to IRE, 100-fold molar excess of non-radioactive IRE was added and allowed to compete for binding. The results showed that cold IRE was able to reduce the binding, whereas the same amount of non-functional IRE did not affect the IRP-1A/IRE radioactive signal, thus demonstrating an IRE-specific binding activity for IRP-1A (Fig. 3). This result combined with previous information (24Rothenberger S. Mullner E.W. Kuhn L.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1175-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Kohler S.A.

Molar excess of radioactive Drosophila ferritin IRE (pDfer IRE) was mixed with 5 ng of purified IRP-1A. When indicated, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (2-Me) was present in the binding reaction. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of non-radioactive (cold) wild-type (wt) IRE or IRE with a cytosine deleted in the loop (mut) was premixed with the probe before addition of the protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)IRP-1A Acquisition of IRE Binding Activity Correlates with Loss of Aconitase Activity—IRP-1A as purified from bacteria has aconitase activity and only binds to IRE upon incubation with reductant (either 2-Me in Figs. 2, 3, and 5 or cysteine in Fig. 4A) by a mechanism that remains to date unclear (38Philpott C.C.

The protective property of iron with respect to cluster disassembly is shown by further addition of EDTA, which again results in loss of aconitase activity and concomitant gain in IRE binding activity, all in agreement with previous work on mammalian IRP1 (26Gray N.K.

In contrast, no IRE binding activity was detected in similar experiments with purified IRP-1B, but aconitase activity of IRP-1B was also dependent on the presence of iron and the absence of highly reducing conditions (Fig. 4B).Domain-swap Experiments—We constructed chimeric IRPs to identify the regions of IRP-1A that contain the critical residues for IRE binding activity. Different fragments of IRP-1B were swapped with fragments from IRP-1A (Fig. 5A and Table 1). Five different chimeras (His-IRP-A to His-IRP-E) were produced with N-terminal His tag in E. coli and purified as previously described for His-IRP1A and His-IRP-1B. Equal amounts (250 ng) of the purified recombinant proteins were then subjected to EMSA, and their IRE binding activity was compared with the activity of His-IRP-1A, which was set to 100% (Fig. 5B). The chimeras His-IRP-B, His-IRP-C, and His-IRP-E were able to bind both human and Drosophila ferritin IRE with an activity of 26 ± 6, 6 ± 2, and 24 ± 5%, respectively. The chimeras His-IRP-A and His-IRP-D did not show binding activity even when 2.5 μg of purified protein was loaded on the gels (data not shown).Overexpression of IRP-1A and IRP-1B in Vivo—To confirm the findings we obtained in vitro, we also generated transgenic flies in which temporal and tissue-specific expression of the endogenous IRPs was achieved by means of the UAS/Gal4 system (41Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of IRP-1A in a single tissue (the fat bodies) resulted in a marked increase of IRE binding activity of whole-fly extracts, whereas no similar effect was seen when IRP-1B was overexpressed (Fig. 6A). At the same time, total aconitase activity of these extracts was increased by 10% in the case of IRP-1A overexpression (p, 0.10) and by 20% when IRP-1B was overexpressed (p, 0.027). Simultaneous overexpression of both proteins resulted in flies with high IRE binding and high aconitase activities (Fig. 6B). Separation of cellular aconitase activities by electrophoresis (10Tong W.H. Rouault T.A.

Electrostatic interactions are considered important driving forces in the association of P450s with their redox partners, which in turn facilitates the transfer of the two electrons. In this study, the cross-linking reagent, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), was used to covalently link cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) with cytochrome b5 (b5) through the formation of specific amide bonds between complementary charged residue pairs.

Subsequent tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of the selected cross-linked peptide candidates led to the identification of two intermolecular cross-links, Lys428(CYP2E1)-Asp53(b5) and Lys434(CYP2E1)-Glu56(b5), which provides the first direct experimental evidence for the interacting orientations of a microsomal P450 and its redox partner.

In microsomal systems, NADPH is the ultimate source of the two electrons, and NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (P450 reductase) together with cytochrome b5 (b5) facilitates the electron transfer. Knowledge of the interactions between P450s and their redox partners is fundamental to a complete understanding of the mechanisms of P450 reactions. The interactions between P450s and b5 have drawn much attention because of variable effects b5 has on different P450 isoforms and P450 reactions. It has been shown that b5 may stimulate, inhibit or have no effects on P450-catalyzed reactions depending on the particular isoform of P450 and the substrate of the reaction (3.Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 4.Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Drug Metab.

However, there is no consensus on whether b5 transfers electrons to P450, or causes an allosteric effect on P450, or whether both mechanisms are simultaneously operative (6.Yamazaki H. Johnson W.W.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, the mechanism of substrate- and P450 isoform dependency is unknown (5.Porter T.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T. Ohyama K. Hatanaka N. Asahi S. Shimada N. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 is a P450 isoform whose reactions are highly stimulated in the presence of b5. For example, we previously found that b5 stimulates CYP2E1-catalyzed oxidation of acetaminophen to its toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), by 25-fold (12.Chen W. Koenigs L.L. Thompson S.J. Peter R.M. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Nelson S.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). For other CYP2E1-catalyzed reactions, such as aniline p-hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation, b5 stimulates the reactions by 270-fold and 67-fold, respectively (5.Porter T.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11.Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T. Ohyama K. Hatanaka N. Asahi S. Shimada N. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast to its stimulating effects on CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2C8, apo-b5 is unable to replace holo-b5 in stimulating CYP2E1-catalyzed reactions (11.Yamazaki H. Nakamura M. Komatsu T. Ohyama K. Hatanaka N. Asahi S. Shimada N. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Nakajima M. Yokoi T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12.Chen W.

The requirement for the heme group increases the probability that b5 stimulates CYP2E1-catalyzed reactions by facilitating electron transfer rather than by only causing a positive allosteric effect. Because intermolecular complex formation immediately precedes electron transfer(13.Rodgers K.K. Sligar S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the identification of the protein interacting regions and orientations in the CYP2E1-b5 complex is an important goal in understanding the effects of b5 on CYP2E1-catalyzed reactions. It has been shown, by site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification, that several cationic residues on the proximal face of P450, and several anionic residues on b5 surrounding the solvent-exposed heme edge, are important for the functional interaction between the two proteins (4.Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Bridges A. Gruenke L. Chang Y.T. Vakser I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15.Hlavica P. Schulze J. Lewis D.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the protein interacting surfaces have not been fully characterized, and the protein interacting orientations have never been determined. One complex model of b5 and CYP101, a microbial P450, was proposed by Sligar and co-workers (16.Stayton P.S. Poulos T.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8201-8205Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) based on visual optimization of the intermolecular electrostatic interactions and minimization of the distance between the redox centers of the two proteins. However, the protein interacting orientations in this model have not been substantiated by experiments. In this study, a complex model of b5 and CYP2E1, a microsomal P450, is proposed based on two chemical crosslinks characterized using mass spectrometry. Because electrostatic interactions are considered the major driving forces for the P450-b5 interaction (4.Schenkman J.B. Jansson I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Bridges A. Gruenke L. Chang Y.T. Vakser I.A. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17036-17049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15.Hlavica P. Schulze J. Lewis D.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a water-soluble cross-linking reagent, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), was chosen to covalently link CYP2E1 with b5. EDC generates “zero-length” cross-links (amide bonds) between basic (Lys) and acidic (Asp or Glu) residues that come into very close proximity (supplemental Fig. S2) (17.Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The short length of EDC cross-links generally leads to specific intra- and intermolecular linkages without sampling multiple protein orientations (17.Grabarek Z. Gergely J. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). EDC was previously used to form a cross-link between CYP2B4 and b5 (18.Tamburini P.P. Schenkman J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, this complex was not structurally characterized. To identify the cross-links in the CYP2E1-b5 complex, the complex was digested and the generated peptides were isotopically labeled. It has been noted that during trypsin-catalyzed proteolysis, two oxygen atoms from solvent are incorporated into the α-carboxyl group of a peptide C-terminally ending with a lysine or an arginine residue (19.Schnolzer M. Jedrzejewski P. Lehmann W.D. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the proteolysis is conducted in fully enriched 18O-water, the generated peptides are labeled with two 18O atoms at their C termini (Fig. 1) (19.Schnolzer M. Jedrzejewski P. Lehmann W.D. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 945-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Yao X. Freas A. Ramirez J. Demirev P.A. Fenselau C. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2836-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Recently, 18O-labeling has been used to identify crosslinked peptides in a digest mixture (21.Back J.W. Notenboom V. de Koning L.J. Muijsers A.O. Sixma T.K. de Koster C.G. de Jong L. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4417-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22.Collins C.J. Schilling B. Young M. Dollinger G. Guy R.K. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 4023-4026Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Through the comparison of peptide ions generated from two digestions, one conducted in 16O-water and the other in 18O-water, cross-linked peptides can be distinguished from non-cross-linked peptides by virtue of incorporating more than two 18O atoms during proteolysis. The structures of the selected cross-linked peptide candidates are subsequently characterized by tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. Here we describe the characterization of two cross-links in the CYP2E1-b5 complex using 18 O-la-importance of the identified ion pairs in the interacting proteins was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, a model that sheds light on the CYP2E1-b5 interaction was constructed. Materials—Escherichia coli strain DH5α containing the expression vector pCWhum3A4(His)6 and strain BL21(DE3) containing the plasmid (His)4HMwRat-b5 were provided by Dr. Ronald W. Estabrook (10.Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23.Holmans P.L. Shet M.S. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α containing the expression vector pCWhum2E1 was from Dr. Elizabeth M. J. Gillam (24.Gillam E.M. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, E. coli DH5αF'IQ Max Efficiency Competent cells, E. coli expressed histidine-tagged recombinant human b5 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Bactotryptone, bactopeptone, and bactoyeast extract were obtained from BD Biosciences Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Emulgen 911 was from Kao Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Ni-NTA Superflow was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The cross-linking reagent EDC was purchased from Pierce. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). 18O-labeled water (99 atom % 18O) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). IPTG, δ-ALA, thiamine, imidazole hydrochloride, protease inhibitor mixture, sodium cholate, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, Copper II chloride dehydrate, DTT, and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HPLC solvents were of the highest grade commercially available and were used as received. All other reagents were analytical grade. Cloning of Histidine-tagged Recombinant Human CYP2E1—The vector construct pCWhum3A4(His)6 (10.Guryev O.L. Gilep A.A. Usanov S.A. Estabrook R.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5018-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was the source of the pCWori+ expression vector for cloning the histidine-tagged CYP2E1 expression vector construct. The cDNA of human CYP2E1 (24.Gillam E.M. Guo Z. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR. Amplifications were performed using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase. Reactions were assembled and heated to 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Cycling was followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. DNA from the reactions was purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit and digested with NdeI and SalI. The digests were then electrophoresed on a 1.1% agarose gel and the CYP2E1 amplicons of expected size were gel-purified using a Qiagen Geneclean kit. The pCWhum3A4(His)6 plasmid was digested with NdeI and SalI to enable gel-purification of the linearized plasmid from which the CYP3A4 insert had been removed. The vector was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and the CYP2E1 fragment was ligated to the vector to generate the histidine-tagged CYP2E1 expression vector construct. Ligation reactions were used to transform DH5α cells. Positive clones containing the desired inserts were verified initially by colony PCR and restriction analysis, and finally by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method. Site-directed Mutagenesis of CYP2E1—The cloned plasmid pCWhum2E1(His)6 was used as the template for amplification reactions with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotide primers used in the generation of K428A and K434A single mutants plasmids were as follows (mismatches indicated by the underlined bases): K428A forward, 5′-GTGACTATTTCGCGCCATTTTCCAC-3′; K428A reverse, 5′-GTGGAAAATGGCGCGAAATAGTCAC-3′. K434A forward, 5′-AAGCCATTTTCCACAGGAGCACGAGTGTGTGCTGGAGAA-3′; K434A reverse, 5′-TTCTCCAGCACACACTCGTGCTCCTGTGGAAAATGGCTT-3′. A double mutant of pCWhum2E1(His)6 containing both the K428A and the K434A replacements was constructed using the K434A single mutant plasmid and the K428A forward and reverse primers. DpnI-digested DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue cells, and DNA from several of the resulting colonies was isolated. The cDNA sequence was analyzed for the presence of the desired mutations and the absence of extraneous mutations (University of Washington Sequencing Facility). Protein Expression and Purification—A single isolated colony of histidine-tagged CYP2E1 was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB-ampicillin media, which was cultivated with shaking at 37 °C overnight and then diluted 1:100 in Terrific Broth containing 100 mg of ampicillin liter−1, 1.0 mm thiamine, and trace elements (25.Bauer S. Shiloach J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1974; 16: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cultures were shaken (180 rpm) at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.4, after which isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm) and δ-ALA (0.5 mm) were added, and the cultures were shaken (160 rpm) at 28 °C for 36 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g (4 °C, 15 min), resuspended in storage buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), pooled into 50-ml Falcon tubes, and recentrifuged at 4000 × g (4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, with the addition of 1 ml of protease inhibitor mixture per liter of the initial culture volume). After the addition of lysozyme (5 mg/liter), the culture was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were homogenized and spun at 150,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in the resuspension buffer by homogenization and stirred at 4 °C for 1 h after the addition of 1% Emulgen 911. After centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 25 min, imidazole was added to the red/orange supernatant to a final concentration of 20 mm. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column that had been pre-equilibrated with 15 column volumes of equilibrium buffer (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 m KCl, 0.05% sodium cholate, 50 μm α-NF, and protease inhibitors). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of washing buffer A (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 40 mm imidazole, 0.05% sodium cholate, 0.02 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). CYP2E1 enzyme was eluted with elution buffer A (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 350 mm imidazole, and 0.02% sodium cholate). The eluted fractions were dialyzed against dialysis buffer A (100 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT). The dialysate was applied slowly (20 ml/hr) to a hydroxyapatite column (1.5 × 3 cm) and washed with 5 column volumes of washing buffer B (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT). The CYP2E1 enzyme was eluted with elution buffer B (300 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol) and dialyzed against dialysis buffer B (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol). Rat b5 expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ronald W. Estabrook and expressed in BL21-DE3 cells using previously described conditions (23.Holmans P.L. Shet M.S. Martin-Wixtrom C.A. Fisher C.W. Estabrook R.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of P450 reductase was accomplished as previously described (26.Shen A.L. Christensen M.J. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19976-19980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking Reactions—All enzymes used for cross-linking reactions were dialyzed against dialysis buffer B. CYP2E1, b5 (human b5 or rat b5) and DLPC were reconstituted with molar ratio of 1:1:500. The solution was gently stirred for 10 min and held at room temperature for 2 h. EDC was added to 8 mm final concentration from a 100 mm stock. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 2 h. Proteolytic Digestions—For in-gel proteolysis, the cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS loading buffer containing 200 mm DTT. SDS-PAGE was performed, and the protein gels were stained by either Coomassie Blue or copper II chloride dihydrate. Copper staining was carried out by soaking the gel in 300 mm CuCl2. When the desired degree of opacity was reached, the staining solution was removed, and the gel was kept in water. The band of interest was excised and washed three times with destaining buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3). After destaining, the gel piece was washed with 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min, dehydrated in 500 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 15 min, and dried in a Speed-Vac for 20 min. Subsequently, the gel was rehydrated with 300 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mm DTT, and incubated at 56 °C for 50 min to reduce the disulfides. Then the gel piece was washed with 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min, dehydrated in 500 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 15 min, and dried in the SpeedVac for 20 min. To alkylate cysteine residues, the gel piece was rehydrated with 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer containing 60 mm iodoacetamide and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 50 min. The gel piece was cut into two halves and both pieces were then washed with 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min, dehydrated in 500 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 15 min and dried in the SpeedVac. The dried gel pieces were rehydrated with two digestion solutions (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, with sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:25 (w/w), prepared with 16O- and 18O-water respectively. The digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 24 h, and the reaction was quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For post-proteolysis (a proteolysis step conducted in 16O-water followed by a post-digest labeling step carried out in 18O-water), subsequent to trypsin digestion in 16O-water, the peptide mixture was dried completely in the SpeedVac. Digestion solution prepared with 18O-water was then added, and the oxygen exchange reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 ° for 24 h. The reaction was quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For in-solution proteolysis, the cross-linking reaction was quenched by the removal of EDC through dialysis against dialysis buffer B. Glycerol was removed by a second dialysis against dialysis buffer C (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4). The sample was dried completely in the SpeedVac and resuspended in 6 m urea, 100 mm Tris-Base, pH 8.0, to yield a protein concentration ∼2 mg/ml. 50 μl of the protein sample was transferred to another microcentrifuge tube and reduced by adding 10 μl of 100 mm Tris-Base, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm DTT. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequent alkylation reactions were initiated by adding 30 μl of 100 mm Tris-Base, pH 8.0, containing 500 mm iodoacetamide. The reactions were allowed to proceed in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were subsequently diluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and centrifuged using an Ultrafree ®-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The dilution and centrifugation steps were repeated three times. Samples were then split into two equal aliquots, which were dried in the SpeedVac. The two dried peptide samples were reconstituted in two digestion solutions (prepared with 16O- and 18O-water respectively). The digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 24 h, and the reaction was quenched with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. ESI-QTOF MS Analysis—Protein mass spectra were recorded on an API-US quadrupole/time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Protein samples were injected on a 300 μm i.d. × 5 cm perfusion column, packed with 20 μm POROS R2 particles (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), operated at a flow rate of 20μl/min and interfaced on-line with the QTOF mass spectrometer. Instrument parameters were as follows: source temperature, 100 °C; N2 drying gas, 50 liters/hr; electrospray voltage, 3.8 kV; and cone voltage, 60 V. Data acquisition was carried out from m/z 800-2400 using a 2.4 s scanning time. The gradient elution profile was set as follows: 5% solvent B for 2 min and 5-90% solvent B over the next 5 min. (solvent A, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptide digests were analyzed using the QTOF mass spectrometer equipped with a CapLC system (Waters, Milford, MA). The stream select module was configured witha5mm × 300 μm i.d. trap column packed with 5-μmC4 particles (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) connected by a ZU1XC metallic union (Valco, Houston, TX) to a 20 cm × 75 μm i.d. nanoscale analytical column packed in-house with 5-μm Jupiter C18 particles (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using the method described by Kennedy and Jorgenson (27.Kennedy R.T. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Peptide samples were injected onto the trap column at 10 μl/min, cleaned-up and back-flushed to the analytical column at 0.5 μl/min using gradient elution. Binary gradients of 5-60% solvent B were generated over 30 min, followed by 60% B for 5 min and 60-90% B for 5 min (solvent A, 3.3% acetonitrile, 1.7% 2-propyl alcohol, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 63.3% acetonitrile, 31.7% 2-propyl alcohol, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). QTOF parameters were set as follows: electrospray potential, 3.6 kV; cone voltage, 35 V; and source temperature, 100 °C. The instrument was operated at a mass resolving power of 6,000. For MS/MS, the scan time was set to 2 s, the precursor isolation width set to 4 Da, and the collision energy set to 25-45 eV according to the m/z of the precursor and the charge state. IT-FT-ICR MS Analysis—Peptide digests were analyzed by electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode on a hybrid ion trap-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corp., San Jose, CA). Nanoflow HPLC was performed using a similar approach to that described by Yi et al. (28.Yi E.C. Lee H. Aebersold R. Goodlett D.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 2093-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The electrospray voltage was applied via a liquid junction using a platinum wire inserted into a micro-tee union (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA). Ion source conditions were as follows: ESI voltage, 1.4 kV; capillary temperature, 200 °C; capillary voltage, 44 V; and tube lens voltage, 180 V. All other voltages were optimized using a tuning solution composed of caffeine (Sigma), MRFA (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) and Ultramark 1621 (Lancaster Synthesis, Windham, NH). Injection waveforms for the LTQ-FT ion trap and ICR cell were kept on for all acquisitions. ICR resolution was set to 50,000 (m/z 400). ICR ion populations in the ICR cell were held at 1e6 and 5e5 for MS and MS/MS, respectively. For MS/MS, the precursor isolation width was set to 10 Da and the collision energy set to 40 and 55% for quintuply and quadruply charged precursor ions, respectively. Acetaminophen (APAP) Oxidation Catalyzed by CYP2E1—Assays of APAP oxidation metabolites were performed with slight modifications to a previously described procedure (12.Chen W. Koenigs L.L. Thompson S.J. Peter R.M. Rettie A.E. Trager W.F. Nelson S.D. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, p"

https://openalex.org/W2088506747,"In SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligases, substrate specificity is conferred by a diverse array of F-box proteins. Only in fully assembled SCF complexes, it is believed, can substrates bound to F-box proteins become ubiquitinated. Here we show that Fbx2, a brain-enriched F-box protein implicated in the ubiquitination of glycoproteins discarded from the endoplasmic reticulum, binds the co-chaperone/ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc-70-interacting protein) through a unique N-terminal PEST domain in Fbx2. CHIP facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of Fbx2-bound glycoproteins, including unassembled NMDA receptor subunits. These findings indicate that CHIP acts with Fbx2 in a novel ubiquitination pathway that links CHIP to glycoprotein quality control in neurons. In addition, they expand the repertoire of pathways by which F-box proteins can regulate ubiquitination and suggest a new role for PEST domains as a protein interaction motif."

https://openalex.org/W2095852114,"The critical role of polyamines in cell growth has led to the development of a number of agents that interfere with polyamine metabolism including a novel class of polyamine analogues, oligoamines. Here we demonstrate that oligoamines specifically suppress the mRNA and protein expression of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and ERα target genes in ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines, whereas neither ERβ nor other steroid hormonal receptors are affected by oligoamines. The constitutive expression of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven exogenous ERα in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was not altered by oligoamines, suggesting that oligoamines specifically suppress ERα transcription rather than affect mRNA or protein stability. Further analysis demonstrated that oligoamines disrupted the DNA binding activity of Sp1 transcription factor family members to an ERα minimal promoter element containing GC/CA-rich boxes. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 or expression of the c-Jun dominant negative inhibitor TAM67 blocked the oligoamine-activated JNK/c-Jun pathway and enhanced oligoamine-inhibited ERα expression, suggesting that AP-1 is a positive regulator of ERα expression and that oligoamine-activated JNK/AP-1 activity may antagonize the down-regulation of ERα induced by oligoamines. Taken together, these results suggest a novel antiestrogenic mechanism for specific polyamine analogues in human breast cancer cells.

Taken together, these results suggest a novel antiestrogenic mechanism for specific polyamine analogues in human breast cancer cells. Polyamines are naturally occurring polycationic alkylamines that are absolutely required for cell growth. Because of their positively charged amine groups, polyamines interact with negatively charged molecules like DNA, RNA, proteins, and phospholipids to modify their structure and conformation. Rapid tumor growth is associated with significantly increased polyamine biosynthesis (1Huang Y. Pledgie A.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Russell D.H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1983; 18: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer, studies have demonstrated the important roles of polyamine biosynthesis and action in tumor development and metastasis, and increased polyamine levels are often associated with aggressive forms of breast tumors (3LaMuraglia G.M.

Treat. 2000; 60: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because of the requirement for polyamines in breast cell growth and the demonstration of dysregulated polyamine metabolism in breast tumor cells, polyamine metabolism has become a rational target for breast cancer therapy. Polyamine analogues were designed based upon the theory that the analogues can mimic some of the self-regulatory functions of natural polyamines but are unable to substitute for natural polyamines in their growth promoting roles (8Marton L.J. Pegg A.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 55-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel class of polyamine analogues has been developed that includes conformationally restricted, cyclic, and long chain oligoamine analogues (9Valasinas A. Reddy V.K. Blokhin A.V. Basu H.S. Bhattacharya S. Sarkar A. Marton L.J. Frydman B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 4121-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our recent studies showed that oligoamines effectively inhibit growth of human breast cancer cell lines in culture and mouse xenografts (10Huang Y. Hager E.R. Phillips D.L. Dunn V.R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Kink J.A. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2769-2777PubMed Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that specific oligoamines reduced ornithine decarboxylase activity and induced the activity of the polyamine catabolic enzyme, spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, thereby significantly decreasing the intracellular polyamine pools in several human breast cancer cell lines (10Huang Y. Hager E.R. Phillips D.L. Dunn V.R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Kink J.A. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2769-2777PubMed Google Scholar, 11Huang Y.

Estrogens are thought to play a major role in breast cancer development. Because of the pivotal role of the estrogen-estrogen receptor (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; PR, progesterone receptor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 3The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; PR, progesterone receptor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. axis in breast cancer progression, targeting ER or its ligands is a major strategy for breast cancer treatment. Estrogen effects are exerted through the activation of specific estrogen receptors. Unfortunately, many breast tumors develop estrogen independence, perhaps as a consequence of multiple mechanisms including altered balance of co-regulatory proteins or the emergence of other growth signaling pathways. These molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood, and this lack of understanding has posed a major clinical challenge in breast cancer therapy. Therefore, elucidation of ER regulatory pathways is critical. A potential interaction between polyamines and ER is suggested by several lines of evidence. For instance, in ER-positive breast cancer cells, estradiol up-regulates ornithine decarboxylase and increases polyamine levels, which accompanies cell proliferation (12Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 29: 189-201Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition is often associated with the down-regulation of polyamine biosynthesis (13Cohen F.J. Manni A. Glikman P. Bartholomew M. Demers L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 6819-6825PubMed Google Scholar). It also has been demonstrated that spermine facilitates the binding of ERα to estrogen response elements (ERE) and that increased polyamine concentrations may induce a DNA sequence containing EREs to undergo conformational transition and enhance the binding of ER to EREs, suggesting a possible mechanism for polyamine-mediated alterations in the interaction of ER with ERE (14Shah N. Thomas T.J. Lewis J.S. Klinge C.M. Shirahata A. Gelinas C. Thomas T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that selective oligoamines specifically suppress the expression and activity of ERα in human breast cancer cells. Oligoamines disrupt the DNA binding activity of Sp1 transcription factor family members at the GC- and CA-rich boxes of the ERα proximal promoter. Additionally, a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) specific inhibitor or expression of a dominant negative c-Jun inhibited ERα expression and enhanced inhibition of ERα expression by the oligoamines, suggesting that the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway is a positive regulator of ERα expression and that oligoamine activated c-Jun activity may antagonize the down-regulation of ERα by oligoamines. Compounds and Culture Conditions—Oligoamines were synthesized as previously reported (9Valasinas A. Reddy V.K. Blokhin A.V. Basu H.S. Bhattacharya S. Sarkar A. Marton L.J. Frydman B. Bioorg. Med.

Stock solutions (10 mm in double distilled H2O) of each analogue were diluted with medium to the desired concentrations for specific experiments. Spermine was purchased from Sigma and was prepared as a stock solution of 10 mm in H2O. 17β-Estradiol was purchased from Sigma. SP600125 (anthra[1,9-cd]pyrazol-6(2H)-one) from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA) was prepared as a stock solution of 20 mm in 100% Me2SO. The human breast cancer MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Plasmid Construction and Stable Transfection—The entire coding region of ERα was PCR-amplified using MCF7 cDNA as template and cloned into the expression vector, pIRESNEO (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The cloned cDNA was verified by sequencing (16Keen J.C. Zhou Q. Park B.H. Pettit C. Mack K.M. Blair B. Brenner K. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29519-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Empty vector or pIRES-ER construct was then transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using Gene Jammer as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Stable colonies were selected and maintained using G418 at a concentration of 500 μg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cDNA of mutant c-Jun (TAM67), which lacks amino acids 3–122 of the transactivation domain, was a generous gift from Drs. Steve Georas (Johns Hopkins) and Michael Birrer (National Institutes of Health) and was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) (11Huang Y. Keen J.C. Hager E. Smith R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). TAM67 constructs were transfected into MCF-7 cells using the same method described above, and stable transfectants were selected and maintained as above. Immunoblotting—Whole cellular proteins were extracted as previously described (10Huang Y. Hager E.R. Phillips D.L. Dunn V.R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Kink J.A. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2769-2777PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared using the NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). The protein concentrations were determined, and Western blotting was performed using the methods described previously (10Huang Y. Hager E.R. Phillips D.L. Dunn V.R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Kink J.A. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2769-2777PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against ERα, ERβ, vitamin D receptor, progesterone receptor (PR), retinoic acid receptor β, cyclin D1, Sp1, Sp3, c-Jun, and JNK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Company (Santa Cruz, CA). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoclonal antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Actin was used to normalize for protein loading. All of the experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Luciferase Reporter Activity Assays—Deletion constructs of the ERα 5′-flanking region in luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic were provided by Dr. Suzanne Fuqua (Baylor College of Medicine). ERE-tk-luc vectors contain four consecutive ERE and were used to measure ER-mediated transcription activity. The cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. 3 μl of Gene Jammer transfection reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to transiently transfect 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter gene constructs. One μg of β-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected with all plasmids to determine transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was measured on a Monolight luminometer using the BrightGlo luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase activity kit (Promega). The experiments were completed three times in triplicate. The Student's t test was used to determine the statistical differences between various experimental and control groups. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Shown are means ± S.D. Reverse Transcription PCR—RNA was harvested using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (16Keen J.C. Zhou Q. Park B.H. Pettit C. Mack K.M. Blair B. Brenner K. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29519-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. PCR was performed using the following primers: ERα sense, GCA CCC TGA AGT CTC TGG AA; ERα antisense, TGG CTA AAG TGG TGC ATG AT (55 °C for 35 cycles); actin sense, ACC ATG GAT GAT GAT ATC GC; and actin antisense, ACA TGG CTG GGG TGT TGA AG (60 °C for 30 cycles). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using the NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). EMSA was performed as described previously (16Keen J.C. Zhou Q. Park B.H. Pettit C. Mack K.M. Blair B. Brenner K. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29519-29524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17deGraffenried L.A. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides (2 × 104 counts/min/lane), which span the ERα promoter from –245 to –182 bp. For supershift assays, the cell extracts were preincubated with 2 μg of antibody for 20 min on ice. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled 21-bp oligonucleotide probe, which contains the minimal consensus binding site for Sp1 transcription factor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Company) was used as a competitor. The reactions were then separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer followed by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (18Sharma D. Blum J. Yang X. Beaulieu N. Macleod A.R. Davidson N.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). After treatment, the cells were exposed to formaldehyde to cross-link proteins, and chromatin samples were sonicated on ice three times for 10 s each (to give an average length of 1–1.5 kb sheered genomic DNA) followed by centrifugation for 10 min. The antibodies for Sp1 family members were used for immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA complexes. PCR primers flanking the Sp1-binding sites of the ERα promoter were designed as follows: sense, 5′-ACC TTA GCA GAT CCT CGT; and antisense, 5′-GCT GCT GGA TAG AGG CTG A. Genomic DNA was used as a positive control (input). Chromatin eluted from immunoprecipitations lacking antibody was used as a “no antibody” control. PCR products were run on 1% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide staining. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—The immunoprecipitation of JNK kinase and kinase activity assays were performed as described previously (19Huang Y. Pledgie A. Rubin E. Marton L.J. Woster P.M. Sukumar S. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, JNK complexes were immunoprecipitated by anti-JNK rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The kinase assays were performed by the addition of 2 μg of substrate protein, 20 μm cold ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The product was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. Inhibition of ERα Expression by Oligoamines—Three representative oligoamine analogues, CGC-11144, CGC-11159, and CGC-11172, were selected for this study (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether oligoamines affect hormonal signaling pathways in breast cancer cells, the protein expression of several breast cell growth-related hormone receptors including the ERα,ERβ, vitamin D receptor, and retinoic acid receptor β were examined. All three oligoamines specifically down-regulated the protein level of ERα in two ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, whereas the protein expression of ERβ, vitamin D receptor, and retinoic acid receptor β was not affected by oligoamines (Fig. 1B). Further, Western blot analysis showed that the expression of two ERα-regulated genes, progesterone receptors (PRA and PRB), and cyclin D1 was also inhibited by oligoamines (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that oligoamines specifically target ERα and its downstream genes in breast cancer cells. Down-regulation of ERα by oligoamines displays clear time-, concentration-, and cell type-dependent features in that ERα expression was inhibited by oligoamines after a 72-h exposure in MCF-7 cells and a 16-h exposure in T47D cells (Fig. 1C). A minimum CGC-11144 concentration of 5 μm is required to decrease ERα protein in MCF-7 cells treated for 96 h and T47D cells treated for 24 h (Fig. 1, C and D). Oligoamines Down-regulate ER-mediated Transcription Activity—Ligand-activated ER dimers can bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) of target genes and regulate their transcription. To determine whether oligoamine down-regulation of ERα affects ER-mediated transcriptional activity, MCF-7 or T47D cells were treated with various oligoamines for different times with 10 nm 17β-estradiol (E2), and the subcellular localization of ERα and ERβ was examined by immunoblotting using nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Treatment with E2 alone (control) led to nuclear localization of ERα, whereas the nuclear ERα protein was significantly decreased by treatment with oligoamines. By contrast, most of the ERβ protein remained in the cytosol after the stimulation of E2, and oligoamine treatment did not affect either the level of protein expression or the cellular localization of ERβ (Fig. 2A). Polyamine analogues specifically down-regulate ERα expression without affecting the expression of ERβ. To verify that decreased ERα expression is associated with decreased ERα-mediated transcription activities, MCF-7 and T47D cells were transiently transfected with the ERE-tk-luciferase constructs. Reporter gene activities were measured after 24 h of oligoamine treatment in T47D cells and after 96 h of treatment in MCF-7 cells. E2 significantly increased ERE reporter gene activities in both ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with all oligoamines significantly suppressed the level of reporter gene activity in both cell lines, suggesting that down-regulation of ERα protein expression by oligoamines leads to the subsequent suppression of ER-mediated transcriptional activities (Fig. 2B). Down-regulation of ERα by Oligoamines Is Caused by Transcriptional Repression—To elucidate the possible mechanism by which oligoamines down-regulate ERα, reverse transcription-PCR was performed to determine the ERα mRNA level in MCF-7 and T47D cells after treatment with oligoamines. Reverse transcription-PCR results showed that ERα mRNA was markedly decreased by oligoamines in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether the down-regulation of ERα by oligoamines occurs through the regulation of the promoter activity of the ERα gene, 4.1 kb of the ERα 5′-flanking region linked to a luciferase reporter pGL3-Basic vector was transiently transfected into T47D cells followed by treatment with CGC-11144 as a representative oligoamine. The results showed that endogenous ERE-luciferase activity is significantly suppressed by CGC-11144 (Fig. 3B). To further validate that oligoamine-induced down-regulation of ERα is caused by the repression of ER transcription rather than by enhanced protein degradation, the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line was stably transfected with an ERα cDNA construct that lacks any 5′ ERα promoter sequence and that is driven by the CMV promoter in a pIRES vector (MDA-MB-231-ERα). Two single clones (ER19 and ER28) that express ERα at a level comparable with that observed in MCF-7 cells were identified and selected for a series of functional assays (Fig. 4A). To test whether constitutively expressed ERα is functional in MDA-MB-231 cells, an ERE-tk-luciferase reporter gene activity assay was used to demonstrate that E2 induced ERE reporter gene expression (luciferase) in both ERα transfected clones, but not in vector controls (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that exogenously introduced ERα in ERα-negative breast cancer cells has intact ER signaling in response to estradiol. Further, Western blotting demonstrated that the ERα protein level was not affected by oligoamine treatment in either clone ER19 (Fig. 4C) or ER28 (not shown), thereby providing evidence that oligoamine-induced down-regulation of ERα indeed occurs through repression of ERα promoter activity rather than enhanced protein degradation. Oligoamines Disrupt ERα Promoter Activity within a Proximal Region Containing an Sp1-binding Site—The exact molecular mechanisms for regulation of ERα expression in breast cancer cells are unclear, but studies suggest that the regulation is at least partially transcriptional (20deConinck E.C. McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2191-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using deletion luciferase reporter constructs of the ERα promoter, we found that CGC-11144 inhibited the reporter gene activity of the proximal ERα minimal promoter region –245 to +212 bp (Fig. 5A). This fragment contains the GC- and CA-rich boxes that are binding sites for Sp1 transcription factor family members and other zinc finger transcription factors. To ascertain whether oligoamines alter the recruitment of Sp1 family members to this element, a radiolabeled oligonucleotide spanning the ERα promoter region from –245 to –182 bp was used as a probe with T47D nuclear extracts in EMSA analysis. Shifted protein-DNA complexes were clearly observed in untreated cells, and oligoamines markedly reduced protein binding to this element (Fig. 5B). The binding of Sp1 to this element was confirmed by supershift analysis (Fig. 5B). Competition with an unlabeled probe consisting of the minimal Sp1 consensus sequence clearly inhibits the binding of transcription factor complex to the ERα minimal promoter region (Fig. 5C). This result suggests that the EMSA is generated by a protein contacting the Sp1-binding site at the ERα minimal promoter and not other sequences, such as the E box. In addition, the labeled probe was incubated with Sp1 antibody only, and no shift was observed. This result rules out the possibility of a direct interaction between labeled probe and antibody (Fig. 5C). To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the interruption of the DNA binding activity of the Sp1 family of transcription factors by oligoamines, Western analysis was used to examine whether oligoamines affected the protein expression of Sp1 and/or Sp3, two transcription factors that directly bind to GC boxes and transactivate the ER minimal promoter (17deGraffenried L.A. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CGC-11144 did not change the protein level of Sp1 or Sp3 (Fig. 5D), indicating that its interruption of Sp1 transcription factor family activity is not through diminished protein expression. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the –245 to –182 element of the ERα promoter was confirmed, and CGC-11144 treatment led to a significant decrease of Sp1 and Sp3 recruitment to the ERα promoter (Fig. 5E). Effects of JNK/AP-1 on Oligoamine-regulated ERα Expression—The cross-talk between the estrogen signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways has been intensively studied. To date, one enhancer region termed ER-EH0 (–3778 to –3744 bp; Fig. 3B) containing an AP-1-binding site has been identified as a potential regulatory region in the ERα promoter (21Tang Z. Treilleux I. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1274-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that activation of the JNK/AP-1 signaling cascade protects breast cancer cells from oligoamine-induced cell death in breast cancer cells (11Huang Y. Keen J.C. Hager E. Smith R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate whether the JNK/AP-1 pathway is involved in regulation of oligoamine-induced ERα down-regulation, an in vitro JNK kinase assay was used to examine whether oligoamines affect JNK kinase activity in MCF-7 cells. c-Jun fusion protein containing the JNK phosphorylation sites was used as substrate for the kinase assay, and the JNK complex was immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells by using a JNK1 monoclonal antibody. The results indicate that the phosphorylation of substrate c-Jun protein (p-c-Jun) is stimulated by CGC-11144. However, simultaneous treatment with SP600125, a selective JNK inhibitor, significantly blocked both the basal JNK and CGC-11144-induced activity (Fig. 6A). SP600125 alone inhibited ERα expression, but combined treatment with SP600126 and CGC-11144 reduced ERα expression below detectable levels (Fig. 6A). These results indicate that JNK/AP-1 is a positive regulator of ERα expression and that oligoamine enhanced JNK/AP-1 activity may antagonize the down-regulation of ERα by oligoamines. To define more precisely the effect of the JNK/AP-1 pathway on oligoamine-induced ERα down-regulation, a previously described vector expressing the c-Jun dominant negative mutant, TAM67, was stably transfected into MCF-7 cells (11Huang Y. Keen J.C. Hager E. Smith R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero Jr., R.A. Davidson N.E. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, MCF-7 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1-TAM67 vector expressed a ∼29-kDa dominant negative mutant c-Jun protein. Overexpression of TAM67 inhibited ERα expression, and treatment with CGC-11144 further reduced ERα expression in TAM67-transfected cells. These results provide further evidence that the JNK/AP-1 pathway is important for ERα expression and that inhibition of this pathway may enhance down-regulation of ERα expression by oligoamines. To further confirm that the regulation of ERα by c-Jun occurs through an effect on the promoter activity of the ERα gene, we investigated ERα protein expression in CGC-11144- and/or SP600125-treated MDA-MB-231-ER19 cells stably expressing exogenous ERα. Treatment with either SP600125 or CGC11144 or the combination of the two agents did not alter ERα protein expression driven by the CMV promoter (Fig. 6C). This result clearly indicates that the effect of AP-1 on ERα expression occurs through transcriptional regulation on the natural promoter of ERα rather than through an effect on ERα protein itself. Natural polyamine levels in breast tumors are usually higher than in adjacent normal tissues, and dysregulated polyamine metabolism has been well demonstrated in breast cancer (1Huang Y. Pledgie A.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that a novel class of polyamine analogues, oligoamines, effectively inhibits growth of human breast cancer cells in culture and nude mouse xenografts (10Huang Y. Hager E.R. Phillips D.L. Dunn V.R. Hacker A. Frydman B. Kink J.A. Valasinas A.L. Reddy V.K. Marton L.J. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2769-2777PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular events underlying oligoamine cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells are currently unknown. A number of recent studies have identified a wide range of important molecular targets for polyamine analogues in human breast cancer cells and one of these targets is ERα (1Huang Y. Pledgie A.M. Casero R.A. Davidson N.E. Anticancer Drugs. 2005; 16: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our current studies demonstrate that oligoamines specifically inhibit ERα protein expression but do not affect the expression of ERβ or other specific steroid hormonal receptors. Oligoamine inhibition of ERα expression also leads to the down-regulation of ERα-mediated transcriptional activity and the loss of expression of several important ERα target or partner genes, including PR and cyclin D1. Based on these observations, we envision that ERα is an important molecular target of oligoamines in breast cancer cells and that down-regulation of ERα may contribute to oligoamine cytotoxicity in ER-positive human breast cancer cells. There is a significant difference in the timing of the decrease in ERα expression between T-47D and MCF-7 cells by oligoamines. The possible mechanisms include variable polyamine transport, intracellular polyamine metabolism regulation, drug resistance mechanisms, etc., which may affect the accumulation of polyamines and/or analogues in tumor cells. In addition, it will be important to further elucidate whether the regulation of oligoamines on ERα target genes occurs through down-regulation of ERα or a more global effect of the analogues. Our analyses using a series of ERα transcription activity assays demonstrate that oligoamine-inhibited ERα expression results from the suppression of ERα transcription rather than changes in protein stability. Furthermore, oligoamine treatment affects ERα transcription apparently by altering the binding of Sp1 transcription factor family members to the –245 to –182 bp proximal promoter element, which contains the GC-rich box of binding sites. It has been known for some time that polyamine-mediated conformational changes in DNA can alter the transcriptional activity of genes. Although it is still unclear whether polyamines interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner, several studies have suggested that the GC-rich region in the major groove of DNA is one of the preferred sites for spermine binding (22Haworth I.S. Rodger A. Richards W.G. Proc. Biol. Sci. 1991; 244: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Zakrzewska K. Pullman B. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Feuerstein B.G. Williams L.D. Basu H.S. Marton L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 46: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Polyamine-modulated protein-DNA interactions may also regulate the binding activity of regulatory proteins to specific DNA sequences in the gene promoter (25Panagiotidis C.A. Artandi S. Calame K. Silverstein S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1800-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Sp1 transcription factor family is an important class of transcription factors whose activity may be regulated by natural polyamines. For example, a recent study found that the binding of Sp1 to the GC box of the spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase promoter is essential for transcription of this key polyamine catabolism enzyme, and a polyamine-responsive element seemed to be responsible for the elevated transcription (26Tomitori H. Nenoi M. Mita K. Daino K. Igarashi K. Ichimura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1579: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because of structural similarity, oligoamines may strongly compete with the binding of natural polyamines to specific DNA sequences like the GC-rich regions, thus leading to the interruption of normal transcription machinery. Our recent studies indicate that co-treatment with spermine prevents the decreased expression of ERα by oligoamines, and luciferase activity assay shows that oligoamine-suppressed ERE reporter gene expression was prevented by simultaneous treatment with spermine (data not shown). However, there are multiple mechanisms by which these findings can result. Because spermine competes with the oligoamines for uptake, one likely interpretation is that spermine prevents down-regulation of ERα expression by competing with oligoamines for transport into the cells. The net effect is that the combination treatment leads to maintenance of the natural polyamine level that prevents the oligoamine-induced ERα down-regulation. The JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway is a key component of many signal transduction pathways and plays a critical role in the control of growth in breast cancer cells. A 35-bp element called ER-EH0 mapped from –3778 to –3744 bp upstream of the ERα mRNA start site forms multiple DNA-protein complexes, including an AP-1-containing complex with strong promoter activity in ER-positive breast cancer cells (21Tang Z. Treilleux I. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1274-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our data show that oligoamines activate the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway. Use of the JNK-specific inhibitor (SP600125) or a dominant negative mutant c-Jun (TAM67) markedly inhibits ERα expression and potentiates oligoamine down-regulation of ERα expression. These findings provide evidence that activation of JNK signaling stabilizes ERα transcription and may play a role in modulating oligoamine down-regulation of ERα expression. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of the effect of the JNK/AP-1 pathway on oligoamine down-regulation of ERα gene expression may be helpful in designing treatment strategies combining oligoamines and JNK/AP-1 inhibitors. In summary, we have demonstrated that oligoamines specifically suppress the expression and activity of ERα, a principal determinant of growth and differentiation in human breast cancer cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that oligoamines may interact with other critical regulatory proteins like Sp1 and AP-1 to mediate ERα expression. These data indicate a new approach to modulating estrogen signaling utilizing these novel analogues. These findings also suggest a relationship between polyamines and ERα expression in breast cancer cells and underscore the rationale of targeting polyamine metabolism as a potential approach to breast cancer therapy and/or prevention."

This region is further subdivided into the KS-rich domain and two adjacent CS-rich domains (CS1 and CS2). The CS1 domain of the human is unique in exhibiting length polymorphism due to a variable number of tandem amino acid repeats. The focus of this work was to determine how length polymorphism affects the structure of the CS1 domain and whether CS and KS chains can coexist in the different glycosaminoglycan-attachment domains. The CS1 domain possesses several amino acid repeat sequences that divide it into three subdomains. Variation in repeat number may occur in any of these domains, with the consequence that CS1 domains of the same length may possess different amino acid sequences. There was no evidence to support the presence of KS in either the CS1 or the CS2 domains nor the presence of CS in the KS-rich domain. The structure of the CS chains was shown to vary between the CS1 and CS2 domains, particularly in the adult, with variation occurring in chain length and the sulfation of the non-reducing terminal N-acetyl galactosamine residue. CS chains in the adult CS2 domain were shorter than those in the CS1 domain and possessed disulfated terminal residues in addition to monosulfated residues. There was, however, no change in the sulfation pattern of the disaccharide repeats in the CS chains from the two domains.

Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan in the extracellular matrix of tissues such as cartilage (1Hascall V.C. ISI Atlas Sci. Biochem. 1988; 1: 189-198Google Scholar, 2Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Kimata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and intervertebral disc (3Oegema T.R. Clinics Sports Med. 1993; 12: 419-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and endows these tissues with their turgid nature or ability to resist compression. These properties are related to the high fixed charge density of the aggrecan and its ability to form aggregates in association with hyaluronan, which in turn are intimately related to its structure. Aggrecan consists of a central core protein possessing multiple carbohydrate side chains. The glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), 2The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; CS, chondroitin sulfate; CS1 and CS2, CS-attachment domains of aggrecan; DMMB, dimethyl methylene blue; G1, G2, and G3, globular regions of aggrecan; KS, keratan sulfate. chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS), form the bulk of the carbohydrate (1Hascall V.C. ISI Atlas Sci. Biochem. 1988; 1: 189-198Google Scholar) and are responsible for the fixed charged density. O-linked and N-linked oligosaccharides are also present (4Nilsson B. De Luca S. Lohmander S. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10920-10927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but their function is less clear. The aggrecan core protein is divided into multiple structural regions (Fig. 1), which serve unique functions (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol.

Three globular regions (G1, G2, and G3) are present, with two being at the amino terminus of the core protein (G1 and G2) and one at the carboxyl terminus (G3). The amino-terminal G1 region is responsible for the interaction with hyaluronan (9Fosang A.J. Hardingham T.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and is separated from the G2 region by a short interglobular domain. The G2 and G3 regions are separated by a long extended domain to which the majority of GAG chains are attached. This GAG-attachment region is subdivided into three adjacent domains, termed the KS-rich domain (10Barry F.P. Neame P.J. Sasse J. Pearson D. Matrix. 1994; 14: 323-328Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the CS1 domain, and the CS2 domain. Although CS and KS predominate in their respective domains, it is not clear that they do so exclusively. This is particularly true in the adult, where KS content increases and CS content decreases (11Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that some of the additional KS may reside in the CS1 or CS2 domains (3Oegema T.R. Clinics Sports Med. 1993; 12: 419-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Heinegard D. Axelsson I. J. Biol.

Human aggrecan is unique among the species studied to date in possessing structural polymorphism within its CS1 domain (14Doege K.J. Coulter S.N. Meek L.M. Maslen K. Wood J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13974-13979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In all species, the CS1 domain is composed of adjacent repeats of a relatively conserved amino acid sequence, although the number of repeats does vary between species. In the human, the repeat sequence is 19 amino acids long and possesses two attachment sites for CS. However, unlike other species, the number of repeats in the human varies between individuals. To date, human CS1 domains varying from 13 to 33 repeats have been described, with sizes of 26–28 repeats being most common. The structure of the amino acid repeats does not show absolute conservation as the amino acids at positions 6, 11, and 12 of each repeat may vary (Fig. 1). The repeats may be divided into three groups: the aminoterminal repeats possessing threonine at residue 6 and aspartic acid at residue 12, the central repeats possessing alanine at residue 6 and aspartic acid at residue 12, and the carboxyl-terminal repeats possessing threonine at residue 6 and glutamic acid at residue 12. The carboxyl-terminal repeats may be further subdivided according to whether aspartic acid or glutamic acid resides at residue 11. At present, it is unclear whether size polymorphism results from repeat number variation in all three CS1 subdomains or just the longer central subdomain. The purpose of this work was to resolve some of these unanswered questions by determining the origin of size polymorphism in the CS1 domain, whether KS is present in the CS1 or CS2 domains or CS is present in the KS-rich domain and whether CS in the CS1 and CS2 domains is of an identical structure. Source of DNA—Genomic DNA was isolated from outdated peripheral blood obtained from the Red Cross blood bank. DNA was purified using DNA isolation kits (Qiagen). Aggrecan Polymorphism Analysis—The aggrecan CS1 encoding domain was amplified by PCR using 50 of ng DNA and upstream sense and downstream antisense primers, 5′-TAGAGGGCTCTGCCTCTGGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-AGGTCCCCTACCGCAGAGGTAGAA-3′, respectively (14Doege K.J. Coulter S.N. Meek L.M. Maslen K. Wood J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13974-13979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To ensure an adequate yield of amplicons that are commonly in the 1–2-kbp range, the Expand long template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions for buffer 2. Samples were denatured for 2 min at 95 °C and then subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation for 40 s at 95 °C, annealing for 40 s at 66.5 °C, and extension for 2 min at 68 °C. After the final cycle, the mixture was left at 68 °C for 10 min. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—PCR products (10 μl from a 50-μl PCR reaction) were analyzed in 0.8% agarose (Invitrogen) gels in Tris borate EDTA buffer at 90 V for 2 h. A standard DNA ladder was run on the same gel to permit chain lengths, and hence, repeat numbers to be determined. DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Nucleotide Sequencing—PCR products representing each allele were isolated by TA cloning (Invitrogen) following insertion into pCR2.1-TOPO and expansion in TOP10-competent Escherichia coli, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identity and size of each cloned PCR product was verified by PCR amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis, as described above. Each plasmid was linearized using EcoRI and then sequenced by Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing on an ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer. All sequence reactions were repeated two times. Source of Cartilage—Articular cartilage was obtained from the femoral condyles at the time of autopsy from individuals ranging in age from the newborn to the mature adult. All tissue was collected within 20 h of the time of death. Preparation of Aggrecan—Cartilage was finely divided then extracted with 4 m guanidunium chloride, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing proteinase inhibitors (11Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction was for 48 h at 4 °C with continuous stirring. The extract was then filtered through glass wool to remove the cartilage residue, and CsCl was added to give a density of 1.5 g/ml (11Roughley P.J. White R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mixture was subjected to density gradient centrifugation at 100,000 gav for 48 h at 10 °C (15Hascall V.C. Sajdera S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2384-2396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting density gradients were fractionated, and fractions with a density greater than 1.55 g/ml were pooled and then dialyzed exhaustively against water before freeze drying. Trypsin Digestion—Aggrecan was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2. Trypsin (tosylamide phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, Sigma) was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in the above buffer and added to the aggrecan solution at 10 μl/ml (10 μg of trypsin/1 mg of aggrecan) (16Roughley P.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1978; 6: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) at 5 μg/μg of trypsin. DEAE Chromatography—The DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) was packed into a 17 × 1.5-cm column (Bio-Rad) to give a 5-ml bed volume. The resin was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The trypsin-digested aggrecan was loaded in the same buffer, and bound material was eluted with a 0.15–1.5 m NaCl gradient (100 ml) at a flow rate of 27 ml/h. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and analyzed for GAG content. Selected fractions were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Sepharose CL-4B Chromatography—The Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was packed into a 120 × 1-cm column with a bed volume of 90 ml. The resin was equilibrated in 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The trypsin-digested aggrecan (1 mg in 1 ml of the same buffer) was loaded on the column and then eluted at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed for GAG content. Selected fractions were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—Samples of intact or trypsin-digested aggrecan (5 μl of 1 mg/ml) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (17Björnsson S. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 1.2% agarose gels were prepared by dissolving 0.48 g of agarose (Seakem) in 40 ml of 0.1 m Tris acetate, pH 7.3. Gels were cast in 10 × 10-cm plates using 3-mm spacers and 10-well combs, and electrophoresis was performed using a Bio-Rad mini gel system. Samples were loaded in 20 μl of 0.5% agarose, 50 mm Tris, 0.384 m glycine, pH 8.3, containing 0.005% bromphenol blue, which was allowed to gel before electrophoresis at 90 V for about 1.5 h. Electrophoresis was terminated when the tracking dye had moved about 2.5–3 cm. Gels were stained with 0.02% toluidine blue (Chroma-Gesellschaft), 0.5% Triton X-100 in 3% acetic acid for 1–2 h and then destained initially in 3% acetic acid and finally water. When the background was clear, gels were dried onto GelBond (Mandel). Alternatively, gels were processed for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) were wet and then incubated for 5 min in 1% cetyl pyridinium chloride (Sigma) dissolved in 30% 1-propanol (18Karlsson M. Edfors-Lilja I. Bjornsson S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 0.15 m NaCl was then added, and incubation continued with gentle agitation for 15 min. The derivatized membrane was rinsed repeatedly with 0.15 m NaCl with vigorous shaking until there was no more foaming. Aggrecan or trypsin-generated fragments were then transferred to the derivatized membrane by capillary blotting, overnight at room temperature. Membranes were then blocked overnight in 5% skim milk (Carnation instant skim milk powder) dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (BDH Laboratory Supplies). The blocked blots were probed with a rabbit anti-CS1 antiserum at a dilution of 1:1,000 or a mouse anti-KS antibody (19Poole A.R. Webber C. Reiner A. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:5,000 followed by immunolocalization using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The rabbit anti-CS1 antiserum was raised to a synthetic peptide, GRIEWPSTPTVGELGC, conjugated to ovalbumin (20Hughes C.E. Caterson B. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16011-16014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues 2–14 of the peptide correspond to an amino acid sequence at the aminoterminal end of the human CS1 domain. GAG Digestion—For keratanase II and endo-β-galactosidase (BioLynx Inc.) digestion following trypsin treatment, the samples were dialyzed into 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Enzymes were then added to the sample to give a final concentration of 0.005 microunits of enzyme/μg of proteoglycan (21Roughley P.J. White R.J. Cs-Szabó G. Mort J.S. Osteoarthritis Cart. 1996; 4: 153-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. For chondroitinase ABC (MP Biomedicals Inc.) digestion following trypsin treatment, the samples were dialyzed into 100 mm Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.3. Chondroitinase was then added at 0.05 microunits/μg of proteoglycan (21Roughley P.J. White R.J. Cs-Szabó G. Mort J.S. Osteoarthritis Cart. 1996; 4: 153-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. GAG Analysis—GAG analysis was carried out using the dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB) dye binding assay (22Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar) adapted for use with 96-well plates (23Hollander A.P. Atkins R.M. Eastwood D.M. Dieppe P.A. Elson C.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1991; 83: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CS and KS Analysis—CS and KS present in trypsin-generated proteoglycan fragments were analyzed by fluorophore-assisted capillary electrophoresis (24Calabro A. Midura R. Wang A. West L. Plaas A. Hascall V.C. Osteoarthritis Cart. 2001; 9: S16-S22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Plaas A.H. West L.A. Thonar E.J.A. Karcioglu Z.A. Smith C.J. Klintworth G.K. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39788-39796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) following digestion of the samples with chondroitinase ABC or keratanase II/endo-β-galactosidase, respectively. CS1 Polymorphism—Genomic DNA from different individuals was analyzed by PCR using primers spanning the CS1-encoding domain. The length of the PCR product was then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis and used to determine the number of 57-bp repeats. This indicated that the number of 19-amino acid repeats present in the CS1 domain ranged from 20 to 29 in the population under study. Nucleotide sequence analysis was then used to determine the structural heterogeneity present within the repeats (Fig. 2). The published aggrecan DNA sequence contains 19 repeats (6Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with 5, 11, and 3 repeats being in the amino-terminal, central, and carboxyl-terminal subdomains, respectively. Repeat number variation was shown to be present in all three subdomains. Of the nine alleles analyzed, the number of amino-terminal repeats ranged from three to six, and the number of central repeats ranged from 11 to 22. There were always two or three carboxyl-terminal repeats, with the repeat adjacent to the central subdomain being absent or present. There appeared to be no relationship between total repeat number and the number of repeats within the subdomains, and alleles with the same total number of repeats could show different patterns of heterogeneity. GAG Distribution—Aggrecan from adult human articular cartilage showed size heterogeneity when analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, with a three-component pattern being visualized by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 3A). Immunoblotting revealed that each of these components possess the CS1 domain (Fig. 3B) and also possess KS (Fig. 3C). It is therefore likely that the components differ by proteolytic processing within the CS2 domain. Trypsin digestion was carried out to further analyze the GAG distribution among the different domains within the GAG-attachment region. In human aggrecan, there are no lysine or arginine residues within the CS1 domain, and hence, it remains intact following trypsin treatment (6Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the KS-rich domain and the CS2 domain are cleaved at 3 and 17 sites, respectively, to yield fragments with 20–140 amino acid residues. The CS1 domain will vary in size depending on the number of repeats that are present, and it is contained within a fragment ranging from 254 to 734 amino acid residues (14Doege K.J. Coulter S.N. Meek L.M. Maslen K. Wood J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13974-13979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hence, the CS1 fragment is always much larger than any of the trypsin-generated fragments from the KS-rich or CS2 domains. Upon agarose gel electrophoresis, the trypsin-generated aggrecan fragments showed a three-component pattern with all components being of greater mobility than any of the components present in the intact molecule (Fig. 3A). Upon immunoblotting, only the slowest migrating of the trypsin-generated components was shown to contain the CS1 domain (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the KS chains migrated in the vicinity of the component of intermediate mobility (Fig. 3C). Trypsin digestion was also used to analyze aggrecan from individuals of different ages from the neonate to the mature adult. In all cases, the three-component pattern was observed on toluidine blue staining (Fig. 4A), although the mobility of each component increased with age. In addition, the staining intensity for the intermediate component increased with age, and that for the most mobile component decreased with age. Chondroitinase digestion eliminated toluidine blue staining in the fastest and slowest migrating components, indicating the presence of CS, and diminished staining in the intermediate component, suggesting the presence of both CS and KS. Immunoblotting verified the presence of KS only in the region of the intermediate migrating components (Fig. 4B) and the presence of the CS1 domain in the slower migrating component (data not shown). It was apparent that the degree of anti-CS1 immunoreactivity varied between different individuals, probably indicative of sequence variation within the peptide epitope. To determine whether CS and KS were present on the same peptide fragments, trypsin-generated fragments from a mature adult were treated with chondroitinase, keratanase, or endo-β-galactosidase prior to analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The mature adult was chosen as it contains the maximal content of KS, although similar results were obtained at all ages. Analysis of the CS1 domain showed no change in mobility upon treatment with either keratanase or endo-β-galactosidase, supporting the absence of KS (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the KS-containing fragments showed no change in mobility upon chondroitinase treatment (Fig. 5B), suggesting that KS and CS do not occur on the same peptide. As expected, both keratanase and endo-β-galactosidase abolished KS immunoreactivity. To further verify the unique migration of the CS1 domain and keratan sulfate, the trypsin-generated aggrecan fragments were fractionated according to their size by gel filtration chromatography through Sepharose CL-4B. A bimodal profile was observed upon analysis of the column fractions for GAG content (Fig. 6A). Immunoblotting revealed that the CS1 domain was present in only the less retarded pool (Fig. 6B) and was distinct from the KS-containing fragments, which were more retarded (Fig. 6C). In addition, the trypsin-generated fragments were also analyzed by ion exchange chromatography through DEAE-Sephacel. GAG analysis via the DMMB dye binding assay revealed that elution was mainly in one peak with a trailing edge (Fig. 7A). Toluidine blue staining of the fragments in the fractions following agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the fastest and slowest migrating component were present in the major peak (Fig. 7B), with the slowest migrating component representing the CS1 domain (Fig. 7C). In contrast, all the KS-containing fragments were present in the trailing edge (Fig. 7D). Thus, it appears that trypsin generates aggrecan fragments that contain either CS or KS but not both GAGs.FIGURE 7Ion exchange analysis of trypsin digests of aggrecan. Aggrecan from a 22-year-old individual was digested with trypsin and then analyzed by ion exchange chromatography through DEAE-Sephacel. Fractions were analyzed for glycosaminoglycan-containing components using the DMMB dye binding assay (A). Selected fractions were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by direct staining with toluidine blue (B) or immunoblotting with anti-CS1 domain (C) or anti-KS (D) antibodies.

As expected, the ratio of 6-sulfated to 4-sulfated disaccharides increased with age. There was, however, no change in this ratio in the larger pool containing the CS1 domain and that in the smaller pool containing the CS2 fragments derived from the same aggrecan preparation. Differences were noted in the sulfation pattern of N-acetyl galactosamine residues at the non-reducing terminus of the CS chains. Although the CS1 domains always contained 4-sufation exclusively, the CS2 domains derived from adult aggrecan also contained 4,6-disulfation. With the exception of the newborn, it was also apparent that CS chain length was lower in the fragments derived from the CS2 domain than those derived from the CS1 domain.TABLE 1Chondroitin sulfate fine structural composition of aggrecan subdomains0 years3 years22 years64 yearsCS1aCS1 and CS2 fragments resolved on Sepharose CL-4B.CS2CS1CS2CS1CS2CS1CS2GlcA-GalNAc6S (%)bProportion of disaccharide repeats per CS chain.42 ± 2cValues represent standard deviation of three separate analyses on each sample.43 ± 443 ± 344 ± 586 ± 586 ± 586 ± 285 ± 7GlcA-GalNAc4S (%)bProportion of disaccharide repeats per CS chain.58 ± 257 ± 257 ± 256 ± 214 ± 214 ± 214 ± 215 ± 2Disacc:chaindNumber of disaccharide residues per CS chain.33 ± 237 ± 230 ± 322 ± 134 ± 419 ± 219 ± 114 ± 1GalNAc4S (%)eProportion of non-reducing terminal GalNAc residues per CS chains.10010010010010078 ± 410011 ± 1GalNAc4,6diS (%)eProportion of non-reducing terminal GalNAc residues per CS chains.NDfND = not detected.NDNDNDND22 ± 5ND89 ± 3a CS1 and CS2 fragments resolved on Sepharose CL-4B.b Proportion of disaccharide repeats per CS chain.c Values represent standard deviation of three separate analyses on each sample.d Number of disaccharide residues per CS chain.e Proportion of non-reducing terminal GalNAc residues per CS chains.f ND = not detected. Open table in a new tab The KS chains present in the two Sepharose CL-4B pools were also analyzed for composition changes with age following keratanase and endo-β-galactosidase digestion (Table 2). However, in this case, the GAG chains are not on CS1- or CS2-derived fragments and probably represent different sized fragments derived mainly from the KS-rich domain. In both juvenile and adult specimens, the major disaccharide was 6-sulfated on the N-acetyl glucosamine residues with a minor proportion also possessing fucose substituted on the N-acetyl glucosamine residues. The remainder of the disaccharides (about 30–40%) were disulfated, possessing 6-sulfation on both the galactose and the N-acetyl glucosamine residues. This composition is similar to that present in corneal keratan sulfate and accounts for the immunoreactivity of the KS chains. The number of disaccharides to sialic acid, an indicator of KS chain length, was, however, smaller in the cartilage KS chains.TABLE 2Keratan sulfate fine structural composition of cartilage aggrecanCorneaaCorneal keratan sulfate purchased from Sigma.CartilageAdultJuvenileKS1bKeratan sulfate-rich fragments of large (KS1) and small (KS2) size.KS2KS1KS2Gal-GlcNAc (%)cProportion of disaccharide repeats per KS chain.NDdND = not detected.NDNDNDNDGal-GlcNAc6S (%)cProportion of disaccharide repeats per KS chain.71 ± 4eValues represent standard deviation of three separate analyses on each sample.61 ± 252 ± 258 ± 256 ± 1Gal-GlcNAc6S(Fuc) (%)cProportion of disaccharide repeats per KS chain.ND9 ± 115 ± 2ND9 ± 2Gal6S-GlcNAc6S (%)cProportion of disaccharide repeats per KS chain.29 ± 230 ± 433 ± 642 ± 335 ± 4Disacc:SAfNumber of disaccharide residues per sialic acid residue.18 ± 39 ± 27 ± 19 ± 25 ± 1a Corneal keratan sulfate purchased from Sigma.b Keratan sulfate-rich fragments of large (KS1) and small (KS2) size.c Proportion of disaccharide repeats per KS chain.d ND = not detected.e Values represent standard deviation of three separate analyses on each sample.f Number of disaccharide residues per sialic acid residue. Open table in a new tab The present results demonstrate that trypsin digestion of human aggrecan generates fragments that possess either CS or KS but not both GAGs. The ability to isolate the CS1 domain of aggrecan in an intact state allows its separation from all other fragments by virtue of its larger size, and this enables its deficiency in KS to be conclusively established. With respect to the CS2 domain, the deficiency in KS cannot be proven categorically as it is not possible to isolate this domain in an intact state. One could argue that CS and KS chains are present within the CS2 domain but at discrete sites that just happen to be separated by trypsin cleavage sites. This is, however, an extremely improbable scenario based on the amino acid sequence of the CS2 domain (6Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is most likely that the majority of KS chains within the GAG-attachment region of aggrecan are confined to the KS-rich domain. Such a scenario has previously been suggested to occur in aggrecan derived from chick cartilage (26Krueger R.C. Fields Jr., T.A. Hildreth J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12075-12087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KS chains may also be present in the G1, interglobular domain, and G2 regions (27Barry F.P. Gaw J.U. Young C.N. Neame P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Barry F.P. Rosenberg L.C. Gaw J.U. Koob T.J. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20516-20524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The results also imply that there are no CS chains within the KS-rich domain. Thus, it would appear that the bulk of the increase in KS associated with increasing age in cartilage aggrecan is due to a combination of increased substitution within the KS-rich domain and proteolytic processing decreasing the size of the CS2 domain. Although KS appears to be absent from the human aggrecan CS1 and CS2 domains, it is not clear that CS represents the only type of glycosylation that is present. It is known that aggrecan is substituted with O-linked oligosaccharide chains that resemble the linkage region through which KS is attached to serine or threonine residues on the core protein (4Nilsson B. De Luca S. Lohmander S. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10920-10927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that with increasing age, some O-linked oligosaccharides are replaced by keratan sulfate to give an increased core protein substitution (29Santer V. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 716: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Presumably, such O-linked oligosaccharides are located within the KS-rich domain, but one cannot unequivocally exclude their presence also in the CS1 or CS2 domains. It is interesting to note that CS chain termination and length can vary between the CS1- and CS2-derived trypsin fragments in the same aggrecan preparation, particularly in the adult. This raises the question of whether CS chains on an individual aggrecan molecule are different. As CS chain composition varies with age, one factor that could potentially influence the analysis of CS structure is the increased proteolytic processing of the CS2 domain that takes place throughout life (30Roughley P.J. Alini M. Antoniou J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Such processing results in the loss of CS2-derived fragments from the cartilage, and hence, the CS2 trypsin-generated fragments studied in this work might be expected to possess a greater contribution from the more intact proteoglycans synthesized later in life. One would then predict that CS within the CS2 fragments should contain an increased 6:4-sulfation ratio relative to CS in the CS1 domain. This, however, was not the case. In addition, proteolytic processing cannot account for the observed variation in CS chain termination. Thus, on a given aggrecan molecule, the CS chains in the CS2 domain may indeed be structurally distinct from those in the CS1 domain. This being the case, the CS chains in the CS2 domain may also be immunologically distinct from those in the CS1 domain and behave differently in immunoassays of aggrecan fragments that are based on CS epitopes (31Plaas A.H.K.

Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 411-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CS1 domain of human aggrecan shows size polymorphism due to variability in the number of adjacent 19-amino acid repeats (14Doege K.J. Coulter S.N. Meek L.M. Maslen K. Wood J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13974-13979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this may be of functional consequence due to variation in the number of CS chains that may be present on aggrecan molecules. Aggrecan molecules possessing the longer CS1 domains would possess an increased fixed change density and presumably enhanced osmotic properties. One might therefore predict that tissue possessing aggrecan with shorter CS1 domains may be functionally inferior and more susceptible to degeneration, and such an association has been reported (34Horton W.E. Lethbridge-Çejku Jr., M. Hochberg Balakir M.C. Precht R. Plato P. Tobin C.C. Meek J.D. L. Doege K. Osteoarthritis Cart. 1998; 6: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Kawaguchi Y. Osada R. Kanamori M. Ishihara H. Ohmori K. Matsui H. Kimura T.

From the present work, it is apparent that the variation in CS1 size is not due to a single mechanism in which repeat variation occurs at a common site, such as within the long central subdomain. It is apparent that repeat deletion or insertion may occur throughout the CS1 domain so that individuals with the same number of CS1 repeats may have different CS1 amino acid sequences. It remains to be established whether such amino acid sequence variation is of any functional consequence in relation to altered immunogenicity. Finally, one must consider whether the results obtained with human aggrecan also apply to other species. With respect to CS1 size polymorphism, there is no evidence to date for its occurrence in any other species, and hence, its functional relevance, if any, may be confined to the human. It is interesting to speculate whether an increase in CS1 domain length might be an evolutionary response to bipedalism as an adaptation to provide more functional aggrecan to resist increased loading in weight-bearing cartilages, although such a relationship awaits biomechanical validation. With respect to GAG distribution, it is not possible to perform similar analyses in other species as the human is unique in its absence of lysine and arginine residues within the CS1 domain. Hence, this domain cannot be isolated in an intact state from other species and so separated from trypsin-derived KS domain and CS2 domain fragments. However, there are data in the literature from clostripain digestion of chick aggrecan suggesting that KS occurs in a unique region of the core protein (26Krueger R.C. Fields Jr., T.A. Hildreth J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12075-12087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with the present work. There are also data suggesting that some fragments derived from trypsin digestion of bovine aggrecan may possess both KS and CS on the same peptide (12Heinegard D. Axelsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1971-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Heinegard D. Hascall V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that some KS is present within the CS1 and/or CS2 domains. This may represent a true species difference, or it could relate to the identification of KS by glucosamine analysis, which cannot distinguish KS from O-linked oligosaccharides. Thus, these data may provide evidence that O-linked oligosaccharides are present within the CS-rich domains of aggrecan."

The maintenance of peroxisome function depends on the formation of the peroxisomal membrane and the subsequent import of both membrane and matrix proteins. The matrix protein import occurs in a post-translational manner (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) and uses either one of the two well characterized peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 or PTS2, that are recognized and bound by specific receptor proteins Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively. Subsequently, the receptor-cargo complexes dock to distinct proteins accessible at the cis-side of the peroxisomal membrane. Pex13p and Pex14p physically bind both import receptors Pex5p and Pex7p, whereas Pex14p also interacts with Pex17p (2Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M.

According to the widely accepted model of cycling receptors, the receptor-cargo complex is supposed to dissociate at the peroxisomal membrane in an entirely unknown manner, resulting in the sorting of the cargo protein to the peroxisomal matrix and the release of free receptors to the cytosol, where they are available for another round of import (13Dodt G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4908-4918Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast to the increasing knowledge on the peroxisomal matrix protein import, our understanding of the topogenesis of peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ProtA, protein A; TEV, tobacco etch virus. is rather scarce. Most of the mutants lacking one of the known peroxins are characterized by a severe defect in matrix protein import, whereas the targeting of peroxisomal membrane proteins is not affected, indicated by the presence of peroxisomal remnant structures that contain a number of PMPs but no or only residual amounts of matrix proteins (15Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Small G.M. Lazarow P.B. Science. 1988; 239: 1536-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These and other findings led to the conclusion that PMP targeting occurs independently of the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins (5Erdmann R. Blobel G. J.

Among the 32 known proteins involved in peroxisome biogenesis, only Pex3p, Pex16p, and Pex19p are required for the biogenesis of the peroxisomal membrane. Cells lacking either a functional copy of PEX3, PEX16,or PEX19 contain neither peroxisomes nor obvious peroxisomal remnants (for review, see Ref. 16Sparkes I.A. Baker A. Mol. Membr.

The observation that most PMPs are recognized by Pex19p triggered the idea that this predominantly cytosolic protein might function as a chaperone and/or import receptor for peroxisomal membrane proteins (17Hettema E.H.

Biol. 2004; 14: R397-R399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PMPs use neither one of the two targeting signals, PTS1 and PTS2, that direct proteins to the peroxisomal matrix (for review, see Ref. 16Sparkes I.A. Baker A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The targeting signal for peroxisomal membrane proteins (mPTS) has been identified for several proteins, including Pmp47p of Candida boidini, Pmp34p, Pmp22p from mammals, and Pex3p from various species (21Pause B.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In support of an import receptor function of Pex19p, most PMPs contain conserved binding sites for Pex19p that share a common motif that is essential and in conjunction with a transmembrane segment sufficient for peroxisomal targeting and membrane insertion (28Rottensteiner H. Kramer A. Lorenzen S. Stein K. Landgraf C. Volkmer-Engert R. Erdmann R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 7: 3406-3417Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the peroxisomal targeting and membrane association of Pex17p, a peripheral component of the docking complex of the peroxisomal protein import machinery. We have defined the binding regions of Pex17p for other peroxins and demonstrated that the peroxisomal targeting and stability of Pex17p requires Pex19p as a chaperone or import receptor as well as Pex14p for a stable anchoring at the peroxisomal membrane.

Cells were harvested and aliquots of 30 mg of cells were resuspended in 300 μlof potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were frozen at -80 °C for at least 30 min. Samples were sedimented, washed twice with ice-cold 50% acetone, and resuspended in 80 μl of 10% SDS/0.1 m NaOH and 20 μl of SDS loading buffer (5% β-mercaptoethanol, 15% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Two-hybrid Analysis—The two-hybrid assay was based on the method of Fields and Song (34Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4860) Google Scholar). Open reading frames were fused to the DNA-binding domain or trans-activating domain of GAL4 in the vectors pPC86 and pPC97 (35Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To generate PEX17 and PEX17I80P constructs in pPC97, PEX17 fragments were amplified by PCR using pPC97-PEX17 (7Huhse B. Rehling P. Albertini M. Blank L. Meller K. Kunau W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or pLH9 as a template. The PCR fragments were first cloned into EcoRI/SacI-prepared pPC86 and subsequently into SalI/SacI-digested pPC97. Co-transformation of two-hybrid vectors into strain PCY2 was performed according to Gietz and Woods (36Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 121-134Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were plated onto SD medium without tryptophan and leucine. β-Galactosidase filter assays were performed according to Rehling et al. (37Rehling P. Marzioch M. Niesen F. Wittke E. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2901-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—For in vitro binding of Pex17p to Pex14p, the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and MBP-Pex17p of soluble fractions obtained from pMal-C2- and pMal-PEX17-transformed Escherichia coli Bl21, respectively, were bound for 2 h at 4°C to amylose resin (New England Biolabs). After washing of the matrix with buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), the soluble fractions of bacteria-expressed Pex14pHis6 were added and incubated with the matrix for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. After washing the matrix with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The eluted samples were analyzed by immunoblot analysis.

Immunoreactive complexes were visualized using anti-rabbit IgG-coupled horseradish peroxidase in combination with the ECL™ system from Amersham Biosciences. Miscellaneous Methods—Analysis of live cells for DsRed and GFP fluorescence was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope and Axio-Vision version 4.1 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunopurification of native complexes using hsIgG-coupled Sepharose was performed as described previously (42Agne B. Meindl N.M. Niederhoff K. Einwächter H. Rehling P. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E.

Genomically Tagged Pex17p-Protein A (ProtA) Is Functional—To isolate and characterize Pex17p, we constructed strains expressing this peroxin fused to two IgG-binding domains derived from Staphylococcus aureus ProtA, with a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease inserted between Pex17p and the ProtA tag (29Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The corresponding wild-type strain was initially tested for growth on plates containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source, which will support cell growth only if peroxisomal β-oxidation is functional. The pex17Δ strain was unable to grow on this medium in line with previous findings (7Huhse B. Rehling P. Albertini M. Blank L. Meller K. Kunau W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and typical for peroxisomal mutant strains of S. cerevisiae (31Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5419-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The genomically tagged wild-type strain expressing Pex17p-ProtA grew at a rate indistinguishable from the corresponding non-tagged wild type (Fig. 1A). These data are corroborated by electron microscopic analysis of the ultrastructure of the cells. pex17Δ cells are characterized by the mislocalization of peroxisomal matrix proteins to the cytosol, which leads to the absence of morphologically detectable peroxisomes, whereas the strain harboring the ProtA-tagged Pex17p was indistinguishable from the wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). Thus, the genomic tagging did neither interfere with the growth behavior of the cells on oleic acid medium nor with the morphological appearance of peroxisomes, indicating that the TEV-ProtA-tagged Pex17p is functional in vivo. Steady State Level of Pex17p in pex Mutants—Previous studies have demonstrated that, in cells lacking either Pex3p or Pex19p, the levels of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins that rely on these PMPs are strongly reduced (17Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van Den Berg M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 43Otzen M. Perband U. Wang D. Baerends R.J. Kunau W.H.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the membrane-associated Pex17p is also subjected to a rapid turnover in these mutant cells, we determined the steady-state level of Pex17p-ProtA in pex3Δ and pex19Δ as well as pex12Δ cells, a mutant strain which is defective only in matrix protein import, whereas the membrane protein transport remains unaffected (38Albertini M. Girzalsky W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown on oleic acid-containing medium, and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Samples were probed for the presence of Pex17p, its binding partner Pex14p (2Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as an internal control (Fig. 2A). In pex12Δ cells, the Pex17p-ProtA steady-state level was the same as in the wild-type cells. Remarkably, the protein abundance of Pex17p was drastically decreased in strains deficient in either PEX3 or PEX19, whereas the steady-state level of Pex14p, a membrane-associated protein (2Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A.K.W. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 3Brocard C. Lametschwandtner G. Koudelka R. Hartig A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5491-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was not affected (Fig. 2A). Thus, the lower Pex17p concentration is not due to a lack of Pex14p, the deficiency of which has been demonstrated to cause Pex17p instability in Pichia pastoris (46Harper C.C. South S. McCaffery J.M. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16498-16504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the instability of Pex17p in these mutants reflects the behavior of an integral membrane protein. As there is no doubt that Pex17p is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with the peroxisomal membrane by binding to Pex14p, these data establish that not only the stability of integral PMPs but also of the membrane-associated Pex17p depends on proteins, which have been shown to be essential for proper targeting of integral peroxisomal membrane proteins. Both Pex14p and Pex19p Are Part of Pex17p Complexes—The reduced level of Pex17p in cells lacking Pex19p tempted us to analyze whether both proteins are associated in vivo, as previously reported for P. pastoris (9Snyder W.B. Koller A. Choy A.J. Johnson M.A. Cregg J.M. Rangell L. Keller G.A. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4005-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We performed IgG affinity chromatography with the ProtA-tagged Pex17p as bait to identify associated protein components. Total cell membranes were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to affinity purification. Pex17p and bound proteins were eluted by cleavage with the TEV protease. Wild-type cells expressing no ProtA fusion served as the control. Aliquots of the TEV protease eluates, representing equal amounts of total membranes from each strain, were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Pex13p and Pex14p, two docking complex constituents (12Subramani S. Koller A. Snyder W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 2000: 399-418Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 47Holroyd C. Erdmann R.

The specificity of the isolation procedure is documented by the absence of the prominent peroxisomal membrane protein Pex11p (50Erdmann R. Blobel G. J.

Biol. 2001; 36: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in the eluates and the complete depletion of Pex17p-ProtA from the detergent extract upon incubation with IgG-Sepharose. These data corroborate that Pex17p belongs to the docking complex of the peroxisomal protein import machinery. To determine whether the observed Pex17p interactions with Pex14p are mediated by one of the components identified in the in vivo complex or whether they represent direct protein/protein interactions, in vitro binding assays were performed. MBP and chimeric MBP-Pex17p were immobilized on amylose resin and incubated with lysates containing Pex14p fused to a hexahistidyl tag. As shown in Fig. 3, Pex14pHis6 only bound to the column when the matrices were loaded with MBP-Pex17p, whereas binding to the MBP control was not observed. Interestingly, the same was true for recombinant GST-Pex19p, which was exclusively recovered from the column loaded with MBP-Pex17p, although the amount of Pex19p bound to Pex17p was only just above the detection level (data not shown). Nevertheless, the data support the idea of a specific interaction of Pex17p and Pex19p. In line with this assumption, a small but significant amount of Pex19p was pulled down by Pex17p in vivo. From these findings, we conclude that Pex17p interacts with both Pex14p and Pex19p in a direct manner. Distinct Binding Sites of Pex17p for Pex14p and Pex19p—We used the two-hybrid system to identify the regions within Pex17p that contribute to the association with Pex14p and Pex19p.

https://openalex.org/W1983786920,"The three Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, contain a large cytoplasmic loop that is responsible for the regulation of activity. We have used 347 residues of the loop of NCX2 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify proteins that could interact with the exchanger and regulate its activity. Screening of a human brain cDNA library identified the epsilon and zeta isoforms of the 14-3-3 protein family as interacting partners of the exchanger. The interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding experiments. The effect of the interaction on the homeostasis of Ca2+ was investigated by co-expressing NCX2 and 14-3-3epsilon in HeLa cells together with the recombinant Ca2+ probe aequorin; the ability of cells expressing both NCX2 and 14-3-3epsilon to dispose of a Ca2+ transient induced by an InsP3-producing agonist was substantially decreased, indicating a reduction of NCX2 activity. The 14-3-3epsilon protein also inhibited the NCX1 and NCX3 isoforms. In vitro binding experiments revealed that all three NCX isoforms interacted with multiple 14-3-3 isoforms. 14-3-3 was bound by both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated NCX, but the phosphorylated form had much higher binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2101691767,"The remarkably wide dynamic range of the chemotactic pathway of Escherichia coli, a model signal transduction system, is achieved by methylation/amidation of the transmembrane chemoreceptors that regulate the histidine kinase CheA in response to extracellular stimuli. The chemoreceptors cluster at a cell pole together with CheA and the adaptor CheW. Several lines of evidence have led to models that assume high cooperativity and sensitivity via collaboration of receptor dimers within a cluster. Here, using in vivo disulfide cross-linking assays, we have demonstrated a well defined arrangement of the aspartate chemoreceptor (Tar). The differential effects of amidation on cross-linking at different positions indicate that amidation alters the relative orientation of Tar dimers to each other (presumably inducing rotational displacements) without much affecting the conformation of the periplasmic domains. Interestingly, the effect of aspartate on cross-linking at any position tested was roughly opposite to that of receptor amidation. Furthermore, amidation attenuated the effects of aspartate by several orders of magnitude. These results suggest that receptor covalent modification controls signal gain by altering the arrangement or packing of receptor dimers in a pre-formed cluster.

This displacement is thought to trigger a structural change in the cytoplasmic domain, which then inactivates CheA. To account for high sensitivity of the chemotaxis system, however, it has been proposed that attractant binding also affects neighboring receptor dimer(s) (18Bray D. Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J.

Receptor clustering has also been implicated in signal gain control by methylation (or amidation) of specific glutamate residues that is responsible for adaptation to persisting stimuli. A slight decrease in the attractant binding affinity (27Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A.

Rather, receptor methylation/amidation seems to control signal gain, presumably through receptor clustering (21Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Nature. 2004; 428: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 23Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, receptor methylation/amidation does not drastically alter the polar localization of the high abundance chemoreceptors (31Liberman L. Berg H.C. Sourjik V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6643-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Lybarger S.R. Nair U. Lilly A.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Maddock J.R. Mol.

We have already established, by using a site-directed disulfide cross-linking assay, that receptor dimers interact with each other in vivo and that this interaction is modulated by attractant binding (26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we employed this technique to ask whether receptor clustering is involved in gain control. Systematic disulfide scanning revealed a well defined array of receptor dimers. Cross-linking at different positions was affected differentially by receptor amidation (equivalent to methylation), suggesting that receptor amidation alters relative orientation of receptor dimers in the cluster rather than inducing their association or dissociation. In any position tested, attractant binding showed effects roughly opposite to amidation, but these attractant effects were attenuated by increasing levels of amidation. These results suggest that receptor amidation (methylation) controls signal gain by altering the arrangement or packing of receptor dimers in a pre-formed cluster. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Strain HCB339 (34Wolfe A.J. Conley M.P. Kramer T.J. Berg H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1878-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) lacks all four chemoreceptors, whereas strain HCB436 (35Wolfe A.J. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) lacks all four chemoreceptors, CheB, and CheR. All Tar-encoding plasmids used for the cross-linking assays were derived from pWSK29 (36Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene. 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), a derivative of pSC101 that carries the bla gene. Site-directed mutagenesis of tar was carried out essentially as described previously (26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Swarm Assay of Chemotaxis—Swarm assays were performed with tryptone semisolid agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.3% agar) supplemented with 50 mg/ml of ampicillin. After swarm plates were inoculated with fresh colonies, they were incubated at 30 °C for 10-20 h. In some experiments, cell suspensions were spotted onto a plate, which was then incubated at 30 °C for 8-9 h. In Vivo Disulfide Cross-linking—Disulfide cross-linking and immunoblotting were essentially as described previously (26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). TG broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) glycerol) supplemented with 50 mg/ml of ampicillin was inoculated at 1:30 dilution with a fresh overnight culture of cells carrying a plasmid. Cultures were then shaken at 30 °C. After 3.5 h, cells were harvested and suspended in SDS loading buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6.7% glycerol, 1% SDS, 0.0007% bromophenol blue) supplemented with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 2.5 mm EDTA. When necessary, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the final concentration of 12.5%. Samples were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Biocraft, Tokyo). The antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide (NH2-(C)PRLRIAEQDPN-WETF-COOH) of Tar was prepared by Sawadi Technology Co. (Tokyo). The horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was used as the second antibody. The protein-antibody complexes were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). To quantify the intensity of the Tar band, the immunoblots were scanned and the resulting images were analyzed by using the software ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The cross-linking efficiency (in percentage) of a given Tar mutant protein was defined as a proportion of the cross-linked dimers to the total amount. For each mutant, cross-linking assays were triplicated with three independent transformants, and the mean and standard deviation values ware calculated. To examine the effects of an attractant on disulfide cross-linking, cells were grown for 3.5 h as described above, washed twice with EDTA-free MLM medium (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm dl-lactate, 0.1 mm methionine), resuspended in EDTA-free MLM, and divided into aliquots. α-Methyl-dl-aspartate (MeAsp) 3The abbreviations used are: MeAsp, α-methyl-dl-aspartate; Cu-phenanthroline, Cu(II)(o-phenanthroline)3. (0-10-3 m) was added to each aliquot. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature or at 30 °C before being treated with an oxidizing catalyst Cu(II)(o-phenanthroline)3 (hereafter referred to as Cu-phenanthroline) (0-200 μm) supplemented with MeAsp (0-10-3 m) for 10 min at room temperature or at 30 °C. To stop the oxidation reaction, 1/5 volume of prechilled stop solution (210 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide) supplemented with MeAsp (0-10-3 m) was added to the samples, and then samples were put on ice. Cells were collected and suspended in SDS loading buffer containing 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide and 2.5 mm EDTA supplemented with MeAsp (0-10-3 m). When necessary, 2-mercaptoethanol was added. Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Receptor Dimers Are Organized into a Well Defined Array—To probe the relative orientation of receptor dimers in a polar cluster, we systematically introduced Cys residues within or near loop 2-3 of the periplasmic domain of the aspartate chemoreceptor Tar (Fig. 1). The loop sticks out from the dimer in the crystal and might constitute an interdimer contact surface. The resulting proteins were expressed in HCB339 cells, which lack all receptors, at levels similar to that of chromosome-encoded wild-type Tar (data not shown). Cells expressing any mutant Tar except Tar-A118C, which caused growth retardation, swarmed as fast as those expressing wild-type Tar (data not shown), indicating that the Cys substitutions, except A118C, by themselves do not severely affect receptor function. To avoid any complexity from covalent modification, the mutant proteins were then expressed in HCB436 cells, which lack all receptors, the methylesterase CheB, and the methyltransferase CheR. Immunoblotting revealed that all of them formed cross-linked dimers in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline in vivo (data not shown), which are deduced to result from cross-linking between native dimers because the double mutants with S36C (located at the subunit interface within a dimer) yielded cross-linked oligomers in the presence of Cu-phenanthroline (data not shown). In the absence of Cu-phenanthroline, the cross-linking efficiencies at positions in helix 3 (A118C-I123C) exhibited a periodicity that is consistent with the water accessibility of an α-helix packed against the rest of the protein (12Milburn M.V. Prive G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jacarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 37Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Prive G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and C). The variation of the mobility of the dimers on the SDS-PAGE gels should be due to their shape: the closer the cross-linking point to the midpoint of the molecule, the more slowly the cross-linked dimer would migrate in the gel matrix. Along with the dependence of inter-dimer cross-linking on the presence of CheA and CheW (data not shown and Ref. 26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this pattern supports the idea that the in vivo interdimer cross-linking of Tar reflects its native structure. The Cys residues in the C-terminal half of loop 2-3 (P114C-V117C) were more apt to be cross-linked than those in the N-terminal half (K108C-L113C), indicating that in the receptor clusters the former positions are more closely located to each other. A very high cross-linking efficiency at position 118 might account for the failure of the A118C protein to support swarming of HCB339 cells. When combined with the S36C mutation, all of the resulting double Cys mutant proteins yielded cross-linked oligomers as has been shown for the S36C/D142C protein (26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), demonstrating that all these disulfides in or near the loop cross-link subunits from different dimers. Prolonged incubation of the double Cys mutant protein S36C/D142C with Cu-phenanthroline resulted in accumulation of the deduced hexamer over the other oligomers (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the S36C/M116C protein did not exhibit such a pattern. On the basis of the efficiencies of cross-linking and the assumption of a “trimer of dimers” unit (24Ames P. Studdert C.A. Reiser R.H. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7060-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H.

A. 2002; 99: 11611-11615Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we propose a relative arrangement of three Tar dimers in a receptor array (Fig. 3). This model, albeit being only qualitative without precise distance and orientation, can predict the differential patterns of cross-linked oligomers. The S36C/D142C protein would allow the formation of disulfide bonds between all six subunits in the model, whereas the S36C/M116C protein cannot form a cross-linked hexamer: only two Cys residues of the three “inner” subunits can be cross-linked. Differential Effects of Receptor Amidation on Cross-linking at Various Positions—To examine the effect of covalent modification on the arrangement of receptor dimers in a cluster, we introduced mutations into the four methylation sites, Gln-295, Glu-302, Gln-309, and Glu-491 (collectively referred to as QEQE), of each Cys-replaced Tar to yield three amidation states: fully deamidated (EEEE), intermediate (QEQE), and fully amidated (QQQQ) (Fig. 1). It has been established that a Gln residue mimics a methylated Glu residue (27Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and that receptor methylation (amidation) increases the mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE. The representative gel is shown in Fig. 4, demonstrating that amidation has different effects on cross-linking at different positions. It should be noted that both the concentration of Cu-phenanthroline and the amount of protein were optimized for each Cys position to detect differences among the differentially amidated variants. The assay was triplicated and the cross-linking efficiencies were quantified (Fig. 4B). The Cys residues showed different patterns, which can be divided into three classes: the efficiency of cross-linking at a given position was highest at the (i) QQQQ, (ii) EEEE, or (iii) QEQE state, whereas cross-linking at S36C was not detectably changed. The results are summarized by colorcoded positions in the three-dimensional structure of Tar (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Classification of the Cys positions with respect to the differential effects of receptor amidation on Cys cross-linking. The Cys residues were placed onto the three-dimensional structure and divided into three classes. The efficiency of cross-linking at a given position was highest when the amidation state of the protein was QQQQ (red), EEEE (blue), or QEQE (magenta). Cross-linking at position 36 (yellow) was not detectably changed by amidation. The P114C and V117C proteins formed two dimer bands, and the positions of the Cys residues have been marked with pink balls. Left top panel, top view; left bottom panel, bottom view; right panel, side view.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The positions showing similar effects of methylation (class i, ii, or iii) tend to cluster in the three-dimensional structure, lining up along the long axis (Fig. 5). Because efficiency of disulfide formation at a given position is highly sensitive to the distance between two thiol groups, the simplest model to account for the pattern may be that receptor amidation (methylation) induces slight rotational movement of Tar dimers either around the axis of symmetry of the dimer (Fig. 6A) or the trimer of dimers (Fig. 6B). Because receptor methylation does not affect cross-linking at the cytoplasmic trimer contact (25Studdert C.A. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2117-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is necessary to assume a twist at somewhere between the cytoplasmic trimer contact and the transmembrane region in the former model. Such a twist might occur within the structurally undefined HAMP domain that connects the second transmembrane to the first methylation helix. The latter model does not require any twist within a dimer but involves a larger movement. Effects of Attractant Binding Oppose Those of Amidation—We also examined the effect of MeAsp, a non-metabolizable analog of aspartate, on interdimer cross-linking. It has already been shown that MeAsp does not affect intradimer cross-linking at S36C but decreases inter- dimer cross-linking at D142C without any detectable change in receptor localization (26Homma M. Shiomi D. Homma M. Kawagishi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3462-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although on a longer time scale the addition of an attractant decreases receptor localization (41Inoue I. Shiomi D. Kawagishi I. Yasuda K. J. Nanobiotechnology. 2004; 2: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found that MeAsp either increases (S109C and P112C) or decreases (N122C) interdimer cross-linking depending on the position of the introduced Cys (Fig. 7). For any mutant tested, the effect of MeAsp on cross-linking was roughly opposite to that of receptor methylation. The reciprocal effects of attractant and methylation are consistent with previous two-state models of receptor signaling and adaptation (42Asakura S. Honda H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 349-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 43Barkai N. Leibler S. Nature. 1997; 387: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar, 44Morton-Firth C.J. Shimizu T.S. Bray D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1059-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Bornhorst J.A. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1597-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Receptor Amidation Attenuated Attractant Effects on Cross-linking—To examine whether the dimer-to-dimer interaction of Tar is involved in gain control by covalent modification, we examined the effect of the MeAsp concentration on interdimer cross-linking. The representative results are shown in Fig. 8. In this assay, variations were too high to quantify the cross-linking efficiencies, but the results were qualitatively reproducible. For N122C, the threshold concentration of MeAsp for decreasing cross-linking of the EEEE form was at least 103-fold higher than that for the QQQQ form. Similar results were obtained for D142C (data not shown). By contrast, the EEEE form of the P112C mutant was cross-linked even in the absence of MeAsp at an efficiency similar to that in the presence of saturating concentrations of MeAsp, presumably because the fully demethylated state mimics attractant binding at least to some extent, whereas cross-linking of the QQQQ form was increased only in the presence of 1 mm MeAsp. Similar results were obtained for S109C (data not shown). Thus, the aspartate effects (regardless of polarity) on interdimer cross-linking are attenuated by covalent modification (amidation) of Tar, suggesting that gain control by covalent modification of the chemoreceptor involves modulation of arrangement or packing of the receptor array. The structures of the intact chemoreceptors, the intact kinase CheA, and their complex with the adaptor CheW remain unresolved, which has impeded understanding of the mechanisms of signaling through the chemoreceptor-CheW-CheA cluster. The systematic disulfide cross-linking assays presented in this study have led to the following key findings about chemoreceptor clustering and its physiological significance: (i) chemoreceptor dimers are organized into a well defined array in E. coli cells; (ii) receptor amidation and attractant binding have roughly opposite effects on the arrangement, packing, and/or dynamics of receptor dimers within the array; and (iii) increasing levels of amidation attenuate effects of attractant binding, hence presumably decreasing signal gain (Fig. 9). In essence, the receptor array is in an equilibrium between the kinase ON and OFF states, which are favored by methylation (amidation) and attractant binding, respectively. We propose that receptor methylation controls signal gain by rearranging receptor dimers (e.g. inducing a small rotational displacement) with a polarity opposite to attractant binding and restricting the attractant-induced rearrangement of receptor dimers. It has recently been shown that receptor methylation (amidation) slightly increases its polar localization (31Liberman L. Berg H.C. Sourjik V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6643-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Lybarger S.R. Nair U. Lilly A.A. Hazelbauer G.L. Maddock J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1078-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Shiomi D. Banno S. Homma M. Kawagishi I. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7647-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although such a small increase cannot account for adaptation, amidation would enhance interdimer cross-linking at all positions. The differential effects on cross-linking at various positions argue that enhanced localization or clustering is not a major effect of receptor amidation but that it alters the arrangement or packing of dimers within a preformed cluster. By contrast, cross-linking of receptor dimers at the cytoplasmic “trimer contact” is not affected by receptor amidation or even by the presence or absence of CheA and CheW (24Ames P. Studdert C.A. Reiser R.H. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7060-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 25Studdert C.A. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2117-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We therefore suspect that the proposed arrangement (Fig. 3) represents three dimers from neighboring trimer of dimers units rather than from within a single unit, which is consistent with previous models that assume a well defined receptor array (40Kim S.H. Wang W. Kim K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11611-11615Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Methylation may also modulate structural dynamics of the receptor. In fact, the addition of MeAsp induced little change in cross-linking of the EEEE forms of the S109C and P112C proteins. This result is consistent with the suggestion that the unmodified chemoreceptor is more dynamic than the amidated one (40Kim S.H. Wang W. Kim K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11611-11615Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how the rearrangement of receptor dimers can regulate the CheA kinase activity. Nevertheless, our results shed new light on the significance of receptor clustering or receptor quaternary structures in signal transduction. Moreover, the cross-linking technique may be applied to isolate receptor oligomers or larger clusters for structural studies. We thank Toshiharu Yakushi for helpful discussion and encouragement.

https://openalex.org/W2000771665,"Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor and tumor suppressor that can regulate gene expression in a manner requiring either its sequence specific DNA binding activity or its ability to bind the p300 coactivator. We show that IRF-1-mediated growth inhibition is dependent on the integrity of a C-terminal transcriptional enhancer domain. An enhancer subdomain (amino acids 301-325) that differentially regulates IRF-1 activity has been identified and this region mediates the repression of Cdk2. The repressor domain encompasses an LXXLL coregulator signature motif and mutations or deletions within this region completely uncouple transcriptional activation from repression. The loss of growth suppressor activity when the Cdk2-repressor domain of IRF-1 is mutated implicates repression as a determinant of its maximal growth inhibitory potential. The data link IRF-1 regulatory domains to its growth inhibitory activity and provide information about how differential gene regulation may contribute to IRF-1 tumor suppressor activity. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor and tumor suppressor that can regulate gene expression in a manner requiring either its sequence specific DNA binding activity or its ability to bind the p300 coactivator. We show that IRF-1-mediated growth inhibition is dependent on the integrity of a C-terminal transcriptional enhancer domain. An enhancer subdomain (amino acids 301-325) that differentially regulates IRF-1 activity has been identified and this region mediates the repression of Cdk2. The repressor domain encompasses an LXXLL coregulator signature motif and mutations or deletions within this region completely uncouple transcriptional activation from repression. The loss of growth suppressor activity when the Cdk2-repressor domain of IRF-1 is mutated implicates repression as a determinant of its maximal growth inhibitory potential. The data link IRF-1 regulatory domains to its growth inhibitory activity and provide information about how differential gene regulation may contribute to IRF-1 tumor suppressor activity. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), 4The abbreviations used are: IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor-1; IFN, interferon; aa, amino acids; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; wt, wild-type. the founding member of the IRF family, is a transcription factor involved in many cellular processes including growth regulation, pathogen responses, immune activation, and inflammation (1Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 2Romeo G. Fiorucci G. Chiantore M.V. Percario Z.A. Vannucchi S. Affabris E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). IRF-1 activity is induced by a number of inhibitory cytokines, as well as by dsRNA, interferons (IFNs), and genotoxic stress (2Romeo G. Fiorucci G. Chiantore M.V. Percario Z.A. Vannucchi S. Affabris E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Pamment J. Ramsay E. Kelleher M. Dornan D. Ball K.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7776-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The best characterized activity of IRF-1 is as a sequence specific DNA-binding protein and transcriptional activator of genes involved in the IFN response. More recently IRF-1 has been shown to modulate the expression of p21, a gene involved in cell cycle control, in a manner that is independent of its DNA binding activity (4Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Lamphier M.S. Nozawa H. Matsuyama T. Mak T.W. Aizawa S. Tokino T. Oren M. Taniguchi T. Nature. 1996; 382: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IRF-1 synergizes with p53 stimulating p300 recruitment to, and subsequent acetylation of, promoterbound p53. This in turn produces a p53-dependent increase in p21 promoter activity (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition IRF-1 has been demonstrated to repress the expression of SLPI (secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor) and Cdk2 (6Xie R.L. Gupta S. Miele A. Shiffman D. Stein J.L.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, IRF-1 is both a transcriptional activator and repressor of gene expression. IRF-1 has been described as a tumor suppressor as its loss can increase susceptibility to transformation by oncogenes (8Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1994; 77: 829-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and expression of IRF-1 can revert the phenotype of cells transformed with c-Ha-ras or c-myc (9Kroger A. Dallugge A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1045-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the IRF-1 gene has been linked to the development of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (10Willman C.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Meeker T.C. List A.F. Science. 1993; 259: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and solid phase tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (11Tamura G. Ogasawara S. Nishizuka S. Sakata K. Maesawa C. Suzuki Y. Terashima M. Saito K. Satodate R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 612-615PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ogasawara S. Tamura G. Maesawa C. Suzuki Y. Ishida K. Satoh N. Uesugi N. Saito K. Satodate R. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In mice loss of IRF-1 function does not lead to a significant increase in spontaneous tumor formation; however, the absence of IRF-1 has a marked effect on previous tumor predisposition initiated by c-Ha-ras or by the loss of p53. Thus, the number of tumors and the tumor spectrum in IRF-1/p53-double null mice is dramatically different from that of p53-null animals (13Nozawa H. Oda E. Nakao K. Ishihara M. Ueda S. Yokochi T. Ogasawara K. Nakatsuru Y. Shimizu S. Ohira Y. Hioki K. Aizawa S. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Muto T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These results suggest that in mice IRF-1 displays the activity of a tumor susceptibility gene. The mechanism(s) used by IRF-1 to suppress tumor development are poorly understood, but its growth inhibitory activity does not rely on an autocrine feedback loop (14Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased tumorigenesis associated with the loss of IRF-1 is independent of immunological disorders (13Nozawa H. Oda E. Nakao K. Ishihara M. Ueda S. Yokochi T. Ogasawara K. Nakatsuru Y. Shimizu S. Ohira Y. Hioki K. Aizawa S. Ishikawa T. Katsuki M. Muto T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1240-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rather, IRF-1 tumor and growth suppressor activity seems to be intimately linked to intracellular signaling pathways that modulate the expression of specific genes (14Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Hauser H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Known IRF-1 target genes, which are involved in growth control, include, in addition to p21, 2-5A synthetase (15Coccia E.M. Del Russo N. Stellacci E. Orsatti R. Benedetti E. Marziali G. Hiscott J. Battistini A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR (16Kirchhoff S. Koromilas A.E. Schaper F. Grashoff M. Sonenberg N. Hauser H. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 439-445PubMed Google Scholar). IRF family members share a highly conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (aa 1-120), which is characterized by five tryptophan repeats (17Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 18Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Within the DNA binding domain there is also a region required for homodimerization (aa 90-115 (19Kirchhoff S. Schaper F. Oumard A. Hauser H. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) and a putative nuclear localization sequence (aa 116-139 (20Schaper F. Kirchhoff S. Posern G. Koster M. Oumard A. Sharf R. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)). The transactivation domain resides within the C-terminal half of the protein (aa 185-256) and is predicted to form a helix-loop-helix structure that is critical for IRF-1 activity (20Schaper F. Kirchhoff S. Posern G. Koster M. Oumard A. Sharf R. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Kim E.J. Park C.H. Park J.S. Um S.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17542-17549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adjacent to the activator domain is a region involved in enhancing transcription capacity (23Kirchhoff S. Oumard A. Nourbakhsh M. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The C terminus of IRF-1 is also involved in interactions with the CBP/p300 coactivator (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how the domain structure of IRF-1 is utilized to differentially regulate gene activation versus gene repression. Furthermore, the relationship between IRF-1 structure and its function(s) in growth inhibition and tumor suppression remains to be fully elucidated. Based on the observation that enhancer domain mutants of IRF-1 are severely compromised in their ability to suppress cell growth we have identified novel regulatory motifs within the C-terminal 25 amino acids of the protein which are involved in the differential modulation of gene activation and repression. We have used this information to generate mutant IRF-1 constructs in which transcriptional activation is completely uncoupled from Cdk2 gene repression. This has allowed us to demonstrate that inhibiting the expression of key downstream target genes contributes significantly to IRF-1 activity as a growth inhibitor. Thus, proteins that bind to, or modify, the extreme C terminus of IRF-1 are likely to modulate its activity. The data presented here shed light on how IRF-1 structure and function relate to its growth inhibitory activity and begins to define domains which may be important for IRF-1 mediated tumor suppression. Chemicals and Antibodies—Cdk2 was detected using mAb D-12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mAb IRF-1 was from BD Biosciences; both antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml. Cycloheximide (Supelco) was dissolved in H2O to 5 mg/ml and used at a concentration of 30 μg/ml in cell culture medium. IRF-1 Mutants—Oligonucleotides were designed containing the stop codon insertions and alanine substitutions as required (Sigma-Genosys). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used, and the manufacturer's instructions were followed. pcDNA3.1/IRF-1 was used as the plasmid template. Additional steps included a PCR purification (Qiagen) after DpnI digestion of the PCR product. Mini-plasmid preparations (Qiagen) were performed of selected transformed colonies, which were then confirmed by sequencing. Generation of the IRF-1YLP/A mutant in which Tyr109, Leu112, and Pro113 were mutated to Ala has been described previously (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HCT116/HCT116 (p53−/−) cells, H1299 cells, and SAOS2 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A, RPMI 1640, or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes the day before transfection. For colony formation assays cells were transfected with 1 μg of the corresponding plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's handbook. For luciferase reporter assays cells were transfected with 1 μg of p125(IFNβ)-Luc or -683Cdk2-Luc (from Dr. van Wijnen, University of Massachusetts) and 500 ng of the corresponding plasmid DNA. Colony Formation Assays—Cells were incubated for 48 h following transfection and then taken up into media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptavidin (Invitrogen), and 3% (v/v) Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes (Nunc) and incubated for 10 days. The medium was changed 4 days after seeding. Dishes were prepared by washing with PBS followed by fixation of cells with 100% methanol (−20 °C) for 0.5 h at room temperature. Methanol was discarded and cells were stained with 10% Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature. Dishes were thoroughly washed with water and left to dry. For each assay duplicate samples were prepared for every condition and several independent experiments performed on different batches of cells. For the data given the relative standard deviation was within 10%. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and the luciferase assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's handbook (Promega). Signals were quantified using a Fluroskan Ascent F1 luminometer (Labsystems). The results are given following standardization using an internal control and are for the mean ± S.D. Immunoblots—Cells were lysed in 5× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) or 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mix: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml soya bean trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml Pefabloc, 0.12 mm Benzamidine, 0.1 mm EDTA) incubated on ice for 10 and 20 min, respectively. Following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 2 min the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked in 5% milk-PBS + 0.1% Tween (5MPBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody diluted in 5MPBST for 1 h at room temperature followed by the secondary antibody diluted in 5MPBST for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoblots were washed extensively between each step with PBST and antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were transfected with IRF-1 and harvested 24 h later, RNA was extracted using a RNeasy mini kit with Qiashredders (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out using HotStarTaq (Qiagen) for 20 cycles for actin, 25 cycles for ISG20, and 45 cycles for TRAIL, using an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The primer sequences were as follows: TRAIL, ATGGCTATGATGGAGGTCCAG/TTGTCCTGCATCTGCTTCAGC; ISG20, CTACACAATCTACGACACGTCCACT/GATTCTCTGGGAGATTTGATAGAGC. EMSA—IRF-1-DNA binding assays were carried out as described previously (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using wt and mutant IRF-1 protein (3 μl/assay) expressed using a coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) together with an IRF-1-specific oligonucleotide probe (IRFE) labeled with biotin and an EMSA gel-shift kit (Panomics). IRF-1 Suppresses Cell Growth in Both the Presence and Absence of Functional p53—It has been suggested that the stimulation of IRF-1 activity can lead to inhibition of cell growth by impeding cell cycle progression or by engaging a cell death pathway (4Tanaka N.

In the current study we used colony formation assays to determine the activity of IRF-1 as a growth suppressor. The ability of IRF-1 to inhibit cell growth was assessed in two cell lines with differing p53 status; HCT116 colorectal cancer cells have a well characterized functional p53 pathway (28Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5187-5190PubMed Google Scholar), whereas H1299 cells are null for p53 (29Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Assays were set up and the conditions adjusted so that the number and density of colonies was optimal when the cells were transfected with an empty vector control (pcDNA3.1; Fig. 1a). When either HCT116 or H1299 cells were transfected with a vector containing wild-type human IRF-1 (pcDNA/IRF-1) the number of colonies was significantly reduced (p < 0.001 in both cases) giving a growth suppression of 76 + 4.2% (n = 3) and 87.3 + 2.2% (n = 3), respectively, when compared with the vector only controls (Fig. 1, a and b). Thus, IRF-1 suppresses growth in both the absence and presence of p53. We recently showed that IRF-1 could potentiate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest through induction of the growth suppressor protein p21 in a manner that required IRF-1 to interact with p300 to stimulate p53 acetylation (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The fact that IRF-1 can inhibit cell growth in the absence of p53 (Fig. 1, a and b) suggests that it is able to suppress growth by two distinct mechanisms dependent on the cellular status of p53. We therefore sought to establish whether IRF-1-dependent inhibition of colony growth in the absence of p53 required its activity as a transcription factor. Inhibition of Cell Growth by IRF-1 in the Absence of p53 Requires Sequence-specific DNA Binding and the Transcriptional Enhancer Domain—Mutant IRF-1 constructs that are defective in DNA binding (IRF-1YLP/A; has a decreased affinity for the IRFE in an EMSA (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) or in which the transcriptional enhancer domain has been deleted (IRF-1 Δenh; a truncation mutant in which the C-terminal 70 amino acids, 256-325, were deleted) are defective in their ability to activate expression from the IFNβ-promoter (Fig. 2a) (5Dornan D. Eckert M. Wallace M. Shimizu H. Ramsay E. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10083-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Kirchhoff S. Oumard A. Nourbakhsh M. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whereas the IRF-1YLP/A mutant is a very poor activator of the IFNβ reporter, IRF-1Δenh partially retains activity in this assay. In addition to acting as a transcriptional activator IRF-1 has also been reported to suppress the expression of some genes. When a reporter construct was used to determine expression from the Cdk2-promoter, wild-type IRF-1 was shown to be an efficient repressor, whereas both the IRF-1YLP/A and IRF-1Δenh mutants had lost the ability to repress expression from this promoter (Fig. 2b) despite the fact that they were expressed at higher levels than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2c). These experiments were carried out using H1299 cells and confirmed using HCT116 (p53−/−) cells (data not shown). To determine whether defects in the transactivation and repressor activity of the IRF-1YPL/A and IRF-1Δenh mutants affect their ability to suppress cell growth, they were assessed in colony formation assays. The IRF-1YLP/A mutant was substantially impaired as a growth suppressor relative to the wild-type protein (with only 16% of wild-type activity; Fig. 2, d and e). Similar to IRF-1YLP/A, the IRF-1Δenh mutant was severely compromised as a growth inhibitor. In colony formation assays IRF-1Δenh retained only 20% of the wild-type proteins inhibitory activity (Fig. 2, d and e). The data suggest that the enhancer domain and sequence specific DNA binding are important for IRF-1-mediated gene activation, gene repression, and growth inhibition. In addition, the data show a good correlation between the ability of IRF-1 to activate and repress transcription with its ability to inhibit H1299 cell growth. Thus, colony formation assays provide a system to investigate the link between IRF-1-dependent modulation of transcription and its activity as a growth inhibitor. Uncoupling IRF-1-dependent Transactivation from Cdk2 Repression Reveals a Role for Gene Repression in IRF-1-dependent Growth Inhibition—Although the enhancer domain has been defined as a region that has no intrinsic activation capacity but which can synergize with the activator domain of IRF-1 to give optimal transcription (23Kirchhoff S. Oumard A. Nourbakhsh M. Levi B.Z. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6753-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it has not been studied in the context of full-length IRF-1 nor in terms of IRF-1 growth suppressor function. As deletion of the enhancer domain affected both IRF-1-dependent transcriptional activation and repression, as well as IRF-1 mediated growth control (Fig. 2), we wished to further define its function in the control of cell growth. First we addressed whether the determinants required for gene activation were the same as those required for gene repression. When the C-terminal 25 amino acids of IRF-1 were deleted (aa 301-325; IRF-1ΔC25), there was no loss of transcriptional activity as measured using the IFNβ-reporter (Fig. 3a), in fact there was a 1.6-fold increase, which may be explained by an increase in protein expression level (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, there was a striking decrease in the ability of the IRF-1ΔC25 mutant to repress transcription from the Cdk2-promoter (Fig. 3b). To confirm the importance of the C terminus of IRF-1 in regulation of its transcriptional activity, we looked at the effect of the enhancer and C-terminal 25 amino acid regions on the expression of endogenous IRF-1 promoter targets. When mRNA expression for two validated IRF-1 targets, TRAIL (27Clarke N. Jimenez-Lara A.M. Voltz E. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and ISG20 (30Gongora C. Degols G. Espert L. Hua T.D. Mechti N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were examined the results supported those obtained using reporter assays (Fig. 3d). TRAIL mRNA levels were barely present in cells transfected with a vector only control whereas cells expressing exogenous IRF-1 had readily detectable TRAIL mRNA (Fig. 3d, upper panel: lane 1 versus lane 2). As predicted from the experiments described above (Fig. 2), the IRF-1YLP/A and the IRF-1Δenh mutants were unable to promote up-regulation of TRAIL mRNA (lanes 3 and 4), whereas in keeping with results from the IFNβ reporter assays IRF-1ΔC25 enhanced TRAIL mRNA levels to a greater degree than the wt protein (lane 5 versus lane 2). ISG20 mRNA levels showed a similar trend to those of TRAIL (Fig. 3d, upper panel), although the basal levels of ISG20 mRNA in the absence of exogenous IRF-1 were higher. To support the data showing IRF-1 as a repressor of Cdk2, we measured Cdk2 protein levels (Fig. 3e). Wild-type IRF-1 reduced Cdk2 protein levels by ∼60%, whereas the IRF-1YPL/A, IRF-1ΔC25, and IRF-1Δenh mutants had no significant effect on levels of Cdk2 protein. The IFNβ and Cdk2 reporter assays therefore reflect changes in the expression from endogenous IRF-1 target promoters. Thus, deletion of 25 amino acids from the C terminus of IRF-1 completely uncouples its Cdk2 repressor activity from transcriptional activation, suggesting that the enhancer domain contains distinct functional motifs that differentially regulate gene expression. As the IRF-1ΔC25 mutant has lost the ability to repress the Cdk2-promoter while retaining activity against the IFNβ-promoter, we were able to use this mutant to ask whether the selective loss of Cdk2 repressor function affected IRF-1-mediated growth inhibition. In fact the IRF-1ΔC25 mutant has a significant defect in its ability to inhibit cell growth when compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3, d and e). There was double the number of colonies on the plates with mutant IRF-1 (IRF-1Δ25) compared with plates with wild-type protein (Fig. 3e; p < 0.01). Thus, loss of IRF-1 activity as a repressor of Cdk2 expression correlates with a decrease in IRF-1-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The C Terminus of IRF-1 Contains a Negative Regulatory Domain for IFNβ Expression—The data presented in the previous section suggests that elements within the last 25 amino acids of IRF-1 are important for the control of IRF-1 activity in gene repression and growth inhibition. To investigate the C terminus further a series of C-terminal truncation mutants of IRF-1 were generated in which stop codons were introduced sequentially throughout the last 25 amino acids (Fig. 4a). To characterize the mutant proteins reporter assays were carried out in HCT116 (p53−/−) cells (all results were confirmed using H1299; data not shown). The results show similar activation of the IFNβ-promoter by wild-type IRF-1, IRF-1ΔC4, and IRF-1ΔC8 (Fig. 4b). An increase in transcriptional activity was then detected with the deletion of a further 4 amino acids (IRF-1ΔC12; Fig. 4b). The increase was sustained with the loss of additional residues up to aa 301 (IRF-1ΔC12 to IRF-1ΔC25; Fig. 4b). This is in contrast to removal of the C-terminal 70 residues (IRF-1Δenh), which reduces IRF-1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2a). All the truncation mutants were expressed at similar levels except for IRF-1ΔC4, which was present at lower levels. Further investigation revealed that differences in the levels of expressed protein were not due to variation in mRNA or in protein solubility (data not shown) but were the result of more rapid protein turnover. Thus, whereas the half-life of IRF-1 wild-type protein in cyclohexamide-treated cells was 30-45 min, the t0.5 for IRF-1ΔC4 was ∼15 min (data not shown). Truncation mutants IRF-1ΔC15, IRF-1ΔC20, and IRF-1ΔC25 all had elevated transcriptional activity against the IFNβ-promoter; this could be explained, at least in part, by an accompanying increase in protein levels, consistent with the idea that there is a degradation motif within the C terminus (31Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that the region between amino acids 311-317 of the protein has a negative effect on IRF-1-dependent activation of IFNβ expression that is revealed when these amino acids are deleted. To confirm the role of the C terminus in negative regulation of IRF-1-dependent transcription we generated a set of Ala mutants that showed less variability in expression levels (Fig. 3c). The results show that substitution of residues from 311-313 (IRF-1M4Ala) had the most striking effect (2.4-fold increase) on IRF-1-dependent transcription from the IFNβ-promoter (Fig. 4b), whereas IRF-1M1Ala had decreased activity, most likely due to the fact that, like IRF-1ΔC4, this mutant is present at low levels due to rapid degradation (data not shown). There was a reproducible increase in activity for IRF-1M2Ala, IRF-1M3Ala, and IRF-1M5Ala suggesting that residues surrounding 311-314 contribute to negative regulation, whereas IRF-1M6Ala (301-305) did not have a statistically significant effect on IRF-1 activity compared with the wild-type protein. Taken together the data from the truncation and alanine substitution mutants suggest that residues centered around 311-317 of IRF-1 are involved in either intra- or intermolecular interactions that negatively regulate IRF-1 transcriptional activity. An LXXLL Motif in the C Terminus of IRF-1 Is Linked to Gene Repression—Studies presented above (Fig. 3) suggested that residues from within the C-terminal 25 amino acids had a profound effect on the ability of IRF-1 to act as a repressor of Cdk2 gene expression and also impact on its growth inhibitory activity (Fig. 3). Using the set of mutant constructs described in the previous section (Fig. 4), we sought to pinpoint the residues that were key for gene repression. Using the Cdk2-reporter assay in HCT116 (p53−/−) cells, we foun"

In an ample number of hTg preparations, the fraction of hTg-CS in total hTg ranged from 32.0 to 71.6%. By exploiting the electrophoretic mobility shift and metachromasia conferred by chondroitin 6-sulfate upon the products of limited proteolysis of hTg, chondroitin 6-sulfate was first restricted to a carboxyl-terminal region, starting at residue 2514. A single chondroitin 6-sulfate-containing nonapeptide was isolated in pure form from the products of digestion of hTg with endoproteinase Glu-C, and its sequence was determined as LTAGXGLRE (residues 2726-2734, X being Ser2730 linked to the oligosaccharide chain). In an in vitro assay of enzymatic iodination, hTg-CS produced higher yields of 3,5,5 ′-triiodothyronine (T3) (171%) and 3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodothyronine (T4) (134%) than hTg-CS0. Unfractionated hTg behaved as hTg-CS. Thus, chondroitin 6-sulfate addition to a subset of hTg molecules enhanced the overall level of T4 and, in particular, T3 formation. Furthermore, the chondroitin 6-sulfate oligosaccharide unit of hTg-CS protected peptide bond Lys2714-Gly2715 from proteolysis, during the limited digestion of hTg-CS with trypsin. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of regulation of the hormonogenic efficiency and of the T4/T3 ratio in hTg.

It is also a major antigen, involved in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity. In fact, experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) can be induced in genetically susceptible mice by immunization with human thyroglobulin (hTg) in complete adjuvant, and autoantibodies to hTg are found in the blood of humans affected with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), even though their pathogenic significance is unclear (1Gentile F. Conte M. Formisano S. Immunology. 2004; 112: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Several post-translational modifications contribute to the molecular microheterogeneity of hTg, including iodination, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation (reviewed in Ref. 2Gentile F. Di Lauro R. Salvatore G. De-Groot L.J. Endocrinology. 3rd Ed. 1. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 517-542Google Scholar). Iodine addition and hormone formation at specific sites have the most obvious implications for thyroid function, but the effects of glycosylation on the hormone-forming efficiency at specific sites and on the antigenicity of Tg have also been documented (3Mallet B.

Chem. 1972; 247: 1825-1835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another O-linked type D oligosaccharide unit was described, which was composed of a repeating d-glucuronic acid-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine sulfate disaccharide attached to the polypeptide chain through a d-galactosyl-d-xylosyl-serine linkage region (8Spiro M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5424-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further study indicated that the repeating disaccharides were of the chondroitin 6-sulfate type (9Schneider A.B. McCurdy A. Chang T. Dudlak D. Magner J. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2428-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Spiro R.G. Bhoyroo V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14351-14358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number and localization of type D oligosaccharide units in hTg were not determined. A number of studies have documented the influence of oligosaccharide chains in the processing and/or presentation of glycoproteic antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (11Anderton S.M. Curr.

Prompted by these observations, we began to determine in detail the number and localization of chondroitin 6-sulfate oligosaccharide unit(s) in hTg as a basis for further studies on their influence on the immunopathogenicity of hTg in a murine model of EAT. We found that the addition of chondroitin 6-sulfate unit(s) is a major source of molecular microheterogeneity of hTg. In dozens of hTg preparations examined, it was regularly found in a percentage of hTg molecules varying from 32.0 to 71.6% of total. Moreover, we determined that a single chondroitin 6-sulfate unit per hTg polypeptide chain is linked to Ser2730. We also observed changes in the hormone-forming efficiency of hTg and in the proteolytic accessibility of the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of hTg, associated with the presence of the chondroitin 6-sulfate oligosaccharide chain. The former observation contributes to delineate a general mechanism, by which modifications in the composition and number of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharide units determine changes in the hormone-forming efficiency of the main hormonogenic domains at both hTg extremities, whereas the latter finding supports the potential role of the chondroitin 6-sulfate oligosaccharide unit in modifying the susceptibility of hTg to processing by APCs and the repertoire of hTg epitopes thus generated. Materials—Thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus rokko (EC 3.4.24.4), l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyltreated trypsin from bovine pancreas (EC 3.4.21.4), endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus (EC 3.4.21.19), lactoperoxidase (LPO) from bovine milk (EC 1.11.1.7), and glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (EC 1.1.3.4) were purchased from Sigma.

Solid-phase radioimmunoassay kits for total 3,5,5′-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3′,5′-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T4) were from Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). Marker kit MW-SDS-17S and other analytical grade chemicals were from Sigma. Purification of hTg—hTg was prepared as described (21Gentile F. Salvatore G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 603-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) from informed euthyroid patients hemilaryngectomized for non-thyroidal disease and patients undergoing thyroidectomy for nonfamilial, simple, or multinodular goiter. Protein concentration was assayed by measuring the optical absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 10 cm−1 for a 1% solution. Iodine content was assayed as described, using l-thyroxine as the standard (22Palumbo G. Tecce M.F. Ambrosio G. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Ion-exchange Chromatography of hTg on HiTrap™ Q-Sepharose HP (Q-IEC)—hTg molecules containing type D (chondroitin 6-sulfate) oligosaccharide units (hTg-CS) were separated from residual hTg molecules, devoid of type D units (hTg-CS0), by ion-exchange chromatography on trimethylamino-substituted Q-Sepharose (Q-IEC) using 5-ml HiTrap™ Q-Sepharose HP columns, equilibrated in 0.025 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Up to 20 mg of hTg in buffer A, plus 0.05 m NaCl, were applied to a column. After washing with buffer A, a linear gradient from 0 to 100% of buffer B (1.2 m NaCl in buffer A) was developed in 24 min at the flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. One-ml fractions were analyzed or stored at −80 °C until use. Compositional Analysis of Q-IEC Fractions of hTg—d-Glucuronic acid was assayed in Q-IEC fractions by the meta-hydroxybiphenyl method (23Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar), using the same compound (0-5 μg) as the standard. Duplicate samples of 30-500 μg of hTg were dialyzed against 0.01 m NH4HCO3, dried in centrifugal evaporator, and redissolved in 0.2 ml of double-distilled H2O in borosilicate Pyrex tubes. Samples were processed by the addition of 1.2 ml of 0.0125 m Na2B4O7·10H2OinH2SO4 and, after heating in boiling water bath for 5 min and cooling on ice, 0.02 ml of 0.15% meta-hydroxybiphenyl in 0.5% NaOH, after which the optical absorbance at 520 nm was read. Correction for aspecific color development was provided by a replicate set of samples, which were treated identically, with the exclusion of meta-hydroxybiphenyl in the 0.5% NaOH reagent. Total neutral hexoses were assayed in duplicate samples of 20-300 μg of hTg by the anthrone method (24Spiro R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 3-25Crossref Scopus (953) Google Scholar), using d-galactose (0-20 μg) as the standard. Sialic acid was assayed in duplicate samples of 40-500 μg of hTg by the thiobarbituric acid method (25Warren L. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 463-464Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), using N-acetylneuraminic acid (0-15 μg) as the standard. Iodine was assayed in duplicate samples of 30-200 μg of hTg, using the method cited (22Palumbo G. Tecce M.F. Ambrosio G. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzymatic in Vitro Iodination of hTg and Analysis of the Iodine, T3, and T4 Content—hTg from goiters, with an iodine content not exceeding 0.09% on a weight basis, was iodinated enzymatically in vitro. Bulk iodination of 20 mg of unfractionated hTg, at the concentration of 0.45 g/liter, was performed in 0.02 m imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0, using 2 μg/ml of LPO from bovine milk, 4 × 10−5 m potassium iodide, 1 × 10−3 m d-glucose, and 0.19 μg/ml glucose oxidase from A. niger. Iodination was stopped with 0.05 m 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI). Comparative iodination of unfractionated hTg and of hTg-CS0 and hTg-CS subfractions of the same hTg preparation was performed with 0.65 mg of each protein, under identical conditions, except that 7.5 × 10−5 m potassium iodide, and 0.21μg/ml glucose oxidase were used. Aliquots of 0.1 mg of hTg were withdrawn at 5, 15, 30, 50, 70, and 90 min, supplemented with MMI, dialyzed against 0.01 m NH4HCO3, 5 × 10−3m NaCl, and assayed in duplicate for protein content, using the BCA protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard, and for iodine content, as already described. For the assay of T3 and T4, 10-15 μg of hTg were hydrolyzed at 37 °C with Pronase, at the enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:1, in 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 0.05 m MMI, pH 8.0, to which 15 μl of toluene were added. After 24 h, aminopeptidase M was added, at the enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:10, and digestion was prolonged for 24 h at 37 °C, after which T3 and T4 were measured by solid-phase radioimmunoassays in antibody-coated tubes (26Hollander C.S. Shenkman L. Rothfeld B. Nuclear Medicine in Vitro. Lippincott, Philadelphia1974: 136-149Google Scholar). In both assays, 125I-labeled T3 or T4 competed with the respective hormone in the test samples for antibody sites. After the tubes were decanted and radioactivity was measured, the T3 or T4 concentration was obtained by interpolation from a calibration curve. Limited Proteolysis of hTg—hTg, at the concentration of 1 g/liter in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, was digested with thermolysin, at the enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:50, at 30 °C for 80 min, or with l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl-treated trypsin (henceforth referred to as trypsin), at the enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:100, at 30 °C for 20 or 40 min. Proteolytic digestion was stopped with 3 × 10−5 m antipain, 2 × 10−6 m aprotinin, 5 × 10−4 m benzamidine, 4 × 10−5m leupeptin, 1 × 10−4 m Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 2 × 10−5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 × 10−3 m EDTA and, in the case of trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, at the inhibitor/enzyme weight ratio of 3:1. Thereafter, concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to a final concentration of 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 1.36 m glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, and the samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 1.5 min and immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic Digestion of Chondroitin 6-Sulfate Oligosaccharide Units of hTg, hTg Subfractions, and hTg Proteolytic Fragments with Chondroitinase ABC—hTg, or its proteolytic fragments in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, were supplemented with equal volumes of 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Pooled fractions from the Q2 peak of the Q-IEC of hTg were dialyzed against the same buffer. All samples were supplemented with 200 milliunits/ml of chondroitinase ABC from P. vulgaris, which degrades chondroitin 4-sulfate and 6-sulfate oligosaccharide chains into sulfated disaccharides by hydrolyzing the β-(1→4)-glycosidic bonds between N-acetyl-d-galactosamine 4- and 6-sulfate and d-glucuronic acid in the repeating disaccharide units. The protease inhibitors already indicated with regard to limited proteolysis were added, when not already present, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Samples to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE were immediately precipitated in methanol/chloroform/water (27Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), although those to be used for enzymatic iodination in vitro or limited tryptic digestion, following chondroitinase ABC digestion, were subjected to Q rechromatography, as already described, concentrated in Centriprep 30 concentrators, and dialyzed against the appropriate buffer. Separation and Identification of the Products of Limited Proteolysis of hTg—Analytical PAGE of the digestion products of hTg in Tris/glycine/SDS was performed using 4-17% total acrylamide, 2.7% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide gradient gels. Molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were as follows: myosin (205,000 Da), β-galactosidase (116,000 Da), phosphorylase b (94,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (68,000 Da), ovalbumin (45,000 Da), carbonic anhydrase (30,000 Da), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,000 Da). Two replicas of each gel were prepared. One was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 25% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid and destained in 25% (v/v) methanol, 10% acetic acid. The other one was fixed in 25% 2-propanol, 10% acetic acid, thoroughly rinsed in double-distilled H2O, stained with 0.005% DMTCC in 50% formamide for 48 h, and finally destained in 5% (v/v) glycerol in tap water (28Dahlberg A.E. Dingman C.W. Peacock A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Bands were identified on the basis of their mobilities, according to the detailed characterization of their NH2-terminal peptide sequences provided in a previous study (21Gentile F. Salvatore G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 603-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments to be identified ex novo were separated by reducing or nonreducing SDS-PAGE in 4-17% acrylamide gradient gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore) by semi-dry blotting in 0.025 m Tris, 0.01 m glycine, at the constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1 h. Membranes were rinsed in double-distilled H2O, stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol, and destained in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. Bands were subjected to NH2-terminal peptide sequencing at the Molecular Structure Facility, University of California, Davis. Peptide sequences were aligned with the cDNA-derived sequence of hTg (29van de Graaf S.A.R. Ris-Stalpers C. Pauws E. Mendive F.M. Targovnik H.M. de Vijlder J.J.M. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 170: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Isolation and Sequencing of Glycopeptide hTg-CSgp—Forty seven mg of hTg-CS were denatured and reduced in 15 ml of 0.3 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 6.0 m guanidine/HCl, 1 × 10−3 m EDTA, 0.01 m dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 2 h. The reduced protein was carboxymethylated with a 5-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide, with respect to total -SH groups, at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Alkylation was stopped with excess dithiothreitol. The sample was dialyzed against 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, and digested with endoproteinase Glu-C (protease V8) from S. aureus at the enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:100 at 37 °C for 18 h. The sample was adjusted with concentrated solutions to 0.025 m Tris/HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 2.0 m urea, pH 7.4 (buffer C), and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap™ Q-Sepharose HP column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with buffer C, a gradient was started from 0 to 100% of buffer D (1.2 m NaCl in buffer C) in 55 min, followed by 100% buffer D for 10 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were monitored for the optical absorbance at 280 nm and d-glucuronic acid content. A single d-glucuronic acid-containing peak was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a 1.5 × 100-cm column of Bio-Gel P-2 in 0.01 m NH4HCO3.A d-glucuronic acid-containing peak, eluted in the void volume, was lyophilized and further purified by gel chromatography on a 0.5 × 40-cm column of Sephadex G-50 fine in 0.01 m NH4HCO3. One-ml fractions were monitored for peptide content, by measuring the optical absorbance at 220 nm, and d-glucuronic acid content, and a single peptide- and d-glucuronic acid-containing peak was lyophilized. A solubilized aliquot was subjected to NH2-terminal peptide microsequencing. Purity was checked by PAGE in Tris/Tricine/SDS in a 16.5% total acrylamide, 6% N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide gel, containing 6.0 m urea (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards (marker kit MW-SDS-17S, Sigma) were as follows: myoglobin fragments 1-153 (16,950 Da), 1-131 (14,440 Da), 56-153 (10,600 Da), 56-131 (8,160 Da), 1-55 (6,210 Da), glucagon (3,480 Da), and myoglobin fragment 132-153 (2,510 Da). SDS-PAGE was followed by semi-dry transfer to Immobilon P, as described above, for 25 min. The membrane was stained with DMTCC in 50% formamide and destained in tap water (28Dahlberg A.E. Dingman C.W. Peacock A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Purification of Carboxyl-terminal Tryptic Fragments of hTg by HPLC—The fragments obtained from the limited digestion of 20 mg of goiter hTg (0.03% of iodine on a weight basis) with trypsin for 20 min, under the conditions described above, were freed from trypsin immediately after digestion by filtration through a 10-ml column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow in 0.025 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.2. hTg fragments were eluted with 0.15 m NaCl in 0.025 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and desalted by gel filtration on a 1.5 × 100-cm column of Bio-Gel P-2, equilibrated with 0.01 m NH4HCO3. One-mg aliquots of the fragments were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC with a Vydac C-4 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm) equilibrated in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (solvent A) and containing 2% of 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). After 2 min at 35% of solvent B, the fragments were eluted with a two-step linear gradient from 35 to 46% of solvent B over 35 min and from 46 to 55.5% over the following 35 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 4-17% total acrylamide gradient gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Corresponding peaks from repeated runs were pooled for further mass spectrometric analysis. Characterization of Carboxyl-terminal Tryptic Fragments of hTg by Electrospray Mass Spectrometry—ES-MS of peptide h4bisTR were recorded on a Q-TOF Ultima hybrid mass spectrometer (Waters), equipped with an electrospray ion source and operating in positive ion mode. A nanoflow high pressure pump system model CapLC (Waters) was used to deliver a 1-μl/min flow rate of 10% acetonitrile to the mass spectrometer. The spectra were scanned at the speed of 10 s/scan. The source conditions were the following: capillary voltage, 3000 V; cone voltage, 100 V; extractor, 0 V; RF lens, 60. Raw data were processed using the MassLynx 3.5 software. Mass calibration was carried out using the multiple charged ions from a separate introduction of horse heart myoglobin (average molecular mass of 16,950.5 Da). The quantitative analysis was performed by integration of the multiple charged ions of the single species. Molecular masses are reported as average values. The mass signals recorded were associated with the corresponding peptides, on the basis of the expected molecular masses, using the Biolynx software (Waters). A Relevant Fraction of hTg Is Regularly Composed of hTg Molecules Provided with Type D (Chondroitin 6-Sulfate) Oligosaccharide Units—Type D (chondroitin 6-sulfate) oligosaccharide unit-containing hTg molecules were separated from residual hTg molecules by using ion-exchange chromatography on trimethylamino-substituted HiTrap™ Q-Sepharose HP (GE Healthcare). The Q-IEC of 40 hTg preparations, mostly from nonfamilial, simple, and multinodular goiters but also from normal thyroids, using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.2 mol/liter in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, regularly resulted in the elution of two peaks (henceforth referred to as peaks Q1 and Q2, in elution order) at NaCl concentrations of 0.45 ± 0.01 and 0.84 ± 0.03 m, respectively (Fig. 1). In 18 chromatograms, the area under the Q2 peak varied from 32 to 71.6% of total (mean, 52.8%; median, 51.7%), with no apparent relation with the iodine content (Table 1). The hTg subpopulations thus separated were stable, and separation was satisfactory for practical purposes, as shown by pooling and rechromatography of the two peaks (Fig. 2, panel A). We traced chondroitin 6-sulfate oligosaccharide units in hTg fractions by assaying their d-glucuronic acid content, using a meta-hydroxybiphenyl-based method (23Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). d-Glucuronic acid was almost exclusively restricted in the Q2 peak, which coincided with a fraction of hTg, marked by the presence of d-glucuronic acid-containing type D (chondroitin 6-sulfate) oligosaccharide units (henceforth referred to as hTg-CS) (Fig. 1). Negligible amounts of d-glucuronic acid in the Q1 peak possibly reflected the presence of hTg molecules with very short, nascent type D oligosaccharide chains. The neutral hexose content remained constant or increased slightly along the elution profile of the chromatograms, while the sialic acid content showed no change or only moderate changes in either sense (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Instead, the number of moles of d-glucuronic acid per mol of hTg regularly exhibited a linear increase across the Q2 peak, ranging from a minimum of about 3 to a maximum of 13.2 mol in the hTg preparation with the lowest fraction of hTg-CS, and of 24.0 mol in some hTg-CS-rich goiter hTg preparations (Table 1). In particular, preparations Mi. and Mi. N. had elution profiles (preparations are named using last initial(s) of patients), in which a shoulder in the trailing edge of the Q2 peak indicated the presence of a secondary component, eluting at 0.96 m NaCl (Fig. 2, panel B). We hypothesized that the complexity and extended span of d-glucuronic acid content of these Q2 peaks might reflect the coexistence of heterodimeric hTg-CS, with a single chondroitin 6-sulfate-bearing subunit, and homodimeric hTg-CS. To prove this, pooled fractions of the Q2 peak from the Q-IEC of hTg Mi. N. were dissociated in 0.04 m Tris/HCl, 2.5 m urea, pH 9.0, at 20 °C overnight, as described previously (31Gentile F. Veneziani B.M. Sellitto C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and subjected again to Q-IEC, using a NaCl gradient from 0 to 1.2 mol/liter in 2.5 m urea, 0.055 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. As shown in Fig. 2, panel B, the hTg monomers produced by the dissociation of hTg-CS in urea were separated again into peaks Q1 and Q2, eluting at NaCl concentrations of 0.44 and 0.86 mol/liter, respectively.
