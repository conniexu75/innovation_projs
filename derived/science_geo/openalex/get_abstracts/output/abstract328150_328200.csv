https://openalex.org/W1991315594,Anaerobic soils released more phosphate to soil solutions low in soluble phosphate and sorbed more phosphate from soil solutions high in soluble phosphate than did aerobic soils. The difference in behavior of phosphate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is attributed to the change brought about in ferric oxyhydroxide by soil reduction. The probably greater surface area of the gel-like reduced ferrous compounds in an anaerobic soil results in more soil phosphate being solubilized where solution phosphate is low and more solution phosphate being sorbed where solution phosphate is high.
https://openalex.org/W1990051320,"While the question of whether the Arthropoda represent more than one phylum of animals is debatable, the jointed exoskeleton, a fundamental feature of arthropods, evolved independently in two groups that shared a worm-like common ancestor. The two major branches of Arthropoda, the primitively marine TCC and the primitively terrestrial (with one exception) Uniramia, independently arrived at arthropodization as the solution to the same problems of adaptation of the body mechanical system. New discoveries on trilobite anatomy show the unity of TCC as a group that shared a trilobite-like ancestor near the beginning of the Cambrian. With change in the constituency of Arthropoda through geologic time, the ways in which it would be categorized as a taxonomic group have also changed. The seeming isolation of the major modern arthropod groups is in large part an artifact of extinction of primitive intermediate forms such as trilobites which, in the Early Paleozoic, made the Arthropoda more diverse in basic modes of body organization than the group is at present."

The included angle between the average field direction when the field polarity was away from the sun and the average direction when the field polarity was toward the sun was 168 degrees , rather than 180 degrees as predicted by Parker. This effect appears to have a sunspot cycle variation."

It consists of an introductory statement by Lord Curzon, as Lord President of the 1 Privy Council, the report of the Advisory Council, signed by Sir William McCormick and Sir Frank Heath, and appendices giving Orders in Council, terms of the Imperial Trust, documents relating to research associations, and names of members of committees attached to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Lord Curzon points out in his introduction that the foundation of the department led to the creation of the Imperial Trust for the encouragement of scientific and industrial research."
https://openalex.org/W1988642210,"Long-term temperature records at Phoenix, Arizona, indicate the existence of a post-1946 warming trend that may be attributed to the buildup of pollution in the lower layers of the atmosphere. The causative mechanism appears to be an enhancement of the so-called ""greenhouse effect,"" induced by the inter-action of aerosol with long-wavelength thermal radiation in the lower atmosphere."
