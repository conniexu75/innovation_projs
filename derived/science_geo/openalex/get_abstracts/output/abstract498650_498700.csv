Previous research on TSPO was based entirely on in vitro experiments, and its critical role was reinforced by an early report that claimed TSPO knock-out mice were embryonic lethal. In a previous publication, we examined Leydig cell-specific TSPO conditional knock-out mice that suggested TSPO was not required for testosterone production in vivo. This raised controversy and several questions regarding TSPO function. To examine the definitive role of TSPO in steroidogenesis and embryo development, we generated global TSPO null (Tspo−/−) mice. Contrary to the early report, Tspo−/− mice survived with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities and were fertile. Examination of adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis showed no defects in Tspo−/− mice. Adrenal transcriptome comparison of gene expression profiles showed that genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis (Star, Cyp11a1, and Hsd3b1) were unchanged in Tspo−/− mice. Adrenocortical ultrastructure illustrated no morphological alterations in Tspo−/− mice. In an attempt to correlate our in vivo findings to previously used in vitro models, we also determined that siRNA knockdown or the absence of TSPO in different mouse and human steroidogenic cell lines had no effect on steroidogenesis. These findings directly refute the dogma that TSPO is indispensable for steroid hormone biosynthesis and viability. By amending the current model, this study advances our understanding of steroidogenesis with broad implications in biology and medicine.

https://openalex.org/W2060308865,"Biotic indices, which reflect the quality of the environment, are widely used in the marine realm. Sometimes, key species or ecosystem engineers are selected for this purpose. This is the case of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, widely used as a biological quality element in the context of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The good quality of a water body and the apparent health of a species, whether or not an ecosystem engineer such as P. oceanica, is not always indicative of the good structure and functioning of the whole ecosystem. A key point of the recent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is the ecosystem-based approach. Here, on the basis of a simplified conceptual model of the P. oceanica ecosystem, we have proposed an ecosystem-based index of the quality of its functioning, compliant with the MSFD requirements. This index (EBQI) is based upon a set of representative functional compartments, the weighting of these compartments and the assessment of the quality of each compartment by comparison of a supposed baseline. The index well discriminated 17 sites in the north-western Mediterranean (French Riviera, Provence, Corsica, Catalonia and Balearic Islands) covering a wide range of human pressure levels. The strong points of the EBQI are that it is easy to implement, non-destructive, relatively robust, according to the selection of the compartments and to their weighting, and associated with confidence indices that indicate possible weakness and biases and therefore the need for further field data acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2105528072,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting the protein translation or targeting the mRNA cleavage. They play many important roles in living organism cells; however, the knowledge on miRNAs functions has become more extensive upon their identification in biological fluids and recent reports on plant-origin miRNAs abundance in human plasma and serum. Considering these findings, we performed a rigorous bioinformatics analysis of publicly available, raw data from high-throughput sequencing studies on miRNAs composition in human and porcine breast milk exosomes to identify the fraction of food-derived miRNAs. Several processing and filtering steps were applied to increase the accuracy, and to avoid false positives. Through aforementioned analysis, 35 and 17 miRNA species, belonging to 25 and 11 MIR families, were identified, respectively. In the human samples the highest abundance levels yielded the ath-miR166a, pab-miR951, ptc-miR472a and bdi-miR168, while in the porcine breast milk exosomes, the zma-miR168a, zma-miR156a and ath-miR166a have been identified in the largest amounts. The consensus prediction and annotation of potential human targets for select plant miRNAs suggest that the aforementioned molecules may interact with mRNAs coding several transcription factors, protein receptors, transporters and immune-related proteins, thus potentially influencing human organism. Taken together, the presented analysis shows proof of abundant plant miRNAs in mammal breast milk exosomes, pointing at the same time to the new possibilities arising from this discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2029567285,"The filovirus Ebola (EBOV) causes the most severe hemorrhagic fever known. The EBOV RNA-dependent polymerase complex includes a filovirus-specific VP30, which is critical for the transcriptional but not replication activity of EBOV polymerase; to support transcription, VP30 must be in a dephosphorylated form. Here we show that EBOV VP30 is phosphorylated not only at the N-terminal serine clusters identified previously but also at the threonine residues at positions 143 and 146. We also show that host cell protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) controls VP30 dephosphorylation because expression of a PP1-binding peptide cdNIPP1 increased VP30 phosphorylation. Moreover, targeting PP1 mRNA by shRNA resulted in the overexpression of SIPP1, a cytoplasm-shuttling regulatory subunit of PP1, and increased EBOV transcription, suggesting that cytoplasmic accumulation of PP1 induces EBOV transcription. Furthermore, we developed a small molecule compound, 1E7-03, that targeted a non-catalytic site of PP1 and increased VP30 dephosphorylation. The compound inhibited the transcription but increased replication of the viral genome and completely suppressed replication of EBOV in cultured cells. Finally, mutations of Thr(143) and Thr(146) of VP30 significantly inhibited EBOV transcription and strongly induced VP30 phosphorylation in the N-terminal Ser residues 29-46, suggesting a novel mechanism of regulation of VP30 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that targeting PP1 with small molecules is a feasible approach to achieve dysregulation of the EBOV polymerase activity. This novel approach may be used for the development of antivirals against EBOV and other filovirus species."
https://openalex.org/W2053421276,"VMSbase is an R package devised to manage, process and visualize information about fishing vessels activity (provided by the vessel monitoring system--VMS) and catches/landings (as reported in the logbooks). VMSbase is primarily conceived to be user-friendly; to this end, a suite of state-of-the-art analyses is accessible via a graphical interface. In addition, the package uses a database platform allowing large datasets to be stored, managed and processed vey efficiently. Methodologies include data cleaning, that is removal of redundant or evidently erroneous records, and data enhancing, that is interpolation and merging with external data sources. In particular, VMSbase is able to estimate sea bottom depth for single VMS pings using an on-line connection to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. It also allows VMS pings to be assigned to whatever geographic partitioning has been selected by users. Standard analyses comprise: 1) métier identification (using a modified CLARA clustering approach on Logbook data or Artificial Neural Networks on VMS data); 2) linkage between VMS and Logbook records, with the former organized into fishing trips; 3) discrimination between steaming and fishing points; 4) computation of spatial effort with respect to user-selected grids; 5) calculation of standard fishing effort indicators within Data Collection Framework; 6) a variety of mapping tools, including an interface for Google viewer; 7) estimation of trawled area. Here we report a sample workflow for the accessory sample datasets (available with the package) in order to explore the potentialities of VMSbase. In addition, the results of some performance tests on two large datasets (1×10(5) and 1×10(6) VMS signals, respectively) are reported to inform about the time required for the analyses. The results, although merely illustrative, indicate that VMSbase can represent a step forward in extracting and enhancing information from VMS/logbook data for fisheries studies."
https://openalex.org/W2081337005,"Zinc is essential for the proper functioning of various enzymes and transcription factors, and its homeostasis is rigorously controlled by zinc transporters (SLC39/ZIP, importers; SLC30/ZnT, exporters). Skin disease is commonly caused by a zinc deficiency. Dietary and inherited zinc deficiencies are known to cause alopecia and the development of vesicular or pustular dermatitis. A previous study demonstrated that zinc played crucial roles in the survival of keratinocytes and their unique functions. High levels of zinc have been detected in the epidermis. Epidermal layers are considered to use a mechanism that preferentially takes in zinc, which is involved with the unique functions of keratinocytes. However, few studies have investigated the ZIP (Zrt- and Irt-like protein) proteins specifically expressed in keratinocytes and their functions. We explored the ZIP proteins specifically expressed in the epidermis and analyzed their functions. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of ZIP2 was consistently higher in the epidermis than in the dermis. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the expression of ZIP2 in differentiating keratinocytes. The expression of ZIP2 was found to be up-regulated by the differentiation induction of cultured keratinocytes. Intracellular zinc levels were decreased in keratinocytes when ZIP2 was knocked down by siRNA, and this subsequently inhibited the differentiation of keratinocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZIP2 knockdown inhibited the normal formation of a three-dimensional cultured epidermis. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that ZIP2, a zinc transporter expressed specifically in the epidermis, and zinc taken up by ZIP2 are necessary for the differentiation of keratinocytes.

Approximately 99% of elements that constitute the human body are carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. Although zinc accounts for only 0.003% of elements in the human body, it is essential for the active center formation of over 300 types of enzymes and maintenance of transcription factors (1Maret W. Li Y. Coordination dynamics of zinc in proteins.Chem Rev. 2009; 109: 4682-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Furthermore, according to recent studies on the human genome sequence, ∼4–10% of the proteins coded by all genes contain zinc-biding domains (2Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. Counting the zinc-proteins encoded in the human genome.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Therefore, intracellular zinc levels are rigorously controlled by zinc transporters (3Kambe T. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sasaki R. Nagao M. Overview of mammalian zinc transporters.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 49-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 4Fukada T. Kambe T. Molecular and genetic features of zinc transporters in physiology and pathogenesis.Metallomics. 2011; 3: 662-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Zinc transporters have been roughly classified into two families: SLC39 (ZIP) and SLC30 (ZnT). SLC39 (ZIP) up-regulates, whereas SLC30 (ZnT) down-regulates zinc levels in the cytoplasm. Fourteen types of ZIP proteins and eight types of ZnT proteins have been identified in human cells (5Eide D.J. Zinc transporters and the cellular trafficking of zinc.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Skin disease is commonly caused by a zinc deficiency. Dietary and inherited zinc deficiencies cause alopecia and the development of vesicular or pustular dermatitis. Although it has been detected in locations all over the body, zinc is known to be particularly abundantly in the skin (6Underwood E.J. Trace Elements in Human and Animal Nutrition. 4th Ed. Academic Press, New York1977: 196-242Crossref Google Scholar). Taking these findings together, zinc is suspected of being a significant element in skin tissues. The skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous adipose layer. The epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, is primarily composed of keratinocytes (∼90% of all epidermal cells) (7Sun T.T. Shih C. Green H. Keratin cytoskeletons in epithelial cells of internal organs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes differentiate from basal epidermal stem cells and migrate toward the surface of the epidermis as they mature. Therefore, the epidermis consists of several layers (basal, spinous, granular, and cornified layers) that are classified according to the stage of differentiation. Epidermal stem cells undergo a cycle of proliferation and differentiation when needed to supply keratinocytes to the epidermis, which is responsible for the continuance renewal of the skin. This process has been referred to as the turnover of the epidermis. Keratinocytes express various differentiation markers during their differentiation. For example, involucrin (IVL) 2The abbreviations used are: IVLinvolucrinNHEKnormal human epidermal keratinocyteNTnon-targetingSFMserum-free medium. is expressed in the upper spinous and granular layers in which differentiation is at an advanced stage, whereas IVL is not expressed in the basal layer (8Yamazaki T. Nakano H. Hayakari M. Tanaka M. Mayama J. Tsuchida S. Differentiation induction of human keratinocytes by phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32191-32195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The abnormal proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes cause various skin diseases. For example, psoriasis is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia because of the hyperproliferation and failure of differentiation of keratinocytes (9Hodge L. Comaish J.S. Psoriasis: current concepts in management.Drugs. 1977; 13: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Voorhees J.J. Pathophysiology of psoriasis.Annu. Rev. Med. 1977; 28: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the turnover of epidermal layers need to be clarified to elucidate the pathogenesis of skin diseases. We believe that trace metals (particularly zinc) are closely associated with the turnover of epidermal layers. involucrin normal human epidermal keratinocyte non-targeting serum-free medium. A number of studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of zinc on keratinocytes. For example, apoptosis has been reported in keratinocytes cultured under zinc-deficient conditions or high zinc conditions. Therefore, an appropriate concentration of zinc is crucial for the survival of keratinocytes (11Wilson D. Varigos G. Ackland M.L. Apoptosis may underlie the pathology of zinc-deficient skin.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Stork C.J. Martorano L.M. Li Y.V. UVB radiation induces an increase in intracellular zinc in human epidermal keratinocytes.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2010; 26: 463-469PubMed Google Scholar). Sakamoto et al. (13Sakamoto M. Tzeng S. Fukuyama K. Epstein W.L. Light-scattering studies of cation-stimulated filament assembly of newborn rat epidermal keratin.Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1980; 624: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) demonstrated that zinc is involved in the polymerization of cytokeratin. Furthermore, Deters et al. (14Deters A. Schnetz E. Schmidt M. Hensel A. Effects of zinc histidine and zinc sulfate on natural human keratinocytes.Forsch. Komplementarmed. Klass. Naturheilkd. 2003; 10: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar) reported that zinc promoted the generation of IVL, a differentiation marker, when it was added to keratinocytes. These findings indicate that zinc plays crucial roles in the survival of keratinocytes and their unique functions. Zinc has also been shown to be present at high levels in the epidermis (15Michaëlsson G. Ljunghall K. Danielson B.G. Zinc in epidermis and dermis in healthy subjects.Acta Derm. Venereol. 1980; 60: 295-299PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal layers may use a mechanism that takes in zinc preferentially, which is involved with the unique functions of keratinocytes. However, few studies have investigated the ZIP proteins specifically expressed in keratinocytes and their functions. In this study, we explored the ZIP proteins specifically expressed in the epidermal layers and analyzed their functions. The synchrotron radiation experiments were performed at the BL37XU of SPring-8 with the approval of the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute (JASRI, Hyogo, Japan) (Proposals 2012B1394 and 2013A1327). Healthy human frozen skin (Transkin) purchased from KAC (Kyoto, Japan) was used for the analysis. The skin was cut into 1-cm-wide pieces with a scalpel and were then embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (optimal cutting temperature) compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) to prepare 20-μm-thick frozen sections with a microtome. The thinly sliced sections were pasted on 4 × 4 cm2 Kapton film 30EN (Toray Industries, Tokyo, Japan) and stored frozen as specimens for SR-XRF analysis. SR-XRF analysis was performed on the basis of the study by Kodera et al. (16Kodera H. Nishioka H. Muramatsu Y. Terada Y. Distribution of lead in the lead-accumulating pteridophyte Blechnum nipponicum measured by synchrotron radiation micro X-ray fluorescence.Anal. Sci. 2008; 24: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Specifically, specimens were returned to room temperature and used for SR-XRF analysis with a scanning x-ray microscope (BL37XU) at SPring-8. Specimens were irradiated with a 20-keV, 0.8(H) × 0.6(V) μm2 beam to determine the distribution and amounts of elements (zinc, iron, copper, and sulfur) in the skin sections. Cross-sections of skin specimens were scanned by a two-dimensional scanner with a step width of 1 μm to measure the fluorescent x-ray intensity (counts per second) of each metal element. Dorsal skin tissues were collected from HR-1 mice (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) and were reacted overnight in 200 units/ml of Dispase II (Godo Shusei, Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C. The epidermal sheet was peeled from the dermis the following day, and RNA was isolated from the tissues for gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissues and cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription. Real-time PCR was performed with the SuperScript III Platinum two-step quantitative real-time PCR kit (Invitrogen), using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The mouse primer sequences used were as follows: Gapdh, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGATG-3′ (antisense); Ivl, 5′-GCAACCAACTCCACATCCTACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CATGTTTGGGAAAGCCCTTCT-3′ (antisense); Col3a1, 5′-TTCCTGAAGATGTCGTTGATGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGTTTTTGCAGTGGTATGTAATGTTC-3′ (antisense); Zip1, 5′-GAGCGACAGCAATGGAGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGGCTGTGATAACTCGGTGAC-3′ (antisense); Zip2, 5′-GTGGCCTTACTCCCATCTACGTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GACCCTGTGGTGATGACCTGTAG-3′ (antisense); Zip3, 5′-TGGGCGTGTTCTTCTTCATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGCGCCTTCTCCAAGTCAG-3′ (antisense); Zip6, 5′-TACAGCAAGTGAGAAGAAGGCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAAGCCAGGCTATTTGTAAAG-3′ (antisense); Zip8, 5′-GCTGCACTTCAACCAGTGTTTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGACATTTGAGAAACCATGAAGA-3′ (antisense); Zip10, 5′-TCTGCATCTACTGCCCCATTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGTGCGTATGCTGATGACTG-3′ (antisense); and Zip14, 5′-TTCCCAGCCCAAGGAAGGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAAAGAGGTCTCCAGAGCTAAAG-3′ (antisense). The human primer sequences used were as follows: 18 S rRNA, 5′-CCGAGCCGCCTGGATAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGTTCCGAAAACCAACAAAATAGA-3′ (antisense); IVL, 5′-CCATCAGGAGCAAATGAAACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCGACAGGCACCTTCTG-3′ (antisense); ZIP1, 5′-GCGCCTACCCTCATACCTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGCCAGAGAAGATACCAAA-3′ (antisense); ZIP2, 5′-GGTCATCACCGGCGAGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCAGGGCTTCAGCAGTCATA-3′ (antisense); and ZIP3, 5′-CGGGAGTTGCTGGACTGAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCAAGTCCCACGATGTGCTAC-3′ (antisense). The contents of the selected genes were normalized to Gapdh and 18 S rRNA. All PCR products were checked by melting curve analysis to exclude the possibility of multiple products or incorrect product sizes. PCR analyses were conducted in triplicate for each sample. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections prepared from skin biopsies were deparaffinized. The media with the anti-KRT14 rabbit polyclonal (Covance, Princeton, NJ), anti-IVL rabbit polyclonal (Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA), and anti-ZIP2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abnova Corp., Taipei, Taiwan) at a dilution of 1:200 were introduced into the skin sections, which were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed in PBS, the sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were then washed in PBS, and 1 μg/ml DAPI solution (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to confirm the presence of cell nuclei. Immortalized human keratinocytes (human dermal keratinocyte 1, HDK1) were provided by Dr. Akihiro Umezawa (Department of Reproductive Biology, National Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. Tohru Kiyono (National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) were purchased from Cell Applications Inc. (San Diego, CA). HDK1 and NHEKs were grown routinely in the low-Ca2+ medium Keratinocyte-SFM (serum-free medium) (KSFM, Invitrogen) for propagation. Differentiation was induced by elevating the calcium level in the cell culture medium by the addition of calcium chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). HDK1 and NHEKs were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 30 min before the detection of IVL with immunofluorescence. Media with the anti IVL rabbit polyclonal antibody (Spring Bioscience) at a dilution of 1:200 were introduced into the culture dish, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed in PBS, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS, and 1 μg/ml DAPI solution (Dojindo Laboratories) was added to confirm the presence of cell nuclei. Cells were lysed with 2% SDS. Total protein was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Yokohama, Japan). Samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted with the primary antibody, anti-IVL rabbit polyclonal antibody (Spring Bioscience, 1:1000), and anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, England, 1:5000). Blots were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence (ECL Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. To measure intracellular zinc levels in HDK1, cells were loaded with 1 μm cell-permeant FluoZin-3 AM (acetoxymethyl) (Invitrogen) in plain DMEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were further incubated in fresh plain DMEM for 1 h prior to measuring intracellular zinc levels by flow cytometric analysis (FACSAria, BD Biosciences). The chelexing process of culture medium (KSFM) was done by treatment with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The concentration of zinc in chelexed KSFM was analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (furnace) (GFA-7000, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Differentiation was induced by elevating the calcium level in the chelexed KSFM by addition of calcium chloride. Cells were seeded in Keratinocyte-SFM the day before transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and with 20 nm of Stealth siRNAs (Invitrogen), HSS179136 (si-1), HSS179137 (si-2), and HSS179138 (si-3) against human ZIP2 with non-targeting (NT) siRNA as a control. The medium was changed to differentiation medium 4 h after transfection, and assays were performed after 4 days. Cells were fixed with methanol for 20 min and stained with Giemsa solution (Sigma) for 30 min. HDK1 were seeded in 96-well plates (0.3 × 104 cells/well), and siRNA transfection was performed as mentioned above. The medium was changed to differentiation medium 4 h after transfection, and the cell proliferation assay was performed after 4 days. The relative cell number was measured with cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8, Dojindo Laboratories) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. In brief, after removing the medium, 100 μl of CCK-8 solution was added to cells, which were then incubated for another hour. Optical density values were tested at an absorbance of 450 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The culture was made on the basis of the Millicell hanging cell culture insert (polyethylene terephthalate, 0.4 μm, Millipore, Billerica, MA). HDK1 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/insert in 0.4 ml of expansion medium (CNT-07, CELLnTEC, Bern, Switzerland). The inserts were then placed in a 24-well plate with 1 ml of CNT-07 medium added to the well. The culture was maintained for 24 h before siRNA transfection. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and 100 nm of Stealth siRNAs (Invitrogen) against human ZIP2 with NT siRNA as a control. Cells were first grown in CNT-07 medium for 48–72 h until 100% confluence and were then maintained in three-dimensional medium (CNT-02-3DP5, CELLnTEC). The medium in the insert was aspirated after 16 h, and the cells were exposed to air. The medium in the wells was also refreshed. The three-dimensional culture was then maintained for 5 days by changing the medium every other day. Samples were then collected for immunohistological analysis. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. Multiple groups were evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons. SR-XRF analysis using human skin tissue was initially conducted to identify the distribution patterns of trace metal elements. The results obtained showed that zinc was localized in the epidermal layers and that iron was localized abundantly in the basal layer. On the other hand, the distribution of both copper and sulfur in the epidermis and dermis was nearly uniform (Fig. 1). We confirmed that zinc was specifically localized in the epidermal layers and, therefore, hypothesized the presence of ZIP proteins that exclusively take up zinc in the epidermal layers. Gene expression analysis was conducted by real-time PCR using the skin tissue of HR-1 male mice aged 0, 3, and 28 days to analyze the expression of ZIP (Zip) in epidermal and dermal tissues. The analysis was conducted specifically on Zip (Zip1-Zip6, Zip8, Zip10, and Zip14) associated with the uptake of zinc into cells (17Fukada T. Yamasaki S. Nishida K. Murakami M. Hirano T. Zinc homeostasis and signaling in health and diseases: Zinc signaling.J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2011; 16: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The dorsal skins were collected from HR-1 mice, and the epidermis and dermis were separated using Dispase II. RNA was then isolated from the tissues for use in gene expression analysis. Markers for the epidermis and dermis, Ivl and Col3a1, respectively, were confirmed to be specifically expressed in each tissue, which confirmed that each tissue was separated properly. Among the nine types of Zip, the expression of Zip2 only was higher in the epidermis than in the dermis, regardless of aging (Fig. 2). Therefore, this result suggests that ZIP2 (Zip2) may be associated with the specific functions of keratinocytes. The expression of Zip4 and Zip5 was not detected in either the epidermis or dermis (data not shown). Mouse skin sections were immunostained to analyze the localization of Zip2 in the skin tissue. The results obtained showed that Zip2 was specifically expressed in the epidermis, which was consistent with the results of the gene expression analysis (Fig. 3a). The expression of Zip2 was not confirmed in the basal layer but was in the differentiated keratinocytes in the upper layer. Furthermore, the expression patterns of ZIP2 were analyzed in detail using human skin tissue. The basal layer of human skin tissue was composed of undifferentiated keratinocytes that expressed KRT14 (Fig. 3b). Differentiated keratinocytes expressed IVL, a differentiation marker, in the upper layer (Fig. 3c). The expression of ZIP2 was specifically confirmed in the upper layer of the epidermis, as in the study using the mouse skin (Fig. 3d). Taken together, these results suggest that ZIP2 (Zip2) may be associated with the differentiation of keratinocytes. HDK1, immortalized human keratinocytes, were induced to differentiate under high calcium conditions (1.5 mm or 3.0 mm) to examine changes in the expression of ZIP2 associated with the differentiation of keratinocytes (18Xue M. Thompson P. Kelso I. Jackson C. Activated protein C stimulates proliferation, migration and wound closure, inhibits apoptosis and upregulates MMP-2 activity in cultured human keratinocytes.Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HDK1 exhibited a flattened and cobblestone morphology during the induction of differentiation (Fig. 4a). Western blotting and immunostaining revealed that the expression of IVL was up-regulated by the induction of differentiation (Fig. 4, b and c). Gene expression analysis by real-time PCR showed that the expression of ZIP2 was up-regulated, similar to that of IVL (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, the expression of other ZIP proteins (ZIP1 and ZIP3) remained unchanged. Taken together, these results suggest that ZIP2 may be associated with the differentiation of keratinocytes. Staining with the zinc indicator FluoZin-3 revealed that intracellular free zinc levels were significantly higher in HDK1 that highly expressed ZIP2 because of differentiation induction (Fig. 5, b and c).FIGURE 5HDK1 differentiation-related changes in the expression of IVL and ZIP. a, gene expression analysis by real-time PCR.

As a result, HDK1 exhibited a cobblestone morphology after differentiation, as usual in the negative control (NT siRNA) group, whereas HDK1 did not exhibit a cobblestone morphology in the ZIP2 knockdown group (Fig. 6, a and b). Gene expression analysis by real-time PCR revealed that the expression of IVL was down-regulated significantly by ZIP2 knockdown (Fig. 6a), and this was also confirmed by immunostaining (Fig. 6c). Intracellular zinc levels were significantly lower in the si-pool group than in the NT group (Fig. 6, d and e). Next, excessive amounts of zinc, which were 10 times (5 μm) and 100 times (50 μm) the amount originally contained in the medium, were added to ZIP2 knockdown HDK1 to examine whether the differentiation could be restored. The result showed that 50 μm of ZnCl2 (Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) restored the differentiation of HDK1 (Fig. 7, a and b). These results suggest that ZIP2 and zinc taken up by ZIP2 are necessary for the differentiation of keratinocytes.FIGURE 7Effects of the addition of excessive amounts of zinc and the removal of zinc on the differentiation of HDK1. a, gene expression analysis of IVL on day 4 of differentiation induction.

No change was detected in the intracellular zinc level (Fig. 7, e and f). Meanwhile, the expression of ZIP2 was enhanced notably (Fig. 7d). Giemsa staining showed that HDK1 did not exhibit a cobblestone morphology but was diffused in the entire dish in the ZIP2 knockdown group (Fig. 8a). In addition, the ratio of proliferation marker Ki67-positive cells was increased by ZIP2 knockdown, which promoted the proliferation of HDK1 (Fig. 8, b and c). An experiment using NHEKs revealed that the expression of ZIP2 increased simultaneously with differentiation (Fig. 9, a and b), whereas differentiation was inhibited when ZIP2 was knocked down (Fig. 9, c and d).FIGURE 9Effects of ZIP2 knockdown on the differentiation of NHEKs. a, morphological changes associated with the differentiation of NHEKs on day 4 of differentiation.

In the negative control group, the expression of KRT14, a marker of an undifferentiated keratinocyte, was confirmed only in the basal layer, and the expression of IVL, a differentiation marker, was confirmed in the upper layer. In addition, the nuclei of keratinocytes in the cornified layer disappeared, which suggests that keratinocytes underwent normal differentiation (Figs. 3, b and c, and 10a). On the other hand, in the ZIP2 knockdown group, the expression of KRT14 was confirmed not only in the basal layer but also in the upper layer. The expression region of IVL was decreased compared with the negative control group. Furthermore, the ZIP2 knockdown group exhibited poor keratinization and nuclei that are supposed to disappear in the cornified layer in keratinocytes (Fig. 10b). These results demonstrate that the differentiation of keratinocytes is suppressed by ZIP2 knockdown. Each element exhibited its own unique distribution pattern in the SR-XRF analysis performed in this study (Fig. 1). Zinc in particular was localized abundantly in the epidermal layers rather than the dermal layers. A neutron activation analysis showed previously that zinc concentrations in the epidermis were approximately six times greater than those in the dermis (15Michaëlsson G. Ljunghall K. Danielson B.G. Zinc in epidermis and dermis in healthy subjects.Acta Derm. Venereol. 1980; 60: 295-299PubMed Google Scholar). Iron has also been shown to be localized in the area around the basal layer. Previous studies have also suggested the localization of iron around the basal layer (19Pinheiro T. Silva R. Fleming R. Gonçalves A. Barreiros M.A. Silva J.N. Morlière P. Santus R. Filipe P. Distribution and quantitation of skin iron in primary haemochromatosis: correlation with total body iron stores in patients undergoing phlebotomy.Acta Derm. Venereol. 2014; 94: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Ylva W. Linde J. Pallon Forslind B. Physiologically important trace elements of paralesional psoriatic skin.Scanning Microsc. 1998; 12: 599-608Google Scholar), which is consistent with the results obtained in this study. Iron is known to play an important role in cell proliferation (21Hoffbrand A.V. Ganeshaguru K. Hooton J.W. Tattersall M.H. Effect of iron deficiency and desferrioxamine on DNA synthesis in human cells.Br. J. Haematol. 1976; 33: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because the basal layer is composed of keratinocytes that possess a high proliferative potential, these keratinocytes may aggressively take in iron. Further studies are needed to clarify the effects of iron on keratinocytes in the basal layer. In this study, we investigated the roles of zinc localized in the epidermis. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of ZIP2 (Zip2), which plays a role in the uptake of zinc into a cell, was consistently high in the epidermis (Fig. 2). The expression of ZIP2 (Zip2) was confirmed in differentiating keratinocytes in the human and mouse epidermis. The expression of ZIP2 was up-regulated by differentiation induction of HDK1 and NNEK cells. Moreover, this differentiation was inhibited by a down-regulation in the expression of ZIP2 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, 9, and 10), and the inhibited differentiation was restored by the addition of zinc (Fig. 7, a and b). Therefore, ZIP2, which is located upstream of the pathway of differentiation of keratinocytes, and zinc taken up by ZIP2 are necessary for the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. On the other hand, when differentiation of HIDK1 was induced in the culture medium depleted of zinc by treatment with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad), the expression of IVL was not decreased (Fig. 7, c and d). No change was detected in the intracellular zinc level (Fig. 7, e and f). Interestingly, the expression of ZIP2 was enhanced notably (Fig. 7d). This is probably because when keratinocytes sensed the decreased extracellular zinc level, the expression of the zinc uptake protein ZIP2 was enhanced to maintain homeostasis, which resulted in maintaining homeostasis of intracellular zinc. Therefore, the differentiation ability was maintained. In fact, it has been reported that, when enterocytes are deficient in zinc, the expression of the zinc uptake protein ZIP4 is increased (22Kambe T. Andrews G.K. Novel proteolytic processing of the ectodomain of the zinc transporter ZIP4 (SLC39A4) during zinc deficiency is inhibited by acrodermatitis enteropathica mutations.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As for ZIP2, a similar phenomenon was seen in a study using monocytic cells (23Cao J. Bobo J.A. Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. Effects of intracellular zinc depletion on metallothionein and ZIP2 transporter expression and apoptosis.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 559-566PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Zip2 has been reported previously in mouse epidermal tissue during embryogenesis, and Zip2 knockout mice exhibit skin blistering during early embryogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism for this remains unknown (24Peters J.L. Dufner-Beattie J. Xu W. Geiser J. Lahner B. Salt D.E. Andrews G.K. Targeting of the mouse Slc39a2 (Zip2) gene reveals highly cell-specific patterns of expression, and unique functions in zinc, iron, and calcium homeostasis.Genesis. 2007; 45: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Considering the results of our study, it is likely that Zip2 knockout mice developed a deficiency in the skin because of the abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes. ZIP2 is known to exist in the cell membrane and transport zinc into cells, which consequently increases zinc cellular levels (25Rezaei K.A. Chen Y. Cai J. Sternberg P. Modulation of Nrf2-dependent antioxidant functions in the RPE by Zip2, a zinc transporter protein.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because the expression of ZIP2 increased simultaneously with the differentiation of keratinocytes, we speculated that zinc may be taken into a cell simultaneously with differentiation by the mediation of ZIP2. In fact, intracellular zinc levels were increased with the differentiation of HDK1 and decreased by ZIP2 knockdown (Figs. 5, b and c, and 6, d and e). Zinc has been shown to play a role in maintaining the conformation of various proteins, including transcriptional factors and enzymes. Therefore, it is conceivable that the zinc taken up by ZIP2 may control the activation of the zinc-requiring transcriptional factors related to the differentiation of keratinocytes. For example, KLF4, a zinc-requiring transcriptional factor, is known to be expressed in differentiating keratinocytes in the epidermis (26Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Klf4 is a transcription factor required for establishing the barrier function of the skin.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), which coincides with an increase in the expression of ZIP2. As with the case of ZIP2 knockdown, the expression of IVL has been shown to be inhibited when KLF4 was knocked down by siRNA, thereby inhibiting the normal formation of the three-dimensional cultured epidermis (27Chew Y.C. Adhikary G. Xu W. Wilson G.M. Eckert R.L. Protein kinase C δ increases Kruppel-like factor 4 protein, which drives involucrin gene transcription in differentiating keratinocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17759-17768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that zinc-requiring proteins, such as KLF4, which controls the differentiation of keratinocytes, may exist downstream of ZIP2. More studies should be carried out to identify factors lying downstream and upstream of ZIP2. The expression of Zip10 and Zip14 was higher in the dermis than in the epidermis, regardless of aging (Fig. 2), which indicated that Zip10 and Zip14 may be associated with the specific functions of fibroblasts. This study demonstrates that various kinds of trace metals, which exhibit specific distribution patterns, are found in the skin. In particular, zinc and its transporter ZIP2 are present specifically in the epidermis and are closely associated with the differentiation of keratinocytes and turnover of epidermal layers. More studies to elucidate the roles of trace metal elements, including zinc, and their transporters, which affect the maintenance of skin homeostasis, will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of skin homeostasis and various skin diseases.

In spite of their socio-economic importance, the knowledge of Musaceae genomes is basically limited to draft genome assemblies of two species, Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana. Here we aimed to complement this information by analyzing repetitive genome fractions of six species selected to represent various phylogenetic groups within the family.Low-pass sequencing of M. acuminata, M. ornata, M. textilis, M. beccarii, M. balbisiana, and Ensete gilletii genomes was performed using a 454/Roche platform. Sequence reads were subjected to analysis of their overall intra- and inter-specific similarities and, all major repeat families were quantified using graph-based clustering. Maximus/SIRE and Angela lineages of Ty1/copia long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and the chromovirus lineage of Ty3/gypsy elements were found to make up most of highly repetitive DNA in all species (14-34.5% of the genome). However, there were quantitative differences and sequence variations detected for classified repeat families as well as for the bulk of total repetitive DNA. These differences were most pronounced between species from different taxonomic sections of the Musaceae family, whereas pairs of closely related species (M. acuminata/M. ornata and M. beccarii/M. textilis) shared similar populations of repetitive elements.This study provided the first insight into the composition and sequence variation of repetitive parts of Musaceae genomes. It allowed identification of repetitive sequences specific for a single species or a group of species that can be utilized as molecular markers in breeding programs and generated computational resources that will be instrumental in repeat masking and annotation in future genome assembly projects."
https://openalex.org/W2027334075,"Background There has been rapid scale-up of malaria vector control in the last ten years. Both of the primary control strategies, long-lasting pyrethroid treated nets and indoor residual spraying, rely on the use of a limited number of insecticides. Insecticide resistance, as measured by bioassay, has rapidly increased in prevalence and has come to the forefront as an issue that needs to be addressed to maintain the sustainability of malaria control and the drive to elimination. Zambia's programme reported high levels of resistance to the insecticides it used in 2010, and, as a result, increased its investment in resistance monitoring to support informed resistance management decisions. Methodology/Principal Findings A country-wide survey on insecticide resistance in Zambian malaria vectors was performed using WHO bioassays to detect resistant phenotypes. Molecular techniques were used to detect target-site mutations and microarray to detect metabolic resistance mechanisms. Anopheles gambiae s.s. was resistant to pyrethroids, DDT and carbamates, with potential organophosphate resistance in one population. The resistant phenotypes were conferred by both target-site and metabolic mechanisms. Anopheles funestus s.s. was largely resistant to pyrethroids and carbamates, with potential resistance to DDT in two locations. The resistant phenotypes were conferred by elevated levels of cytochrome p450s. Conclusions/Significance Currently, the Zambia National Malaria Control Centre is using these results to inform their vector control strategy. The methods employed here can serve as a template to all malaria-endemic countries striving to create a sustainable insecticide resistance management plan."

Methods The distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the cumulative relative risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI) of cause-specific ERV associated with daily temperature from lag 0 to lag 3 after controlling for potential confounders. Results This study identified that temperatures related to the lowest risk of ERV was 26 °C for cerebrovascular diseases, 18 °C for CRF, DM, and accidents, and 30 °C for hypertensive diseases, asthma, and CAO. These temperatures were used as the reference temperatures to measure RR for the corresponding diseases. A low temperature (14°C) increased the ERV risk for cerebrovascular diseases, hypertensive diseases, and asthma, with respective cumulative 4-day RRs of 1.56 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.97), 1.78 (95% CI: 1.37, 2.34), and 2.93 (95% CI: 1.26, 6.79). The effects were greater on, or after, lag one. At 32°C, the cumulative 4-day RR for ERV was significant for CRF (RR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.19) and accidents (RR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.33) and the highest RR was seen on lag 0 for CRF (RR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.01, 3.58), DM (RR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.61), and accidents (RR = 1.19; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.27).

https://openalex.org/W2154328498,"Background The outcome measures most frequently used in studies on the effectiveness of migraine treatment are whether the patient is free of pain, nausea, and free of photophobia/phonophobia within two hours. However, no patient-centred outcome measures are available. Therefore, we performed an online Delphi procedure to compile a list of outcome measures deemed most important to migraine patients. Methods From a large database of migraine patients, we randomly selected 150 males and 150 females patients. We asked the open-ended question: ‘If a new medicine was developed for migraine attacks, what would you wish the effect of this medication to be?’ In the second and third rounds, we presented the answers of the first round and asked the patients to rate the importance of each item. Results The initial response rate was 56% (n = 169). In the subsequent rounds the response rates were 90% (n = 152), and 97% (n = 147), respectively. Patients wanted their attack medication to treat the headache within 30 min, to prevent the attack from getting worse, to ensure they could function properly within 1 h, and prevent the recurrence of symptoms during the same day. Conclusions The currently used outcome measures in migraine research do not sufficiently reflect the wishes of patients. Patients want the medication to work faster, to take away pain at an earlier stage, to make them able to function properly quickly, and to prevent recurrence. These aspects should be considered in future evaluation of new attack medication for migraine."

The current study evaluated the interventional effects of a naturally occurring compound Notoginsenoside R1 (NR1) on atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.The atherosclerotic lesion was significantly alleviated by NR1 treatment and this attenuation was marked by reduction in lipid deposition, fibrosis and oxidative stress. Increased serum levels of GSH and SOD and decreased level of MDH were observed in NR1-treated ApoE-/- mice. NR1 treatment also significantly decreased the levels of CHO, TG, ox-LDL and increased the level of HDL. Additionally, the levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α and γ-IFN were markedly reduced in NR1-treated ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, significantly increased aortic expression of miR-26a, miR-21, miR-126a, miR-132, miR-146 and miR-155 and decreased expression of miR-20a and miR-92a were observed in the vehicle-treated ApoE-/- mice. While NR1 treatment led to a significant reduction in the expression of miR-21, miR-26a, miR-126 and increased expression of miR-20a.Collectively, our results demonstrated for the first time the anti-atherosclerotic effects of NR1, which could be in part mediated through its multiple targeting effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and microRNA expression.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical and functional significance of ectopic podoplanin (gp38) expression by RA SF. Methods Expression of gp38 and its CLEC2 receptor was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in synovial arthroscopic biopsies from RA patients and normal and osteoarthritic controls. Correlation between gp38 expression and RA clinicopathological variables was analyzed. In patients rebiopsied after anti-TNF-α therapy, changes in gp38 expression were determined. Platelet-SF coculture and gp38 silencing in SF were used to analyze the functional contribution of gp38 to SF migratory and invasive properties, and to SF platelet crosstalk. Results gp38 was abundantly but variably expressed in RA, and it was undetectable in normal synovial tissues. Among clinicopathologigal RA variables, significantly increased gp38 expression was only found in patients with lymphoid neogenesis (LN), and RF or ACPA autoantibodies. Cultured synovial but not dermal fibroblasts showed strong constitutive gp38 expression that was further induced by TNF-α. In RA patients, anti-TNF-α therapy significantly reduced synovial gp38 expression. In RA synovium, CLEC2 receptor expression was only observed in platelets. gp38 silencing in cultured SF did not modify their migratory and invasive properties but reduced the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 genes induced by SF-platelet interaction. Conclusions In RA, synovial expression of gp38 is strongly associated to LN and it is reduced after anti-TNF-α therapy. Interaction between gp38 and CLEC2 platelet receptor is feasible in RA synovium in vivo and can specifically contribute to gene expression by SF."

It has high nutritional value, and its medicinal properties have led to extensive use in traditional oriental medicine. The characterization of genotypes using molecular markers is important for genetic studies and plant breeding. However, few simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers are available for this species. In this study, 1,488 unique SSR clones were isolated from Z. jujuba ‘Dongzao’ using enriched genomic libraries coupled with a three-primer colony PCR screening strategy, yielding a high enrichment rate of 73.3%. Finally, 1,188 (80.87%) primer pairs were amplified successfully in the size expected for ‘Dongzao’. A total of 350 primer pairs were further selected and evaluated for their ability to detect polymorphisms across a panel of six diverse cultivars; among these, 301 primer pairs detected polymorphisms, and the polymorphism information content (PIC) value across all loci ranged from 0.15 to 0.82, with an average of 0.52. An analysis of 76 major cultivars employed in Chinese jujube production using 31 primer pairs revealed comparatively high genetic diversity among these cultivars. Within-population differences among individuals accounted for 98.2% of the observed genetic variation. Neighbor-joining clustering divided the cultivars into three main groups, none of which correspond to major geographic regions, suggesting that the genetics and geographical origin of modern Chinese jujube cultivars might not be linked. The current work firstly reports the large-scale development of Chinese jujube SSR markers. The development of these markers and their polymorphic information represent a significant improvement in the available Chinese jujube genomic resources and will facilitate both genetic and breeding applications, further accelerating the development of new cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2056542068,"Using glucose time series data from a well measured population drawn from an electronic health record (EHR) repository, the variation in predictability of glucose values quantified by the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI) was explained using a mechanistic endocrine model and manual and automated review of written patient records. The results suggest that predictability of glucose varies with health state where the relationship (e.g., linear or inverse) depends on the source of the acuity. It was found that on a fine scale in parameter variation, the less insulin required to process glucose, a condition that correlates with good health, the more predictable glucose values were. Nevertheless, the most powerful effect on predictability in the EHR subpopulation was the presence or absence of variation in health state, specifically, in- and out-of-control glucose versus in-control glucose. Both of these results are clinically and scientifically relevant because the magnitude of glucose is the most commonly used indicator of health as opposed to glucose dynamics, thus providing for a connection between a mechanistic endocrine model and direct insight to human health via clinically collected data."
https://openalex.org/W2061354600,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major multidrug resistant pathogen responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. Clinical Hetero-resistant (HeR) MRSA strains, mostly associated with persistent infections, are composed of mixed cell populations that contain organisms with low levels of resistance (hetero-resistant HeR) and those that display high levels of drug resistance (homo-resistant HoR). However, the full understanding of β-lactam-mediated HeR/HoR selection remains to be completed. In previous studies we demonstrated that acquisition of the HoR phenotype during exposure to β-lactam antibiotics depended on two key elements: (1) activation of the SOS response, a conserved regulatory network in bacteria that is induced in response to DNA damage, resulting in increased mutation rates, and (2) adaptive metabolic changes redirecting HeR-MRSA metabolism to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in order to increase the energy supply for cell-wall synthesis. In the present work, we identified that both main mechanistic components are associated through TCA cycle-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which temporally affects DNA integrity and triggers activation of the SOS response resulting in enhanced mutagenesis. The present work brings new insights into a role of ROS generation on the development of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in a model of natural occurrence, emphasizing the cytoprotective role in HeR-MRSA survival mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2068633034,"The p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway plays an important role in inflammatory and stress responses. MAPKK6 (MKK6), a dual specificity protein kinase, is a p38 activator.

However, the mechanisms underlying deactivation of MKK6-p38, which is crucial for maintaining the magnitude and duration of signal transduction, are not well understood. Lys-48-linked ubiquitination, which marks substrates for proteasomal degradation, is an important negative posttranslational regulatory machinery for signal pathway transduction.

Our results show that FBXO31 binds to MKK6 and mediates its Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby functioning as a negative regulator of MKK6-p38 signaling and protecting cells from stress-induced cell apoptosis. Taken together, our findings uncover a new mechanism of deactivation of MKK6-p38 and substantiate a novel regulatory role of FBXO31 in stress response. The p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway plays an important role in inflammatory and stress responses. MAPKK6 (MKK6), a dual specificity protein kinase, is a p38 activator. Activation of the MKK6-p38 pathway is kept in check by multiple layers of regulations, including autoinhibition, dimerization, scaffold proteins, and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination. However, the mechanisms underlying deactivation of MKK6-p38, which is crucial for maintaining the magnitude and duration of signal transduction, are not well understood. Lys-48-linked ubiquitination, which marks substrates for proteasomal degradation, is an important negative posttranslational regulatory machinery for signal pathway transduction.

https://openalex.org/W2031106358,"In a reaction time task, people typically slow down following an error or conflict, each called post-error slowing (PES) and post-conflict slowing (PCS). Despite many studies of the cognitive mechanisms, the neural responses of PES and PCS continue to be debated. In this study, we combined high-density array EEG and a stop-signal task to examine event-related potentials of PES and PCS in sixteen young adult participants. The results showed that the amplitude of N2 is greater during PES but not PCS. In contrast, the peak latency of N2 is longer for PCS but not PES. Furthermore, error-positivity (Pe) but not error-related negativity (ERN) was greater in the stop error trials preceding PES than non-PES trials, suggesting that PES is related to participants' awareness of the error. Together, these findings extend earlier work of cognitive control by specifying the neural correlates of PES and PCS in the stop signal task."
https://openalex.org/W1970266620,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with a strong inflammatory component. The cytokines interleukin-1β and interferon-γ contribute to beta cell apoptosis in type 1 diabetes. These cytokines induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), contributing to the loss of beta cells. IRE1α, one of the UPR mediators, triggers insulin degradation and inflammation in beta cells and is critical for the transition from ""physiological"" to ""pathological"" UPR. The mechanisms regulating inositol-requiring protein 1α (IRE1α) activation and its signaling for beta cell ""adaptation,"" ""stress response,"" or ""apoptosis"" remain to be clarified. To address these questions, we combined mammalian protein-protein interaction trap-based IRE1α interactome and functional genomic analysis of human and rodent beta cells exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines to identify novel cytokine-induced regulators of IRE1α. Based on this approach, we identified N-Myc interactor (NMI) as an IRE1α-interacting/modulator protein in rodent and human pancreatic beta cells. An increased expression of NMI was detected in islets from nonobese diabetic mice with insulitis and in rodent or human beta cells exposed in vitro to the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interferon-γ. Detailed mechanistic studies demonstrated that NMI negatively modulates IRE1α-dependent activation of JNK and apoptosis in rodent and human pancreatic beta cells. In conclusion, by using a combined omics approach, we identified NMI induction as a novel negative feedback mechanism that decreases IRE1α-dependent activation of JNK and apoptosis in cytokine-exposed beta cells"
https://openalex.org/W2025759276,"Denoising is critical for improving visual quality and reliability of associative quantitative analysis when magnetic resonance (MR) images are acquired with low signal-to-noise ratios. The classical non-local means (NLM) filter, which averages pixels weighted by the similarity of their neighborhoods, is adapted and demonstrated to effectively reduce Rician noise without affecting edge details in MR magnitude images. However, the Rician NLM (RNLM) filter usually blurs small high-contrast particle details which might be clinically relevant information. In this paper, we investigated the reason of this particle blurring problem and proposed a novel particle-preserving RNLM filter with combined patch and pixel (RNLM-CPP) similarity. The results of experiments on both synthetic and real MR data demonstrate that the proposed RNLM-CPP filter can preserve small high-contrast particle details better than the original RNLM filter while denoising MR images."
https://openalex.org/W2079010888,"Abnormal excitatory glutamate neurotransmission and plasticity have been implicated in schizophrenia and affective disorders. Gria1−/− mice lacking GluA1 subunit (encoded by Gria1 gene) of AMPA-type glutamate receptor show robust novelty-induced hyperactivity, social deficits and heightened approach features, suggesting that they could be used to test for anti-manic activity of drugs. Here, we tested the efficacy of chronic treatment with established anti-manic drugs on behavioural properties of the Gria1−/− mice. The mice received standard mood stabilizers (lithium and valproate) and novel ones (topiramate and lamotrigine, used more as anticonvulsants) as supplements in rodent chow for at least 4 weeks. All drugs attenuated novelty-induced locomotor hyperactivity of the Gria1−/− mice, especially by promoting the habituation, while none of them attenuated 2-mg/kg amphetamine-induced hyperactivity as compared to control diet. Treatment with lithium and valproate reversed the elevated exploratory activity of Gria1−/− mice. Valproate treatment also reduced struggling behaviour in tail suspension test and restored reciprocally-initiated social contacts of Gria1−/− mice to the level shown by the wild-type Gria1+/+ mice. Gria1−/− mice consumed slightly more sucrose during intermittent sucrose exposure than the wild-types, but ran similar distances on running wheels. These behaviours were not consistently affected by lithium and valproate in the Gria1−/− mice. The efficacy of various anti-manic drug treatments on novelty-induced hyperactivity suggests that the Gria1−/− mouse line can be utilized in screening for new therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2048453074,"Cupredoxins are widespread copper-binding proteins, mainly involved in electron transfer pathways. They display a typical rigid greek key motif consisting of an eight stranded β-sandwich. A fascinating feature of cupredoxins is the natural diversity of their copper center geometry. These geometry variations give rise to drastic changes in their color, such as blue, green, red or purple. Based on several spectroscopic and structural analyses, a connection between the geometry of their copper-binding site and their color has been proposed. However, little is known about the relationship between such diversity of copper center geometry in cupredoxins and possible implications for function. This has been difficult to assess, as only a few naturally occurring green and red copper sites have been described so far. We report herein the spectrocopic characterization of a novel kind of single domain cupredoxin of green color, involved in a respiratory pathway of the acidophilic organism Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterization coupled to bioinformatics analysis reveal the existence of some unusual features for this novel member of the green cupredoxin sub-family. This protein has the highest redox potential reported to date for a green-type cupredoxin. It has a constrained green copper site insensitive to pH or temperature variations. It is a green-type cupredoxin found for the first time in a respiratory pathway. These unique properties might be explained by a region of unknown function never found in other cupredoxins, and by an unusual length of the loop between the second and the fourth copper ligands. These discoveries will impact our knowledge on non-engineered green copper sites, whose involvement in respiratory chains seems more widespread than initially thought."
https://openalex.org/W2162966619,"Resveratrol has been widely reported to reduce cancer progression in model systems and to selectively induce cell death in transformed cell lines. Many enzymes have been reported to respond to resveratrol in mammalian cells, including the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) protein kinase that acts in DNA damage recognition, signaling, and repair. Here we investigate the responses of ATM to resveratrol exposure in normal and transformed human cell lines and find that ATM autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation is stimulated by resveratrol in a manner that is promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS). We observe direct stimulatory effects of resveratrol on purified ATM in vitro and find that the catalytic efficiency of the kinase on a model substrate is increased by resveratrol. In the purified system we also observe a requirement for oxidation, as the effect of resveratrol on ATM signaling is substantially reduced by agents that prevent disulfide bond formation in ATM. These results demonstrate that resveratrol effects on ATM are direct, and suggest a mechanism by which the oxidizing environment of transformed cells promotes ATM activity and blocks cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1977366125,"The principal obstacles in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are delayed and inaccurate diagnosis which often leads to the onset of the drug resistant TB cases. To avail the appropriate treatment of the patients and to hinder the transmission of drug-resistant TB, accurate and rapid detection of resistant isolates is critical. Present study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of molecular techniques inclusive of line probe assay (LPA) and GeneXpert MTB/RIF methods for the detection of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. Sputum samples from 300 different categories of treated and new TB cases were tested for the detection of possible mutation in the resistance specific genes (rpoB, inhA and katG) through Genotype MTBDRplus assay or LPA and GeneXpert MTB/RIF tests. Culture based conventional drug susceptibility test (DST) was also carried out to measure the efficacy of the molecular methods employed. Among 300 samples, 191 (63.7%) and 193 (64.3%) cases were found to be resistant against rifampicin in LPA and GeneXpert methods, respectively; while 189 (63%) cases of rifampicin resistance were detected by conventional DST methods. On the other hand, 196 (65.3%) and 191 (63.7%) isolates showed isoniazid resistance as detected by LPA and conventional drug susceptibility test (DST), respectively. Among the drug resistant isolates (collectively 198 in LPA and 193 in conventional DST), 189 (95.6%) and 187 (96.9%) were considered to be MDR as examined by LPA and conventional DST, respectively. Category-II and -IV patients encountered higher frequency of drug resistance compared to those from category-I and new cases. Considering the higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy along with the required time to results significantly shorter, our study supports the adoption of LPA and GeneXpert assay as efficient tools in detecting drug resistant TB in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W2035042484,"The antimicrobial activity of phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides against Staphylococcus aureus PheRS are dependent upon phenylalanine levels in the extracellular fluids. Inhibitor efficacy in animal models of infection is substantially diminished by dietary phenylalanine intake, thereby reducing the perceived clinical utility of this inhibitor class. The search for novel antibacterial compounds against Gram-negative pathogens led to a re-evaluation of this phenomenon, which is shown here to be unique to S. aureus. Inhibition of macromolecular syntheses and characterization of novel resistance mutations in Escherichia coli demonstrate that antimicrobial activity of phenyl-thiazolylurea-sulfonamides is mediated by PheRS inhibition, validating this enzyme as a viable drug discovery target for Gram-negative pathogens. A search for novel inhibitors of PheRS yielded three novel chemical starting points. NMR studies were used to confirm direct target engagement for phenylalanine-competitive hits. The crystallographic structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PheRS defined the binding modes of these hits and revealed an auxiliary hydrophobic pocket that is positioned adjacent to the phenylalanine binding site. Three viable inhibitor-resistant mutants were mapped to this pocket, suggesting that this region is a potential liability for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2119665698,"Sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean caused by Fusarium virguliforme spreads and reduces soybean yields through the North Central region of the U.S. The fungal pathogen and Heterodera glycines are difficult to manage.The objective was to determine the contributions of H. glycines and F. virguliforme to SDS severity and effects on soybean yield. To quantify DNA of F. virguliforme in soybean roots and soil, a specific real time qPCR assay was developed. The assay was used on materials from soybean field microplots that contained in a four-factor factorial-design: (i) untreated or methyl bromide-fumigated; (ii) non-infested or infested with F. virguliforme; (iii) non-infested or infested with H. glycines; (iv) natural precipitation or additional weekly watering. In years 2 and 3 of the trial, soil and watering treatments were maintained. Roots of soybean 'Williams 82' were collected for necrosis ratings at the full seed growth stage R6. Foliar symptoms of SDS (area under the disease progress curve, AUDPC), root necrosis, and seed yield parameters were related to population densities of H. glycines and the relative DNA concentrations of F. virguliforme in the roots and soil. The specific and sensitive real time qPCR was used. Data from microplots were introduced into models of AUDPC, root necrosis, and seed yield parameters with the frequency of H. glycines and F. virguliforme, and among each other. The models confirmed the close interrelationship of H. glycines with the development of SDS, and allowed for predictions of disease risk based on populations of these two pathogens in soil.The results modeled the synergistic interaction between H. glycines and F. virguliforme quantitatively in previously infested field plots and explained previous findings of their interaction. Under these conditions, F. virguliforme was mildly aggressive and depended on infection of H. glycines to cause highly severe SDS."
https://openalex.org/W2026730611,"Research on enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) is centered on understanding their role in enamel biomineralization and their bioactivity for tissue engineering. While therapeutic application of EMPs has been widely documented, their expression and biological function in non-enamel tissues is unclear. Our first aim was to screen for amelogenin (AMELX) and ameloblastin (AMBN) gene expression in mandibular bones and soft tissues isolated from adult mice (15 weeks old). Using RT-PCR, we showed mRNA expression of AMELX and AMBN in mandibular alveolar and basal bones and, at low levels, in several soft tissues; eyes and ovaries were RNA-positive for AMELX and eyes, tongues and testicles for AMBN. Moreover, in mandibular tissues AMELX and AMBN mRNA levels varied according to two parameters: 1) ontogenic stage (decreasing with age), and 2) tissue-type (e.g. higher level in dental epithelial cells and alveolar bone when compared to basal bone and dental mesenchymal cells in 1 week old mice). In situ hybridization and immunohistodetection were performed in mandibular tissues using AMELX KO mice as controls. We identified AMELX-producing (RNA-positive) cells lining the adjacent alveolar bone and AMBN and AMELX proteins in the microenvironment surrounding EMPs-producing cells. Western blotting of proteins extracted by non-dissociative means revealed that AMELX and AMBN are not exclusive to mineralized matrix; they are present to some degree in a solubilized state in mandibular bone and presumably have some capacity to diffuse. Our data support the notion that AMELX and AMBN may function as growth factor-like molecules solubilized in the aqueous microenvironment. In jaws, they might play some role in bone physiology through autocrine/paracrine pathways, particularly during development and stress-induced remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2088557075,"CSPG4 marks pericytes, undifferentiated precursors and tumor cells. We assessed whether the shed ectodomain of CSPG4 (sCSPG4) might circulate and reflect potential changes in CSPG4 tissue expression (pCSPG4) due to desmoplastic and malignant aberrations occurring in pancreatic tumors. Serum sCSPG4 was measured using ELISA in test (n = 83) and validation (n = 221) cohorts comprising donors (n = 11+26) and patients with chronic pancreatitis (n = 11+20) or neoplasms: benign (serous cystadenoma SCA, n = 13+20), premalignant (intraductal dysplastic IPMNs, n = 9+55), and malignant (IPMN-associated invasive carcinomas, n = 4+14; ductal adenocarcinomas, n = 35+86). Pancreatic pCSPG4 expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR (n = 139), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. sCSPG4 was found in circulation, but its level was significantly lower in pancreatic patients than in donors. Selective maintenance was observed in advanced IPMNs and PDACs and showed a nodal association while lacking prognostic relevance. Pancreatic pCSPG4 expression was preserved or elevated, whereby neoplastic cells lacked pCSPG4 or tended to overexpress without shedding. Extreme pancreatic overexpression, membranous exposure and tissuehigh/seralow-discordance highlighted stroma-poor benign cystic neoplasm. SCA is known to display hypoxic markers and coincide with von-Hippel-Lindau and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes, in which pVHL and LBK1 mutations affect hypoxic signaling pathways. In vitro testing confined pCSPG4 overexpression to normal mesenchymal but not epithelial cells, and a third of tested carcinoma cell lines; however, only the latter showed pCSPG4-responsiveness to chronic hypoxia. siRNA-based knockdowns failed to reduce the malignant potential of either normoxic or hypoxic cells. Thus, overexpression of the newly established conditional hypoxic indicator, CSPG4, is apparently non-pathogenic in pancreatic malignancies but might mark distinct epithelial lineage and contribute to cell polarity disorders. Surficial retention on tumor cells renders CSPG4 an attractive therapeutic target. Systemic ‘drop and restoration’ alterations accompanying IPMN and PDAC progression indicate that the interference of pancreatic diseases with local and remote shedding/release of sCSPG4 into circulation deserves broad diagnostic exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2028456555,"Common carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) are used as surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, and have been shown to correlate with arterial stiffness, however their correlation with global atherosclerotic burden has not been previously assessed. We compare CIMT and ABPI with atheroma burden as measured by whole body magnetic resonance angiography (WB-MRA).50 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease were recruited. CIMT was measured using ultrasound while rest and exercise ABPI were performed. WB-MRA was performed in a 1.5T MRI scanner using 4 volume acquisitions with a divided dose of intravenous gadolinium gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, FR). The WB-MRA data was divided into 31 anatomical arterial segments with each scored according to degree of luminal narrowing: 0 = normal, 1 = <50%, 2 = 50-70%, 3 = 70-99%, 4 = vessel occlusion. The segment scores were summed and from this a standardized atheroma score was calculated.The atherosclerotic burden was high with a standardised atheroma score of 39.5±11. Common CIMT showed a positive correlation with the whole body atheroma score (β 0.32, p = 0.045), however this was due to its strong correlation with the neck and thoracic segments (β 0.42 p = 0.01) with no correlation with the rest of the body. ABPI correlated with the whole body atheroma score (β -0.39, p = 0.012), which was due to a strong correlation with the ilio-femoral vessels with no correlation with the thoracic or neck vessels. On multiple linear regression, no correlation between CIMT and global atheroma burden was present (β 0.13 p = 0.45), while the correlation between ABPI and atheroma burden persisted (β -0.45 p = 0.005).ABPI but not CIMT correlates with global atheroma burden as measured by whole body contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography in a population with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. However this is primarily due to a strong correlation with ilio-femoral atheroma burden."
https://openalex.org/W2042929965,"Rate of substitution of genomic regions is among the most debated intrinsic features that impact phylogenetic informativeness. However, this variable is also coupled with rates of nonsynonymous substitutions that underscore the nature and degree of selection on the selected genes. To empirically address these variables, we constructed four completely overlapping data sets of plastid matK, atpB, rbcL, and mitochondrial matR genes and used the rosid lineage (angiosperms) as a working platform. The genes differ in combinations of overall rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions. Tree robustness, homoplasy, accuracy in contrast to a reference tree, and phylogenetic informativeness are evaluated. The rapidly evolving/unconstrained matK faired best, whereas remaining genes varied in degrees of contribution to rosid phylogenetics across the lineage's 108 million years evolutionary history. Phylogenetic accuracy was low with the slowly evolving/unconstrained matR despite least amount of homoplasy. Third codon positions contributed the highest amount of parsimony informative sites, resolution and informativeness, but magnitude varied with gene mode of evolution. These findings are in clear contrast with the views that rapidly evolving regions and the 3rd codon position have inevitable negative impact on phylogenetic reconstruction at deep historic level due to accumulation of multiple hits and subsequent elevation in homoplasy and saturation. Relaxed evolutionary constraint in rapidly evolving genes distributes substitutions across codon positions, an evolutionary mode expected to reduce the frequency of multiple hits. These findings should be tested at deeper evolutionary histories."
https://openalex.org/W2073425899,"Background Changes in children’s contact patterns between termtime and school holidays affect the transmission of several respiratory-spread infections. Transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox, has also been linked to the school calendar in several settings, but temporal changes in the proportion of young children attending childcare centres may have influenced this relationship. Methods We used two modelling methods (a simple difference equations model and a Time series Susceptible Infectious Recovered (TSIR) model) to estimate fortnightly values of a contact parameter (the per capita rate of effective contact between two specific individuals), using GP consultation data for chickenpox in England and Wales from 1967–2008. Results The estimated contact parameters were 22–31% lower during the summer holiday than during termtime. The relationship between the contact parameter and the school calendar did not change markedly over the years analysed. Conclusions In England and Wales, reductions in contact between children during the school summer holiday lead to a reduction in the transmission of VZV. These estimates are relevant for predicting how closing schools and nurseries may affect an outbreak of an emerging respiratory-spread pathogen."

Data is lacking of a large cohort of medulloblastoma patients in China. Also, our knowledge on the sensitivity of different molecular subgroups of MB to adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CHT) is still limited. The authors performed a retrospective study of 173 medulloblastoma patients treated at two institutions from 2002 to 2011. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues were available in all the cases and sections were stained to classify histological and molecular subgroups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate prognostic factors. Of 173 patients, there were 118 children and 55 adults, 112 males and 61 females. Estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for all patients, children and adults were 52%, 48% and 63%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, postoperative primary radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CHT) were revealed as favorable prognostic factors influencing OS and EFS. Postoperative primary chemotherapy (CHT) was found significantly improving the survival of children (p<0.001) while it was not a significant prognostic factor for adult patients. Moreover, patients in WNT subtype had better OS (p = 0.028) than others (SHH and Non-SHH/WNT subtypes) given postoperative adjuvant therapies. Postoperative primary RT was found to be a strong prognostic factor influencing the survival in all histological and molecular subgroups (p<0.001). Postoperative primary CHT was found significantly to influence the survival of classic medulloblastoma (CMB) (OS p<0.001, EFS p<0.001), SHH subgroup (OS p = 0.020, EFS p = 0.049) and WNT subgroup (OS p = 0.003, EFS p = 0.016) but not in desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma (DMB) (OS p = 0.361, EFS p = 0.834) and Non-SHH/WNT subgroup (OS p = 0.127, EFS p = 0.055). Our study showed postoperative primary CHT significantly influence the survival of CMB, SHH subgroup and WNT subgroup but not in DMB and Non-SHH/WNT subgroup of MB."

Brodwick M.S. Wang Z.M. Jeong H.J. Choi B.J. Akaike N. The Na+/H+ exchanger is a major pH regulator in GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals synapsing onto rat CA3 pyramidal neurons.J.

Its functional importance is further highlighted by studies of Nhe1 null mice that exhibit ataxia, seizures, and selective loss of neurons in the cerebellum and brainstem (16Cox G.A. Lutz C.M.

However, few deleterious changes were detected in other regions of the brain, implicating compensatory or unique contributions by other NHEs. NHE5 is of particular interest as its expression is largely confined to nervous tissue (19Baird N.R. Orlowski J. Szabó E.Z. Zaun H.C. Schultheis P.J. Menon A.G. Shull G.E.

Unlike NHE1, NHE5 is more resistant to inhibition by amiloride derivatives and benzyolguanidinium-based (e.g. HOE694) compounds (21Raley-Susman K.M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Sapolsky R.M. Kopito R.R.

Regulation of dendritic spine growth through activity-dependent recruitment of brain-enriched Na+/H+ exchanger NHE5.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) found that NHE5 is rapidly recruited to the cell surface of hippocampal neurons in response to NMDA receptor-induced neural activity where it elevates pHi and suppresses growth of postsynaptic dendritic spines. This suggests that vesicular NHE5 may serve as a reservoir of functional transporters that are recruited to the cell surface in response to appropriate cues.

To better understand NHE5 regulation, we screened a human brain cDNA library for NHE5-interacting proteins and identified the α2 catalytic subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a putative partner. AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as a key sensor and master regulator of energy homeostasis at the cellular and organismal levels (26Spasi M.R.

AMPK in health and disease.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 1025-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). AMPK assembles as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory β and γ subunits, each of which is encoded by two or three distinct genes (α1, α2; β1, β2; γ1, γ2, γ3); thus there is a potential to form 12 distinct holoenzymes. The subunit isoforms are widely expressed in peripheral tissues, whereas the brain shows a more restricted pattern, containing predominantly α2, β1, and γ1, and to a lesser extent α1 and β2 (30Turnley A.M. Stapleton D. Mann R.J. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Bartlett P.F. Cellular distribution and developmental expression of AMP-activated protein kinase isoforms in mouse central nervous system.J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1707-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our results show that NHE5 forms a complex with both AMPKα1 and -α2 oligomers and that activation of AMPK regulates hippocampal neuronal pHi in response to metabolic stress-induced acidosis by promoting cell surface accumulation of NHE5. This interaction represents a potentially novel mechanism for coupling energy metabolism to pHi homeostasis in nervous tissue. Chemicals and reagents used for AP-1 cell culture were obtained from either BioShop Canada or Fisher Scientific, with the exception of α-minimum essential medium (αMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA, all of which were purchased from Invitrogen. All products used for neuronal primary cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen, unless otherwise indicated. Protein localization studies using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting were performed using the following commercial antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (HA.11 clone 16B12) (Covance Inc., Berkeley, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal anti-myc (EMD Millipore), rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα1, -α2, -γ1, and -γ2 and mouse monoclonal anti-AMPKα1/2 (Upstate Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKβ (BD Transduction Laboratories), and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα-pT172 antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling).

All other reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. The human NHE5 cDNA corresponding to residues Gly544–Leu896 (cytoplasmic C terminus) was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers (forward, 5′-ATG GCC ATG GCC ATT GGC CAC GTC TTG TCT TCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TAG CCCGGG CTA CAG CCG GCT GCC TCT GTT G-3′) and subcloned into the NcoI and XmaI sites of the pAS2–1 vector (pAS2–1/NHE5(544–896)) (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in-frame with the GAL4 1–147 DNA binding domain. S. cerevisiae strain AH109 (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, his 3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3, GAL2UAS-GAL2TATA-ADE2, ura3::MEL1UAS-MEL1TATA-lacZ) was co-transformed with pAS2–1/NHE5(544–896), carrying the Trp gene and the GAL4 DNA binding domain and a human brain cDNA library cloned into the pACT2 vector (Clontech), carrying the LEU2 gene and the GAL4(768–881) activation domain using the modified lithium acetate method (97Gietz R.D.

Over 2 × 106 clones were screened on the synthetic complete (SC) media containing 0.67% bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories), 2% glucose, 1.5% bacto-agar, and 0.2% -Leu-Trp-His-Ade drop-out mixture and subjected to the β-galactosidase filter assay. For the β-galactosidase filter assay, a replica was taken from each plate onto filter paper (VWR Scientific Products, West Chester, PA), frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen, and incubated with 0.35 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) in buffer containing 6 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.0) at room temperature for up to 4 h. The resulting Leu+, Trp+, His+, Ade+, LacZ+ colonies were streaked on SC-Leu-Trp-His-Ade plates two additional times and single colonies were inoculated into liquid SC, Leu−, Trp+ His−, Ade− media for 3–4 days culture to release the pAS2-1/NHE5(544–896) plasmid. Library-derived cDNA clones in pAC2-1 coding for putative NHE5 interacting proteins were rescued from yeast cells and directly transformed into DH5α cells. The identities of the clones were determined by DNA sequencing and compared against the National Cancer Center for Biotechnology Information database using the BLAST search program. One cDNA clone encoding the AMPKα2 subunit lacking the first 6 amino acids was identified by the two-hybrid screen. To isolate the full-length cDNA, PCR was carried out with the following set of oligonucleotide primers: forward, 5′-CCC AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG GCT GAG AAG CAG AAG CAC GAC GGG CGG GTG AAG ATC GGA C-; reverse, 5′-CGG AAT TCT TAA CGG GCT AAA GTA GTA CTA ATC AGA CTG G-3′ (HindIII and EcoRI sites were underlined). The amplified fragment was subcloned into the pCMV mammalian expression vector at the HindIII and EcoRI sites and the sequence was verified subsequently. To examine NHE1 and NHE5 expression in heterologous cell systems, we used a mammalian expression plasmid (pCMV) containing the rat NHE1 cDNA containing a single influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (-YPYDVPDYA-) at its extreme C terminus (NHE1HA) (31Orlowski J. Heterologous expression and functional properties of the amiloride high affinity (NHE-1) and low affinity (NHE-3) isoforms of the rat Na/H exchanger.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the human NHE5 cDNA tagged with a triple HA-epitope in its first exomembranous loop (NHE5HA3) (23Szaszi K. Paulsen A. Szabo E.Z. Numata M. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycling of the neuron-specific Na+/H+ exchanger NHE5 isoform: regulation by phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and the actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42623-42632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The full-length AMPKα2 cDNA was modified to contain a Myc epitope (-EQKLISEEDL-) at its extreme C terminus (AMPKα2myc). AMPKα2myc was constructed by PCR using the sense oligonucleotide 5′-CCC AAG CTT GCC ACC ATG GCT GAG AAG CAG AAG CAC GAC GGG CGG GTG AAG ATC GGA C-3′ containing a HindIII at the 5′-end and an antisense oligonucleotide containing the coding sequence for the Myc epitope and an XbaI site (5′-GCT CTA GAC TAG TTC AGG TCC TCC TCG CTA ATT AGC TTC TGT TCA ACG GGC TAA AGT AGT AAT CAG ACT GG-3′). The amplified fragment was subcloned into pCMV at the HindIII and XbaI sites, and the fidelity of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. In addition, both NHE5 and AMPKα2 cDNAs were fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein at their respective C termini (NHE5GFP and AMPKα2GFP) using HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites in mammalian expression vector pAcGFP-N1 vector (BD Bioscience). Furthermore, the pAcGFP-N1 vector was used as a base to construct a pAcCherry-N1 vector, whereby GFP was replaced with monomeric cherry fluorescent protein (ChFP) using restriction sites BamHI and NotI. This cloning procedure leaves the multicloning site unaltered, thereby allowing for the analogous construction of both NHE5ChFP and AMPKα2ChFP using HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites. For generating GST fusion proteins, different regions of the NHE5 cDNA were amplified by PCR, excised with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into the same restriction sites of the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (GE Healthcare) in-frame with the amino-terminal GST tag. Transformed BL21 Escherichia coli cells derived from single colonies were inoculated in 5 ml of 2YT + Amp (100 μg/ml) media overnight and protein expression was induced by further incubation in 50 ml of the same media containing 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml of lysozyme and proteinase inhibitor mixtures (Roche Diagnostics) in PBS, incubated on ice for 15 min, and sonicated 4 times for 30 s on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min and an equal amount of the GST fusion proteins (∼10 μg) were purified by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 2 h. Following four washes in lysis buffer without lysozyme, the beads were incubated with 35S-labeled in vitro translated protein generated by the TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). After overnight incubation at 4 °C the beads were washed six times in the same buffer and 35S-labeled TnT protein bound to the GST fusion protein was detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Loading of the proteins was confirmed by Coomassie Blue dye staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. For producing in vitro translated AMPKα2, the full-length AMPKα2 cDNA was ligated into the pCMV vector. The T7 promoter in the vector enabled in vitro transcription translation coupling reaction using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). GST-NHE5 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads and a phosphorylation assay was performed by incubation with AMPK purified from rat liver (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instruction with some modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of GST fusion proteins on the glutathione-Sepharose solid support were incubated with 10 milliunits of AMPK in a final volume of 25 μl containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 400 μm AMP, 80 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Science). After incubation at 30 °C for 7 min, beads were sedimented by a quick centrifugation and then washed six times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm EDTA. GST fusion proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). AP-1 cells (mutagenized Chinese hamster ovary cells devoid of plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchange activity) (32Rotin D. Grinstein S. Impaired cell volume regulation in Na+-H+ exchange-deficient mutants.Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm NaHCO3 (pH 7.4). AP-1 cells stably expressing NHE1 and NHE5 (AP-1/NHE1 and AP-5/NHE5, respectively) were generated using an acid challenging selection process as previously described (22Szabó E.Z. Numata M. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. Kinetic and pharmacological properties of human brain Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 5 stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.J. Biol.

Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from postnatal day 0–2 mice. Briefly, animals were killed by decapitation, their brains removed, and hippocampi was dissected out. Dissected hippocampi were maintained in chilled 100 μm HEPES-buffered saline solution supplemented with 0.6% glucose, then digested with 165 units of papain for 30 min at 37 °C. Recovered neurons and glial cells were dissociated by trituration and suspended in DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10% FBS, and 0.6% glucose. The suspension was passed through a BD Biosciences Falcon 70-μm cell strainer and placed into a 15-ml conical tube on top of an Opti-Prep density gradient and centrifuged at ∼800 × g as described previously (33Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Isolation and culture of adult neurons and neurospheres.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Fractions enriched in neurons were collected and washed with DMEM suspension media. The cells were then plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 12-mm coverslips at an approximate density of 5000 cells/cm2 and placed in an incubator at 37 °C. After 24 h, plating media was replaced with neuronal growth media consisting of Neurobasal-A, 2% B-27 supplement, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and for only the first feeding, 20 μm arabinofuranosyl cytidine to inhibit glial cell proliferation. Neurons were fed every 3–4 days subsequently without arabinofuranosyl cytidine and maintained +14 days in vitro in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell and tissue lysates were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.25% sodium deoxycholic acid. Depending on the experiment, cell lysates (1 ml) were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize the HA-epitope, AMPKα1, -α2, -γ1, or -γ2 subunits (5 μg each). Brain tissue lysates were incubated with either mouse IgG or mouse monoclonal anti-AMPKα1/2 antibody (5 μg each). All lysates were incubated at 4 °C overnight on a tilt rocker platform, followed by 2 h of IgG binding to 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose beads on a tilt rocker. The beads were washed 4 times for 5 min each in lysis buffer. The proteins in the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. Membranes containing immunoprecipitates were blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk and PBS-T, and then probed with various primary antibodies as follows. NHE5HA3 and AMPKα2myc were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-HA and anti-myc antibodies, respectively. Native AMPKβ was detected with a rabbit pan polyclonal antibody that recognizes both AMPKβ1 and -β2. Native NHE5 was detected with an isoform-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody as described previously (24Lukashova V. Jinadasa T. Ilie A. Verbich D. Cooper E. Orlowski J. The Na+/H+ exchanger NHE5 is sorted to discrete intracellular vesicles in the central and peripheral nervous systems.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2013; 961: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat skim milk, and PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20). The signals were visualized with either 0.8 μg/ml of HRP-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies after a 1-h incubation. Immunoreactive bands were detected with ECL detection reagents (Western Lighting Ultra PerkinElmer kit) and Kodak x-ray film. Cell lysates were prepared in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and the ATP concentrations were determined with the Invitrogen ATP Determination Kit. The luciferase activity was measured with a Turner Designs TD-20/20 luminometer. NHE5ChFP and AMPKα2GFP (1.5 μg each) were simultaneously transfected into AP-1 cells grown in 35-mm culture dishes with 25-mm glass coverslip bottoms (MatTek Corporation) using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) and their intracellular localizations were analyzed 48 h after transfection.

https://openalex.org/W2056547629,"Circadian clocks in the peripheral tissues of mice are known to be entrained by pulse stimuli such as restricted feeding, novel wheel running, and several other agents. However, there are no reports on high temperature pulse-mediated entrainment on the phase-shift of peripheral clocks in vivo. Here we show that temperature treatment of mice for two days at 41°C, instead of 37°C, for 1–2 h during the inactive period, using a temperature controlled water bath stimulated phase-advance of peripheral clocks in the kidney, liver, and submandibular gland of PER2::LUCIFERASE mice. On the other hand, treatment for 2 days at 35°C ambient room temperature for 2 h did not cause a phase-advance. Maintenance of mice at 41°C in a water bath, sustained the core body temperature at 40–41°C. However, the use of 37°C water bath or the 35°C ambient room temperature elevated the core body temperature to 38.5°C, suggesting that at least a core body temperature of 40–41°C is necessary to cause phase-advance under light-dark cycle conditions. The temperature pulse stimulation at 41°C, instead of 37°C water bath for 2 h led to the elevated expression of Per1 and Hsp70 in the peripheral tissue of mice. In summary, the present study demonstrates that transient high temperature pulse using water bath during daytime causes phase-advance in mouse peripheral clocks in vivo. The present results suggest that hot water bath may affect the phase of peripheral clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2053629739,"Rho small GTPases control cell morphology and motility through the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton. We have previously shown that FilGAP, a Rac-specific GAP, binds to the actin-cross-linking protein Filamin A (FLNa) and suppresses Rac-dependent lamellae formation and cell spreading. ARHGAP22 is a member of FilGAP family, and implicated in the regulation of tumor cell motility. However, little is known concerning the cellular localization and mechanism of regulation at the molecular level. Whereas FilGAP binds to FLNa and localizes to lamellae, we found that ARHGAP22 did not bind to FLNa. Forced expression of ARHGAP22 induced enlarged vesicular structures containing the endocytic markers EEA1, Rab5, and Rab11. Moreover, endogenous ARHGAP22 is co-localized with EEA1- and Rab11-positive endosomes but not with trans-Golgi marker TNG46. When constitutively activated Rac Q61L mutant was expressed, ARHGAP22 is co-localized with Rac Q61L at membrane ruffles, suggesting that ARHGAP22 is translocated from endosomes to membrane ruffles to inactivate Rac. Forced expression of ARHGAP22 suppressed lamellae formation and cell spreading. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ARHGAP22 stimulated cell spreading. Thus, our findings suggest that ARHGAP22 controls cell morphology by inactivating Rac but its localization is not mediated by its interaction with FLNa."
https://openalex.org/W1994235645,"Planting of native trees for habitat restoration is a widespread practice, but the consequences for the retention and transmission of genetic diversity in planted and natural populations are unclear. Using Inga vera subsp. affinis as a model species, we genotyped five natural and five planted populations in the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil at polymorphic microsatellite loci. We studied the breeding system and population structure to test how much genetic diversity is retained in planted relative to natural populations. We then genotyped seedlings from these populations to test whether genetic diversity in planted populations is restored by outcrossing to natural populations of I. vera. The breeding system of natural I. vera populations was confirmed to be highly outcrossing (t = 0.92; FIS = −0.061, P = 0.04), with populations showing weak population substructure (FST = 0.028). Genetic diversity in planted populations was 50% less than that of natural populations (planted: AR = 14.9, HO = 0.865 and natural: AR = 30.8, HO = 0.655). However, seedlings from planted populations showed a 30% higher allelic richness relative to their parents (seedlings AR = 10.5, parents AR = 7.6). Understanding the processes and interactions that shape this system are necessary to provide ecologically sensible goals and successfully restore hyper-fragmented habitats. Future restoration plans for I. vera must consider the genetic diversity of planted populations and the potential for gene flow between natural populations in the landscape, in order to preserve ecological interactions (i.e. pollination), and promote opportunities for outcrossing."
https://openalex.org/W2010667599,"NOD2, one of the cytosolic proteins that contain a nuclear oligomerization domain (NOD), is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) involved in innate immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Little is known, however, about the effect of NOD2 expression on the maternal–fetal relationship. Our aim was to elucidate the functions of NOD2 in normal decidual stromal cells (DSCs) from the first trimester. Tissues and DSCs were isolated from 26 patients with normal pregnancies that required abortion. The expression of NOD2 in deciduas/decidual stromal cells (DSCs) was examined by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and In-cell western. DSCs containing NOD2 were stimulated by its ligand, muramyl dipeptide (MDP). The secretion of various cytokines and chemokines were measured by ELISA and the apoptotic rate was determined by flow cytometry. Treatment with MDP significantly elevated the expression of both NOD2 mRNA and protein levels in DSCs. In addition, MDP activation of NOD2 significantly increased IL-1β and MCP-1 cytokine expression in a dose dependent manner but had no effect on IL-12 expression. IL-1β and TNF-α also significantly increased the expression of NOD2 in DSCs, suggesting a positive feedback loop mechanism. Moreover, MDP stimulation augmented DSC apoptosis. In summary, the results suggest that NOD2 expression in DSCs plays an important role in protecting the embryo and preventing infection in the maternal-fetal interface."
https://openalex.org/W2038621077,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway conveys signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to regulate cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, and motility. Previously we found that prolylcarboxypeptidase (PRCP) regulate proliferation and survival in breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that PRCP and the related family member prolylendopeptidase (PREP) are essential for proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. Depletion/inhibition of PRCP and PREP-induced serine phosphorylation and degradation of IRS-1, leading to inactivation of the cellular PI3K and AKT. Notably, depletion/inhibition of PRCP/PREP destabilized IRS-1 in the cells treated with rapamycin, blocking the feedback activation PI3K/AKT. Consequently, inhibition of PRCP/PREP enhanced rapamycin-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, we have identified PRCP and PREP as a stabilizer of IRS-1 which is critical for PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092237124,"Halogen bonding in ligand-protein complexes is currently widely exploited, e.g. in drug design or supramolecular chemistry. But little attention has been directed to other effects that may result from replacement of a hydrogen by a strongly electronegative halogen. Analysis of almost 30000 hydrogen bonds between protein and ligand demonstrates that the length of a hydrogen bond depends on the type of donor-acceptor pair. Interestingly, lengths of hydrogen bonds between a protein and a halogenated ligand are visibly shorter than those estimated for the same family of proteins in complexes with non-halogenated ligands. Taking into account the effect of halogenation on hydrogen bonding is thus important when evaluating structural and/or energetic parameters of ligand-protein complexes. All these observations are consistent with the concept that halogenation increases the acidity of the proximal amino/imino/hydroxyl groups and thus makes them better, i.e. stronger, H-bond donors."
https://openalex.org/W2335594962,"This work is a part of the Taiwan Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation, the first large scale hydrographic and plankton survey around Taiwan (21–26°N, 119–123°E). The present study examined the influence of hydrodynamic and biological variables driven by monsoon system on the siphonophore assemblages through an annual cycle in 2004. Calycophorans, namely Chelophyes appendiculata, Diphyes chamissonis, Lensia subtiloides, Bassia bassensis, and Muggiaea atlantica, were the most dominant siphonophore species. Maximum abundance of these dominant species generally occurred during the warm period (May and August), while M. atlantica had a significantly peak abundance in February. Although no apparently temporal difference in siphonophore abundance was observed in the study, siphonophore assemblage was more diverse in August than in other sampling times. Result of a cluster analysis indicated that assemblage structure of siphonophores in the waters around Taiwan varied at temporal and spatial scales during the sampling period. The intrusions of the Kuroshio Branch Current and China Coastal Current to the study area play an important role on the transportation of siphonophores. Also, the distribution of siphonophore assemblage was closely related to the hydrographic characteristics, with temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and zooplankton abundance being the major environmental factors affecting the spatio-temporal variability of siphonophores. This study contributes substantially to the new knowledge of the siphonophore assemblage in the tropical-temperate waters of Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W1973318895,"In this study, a new family of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) copolymers that bear oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) moieties is described. The synthesis of three different oligo(ethylene glycol) functionalized epoxide monomers derived from 2-methyl-4-pentenoic acid, and their copolymerization with ε-caprolactone (CL) to poly(CL-co-OEG-MPO) copolymers is presented. The statistical copolymerization initiated with SnOct2/BnOH yielded the copolymers with varying OEG content and composition. The linear relationship between feed ratio and incorporation of the OEG co-monomer enables control over backbone functional group density. The introduction of OEG moieties influenced both the thermal and the hydrophilic characteristics of the copolymers. Both increasing OEG length and backbone content resulted in a decrease in static water contact angle. The introduction of OEG side chains in the PCL copolymers had no adverse influence on MC-3TE3-E1 cell interaction. However, changes to cell form factor (Φ) were observed. While unmodified PCL promoted elongated (anisotropic) morphologies (Φ = 0.094), PCL copolymer with tri-ethylene glycol side chains at or above seven percent backbone incorporation induced more isotropic cell morphologies (Φ = 0.184) similar to those observed on glass controls (Φ = 0.151)."
https://openalex.org/W1977320351,"This article discusses the dynamics of a diameter distribution in stands of black wattle throughout its growth cycle using the Weibull probability density function. Moreover, the parameters of this distribution were related to environmental variables from meteorological data and surface soil horizon with the aim of finding a model for diameter distribution which their coefficients were related to the environmental variables. We found that the diameter distribution of the stand changes only slightly over time and that the estimators of the Weibull function are correlated with various environmental variables, with accumulated rainfall foremost among them. Thus, a model was obtained in which the estimators of the Weibull function are dependent on rainfall. Such a function can have important applications, such as in simulating growth potential in regions where historical growth data is lacking, as well as the behavior of the stand under different environmental conditions. The model can also be used to project growth in diameter, based on the rainfall affecting the forest over a certain time period."
https://openalex.org/W2027139799,"MK2 and MK3 are downstream targets of p38 and ERK1/2. They control the mRNA stability of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-10. Whereas MK2 is expressed ubiquitously, the expression of MK3 is restricted to muscle, liver, and heart tissues and T and NK cells. Using Mk-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice, we demonstrated an inhibitory effect of MK3, but not of MK2, on interferon (IFN)-γ expression in T and NK lymphocytes. The results provided evidence that the inhibitory effect of MK3 is based on negative feedback phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2, which causes decreased binding of Stat4 to the IFN-γ promoter and reduced expression of IFN-γ mRNA and protein. Consequently, all Mk3(-/-) mice challenged with the Th1-inducing influenza A virus (IAV) survived the WT LD50 virus dose. The reduced disease severity in the Mk3(-/-) mice was accompanied by a >10-fold reduction in viral lung titer and an increase in the number of activated NK cells and enhanced Th1 activation of CD4 T cells. Thus, our data describe the protein kinase MK3 as a novel regulator of the innate and adaptive immune responses.-Köther, K., Nordhoff, C., Masemann, D., Varga, G., Bream, J.

https://openalex.org/W1966513342,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and PDI-like proteins are members of the thioredoxin superfamily. They contain thioredoxin-like domains and catalyze the physiological oxidation, reduction and isomerization of protein disulfide bonds, which are involved in cell function and development in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In this study, EtPDIL, a novel PDI-like gene of Eimeria tenella, was cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) according to the expressed sequence tag (EST). The EtPDIL cDNA contained 1129 nucleotides encoding 216 amino acids. The deduced EtPDIL protein belonged to thioredoxin-like superfamily and had a single predicted thioredoxin domain with a non-classical thioredoxin-like motif (SXXC). BLAST analysis showed that the EtPDIL protein was 55–59% identical to PDI-like proteins of other apicomplexan parasites. The transcript and protein levels of EtPDIL at different development stages were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot. The messenger RNA and protein levels of EtPDIL were higher in sporulated oocysts than in unsporulated oocysts, sporozoites or merozoites. Protein expression was barely detectable in unsporulated oocysts. Western blots showed that rabbit antiserum against recombinant EtPDIL recognized only a native 24 kDa protein from parasites. Immunolocalization with EtPDIL antibody showed that EtPDIL had a disperse distribution in the cytoplasm of whole sporozoites and merozoites. After sporozoites were incubated in complete medium, EtPDIL protein concentrated at the anterior of the sporozoites and appeared on the surface of parasites. Specific staining was more intense and mainly located on the parasite surface after merozoites released from mature schizonts invaded DF-1 cells. After development of parasites in DF-1 cells, staining intensified in trophozoites, immature schizonts and mature schizonts. Antibody inhibition of EtPDIL function reduced the ability of E. tenella to invade DF-1 cells. These results suggested that EtPDIL might be involved in sporulation in external environments and in host cell adhesion, invasion and development of E. tenella."
https://openalex.org/W2048987119,"Dupuytren’s disease (DD) is a common progressive fibroproliferative disorder causing permanent digital contracture. Proliferative myofibroblasts are thought to be the cells responsible for DD initiation and recurrence, although their source remains unknown. DD tissue has also been shown to harbor mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells. Fibrocytes are circulating cells that show characteristics of fibroblasts and they express surface markers for both hematopoietic and mesenchymal stromal cells. Fibrocytes differentiate from peripheral CD14+ mononuclear cells, which can be inhibited by serum amyloid P (SAP). In this study we have demonstrated the presence of fibrocytes in DD blood and tissue, moreover we have evaluated the effects of SAP and Xiapex (Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum) on fibrocytes derived from DD. H&E staining showed typical Spindle shaped morphology of fibrocytes. FACS analysis based on a unique combination of 3 markers, revealed the increased presence of fibrocytes in blood and tissue of DD patients. Additionally, immunohistology of DD nodule and cord tissue showed the presence of collagen 1+/CD34+ cells. No difference in plasma SAP levels was observed between DD and control. Higher concentrations of SAP significantly inhibited fibrocytes differentiated from DD derived monocytes compared to control. DD fascia derived fibrocytes showed resistance to growth inhibition by SAP, particularly nodule derived fibrocytes showed robust growth even at higher SAP concentrations compared to control. DD derived fibrocytes were positive for typical fibrocyte dual markers, i.e. Collagen 1/LSP-1 and collagen 1/CD34. Xiapex was more effective in inhibiting the growth of nodule derived cells compared to commercially available collagenase A. Our results show for the first time the increased presence of fibrocytes in DD patient’s blood and disease tissue compared to control tissue. Additionally, we evaluate the response of these fibrocytes to SAP and Xiapex therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2040673105,"The development of sandification process was studied, by monitoring the changes of sediment characteristics, at marsh-sandy land intersections in China's Songnen region. A series of sediment collection plates were deployed in the region; after one year, sediments in these plates were analyzed for changes of mass and chemical characteristics. The sediment flux and the sand content of the sediments decreased with the increasing longitudinal distance between the sampling site and the centre line of a sand dune. The mean sediment flux was 29 ± 14 kg m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.6 ± 0.3 kg m(-2) yr(-1) in the sandy land and marsh, respectively. Strong, positive correlations were found between the concentrations of organic matter, total nitrogen, P, Fe, Ti, V and Zr, all of which were also negatively correlated with the sand content. The concentrations of organic matter, total nitrogen, P, Fe, Ti, V and Zr in the marsh sediment samples were all significantly greater than the corresponding concentrations of the sandy land (p<0.001). Sand content and Ti, V and Zr concentrations all proved to be valid indicators of sandification intensity, and they showed that the marsh could be divided into three distinct zones. Sand expansion extended about 88 m into the marsh. The mean sand content in the sediments of the sandy land was 91% and then 64% in the marsh, which in turn was higher than that of marshes outside the influence of sandification, suggesting that the marsh in the marsh-sandy land transitional area has already undergone extensive sandification in the past. The study results provide information on the wetland's function of indicating and buffering the sandification process."
https://openalex.org/W1983748078,"The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method is a classical and commonly utilized technique for dimensionality reduction and classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Being a first-order discriminator, LDA is usually preceded by the feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as multi-density EEG data are of second order. In this study, an analytic bilinear classification method which inherits and extends LDA is proposed. This method considers 2-dimentional EEG signals as the feature input and performs classification using the optimized complex-valued bilinear projections. Without being transformed into frequency domain, the complex-valued bilinear projections essentially spatially and temporally modulate the phases and magnitudes of slow event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by distinct brain states in the sense that they become more separable. The results show that the proposed method has demonstrated its discriminating capability in the development of a rapid image triage (RIT) system, which is a challenging variant of BCIs due to the fast presentation speed and consequently overlapping of ERPs."
https://openalex.org/W2038968990,"At present, carcinogenic models imply that all individuals in a population are susceptible to cancer. These models either ignore a fall of the cancer incidence rate at old ages, or use some poorly identifiable parameters for its accounting. In this work, a new heuristic model is proposed. The model assumes that, in a population, only a small fraction (pool) of individuals is susceptible to cancer and decomposes the problem of the carcinogenic modeling on two sequentially solvable problems: (i) determination of the age-specific hazard rate in individuals susceptible to cancer (individual hazard rate) from the observed hazard rate in the population (population hazard rate); and (ii) modelling of the individual hazard rate by a chosen “up” of the theoretical hazard function describing cancer occurrence in individuals in time (age). The model considers carcinogenesis as a failure of individuals susceptible to cancer to resist cancer occurrence in aging and uses, as the theoretical hazard function, the three-parameter Weibull hazard function, often utilized in a failure analysis. The parameters of this function, providing the best fit of the modeled and observed individual hazard rates (determined from the population hazard rates), are the outcomes of the modeling. The model was applied to the pancreatic cancer data. It was shown that, in the populations stratified by gender, race and the geographic area of living, the modeled and observed population hazard rates of pancreatic cancer occurrence have similar turnovers at old ages. The sizes of the pools of individuals susceptible to this cancer: (i) depend on gender, race and the geographic area of living; (ii) proportionally influence the corresponding population hazard rates; and (iii) do not influence the individual hazard rates. The model should be further tested using data on other types of cancer and for the populations stratified by different categorical variables."
https://openalex.org/W2042366508,"Sequential Pattern Mining is a widely addressed problem in data mining, with applications such as analyzing Web usage, examining purchase behavior, and text mining, among others. Nevertheless, with the dramatic increase in data volume, the current approaches prove inefficient when dealing with large input datasets, a large number of different symbols and low minimum supports. In this paper, we propose a new sequential pattern mining algorithm, which follows a pattern-growth scheme to discover sequential patterns. Unlike most pattern growth algorithms, our approach does not build a data structure to represent the input dataset, but instead accesses the required sequences through pseudo-projection databases, achieving better runtime and reducing memory requirements. Our algorithm traverses the search space in a depth-first fashion and only preserves in memory a pattern node linkage and the pseudo-projections required for the branch being explored at the time. Experimental results show that our new approach, the Node Linkage Depth-First Traversal algorithm (NLDFT), has better performance and scalability in comparison with state of the art algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2041957998,"The purpose of this study was to generate quadruple fluorescent protein (QFP) transgenic mice as a source for QFP-expressing neural stem and progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs) that could be utilized as a tool for transplantation research. When undifferentiated, these NSCs only express cyan fluorescent protein (CFP); however, upon neuronal differentiation, the cells express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). During astrocytic differentiation, the cells express green fluorescent protein (GFP), and during oligodendrocytic differentiation, the cells express red fluorescent protein (DsRed). Using immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry and electrophysiology, quadruple transgenic NPCs (Q-NPCs) and GFP-sorted NPCs were comprehensively characterized in vitro. Overall, the various transgenes did not significantly affect proliferation and differentiation of transgenic NPCs in comparison to wild-type NPCs. In contrast to a strong CFP and GFP expression in vitro, NPCs did not express YFP and dsRed either during proliferation or after differentiation in vitro. GFP-positive sorted NPCs, expressing GFP under the control of the human GFAP promoter, demonstrated a significant improvement in astroglial differentiation in comparison to GFP-negative sorted NPCs. In contrast to non-sorted and GFP-positive sorted NPCs, GFP-negative sorted NPCs demonstrated a high proportion of neuronal differentiation and proved to be functional in vitro. At 6 weeks after the intracerebroventricular transplantation of Q-NPCs into neonatal wild-type mice, CFP/DCX (doublecortin) double-positive transplanted cells were observed. The Q-NPCs did not express any other fluorescent proteins and did not mature into neuronal or glial cells. Although this model failed to visualize NPC differentiation in vivo, we determined that activation of the NPC glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) promoter, as indicated by GFP expression, can be used to separate neuronal and glial progenitors as a valuable tool for transplantation studies."
