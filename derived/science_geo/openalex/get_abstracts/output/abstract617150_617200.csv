https://openalex.org/W2886253007,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) messenger RNA methylation is a gene regulatory mechanism affecting cell differentiation and proliferation in development and cancer. To study the roles of m6A mRNA methylation in cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, we investigated human endometrial cancer in which a hotspot R298P mutation is present in a key component of the methyltransferase complex (METTL14). We found that about 70% of endometrial tumours exhibit reductions in m6A methylation that are probably due to either this METTL14 mutation or reduced expression of METTL3, another component of the methyltransferase complex. These changes lead to increased proliferation and tumorigenicity of endometrial cancer cells, likely through activation of the AKT pathway. Reductions in m6A methylation lead to decreased expression of the negative AKT regulator PHLPP2 and increased expression of the positive AKT regulator mTORC2. Together, these results reveal reduced m6A mRNA methylation as an oncogenic mechanism in endometrial cancer and identify m6A methylation as a regulator of AKT signalling."

However, intact tissue samples naturally exhibit variation in cellular composition, which drives covariation of cell-class-specific molecular features. By analyzing transcriptional covariation in 7,221 intact CNS samples from 840 neurotypical individuals, representing billions of cells, we reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans. By modeling intact CNS transcriptomes as a function of variation in cellular composition, we identify cell-class-specific transcriptional differences in Alzheimer's disease, among brain regions, and between species. Among these, we show that PMP2 is expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes and significantly increases mouse astrocyte size upon ectopic expression in vivo, causing them to more closely resemble their human counterparts. Our work is available as an online resource ( http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu/ ) and provides a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2888320733,"Lack of insight into mechanisms governing breast cancer metastasis has precluded the development of curative therapies. Metastasis-initiating cancer cells (MICs) are uniquely equipped to establish metastases, causing recurrence and therapeutic resistance. Using various metastasis models, we discovered that certain primary tumours elicit a systemic inflammatory response involving interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-expressing innate immune cells that infiltrate distant MIC microenvironments. At the metastatic site, IL-1β maintains MICs in a ZEB1-positive differentiation state, preventing MICs from generating highly proliferative E-cadherin-positive progeny. Thus, when the inherent plasticity of MICs is impeded, overt metastases cannot be established. Ablation of the pro-inflammatory response or inhibition of the IL-1 receptor relieves the differentiation block and results in metastatic colonization. Among patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer, high primary tumour IL-1β expression is associated with better overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival. Our data reveal complex interactions that occur between primary tumours and disseminated MICs that could be exploited to improve patient survival."
https://openalex.org/W2888070055,"The target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of plasma membrane (PM) tension. TORC2 activation following increased PM tension involves redistribution of the Slm1 and 2 paralogues from PM invaginations known as eisosomes into membrane compartments containing TORC2. How Slm1/2 relocalization is triggered, and if/how this plays a role in TORC2 inactivation with decreased PM tension, is unknown. Using osmotic shocks and palmitoylcarnitine as orthogonal tools to manipulate PM tension, we demonstrate that decreased PM tension triggers spontaneous, energy-independent reorganization of pre-existing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into discrete invaginated membrane domains, which cluster and inactivate TORC2. These results demonstrate that increased and decreased membrane tension are sensed through different mechanisms, highlighting a role for membrane lipid phase separation in mechanotransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2889407480,"Diseases of accelerated aging often occur together (multimorbidity), and their prevalence is increasing, with high societal and health care costs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one such condition, in which one half of patients exhibit ≥4 age-related diseases. Diseases of accelerated aging share common molecular pathways, which lead to the detrimental accumulation of senescent cells. These senescent cells no longer divide but release multiple inflammatory proteins, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which may perpetuate and speed disease. Here, we show that inhibiting miR-570-3p, which is increased in COPD cells, reverses cellular senescence by restoring the antiaging molecule sirtuin-1. MiR-570-3p is induced by oxidative stress in airway epithelial cells through p38 MAP kinase-c-Jun signaling and drives senescence by inhibiting sirtuin-1. Inhibition of elevated miR-570-3p in COPD small airway epithelial cells, using an antagomir, restores sirtuin-1 and suppresses markers of cellular senescence (p16INK4a, p21Waf1, and p27Kip1), thereby restoring cellular growth by allowing progression through the cell cycle. MiR-570-3p inhibition also suppresses the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (matrix metalloproteinases-2/9, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8, IL-1β, and IL-6). Collectively, these data suggest that inhibiting miR-570-3p rejuvenates cells via restoration of sirtuin-1, reducing many of the abnormalities associated with cellular senescence.-Baker, J.

https://openalex.org/W2889058190,"Achieving access to safe water and sanitation still pose major challenges in urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa countries, despite all the progress achieved in the last decade. This study assessed the ability of populations living in poor peri-urban settlements to access improved water and sanitation and identified factors influencing this access, in order to guide sustainable mitigating solutions to address associated health and environmental risks. We conducted a cross-sectional study in six poor peri-urban settlements of Yopougon, the largest municipality of Abidjan. A total of 556 randomly selected households were included. The factors associated with access to improved water and sanitation were identified through explanatory models using multivariate logistic regression. A proportion of 25% of all households assessed did not have access to clean water and 57% lacked improved sanitation. Socioeconomic status and settlement characteristics appear as the main indicators of poor access to reliable water and sanitation in peri-urban settlements. The presence of the household head's wife at home was associated with greater access to clean water (OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 1.74, 7.31), thus highlighting the important role of women in ensuring access to clean water in these specific environments. Household size, education and religion were not significantly associated with the two considered outcomes. Women therefore should be involved at all levels of programming in water promotion in these settlements to improve the population's well-being. While religion does not appear to play an important role in access to water and sanitation, successful interventions should involve religious communities because of their large representation."

The MCU is a Ca2+-conducting channel spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, deletion of the MCU completely inhibited Ca2+ uptake in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle mitochondria. However, in brain nonsynaptic and synaptic mitochondria from neuronal somata/glial cells and nerve terminals, respectively, the MCU deletion slowed, but did not completely block, Ca2+ uptake. Under resting conditions, brain MCU-KO mitochondria remained polarized, and in brain MCU-KO mitochondria, the electrophoretic Ca2+ ionophore ETH129 significantly accelerated Ca2+ uptake. The residual Ca2+ uptake in brain MCU-KO mitochondria was insensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and ryanodine receptor (CGP37157 and dantrolene, respectively), but was blocked by the MCU inhibitor Ru360. Respiration of WT and MCU-KO brain mitochondria was similar except that for mitochondria that oxidized pyruvate and malate, Ca2+ more strongly inhibited respiration in WT than in MCU-KO mitochondria. Of note, the MCU deletion significantly attenuated but did not completely prevent induction of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in brain mitochondria. Expression level of cyclophilin D and ATP content in mitochondria, two factors that modulate PTP induction, were unaffected by MCU-KO, whereas ADP was lower in MCU-KO than in WT brain mitochondria.

Correspondingly, knockdown of MCU reduced NMDA-induced increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ in neurons, leading to milder mitochondrial depolarization and elevated resistance to excitotoxicity (29Qiu J.

On the other hand, MCU KO failed to protect brain from hypoxic-ischemic damage, despite strongly hindering mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and PTP induction (30Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G.

One reason for this controversy could be an incomplete inhibition of Ca2+ uptake in brain mitochondria from MCU-KO mice. However, brain mitochondria from MCU-KO mice are poorly characterized in terms of Ca2+ uptake, membrane potential changes, respiratory activities, and susceptibility to PTP induction. In the present study, we investigated the effect of MCU KO on Ca2+ uptake and membrane potential in isolated brain nonsynaptic and synaptic mitochondria as well as in liver, heart, and skeletal muscle mitochondria. We also compared respiratory activities of brain mitochondria isolated from WT and MCU-KO mice. Finally, we evaluated susceptibility of MCU-KO and WT mitochondria to PTP induction. Our results demonstrate that there is a unique MCU-independent, Ru360-sensitive Ca2+ uptake in brain mitochondria that results in PTP induction in a fraction of vulnerable organelles. Thus, these findings evince a potential mechanism by which deletion of MCU might be not very efficacious in protecting brain mitochondria from PTP induction and, consequently, in protecting the brain from ischemia–reperfusion insults. All MCU-KO mice used in our experiments were genotyped (Fig. 1A) and all mitochondrial preparations were tested for MCU by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). The level of MCU expression in brain nonsynaptic mitochondria of MCU-KO mice was below the detection limit of Western blotting. Expression of MCU paralog, MCUb (18Sancak Y. Markhard A.L. Kitami T.

In our study, we used a high-resolution Ca2+-sensitive electrode that enabled us to evaluate, with high precision, changes in the rate of Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria from MCU-KO and WT mice. To assess the rate and capacity of Ca2+ uptake, multiple pulses of CaCl2 were applied to mitochondria (Fig. 1, D and E). Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was monitored by measuring a decrease in external Ca2+. Brain nonsynaptic mitochondria isolated from WT mice accumulated Ca2+ faster than mitochondria from MCU-KO animals (Fig. 1D). Despite this, Ca2+ uptake capacity, determined as the amount of Ca2+ accumulated by mitochondria before they failed to accumulate additional Ca2+, was not significantly different. BSA significantly increased the Ca2+ uptake capacity (Fig. 1E). The Ca2+ uptake capacity is limited by an induction of the PTP (30Chalmers S. Nicholls D.G.

Mitochondrial permeability transition: a look from a different angle.in: Gribkoff V.K. Jonas E.A. Hardwick J.M. The Functions, Disease-related Dysfunctions, and Therapeutic Targeting of Neuronal Mitochondria. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2016: 3-30Google Scholar). In the presence of BSA, the Ca2+ uptake capacities of MCU-KO and WT mitochondria remain similar (Fig. 1E). In parallel experiments, we tested the effect of Ca2+ pulses on mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1, F and G). The decreased rate of Ca2+ uptake by MCU-KO mitochondria (Fig. 1, D and E) could result from these mitochondria being less polarized. However, under resting conditions, mitochondria from MCU-KO and WT mice accumulated comparable amounts of TPP+, suggesting similar polarization of both MCU-KO and WT mitochondria. The repetitive Ca2+ pulses produced fast, transient depolarizations in WT mitochondria (Fig. 1F), whereas in MCU-KO mitochondria, Ca2+ pulses produced slower depolarizations with much smaller amplitude (Fig. 1G). At the end of these experiments, mitochondria were treated with the uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) to produce maximal depolarization. In contrast to brain nonsynaptic mitochondria, mitochondria isolated from liver, heart, and skeletal muscles of MCU-KO mice were not able to take Ca2+ up and depolarize in response to Ca2+ (Fig. 2). The MCU expression in heart mitochondria was the lowest compared with other tissues (Fig. 2J). The level of MCU in mitochondria from MCU-KO mice was below the detection limit of Western blotting. The level of MCUb varied among mitochondria from different tissues, with skeletal muscle mitochondria having the least amount of MCUb and heart mitochondria having the greatest amount of MCUb (Fig. 2K). Expression of MCUb was distinctly lower in skeletal muscle mitochondria from MCU-KO mice compared with MCUb level in skeletal muscle mitochondria from WT animals. ETH129, an electrophoretic Ca2+ ionophore (34Prestipino G. Falugi C. Falchetto R. Gazzotti P. The ionophore ETH 129 as Ca2+ translocator in artificial and natural membranes.Anal.

Bradshaw P.C. Litsky M. Pfeiffer D.R. Ca2+ transport in mitochondria from yeast expressing recombinant aequorin.Anal.

Inhibition of mitochondrial calcium ion transport by an oxo-bridged dinuclear ruthenium ammine complex.Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (2036363): 4949-495210.1021/bi00234a016Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), strongly inhibited Ca2+ uptake (Fig. 3B). When the Ca2+ uniporter was blocked by Ru360, ETH129 restored Ca2+ uptake by brain nonsynaptic mitochondria. Similarly, ETH129 significantly increased Ca2+ uptake rate in brain nonsynaptic mitochondria from MCU-KO mice (Fig. 3C). This is consistent with unaffected polarization of MCU-KO mitochondria and supports the notion that deletion of MCU was the main cause of inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. On the other hand, Ru360 strongly inhibited Ca2+ uptake by MCU-KO mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows statistical analysis of the data. Fig. 3A shows a calibration of the Ca2+-selective electrode with consecutive 100 μm CaCl2 pulses. The intriguing finding that despite MCU deletion, MCU-KO brain nonsynaptic mitochondria were able to accumulate Ca2+ (Fig. 1, D and E), suggested that either MCU is not a Ca2+ channel essential for Ca2+ uptake and serves a regulatory role or there are alternative pathways for Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. Because reconstituted MCU was able to generate Ca2+ currents in experiments with planar lipid bilayer (11De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Teardo E. Szabò I. Rizzuto R.

The alternative pathways for Ca2+ uptake by MCU-KO brain mitochondria could include mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, operating in reverse (37Griffiths E.J.

Here again, Ru360, strongly inhibited Ca2+ uptake by WT and MCU-KO mitochondria (Fig. 4, B and C). Fig. 4A shows calibration of the Ca2+-selective electrode with consecutive 20 μm CaCl2 pulses, whereas Fig. 3F shows statistical analysis of these Ca2+ uptake experiments. The difference in the rates of Ca2+ uptake shown in Figure 3., Figure 4. is most likely due to the difference in the concentration of added Ca2+. In Fig. 3, Ca2+ uptake was induced by adding 100 μm Ca2+, whereas in Fig. 4, 20 μm Ca2+ was added. In the mitochondrial matrix, Ca2+ activates pyruvate dehydrogenase as well as the Krebs cycle enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (4Denton R.M. Regulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by calcium ions.Biochim. Biophys.

To test this possibility, we performed respirometry experiments using a Clark electrode and isolated brain nonsynaptic mitochondria fueled either with pyruvate plus malate (Complex I substrates) (Fig. 5, A and B) or with succinate (a Complex II substrate) (Fig. 5, C and D). In the latter case, the incubation medium was supplemented with 3 mm glutamate to remove oxaloacetate in transaminase reaction to prevent oxaloacetate accumulation and inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (42Wojtczak A.B.

We analyzed basal respiration (V2), governed predominantly by proton permeability of the IMM; ADP-stimulated respiration (V3), determined primarily by activity of the oxidative phosphorylation system; the controlled respiration (V4), determined by proton permeability of the IMM and possible contaminations with ATPase activities; and uncoupled respiration (VDNP), governed by activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In our experiments, we did not find a significant difference in respiration of mitochondria from MCU-KO and WT mice under any tested conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2889243662,"Despite the good performance of silicate bioactive glasses in bone regeneration, there is considerable potential to enhance their properties by chemical modifications. In this study, S53P4-based borosilicate glasses were synthesized and their dissolution profile was studied in simulated body fluid by assessing pH change, ion release and conversion to hydroxyapatite. The viability, proliferation, attachment, osteogenesis and endothelial marker expression of human adipose stem cells (hASCs) was evaluated upon direct culture on glass discs and in the extract medium. This is the first study evaluating cell behavior in response to borosilicate glasses based on S53P4 (commercially available as BonAlive®). Replacing silicate with borate in S53P4 increased the glass reactivity. Despite the good viability of hASCs under all conditions, direct culture of cells on borosilicate discs and in undiluted extract medium reduced cell proliferation. This was accompanied with changes in cell morphology. Regarding osteogenic commitment, alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly reduced by the borosilicate glass discs and extracts, whereas the expression of osteogenic markers RUNX2a, OSTERIX, DLX5 and OSTEOPONTIN was upregulated. There was also a borosilicate glass-induced increase in osteocalcin protein production. Moreover, osteogenic supplements containing borosilicate extracts significantly increased the mineral production in comparison to the osteogenic medium control. Interestingly, borosilicate glasses stimulated the expression of endothelial markers vWF and PECAM-1. To conclude, our results reveal that despite reducing hASC proliferation, S53P4-based borosilicate glasses and their dissolution products stimulate osteogenic commitment and upregulate endothelial markers, thus supporting their further evaluation for regenerative medicine."

Many circRNAs have been proved to play important roles in the pathogenesis of some diseases. However, the occurrence of circRNAs in OS remains little known. Methods The circular RNA (circRNA) expression file GSE96964 dataset, which included seven osteosarcoma cell lines and one control sample (osteoblast cell line), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to explore the potential function of circRNAs in osteosarcoma by competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis. Three gene expression profiles of OS were downloaded from GEO database and then used for the pathway enrichment analysis, Venn analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Real-time qPCR validation and RNA interference were conducted to verify our prediction. Results Differentially expressed circRNAs between OS and control, including 8 up-regulated and 102 down-regulated circRNAs, were generated and ceRNA analysis for 5 most up-regulated or 5 most down-regulated circRNAs in OS were then performed. The pathway enrichment analysis of gene expression profiles indicated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of three gene profiles significantly enriched in cell cycle pathway, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, p53 signaling pathway and proteoglycans in cancer pathway, which were critical important pathways in the pathogenesis of OS. The Venn analysis showed that 2 (one is a pseudogene) up-regulated and 39 down-regulated DEGs were co-expressed in all three gene profiles. Then PPI networks of 41 co-expressed DEGs (up- and down-regulated DEGs) were constructed to predict their functions using the GeneMANIA. The expression levels of these related RNAs also matched our predictions really well. Conclusion Ultimately, we found cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) gene was not only a co-expression mRNA of the three mRNA expression profiles of OS, but also are predicted to be regulated by hsa_circ_0032462, hsa_circ_0028173, hsa_circ_0005909 by functioning as miRNAs ‘Sponge’ in human osteosarcoma. These over-expressed circRNAs may result in the over expression of CADM1 which promote the development of OS. We envision this discovery of these important moleculars, incuding hsa_circ_0032462, hsa_circ_0028173, hsa_circ_0005909 and CADM1 may lead to further development of new concepts, thus allowing for more opportunities in diagnosis and therapy of OS."

Nickel (Ni) is a ubiquitous heavy metal implied in several health conditions. Regarding this, the European Food Safety Authority has recently released an alert on the possible deleterious effects of dietary Ni on human health given the current levels of Ni dietary intake in some countries. Pre-clinical studies have also suggested its role as an endocrine disruptor and have linked its exposure to energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis dysregulation. Ni allergy is common in the general population, but preliminary data suggest it being even more widespread among overweight patients. Objectives The aim of this study has been to evaluate the presence of Ni allergy and its association with the metabolic and endocrine profile in overweight and obese individuals. Methods We have evaluated 1128 consecutive overweight and obese outpatients. 784 were suspected of being allergic to Ni and 666 were assessed for it. Presence of Ni allergy and correlation with body mass index (BMI), body composition, metabolic parameters and hormonal levels were evaluated. Results We report that Ni allergy is more frequent in presence of weight excess and is associated with worse metabolic parameters and impaired Growth Hormone secretion. Conclusions We confirm that Ni allergy is more common in obese patients, and we report for the first time its association with worse metabolic parameters and impaired function of the GH-IGF1 axis in human subjects."

With AMH, LH/FSH, T and INS as independent variables, a logistic regression model was established, and the ROC curve for combined detection was fitted with the probability value of the model.The serum level of FSH, LH, LH/FSH, AMH, FAI%, 17α-OHP, fasting INS, T, SHBG, DHEA-S and HOMA-IR were altered in the PCOS patients. The best compromise between sensitivity and specificity was found at an AMH cut-off level of 8.16 ng/ml and 5.89 ng/ml for the age groups 20-29 and 30-39 years, with the corresponding area under the curve being 0.846 and 0.865 respectively. The area under the ROC curve for combined detection was 0.951, which was significantly greater than that of each index. Finally, the concentration of AMH was associated with FSH, LH, LH/FSH, T, and ovarian volume in PCOS patients.The optimal AMH diagnostic threshold for PCOS was 8.16 ng/ml (20-29 years) and 5.89 ng/ml (30-39 years) in the Chinese population of this study. Moreover, serum AMH, LH/FSH, T and INS could be used in combination to improve the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for the detection of PCOS."

However, even in responsive cases, its beneficial effect is undermined by the emergence of drug resistance. Here, we tested whether inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and -2 (PARP) enhanced the effectiveness of TMZ. Methods Using patient derived brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) and orthotopic xenografts as models of newly diagnosed and recurrent high-grade glioma, we assessed the effects of TMZ, ABT-888, and the combination of TMZ and ABT-888 on the viability of BTICs and survival of tumor-bearing mice. We also studied DNA damage repair, checkpoint protein phosphorylation, and DNA replication in mismatch repair (MMR) deficient cells treated with TMZ and TMZ plus ABT-888. Results Cells and xenografts derived from newly diagnosed MGMT methylated high-grade gliomas were sensitive to TMZ while those derived from unmethylated and recurrent gliomas were typically resistant. ABT-888 had no effect on the viability of BTICs or tumor bearing mice, but co-treatment with TMZ restored sensitivity in resistant cells and xenografts from newly diagnosed unmethylated gliomas and recurrent gliomas with MSH6 mutations. In contrast, the addition of ABT-888 to TMZ had little sensitizing effect on cells and xenografts derived from newly diagnosed methylated gliomas. In a model of acquired TMZ resistance mediated by loss of MMR gene MSH6, re-sensitization to TMZ by ABT-888 was accompanied by persistent DNA strand breaks, re-engagement of checkpoint kinase signaling, and interruption of DNA synthesis. Conclusion In laboratory models, the addition of ABT-888 to TMZ overcame resistance to TMZ."

However, the triggering mechanisms and regulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors in the commitment of metastasis have not been well characterized. Spermatogenic Zip 1 (SPZ1) acts as a proto-oncogene and an upstream regulator of EMT during tumorigenesis. Here we report that the HIV-1 Tat-interacting protein 60 kDa (Tip60) acetyltransferase mediates acetylation at lysine residues of SPZ1 at positions 369 and 374, and of TWIST1 at positions 73 and 76, which are required for SPZ1–TWIST1 complex formation and cancer cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic SPZ1 and TWIST1 expression, but not that of TWIST1 alone, enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression via the recruitment of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), thus enhancing RNA-Pol II-dependent transcription and inducing metastasis. Neutralization of VEGF using humanized monoclonal antibodies such as Avastin, effectively abrogated the EMT and oncogenesis induced by the acetylated SPZ1–TWIST1 complex. Our findings highlight the importance of acetylation signaling in the SPZ1–TWIST1–BRD4 axis in the mediation of EMT and its regulation during tumor initiation and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2889245360,"ATP-binding cassette (ABC) is one of the two major superfamilies of transporters present across the evolutionary scale. ABC superfamily members came to prominence due to their ability to extrude broad spectrum of substrates and to confer multi drug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of some ABC transporters in clinical isolates of Candida species was attributed to the development of MDR phenotypes. Among Candida species, Candida glabrata is an emerging drug resistant species in human fungal infections. A comprehensive analysis of such proteins in C. glabrata is required to untangle their role not only in MDR but also in other biological processes. Bioinformatic analysis of proteins encoded by genome of human pathogenic yeast C. glabrata identified 25 putative ABC protein coding genes. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, domain organization and nomenclature adopted by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) scheme, these proteins were categorized into six subfamilies such as Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR)/ABCG, Multi Drug Resistance (MDR)/ABCB, Multi Drug Resistance associated Protein (MRP)/ABCC, Adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDp)/ABCD, RNase L Inhibitor (RLI)/ABCE and Elongation Factor 3 (EF3)/ABCF. Among these, only 18 ABC proteins contained transmembrane domains (TMDs) and were grouped as membrane proteins, predominantly belonging to PDR, MDR, MRP, and ALDp subfamilies. A comparative phylogenetic analysis of these ABC proteins with other yeast species revealed their orthologous relationship and pointed towards their conserved functions. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of putative membrane localized ABC protein encoding genes of C. glabrata confirmed their basal expression and showed variable transcriptional response towards antimycotic drugs. This study presents first comprehensive overview of ABC superfamily proteins of a human fungal pathogen C. glabrata, which is expected to provide an important platform for in depth analysis of their physiological relevance in cellular processes and drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2889550009,"Assuming that dispersal modes or abilities can explain the different responses of organisms to geographic or environmental distances, the distance-decay relationship is a useful tool to evaluate the relative role of local environmental structuring versus regional control in community composition. Based on continuing the current theoretical framework on metacommunity dynamics and based on the predictive effect of distance on community similarity, we proposed a new framework that includes the effect of spatial extent. In addition, we tested the validity of our proposal by studying the community similarity among three biotic groups with different dispersal modes (macrofaunal active and passive dispersers and plants) from two pond networks, where one network had a small spatial extent, and the other network had an extent that was 4 times larger. Both pond networks have similar environmental variability. Overall, we found that environmental distance had larger effects than geographical distances in both pond networks. Moreover, our results suggested that species sorting is the main type of metacommunity dynamics shaping all biotic groups when the spatial extent is larger. In contrast, when the spatial extent is smaller, the observed distance-decay patterns suggested that different biotic groups were mainly governed by different metacommunity dynamics. While the distance-decay patterns of active dispersers better fit the trend that was expected when mass effects govern a metacommunity, passive dispersers showed a pattern that was expected when species sorting prevails. Finally, in the case of plants, it is difficult to associate their distance-decay patterns with one type of metacommunity dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2889021523,"Evidence is emerging that the interaction between male seminal fluid and female tissues promotes fertility, pregnancy, and health of offspring. This includes the acceleration of ovulation in a species known as a spontaneous ovulator, the domestic pig. Earlier studies revealed that seminal plasma acts by a local mechanism in the female pig. The aim of the present study was to examine local short-term and mid-term effects of seminal plasma (SP) on mRNA expression of immunoregulatory genes and transcripts associated with follicle- and oocyte maturation. In the porcine animal model, effects on mRNA expression in the female tract and preovulatory follicles were examined. SP suppressed mRNA expression of Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase 2 (PTGS2) ipsilateral to the infused uterine horn which was associated with a lower presence of immune cells in the uterine epithelium and lower PTGS2 immunoreaction. Depending on the sampling time (2 h vs. 17 h) and hormonal status, SP altered significant correlative relations of mRNA expression between PTGS2 and the transcripts Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha-Induced Protein 6 and Pentraxin 3 in uterus, granulosa and cumulus cells. A modulatory effect of SP on the oocyte gene network comprising eight oocyte transcripts was observed: uterine exposure to SP induced positive correlations (r >0.08, p<0.05) of maturation promoting factors among each other and with cumulus cells on the side of the treated horn. In conclusion, SP orchestrates the gene network regulating the bidirectional communication between oocytes and surrounding somatic cells. The modulation of the immune-cytokine network of the female reproductive system could contribute to the previously reported SP-induced acceleration of ovulation in the porcine species."

Exposed patients or health care providers may seek alternative resources for these products online. The purpose of our study was to analyze the online availability of oncology shortage drugs at national and at international levels in 2014 and 2016. Methods We tested the online accessibility of oncology shortage drugs by simulating the Internet search method of patients. Search results were evaluated according to operational, distributional, and patient safety characteristics. Results In 2014 and 2016 all (100%) antineoplastic agents affected by shortages were available on the Internet without medical prescription. The number of relevant websites among search engine results has decreased from 112 to 98, while online vendors actually offering oncology shortage drugs for sale has risen from 66.1% to 80.6% within relevant websites in the two evaluated years. None of the online sellers were classified as legitimate or accredited by LegitScript and VIPPS online pharmacy verification databases. Conclusion According to our findings shortage oncology drugs are widely available online. To manage shortages and illegal Internet trade national and international standardized shortage reporting and information systems, regularly updated Internet pharmacy verification databases are needed.

Human IGF2 and mouse Igf2 genes are located within a conserved linkage group and are regulated by parental imprinting, with IGF2/Igf2 being expressed from the paternally derived chromosome, and H19 from the maternal chromosome. Here, data retrieved from genomic and gene expression repositories were used to examine the Igf2 gene and locus in 8 terrestrial vertebrates, 11 ray-finned fish, and 1 lobe-finned fish representing >500 million years of evolutionary diversification. The analysis revealed that vertebrate Igf2 genes are simpler than their mammalian counterparts, having fewer exons and lacking multiple gene promoters. Igf2 genes are conserved among these species, especially in protein-coding regions, and IGF2 proteins also are conserved, although less so in fish than in terrestrial vertebrates. The Igf2 locus in terrestrial vertebrates shares additional genes with its mammalian counterparts, including tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), insulin (Ins), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L23 (Mrpl23), and troponin T3, fast skeletal type (Tnnt3), and both Th and Mrpl23 are present in the Igf2 locus in fish. Taken together, these observations support the idea that a recognizable Igf2 was present in the earliest vertebrate ancestors, but that other features developed and diversified in the gene and locus with speciation, especially in mammals. This study also highlights the need for correcting inaccuracies in genome databases to maximize our ability to accurately assess contributions of individual genes and multigene families toward evolution, physiology, and disease.

Collectively, these results demonstrate that some common components responsible for controlling IGF2/Igf2 gene expression and IGF2 function appear to have been present in the earliest ancestors of extant mammals, but because there is significant variability in H19 gene structure, in the ICR, and in transcriptional enhancers, other regulatory elements appear to have developed during species diversification.

Results based on the combinatorial analysis of public genomic and gene expression databases reveal remarkable conservation of overall locus organization and similarity of Igf2 exons and IGF2 proteins in >500 Myr of evolutionary diversification, and they support the idea that the Igf2 gene and its locus are phylogenetically ancient in vertebrates. For this analysis, chicken Igf2 was selected as the reference gene for terrestrial vertebrates, primarily because it has been more highly studied than any of the other species found in the Ensembl and UCSC Genome browsers. According to a single peer-reviewed publication (37.Darling D.C. Brickell P.M. Nucleotide sequence and genomic structure of the chicken insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) coding region.Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1996; 102 (8804558): 283-28710.1006/gcen.1996.0071Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and information found in both genome databases as of August 2018, the single-copy chicken Igf2 gene consists of 3 exons and spans 8343 bp of genomic DNA on chromosome 5 (Fig. 1A). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene were not defined in any of these resources, and no promoter was characterized. In fact, in contrast to what is normal eukaryotic gene structure (41.Cazzola M. Skoda R.C. Translational pathophysiology: a novel molecular mechanism of human disease.Blood. 2000; 95 (10828006): 3280-3288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Kozak M.

Based on these results, it was clear that the chicken Igf2 gene was incomplete. The NCBI nucleotide database contains two different experimentally determined chicken Igf2 cDNAs. The longer one, XM_015286525, consists of 3369 nucleotides and includes both 5′ and 3′ UTRs, and the shorter one contains primarily coding information. By using the larger cDNA sequence to search the chicken genome, a potential new exon was found within the Igf2 locus 5′ to the presumptive exon 1 noted above. This new exon contained both coding and noncoding DNA. Mapping with the chicken Igf2 cDNA also added 9 bp to the 5′ end of Ensembl-defined exon 1, and it resulted in identification of a potential splice donor region being located adjacent to these extra nucleotides (Fig. S1). Subsequent analyses of Igf2 gene expression by using adjacent 60-bp segments found within the new 5′ exon to query chicken liver RNA-Seq libraries found in the SRA NCBI database identified several potential additional features of the chicken Igf2 gene. Based on these new results, presumptive exon 1 appeared to be ∼568 bp in length and consisted of 108 bp of coding DNA and ∼460 bp of 5′ UTR (Fig. 1B). Moreover, a potential TATA box, which helps position RNA polymerase II at the start of transcription (43.Gill G. Transcriptional initiation. Taking the initiative.Curr.

However, examination of the region further 5′ using the Promoter 2.0, CNN Promoter, and the UC Berkeley Neural Network Promoter prediction software did not identify many typical components of vertebrate proximal promoters. Thus, although these data extend general understanding of the architecture of the chicken Igf2 gene, neither the beginning of the gene nor its promoter has been fully established yet. Genome mapping with the Igf2 cDNA also extended the 3′ end of the last chicken Igf2 exon and identified two potential 3′ ends (Fig. 1, C and D). These two regions, which are separated by ∼535 bp, each have typical characteristics of polyadenylation sites, including a “AATAAA” poly(A) recognition sequence and a putative poly(A) addition site 17 or 21 bp 3′ to this element (Fig. 1C) (45.Sheets M.D. Ogg S.C.

Taken together, the results described above indicate that the chicken Igf2 gene spans at least 16,499 bp on chromosome 5, contains at least 4 exons and 3 introns, and potentially encodes two protein precursors, but a single mature IGF2 (Fig. 1, D and E, and Table 1).Table 1Organization of terrestrial vertebrate Igf2 genesSpeciesExon 1Intron 1Exon 2Intron 2Exon 3Intron 3Exon 4LengthChicken (G. gallus)56856011666420167740284016,499Turkey (M. gallopavo)271aData were found in cDNA and could not be mapped to genomic DNA.1668484167714237911,908Duck (A. platyrhynchos)464bThis is a poor-quality DNA sequence.<55191666127167740228615,448Zebra finch (T. guttata)48182101666624167445266018,660Flycatcher (F. albicollis)474bThis is a poor-quality DNA sequence.76165117500167450255719,207Ch softshell turtle (P. sinensis)12618,026163134251671027285635,783Anole lizard (A. carolinensis)NDcND indicates no DNA sequence detected.16359591671099375911,146Frog (X. tropicalis)180 or 5915,283 or 27,386163661416796944125,263 or 36,772a Data were found in cDNA and could not be mapped to genomic DNA.b This is a poor-quality DNA sequence.c ND indicates no DNA sequence detected. Open table in a new tab By using as genomic database queries the four chicken Igf2 exons and species-homologous cDNAs found in the NCBI nucleotide database, Igf2 also appeared to be a 4-exon gene in duck, zebra finch, flycatcher, and Chinese softshell turtle, a 3-exon gene in Anole lizard, and a 5-exon gene in frog. It also probably is a 4-exon gene in turkey, although the first exon, which is over 99% identical to the chicken homologue, could not be mapped to the turkey genome, most likely because of poor DNA sequence quality (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2). Moreover, in several of the species examined, the annotated genomic data were as incomplete as those for chicken Igf2 (e.g. three exons and no 5′ or 3′ UTRs in turkey and Anole lizard and three exons in flycatcher) or appeared to be unlikely (five proposed exons in duck, including two of 95 and 31 bp separated by a 34-bp intron). When all of the newly identified and mapped information was evaluated, these vertebrate Igf2 genes appeared to be far simpler than their mammalian homologues, which have up to 10 exons, including several noncoding exons, and up to 5 promoters (human and other primate IGF2 genes) (18.Rotwein P.

Using gene expression profiling, we found two copper starvation–induced proteins for supercomplex formation.

CtiP deletion caused a growth defect similar to that produced by deletion of subunit I of cytochrome aa3, increased copper tolerance, triggered expression of the copper-deprivation stimulon under copper sufficiency, and prevented co-purification of the supercomplex subunits. The secreted Cg1884 protein, named CopC, had a C-terminal transmembrane helix and contained a Cu(II)-binding motif.

Early career researchers in the US worked on average 6.3 hours more per week than researchers in Germany. In Germany, female early career researchers with children had drastically reduced work hours (around 8 hours per week) compared to male researchers with children and compared to female researchers without children, whereas we found no such effect for U.S. researchers. In addition, we asked how long respondents would ideally want to work (ideal work hours), and results revealed similar effects for ideal work hours.

https://openalex.org/W2889032049,"Fathers are underrepresented in interventions focussing on child well-being, yet research suggests their involvement may be critical to enhancing intervention effectiveness. This study aimed to provide the first Australian benchmark of rates of father attendance across several child mental health services. Retrospective casefile reviews were conducted to obtain data on father and mother attendance at 10 Australian child mental health services. A total of 2128 casefile records were retrospectively examined to extract family-level data. The main outcome measures were rates of father and mother attendance at sessions involving parents, and rates of father- and mother-instigated referral to services. Across services, fathers attended on average 48.2% (range 39.7% to 72.0%) of total parent sessions, with an average of 68.4% (range 53.1% to 88.1%) of fathers attending at least one session. Mothers attended sessions at significantly higher rates; an average of 92.8% of total parent sessions and 96.9% attendance for at least one session. For self-referred families, on average 12.6% of referrals were from fathers, and 87.4% were from mothers. These results indicate that rates of father attendance at Australian child mental health services vary, but are significantly lower than attendance rates for mothers. This may compromise the quality and outcomes of child mental health services in Australia. Routine monitoring of rates of father attendance is needed, as are strategies to enhance father engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2889158235,"Over the past half-century, large mammal populations have declined substantially throughout East Africa, mainly due to habitat loss and unsustainable direct exploitation. While it has been acknowledged that the loss of large mammals can have direct and cascading effects on community composition and ecosystem characteristics, limited quantitative work has been done on how declines of large herbivore populations impacts the abundance of mutualistic symbionts. Using a space-for-time observational approach, we quantified the large mammal community alongside the densities, host preferences and behaviors of mutualistic red-billed oxpeckers (Buphagus erythrorhynchus), and yellow-billed oxpeckers (Buphagus africanus) in northern Tanzania. At the landscape scale, mammal community composition was substantially less diverse in highly human-dominated areas when compared with more protected areas, with an observed complete loss of large wild mammal species in two study areas. Mirroring this trend, oxpecker densities were lowest in the least protected areas, and highest in fully protected areas. Using resource selection functions implemented via generalized linear models at different scales, we found that oxpeckers (1) were predominantly (67% of red-billed oxpeckers; 70% of yellow-billed oxpeckers) feeding on larger (between 500kg and 1500kg) ungulate host species within the mammal community, (2) usually preferred feeding on larger individuals (adults and males) within a specific host species population, and (3) preferred hosts that were more tolerant of their presence. In particular, cattle were especially intolerant of oxpecker presence and were relatively effective in displacing oxpeckers. We found little evidence that oxpecker feeding was parasitic across all host species; wound feeding was only observed on giraffe, comprising 6% and 4% of feeding behavior in red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers respectively. Thus, a loss of large-bodied and oxpecker tolerant host species is a likely explanation for declines of oxpecker populations in human dominated landscapes, which may have further cascading effects."
https://openalex.org/W2889327969,"A hallmark of proliferative retinopathies, such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), is a pathological neovascularization orchestrated by hypoxia and the resulting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent response. We studied the role of Hif2α in hematopoietic cells for pathological retina neovascularization in the murine model of ROP, the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model. Hematopoietic-specific deficiency of Hif2α ameliorated pathological neovascularization in the OIR model, which was accompanied by enhanced endothelial cell apoptosis. That latter finding was associated with up-regulation of the apoptosis-inducer FasL in Hif2α-deficient microglia. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of the FasL reversed the reduced pathological neovascularization from hematopoietic-specific Hif2α deficiency. Our study found that the hematopoietic cell Hif2α contributes to pathological retina angiogenesis. Our findings not only provide novel insights regarding the complex interplay between immune cells and endothelial cells in hypoxia-driven retina neovascularization but also may have therapeutic implications for proliferative retinopathies.—Korovina, I., Neuwirth, A., Sprott, D., Weber, S., Sardar Pasha, S.

https://openalex.org/W2889156557,"Feature selection is considered to be one of the most critical methods for choosing appropriate features from a larger set of items. This task requires two basic steps: ranking and filtering. Of these, the former necessitates the ranking of all features, while the latter involves filtering out all irrelevant features based on some threshold value. In this regard, several feature selection methods with well-documented capabilities and limitations have already been proposed. Similarly, feature ranking is also nontrivial, as it requires the designation of an optimal cutoff value so as to properly select important features from a list of candidate features. However, the availability of a comprehensive feature ranking and a filtering approach, which alleviates the existing limitations and provides an efficient mechanism for achieving optimal results, is a major problem. Keeping in view these facts, we present an efficient and comprehensive univariate ensemble-based feature selection (uEFS) methodology to select informative features from an input dataset. For the uEFS methodology, we first propose a unified features scoring (UFS) algorithm to generate a final ranked list of features following a comprehensive evaluation of a feature set. For defining cutoff points to remove irrelevant features, we subsequently present a threshold value selection (TVS) algorithm to select a subset of features that are deemed important for the classifier construction. The uEFS methodology is evaluated using standard benchmark datasets. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed uEFS methodology provides competitive accuracy and achieved (1) on average around a 7% increase in f-measure, and (2) on average around a 5% increase in predictive accuracy as compared with state-of-the-art methods."

Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying prion propagation and transmission is therefore critical for developing molecular strategies for disease intervention. We have shown previously that impaired quality control mechanisms directly influence prion propagation. In this study, we manipulated cellular quality control pathways in vitro by stably and transiently overexpressing selected quality control folding (ERp57) and cargo (VIP36) proteins and investigated the effects of this overexpression on prion propagation. We found that ERp57 or VIP36 overexpression in persistently prion-infected neuroblastoma cells significantly reduces the amount of PrPSc in immunoblots and prion-seeding activity in the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. Using different cell lines infected with various prion strains confirmed that this effect is not cell type– or prion strain–specific. Moreover, de novo prion infection revealed that the overexpression significantly reduced newly formed PrPSc in acutely infected cells.

Methods In total, 2364 middle-aged and elderly women were included in this cross-sectional, community-based survey. Obesity was assessed using body mass index (BMI). The outcome variable was sickness situation over the past two weeks (two-week morbidity).

https://openalex.org/W2888773167,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) has been shown to play a role in intestinal regeneration and colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. However, the role of Stat3 in the Wnt-driven sporadic intestinal tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We examined the roles of Stat3 in intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis by organoid culture experiments using Stat3ΔIEC mouse–derived intestinal epithelial cells in which Stat3 was disrupted. The regeneration of intestinal mucosa and organoid formation were significantly suppressed by Stat3 disruption, which was compensated by Wnt activation. Furthermore, once organoids were recovered, Stat3 was no longer required for organoid growth. These results indicate that Stat3 and Wnt signaling cooperatively protect epithelial cells at the early phase of intestinal regeneration. In contrast, intestinal tumorigenesis was not suppressed by Stat3 disruption in adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)Δ716 and ApcΔ716 Tgfbr2ΔIEC mice, thus indicating that Stat3 is not required for Wnt activation–driven intestinal tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, Itga5 and Itga6 were down-regulated by Stat3 disruption, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation was also suppressed. Notably, FAK inhibitor suppressed the organoid formation of wild-type epithelial cells. These results indicate that Stat3 is indispensable for the survival of epithelial cells through the activation of integrin signaling and the downstream FAK pathway; however, it is not required for the Wnt signaling-activated normal or tumor epithelial cells.—Oshima, H., Kok, S.-Y., Nakayama, M., Murakami, K., Voon, D.

Public debt is chosen by popular vote, pays for public goods, and is repaid with general taxes. We use an optimal control model to derive a theoretical benchmark. With a single generation, public debt is accumulated prudently. With multiple and over-lapping generations, the burden of debt and the risk of over-indebtedness are shifted to future generations. We find a weak but significant sign of intergenerational altruism, observing that the revealed debt preferences increase as the number of following generations decreases. However, we find considerably fewer intergenerational fairness concerns than one would expect on the basis of the behavioral and experimental literature. Instead, political debt cycles that vary with voters’ age emerge. Debt ceiling mechanisms fail to encourage intergenerational altruism and do not mitigate the problem of burden shifting."

Methods Both qualitative and quantitative methods of enquiry were used. A focus group study explored the musculoskeletal consequences of surgery as perceived by the women (n = 15) and their healthcare professionals (n = 11). A questionnaire survey was administered (n = 159), including a range of outcome measures to quantify both the physical and psychosocial impact of LD breast reconstruction. Dyad interviews were also conducted in order to determine the impact of surgery on function and activities of daily living (ADL) from the woman’s perspective and that of her significant other (n = 8). Results The qualitative studies highlighted a lack of preparedness and unrealistic expectations regarding functional recovery among women and their significant others’. Post-surgery it was apparent that women weighed up reduced shoulder function against survival, demonstrating resilience in their approach to coping with this adaptive way of living. The survey identified low to moderate effect on the outcomes assessed (n = 159), however, node removal significantly impacted certain aspects of quality of life (p<0.05) and disability (p = 0.04). Conclusions Breast reconstruction using the LD had an impact on shoulder function and some ADL, which impacted not only on the women but also family and significant others. Despite the functional implications associated with surgery, findings would suggest that shoulder dysfunction is not their main concern. This work identified that women and their significant other require further information to clarify expectation regarding recovery, highlighting the changing priorities of women throughout their journey from diagnosis into long-term recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2889478653,"Cellular secretory products have infinite potential, which is only recently explored for research and therapeutic applications. The present study elaborated on the formation of a unique matrix-entrapped cellular secretome (MCS), a hydrogel-like secretome produced by bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells when cultured on a three-dimensional electrospun nanofiber matrix under specific conditions. These culture conditions support the growth of a mixed population predominantly comprising of endothelial precursor cells (EPCs), along with mesenchymal stromal cells and pericytes. Interestingly, such secretome is not formed in a pure culture of EPCs on the similarly formulated matrix, suggesting that a heterotypic cell-cell interaction is essential for the formation of MCS. In addition, the specific composition of the matrix was found to be a critical necessity for the formation of MCS. Furthermore, the application of the MCS as a substrate promotes the growth of EPCs in culture. It also rescues the diabetes-induced EPC dysfunction as assessed based on the parameters, such as viability, proliferation, colony formation, cellular adhesion, chemotactic migration, and tubule formation. MCS augments the levels of eNOS-specific mRNA (Nos3) and also promotes the restoration of the SDF1/CXCR4 axis in diabetic EPCs. Notably, a topical application of MCS on diabetic wounds leads to an accelerated wound closure. Thus, the current data showed that MCS forms an excellent cell-free biomaterial in the treatment of diabetic wounds and non-healing ulcers."

A growing number of mutations have been identified in individuals with PXE. For most of these variants, no mechanistic information is available regarding their role in normal and pathophysiologies. To assess how PXE-associated mutations alter ABCC6 biosynthesis and structure, we biophysically and biochemically evaluated the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. A high-resolution X-ray structure of nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of human ABCC6 was obtained at 2.3 Å that provided a template on which to evaluate PXE-causing mutations. Biochemical analysis of mutations in this domain indicated that multiple PXE-causing mutations altered its structural properties. Analyses of the full-length protein revealed a strong correlation between the alterations in NBD properties and the processing and expression of ABCC6. These results suggest that a significant fraction of PXE-associated mutations located in NBD1 causes changes in its structural properties and that these mutation-induced alterations directly affect the maturation of the full-length ABCC6 protein.

The mineralization and subsequent degradation of elastic fibers leads to a progressive loss of tone in the affected tissues, resulting in vascular disease, intestinal bleeding, and loss of vision.

ABCC6 is a member of the C subfamily of ABC transporters, which includes the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), sulfonyl urea receptor (SUR) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (10.Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. The human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily.Genome Res. 2001; 11 (11435397): 1156-116610.1101/gr.GR-1649RCrossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). The functional protein is composed of five domains: two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2) and three transmembrane domains (TMD0, TMD1, and TMD2). The cytosolic NBDs bind and hydrolyze ATP, providing the energy for solute movement. Each of the nucleotide-binding domains contains two ATP-binding “half-sites” comprised of canonical Walker A, Walker B, and LSGGQ signature sequences (11.Moody J.E. Millen L. Binns D. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J. Cooperative, ATP-dependent association of the nucleotide binding cassettes during the catalytic cycle of ATP-binding cassette transporters.J. Biol.

Nucleotide binding leads to the dimerization of the NBDs, resulting in the formation of two complete functional sites formed by the in trans association of the Walker A and B sequences from one monomer with the LSGGQ sequence from the opposing monomer. The fully formed active sites then hydrolyze ATP and dissociate. The ABCC subfamily of transporters, including ABCC6, is partially defined by a degenerate Walker B sequence in the N-terminal NBD (NBD1), a substitution of an aspartate for a glutamate, which potentially influences ATP hydrolysis (Walker B: ABCC, φφφφDD; consensus: φφφφDE; φ, hydrophobic amino acid). The ATP-mediated association-dissociation reaction leads to conformational changes in the TMDs that are putatively associated with solute transport through the core TMDs (TMD1 and TMD2). The function of the N-terminal TMD (TMD0) is not known, although it has been implicated in regulating ABCC6 trafficking and protein–protein interactions in other ABCC family members (ABCC8/SUR1) (12.Miglionico R.

Over 200 different mutations have been identified in abcc6, likely impacting all aspects of gene regulation, protein biosynthesis, stability, trafficking, and function (13.Miksch S. Lumsden A.

Recent studies suggest that alterations to the biosynthesis and trafficking of ABCC6 influence a subset of PXE-causing mutations, although the detailed mechanisms of how these mutations alter ABCC6 structure is unknown (5.Iliás A.

In addition, recent studies suggest that ABCC6 misfolding can be partially corrected, suggesting that reversion of these basic defects could be leveraged for therapeutic development (17.Pomozi V.

To better understand the effects of PXE-associated mutations and their impacts on ABCC6 structure and biosynthesis, a combination of structural and biochemical experiments were employed to evaluate ABCC6 variants. Crystallographic studies of NBD1 provide experimental data on its structure at 2.3 Å and the first experimental structures of ABCC6. Analysis of NBD1 and full-length ABCC6 expression suggest that many variants impact the structural properties of NBD1 in isolation. The changes in NBD1 structural properties are well correlated with the expression of the full-length ABCC6 transporter. These studies provide insight into the disruption of ABCC6 biosynthesis and structure as a molecular pathology associated with the development of PXE. The human ABCC6 protein is composed of five distinct domains: three transmembrane domains and two cytosolic, nucleotide-binding domains (Fig. 1). Structures of homologous proteins, from mammalian and bacterial species, provide a template on which to model the structure of ABCC6. These include the mammalian ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC8/SUR1 structures solved by EM, as well as multiple bacterial ABC proteins that have been solved by X-ray crystallography (18.Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

Although these structures provide a template on which to generate ABCC6 models, no experimental structures of ABCC6 have been solved to date. Multiple sequence alignments and existing structures were used to predict the boundaries of human ABCC6 NBD1 for biochemical and structural analyses (Fig. 2). The canonical Walker A and Walker B sequences are highly conserved across the ABCC subfamily and more broadly across the entire family of ABC proteins (Figs. 1 and 2). As with other members of the ABCC subfamily, the extended Walker B sequences in NBD1 of ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC8/SUR1 also deviate from the canonical φφφφDE sequence with a substitution of Asp for the ultimate Glu residue (22.Moitra K. Dean M. Evolution of ABC transporters by gene duplication and their role in human disease.Biol. Chem. 2011; 392 (21194360): 29-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequences coordinate nucleotide triphosphate, water, and Mg2+ ions for the hydrolytic reaction. Other conserved sequences are also identified in the ABCC family alignment. The A-loop Trp residue, which interacts with the bound adenosine moiety via ring stacking interactions, is invariant in the human ABCC NBD1 sequences. Similarly, the Q-loop Gln residue, which serves as a putative switch to sense nucleotide binding and regulate NBD conformational changes, is also invariant. The H-loop catalytic His residue is also conserved across the ABCC NBD1 proteins with the exception of CFTR NBD1. Two insertion sites are present in the alignment of ABCC NBD1 sequences. A large insertion is seen near the N terminus of ABCC5, CFTR, ABCC11, and ABCC12. This insertion occurs between the first two β-strands and in CFTR is only partially ordered (19.Lewis H.A. Buchanan S.G. Burley S.K. Conners K. Dickey M. Dorwart M. Fowler R. Gao X. Guggino W.B. Hendrickson W.A. Hunt J.F. Kearins M.C. Lorimer D. Maloney P.C.

A second insertion site is present in ABCC8 and ABCC9. This insertion is also not ordered in the available structures (20.Lee K.P.K. Chen J. MacKinnon R.

Alignments of existing structures were curated using these conserved elements and used to define the N- and C-terminal boundaries of human ABCC6 NBD1. N- and C-terminal domain boundaries were iteratively refined during protein expression, purification, and crystallization trials to optimize soluble protein production in Escherichia coli and crystallization. Purification and crystallization studies identified optimal domain boundaries (positions 623–859) for the generation of soluble and stable protein that produced crystals. Using these domain boundaries, a single crystallization condition was identified for ABCC6 NBD1 that diffracted to 2.3 Å and was used for structure determination (Table 1). Crystals formed in 24–72 h in ammonium sulfate at near neutral pH and appeared as single and joined rods with protein concentrations between 10 and 12 mg/ml. Super stoichiometric ATP and Mg2+ was included in all protein buffers.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsData collection Resolution range40.79–2.3 (2.382–2.3) Space groupP 32 2 1 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)94.20, 94.20, 46.11 α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 120 Multiplicity5.94 (5.94) Completeness (%)99.85 (100.00) Mean I/σ(I)6.0 (2.2) Rmerge0.083 (0.299)Refinement No. of reflections10,707 (1041) Rwork20.99 (27.03) Rfree26.38 (33.56) Number of nonhydrogen atoms1885 Macromolecules1723 Ligands5 Solvent157 RMSDs Bond lengths (Å)0.004 Bond angles (°)0.66 Ramachandran plot Favored (%)98.68 Allowed (%)1.32 Outliers (%)0.00 Average B-factor27.53 Macromolecules27.31 Ligands19.01 Solvent30.30 Open table in a new tab The ABCC6 NBD1 structure is composed of three subdomains: a short antiparallel β-sheet, an α/β-core, and an α-helical subdomain (Figs. 2 and 3). The anti-parallel β-subdomain (β1, β2, β4, and β5) contains the highly conserved A-loop sequence associated with ring stacking with the nucleotide (Fig. 3B). The short linker between the first two strands, the insertion site identified in CFTR, ABCC11, and ABCC12, is well resolved in the ABCC6 NBD1 density. The α/β-core is defined by β3, α1, β6–10, and α6–9 (Figs. 2 and 3A, violet). This domain contains the canonical Walker A and B sequences as well as the H- and D-loops (Fig. 3B). This core region of the NBD is structurally highly conserved across the NBD proteins. The α-helical subdomain, critical for mediating TMD–NBD interactions, via the intracellular coupling helices, and signaling is composed of α2–5 (Figs. 2 and 3A, green). This domain is highly similar to those of ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC8/SUR1 when comparing both local structure and sequence similarity (20.Lee K.P.K. Chen J. MacKinnon R.

This subdomain contains the LSGGQ signature sequence and the structurally diverse region (Figs. 2 and 3, A and B). The structurally diverse region exhibits the highest B-factors in the ABCC6 NBD1 structure, similar to what has been observed in other NBD structures, suggesting increased mobility in the absence of other protein domains (Fig. 3C). The topology of the ABCC6 NBD is organized similarly to the canonical members of the family with re-entrant features in the β and α/β-core subdomains (Fig. 3D). The α-helical subdomain is the only region formed exclusively by continuous primary sequence. Although millimolar nucleotide was included in the protein buffer, the ABCC6 NBD1 protein crystallized in the nucleotide-free state. Efforts to crystallize NBD1 in the nucleotide-bound state have been, to date, unsuccessful. However, superposition of ABCC6 NBD1 with the solved structures of ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC8/SUR1 NBD1 provides a means on which to evaluate the nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in these domains (20.Lee K.P.K.

Nucleotide binding to the NBDs has been shown to induce a rigid body movement of the α-helical subdomain in many NBDs. ATP binding, sensed by the Q-loop, causes a rotation of the α-helical subdomain by roughly 15° in prototypical NBD models (24.Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J.

This conformational change is thought to be coupled to NBD–TMD interactions and to propagate the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis into the TMDs. Superposition of the ABCC6 nucleotide-free structure, determined here, with the ABCC1/MRP1 structures was performed by aligning the Walker A and Walker B sequences. By constraining the alignment to the Walker A and B sequences, ATP-dependent changes in the position of the α-helical subdomain can be evaluated. Comparison of the isolated ABCC1/MRP1 NBD1 in ATP bound (PDB code 2CBZ) and nucleotide-free (PDB code 4C3Z) states and the full-length ATP-bound structure (PDB code 6BHU) showed only minimal changes in protein conformation (Fig. 4A and Table 2) (23.Ramaen O.

The RMSD was <1.0 Å between all NBD1 structures. No significant rotation of the α-helical domain is observed in the comparison of the ABCC6 and ABCC1/MRP1 structures, regardless of nucleotide state (ATP-bound or nucleotide-free). Similarly, superposition of the ABCC6 NBD1 structure with that of ABCC8/SUR1 NBD1 shows only minimal changes in NBD conformation with an RMSD of 1.39 Å across the NBD structure and not including the ABCC8/ABCC9 unique insertion (Fig. 4B and Table 2) (20.Lee K.P.K.

Although no density for the ATP was identified in the ABCC6 NBD1 crystals, a single SO4 ion was modeled into electron density tightly coordinated by the Walker A sequence. This position would normally be occupied by the β-phosphate of a bound ATP molecule. The SO4 ion provided a reference by which Mg2+-ATP could be modeled into the structure of NBD1 using the nucleotide conformers from ABCC1/MRP1 (Fig. 4C). Minimal reorientation of the ATP molecule from the ABCC1/MRP1 structure (PDB code 2CBZ) was required to fit the adenosine moiety for a native ring-stacking interaction with conserved A-loop Trp (Trp638) and position the β-phosphate into the SO4 experimental density, as judged by superposition with other ATP-bound structures (23.Ramaen O.

Although large rigid body movements were not observed when evaluating the various ABCC NBD1 proteins, comparison of the various nucleotide-free and ATP-bound structures revealed conformational heterogeneity in the position of the catalytic residues across the ABCC proteins. The catalytic histidine (His812) side chain was readily visible in the electron density map of ABCC6 NBD1 and was oriented toward the active site, despite the lack of bound nucleotide (Fig. 4C). The His side chain was observed in multiple rotamers in the superposition of ABCC1/MRP1 and ABCC8/SUR1 structures (Fig. 4D). In contrast, minimal changes in the positions of the Walker B acidic residues were observed. The canonical Walker B Asp residue (Asp777, φφφφDD) was consistently seen oriented toward the active site and in position to coordinate the Mg2+ cofactor. The noncanonical Walker B Asp (Asp778, φφφφDD), associated with the ABCC subfamily NBD1 sequences, was oriented away from the active site in the ABCC structures. The side-chain carboxylate was positioned for hydrogen bonding to the backbone amide of the catalytic histidine (His812). To better understand how NBD1 structural properties might influence the biosynthesis of full-length ABCC6, PXE-associated variants in ABCC6 were selected for biochemical studies. ABCC6 mutations in the Leiden Open Variation Database (http://www.LOVD.nl/ABCC6) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. and NCBI ClinVar Database were selected for additional characterization in the isolated NBD1 protein. These protein variants display heterologous presentation across the PXE patient cohort and show only loose genotype-phenotype correlations (26.Legrand A. Cornez L. Samkari W. Mazzella J.M. Venisse A.

NBD folding was first assessed using an in-cell solubility assay, which has previously been used to characterize the folding and misfolding of multiple NBDs from ABC transporters. This system relies on the structural complementation of β-gal as a reporter for the soluble production of the protein of interest (27.Wigley W.C. Stidham R.D. Smith N.M. Hunt J.F. Thomas P.J.

The aim of the present study was to clarify the clinical benefit of post-nivolumab treatment in such patients. Materials and methods A retrospective review was conducted on patients who received treatment after cessation of nivolumab due to disease progression or adverse events at the Toneyama National Hospital between January 2016 and April 2017. Results Among 64 patients treated with nivolumab, 26 patients received treatment after cessation of nivolumab due to disease progression (n = 21) or adverse events (n = 5). The median age of the patients was 68 years and 19 patients were male. Nineteen patients had performance status (PS) 1 or less at initiation of post-nivolumab treatment. Four, 20, and 2 patients were treated with platinum doublets, a single agent, and molecular targeting agents, respectively. Response rate, disease control rate, and median progression-free survival of first-line post-nivolumab treatment were 34.6% (9 patients), 73.1% (19 patients), and 2.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7–5.2), respectively. Adverse events (≥ grade 3) and treatment cessation were observed in 57.7% (15 patients) and 19.2% (5 patients), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences for the majority of patient characteristics between the groups with (n = 26) and without post-nivolumab treatment. However, PS at cessation of nivolumab and post-progression survival (PPS) after cessation of nivolumab (median PPS: 12.6 vs. 1.4 months, 95% CI: 3.8–14.7 vs. 0.4–2.2) were significantly different between the groups. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed significant correlation of PS at cessation of nivolumab (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13–0.87) and post-nivolumab treatment (HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.08–0.43) with prolonged PPS after nivolumab. Conclusion Median post-progression survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who received post-nivolumab treatment was approximately 1 year."

A study now shows that the amino acid-induced change in the GTP/GDP-binding state of the Rag heterodimer paradoxically increases its dynamic release from the Ragulator at the lysosome and may limit mTORC1 activation.
https://openalex.org/W2889508216,"Perinatal hypertensive disorder including pre-eclampsia is a systemic syndrome that occurs in 3–5% of pregnant women. It can result in various degrees of brain damage. A recent study suggested that even gestational hypertension without proteinuria can cause cardiovascular or cognitive impairments later in life. We hypothesized that perinatal hypertension affects the brain functional connectivity (FC) regardless of the clinical manifestation of brain functional impairment. In the present study, we analyzed regional global connectivity (rGC) strength (mean cross-correlation coefficient between a brain region and all other regions) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to clarify brain FC changes associated with perinatal blood pressure using data from 16 women with a normal pregnancy and 21 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia. The rGC values in the bilateral orbitofrontal gyri were negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (dBP), which could not be explained by other pre-eclampsia symptoms. The strength of FC seeding at the left orbitofrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with dBP in the anterior cingulate gyri and right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that dBP elevation during pregnancy can affect the brain FC. Since FC is known to be associated with various brain functions and diseases, our findings are important for elucidating the neural correlate of cognitive impairments related to hypertension in pregnancy."

https://openalex.org/W2889074938,"Purpose Ultrasound methods for kidney stone imaging suffer from poor sensitivity and size overestimation. The study objective was to demonstrate feasibility of non-linear ultrasound beamforming methods for stone imaging, including plane wave synthetic focusing (PWSF), short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging, mid-lag spatial coherence (MLSC) imaging with incoherent compounding, and aperture domain model image reconstruction (ADMIRE). Materials and methods The ultrasound techniques were evaluated in an in vitro kidney stone model and in a pilot study of 5 human stone formers (n = 6 stones). Stone contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), sizing, posterior shadow contrast, and shadow width sizing were compared among the different techniques and to B-mode. CT imaging within 60 days was considered the gold standard stone size. Paired t-tests using Bonferroni correction were performed to evaluate comparing each technique with B-mode. Results Mean CT measured stone size was 6.0mm (range 2.9–12.2mm) with mean skin-to-stone distance 10.2cm (range 5.4–16.3cm). Compared to B-mode, stone contrast was best with ADMIRE (mean +12.2dB), while SLSC and MLSC showed statistically improved CNR. Sizing was best with ADMIRE (mean +1.3mm error), however this was not significantly improved over B-mode (+2.4mm). PWSF performed similarly to B-mode for stone contrast, CNR, SNR, and stone sizing. In the in vitro model, the shadow contrast was highest with ADMIRE (mean 10.5 dB vs 3.1 dB with B-mode). Shadow sizing was best with SLSC (mean error +0.9mm ± 2.9), however the difference compared to B-mode was not significant. Conclusions The detection and sizing of stones are feasible with advanced beamforming methods with ultrasound. ADMIRE, SLSC, and MLSC hold promise for improving stone detection, shadow contrast, and sizing."

https://openalex.org/W2889033231,"Questions concerning the ontogenetic stability of autism have recently received increased attention as long-term longitudinal studies have appeared in the literature. Most experimental measures are designed for specific ages and functioning levels, yet developing experimental tasks appropriate for a wide range of ages and functioning levels is critical for future long-term longitudinal studies, and treatment studies implemented at different ages. Accordingly, we designed an eye-tracking task to measure preferential orienting to facial features and implemented it with groups of participants with varying levels of functioning: infants, and school-age children with and without autism. All groups fixated eyes first, revealing an early and stable orienting bias. This indicates common bias towards the eyes across participants regardless of age or diagnosis. We also demonstrate that this eye-tracking task can be used with diverse populations who range in age and cognitive functioning. Our developmental approach has conceptual implications for future work focused on task development and particularly new experimental measures that offer measurement equivalence across broad age ranges, intellectual functioning and verbal abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2889529708,"Cardiac sympathetic tone overdrive is a key mechanism of arrhythmia. Cardiac sympathetic nerves denervation, such as LSG ablation or renal sympathetic denervation, suppressed both the prevalence of VAs and the incidence of SCD. Accumulating evidence demonstrates the ligament of Marshall (LOM) is a key component of the sympathetic conduit between the left stellate ganglion (LSG) and the ventricles. The present study aimed to investigate the roles of the distal segment of LOM (LOMLSPV) denervation in ischemia and reperfusion (IR)-induced VAs, and compared that LSG denervation. Thirty-three canines were randomly divided into group 1 (IR group, n = 11), group 2 (LOMLSPV Denervation + IR, n = 9), and group 3 (LSG Denervation + IR, n = 13). Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that LOMLSPV contained bundles of sympathetic but not parasympathetic nerves. IR increased the cardiac sympathetic tone [serum concentrations of noradrenaline (NE) and epinephrine (E)] and induced the prevalence of VAs [ventricular premature beat (VPB), salvo of VPB, ventricular tachycardia (VT), VT duration (VTD) and ventricular fibrillation (VF)]. Both LOMLSPV denervation and LSG denervation could reduce the cardiac sympathetic tone in Baseline (BS) [heart rate variability (HRV)]. Compared with group 1, LOMLSPV denervation and LSG denervation similarly reduced sympathetic tone [NE (1.39±0.068 ng/ml in group 2, 1.29±0.081 ng/ml in group 3 vs 2.32±0.17 ng/ml in group 1, P<0.05) and E (114.64±9.22 pg/ml in group 2, 112.60±9.69 pg/ml in group 3 vs 166.18±15.78 pg/ml in group 1, P<0.05),] and VAs [VT (0±3.00 in group 2, 0±1.75 in group 3 vs 8.00±11.00 in group 1, P<0.05) and VTD (0 ± 4 s in group 2, 0±0.88s in group 3 vs 10.0 ± 22.00s in group 1, P<0.05)] after 2h reperfusion. These findings indicated LOMLSPV denervation reduced the prevalence of VT by suppressing SNS activity. These effects are comparable to those of LSG denervation. In myocardial IR, the anti-arrhythmic effects of LOMLSPV Denervation may be related to the inhibition of the expression of NE and E."
https://openalex.org/W2888964409,"Inter-molecular epitope spreading during autoimmune pathogenesis leads to generation of new pathogenic epitopes on other autoantigens beyond the original one. It raises an important question as whether autoimmunity extends beyond the target tissues if new epitopes are on the molecules shared with other tissues. This study is aimed addressing this question in a rat anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) glomerulonephritis model induced by a T cell epitope of glomerulus-specific collagen4α3. We have demonstrated inter-molecular B cell epitope spreading. Four novel epitopes were first identified by screening a phage display random peptide library against autoantibodies isolated from the GBM of immunized rats. All four epitopes were derived from GBM proteins with three from laminins and one from collagen4α4. Three out of four synthetic peptides were nephritogenic. Importantly, two peptides from lamininα1 and lamininβ1, respectively, induced severe inflammation in glomeruli but not in the interstitial tissues, despite the presence of more abundant laminins in the tubular basement membranes. Our study suggests that surrounding tissues may display a lower or altered susceptibility to autoimmune inflammation. Thus, preventing extension of autoimmune inflammation beyond the original target tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2888986937,"Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 continues to pose a serious health threat to human beings. Cattle, a major reservoir of the pathogen, harbor E. coli O157:H7 in their gastrointestinal tract and shed variable concentrations of E. coli O157:H7 into the environment. Genetic characterization of cattle-shed E. coli O157 strains is of interest to the livestock industry, food business, and public health community. The present study applied whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) and single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling to characterize 279 cattle-shed E. coli O157:H7 strains isolated from a single feedlot located in southwestern region of the US. More than 4,000 SNVs were identified among the strains and the resultant phylogenomic tree revealed three major groups. Using the Sakai strain genome as reference, more than 2,000 SNVs were annotated and a detailed SNV map generated. Results clearly revealed highly polymorphic loci along the E. coli O157:H7 genome that aligned with the prophage regions and highly variant genes involved in processing bacterial genetic information. The WGS data were further profiled against a comprehensive virulence factor database (VFDB) for virulence gene identification. Among the total 285 virulence genes identified, only 132 were present in all the strains. There were six virulence genes unique to single isolates. Our findings suggested that the genome variations of the E. coli O157:H7 were mainly attributable to dynamics of certain phages, and the bacterial strains have variable virulence gene profiles, even though they came from a single cattle population, which may explain the differences in pathogenicity, host prevalence, and transmissibility by E. coli O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W2889248107,"The long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Superoxide has been implicated in the regulation of nerve growth factor (NGF), a mediator of sympathetic innervation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PPIs increase ventricular arrhythmias through magnesium-mediated superoxide production in infarcted rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to receive vehicle, omeprazole, omeprazole + magnesium sulfate, or famotidine treatment for 4 weeks starting 24 hours after the induction of myocardial infarction by ligating the coronary artery. Increased myocardial superoxide and nitrotyrosine levels were noted post-infarction, in addition to a significant upregulation of NGF expression on mRNA and protein levels. Sympathetic hyperinnervation after infarction was confirmed by measuring myocardial norepinephrine and immunofluorescent analysis. Compared with the vehicle, omeprazole-treated infarcted rats had significantly reduced myocardial magnesium content, increased oxidant production, and increased sympathetic innervation, which in turn increased ventricular arrhythmias. These effects were prevented by the coadministration of magnesium sulfate. In an in vivo study, an omeprazole-induced increase in NGF was associated with a superoxide pathway, which was further confirmed by an ex vivo study showing the attenuation of NGF levels after coadministration of the superoxide scavenger Tiron. Magnesium sulfate did not further attenuate NGF levels compared with omeprazole + Tiron. Our results indicate that the long-term administration of PPIs was associated with reduced tissue magnesium content and increased myocardial superoxide production, which exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias after infarction. Magnesium may be a potential target for PPI-related arrhythmias after infarction."
