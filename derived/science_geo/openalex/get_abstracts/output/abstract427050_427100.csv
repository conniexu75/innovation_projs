https://openalex.org/W1997188614,"The primary cause of Huntington's disease (HD) is expression of huntingtin with a polyglutamine expansion. Despite an absence of consensus on the mechanism(s) of toxicity, diminishing the synthesis of mutant huntingtin will abate toxicity if delivered to the key affected cells. With antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that catalyze RNase H-mediated degradation of huntingtin mRNA, we demonstrate that transient infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid of symptomatic HD mouse models not only delays disease progression but mediates a sustained reversal of disease phenotype that persists longer than the huntingtin knockdown. Reduction of wild-type huntingtin, along with mutant huntingtin, produces the same sustained disease reversal. Similar ASO infusion into nonhuman primates is shown to effectively lower huntingtin in many brain regions targeted by HD pathology. Rather than requiring continuous treatment, our findings establish a therapeutic strategy for sustained HD disease reversal produced by transient ASO-mediated diminution of huntingtin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2016910640,"Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndromes are sporadic overgrowth disorders associated with markedly enlarged brain size and other recognizable features. We performed exome sequencing in 3 families with MCAP or MPPH, and our initial observations were confirmed in exomes from 7 individuals with MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional subjects with megalencephaly, using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme assays and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K-AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism."
https://openalex.org/W2079701909,"De novo somatic mutations in focal areas are well documented in diseases such as neoplasia but are rarely reported in malformation of the developing brain. Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2001726213,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial to the health of the brain and is often compromised in neurological disease. Moreover, because of its barrier properties, this endothelial interface restricts uptake of neurotherapeutics. Thus, a renewable source of human BBB endothelium could spur brain research and pharmaceutical development. Here we show that endothelial cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) acquire BBB properties when co-differentiated with neural cells that provide relevant cues, including those involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The resulting endothelial cells have many BBB attributes, including well-organized tight junctions, appropriate expression of nutrient transporters and polarized efflux transporter activity. Notably, they respond to astrocytes, acquiring substantial barrier properties as measured by transendothelial electrical resistance (1,450 ± 140 Ω cm2), and they possess molecular permeability that correlates well with in vivo rodent blood-brain transfer coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W2061744336,"The function of neural circuits is an emergent property that arises from the coordinated activity of large numbers of neurons. To capture this, we propose launching a large-scale, international public effort, the Brain Activity Map Project, aimed at reconstructing the full record of neural activity across complete neural circuits. This technological challenge could prove to be an invaluable step toward understanding fundamental and pathological brain processes."
https://openalex.org/W1971887776,"Bone remodeling involves a coupled balance between bone resorption and bone formation. Xu Cao and his colleagues have shown before that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited to the surface of the bone during this process. They now show that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is released from the bone surface during bone resorption, where it signals the recruited MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts. In this way, bone resorption is linked to bone formation, and IGF-1 as a target of bone therapy is suggested. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the most abundant growth factor in the bone matrix, maintains bone mass in adulthood. We now report that IGF-1 released from the bone matrix during bone remodeling stimulates osteoblastic differentiation of recruited mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thus maintaining proper bone microarchitecture and mass. Mice with knockout of the IGF-1 receptor (Igf1r) in their pre-osteoblastic cells showed lower bone mass and mineral deposition rates than wild-type mice. Further, MSCs from Igf1rflox/flox mice with Igf1r deleted by a Cre adenovirus in vitro, although recruited to the bone surface after implantation, were unable to differentiate into osteoblasts. We also found that the concentrations of IGF-1 in the bone matrix and marrow of aged rats were lower than in those of young rats and directly correlated with the age-related decrease in bone mass. Likewise, in age-related osteoporosis in humans, we found that bone marrow IGF-1 concentrations were 40% lower in individuals with osteoporosis than in individuals without osteoporosis. Notably, injection of IGF-1 plus IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), but not injection of IGF-1 alone, increased the concentration of IGF-1 in the bone matrix and stimulated new bone formation in aged rats. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how IGF-1 maintains adult bone mass, while also providing a further rationale for its therapeutic targeting to treat age-related osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W1991236735,"The projection from the lateral habenula (LHb) to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) transmits negative reward–related information. Here the authors show that aversive stimuli increase LHb excitatory drive onto RMTg neurons, and optogenetic stimulation of this pathway is sufficient to induce active, passive and conditioned behavioral avoidance. Lateral habenula (LHb) projections to the ventral midbrain, including the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), convey negative reward–related information, but the behavioral ramifications of selective activation of this pathway remain unexplored. We found that exposure to aversive stimuli in mice increased LHb excitatory drive onto RMTg neurons. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of this pathway promoted active, passive and conditioned behavioral avoidance. Thus, activity of LHb efferents to the midbrain is aversive but can also serve to negatively reinforce behavioral responding."
https://openalex.org/W1968261149,"Different striatal projection neurons are the origin of a dual organization essential for basal ganglia function. We have defined an analogous division of labor in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of Parkinsonian rats, showing that the distinct temporal activities of two populations of GPe neuron in vivo are underpinned by distinct molecular profiles and axonal connectivities. A first population of prototypic GABAergic GPe neurons fire antiphase to subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, often express parvalbumin, and target downstream basal ganglia nuclei, including STN. In contrast, a second population (arkypallidal neurons) fire in-phase with STN neurons, express preproenkephalin, and only innervate the striatum. This novel cell type provides the largest extrinsic GABAergic innervation of striatum, targeting both projection neurons and interneurons. We conclude that GPe exhibits several core components of a dichotomous organization as fundamental as that in striatum. Thus, two populations of GPe neuron together orchestrate activities across all basal ganglia nuclei in a cell-type-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2014593879,"Host remodeling is important for the success of medical implants, including vascular substitutes. Synthetic and tissue-engineered grafts have yet to show clinical effectiveness in arteries smaller than 5 mm in diameter. We designed cell-free biodegradable elastomeric grafts that degrade rapidly to yield neoarteries nearly free of foreign materials 3 months after interposition grafting in rat abdominal aorta. This design focuses on enabling rapid host remodeling. Three months after implantation, the neoarteries resembled native arteries in the following aspects: regular, strong and synchronous pulsation; a confluent endothelium and contractile smooth muscle layers; expression of elastin, collagen and glycosaminoglycan; and tough and compliant mechanical properties. Therefore, future studies employing large animal models more representative of human vascular regeneration are warranted before clinical translation. This cell-free approach represents a philosophical shift from the prevailing focus on cells in vascular tissue engineering and may have an impact on regenerative medicine in general."
https://openalex.org/W2115814872,"While there are selective regions of occipitotemporal cortex that respond to faces, letters, and bodies, the large-scale neural organization of most object categories remains unknown. Here, we find that object representations can be differentiated along the ventral temporal cortex by their real-world size. In a functional neuroimaging experiment, observers were shown pictures of big and small real-world objects (e.g., table, bathtub; paperclip, cup), presented at the same retinal size. We observed a consistent medial-to-lateral organization of big and small object preferences in the ventral temporal cortex, mirrored along the lateral surface. Regions in the lateral-occipital, inferotemporal, and parahippocampal cortices showed strong peaks of differential real-world size selectivity and maintained these preferences over changes in retinal size and in mental imagery. These data demonstrate that the real-world size of objects can provide insight into the spatial topography of object representation."
https://openalex.org/W2081578346,"Here we demonstrate that the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) promotes robust regeneration of peripheral axons after nerve injury in mice. Peripheral axon regeneration is accelerated by prior injury; however, DLK KO neurons do not respond to a preconditioning lesion with enhanced regeneration in vivo or in vitro. Assays for activation of transcription factors in injury-induced proregenerative pathways reveal that loss of DLK abolishes upregulation of p-STAT3 and p-cJun in the cell body after axonal injury. DLK is not required for the phosphorylation of STAT3 at the site of nerve injury but is necessary for retrograde transport of p-STAT3 to the cell body. These data demonstrate that DLK enhances regeneration by promoting a retrograde injury signal that is required for the activation of the neuronal proregenerative program."
https://openalex.org/W2089620648,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway is critical for cellular growth and metabolism. Correspondingly, loss of function of PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K, or activating mutations in AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3 have been found in distinct disorders featuring overgrowth or hypoglycemia. We performed exome sequencing of DNA from unaffected and affected cells from an individual with an unclassified syndrome of congenital progressive segmental overgrowth of fibrous and adipose tissue and bone and identified the cancer-associated mutation encoding p.His1047Leu in PIK3CA, the gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, only in affected cells. Sequencing of PIK3CA in ten additional individuals with overlapping syndromes identified either the p.His1047Leu alteration or a second cancer-associated alteration, p.His1047Arg, in nine cases. Affected dermal fibroblasts showed enhanced basal and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP(3)) generation and concomitant activation of downstream signaling relative to their unaffected counterparts. Our findings characterize a distinct overgrowth syndrome, biochemically demonstrate activation of PI3K signaling and thereby identify a rational therapeutic target."

https://openalex.org/W2036420764,"Optogenetic silencing using light-driven ion fluxes permits rapid and effective inhibition of neural activity. Using rodent hippocampal neurons, we found that silencing activity with a chloride pump can increase the probability of synaptically evoked spiking after photoactivation; this did not occur with a proton pump. This effect can be accounted for by changes to the GABA(A) receptor reversal potential and demonstrates an important difference between silencing strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2077284522,"How information encoded in neuronal spike trains is used to guide sensory decisions is a fundamental question. In olfaction, a single sniff is sufficient for fine odor discrimination but the neural representations on which olfactory decisions are based are unclear. Here, we recorded neural ensemble activity in the anterior piriform cortex (aPC) of rats performing an odor mixture categorization task. We show that odors evoke transient bursts locked to sniff onset and that odor identity can be better decoded using burst spike counts than by spike latencies or temporal patterns. Surprisingly, aPC ensembles also exhibited near-zero noise correlations during odor stimulation. Consequently, fewer than 100 aPC neurons provided sufficient information to account for behavioral speed and accuracy, suggesting that behavioral performance limits arise downstream of aPC. These findings demonstrate profound transformations in the dynamics of odor representations from the olfactory bulb to cortex and reveal likely substrates for odor-guided decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1984345750,"A fundamental challenge in social cognition is how humans learn another person's values to predict their decision-making behavior. This form of learning is often assumed to require simulation of the other by direct recruitment of one's own valuation process to model the other's process. However, the cognitive and neural mechanism of simulation learning is not known. Using behavior, modeling, and fMRI, we show that simulation involves two learning signals in a hierarchical arrangement. A simulated-other's reward prediction error processed in ventromedial prefrontal cortex mediated simulation by direct recruitment, being identical for valuation of the self and simulated-other. However, direct recruitment was insufficient for learning, and also required observation of the other's choices to generate a simulated-other's action prediction error encoded in dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that simulation uses a core prefrontal circuit for modeling the other's valuation to generate prediction and an adjunct circuit for tracking behavioral variation to refine prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2080626878,"Oncogenic B-RAF V600E mutation is found in 50% of melanomas and drives MEK/ERK pathway and cancer progression. Recently, a selective B-RAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), received clinical approval for treatment of melanoma with B-RAF V600E mutation. However, patients on vemurafenib eventually develop resistance to the drug and demonstrate tumor progression within an average of 7 months. Recent reports indicated that multiple complex and context-dependent mechanisms may confer resistance to B-RAF inhibition. In the study described herein, we generated B-RAF V600E melanoma cell lines of acquired-resistance to vemurafenib, and investigated the underlying mechanism(s) of resistance. Biochemical analysis revealed that MEK/ERK reactivation through Ras is the key resistance mechanism in these cells. Further analysis of total gene expression by microarray confirmed a significant increase of Ras and RTK gene signatures in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. Mechanistically, we found that the enhanced activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is linked to Ras and MAPK activation, therefore conferring vemurafenib resistance. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the FGFR3/Ras axis restored the sensitivity of vemurafenib-resistant cells to vemurafenib. Additionally, activation of FGFR3 sufficiently reactivated Ras/MAPK signaling and conferred resistance to vemurafenib in the parental B-RAF V600E melanoma cells. Finally, we demonstrated that vemurafenib-resistant cells maintain their addiction to the MAPK pathway, and inhibition of MEK or pan-RAF activities is an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome acquired-resistance to vemurafenib. Together, we describe a novel FGFR3/Ras mediated mechanism for acquired-resistance to B-RAF inhibition. Our results have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of patients with B-RAF V600E melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1998899272,"Neuronal synchrony in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical for emotional behavior. Coordinated theta-frequency oscillations between the BLA and the hippocampus and precisely timed integration of salient sensory stimuli in the BLA are involved in fear conditioning. We characterized GABAergic interneuron types of the BLA and determined their contribution to shaping these network activities. Using in vivo recordings in rats combined with the anatomical identification of neurons, we found that the firing of BLA interneurons associated with network activities was cell type specific. The firing of calbindin-positive interneurons targeting dendrites was precisely theta-modulated, but other cell types were heterogeneously modulated, including parvalbumin-positive basket cells. Salient sensory stimuli selectively triggered axo-axonic cells firing and inhibited firing of a disctinct projecting interneuron type. Thus, GABA is released onto BLA principal neurons in a time-, domain-, and sensory-specific manner. These specific synaptic actions likely cooperate to promote amygdalo-hippocampal synchrony involved in emotional memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2113083385,"Growth of new dendritic spines contributes to experience-dependent circuit plasticity in the cerebral cortex. Yet the signaling mechanisms leading to new spine outgrowth remain poorly defined. Increasing evidence supports that the proteasome is an important mediator of activity-dependent neuronal signaling. We therefore tested the role of the proteasome in activity-dependent spinogenesis. Using pharmacological manipulations, glutamate uncaging, and two-photon imaging of GFP-transfected hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate that acute inhibition of the proteasome blocks activity-induced spine outgrowth. Remarkably, mutation of serine 120 to alanine of the Rpt6 proteasomal subunit in individual neurons was sufficient to block activity-induced spine outgrowth. Signaling through NMDA receptors and CaMKII, but not PKA, is required to facilitate spine outgrowth. Moreover, abrogating CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor abolished activity-induced spinogenesis.

The signaling pathways that mediate this circuit plasticity are thought to drive both functional and structural changes in existing synapses, as well as the addition of new synapses. In the mammalian cerebral cortex, the addition of new synapses during experience-dependent plasticity has been associated with the addition of dendritic spines (Comery et al., 1995Comery T.A. Shah R.

While new dendritic spines tend to be short lived (Trachtenberg et al., 2002Trachtenberg J.T. Chen B.E. Knott G.W. Feng G. Sanes J.R. Welker E. Svoboda K.

These data support that the formation and stabilization of new dendritic spines is a key structural component underlying synaptic plasticity. Although the detailed signaling mechanisms that initiate the outgrowth of new dendritic spines during experience-dependent plasticity remain poorly defined, there is strong evidence that increased neural activity can enhance new spine growth (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F.

What further signaling mechanisms act downstream of activity to initiate new spine growth? Over the past decade, evidence has been rapidly accumulating that the proteasome is an important mediator of activity-induced neuronal signaling (Bingol and Sheng, 2011Bingol B. Sheng M.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Moreover, activity-dependent changes in the rate of proteasome-mediated degradation can occur rapidly and can be localized to a small region of the stimulated dendrite (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B.

Chem. 2009; 284: 26655-26665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the proteasome is a key downstream mediator of localized activity-dependent neuronal signaling and therefore may play a role in activity-dependent spinogenesis. In this study, we used pharmacological and genetic manipulations in combination with time-lapse two-photon microscopy and two-photon glutamate uncaging to investigate the role of the proteasome in new spine growth on dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We show that acute inhibition of the proteasome rapidly reduces the rate of spine outgrowth. Synaptic activity, NMDA receptors, and CaMKII, but not PKA, are upstream regulators of proteasome-mediated spine outgrowth, which is dependent upon interaction between CaMKII and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. The S120 residue of the Rpt6 proteasomal subunit is critical for proteasome-dependent spine outgrowth in individual neurons, indicating that the proteasome acts postsynaptically and in a cell-autonomous manner to regulate spine outgrowth. Our data support a model in which synaptic activity promotes spine outgrowth via an NMDA receptor- and CaMKII-mediated regulation of local proteasomal degradation. To determine whether the proteasome plays a role in regulating the growth of new dendritic spines, we used pharmacological manipulations and time-lapse two-photon microscopy to measure the effect of acute inhibition of the proteasome on the rate of spine outgrowth. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons in organotypic slice cultures were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and imaged using a two-photon microscope. Dendrites of EGFP-expressing CA1 neurons were imaged at 15 or 20 min intervals before and after treatment with drugs or vehicle (Figure 1A ). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μM) reduced the rate of spine outgrowth to half (52% ± 12%) that of vehicle-treated control cells (100% ± 13%; p < 0.05; Figure 1B). Because MG132 inhibits the activity of calpains as well as the proteasome, we confirmed our findings with the proteasome-specific inhibitor lactacystin. Treatment with lactacystin (10 μM) reduced the rate of spine outgrowth by 68% (32% ± 7%) as compared to vehicle control (100% ± 13%; p < 0.001; Figure 1C). Similar reductions in spine outgrowth were observed for both apical and basal dendrites (see Figure S1A available online). The reduction in spine outgrowth due to lactacystin was not significantly different than that due to MG132 (p = 0.2), suggesting that reduced spine outgrowth in the presence of MG132 is specifically due to inhibition of the proteasome. To ensure that the effect of proteasome inhibition was saturated, we doubled the concentration of lactacystin in the bath. Treatment with 20 μM lactacystin resulted in a 62% reduction in new spine growth (38% ± 7%), which was not significantly different than that observed in the presence of 10 μM lactacystin (p = 0.6; Figure 1C), suggesting that spine outgrowth observed in the presence of lactacystin is proteasome independent. A variety of cellular processes, including the endocytosis of transmembrane proteins, are dependent on proteolysis-independent ubiquitination (Acconcia et al., 2009Acconcia F. Sigismund S. Polo S. Ubiquitin in trafficking: the network at work.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Hicke, 2001Hicke L. Protein regulation by monoubiquitin.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that a drop in free ubiquitin levels caused by proteasome inhibition (Schubert et al., 2000Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G. Yewdell J.W.

USA. 2000; 97: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) could interfere with new spine growth via a secondary effect on endocytosis. We think that this is unlikely for two reasons. First, the reduction in new spine growth in response to proteasomal inhibition was very rapid; we observed a significant reduction in spine outgrowth within 5 min of drug application (p < 0.05; Figure 1D). Second, a reduction in endocytosis might be expected to cause an increase in spine volume or density, as spine volume and stability are tightly linked to glutamate receptor content (Hsieh et al., 2006Hsieh H. Boehm J. Sato C. Iwatsubo T. Tomita T. Sisodia S. Malinow R. AMPAR removal underlies Abeta-induced synaptic depression and dendritic spine loss.Neuron. 2006; 52: 831-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, Matsuzaki et al., 2004Matsuzaki M. Honkura N. Ellis-Davies G.C. Kasai H. Structural basis of long-term potentiation in single dendritic spines.Nature. 2004; 429: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). Within the time course of our experiments, we saw no change in spine volume or spine density in response to MG132 treatment (data not shown). The lack of change in spine density might appear inconsistent with the significantly decreased rate of spine addition in response to MG132; however, because most new spines are transient, reduced new spine outgrowth is expected to be accompanied by reduced spine loss, which we observed (Figure S1B). Our data suggest that the reduction in new spine growth in response to proteasome inhibitors is due to acute inhibition of proteasomal activity. Because synaptic activity can enhance both spine outgrowth (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Dendritic spine changes associated with hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity.Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, Kwon and Sabatini, 2011Kwon H.B. Sabatini B.L. Glutamate induces de novo growth of functional spines in developing cortex.Nature. 2011; 474: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and the activity of the proteasome (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Djakovic et al., 2009Djakovic S.N. Schwarz L.A. Barylko B. DeMartino G.N. Patrick G.N. Regulation of the proteasome by neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26655-26665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the proteasome plays a role in regulating activity-induced spine outgrowth (Figure 2). Treatment with bicuculline (30 μM), which strongly enhanced synaptic activity (Figure S2), resulted in a 69% increase in spine outgrowth (169% ± 16%) relative to vehicle-treated controls (100% ± 13%; p < 0.05; Figures 2A and 2B). The activity-induced increase in spine outgrowth was blocked by concurrent application of MG132 (10 μM), which instead caused a 34% decrease in spine outgrowth (66% ± 9%; p < 0.05; Figure 2B), an effect that was indistinguishable from treatment with MG132 alone (p = 0.4). Thus, we conclude that proteasomal degradation is necessary for activity-induced spine outgrowth. Because bicuculline alters global neural activity levels in our slice cultures, we chose also to use a more localized dendritic stimulus to examine the role of the proteasome in activity-dependent spine outgrowth. A recent study using focal photolysis of caged glutamate demonstrated that direct glutamatergic stimulation of the dendrite can result in rapid spine outgrowth (Kwon and Sabatini, 2011Kwon H.B. Sabatini B.L. Glutamate induces de novo growth of functional spines in developing cortex.Nature. 2011; 474: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Using two-photon uncaging of MNI-glutamate and pharmacological inhibition, we examined whether proteasomal degradation is necessary for glutamate uncaging-induced spine outgrowth (Figures 2C and 2D). We found that uncaging-induced spine outgrowth was significantly reduced in the presence of lactacystin (15% success rate) as compared to control (36% success rate; p < 0.05; Figure 2E). This local activity-dependent spine outgrowth occurred with high spatial specificity such that most new spines (>87%) grew within 1 μm of the uncaging location. These results further demonstrate that proteasomal degradation acts to facilitate activity-dependent spine outgrowth in a spatially precise manner. Stimulation of proteasomal degradation by neural activity has been shown to occur via the action of NMDA receptors (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Djakovic et al., 2009Djakovic S.N. Schwarz L.A. Barylko B. DeMartino G.N. Patrick G.N. Regulation of the proteasome by neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26655-26665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which also have been shown to play a role in activity-induced outgrowth of new spines (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Dendritic spine changes associated with hippocampal long-term synaptic plasticity.Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, Kwon and Sabatini, 2011Kwon H.B. Sabatini B.L. Glutamate induces de novo growth of functional spines in developing cortex.Nature. 2011; 474: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Indeed, NMDA treatment increased the degradation of a fluorescent proteasome substrate in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in our cultured hippocampal slices (Figure S3). We therefore investigated the role of the NMDA receptor in proteasome-dependent new spine growth (Figures 2F and 2G). Inhibition of NMDA receptors with CPP (30 μM) resulted in a 62% reduction in spine outgrowth (38% ± 5%) as compared to vehicle control (100% ± 9%; p < 0.001; Figure 2G), suggesting that baseline spine outgrowth is partially activity dependent. The reduction in spine outgrowth observed after CPP treatment was not different than that after lactacystin treatment (p = 0.3), suggesting that the NMDA receptor and the proteasome act in the same pathway to induce new spine growth. To test this idea, we simultaneously applied lactacystin and CPP. Simultaneous treatment with both lactacystin and CPP resulted in a 53% reduction in new spine growth (47% ± 9%) as compared to vehicle control (100% ± 8%; p < 0.05; Figure 2G), a decrease that was not different than that observed in response to CPP (p = 0.7) or lactacystin (p = 0.3; Figure 1C) alone. Our data demonstrate that the NMDA receptor and the proteasome act in the same pathway to promote new spine growth in response to neural activity. Which signaling mechanisms act downstream of the NMDA receptor and the proteasome to translate neural activity into enhanced spine growth? Recent work has identified serine 120 of the Rpt6 proteasomal subunit as an important target site for CaMKII phosphorylation (Bingol et al., 2010Bingol B. Wang C.F. Arnott D. Cheng D. Peng J. Sheng M. Autophosphorylated CaMKIIalpha acts as a scaffold to recruit proteasomes to dendritic spines.Cell. 2010; 140: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, Djakovic et al., 2012Djakovic S.N. Marquez-Lona E.M. Jakawich S.K. Wright R. Chu C. Sutton M.A. Patrick G.N. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5126-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether the S120 residue of Rpt6 is necessary for activity-dependent spine outgrowth, we used time-lapse imaging to monitor new spine growth on dendrites of neurons transfected with EGFP alone or with both EGFP and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rpt6-WT or Rpt6-S120A (Figure 3A ). Expression levels were equivalent for both of the HA-tagged Rpt6 constructs, as verified through retrospective immunostaining (data not shown). As expected, we found that spine outgrowth increased in the presence of bicuculline for neurons transfected with EGFP alone (166% ± 13%, p < 0.05) or with EGFP and Rpt6-WT (161% ± 19%, p < 0.05) as compared to vehicle control (100% ± 11%; Figure 3B). Remarkably, neurons transfected with EGFP and Rpt6-S120A did not show a bicuculline-dependent increase in new spine growth and instead showed a 44% decrease in spine outgrowth (56% ± 8%; p < 0.05; Figure 3B), a level indistinguishable from the 55% decrease in outgrowth observed in vehicle-treated neurons expressing Rpt6-S120A (45% ± 5%; p = 0.4; Figure 3C). Treatment of Rpt6-S120A transfected cells with lactacystin did not further depress spine outgrowth (50% ± 5%; Figure 3C) compared to vehicle-treated Rpt6-S120A cells (p = 0.5), suggesting that the Rpt6-S120 residue is necessary for all proteasome-mediated spine outgrowth. Furthermore, treatment of Rpt6-S120A transfected cells with 30 μM CPP did not result in a further decrease in spine outgrowth (54% ± 6%; Figure 3C) compared to untreated Rpt6-S120A controls (p = 0.2), suggesting that the S120A residue of Rpt6 is a key regulatory site for proteasome- and NMDA receptor-dependent facilitation of new spine growth. Recent work has demonstrated that both PKA (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang F. Hu Y. Huang P. Toleman C.A. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Proteasome function is regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase through phosphorylation of Rpt6.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22460-22471Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and CaMKIIα (Djakovic et al., 2009Djakovic S.N. Schwarz L.A. Barylko B. DeMartino G.N. Patrick G.N. Regulation of the proteasome by neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26655-26665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) are capable of phosphorylating the Rpt6 subunit of the proteasome at serine 120. In addition, CaMKIIα has been shown to mediate activity-dependent recruitment of proteasomes to dendritic spines (Bingol et al., 2010Bingol B. Wang C.F. Arnott D. Cheng D. Peng J. Sheng M. Autophosphorylated CaMKIIalpha acts as a scaffold to recruit proteasomes to dendritic spines.Cell. 2010; 140: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Rpt6 by CaMKIIα increases the rate of proteasomal degradation (Djakovic et al., 2012Djakovic S.N. Marquez-Lona E.M. Jakawich S.K. Wright R. Chu C. Sutton M.A. Patrick G.N. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5126-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, both CaMKII (Jourdain et al., 2003Jourdain P. Fukunaga K. Muller D. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to activity-dependent filopodia growth and spine formation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10645-10649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PKA (Kwon and Sabatini, 2011Kwon H.B. Sabatini B.L. Glutamate induces de novo growth of functional spines in developing cortex.Nature. 2011; 474: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) have been implicated in activity-dependent spine outgrowth. We therefore chose to investigate the roles of CaMKII and PKA in activity- and proteasome-dependent new spine growth (Figures 4A and 4B ). Inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 (30 μM), which inhibits Ca2+- and CaM-dependent kinases, resulted in a 65% reduction in new spine growth (35% ± 6%) as compared to vehicle control (100% ± 11%; p < 0.001; Figure 4B). In contrast, the rate of new spine outgrowth was not significantly different from vehicle controls (100% ± 20%) when PKA was inhibited with either myristoylated PKI 14–22 amide (5 μM; 104% ± 11%; p = 0.9; Figure 4B) or Rp-cAMPS (20 μM; 120% ± 15%; p = 0.4; Figure 4B). In order to examine whether CaMKII inhibition might reduce spine outgrowth through blocking phosphorylation of Rpt6-S120, we treated Rpt6-S120A-transfected neurons with KN-93. Spine outgrowth in Rpt6-S120A-transfected neurons treated with KN-93 (42% ± 8%; Figure 4B) was not significantly different from KN-93-treated neurons (p = 0.8) or untreated Rpt6-S120A neurons (p = 0.7; Figure 3C), suggesting that CaMKII and the proteasome act in the same pathway to regulate spine outgrowth. Moreover, the reduction in new spine growth observed after KN-93 treatment was not significantly different than that after lactacystin (p = 0.5; Figure 1C) or CPP (p = 0.5; Figure 2G) treatment. Thus, our data suggest that CaMKII acts downstream of NMDA receptors to enhance local proteasomal activity via phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasomal subunit at serine 120. Because interrupting CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B has been shown to decrease spine density (Gambrill and Barria, 2011Gambrill A.C. Barria A. NMDA receptor subunit composition controls synaptogenesis and synapse stabilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 5855-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we examined whether this interaction is important for activity- and proteasome-dependent spine growth using GluN2B-L1298A/R1300Q knockin (GluN2B KI) mice (Halt et al., 2012Halt A.R. Dallapiazza R.F. Zhou Y. Stein I.S. Qian H. Juntti S. Wojcik S. Brose N. Silva A.J. Hell J.W. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is critical during memory consolidation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Both the L1298A and R1300Q mutations reduce GluN2B interaction with CaMKII by over 85% in vitro (Strack et al., 2000Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. Mechanism and regulation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II targeting to the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and these two mutations abrogate the activity-dependent increase in NMDA receptor-CaMKII interaction in vivo (Halt et al., 2012Halt A.R. Dallapiazza R.F. Zhou Y. Stein I.S. Qian H. Juntti S. Wojcik S. Brose N. Silva A.J. Hell J.W. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is critical during memory consolidation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether interaction of CaMKII with GluN2B is necessary for activity- and proteasome-dependent spine outgrowth, we transfected hippocampal slice cultures from WT and GluN2B KI mice with EGFP and examined the consequences of treatment with bicuculline (30 μM) or lactacystin (10 μM) on rates of spine outgrowth (Figures 4C and 4D). As expected, we found that treatment of WT mouse neurons with bicuculline resulted in a 50% increase in spine outgrowth (150% ± 14%) relative to vehicle-treated WT control neurons (100% ± 10%; p < 0.05; Figure 4D). Remarkably, treatment with bicuculline did not alter outgrowth in GluN2B KI neurons (93% ± 6%) relative to vehicle-treated GluN2B KI controls (100% ± 11%; p = 0.6; Figure 4D). Conversely, treatment with lactacystin reduced spine outgrowth in WT neurons by 69% (31% ± 6%) relative to vehicle-treated WT controls (100% ± 6%; p < 0.001), while GluN2B KI neurons were unaffected by lactacystin treatment (92% ± 12%) as compared to vehicle-treated GluN2B KI controls (100% ± 21%; p = 0.8; Figure 4D). Thus, we conclude that the interaction between CaMKII and GluN2B is necessary for activity- and proteasome-dependent spinogenesis. Surprisingly, we found that baseline spine outgrowth on GluN2B KI control neurons was not different than that on WT control neurons (Table S1; p = 0.7). We predict that compensatory mechanisms are involved, whereby GluN2B KI mice experience an increase in activity- and proteasome-independent spine outgrowth. To further confirm this possibility, we tested the effect of blocking NMDA receptors with CPP on spine outgrowth in WT and GluN2B KI mice. As expected, we found that treatment with CPP reduced spine outgrowth on neurons from WT mice by 42% (58% ± 9%) relative to vehicle-treated WT control neurons (100% ± 10%, p < 0.05) but had no effect on neurons from GluN2B KI mice (96% ± 12%) relative to vehicle-treated GluN2B KI controls (100 ± 24, p = 0.9; Figure S4). These data support that spine outgrowth on GluN2B KI neurons is both activity and proteasome independent. Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome can lead to presynaptic, postsynaptic, and potentially circuit-wide effects (Bingol and Sheng, 2011Bingol B. Sheng M. Deconstruction for reconstruction: the role of proteolysis in neural plasticity and disease.Neuron. 2011; 69: 22-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Tai and Schuman, 2008Tai H.C. Schuman E.M. Ubiquitin, the proteasome and protein degradation in neuronal function and dysfunction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Which site or sites of action are relevant for activity-induced new spine growth? We observed that expression of Rpt6-S120A in individual neurons inhibited activity-induced spine outgrowth. Because this genetic manipulation was carried out in sparsely transfected neurons, and thus any nearby presynaptic neurons were untransfected, our results demonstrate that postsynaptic proteasomal function is necessary to facilitate new spine growth. In addition, because global pharmacological inhibition was not more effective at reducing spine outgrowth than overexpression of Rpt6-S120A in individual postsynaptic cells, our data also suggest that independent presynaptic and circuit-wide effects do not contribute significantly to the observed reduction in new spine growth. Finally, uncaging-induced spine outgrowth, which is independent of presynaptic activity, was also significantly reduced by blocking the proteasome, emphasizing the role of localized postsynaptic signaling. Our results strongly support a postsynaptic site of action for the proteasome in activity-induced new spine outgrowth. How might synaptic activity and the proteasome act together to facilitate new spine growth? One possibility is that synaptic activity enhances proteasome function to cause the emergence of new spines. Alternatively, the synaptic stimulus could be the primary cause of spine outgrowth, and normal steady-state levels of proteasomal degradation are required for activity-induced new spine growth. We think that the latter possibility is unlikely because expression of Rpt6-S120A for 4 days does not produce any noticeable effects on cell health compared to untransfected neurons, suggesting that general proteasomal function is not significantly disrupted. In addition, the Rpt6-S120A mutation does not interfere with normal steady-state levels of proteasome-mediated protein degradation in heterologous cells (Djakovic et al., 2012Djakovic S.N. Marquez-Lona E.M. Jakawich S.K. Wright R. Chu C. Sutton M.A. Patrick G.N. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5126-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Instead, because the Rpt6-S120A mutation blocks CaMKII-mediated enhancement of proteasomal degradation (Djakovic et al., 2012Djakovic S.N. Marquez-Lona E.M. Jakawich S.K. Wright R. Chu C. Sutton M.A. Patrick G.N. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5126-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), our data suggest that locally enhanced proteasomal degradation, probably through CaMKII phosphorylation of Rpt6 at S120, is required for activity-induced new spine growth. How might neural activity translate to enhanced local proteasomal degradation? Changes in neuronal activity have been shown to alter both proteasome activity (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Djakovic et al., 2009Djakovic S.N. Schwarz L.A. Barylko B. DeMartino G.N. Patrick G.N. Regulation of the proteasome by neuronal activity and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 26655-26665Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and localization (Bingol and Schuman, 2006Bingol B. Schuman E.M. Activity-dependent dynamics and sequestration of proteasomes in dendritic spines.Nature. 2006; 441: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, Bingol et al., 2010Bingol B. Wang C.F.

Autophosphorylated CaMKIIalpha acts as a scaffold to recruit proteasomes to dendritic spines.Cell. 2010; 140: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although the relative contributions of changes in unit proteasome activity versus changes in proteasome localization to facilitating new spine outgrowth are not yet clear, our findings that spine outgrowth is reduced in mice with impaired NMDA receptor-CaMKII interaction support the possibility that relocation of the proteasome in response to activity may play a role in supporting new spine growth. In these GluN2B KI mice, activity-dependent association of CaMKII with the NMDA receptor is abrogated without altering CaMKII-T286 autophosphorylation, indicating that stimulus-induced activation of CaMKII is normal (Halt et al., 2012Halt A.R. Dallapiazza R.F. Zhou Y. Stein I.S. Qian H. Juntti S. Wojcik S. Brose N. Silva A.J. Hell J.W. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is critical during memory consolidation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, activity-dependent new spine growth could depend upon the local concentration of active proteasomes rather than stimulation of global proteasomal activity. What target proteins are degraded by the proteasome in order to stimulate new spine growth? Due to the rapid reduction in spinogenesis observed with proteasome inhibition, we expect that the immediate protein targets normally act to inhibit spine outgrowth and are rapidly turned over in an activity- and proteasome-dependent manner. Although a large number of proteins have been shown to regulate spine morphology and dynamics, the most promising candidates for regulating new spine outgrowth are those associated with regulation of the spine actin cytoskeleton (Tashiro and Yuste, 2004Tashiro A. Yuste R. Regulation of dendritic spine motility and stability by Rac1 and Rho kinase: evidence for two forms of spine motility.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 26: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Tolias et al., 2011Tolias K.F. Duman J.G. Um K. Control of synapse development and plasticity by Rho GTPase regulatory proteins.Prog. Neurobiol. 2011; 94: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). One promising candidate could be Ephexin5, a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor shown to negatively regulate excitatory synapse formation (Margolis et al., 2010Margolis S.S. Salogiannis J. Lipton D.M. Mandel-Brehm C. Wills Z.P. Mardinly A.R. Hu L. Greer P.L. Bikoff J.B. Ho H.Y. et al.EphB-mediated degradation of the RhoA GEF Ephexin5 relieves a developmental brake on excitatory synapse formation.Cell. 2010; 143: 442-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Another prime candidate could be Rap2, a member of the Ras family of GTPases. Rap2 overexpression causes a reduction in dendritic spine density (Ryu et al., 2008Ryu J. Futai K. Feliu M. Weinberg R. Sheng M. Constitutively active Rap2 transgenic mice display fewer dendritic spines, reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, enhanced long-term depression, and impaired spatial learning and fear extinction.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8178-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be a negative regulator of spinogenesis. Both of these candidates are plausible targets of activity-induced upregulation of proteasomal activity; in each case, enhanced degradation would be expected to lead to increased spine density. Malfunction of the proteasome (Tai and Schuman, 2008Tai H.C. Schuman E.M. Ubiquitin, the proteasome and protein degradation in neuronal function and dysfunction.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 826-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and alterations in dendritic spine morphologies and densities (Bhatt et al., 2009Bhatt D.H. Zhang S. Gan W.B. Dendritic spine dynamics.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) have independently been associated with neurological disorders resulting in mental retardation. Our data support a direct role for the proteasome in the activity-induced spinogenesis thought to be critical for normal brain function and for learning and memory. Disruption of proteasome-mediated degradation would be expected to interrupt activity-induced spine outgrowth during experience-dependent circuit modifications, suggesting one plausible mechanism by which proteasomal dysfunction may lead to neurological dysfunction. Hippocampal slices were prepared from postnatal day (P) 5–P7 Sprague-Dawley rats or wild-type or GluN2B KI mice (Halt et al., 2012Halt A.R. Dallapiazza R.F. Zhou Y. Stein I.S. Qian H. Juntti S. Wojcik S. Brose N. Silva A.J. Hell J.W. CaMKII binding to GluN2B is critical during memory consolidation.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1203-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), as described (Stoppini et al., 1991Stoppini L. Buchs P.A. Muller D. A simple method for organotypic cultures of nervous tissue.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2520) Google Scholar). Genes were delivered 2–5 days (EGFP alone) or 3–4 days (EGFP and Rpt6-WT or Rpt6-S120A) prior to imaging using biolistic gene transfer (180 PSI), as described (Woods and Zito, 2008Woods G. Zito K. Preparation of gene gun bullets and biolistic transfection of neurons in slice culture.J. Vis. Exp. 2008; 12: e675PubMed Google Scholar). We coated 1.6 μm gold beads with 10 μg of EGFP (Clontech) or with 10 μg EGFP and 25 μg HA-tagged Rpt6-WT or Rpt6-S120A (Djakovic et al., 2012Djakovic S.N. Marquez-Lona E.M. Jakawich S.K. Wright R. Chu C. Sutton M.A. Patrick G.N. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 regulates synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 5126-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). EGFP-transfected pyramidal neurons (5–12 days in vitro [DIV]) were imaged at 29°C in ACSF using a custom two-photon microscope (Woods et al., 2011Woods G.F. Oh W.C. Boudewyn L.C. Mikula S.K. Zito K. Loss of PSD-95 enrichment is not a prerequisite for spine retraction.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 12129-12138Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All images shown are maximum projections of three-dimensional (3D) stacks. Spine volumes, densities, and turnover rates were analyzed in 3D using custom software. Because spine addition rates can vary between cultures and experimental days, spine addition rates are reported as a percent of matched controls (calculated using all spines gained in the three posttreatment time points). Absolute spine addition and loss rates for all experiments are documented in Table S1. We prepared 1,000× stocks by dissolving MG132 (A.G. Scientific) and KN-93 (Tocris) in DMSO and bicuculline (Tocris), lactacystin (EMD Biochemicals), myristoylated PKI 14–22 amide (Tocris), Rp-cAMPS (Tocris), and CPP (Sigma) in water. Vehicle controls were matched in identity and volume to that in which the inhibitor was dissolved. When two drugs were applied, the vehicle consisted of the sum of the vehicles for both drugs. Slices were imaged at 30°C in magnesium-free ACSF containing 5 mM MNI-caged-glutamate. Image stacks were acquired immediately before and after the uncaging stimulus, which consisted of 50 pulses (720 nm, ∼12 mW at the sample) of 4 ms duration delivered at 5 Hz by parking the beam at a point ∼0.5 μm from the edge of a secondary or tertiary apical dendrite. No more than four uncaging trials were performed on the same neuron. The success rate of de novo spine outgrowth was determined by two blind evaluators. Comparison of success rate across conditions was made by Fisher's exact test. Error bars represent standard error of the mean and significance was set at p = 0.05 (two-tailed t test, unless otherwise noted). All statistics were calculated across cells. ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.001.

https://openalex.org/W2038733266,"It is becoming clear that interconnected functional gene networks, rather than individual genes, govern stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. To identify epigenetic factors that impact on human epidermal stem cells we performed siRNA-based genetic screens for 332 chromatin modifiers. We developed a Bayesian mixture model to predict putative functional interactions between epigenetic modifiers that regulate differentiation. We discovered a network of genetic interactions involving EZH2, UHRF1 (both known to regulate epidermal self-renewal), ING5 (a MORF complex component), BPTF and SMARCA5 (NURF complex components). Genome-wide localization and global mRNA expression analysis revealed that these factors impact two distinct but functionally related gene sets, including integrin extracellular matrix receptors that mediate anchorage of epidermal stem cells to their niche. Using a competitive epidermal reconstitution assay we confirmed that ING5, BPTF, SMARCA5, EZH2 and UHRF1 control differentiation under physiological conditions. Thus, regulation of distinct gene expression programs through the interplay between diverse epigenetic strategies protects epidermal stem cells from differentiation."

We found that impairment of Agouti-related protein (AgRP) circuitry by either Sirt1 knockdown in AgRP-expressing neurons or early postnatal ablation of these neurons increased exploratory behavior and enhanced responses to cocaine. In AgRP circuit-impaired mice, ventral tegmental dopamine neurons exhibited enhanced spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation, altered amplitude of miniature postsynaptic currents and elevated dopamine in basal forebrain. Thus, AgRP neurons determine the set point of the reward circuitry and associated behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2091936353,"Although studies on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure and dynamics have focused on the ER tubule-forming proteins (reticulons and DP1/Yop1p) and the tubule fusion protein atlastin, nothing is known about the proteins and processes that act to counterbalance this machinery. Here we show that Lnp1p, a member of the conserved Lunapark family, plays a role in ER network formation. Lnp1p binds to the reticulons and Yop1p and resides at ER tubule junctions in both yeast and mammalian cells. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the interaction of Lnp1p with the reticulon protein, Rtn1p, and the localization of Lnp1p to ER junctions are regulated by Sey1p, the yeast orthologue of atlastin. We propose that Lnp1p and Sey1p act antagonistically to balance polygonal network formation. In support of this proposal, we show that the collapsed, densely reticulated ER network in lnp1 Δ cells is partially restored when the GTPase activity of Sey1p is abrogated. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an intricate network of interconnected tubules. Sey1 is known to govern tubule formation, but the proteins that counteract tubule fusion remained unclear. Chen, Novick and Ferro-Novick propose that Lnp1 antagonizes the activity of Sey1 to modulate ER network formation."
https://openalex.org/W2104296698,"The basic, still unanswered question about visual object representation is this: what specific information is encoded by neural signals? Theorists have long predicted that neurons would encode medial axis or skeletal object shape, yet recent studies reveal instead neural coding of boundary or surface shape. Here, we addressed this theoretical/experimental disconnect, using adaptive shape sampling to demonstrate explicit coding of medial axis shape in high-level object cortex (macaque monkey inferotemporal cortex or IT). Our metric shape analyses revealed a coding continuum, along which most neurons represent a configuration of both medial axis and surface components. Thus, IT response functions embody a rich basis set for simultaneously representing skeletal and external shape of complex objects. This would be especially useful for representing biological shapes, which are often characterized by both complex, articulated skeletal structure and specific surface features."

In the intermediate zone, these migrating precursors move tangentially and initiate the extension of their axons by transiently adopting a characteristic multipolar morphology. We observe that expression of the forkhead transcription factor FoxG1 is dynamically regulated during this transitional period. By utilizing conditional genetic strategies, we show that the downregulation of FoxG1 at the beginning of the multipolar cell phase induces Unc5D expression, the timing of which ultimately determines the laminar identity of pyramidal neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that the re-expression of FoxG1 is required for cells to transit out of the multipolar cell phase and to enter into the cortical plate.

Construction of this network is dependent on the emergence of two major classes of cortical neurons, glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, both of which need to be produced and precisely assembled during the course of development (Barnes et al., 2008Barnes A.P.

Integration of neuronal clones in the radial cortical columns by EphA and ephrin-A signalling.Nature. 2009; 461: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Until recently, pyramidal neurons, which are generated locally within the cortical germinal zones (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), were thought to achieve their appropriate laminar positions exclusively through vertical migration along radial glial fibers. However, it is now recognized that pyramidal neuron precursors, like interneurons, tangentially disperse during their integration into the developing cortex (O'Rourke et al., 1992O'Rourke N.A. Dailey M.E. Smith S.J. McConnell S.K. Diverse migratory pathways in the developing cerebral cortex.Science. 1992; 258: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). During this phase, pyramidal neuron precursors within the intermediate zone transiently assume a characteristic “multipolar” morphology, detach from the radial glial scaffold, and initiate axonal outgrowth (Barnes et al., 2007Barnes A.P. Lilley B.N. Pan Y.A. Plummer L.J. Powell A.W. Raines A.N. Sanes J.R. Polleux F.

Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9996-10001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the importance of this multipolar migratory phase for assembling a mature cortical network and the precise genetic control of this stage are not well understood (LoTurco and Bai, 2006LoTurco J.J. Bai J. The multipolar stage and disruptions in neuronal migration.Trends Neurosci. 2006; 29: 407-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, we have observed that the forkhead box transcription factor FoxG1, previously identified as a critical regulator of early telencephalic development (Xuan et al., 1995Xuan S. Baptista C.A. Balas G. Tao W. Soares V.C. Lai E. Winged helix transcription factor BF-1 is essential for the development of the cerebral hemispheres.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1141-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), is expressed in a dynamic manner as pyramidal neurons transit through these migratory phases. Here, through the use of conditional genetic strategies, we demonstrate that the dynamic regulation of FoxG1 expression that normally occurs during the pyramidal cell multipolar stage is essential for the proper assembly of cerebral cortex. FoxG1 is known to play a central role in cortical development in that it regulates progenitor proliferation (Hanashima et al., 2002Hanashima C. Shen L. Li S.C. Lai E.

Neurosci. 2006; 9: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, studying FoxG1 gene function in postmitotic cells has proven challenging, as the constitutive loss of this gene results in gross developmental abnormalities, including the complete absence of subpallial structures (Xuan et al., 1995Xuan S. Baptista C.A. Balas G. Tao W. Soares V.C. Lai E. Winged helix transcription factor BF-1 is essential for the development of the cerebral hemispheres.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1141-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Hence, the function of FoxG1 during later stages of pyramidal neuron maturation has remained completely unexplored. The central importance of FoxG1 as an essential transcriptional regulator is underscored by the observation that even subtle alterations in FoxG1 expression levels can have profound effects on brain development. Mice with heterozygous mutations in the FoxG1 gene have impaired pallial development, suggesting that the cortex is highly sensitive to FoxG1 gene dosage (Eagleson et al., 2007Eagleson K.L. Schlueter McFadyen-Ketchum L.J. Ahrens E.T. Mills P.H. Does M.D. Nickols J. Levitt P.

Hayek G. Rondinella D. Artuso R. Mencarelli M.A. Spanhol-Rosseto A. Pollazzon M. Buoni S. Spiga O. Ricciardi S. et al.FOXG1 is responsible for the congenital variant of Rett syndrome.Am. J. Hum.

Moreover, duplication of the FoxG1 locus has been found in patients with epilepsy, mental retardation, and speech impairment (Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2011Brunetti-Pierri N. Paciorkowski A.R. Ciccone R. Mina E.D. Bonaglia M.C. Borgatti R. Schaaf C.P. Sutton V.R. Xia Z. Jelluma N. et al.Duplications of FOXG1 in 14q12 are associated with developmental epilepsy, mental retardation, and severe speech impairment.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 19: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that the precise regulation of FoxG1 expression is critical for proper brain development. We hypothesized that the dynamic expression of FoxG1 in pyramidal neuron precursors is critical for proper cortical development, and to test this, we utilized both genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Remarkably, we find that the observed dynamic variation in FoxG1 expression during pyramidal cell migration is crucial for the development of the cerebral cortex. Specifically, we find that a failure to downregulate FoxG1 at the beginning of the multipolar phase transiently stalls pyramidal neuron precursors within the lower intermediate zone as a result of failure to express Unc5D. Cells perturbed in this fashion were ultimately displaced to more superficial layers, and their laminar identity was respecified accordingly. Whereas the downregulation of FoxG1 was essential for pyramidal cell migration, the reinitiation of FoxG1 expression following Unc5D expression was also critical for cells to leave the multipolar cell phase and to enter into the cortical plate. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the dynamic expression of FoxG1 during the postmitotic multipolar cell phase critically regulates the assembly and integration of pyramidal neuron precursors into the cortical network. In the developing cerebral cortex, we found that FoxG1 expression is transiently downregulated in nascent pyramidal neuron precursors located at the lower portion of the intermediate zone (E14.5 Figures 1A and 1B; see other embryonic stages for Figures S1A, S1B, and S1C, available online). By comparing the expression of FoxG1 to other transcription factors expressed within the ventricular (VZ) and intermediate (IZ) zones (Hevner et al., 2006Hevner R.F. Hodge R.D. Daza R.A. Englund C.

Biol. 2008; 28: 1456-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D), we found that NeuroD1 expression, which is restricted to postmitotic cells (Mattar et al., 2008Mattar P. Langevin L.M. Markham K. Klenin N. Shivji S. Zinyk D. Schuurmans C. Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors cooperate to specify a cortical projection neuron identity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1456-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), is complementary to FoxG1 (Figures 1B and 1B′). In addition, we observed that the expression of Unc5D (Figure 1E), which has been shown to be exclusively expressed during the multipolar phase of pyramidal neuron development (Sasaki et al., 2008Sasaki S. Tabata H. Tachikawa K. Nakajima K. The cortical subventricular zone-specific molecule Svet1 is part of the nuclear RNA coded by the putative netrin receptor gene Unc5d and is expressed in multipolar migrating cells.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 38: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is initiated at the point at which FoxG1 expression is downregulated (Figure 1E, asterisk). By taking advantage of an inducible Cre (CreER) driver under the control of proneural gene Neurog2 (Zirlinger et al., 2002Zirlinger M. Lo L. McMahon J. McMahon A.P. Anderson D.J.

USA. 2002; 99: 8084-8089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which is transiently expressed at the time progenitors become postmitotic (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N. Castro D.S.

Asymmetric production of surface-dividing and non-surface-dividing cortical progenitor cells.Development. 2004; 131: 3133-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), we were able to sparsely label the multipolar cell population (Figures 1F and 1F′, see details of this method in Figures S1D to S1G). We found two distinct levels of FoxG1 expression within these genetically labeled multipolar cells (Figure 1G), suggesting that FoxG1 expression is dynamically regulated specifically during this phase. We confirmed that the majority of multipolar cells are postmitotic as they were not labeled by an acute pulse of EdU (DNA analog) (0%, n = 81) (Figure 1H) and did not express high levels of the Ki67 antigen (Miyata et al., 2004Miyata T. Kawaguchi A. Saito K. Kawano M. Muto T. Ogawa M. Asymmetric production of surface-dividing and non-surface-dividing cortical progenitor cells.Development. 2004; 131: 3133-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). We observed that these multipolar cells located near the ventricular zone express NeuroD1 (Figure 1I) and low levels of Tbr2, and, not surprisingly, most of them express Unc5D (Figure 1J) (Sasaki et al., 2008Sasaki S. Tabata H. Tachikawa K. Nakajima K. The cortical subventricular zone-specific molecule Svet1 is part of the nuclear RNA coded by the putative netrin receptor gene Unc5d and is expressed in multipolar migrating cells.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 38: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have further utilized in utero electroporation and found that FoxG1 downregulation occurs precisely at the beginning of the multipolar cell phase, at a time coincident with when NeuroD1 expression is initiated (see detailed analysis in Figures S1H and S1I). We refer to this NeuroD1-expressing stage as the “early phase” (Figure 1A). These cells subsequently upregulate FoxG1 levels at a period we designate as the “late phase” of multipolar cell migration, where NeuroD1 (but not Unc5D) has been downregulated (Figure 1A). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the dynamic regulation of FoxG1 activity during these multipolar cell transition phases is critical for the migration of cells through the intermediate zone and their integration into appropriate cortical layers. We next carried out FoxG1 gain-of-function experiments to test the importance of FoxG1 downregulation at the beginning of the multipolar cell phase. Using in utero electroporation, we transduced the E13.5 cortical ventricular zone with a control (pCAG-IRESEGFP; Figure 2A ) or a FoxG1 expression vector (pCAG-FoxG1-IRESEGFP; Figure 2B), both of which resulted in EGFP cell labeling from the ubiquitously expressed CAG promoter (Niwa et al., 1991Niwa H.

Three days after this manipulation, the majority of FoxG1 gain-of-function cells remained within the lower intermediate zone and possessed multipolar morphologies (Figure 2B, compare to control in Figure 2A). However, three days later at P0, FoxG1 gain-of-function cells are found inside the cortical plate (Figures 2C and 2D, bracket indicates cortical plate), suggesting that the failure in FoxG1 downregulation caused delay in migration but did not permanently restrict cells to the multipolar phase. We compared the location of these E13.5 electroporated cells to later-born cells by E14.5 EdU birthdating and found that in contrast to control cells (Figure 2C, compare the colored asterisks), FoxG1 gain-of-function cells within the cortical plate were intermingled with the population born at E14.5 (Figure 2D), suggesting that they are either still migrating or had become ectopically positioned. We further fate-mapped control and FoxG1 gain-of-function cells and at P3 found that, whereas control cells were positioned below those born at E14.5, FoxG1 gain-of-function cells were located more superficially (compare Figures S2A and S2B, colored asterisks). We next analyzed the molecular expression profiles at P7, a stage at which neuronal migration is largely complete (Figures 2E–2J). Consistent with previous findings (Takemoto et al., 2011Takemoto M. Hattori Y. Zhao H. Sato H. Tamada A. Sasaki S. Nakajima K. Yamamoto N. Laminar and areal expression of unc5d and its role in cortical cell survival.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we found that the majority of control cells electroporated at E13.5 were located in layer IV (Figures 2E–2G) and expressed molecular markers characteristic of that layer (RORβ-on, Brn2-low, and Cux1-on Figures 2E–2G, insets) (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). In contrast, the majority of FoxG1 gain-of-function cells were located in layers II/III (Figures 2H–2J) and showed molecular features consistent with their ectopic laminar location (Figures 2H–2J, insets, RORβ-off, Brn2-high, and Cux1-on). We conclude that failure to downregulate FoxG1 at the beginning of the multipolar cell phase delays cells from entering the cortical plate and results in a superficial shift in their location and marker profiles, indicating a shift in their laminar identity. We confirmed that this change in laminar identity did not result from postmitotic cells re-entering the cell cycle after FoxG1 gain-of-function (Figures S2C and S2D). We also ruled out the possibility that FoxG1 overexpression within the progenitor pool was responsible for the switch in laminar position. We restricted FoxG1 gain-of-function in postmitotic multipolar cells by using a NeuroD1 promoter expression vector (Figures S1H and S1I) and observed a similar delay in migration after 2 or 3 days of in utero electroporation (Figures S3A–S3D) and changes in laminar identity at postnatal stages (Figures S3E–S3H) as was observed upon broader FoxG1 gain-of-function experiments shown in Figure 2. We next tried to understand why a failure to downregulate FoxG1 at the beginning of the multipolar cell phase leads to delayed migration in the intermediate zone. Consistent with their multipolar morphology, these cells had already extinguished Tbr2 (Figure 3A ) but maintained NeuroD1 expression (Figure 3B, asterisk indicates the domain normally expressing NeuroD1), suggesting that they had failed to transit from the early to late multipolar cell phase (Figure 1A). Consistent with this idea, FoxG1 gain-of-function cells failed to express Unc5D (compare Figures 3C and 3C′ versus Figures 3D and 3D′), a protein whose expression is normally initiated shortly after the onset of NeuroD1 and maintained into the late multipolar phase (Figure 1A, also see Figures S3A–S3D for the similar absence of Unc5D expression in cells after postmitotic FoxG1 gain-of-function). Because NeuroD1 mis-expression by itself does not affect cell migration (Mattar et al., 2008Mattar P. Langevin L.M. Markham K. Klenin N. Shivji S. Zinyk D. Schuurmans C. Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors cooperate to specify a cortical projection neuron identity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1456-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the loss of Unc5D may be responsible for the delayed migration. We repeated the FoxG1 gain-of-function and rescued Unc5D expression specifically at the postmitotic multipolar phase (Figure 3F) by using a NeuroD1 promoter construct (Figures S1H and S1I). Remarkably, restoration of Unc5D expression in NeuroD1-positive cells partially rescued the migration phenotype in that there was a dramatic increase in cells that entered the cortical plate after 3 days (Figure 3F) compared to the ones that solely experienced FoxG1 gain-of-function (Figure 3E). We further examined whether Unc5D restoration in FoxG1 gain-of-function cells could also correct their altered laminar identity (Figure 2 and Figures S3E–S3H). Indeed, when Unc5D expression was restored in FoxG1 gain-of-function cells at the multipolar phase, we observed that by P7 a substantial number of them were now appropriately located in layer IV (Figure 3G) and possessed the correct molecular profile for this layer (Figures 3G′, 3H, and 3I, Cux1-on, Brn2-low, and RORβ-on, see also Figure 3J). How could Unc5D play such a critical role in regulating the early to late transitions within the multipolar cell phase? It has been shown that Unc5D is a receptor involved in Netrin-signaling in the postnatal cortex (Takemoto et al., 2011Takemoto M. Hattori Y. Zhao H. Sato H. Tamada A. Sasaki S. Nakajima K. Yamamoto N. Laminar and areal expression of unc5d and its role in cortical cell survival.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 1925-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, in the context of axonal guidance, alters the response of Dcc (Deleted in colorectal carcinoma) to Netrins in growth cone turning assays (Hong et al., 1999Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E.

We found that both Dcc and Unc5D are expressed within the intermediate zone (Figures S4A and S4B) and, in fact, are the only known Netrin receptor molecules expressed in this region (Unc5A, 5B, 5C, Neogenin, and Dscam are not expressed within the intermediate zone, see Figures S4C–S4H). However, unlike the downregulation of Unc5D we have observed in FoxG1 gain-of-function cells (Figure 3D), Dcc expression was not affected (data not shown). This sugges"
https://openalex.org/W2092412947,"Using an unbiased genetic screen in mice, Hartmut Geiger et al. found that the thrombomodulin–activated protein C pathway, which controls blood coagulation among other functions, also protects from radiation damage. Administration of a recombinant variant of thrombomodulin or of recombinant activated protein C protected mice from total body irradiation, pointing to potential therapeutic applications. Tissue damage induced by ionizing radiation in the hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems is the major cause of lethality in radiological emergency scenarios and underlies some deleterious side effects in patients undergoing radiation therapy1,2. The identification of target-specific interventions that confer radiomitigating activity is an unmet challenge. Here we identify the thrombomodulin (Thbd)–activated protein C (aPC) pathway as a new mechanism for the mitigation of total body irradiation (TBI)-induced mortality. Although the effects of the endogenous Thbd-aPC pathway were largely confined to the local microenvironment of Thbd-expressing cells, systemic administration of soluble Thbd or aPC could reproduce and augment the radioprotective effect of the endogenous Thbd-aPC pathway. Therapeutic administration of recombinant, soluble Thbd or aPC to lethally irradiated wild-type mice resulted in an accelerated recovery of hematopoietic progenitor activity in bone marrow and a mitigation of lethal TBI. Starting infusion of aPC as late as 24 h after exposure to radiation was sufficient to mitigate radiation-induced mortality in these mice. These findings suggest that pharmacologic augmentation of the activity of the Thbd-aPC pathway by recombinant Thbd or aPC might offer a rational approach to the mitigation of tissue injury and lethality caused by ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2062941431,"Selective ligands are lacking for many neuronal signaling proteins. Photoswitched tethered ligands (PTLs) have enabled fast and reversible control of specific proteins containing a PTL anchoring site and have been used to remote control overexpressed proteins. We report here a scheme for optical remote control of native proteins using a “photoswitchable conditional subunit” (PCS), which contains the PTL anchoring site as well as a mutation that prevents it from reaching the plasma membrane. In cells lacking native subunits for the protein, the PCS remains nonfunctional internally. However, in cells expressing native subunits, the native subunit and PCS coassemble, traffic to the plasma membrane, and place the native protein under optical control provided by the coassembled PCS. We apply this approach to the TREK1 potassium channel, which lacks selective, reversible blockers. We find that TREK1, typically considered to be a leak channel, contributes to the hippocampal GABAB response."
https://openalex.org/W1977222247,"Cellular wound healing, enabling the repair of membrane damage, is ubiquitous in eukaryotes. One aspect of the wound healing response is the redirection of a polarized cytoskeleton and the secretory machinery to the damage site. Although there has been recent progress in identifying conserved proteins involved in wound healing, the mechanisms linking these components into a coherent response are not defined. Using laser damage in budding yeast, we demonstrate that local cell wall/membrane damage triggers the dispersal of proteins from the site of polarized growth, enabling their accumulation at the wound. We define a protein-kinase-C-dependent mechanism that mediates the destruction of the formin Bni1 and the exocyst component Sec3. This degradation is essential to prevent competition between the site of polarized growth and the wound. Mechanisms to overcome competition from a pre-existing polarized cytoskeleton may be a general feature of effective wound healing in polarized cells."

Posttranslational modifications regulate diverse biological processes, and cross-talk among different posttranslational modifications fine-tunes and increases the complexity of cellular regulation. For example, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and sumoylation all contribute extensively toward the precise orchestration of the DNA damage response, upon which both cell viability and suppression of human disease critically depend.

The evolutionarily conserved SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), including human RNF4, budding yeast Slx5-Slx8, and fission yeast Rfp1/2-Slx8, catalyze the ubiquitylation of SUMO-modified proteins, which can target them for proteasome-mediated degradation (3Lallemand-Breitenbach V.

Consistent with this role, STUbL inactivation causes an accumulation of cellular SUMO-modified species, especially high molecular weight SUMO chains. Severe genomic instability and genotoxin hypersensitivity accompany the accumulation of SUMO chains, and in fission yeast, blocking SUMO chain formation mitigates these phenotypes (4Prudden J. Pebernard S. Raffa G. Slavin D.A. Perry J.J. Tainer J.A. McGowan C.H. Boddy M.N.

The last finding suggests that either a polysumoylated protein(s) dominantly interferes with key cellular processes or, that the SUMO chains are themselves toxic and the critical STUbL target. Although the relevant pathways that are perturbed by STUbL inactivation remain largely undefined, STUbL maintains genome stability, at least in part, by facilitating the removal of genotoxic covalent topoisomerase I (Top1)-DNA adducts (10Heideker J.

To further define the physiological impact of SUMO chains and their regulation by STUbL, we undertook a proteomics approach to identify proteins that can bind non-covalently to SUMO and/or SUMO chains in fission yeast. Intriguingly, we found the Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 (Cdc48-UN) protein complex was highly enriched among SUMO binding proteins. The Cdc48-UN complex is best known for its ubiquitin-mediated role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (11Stolz A. Hilt W. Buchberger A. Wolf D.H.

Here, we define a new role for Cdc48-UN as a STUbL cofactor in protecting cells from SUMO chain-mediated toxicity, and Top1-induced genome instability. Our data suggest that Cdc48-UN can be targeted to SUMO and ubiquitin co-modified substrates such as STUbL targets via an unprecedented combination of ubiquitin and SUMO recognition motifs in Ufd1. Standard yeast methods were performed as described previously (24Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Molecular genetic analysis of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3137) Google Scholar). Low fidelity PCR products covering the entire ufd1 locus were used to replace the genomic locus and generate the ufd1 temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles. The mutations within each mutant were identified via sequencing. Strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. The S. pombe SUMO chains were produced in Escherichia coli as described (9Prudden J. Perry J.J. Nie M. Vashisht A.A. Arvai A.S. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Wohlschlegel J.A. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N.

His6-tagged SUMO was purified from bacteria using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and eluted with 200 mm imidazole (see Fig. 1A). Purified SUMO chains were coupled to AffiGel-15 beads (Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.5). As a control, GST proteins were conjugated to AffiGel-10 beads in buffering containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6, 150 mm NaCl. Cells from the S. pombe SUMO deletion strain were lysed in Sp (S. pombe)-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm PMSF, and Complete protease inhibitor EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysate containing 50 mg of proteins was pre-cleared with GST-agarose at 4 °C for 2 h to adsorb nonspecific interacting proteins and subsequently incubated with SUMO chain agarose. Both GST and SUMO beads were washed extensively with Sp-lysis buffer and eluted by competition with monomeric SUMO (see Fig. 1A). To induce expression of GFP or mCherry-tagged proteins, cells were cultured in the absence of thiamine (B1) at 25 °C for 2 days. Slx8 inactivation was achieved by shifting temperature to 35 °C for 6 h. Wide-field fluorescence images of live cells were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse microscope with a 100× Plan Apochromat DIC H oil immersion objective and a Photometrics Quantix charge-coupled device camera. Images were analyzed with NIH ImageJ software. Strains expressing endogenous nmt41:FLAG-Top1 were cultured at 25 °C in the absence of B1 for 30 h. The cells were harvested, and native ChIP experiments without cross-linking were performed essentially as described (10Heideker J. Prudden J. Perry J.J. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N.

For each experiment, the percentage DNA recovery of ChIP samples relative to the DNA amount in the input was averaged over triplicate quantitative PCR measurements (Chromo4, Bio-Rad). Primer sequences for cnt2 (centromeric inner repeats of Chromosome 2), telo2R (subtelomeres of Chromosome 2), mes1 (upstream of mes1 on Chromosome 1), and rDNA2 (rDNA) have been published (25Hayashi M.

Membranes were then probed with IRDye800 or IRDye680 secondary antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences), and fluorescence was detected using the ODYSSEY Infrared Imaging system (LI-COR 117 Biosciences). Samples were denatured and then reduced and alkylated prior to overnight digestion with trypsin. The protein digests were loaded onto MudPIT columns that were placed inline with a 1200 quaternary HPLC pump (Agilent Technologies) and the eluted peptides were electrosprayed directly into an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a 10-step MudPIT method.

Yates 3rd., J.R. DTASelect and Contrast: Tools for assembling and comparing protein identifications from shotgun proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The S. pombe SUMO chains were produced as described above. GST-tagged Ufd1 or Ufd1AAA were expressed in BL21 cells and purified using glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Purified SUMO chains and GST-Ufd1 or GST-Ufd1AAA were combined in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 25 °C for 15 min prior to pulldown with GSH-Sepharose. After extensive washes with the binding buffer, proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced GSH and analyzed by Western blotting. We carried out a proteomic screen to identify SUMO binding proteins that may be involved in STUbL function. Immobilized SUMO chains (or control GST) were used to pull down proteins in cell lysates prepared from fission yeast lacking endogenous SUMO (SUMOΔ). Bound proteins were eluted using purified monomeric SUMO (Fig. 1A), and identified by mass spectrometry. Notably, the fission yeast orthologues of a number of known SUMO interactors were identified in the eluate from the SUMO chain but not the GST column (see supplemental Table S1). Among the SUMO-specific interactors, the Cdc48/p97 cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4 were the most highly represented, with ∼60% of their primary sequence covered by numerous independent peptides (see supplemental Table S1). This was intriguing, as the Ufd1-Npl4 heterodimer is well characterized and reported to bind ubiquitylated proteins (31Bays N.W. Hampton R.Y. Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4: Stuck in the middle with Ub.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R366-R371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we identified a potential SUMO interaction motif (SIM) in the last seven amino acids (DPIDIDA) of Ufd1, which deviates somewhat from the core consensus I/V-X-I/V-I/V or I/V-I/V-X-I/V sequence, but closely resembles the SIM found in the SUMO-2 binding protein CoREST1 (NPIDIEV; (32Ouyang J. Shi Y. Valin A. Xuan Y. Gill G. Direct binding of CoREST1 to SUMO-2/3 contributes to gene-specific repression by the LSD1/CoREST1/HDAC complex.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). Notably, the budding yeast Ufd1 protein also terminates with a SIM-containing sequence (EVIEID), which matches the core consensus motif I/V-I/V-X-I/V. Consistently, budding yeast Ufd1 was identified as a SUMO interactor in recent high throughput yeast two-hybrid analyses (33Hannich J.T. Lewis A. Kroetz M.B. Li S.J. Heide H. Emili A. Hochstrasser M.

Elg1, the major subunit of an alternative RFC complex, interacts with SUMO-processing proteins.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 2894-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the latter study, all Ufd1 clones identified encoded the C terminus of the protein but lacked various extents of the N terminus, indicating that the SUMO interaction site resides in the C terminus of Ufd1. However, neither the function nor the nature of the interaction (covalent versus non-covalent, direct versus indirect) was defined in those studies. Therefore, we tested for non-covalent interaction between Cdc48-UN and a non-conjugatable form of SUMO (SUMOAA) using pairwise yeast two-hybrid analyses. We determined that Ufd1 but neither Npl4 nor Cdc48 interacted with SUMO (Fig. 1B); and confirmed the known interaction between Ufd1 and Npl4 (35Meyer H.H. Shorter J.G. Seemann J. Pappin D. Warren G. A complex of mammalian ufd1 and npl4 links the AAA-ATPase, p97, to ubiquitin and nuclear transport pathways.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2181-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Removing the putative SIM, by deleting the last seven amino acids of the unstructured C terminus (Ufd1ΔCt) of Ufd1 abolished interaction with SUMO but did not affect the interaction between Ufd1 and Npl4 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, mutating the hydrophobic residues in the Ufd1 C-terminal SIM to alanine (DAADADA; Ufd1AAA) also abolished the interaction of Ufd1 with SUMO but not with Npl4 (Fig. 1C). To confirm that Ufd1 interacts directly and non-covalently with SUMO, we expressed and purified GST-Ufd1, GST-Ufd1AAA, and His6-SUMO chains from bacteria and tested their interactions in vitro. Compared with GST-Ufd1, which bound SUMO robustly, GST-Ufd1AAA showed only background levels of SUMO binding (Fig. 1D), consistent with our yeast two-hybrid analyses and proteomic approaches. Therefore, Ufd1 contains a bona fide C-terminal SIM that mediates direct and non-covalent interaction with SUMO in vitro. As anticipated for a protein that contains a single SIM and not the tandem arrangements observed in STUbL proteins (36Perry J.J. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. A SIM-ultaneous role for SUMO and ubiquitin.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we did not observe preferential binding of Ufd1 to the higher molecular weight SUMO chain species. We further confirmed that GST-Ufd1, but not GST-Npl4, interacts directly with SUMO (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our analyses thus far indicate that Cdc48-UN interacts non-covalently with SUMO via a SIM in Ufd1, which is conserved in the two distantly related fission and budding yeasts. We next tested the interaction of Ufd1 with SUMO chains in vivo. We previously showed that upon inactivation of the STUbL Slx8-Rfp1, SUMO chains accumulate to high levels, as detected by Western blotting (9Prudden J. Perry J.J. Nie M. Vashisht A.A. Arvai A.S. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Wohlschlegel J.A. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. DNA repair and global sumoylation are regulated by distinct Ubc9 noncovalent complexes.Mol.

Biol. 2009; 16: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, here we found that GFP-SUMO forms one to two nuclear foci in slx8–29 temperature-sensitive cells, and both the frequency and size of these foci dramatically increased upon a shift from permissive (25 °C) to restrictive temperature (35 °C; Fig. 2A). These foci represent an accumulation of localized SUMO chains, as when all (SUMOK0) or major (SUMOK14R,K30R) SUMO acceptor lysines were mutated to arginine, these foci were either not observed or were greatly diminished, respectively (Fig. 2A) (9Prudden J. Perry J.J. Nie M. Vashisht A.A. Arvai A.S. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Wohlschlegel J.A. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. DNA repair and global sumoylation are regulated by distinct Ubc9 noncovalent complexes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Strikingly, mCherry-Ufd1 also formed intense foci in slx8-29 cells at restrictive temperature, which tightly colocalized with the GFP-SUMO foci (Fig. 2B). Underscoring our biochemical and genetic data, deletion or mutation of the Ufd1 SIM completely abrogated the formation of Ufd1 foci, and colocalization with SUMO (Fig. 2B; Ufd1ΔCt Ufd1AAA). Furthermore, in slx8-29 cells expressing GFP-SUMOK0, which is unable to form chains or foci, the mCherry-Ufd1 signal remained diffuse (Fig. 2C). However, in GFP-SUMOK14R,K30R expressing slx8-29 cells, mCherry-Ufd1 again formed foci that both colocalized with (Fig. 2C) and matched the reduced size of SUMO foci in this background (see Fig. 2A). This result also indicates that Ufd1 does not require a specific SUMO chain topology, as alternative acceptor sites are used to form the limited chains in the SUMOK14R,K30R background (9Prudden J. Perry J.J. Nie M. Vashisht A.A. Arvai A.S. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Wohlschlegel J.A. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. DNA repair and global sumoylation are regulated by distinct Ubc9 noncovalent complexes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, as alluded to above, we believe that the single SIM present in Ufd1 is unlikely to favor binding of the protein to SUMO chains over monomeric SUMO. However, SUMO chains could potentially provide binding sites for multiple Ufd1 proteins. Overall, we have demonstrated that Ufd1 interacts with SUMO non-covalently and that it colocalizes with SUMO in vivo, in a SIM-dependent manner. STUbL mutants exhibit genome instability and are hypersensitive to genotoxins, due to defects in SUMO-dependent protein regulation (9Prudden J. Perry J.J. Nie M. Vashisht A.A. Arvai A.S. Hitomi C. Guenther G. Wohlschlegel J.A. Tainer J.A. Boddy M.N. DNA repair and global sumoylation are regulated by distinct Ubc9 noncovalent complexes.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 2299-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As Ufd1 physically and may also functionally intersect with the SUMO pathway, we tested whether hypomorphic Ufd1 mutants were also sensitive to DNA damaging agents. Ufd1 is essential for viability, so we generated a number of temperature-sensitive alleles that were expressed from the endogenous ufd1 locus (Fig. 3A). All except one of the eight ufd1 ts alleles we identified contain point mutations within the conserved UFD1 domain. Western blot analysis revealed that the ufd1-1 allele, which was used in subsequent experiments, became destabilized upon shifting of temperature from permissive (25 °C) to non-permissive (35 °C) conditions (data not shown). As expected, the growth of the majority of Ufd1 mutant strains was strongly inhibited at restrictive temperature (Fig. 3B). At semi-permissive temperature, Ufd1 mutants were hypersensitive to a number of genotoxins, including the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, and the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (Fig. 3B). Therefore, similar to STUbL, fission yeast Ufd1 plays a key role in cell survival following genotoxic stress. The known roles of Cdc48-UN in proteolysis, together with our findings that it interacts with SUMO and is required for cellular resistance to DNA damaging agents, suggested to us that the complex might have a previously undefined role in SUMO pathway homeostasis. Therefore, we assayed SUMO chain formation in Ufd1 mutants in vivo, using the foregoing GFP-SUMO foci reporter system (see Fig. 2A). Notably, ufd1-1 mutant cells, similar to slx8-29, also accumulated GFP-SUMO foci, although they were not as numerous or bright as those in slx8-29 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Double mutant slx8-29 ufd1-1 cells accumulated GFP-SUMO foci that were qualitatively similar to those in slx8-29 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, GFP-SUMO foci were not detected in an mts3-1 proteasome mutant (Fig. 4A). This indicates that when Slx8 or Ufd1 are still functional, they can counteract focal SUMO chain accumulation, independently of proteasomal activity. We extended our analysis to determine the effects of Ufd1 inactivation on total cellular SUMO conjugates, as detected by Western analysis. Compared with wild type, slx8-29 cells accumulated sumoylated species that were especially evident in the higher molecular weight range (Fig. 4C) (4Prudden J. Pebernard S. Raffa G. Slavin D.A.

Consistent with our GFP-SUMO foci data, ufd1-1 cells also accumulated higher molecular weight SUMO conjugates, albeit to a lesser degree, and ufd1-1 slx8-29 double mutants exhibited an increase in these conjugates over the slx8-29 single mutant, whereas the mts3-1 proteasome mutant predominantly accumulated medium molecular weight range SUMO conjugates, which were not prone to accumulate in visible nuclear foci (Fig."

This study compared diet-induced adipose tissue inflammation as well as functional properties of macrophages isolated from human APOE3 and APOE4 mice to identify the mechanism responsible for the association between apoE4 and inflammatory metabolic diseases. The initial study confirmed previous reports that APOE4 gene replacement mice were less sensitive than APOE3 mice to diet-induced body weight gain but exhibited hyperinsulinemia, and their adipose tissues were similarly inflamed as those in APOE3 mice. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from APOE4 mice were defective in efferocytosis compared with APOE3 macrophages. Increased cell death was also observed in APOE4 macrophages when stimulated with LPS or oxidized LDL. Western blot analysis of cell lysates revealed that APOE4 macrophages displayed elevated JNK phosphorylation indicative of cell stress even under basal culturing conditions. Significantly higher cell stress due mainly to potentiation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling was also observed in APOE4 macrophages after LPS and oxidized LDL activation. The defect in efferocytosis and elevated apoptosis sensitivity of APOE4 macrophages was ameliorated by treatment with the ER chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid. Taken together, these results showed that apoE4 expression causes macrophage dysfunction and promotes apoptosis via ER stress induction. The reduction of ER stress in macrophages may be a viable option to reduce inflammation and inflammation-related metabolic disorders associated with the apoE4 polymorphism."

O-GlcNAcylation is dynamically regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which are responsible for O-GlcNAc addition and removal, respectively. Although O-GlcNAcylation was found to play a significant role in several pathologies such as type II diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, the role of O-GlcNAcylation in the etiology and progression of cancer remains vague. Here, we followed O-GlcNAcylation and its catalytic machinery in metastatic clones of human colorectal cancer and the effect of OGA knockdown on cellular phenotype and on the transcriptome. The colorectal cancer SW620 metastatic clone exhibited increased O-GlcNAcylation and decreased OGA expression compared with its primary clone, SW480. O-GlcNAcylation elevation in SW620 cells, through RNA interference of OGA, resulted in phenotypic alterations that included acquisition of a fibroblast-like morphology, which coincides with epithelial metastatic progression and growth retardation. Microarray analysis revealed that OGA silencing altered the expression of about 1300 genes, mostly involved in cell movement and growth, and specifically affected metabolic pathways of lipids and carbohydrates. These findings support the involvement of O-GlcNAcylation in various aspects of tumor cell physiology and suggest that this modification may serve as a link between metabolic changes and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2073137883,"Cysteine synthesis is catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria of plants. Biochemical analyses of recombinant plant SAT and OAS-TL indicate that the reversible association of the proteins in the cysteine synthase complex (CSC) controls cellular sulfur homeostasis. However, the relevance of CSC formation in each compartment for flux control of cysteine synthesis remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between mitochondrial SAT3 and OAS-TL C in planta by FRET and establish the role of the mitochondrial CSC in the regulation of cysteine synthesis. NMR spectroscopy of isolated mitochondria from WT, serat2;2, and oastl-C plants showed the SAT-dependent export of OAS. The presence of cysteine resulted in reduced OAS export in mitochondria of oastl-C mutants but not in WT mitochondria. This is in agreement with the stronger in vitro feedback inhibition of free SAT by cysteine compared with CSC-bound SAT and explains the high OAS export rate of WT mitochondria in the presence of cysteine. The predominant role of mitochondrial OAS synthesis was validated in planta by feeding [(3)H]serine to the WT and loss-of-function mutants for OAS-TLs in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria. On the basis of these results, we propose a new model in which the mitochondrial CSC acts as a sensor that regulates the level of SAT activity in response to sulfur supply and cysteine demand."
https://openalex.org/W2025416981,"Most of our understanding of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation has been focused on the direct interaction between diffusible ligands and their seven-transmembrane domains. However, a number of these receptors depend on their extracellular N-terminal domain for ligand recognition and activation. To dissect the molecular interactions underlying both modes of activation at a single receptor, we used the unique properties of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), a GPCR that shows constitutive activity maintained by its N-terminal domain and is physiologically activated by the peptide α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH). We find that activation by the N-terminal domain and αMSH relies on different key residues in the transmembrane region. We also demonstrate that agouti-related protein, a physiological antagonist of MC4R, acts as an inverse agonist by inhibiting N terminus-mediated activation, leading to the speculation that a number of constitutively active orphan GPCRs could have physiological inverse agonists as sole regulators."

A number of multiresistant bacterial pathogens inactivate antibiotics by producing Zn(II)-dependent β-lactamases. We show that metal uptake leading to an active dinuclear enzyme in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria is ensured by a cysteine residue, an unusual metal ligand in oxidizing environments.

https://openalex.org/W1969299453,"Defects in stem cell renewal or progenitor cell expansion underlie ageing-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Yet much remains unclear about the mechanisms regulating progenitor expansion. Here we show that the tyrosine kinase c-Abl plays an important role in osteoprogenitor expansion. c-Abl interacts with and phosphorylates BMPRIA and the phosphorylation differentially influences the interaction of BMPRIA with BMPRII and the Tab1-Tak1 complex, leading to uneven activation of Smad1/5/8 and Erk1/2, the canonical and non-canonical BMP pathways that direct the expression of p16(INK4a). c-Abl deficiency shunts BMP signalling from Smad1/5/8 to Erk1/2, leading to p16(INK4a) upregulation and osteoblast senescence. Mouse genetic studies revealed that p16(INK4a) controls mesenchymal stem cell maintenance and osteoblast expansion and mediates the effects of c-Abl deficiency on osteoblast expansion and bone formation. These findings identify c-Abl as a regulator of BMP signalling pathways and uncover a role for c-Abl in p16(INK4a) expression and osteoprogenitor expansion."

Here, we elucidate the relationship between biochemistry and cellular host defense functions of mGBP2 in response to Toxoplasma gondii. The wild type protein exhibits low affinities to guanine nucleotides, self-assembles upon GTP binding, forming tetramers in the activated state, and stimulates the GTPase activity in a cooperative manner. The products of the two consecutive hydrolysis reactions are both GDP and GMP. The biochemical characterization of point mutants in the GTP-binding motifs of mGBP2 revealed amino acid residues that decrease the GTPase activity by orders of magnitude and strongly impair nucleotide binding and multimerization ability. Live cell imaging employing multiparameter fluorescence image spectroscopy (MFIS) using a Homo-FRET assay shows that the inducible multimerization of mGBP2 is dependent on a functional GTPase domain. The consistent results indicate that GTP binding, self-assembly, and stimulated hydrolysis activity are required for physiological localization of the protein in infected and uninfected cells. Ultimately, we show that the GTPase domain regulates efficient recruitment to T. gondii in response to IFN-γ."
https://openalex.org/W2107609525,"Regulated centrosome biogenesis is required for accurate cell division and for maintaining genome integrity. Centrosomes consist of a centriole pair surrounded by a protein network known as pericentriolar material (PCM). PCM assembly is a tightly regulated, critical step that determines the size and capability of centrosomes. Here, we report a role for tubulin in regulating PCM recruitment through the conserved centrosomal protein Sas-4. Tubulin directly binds to Sas-4; together they are components of cytoplasmic complexes of centrosomal proteins. A Sas-4 mutant, which cannot bind tubulin, enhances centrosomal protein complex formation and has abnormally large centrosomes with excessive activity. These results suggest that tubulin negatively regulates PCM recruitment. Whereas tubulin-GTP prevents Sas-4 from forming protein complexes, tubulin-GDP promotes it. Thus, the regulation of PCM recruitment by tubulin depends on its GTP/GDP-bound state. These results identify a role for tubulin in regulating PCM recruitment independent of its well-known role as a building block of microtubules. On the basis of its guanine-bound state, tubulin can act as a molecular switch in PCM recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2036671635,"The diffusible messenger NO plays multiple roles in neuroprotection, neurodegeneration, and brain plasticity. Argininosuccinate synthase (AS) is a ubiquitous enzyme in mammals and the key enzyme of the NO-citrulline cycle, because it provides the substrate L-arginine for subsequent NO synthesis by inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NO synthase (NOS). Here, we provide evidence for the participation of AS and of the NO-citrulline cycle in the progress of differentiation of neural stem cells (NSC) into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. AS expression and activity and neuronal NOS expression, as well as l-arginine and NO(x) production, increased along neural differentiation, whereas endothelial NOS expression was augmented in conditions of chronic NOS inhibition during differentiation, indicating that this NOS isoform is amenable to modulation by extracellular cues. AS and NOS inhibition caused a delay in the progress of neural differentiation, as suggested by the decreased percentage of terminally differentiated cells. On the other hand, BDNF reversed the delay of neural differentiation of NSC caused by inhibition of NO(x) production. A likely cause is the lack of NO, which up-regulated p75 neurotrophin receptor expression, a receptor required for BDNF-induced differentiation of NSC. We conclude that the NO-citrulline cycle acts together with BDNF for maintaining the progress of neural differentiation."

Peptide P3 (FPGVPLDTHDVFQYREKAYFC), a sequence present in B4 or smaller versions of this sequence (peptides P3a/P3b), inhibited B-CLL cell adhesion to GST-PEX9 or proMMP-9, with IC50 values of 138 and 279 μm, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1985191844,"FAS-associated factor 1 (FAF1) antagonizes Wnt signaling by stimulating β-catenin degradation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) is required for FAF1 to suppress Wnt signaling and that FAF1 specifically associates with the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein)-β-TrCP complex. Depletion of β-TrCP reduced FAF1-mediated β-catenin polyubiquitination and impaired FAF1 in antagonizing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. FAF1 was shown to act as a scaffold for β-catenin and β-TrCP and thereby to potentiate β-TrCP-mediated β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation. Data mining revealed that FAF1 expression is statistically down-regulated in human breast carcinoma compared with normal breast tissue. Consistent with this, FAF1 expression is higher in epithelial-like MCF7 than mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Depletion of FAF1 in MCF7 cells resulted in increased β-catenin accumulation and signaling. Importantly, FAF1 knockdown promoted a decrease in epithelial E-cadherin and an increase in mesenchymal vimentin expression, indicative for an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ectopic FAF1 expression reduces breast cancer cell migration in vitro and invasion/metastasis in vivo. Thus, our studies strengthen a tumor-suppressive function for FAF1."
https://openalex.org/W1987662136,"LmrP is a major facilitator superfamily multidrug transporter from Lactococcus lactis that mediates the efflux of cationic amphiphilic substrates from the cell in a proton-motive force-dependent fashion. Interestingly, motif searches and docking studies suggested the presence of a putative Ca(2+)-binding site close to the interface between the two halves of inward facing LmrP. Binding experiments with radioactive (45)Ca(2+) demonstrated the presence of a high affinity Ca(2+)-binding site in purified LmrP, with an apparent K(d) of 7.2 μm, which is selective for Ca(2+) and Ba(2+) but not for Mn(2+), Mg(2+), or Co(2+). Consistent with our structure model and analogous to crystal structures of EF hand Ca(2+)-binding proteins, two carboxylates (Asp-235 and Glu-327) were found to be critical for (45)Ca(2+) binding. Using (45)Ca(2+) and a fluorescent Ca(2+)-selective probe, calcium transport measurements in intact cells, inside-out membrane vesicles, and proteoliposomes containing functionally reconstituted purified protein provided strong evidence for active efflux of Ca(2+) by LmrP with an apparent K(t) of 8.6 μm via electrogenic exchange with three or more protons. These observations demonstrate for the first time that LmrP mediates selective calcium/proton antiport and raise interesting questions about the functional and physiological links between this reaction and that of multidrug transport."

Studies of individual cathepsins hydrolyzing elastin or collagen have provided insight into their binding and kinetics, but cooperative or synergistic activity between cathepsins K and S is less described. Using fluorogenic substrate assays, Western blotting, cathepsin zymography, and computational analyses, we uncovered cathepsin cannibalism, a novel mechanism by which cathepsins degrade each other as well as the substrate, with cathepsin S predominantly degrading cathepsin K. As a consequence of these proteolytic interactions, a reduction in total hydrolysis of elastin and type I collagen was measured compared with computationally predicted values derived from individual cathepsin assays. Furthermore, type I collagen was preserved from hydrolysis when a 10-fold ratio of cathepsin S cannibalized the highly collagenolytic cathepsin K, preventing its activity. Elastin was not preserved due to strong elastinolytic ability of both enzymes. Together, these results provide new insight into the combined proteolytic activities of cathepsins toward substrates and each other and present kinetic models to consider for more accurate predictions and descriptions of these systems.

Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), each protease has its own unique properties. Cathepsin K is the most potent mammalian collagenase, capable of cleaving collagens I and II both intrahelically and at the telopeptide regions (9Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M.

Cathepsin S is noteworthy for its elastase activity and maintaining its proteolytic activity at neutral pH, making it unique among the cathepsins, which generally prefer acidic environments (13Liu J.

Cathepsin activity is regulated by many factors in the surrounding microenvironment, with major influences, including temperature, pH, and oxidative potential (15Novinec M. Kovacic L. Lenarcic B.

The binding affinities and hydrolytic rates for ECM components vary by cathepsin. Taken together, in vivo, cathepsins exist as a system of relatively short-lived enzymes working simultaneously on multiple substrates, both intra- and extracellularly, making it difficult to separate and distinguish the activity of an individual cathepsin experimentally (17Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. A comparison of four cathepsins (B, L, N, and S) with collagenolytic activity from rabbit spleen.Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Computational models of proteolytic activity have provided significant insight into the kinetics of these enzymes' proteolytic activity in varied microenvironments and even suggested cathepsin adsorption to soluble and insoluble elastins as a mechanism to stabilize and extend cathepsin K, L, and S half-lives and activity (18Novinec M. Grass R.N. Stark W.J. Turk V. Baici A. Lenarcic B. Interaction between human cathepsins K, L, and S and elastins: mechanism of elastinolysis and inhibition by macromolecular inhibitors.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7893-7902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This insight was obtained from observations of individual cathepsins hydrolyzing elastin, but in tissue-degradative diseases such as atherosclerosis, where elastin is a primary ECM-remodeling target, macrophages and smooth muscle cells in the developing plaque region secrete a combination of different cathepsins into the extracellular space. Cooperative or synergistic activity between cathepsins K and S during degradation of elastin and collagen, two dominant structural ECM proteins in the arterial wall, has not been studied but belies a potential mechanism for additional regulation of cathepsin regulation further complicated by the different affinities and rates of catalysis of cathepsins K and S for elastin and collagen. Computational modeling provides the ability to probe for such interactive proteolysis, allowing us to separately parse cathepsin K and S activity in extracellular environments where they are both present and degrading ECM. Here, we take a step toward understanding the combined proteolytic activity of cathepsins K and S for elastin and type I collagen using experimental and computational approaches. Through these studies, we uncovered unexpected proteolysis of cathepsin S cleaving cathepsin K, termed here cathepsin cannibalism, which reduced the total elastin- and collagen-degradative activity in the multiple cathepsin system. We further show the physiological implications of these interactions for regulating ECM proteolysis; cathepsin cannibalism protects type I collagen through a reduction in the amount of highly collagenolytic cathepsin K available due to cathepsin S degradation of cathepsin K. Five pmol of recombinant human cathepsin K from NSO cells (Enzo) or recombinant human cathepsin S from insect cells (Enzo) was incubated with 50 μg/ml DQ elastin (Invitrogen) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Brij 35 for defined time periods in a 96-well plate, and hydrolytic activity was determined by an increase in fluorescence measured at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 525 nm with a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices). A no-enzyme control was used to subtract background fluorescence. Five pmol of cathepsin K or S was incubated with 50 μg/ml soluble elastin (Elastin Products), VGVAPG peptides (Elastin Products), VAPG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich), or 500 μg/ml rat tail type I collagen (R&D Systems) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA for defined time periods. Laemmli buffer with or without β-mercaptoethanol was added to prepare samples for SDS-PAGE/Western blotting or cathepsin zymography, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and were imaged after destaining with an ImageQuant LAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare). All recombinant cathepsins are from human sequences and were purchased in mature forms. SDS-PAGE was performed on aliquots of cathepsin samples prepared as described above. Protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with monoclonal anti-cathepsin K antibody clone 182-12G5 (Millipore) and anti-cathepsin S antibodies (R&D Biosystems). Donkey anti-mouse or anti-goat secondary antibodies tagged with an infrared fluorophore (Rockland Immunochemicals) were used to image protein with a LI-COR Odyssey scanner. Computational models of cathepsin-mediated proteolysis of ECM proteins were built using the MATLAB SimBiology suite (MathWorks). These models were constructed using mass action kinetics describing cathepsin binding and hydrolysis of substrates. Initial models assumed one enzyme binding to one substrate with associated on (kon) and off (koff) rates and then catalysis of the substrate to form product and free enzyme at some rate (kcat). Enzyme inactivation, whether by denaturation, degradation, or some other means, was lumped into the rate parameter kinact. All reaction equations are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Substrate proteolysis model with cathepsin cannibalism-governing equationsCathepsin K inactivationcatK→kinact KcatKdCathepsin S inactivationcatS→kinact ScatSdCathepsin cannibalismcatS+catK⇌koff1kon1(catS*catK)→kcat1catS+degraded catKProteolysis by cathepsin KcatK+substrate⇌koff2kon2(catK*substrate)→kcat2catK+productsProteolysis by cathepsin ScatS+substrate⇌koff3kon3(catS*substrate)→kcat3catS+products Open table in a new tab Initial guesses for the rate constants were from literature values, and then the parameters were fit to experimental data using a nonlinear minimum search algorithm in MATLAB by minimizing the difference between observed and predicted product formation. Fluorescent elastin product was used to construct elastin models. For collagenolysis simulations, collagen remaining following substrate degradation assays was determined via densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and used to fit collagen rate parameters. Parameter estimation for the elastin model consisted of two phases; the first parameters elucidated were the binding and catalysis rates (kon, koff, and kcat). These kinetic rates were derived using only the early time points of the fluorescent elastase hydrolysis curves, where product formation was approximately linear and inactivation of the enzymes was assumed to be minimal. Inactivation rates for the enzymes (kinact) were subsequently fit using the same algorithm inclusive of the entire time span of enzyme activity. Collagenolysis models required fitting parameters across different cathepsin S:K ratios. To do so, models were constructed for each cathepsin S:K ratio data point with identical rate parameters while the concentration of cathepsin S was varied. The rate constants were then determined by minimizing the difference between the predicted and observed collagen remaining. This protocol is based on our previously published protocol (19Wilder C.L. Park K.Y. Keegan P.M. Platt M.O. Manipulating substrate and pH in zymography protocols selectively distinguishes cathepsins K, L, S, and V activity in cells and tissues.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 516: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nonreducing loading buffer (5× 0.05% bromphenol blue, 10% SDS, 1.5 m Tris, and 50% glycerol) was added to all samples prior to loading. Protein was resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.2% gelatin at 4 °C. Gels were removed, and enzymes were renatured in 65 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) with 20% glycerol for three washes of 10 min each. Gels were then incubated in activity buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT freshly added) for 30 min at room temperature. This activity buffer was exchanged for fresh activity buffer of the same pH, and incubation was continued for 18–24 h (overnight) at 37 °C. The gels were rinsed once with deionized water and incubated for 1 h in Coomassie Blue stain (10% acetic acid, 25% isopropyl alcohol, and 4.5% Coomassie Blue), followed by destaining (10% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid). Gels were imaged using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 system. Mechanisms behind cathepsin inactivation have been cited as due to oxidation, pH, denaturation, and other mechanisms (16Godat E.

The half-life of human procathepsin S.Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but kinetics of autodigestion have been less well described. Cathepsins K and S are both strong elastases implicated in proteolyzing elastic lamina in vascular structures (8Chapman H.A. Riese R.J. Shi G.P. Emerging roles for cysteine proteases in human biology.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), and to gain insight into how the enzymes' loss of activity via inactivation or degradation affects substrate hydrolysis, five pmol of each enzyme were incubated separately with 50 μg/ml DQ elastin, a fluorogenic elastin substrate that releases fluorescence after proteolytic cleavage. Fluorescence was assayed for up to 3 h to measure elastinolysis (Fig. 1A). For cathepsins K (white triangles) and S (white squares), product formation, measured as increased fluorescence, slowed significantly by 1 h. Kinetic parameters for each cathepsin were determined from these data, and a computational model of cathepsin K and S elastase activity was developed to predict their combined elastase activity and is shown by the solid red line. To experimentally determine whether these two proteases work synergistically to degrade elastin, as may be seen in macrophages that secrete both cathepsins K and S into the extracellular space, 5 pmol of each cathepsins K and S were co-incubated with fluorogenic elastin. Elastinolysis measured experimentally (red circles) was substantially less than computationally predicted values (red line). We confirmed that these assays were in the linear fluorescence range by testing increasing concentrations of the fluorogenic elastin substrate from 1 to 100 μg/ml (supplemental Fig. 1); additionally, the maximum potential fluorescence was not reached, as pancreatic elastase incubated with the same concentrations of DQ elastin generated five times the fluorescence signal (data not shown). Western blotting for cathepsins K and S was performed after co-incubation with soluble elastin for defined time periods to determine whether proteolytic degradation reduced the observed overall elastase activity. Immunodetected bands of cathepsin K disappeared as quickly as 30 min when co-incubated with cathepsin S compared with 60 min when incubated alone (Fig. 1B). This additional degradation could be blocked by the addition of E-64, a small molecule cathepsin inhibitor, suggesting proteolytic cleavage. This appeared to be due to cathepsin S hydrolysis of cathepsin K because the cathepsin S protein band was not diminished during co-incubation. We termed this cathepsin cannibalism, a mechanism by which one enzyme proteolyzes its own family member. To develop this hypothesis of cannibalistic interactions, cannibalism reaction terms were introduced for cathepsin S degrading cathepsin K in the elastin co-incubation model. In this new model, we assumed that cathepsin S binds to cathepsin K in a catalytically productive manner to form an enzyme-enzyme complex. The cathepsin K can then be cleaved into degradation products, and free cathepsin S is returned to the system, effectively treating cathepsin K as an additional substrate for cathepsin S with unique affinities and catalytic rates (Table 1). This new model was able to recapitulate the experimental data for the co-incubated cathepsins (Fig. 1C, red line) and revealed that reductions in total elastinolytic activity were due to proteolysis of mature active cathepsin K in the combined system. Using this newly defined cathepsin cannibalism model to calculate the separate contributions of cathepsins K and S to total elastinolytic activity, the fraction due to cathepsin K decreased from 94% to just 59% of the total. To determine which elastin fragments are involved in cathepsin K degradation, we incubated 1 pmol of cathepsin K with 50 μg/ml soluble elastin, VGVAPG elastin fragment, VAPG elastin fragment, or no substrate for 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min; a 120-min reaction was also incubated with E-64 to inhibit cathepsin K proteolytic activity. Reactions were terminated by the addition of reducing Laemmli buffer, and samples prepared were for Western blotting with anti-cathepsin K antibodies. The results are shown in Fig. 1D. As expected, the immunodetectable cathepsin K disappeared faster in the presence of soluble elastin compared with controls. The VGVAPG fragment of elastin has been implicated in a number of studies since first being identified as an important chemotactic fragment (21Senior R.M. Griffin G.L. Mecham R.P. Wrenn D.S. Prasad K.U. Urry D.W. Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly, a repeating peptide in elastin, is chemotactic for fibroblasts and monocytes.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and, when incubated with cathepsin K, slowed the loss of immunodetectable cathepsin K. However, incubation with the VAPG motifs, missing the initial VG amino acids, showed the greatest reduction in loss of cathepsin K as indicated by the sustained band intensity (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that there are several motifs in the full-length elastin monomers that contribute to cathepsin K degradation (e.g. VGVAPG), but that the VG repeats may be most important in mediating this cathepsin K degradation in the presence of elastin, as the VAPG fragment alone minimizes the loss of cathepsin K. Both cathepsins K and S cleave elastin, albeit with different affinities and catalytic rates, but only cathepsin K cleaves triple helical type I and II collagens (9Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M. Drake F.H. McQueney M.S. Foged N.T. Delmas P.D. Delaissé J.M. The collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K is unique among mammalian proteinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32347-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To determine whether cathepsin cannibalism is unique to elastin or occurs while degrading other ECM substrates, cathepsins K and S were incubated either separately or together with 500 μg/ml type I collagen for increasing time periods up to 2 h. E-64 was also incubated with samples for 2 h to inhibit cathepsin proteolytic activity. Laemmli buffer was added to stop the reactions, and samples were loaded for SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining to monitor collagen hydrolysis as described (22Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. Collagenase activity of cathepsin K depends on complex formation with chondroitin sulfate.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cathepsin K effectively degraded type I collagen as indicated by reduced Coomassie Blue staining at 150 kDa, but cathepsin S did not (Fig. 2A). Western blotting was performed to probe for cathepsin K protein remaining at each time point. Cathepsin K protein was stabilized in the presence of type I collagen over this 2-h period compared with its degradation in the presence of elastin (Fig. 1B); however, when co-incubated with cathepsin S, immunodetectable cathepsin K decreased with time, suggesting that cannibalism was occurring on collagen as well (Fig. 2B). Densitometry of the cathepsin K immunoblots is summarized in Fig. 2C, indicating that loss of cathepsin K was minimized on collagen compared with elastin, but cannibalism by cathepsin S still occurred during co-incubation and could reduce the amount of cathepsin K protein present. With the cathepsin S low hydrolytic activity of collagen I, we hypothesized that at some ratiometric amount of cathepsin S to K, cannibalism of cathepsin K in a collagen-rich environment could serve to reduce collagen degradation, thereby preserving it. To test this hypothesis, cathepsin K (1 pmol) was incubated with increasing ratiometric amounts of cathepsin S (0.001-, 0.01-, 0.1-, 1-, and 10-fold) and 500 μg/ml type I collagen for 1 h. The resultant proteolysis and residual cathepsin activity were analyzed by Western blotting, SDS-PAGE, and cathepsin zymography (Fig. 3). Cathepsin K protein was visibly reduced at a 10-fold ratio of cathepsin S:K, coincident with type I collagen preservation in Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Collagen was also preserved when E-64 was added. Multiplex cathepsin zymography is an assay that visualizes active mature cathepsins S and K and distinguishes them by their unique electrophoretic migration distances; samples of the ratiometric incubations prepared for zymography revealed that the most intense cathepsin S cleared bands were seen in the same lane as the decreased cathepsin K cleared bands of activity at a 10-fold ratio. This indicated a decrease in cathepsin K activity remaining at the 10-fold cathepsin S:K ratio (Fig. 3D). Using kinetic parameters derived from the previous experiments, we developed computational models of cathepsin S cannibalism of cathepsin K during collagen degradation. The predicted and observed values for collagen remaining after a 1-h incubation period are shown in Fig. 4A. From this, we were able to extrapolate a time course of collagen degradation, with the arrow in Fig. 4B indicating increasing collagen preservation as the initial cathepsin S:K ratio was increased. If the collagen I preservation effect of cathepsin cannibalism resulted from the low catalytic efficiency of cathepsin S for the substrate, then substrate preservation might not occur on elastin, a substrate that both cathepsins K and S readily proteolyze. To test this, the cathepsin cannibalism model of elastin co-incubation detailed in Fig. 1C was used to predict the effects of increased cathepsin S:K ratios on elastin substrate hydrolysis. Predictions for total elastin remaining following a 1-h co-incubation with an increasing cathepsin S:K ratio are shown in Fig. 4C. Contrary to the collagen I degradation model, more elastin degradation products were formed with increasing ratiometric amounts of cathepsin S, and there was no elastin preservation effect (Fig. 4D). There is a dearth of information on the interactive degradation that will occur if cathepsins are simultaneously secreted to work on the same ECM protein substrates, as has been shown in atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, tumor metastasis, and other tissue-destructive disease microenvironments. There has been an implicit assumption of enzyme inertness, which presupposes that there are negligible degradative interactions between proteases and assumes that each cathepsin focuses solely on hydrolyzing the substrate. We show here that cathepsin interactive proteolysis of each other negates this assumption. We have termed this phenomenon cathepsin cannibalism, where cathepsin S degrades cathepsin K and, in the presence of ECM substrate proteins, can result in a reduction of total substrate proteolysis. Both cathepsins K and S are strong elastases, but their collagenolytic activity differs significantly: cathepsin K readily cleaves type I collagen both intrahelically and in the telopeptide regions, a unique feature among mammalian collagenases (9Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M. Drake F.H. McQueney M.S. Foged N.T. Delmas P.D. Delaissé J.M. The collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K is unique among mammalian proteinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32347-32352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Improved cathepsin K stability in the presence of type I collagen may be an important factor to consider in the context of remodeling diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis, where collagen I is excessively degraded, and cellular expression of cathepsin K is pathologically increased (23Hou W.S. Li W. Keyszer G. Weber E. Levy R. Klein M.J. Gravallese E.M. Goldring S.R. Brömme D. Comparison of cathepsin K and S expression within the rheumatoid and osteoarthritic synovium.Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Lecaille F. Brömme D. Lalmanach G. Biochemical properties and regulation of cathepsin K activity.Biochimie. 2008; 90: 208-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cathepsin S has a much lower binding affinity and catalytic rate for collagen I and cleaves only at the telopeptide regions of the molecule, regions that are increasingly exposed after hydrolysis by cathepsin K. However, the affinity for and catalysis of cathepsin K by cathepsin S were found to be preferential over its collagenolytic activity in this study. In an environment rich with type I collagen and excess cathepsin K such as osteoporotic bone, cathepsin S cleavage of cathepsin K may actually preserve the collagen by degrading the cathepsin K present and potentially help maintain the bone structure and biomechanics. This mechanism of protease “inhibition” is a novel way in which these enzymes may be working against each other in tissue remodeling and potentially diseased environments. It is the non-intuitive and unexpected activity of these enzymes that has been difficult to monitor in vitro and especially challenging in vivo. Although the bulk contribution of this cathepsin family to overall matrix proteolysis can be measured with E-64 inhibition, it is considerably more difficult to parse out the individual roles of each cathepsin.

Toward this goal, we have been able to develop computational models that incorporate cannibalistic reactions of these two cathepsins as they work to hydrolyze elastin or collagen substrates (Fig. 5). This final model details the kinetic reactions occurring simultaneously in these microenvironments. In reactions i and ii, cathepsins K and S are subject to denaturation by still as yet ill defined mechanisms but which probably include autodigestion, denaturation, or inactivation. In reaction iii, cathepsin K is subject to cannibalism by cathepsin S to produce degraded cathepsin K, but while it is mature and active (reaction iv), cathepsin K is capable of binding to triple helical collagen and catalyzing its degradation. In reaction v, active cathepsin S can bind to collagen I, but there is scarce proteolysis. These reactions were used to construct the SimBiology model incorporating the interactions between cathepsins K and S during their co-incubation with ECM substrates and were solved simultaneously as depicted by the schematic in Fig. 5B. The expansible model framework created here can be extended to predict hydrolytic activity in numerous microenvironments such as ECM degradation by multiple cell types secreting many proteases as seen in tumor environments. As the activity of the individual enzymes alone may not be sufficient to fully explain bulk proteolysis, such a model may lead to a better understanding of how these enzymes work in concert and against each other while generating novel hypotheses to describe proteolytic behavior in vivo under a variety of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2025249788,"Phosphatase plays a crucial role in determining cellular fate by inactivating its substrate kinase, but it is not known whether a kinase can vice versa phosphorylate its phosphatase to execute this function. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1) is a specific phosphatase of p38γ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through PDZ binding, and here, we show that p38γ is also a PTPH1 kinase through which it executes its oncogenic activity and regulates stress response. PTPH1 was identified as a substrate of p38γ by unbiased proteomic analysis, and its resultant phosphorylation at Ser-459 occurs in vitro and in vivo through their complex formation. Genetic and pharmacological analyses showed further that Ser-459 phosphorylation is directly regulated by Ras signaling and is important for Ras, p38γ, and PTPH1 oncogenic activity. Moreover, experiments with physiological stimuli revealed a novel stress pathway from p38γ to PTPH1/Ser-459 phosphorylation in regulating cell growth and cell death by a mechanism dependent on cellular environments but independent of canonical MAPK activities. These results thus reveal a new mechanism by which a MAPK regulates Ras oncogenesis and stress response through directly phosphorylating its phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2054544867,"The regulation of mesenchymal cell growth by signaling molecules plays an important role in maintaining tissue functions. Aberrant mesenchymal cell proliferation caused by disruption of this regulatory process leads to pathogenetic events such as fibrosis. In the current study we have identified a novel nuclear factor, Phf14, which controls the proliferation of mesenchymal cells by regulating PDGFRα expression. Phf14-null mice died just after birth due to respiratory failure. Histological analyses of the lungs of these mice showed interstitial hyperplasia with an increased number of PDGFRα(+) mesenchymal cells. PDGFRα expression was elevated in Phf14-null mesenchymal fibroblasts, resulting in increased proliferation. We demonstrated that Phf14 acts as a transcription factor that directly represses PDGFRα expression. Based on these results, we used an antibody against PDGFRα to successfully treat mouse lung fibrosis. This study shows that Phf14 acts as a negative regulator of PDGFRα expression in mesenchymal cells undergoing normal and abnormal proliferation, and is a potential target for new treatments of lung fibrosis."

Selenium is an essential trace element that has been associated with cancer for more than a century. Nevertheless, there remains considerable uncertainty whether selenium protects against cancer or actually promotes cancer development. There is also no consensus regarding the relative importance of selenoproteins and small molecular weight selenium compounds in mediating selenium effects. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which selenium affects processes involved in carcinogenesis. Selenoprotein W (SEPW1) is a highly conserved 9-kDa thioredoxin-like selenocysteine protein with homologues in all major phyla except higher plants and fungi. SEPW1 is ubiquitous and is one of the most highly expressed selenoproteins in humans. Our previous work showed SEPW1 is required for cell cycle progression in human breast and prostate epithelial cells and SEPW1 mRNA levels oscillate with the cell cycle (1Hawkes W.C. Wang T.T. Alkan Z. Richter B.D. Dawson K. Selenoprotein W modulates control of cell cycle entry.Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 2009; 131: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We further found that delayed G1- to S-phase progression from SEPW1 depletion is mediated by p53 and p21 and is associated with phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-33 (2Hawkes W.C. Alkan Z.

Because the G1- to S-phase transition is a critical point of dysfunction in cancer cells, it is important to understand the role of SEPW1 in regulating G1- to S-phase progression. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPmitogen-activated proteinMKK4mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4MAP3KMAP kinase kinase kinaseMAP2KMAP kinase kinaseLSDleast significant difference. kinases (MAPKs) are proline-directed, serine-threonine kinases that constitute the backbone of the extracellular receptor signal transduction system in mammalian cells. MAP kinases transduce various extracellular signals and stresses through signaling cascades composed of three (or more) protein kinases that phosphorylate and activate each other sequentially. MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) receive inputs from cell surface receptors and subsequently activate MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), which activate the MAP kinases. Currently at least 14 MAP3Ks, 7 MAP2Ks, and 12 MAPKs have been identified in mammalian cells. There are three families of closely related MAP kinases: the extracellular-receptor kinases (ERKs) that include ERK1, ERK2, ERK3/ERK4, and ERK5 and two families that respond to cellular stress and inflammatory signals, the so-called “stress-activated” MAP kinases; the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) that include JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3; p38 MAP kinases p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. Upon activation, MAPKs phosphorylate other protein kinases and transcription factors that control a wide variety of cellular processes involved with proliferation, differentiation, development, cell division, apoptosis, cell motility, and survival. MAP kinases play a prominent role in controlling the phosphorylation and thus activation of p53 (4Wu G.S. The functional interactions between the p53 and MAPK signaling pathways.Cancer Biol.

MKK4 is phosphorylated and thus activated by the MAP3Ks: ASK1, MEKK1, MEKK4, TAK1, TPL2, and by the mixed-lineage kinase MLK3 (5Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

We screened MAP kinase pathways using siRNA to identify events upstream of p53 in the pathway controlling cell cycle arrest from SEPW1 silencing. We found evidence suggesting SEPW1 depletion increases MKK4, which activates p38γ, p38δ, and JNK2 to phosphorylate p53 on Ser-33 and cause a transient G1 arrest. RWPE-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in KSFM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract and 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% humidified air, 5%CO2. 105 cells per well were reverse-transfected for 24 h in 6-well dishes with 0.2% Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Invitrogen) and 5 nm Silencer Select siRNAs (ABI, Foster City, CA) targeting SEPW1 (s361, s363), JNK1 (s11152, s11153), JNK2 (s229708, s11159), JNK3 (s11161, s11163), p38α (s3585, s3586), p38β (s11155, s11157), p38γ (s12468, s12467), p38δ (s11165, 11166), MKK3 (s11173, s11175), MKK4 (s12701, s12703), MKK6 (s11180, s11181), MKK7 (s11182, s11183), MEKK1 (s8668), MEKK4 (s8675), ASK1 (s8676), TAK1 (s13767), TPL2 (s3383), MLK3 (s8670) or Silencer Select negative control siRNA #1. Transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium the next day, and cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection. Silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were assessed with Western blots (supplemental Figs. S1–S5). Unless stated otherwise, data identified only as “SEPW1 siRNA” refers to siRNA s361. Cells were fixed using 70% ethanol in PBS, washed with PBS, and then stained with a solution of propidium iodide, Triton X-100, and RNase A in PBS. At least 20,000 events per sample were collected on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was conducted with ModFit LT 3.0 software (Verity Software, Topsham, ME). Singlets were manually gated on a FL-2 width versus FL-2 area plot, and cell cycle phase percentages were calculated by the software using the diploid model. Representative pseudo-color density plots of events with each siRNA treatment are provided (supplemental Figs. S6–S8). Western blots were obtained as described before (3Hawkes W.C. Printsev I.

Densitometry was performed with ImageLab software (Bio-Rad), and chemiluminescence of protein bands was normalized to the average chemiluminescence of the immunoblot before statistical analysis. Three days after siRNA transfection, cells grown on coverslips were fixed using 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 0.2% gelatin, incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-p53 antibodies followed by 5 μg/ml Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma), all diluted in PBS. Coverslips were mounted using SlowFade anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen), and images were collected on an Axiovert 40 CFL microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Spot RT3 camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) at equal exposure times. Cells were grown in medium containing 60 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) to inhibit protein synthesis, and lysates were collected at several time points up to 24 h. The amount of MKK4 protein at each time point was estimated from Western blots. Cell cycle phase distributions and Western blot densitometry measurements from different siRNA treatments were compared using two-way analysis of variance or paired t tests with SigmaStat 2.03 (Systat, San Jose, CA) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) software. Unless stated otherwise, estimates of experimental variability are expressed as S.E. For data sets including several independent experiments, S.E. were calculated from pooled standard deviations (12Taylor J.K. Quality Assurance of Chemical Measurements. Lewis Publishers, Chelsea, MI1987: 24Google Scholar). Between-group comparisons were analyzed with Tukey's test for cell cycle data or with Fisher's LSD test for quantitative densitometry data. A probability of <0.05 was considered significant. Because Ser-33 phosphorylation is associated with G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing and Ser-33 is known to be phosphorylated by JNK and p38 (13Hu M.C.

Silencing expression of SEPW1 alone caused RWPE-1 cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, indicative of a transient G1-phase arrest (Table 1). Silencing p38γ, p38δ, or JNK2 in SEPW1-depleted cells inhibited the increase in the G0/G1 fraction by 33, 63, or 60%, respectively (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's test). Silencing p38α or JNK1 partially rescued the G1 arrest in some experiments but did not reach statistical significance, suggesting they may also have some role in this pathway. On the other hand, silencing p38β or JNK3 did not appear to have an effect in any experiment, suggesting these MAP kinases are not involved.TABLE 1Effect of silencing MAP kinase isoforms on delayed G1 to S-phase progression due to SEPW1 depletionsiRNA treatmentPercentage of cells (±S.E.)G0 and G1S phaseG2 and MNo transfection61.9 ± 0.230.2 ± 0.37.9 ± 0.2Non-targeting control siRNA63.4 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.28.7 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.7.9 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.SEPW1 siRNA74.6 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.20.2 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.2 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.p38α siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA72.8 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.21.1 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.6.1 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.p38β siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA75.1 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.20.5 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.3 ± 0.1bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.p38γ siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA70.9 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.23.5 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.6 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.p38δ siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA67.5 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.25.6 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.6.9 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.JNK1 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA78.5 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.16.0 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.5 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.JNK2 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA67.9 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.26.4 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.5.7 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.JNK3 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA76.1 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.19.1 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.8 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.a Significantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.b Significantly different from non-targeting control siRNA. Open table in a new tab Because G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing was rescued by silencing p38γ, p38δ, or JNK2, we tested if silencing p38γ, p38δ, or JNK2 also reversed Ser-33 phosphorylation. Each MAPK was silenced with two different siRNA sequences, and the data were pooled to calculate the mean Ser(P)-33-p53 resulting from silencing each MAPK. Silencing p38γ, p38δ, or JNK2 significantly decreased Ser(P)-33-p53 (p < 0.05, n = 3, two-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD test, Fig. 1), suggesting that p38γ, p38δ, and JNK2 are involved in phosphorylating Ser-33 in SEPW1-depleted cells. Because both JNK and p38 seemed to be involved in G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing, we focused our search for upstream signaling components on the four MAP2Ks known to activate both pathways: MKK3, MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7. When expression of MKK3, MKK6, or MKK7 was silenced, the G1 arrest from SEPW1 depletion was not rescued (Table 2). In contrast, silencing MKK4 completely rescued G1 arrest from SEPW1 depletion, showing that MKK4 is required for transmitting the signal leading to G1 arrest. This is consistent with the role of MKK4 in inhibiting G1- to S-phase progression during senescence (11Cunningham S.C. Gallmeier E. Kern S.E. MKK4 as oncogene or tumor suppressor.

Cancer. 2012; 130: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To ensure that rescue by MKK4 siRNA was not due to off-target effects, we confirmed the results with two SEPW1 siRNAs and two MKK4 siRNAs, tested in all four combinations (Table 3). Both SEPW1 siRNAs caused a statistically significant accumulation of cells in G0/G1-phase, and both MKK4 siRNAs rescued the delay in cell cycle progression induced by either of the two SEPW1 siRNAs (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's test, Table 3). Thus, the rescue did not depend on the sequence of the siRNAs or on which SEPW1 siRNA was tested with which MKK4 siRNA.TABLE 2Effect of MAP2K silencing on delayed G1 to S-phase progression due to SEPW1 depletionsiRNA treatmentPercentage of cells (±S.E.)G0 and G1S phaseG2 and MNo transfection58.0 ± 0.734.3 ± 1.07.7 ± 0.3Non-targeting control siRNA63.7 ± 0.3aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.29.9 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.6.4 ± 0.2SEPW1 siRNA s36176.3 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.18.7 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.9 ± 0.1MKK3 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA80.5 ± 0.1aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.14.0 ± 0.1aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.5 ± 0.1MKK4 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNAcThe experiment was repeated six times.62.6 ± 0.9aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.29.0 ± 1.0aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.8.3 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.MKK6 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA74.4 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.21.2 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.4 ± 0.2MKK7 siRNA and SEPW1 siRNA74.0 ± 0.3bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.18.8 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.7.2 ± 0.5aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.a Significantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.b Significantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.c The experiment was repeated six times.

Open table in a new tab Silencing SEPW1 with either of two siRNAs caused marked increases in Ser(P)-33-p53 (Fig. 2). When MKK4 was also silenced with either of two different siRNAs, the increases in Ser(P)-33-p53 were largely blocked (p < 0.05, n = 2, two-way ANOVA with Fisher's LSD test), confirming MKK4 is upstream of p53 in the pathway leading to G1 arrest. Activation of p53 is a complex function of numerous post-translational modifications culminating in accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, a necessary step before p53 can act as a transcription factor. Therefore, nuclear accumulation is an integrated measure of p53 activation that reflects the net effect of many different modes of regulation (15O'Brate A. Giannakakou P. The importance of p53 location. Nuclear or cytoplasmic zip code?.Drug Resist. Updat. 2003; 6: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Silencing SEPW1 caused a large shift in the subcellular distribution of p53 (Fig. 3), increasing the fraction of cells with nuclei stained positive for p53 from 4 to 85% (p < 0.0001, χ2 test). Simultaneous silencing of MKK4 substantially prevented nuclear accumulation of p53 in response to SEPW1 depletion. Thus, MKK4 expression is required for activation and nuclear accumulation of p53 when SEPW1 is silenced.FIGURE 3Effect of silencing SEPW1 and MKK4 on nuclear accumulation of p53. Seventy-two hours after transfection with a single siRNA targeting SEPW1, with two siRNAs targeting SEPW1 and MKK4, or a non-targeting control siRNA, RWPE-1 cells grown on coverslips were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies for total p53 followed by Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with DAPI and is displayed as a false green color to allow coincidence with p53 to show as yellow. p53 micrographs were collected at equal exposure times, and contrast and brightness were adjusted identically in all images. At least 100 cells were evaluated from each slide. Representative images are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the standard model of MAP kinase cascades, MAP2Ks such as MKK4 are activated via phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues by MAP3Ks. Therefore, we undertook to identify a MAP3K upstream of MKK4 that was involved in propagating the signal from SEPW1 silencing. We tested siRNAs targeting ASK1, MEKK1, MEKK4, TAK1, TPL2, and MLK3 for their ability to block cell cycle arrest from SEPW1 silencing. None of the six MAP3K siRNAs significantly blocked G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing, suggesting these MAP3Ks may not be involved in signaling G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing (Table 4). However, we only tested one siRNA for each MAP3K, and we did not verify protein knockdown. Thus, we cannot exclude involvement of any of these MAP3Ks.TABLE 4Effect of MAP3K silencing on delayed G1 to S-phase progression due to SEPW1 depletionsiRNA treatmentPercentage of cells (±S.E.)G0 and G1S phaseG2 and MNo transfection61.5 ± 0.629.1 ± 0.48.7 ± 0.4Non-targeting control siRNA61.6 ± 0.5aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.31.1 ± 0.5aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.7.4 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.SEPW1 siRNA s36173.2 ± 0.7bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.22.2 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.6 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.SEPW1 siRNA and MEKK1 siRNA70.7 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.24.4 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.9 ± 0.1bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.SEPW1 siRNA and MEKK4 siRNA86.1 ± 0.6aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.7.9 ± 0.2aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.9 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.SEPW1 siRNA and ASK1 siRNA72.9 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.23.4 ± 0.4bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.3.7 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.SEPW1 siRNA and TAK1 siRNA76.9 ± 0.1aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.17.8 ± 0.1aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.,bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.5.3 ± 0.1bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.SEPW1 siRNA and TPL2 siRNA70.0 ± 0.1bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.22.5 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.7.5 ± 0.4aSignificantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.SEPW1 siRNA and MLK3 siRNA71.5 ± 0.7bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.23.7 ± 0.5bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.4.8 ± 0.2bSignificantly different from non-targeting control siRNA.a Significantly different from SEPW1 siRNA alone.b Significantly different from non-targeting control siRNA. Open table in a new tab Because six MAP3Ks upstream of MKK4 seemed not to be involved in signaling G1 arrest from SEPW1 silencing, we assessed the phosphorylation state of MKK4 in SEPW1-silenced RWPE-1 cells. Antibodies specific for activated MKK4 phosphorylated on Ser-257 and Thr-261 were used to detect activation of MKK4. There was no significant difference between cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA or SEPW1 siRNA 72 h post-transfection (p = 0.682, n = 4, paired t test, Fig. 4), indicating that SEPW1 silencing does not activate MKK4. MKK4 can also be negatively regulated by phosphorylation of Ser-80 (16Spillman M.A. Lacy J. Murphy S.K. Whitaker R.S. Grace L. Teaberry V. Marks J.R. Berchuck A.

However, phosphospecific antibodies directed toward this form of MKK4 did not detect any change in Ser-80 phosphorylation (p = 0.923, n = 5, paired t test, Fig. 4). Therefore, we"
https://openalex.org/W1966562770,"GABA(A) receptors mediate fast inhibitory synaptic transmission. The transmembrane ion channel is lined by a ring of five α helices, M2 segments, one from each subunit. An outer ring of helices comprising the alternating M1, M3, and M4 segments from each subunit surrounds the inner ring and forms the interface with the lipid bilayer. The structural rearrangements that follow agonist binding and culminate in opening of the ion pore remain incompletely characterized. Propofol and other intravenous general anesthetics bind at the βM3-αM1 subunit interface. We sought to determine whether this region undergoes conformational changes during GABA activation. We measured the reaction rate of p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) with cysteines substituted in the GABA(A) receptor α1M1 and β2M3 segments. In the presence of GABA, the pCMBS reaction rate increased significantly in a cluster of residues in the extracellular third of the α1M1 segment facing the β2M3 segment. Mutation of the β2M2 segment 19' position, R269Q, altered the pCMBS reaction rate with several α1M1 Cys, some only in the resting state and others only in the GABA-activated state. Thus, β2R269 is charged in both states. GABA activation induced disulfide bond formation between β2R269C and α1I228C. The experiments demonstrate that α1M1 moves in relationship to β2M2R269 during gating. Thus, channel gating does not involve rigid body movements of the entire transmembrane domain. Channel gating causes changes in the relative position of transmembrane segments both within a single subunit and relative to the neighboring subunits."

Although P5 ATPases are present in every eukaryotic genome analyzed so far, they have remained orphan pumps, and their biochemical function is obscure. We show that a P5A ATPase from barley, HvP5A1, locates to the endoplasmic reticulum and is able to rescue knock-out mutants of P5A genes in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HvP5A1 spontaneously forms a phosphorylated reaction cycle intermediate at the catalytic residue Asp-488, whereas, among all plant nutrients tested, only Ca2+ triggers dephosphorylation. Remarkably, Ca2+-induced dephosphorylation occurs at high apparent [Ca2+] (Ki = 0.25 mm) and is independent of the phosphatase motif of the pump and the putative binding site for transported ligands located in M4. Taken together, our results rule out that Ca2+ is a transported substrate but indicate the presence of a cytosolic low affinity Ca2+-binding site, which is conserved among P-type pumps and could be involved in pump regulation. Our work constitutes the first characterization of a P5 ATPase phosphoenzyme and points to Ca2+ as a modifier of its function.

Our work constitutes the first characterization of a P5 ATPase phosphoenzyme and points to Ca2+ as a modifier of its function. With the rise of genomic sequencing, a group of eukaryotic sequences was discovered clustering together as the fifth subfamily of P-type ATPase pumps (P5 ATPases) (1.Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Evolution of substrate specificities in the P-type ATPase superfamily.J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). P5 ATPases have been identified in every single eukaryotic genome analyzed so far, whereas no homologues can be detected in bacterial genomes (2.Møller A.B. Asp T. Holm P.B. Palmgren M.G.

P-type ATPases form a large superfamily of primary active pumps coupling ATP hydrolysis to the transport of a substrate across the membrane (6.Kühlbrandt W. Biology, structure, and mechanism of P-type ATPases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 7.Palmgren M.G. Nissen P. P-type ATPases.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 243-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The name “P-type” is derived from the fact that they are phosphorylated at a conserved aspartate residue during each catalytic cycle. They are remarkably simple with only a single catalytic subunit and carry out large domain motions during transport. Atomic structure of P-type ATPases in different conformations together with ample mutagenetic evidence have provided detailed insights into the pumping mechanism of these biological nanomachines (8.Morth J.P.

P-type ATPases are very divergent with respect to primary structure but can be recognized in genomes by conserved core sequences and signature motifs. Phylogenetically, P-type ATPases are divided into five subfamilies named P1 through P5 (1.Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Evolution of substrate specificities in the P-type ATPase superfamily.J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). These differ with respect to transported ligands and the way they are regulated. P1-P3 ATPases are well characterized ion pumps as follows: P1A pumps are part of the bacterial K+ transport systems; P1Bs are heavy metal pumps; P2A and P2B are Ca2+ pumps; P2C Na+/K+ are pumps of animals; P2Ds are Na+ pumps of fungi and mosses, and P3As are plasma membrane H+ pumps. In contrast to ion transport, P4 pumps participate in lipid flipping across membranes, whereas P5 ATPases have no assigned specificity so far. P5 ATPases can be identified by a signature sequence, the PPXXP motif, found in transmembrane segment M4, whereas most other P-type ATPases have a PXXX(P/L) motif at the same position that is involved in substrate binding (2.Møller A.B.

P5 ATPases can be phylogenetically divided into two distinct subgroups (P5A and P5B ATPases) having different subcellular localizations and physiological roles (10.Sørensen D.M. Buch-Pedersen M.J.

This study constitutes characterization of a P5A ATPase from barley employing phosphoenzyme formation and degradation as a tool to get insight into the catalytic mechanism. We demonstrate that Ca2+ merely has a modifying effect on protein function but is not likely to be the transported ion. We further show that residues in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation motifs and the putative substrate-binding site in M4 are important for the function of the P5A ATPase. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) at TIGR was used to extract sequence information from barley to generate primers for cloning. TIGR contains 370,546 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from barley. This information was supplemented with the wheat EST information (580,155 available ESTs). BLAST was performed with the sequence of the rice P5A ATPase obtained using PlantsT. ESTs used for cloning were CA497971 (from ATG), BU980814, and CB877529 (3′ UTR). Young leaves were isolated from Hordeum vulgare (barley) variety Golden Promise, and total RNA was extracted using FastRNA Pro green kit (Qbiogene). HvP5A1 gene-specific primers were designed from ESTs and used to generate cDNA fragments with SuperScript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Primers Oli35 5′-ATGGCGCGGTTCGAG-3′ (forward) and Oli36 5′-AGTCCGACAAAATTCTCCTAAACTAC-3′ (reverse) were used to generate HvP5A1.1 and HvP5A1.2, respectively. A BstEII restriction site 1,620 bp within the HvP5A1 sequence was used to ligate the two cDNA clones together to generate a full-length HvP5A1 cDNA clone in the 2.1-TOPO vector (pAM1). The full-length sequence corresponds to GenBankTM accession number BAJ85414. Prediction of transmembrane helices was carried out using the TOPCONS prediction server (21.Bernsel A. Viklund H. Hennerdal A. Elofsson A. TOPCONS. Consensus prediction of membrane protein topology.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W465-W468Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis wild-type (WS-2) seeds and seeds homozygous for the mia tDNA insertion mutant allele (13.Jakobsen M.K. Poulsen L.R. Schulz A. Fleurat-Lessard P. Møller A. Husted S. Schiøtt M. Amtmann A. Palmgren M.G.

After 3 weeks, the plants were transferred to long day conditions (16 h light, 200 μmol m−2 s−1, 70% humidity, 20 °C). Vectors for plant transformation were constructed by insertion of HvP5A1 from KpnI/XbaI-digested plasmid pAM1 into the binary plant transformation vector pPZP211 under the control of the 35S promoter (pAM7). Arabidopsis mia seeds were transformed according to the floral dip method (22.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Floral dip. A simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with pAM7 and empty plasmid pPZP211. For kanamycin selection, plants were grown on agar plates containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (23.Murashige T. Skoog F. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobacco tissue cultures.Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53685) Google Scholar) supplied with 50 mg/liter kanamycin. Kanamycin-selected plants were investigated for the presence of HvP5A1 by PCR on genomic DNA using Oli35 5′-ATGGCGCGGTTCGAG-3′ (forward) and Oli36 5′-AGTCCGACAAAATTCTCCTAAACTAC-3′ (reverse). RNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy kit, and quantitative real time PCR was performed to investigate expression levels of HvP5A1. Gene-specific primers for actin (reverse 5′-TCTGTGAACGATTCCTGGAC-3′ and forward 5′-CTTCCCTCAGCACATTCCAG-3′) were employed for normalization. HvP5A1 and GFP were PCR-amplified and introduced into the TOPO entry Gateway vector pENTR.SD (Invitrogen). A Gateway LR clonase II (Invitrogen) reaction (24.Curtis M.D. Grossniklaus U. A gateway cloning vector set for high throughput functional analysis of genes in planta.Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) resulted in vector pAM10 encoding HvP5A1 fused in its C-terminal end to the N-terminal end of green fluorescent protein (GFP). As a control for ER localization, we used GFP tagged with an ER retention signal (25.Runions J. Brach T. Kühner S. Hawes C. Photoactivation of GFP reveals protein dynamics within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Onion (Allium cepa L.) epidermal strips were placed on agar containing MS salt mixture (1 × MS salt (Invitrogen) 2% agar, 3% sucrose, pH 5.8) and bombarded with either of the three vectors pAM10, GFP, and ER-control using a PDS-1000/He biolistic particle delivery system (Bio-Rad). A total of 10 μg of each expression vector was coated onto 1-μm gold particles and transferred into cells using a hepta adaptor and a helium pressure of 1,100 p.s.i. Following bombardment, Petri dishes containing bombarded epidermal strips were sealed with MicroporeTM tape (Neuss, Germany) and placed in darkness at 22 °C for 18 h. Transformed cells expressing the HvP5A1-GFP fusion protein were visualized using a Zeiss LSM Pascal 5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a C-Apochromat 40 × 1.2 water-immersion lens. The excitation wavelength for GFP was 488 nm. A total of 50 cells for each construct was observed, and images were processed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). A fragment containing the HvP5A1 full-length clone was excised from plasmid pAM1 and inserted into the yeast expression vector YEp351 under control of the constitutive PMA1 promoter (pAM2). The phosphorylation site of HvP5A1 was destroyed by mutation of Asp-488 into Asn hereby generating plasmid pAM3 containing HvP5A1-D488N. A histidine tag (RGS-His6) was introduced in the C terminus of HvP5A1 and HvP5A1-D488N by PCR, generating plasmid pAM5 (HvP5A1-RGS-His6) and pAM6 (HvP5A1-D488N-RGS-His6). Plasmids YEp351 (empty control), pAM5, and pAM6 were expressed in three yeast strains (Euroscarf) Y00000 (wild type; Mata, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0), Y00272 (spf1; Mat a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, YEL031w::kanMX4), and Y01587 (ypk9; Mat a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, YOR291w::kanMX4). Experiments were performed at 30 °C in synthetic minimal media supplemented with galactose (2%), histidine (30 μg/ml), methionine (30 μg/ml), and uracil (30 μg/ml) with indicated amounts of caffeine. Standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot experiments were performed to investigate expression level of proteins using anti-RGS-His6 antibody for detection. Produced vectors were transformed into the yeast expression strain RS72 (MATa, ade1-100, his4-519, leu2-3,112, pPMA1:pGAL) by the lithium acetate method (26.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Transformation of intact yeast-cells treated with alkali cations.J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on minimal media plates containing 0.7% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids; Difco) supplemented with adenine (40 μg/ml), l-histidine (30 μg/ml) and 2% galactose (SGAH). Positive transformants were used to saturate a 100 ml of SGAH pre-culture grown at 30 °C, 150 rpm. At saturation, the cells were transferred to 1 liter of rich medium containing 2% glucose or galactose as indicated, 1% yeast extract and 2% bactopeptone, and grown for 22 h at 25 °C, 150 rpm. For purification of crude membranes, RS72 cultures with transformed constructs were harvested after 22 h by centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 5 min). Homogenization buffer used consisted of 29% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 75 mm MES, pH 6.5, with N-methyl-d-glucamine, and 1 mm DTT. Between purification steps all samples were kept on ice. For each sample, 1 ml of homogenization buffer/g of yeast cells and 40 μl of 0.1 m PMSF and 1 mg/ml pepstatin were added. Ice-cold glass beads (BioSpec) were added to half the volume, and the samples were vortexed five times for 1 min with a minimum of 1 min between shakes on ice. The samples were centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 15 min, 2 °C) followed by ultracentrifugation of the supernatant (50,000 rpm, 1 h, 2 °C). The membrane pellet was dissolved in homogenization buffer, and total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The phosphorylation status of HvP5A1 protein expressed in yeast RS72 crude membranes was measured at 0 °C essentially as described (27.Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G.

Mutation to the glutamate in the fourth membrane segment of Na+,K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase affects cation binding from both sides of the membrane and destabilizes the occluded enzyme forms.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Microsomes of yeast expressing HvP5A1-RGS-His6 as either wild type or with the indicated mutations were diluted in homogenization buffer to 10 μg/μl. 40 μg of total protein was added to a final volume of 50 μl of either standard reaction buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, with N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) or the standard reaction buffer with additions as indicated in the figure legends. Free concentrations of cations and EGTA were calculated by the extended version of MaxChelator. The assay was started by addition of 2.5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 7 μm ATP and was left on ice for 60 s or as indicated before quenching by addition of 400 μl of stop buffer (20% trichloroacetic acid, 1 mm phosphoric acid). For dephosphorylation experiments, chase solutions were added in 5-μl volumes giving the indicated final concentrations before quenching at the indicated time points. For determination of pH dependence, low (pH 5.2) and high (pH 9.6) pH buffers, similar to the standard reaction buffer but with MES replacing MOPS in the low pH buffer, were mixed to give a pH gradient. Similar concentrations of enzyme as used in the reaction measurements were added to 200 μl of standard reaction buffer followed by a short incubation on ice. Following addition of ATP, the final pH of the assay buffers was measured using a pH electrode adjusted to 0 °C. Phosphorylation with inorganic phosphate was carried out in 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm 32Pi, 20 or 40% DMSO, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, adjusted with N-methyl-d-glucamine, at 25 °C. After phosphorylation, all samples were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed once in 400 ml of stop buffer and dissolved in loading buffer (50 μm NaH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.01% SDS, 20 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.014% bromphenol blue, and 0.1 g/ml Li-SDS). An equal amount of protein for each sample was loaded onto 8% acid SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After running, radioactivity was visualized in a phosphorimager scanner (Storm 860, GE Healthcare), and individual bands corresponding to HvP5A1 or the mutated proteins were quantified. The gels were subsequently stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue to ensure an equal loading of protein. Graphs were fitted to Michaelis-Menten or exponential decay kinetics using GraphPad Prism 5.0, and rates constants were estimated from the program. We routinely rehydrated SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to ensure that an equal amount of protein was loaded for each sample. The only plant P5A ATPase characterized so far is AtP5A1/MIA/PDR2, the single P5A ATPase in the model plant A. thaliana (13.Jakobsen M.K. Poulsen L.R. Schulz A. Fleurat-Lessard P. Møller A. Husted S. Schiøtt M. Amtmann A. Palmgren M.G.

As biochemical characterization of the MIA gene product in our hands proved difficult, no matter whether the gene was expressed in planta or in fungal expression systems, we pursued cloning of P5A ATPases from other plants, including barley. One barley EST showed high similarity to the rice gene OsP5 (29.Baxter I. Tchieu J. Sussman M.R. Boutry M. Palmgren M.G. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Axelsen K.B. Genomic comparison of P-type ATPase ion pumps in Arabidopsis and rice.Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and the retrieved sequence information was used for cloning of the full-length barley P5A ATPase, which we named HvP5A1. The resulting cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 1,174 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 131 kDa and contains signature motifs present in all known P-type ATPases (Fig. 1) (6.Kühlbrandt W. Biology, structure, and mechanism of P-type ATPases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). HvP5A1 also contains the P5 ATPase-specific signature sequence PPXXPXX located in the transmembrane helix preceding the large cytoplasmic loop that includes the phosphorylated aspartate residue (6.Kühlbrandt W. Biology, structure, and mechanism of P-type ATPases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The presence of two glutamate residues in the motif (PPELPME) and the presence of 12 predicted membrane-spanning regions (underlined and numbered Mb, Ma, and M1–10; Fig. 1) further links HvP5A1 to the P5A subgroup (2.Møller A.B.

Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutation of Arabidopsis AtP5A1/MIA results in reduced plant stature, reduced sizes of siliques, reduced fertility, and reduced seed yield (13.Jakobsen M.K. Poulsen L.R. Schulz A. Fleurat-Lessard P. Møller A. Husted S. Schiøtt M. Amtmann A. Palmgren M.G. Pollen development and fertilization in Arabidopsis is dependent on the MALE GAMETOGENESIS IMPAIRED ANTHERS gene encoding a type V P-type ATPase.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2757-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test whether MIA and HvP5A1 are functional homologues, the mia mutant was transformed with HvP5A1 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promotor. HvP5A1-transformed mia mutants showed a restoration of silique length and seed yield to that of wild-type levels, whereas transformation with empty plasmid control did not result in rescue of the mia phenotype (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the number of infertile ovules was compared with the number of fertile ovules, and we found that the fertility was restored in the mia HvP5A1 plants (92% compared with 94% in the wild type, n = 30). This demonstrates that HvP5A1 is a functional homologue of MIA. So far, all examined P5A ATPases have been identified in membranes of the secretory pathway (12.Cronin S.R. Rao R."
https://openalex.org/W2054370695,"Optical methods have assumed a leading role in the study of intact nervous system function. In comparison with traditional electrical recordings, optical imaging enables the measurement of activity in many structures at once, including subcellular domains. For observing function at the cellular level, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy allows tracking to be done with spatiotemporal resolution in the micron and millisecond range. Light can also be used to activate brain tissue by using “caged” neurotransmitters and second messengers, and, more recently, by using light-sensitive ion channels, pumps, and receptors to allow optogenetic activation."
