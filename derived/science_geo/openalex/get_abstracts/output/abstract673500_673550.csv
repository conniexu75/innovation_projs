Dai et al. show that treatment with iodine-terminated self-assembled monolayers that react with surface hydroxyl groups (which ultimately creates unwanted charge traps and voids) leads to a 50% increase of adhesion toughness between the electron transport layer and a mixed-composition perovskite thin film. The projected point at which 80% of the operating efficiency in perovskite solar cells was still retained increased from ∼700 to 4000 hours for 1-sun exposure with continuous maximum power point tracking.

Gong et al. used an 8-by-8 two-dimensional (2D) superconducting qubit square lattice containing 62 functional qubits to show how multiple (two) walkers traverse a 2D qubit array, interfering as they go. The authors were also able to program the paths that the walkers follow, demonstrating a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in which a single or multiple quantum walkers coherently traverse two paths before interfering and exiting at a single port. The results illustrate the potential for superconducting-based quantum processors in simulating large-scale quantum systems. Science , abg7812, this issue p. 948"

Here we describe a human embryo model (blastoid) generated by self-organization. Brief induction of trophectoderm leads to formation of blastocyst-like structures within 3 days. Blastoids are composed of three tissue layers displaying exclusive lineage markers, mimicking the natural blastocyst. Single-cell transcriptome analyses confirm segregation of trophectoderm, hypoblast, and epiblast with high fidelity to the human embryo. This versatile and scalable system provides a robust experimental model for human embryo research."

Applying a phylogenetic analysis and recent computational methods to the expanded diversity of bacterial sequences from metagenomic analyses, Coleman et al. infer the root of the eubacterial tree (see the Perspective by Katz). The root was determined without using the Archaea as an outgroup, to avoid the possibility of a false result due to long branch attraction. This method places the eubacterial root in the neighborhood of Fusobacteriota. Using this information, the authors reconstructed the eubacterial ancestor, identifying that this organism likely had a double-membrane cell envelope, flagellum-mediated motility, antiphage defense mechanisms, and diverse metabolic pathways.

https://openalex.org/W3159311544,"Major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I) presents tumour antigens to CD8+ T cells and triggers anti-tumour immunity. Humans may have 30,000–60,000 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, it remains poorly understood whether lncRNAs affect tumour immunity. Here, we identify a lncRNA, lncRNA inducing MHC-I and immunogenicity of tumour (LIMIT), in humans and mice. We found that IFNγ stimulated LIMIT, LIMIT cis-activated the guanylate-binding protein (GBP) gene cluster and GBPs disrupted the association between HSP90 and heat shock factor-1 (HSF1), thereby resulting in HSF1 activation and transcription of MHC-I machinery, but not PD-L1. RNA-guided CRISPR activation of LIMIT boosted GBPs and MHC-I, and potentiated tumour immunogenicity and checkpoint therapy. Silencing LIMIT, GBPs and/or HSF1 diminished MHC-I, impaired antitumour immunity and blunted immunotherapy efficacy. Clinically, LIMIT, GBP- and HSF1-signalling transcripts and proteins correlated with MHC-I, tumour-infiltrating T cells and checkpoint blockade response in patients with cancer. Together, we demonstrate that LIMIT is a cancer immunogenic lncRNA and the LIMIT–GBP–HSF1 axis may be targetable for cancer immunotherapy. Li et al. identify LIMIT as a lncRNA that modulates MHC-I expression through HSP90 and HSF1, thereby regulating antitumour immune response and the efficacy of immunotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W3157976075,"A complete PIC-Mediator structure As a critical transcription coactivator, the multisubunit Mediator complex binds RNA polymerase II (Pol II), facilitates preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly, and stimulates transcription and phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD). However, how these critical transcriptional events are coordinated by Mediator is not fully understood. Chen et al. determined the structures of human Mediator and Mediator-bound PIC in distinct conformational states, the latter of which represents a complete PIC-Mediator complex assembled on the 14-subunit transcription factor IID (TFIID).

https://openalex.org/W3157431283,"Chronic pain is a disabling disease with limited treatment options. While animal models have revealed important aspects of pain neurobiology, therapeutic translation of this knowledge requires our understanding of these cells and networks of pain in humans. We propose a multi-institutional collaboration to rigorously and ethically address this challenge. Chronic pain is a disabling disease with limited treatment options. While animal models have revealed important aspects of pain neurobiology, therapeutic translation of this knowledge requires our understanding of these cells and networks of pain in humans. We propose a multi-institutional collaboration to rigorously and ethically address this challenge. Chronic pain affects over 50 million individuals and is responsible for more than $300 billion in direct medical costs each year in the United States alone. Currently available treatments for chronic pain are often ineffective or have unacceptable side effects. Indeed, the use of opioids for chronic pain has been linked to the doubling of opioid-related overdose deaths over the past decade (Vowles et al., 2015Vowles K.E. McEntee M.L. Julnes P.S. Frohe T. Ney J.P. van der Goes D.N. Rates of opioid misuse, abuse, and addiction in chronic pain: a systematic review and data synthesis.Pain. 2015; 156: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), which underscores the urgent need to develop more effective and safer pain therapeutics. However, despite the broad study of neurobiological systems of pain via animal models over the past 70 years, there are very few examples where therapeutic progress has been made. Although there are multiple factors that have contributed to the limited translation of pain targets identified from studies in animal models, it is clear from recent successes in other areas of medicine that human pathophysiological studies can act as a translational catalyst. Chronic pain is a particularly difficult case in this regard because the cells and networks involved are not readily accessible and the underlying pathophysiology may vary by sex, location, proximal cause, comorbidities, duration, and a range of environmental, immunological, psychosocial, and genetic factors. Most of these variables are difficult to model in animals. Despite these challenges, recent translational successes in oncology and infectious disease illustrate the diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities that are created when the right tools are applied directly to the study of human pathology. While recent advances in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics were built on a foundation of knowledge derived from animal studies, a key translational catalyst occurred when well-phenotyped tissue banks built by prescient oncologists and pathologists were paired with recent advances in next-generation DNA sequencing. In this case, the NIH-funded Cancer Genome Atlas provided the infrastructure needed to execute this work. Similar synergy occurred during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, where dedicated international investment enabled real-time sharing of viral sequence data derived from patients that helped guide vaccine development and approval within months. With decades of fundamental insights about nociception and pain from animal models (Price et al., 2018Price T.J. Basbaum A.I. Bresnahan J. Chambers J.F. De Koninck Y. Edwards R.R. Ji R.R. Katz J. Kavelaars A. Levine J.D. et al.Transition to chronic pain: opportunities for novel therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and a suite of new tools to study genes, cells, and networks with unprecedented resolution, we believe that pain research is now positioned to finally transform pain treatment. However, we currently lack the infrastructure to consistently phenotype and bank human samples as well as the resources and tools to generate actionable knowledge from them. We are pain scientists and physicians who recognize the importance of studying pain pathophysiology in human samples but have struggled to build an infrastructure of sufficient scale independently within our own institutions. If we remain limited to small numbers of samples, our confidence in the molecular and functional differences observed between them will remain equally limited. To distinguish translatable targets from the noise given the vast heterogeneity inherent to the study of chronic pain, we believe that a large multi-institutional consortium is needed. Indeed, efforts in this regard are being pioneered in the United Kingdom (UK Biobank, Advanced Pain Discovery Platform) and serve as a model for broader international collaboration. We propose the formation of a Human Cells and Networks of Pain (HCNP) Consortium that would consist of three categories of collaborative centers tasked with the mission of obtaining high-quality and diverse human samples for molecular and physiological analysis and the immediate public distribution of the data (see Figure 1). We imagine an inclusive structure to these centers such that collaborators with the same mission can be connected within and across institutions. The three consortium centers we propose are as follows:•center 1: clinical centers for pain phenotyping and surgical specimen acquisition;•center 2: recovery of tissue from organ donors and cadavers with fast autopsy;•center 3: sample and data analysis, integration, and distribution. Clinical centers for pain phenotyping and surgical specimen acquisition would focus on developing teams of scientists and surgeons to carefully phenotype patients’ pain prior to a surgery where part of their nervous system or related tissues will be removed. Examples include thoracic vertebrectomy, cervical 1-2 arthrodesis in which dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) can be removed as part of standard care, and excision of peripheral neuromas (Domeshek et al., 2017Domeshek L.F. Krauss E.M. Snyder-Warwick A.K. Laurido-Soto O. Hasak J.M. Skolnick G.B. Novak C.B. Moore A.M. Mackinnon S.E. Surgical Treatment of Neuromas Improves Patient-Reported Pain, Depression, and Quality of Life.Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2017; 139: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This enables characterization of these DRGs at the single neuron level to understand how transcriptomic or physiological changes in nociceptors relate to different pain phenotypes in patients. Most mechanistic human studies have adopted two approaches: (1) a case-control design to identify measures that discriminate groups of patients with chronic pain from control groups and (2) the correlation of mechanistic measures with pain intensity. These approaches, however, do not consider many clinical features that are highly relevant to patients with chronic pain, such as tactile allodynia, mechanical hyperalgesia, and the size of pain area. Functional outcomes are also rarely considered in chronic pain studies but are of the utmost importance to patients. The multiple manifestations and clinically relevant outcomes of chronic pain may be driven by molecular mechanisms that are not necessarily predictive of pain intensity in humans. Thus, there is a substantial need to build a standardized phenotyping research architecture that links findings from molecular studies to the specific clinical manifestations of pain relevant to an individual’s underlying chronic pain. For example, pre-surgery phenotyping (Müller et al., 2021Müller M. Bütikofer L. Andersen O.K. Heini P. Arendt-Nielsen L. Jüni P. Curatolo M. Cold pain hypersensitivity predicts trajectories of pain and disability after low back surgery: a prospective cohort study.Pain. 2021; 162: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) can be correlated with post-excision electrophysiology (North et al., 2019North R.Y. Li Y. Ray P. Rhines L.D. Tatsui C.E. Rao G. Johansson C.A. Zhang H. Kim Y.H. Zhang B. et al.Electrophysiological and transcriptomic correlates of neuropathic pain in human dorsal root ganglion neurons.Brain. 2019; 142: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and single-cell profiling data to understand which clinical phenotypes manifest aberrant spontaneous activity in specific subtypes of nociceptors. This knowledge will facilitate the use of precision medicine approaches that are truly tailored to cell type-specific pain mechanisms for the treatment of pain (Tracey et al., 2019Tracey I. Woolf C.J. Andrews N.A. Composite Pain Biomarker Signatures for Objective Assessment and Effective Treatment.Neuron. 2019; 101: 783-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Clinical centers for specimen procurement would focus on recovery and banking of tissues from organ donors and rapid autopsies. Neural tissues are post-mitotic, and therefore generation of immortal cell lines, as is done for other organ systems, is not possible. Instead, recovery and primary culture of live human neurons from organ donors or cadavers with rapid autopsy is necessary. This requires appropriate clinical infrastructure, on-call specialists for tissue recovery, and in-place agreements with organ procurement organizations to interface with donor families. Although this infrastructure requires substantial support, it has incredible potential to de-risk high impact pain therapeutic leads with preclinical human validation for both academia and industry. The role of center 2 would be to make available freshly recovered, stabilized, and live human peripheral and central nervous system tissue processed with standardized protocols (Valtcheva et al., 2016Valtcheva M.V. Copits B.A. Davidson S. Sheahan T.D. Pullen M.Y. McCall J.G. Dikranian K. Gereau 4th, R.W. Surgical extraction of human dorsal root ganglia from organ donors and preparation of primary sensory neuron cultures.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11: 1877-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to investigators across institutions for anatomical, physiological, and molecular studies. Importantly, these centers would also have the capacity to invite investigators across scientific disciplines to conduct research at their sites, providing training and facile access to human tissues for pain research. Intact and functional skin, nerve, DRG, and spinal cord can be readily obtained from organ donors soon after cross clamp. These tissues along with intracranial structures such as nodose, trigeminal ganglia, and brain can also be collected from cadavers during rapid autopsy. We recommend that specimens are processed via standardized protocols to offer compatibility with the broadest range of downstream assays. In the case of specimens recovered from organ donors, tissues should be processed so that contiguous portions are assigned for both physiological and molecular assays, which will enable the most accurate correspondence between molecular features, physiology, and clinical phenotype. From each donor or cadaver, tissues should be collected from multiple levels (i.e., lumbosacral, thoracic, cervical) whenever feasible. Given the growing appreciation of sex- and age-dependent phenotypes in human pain, it should be the goal to collect tissues from diverse ages, genders, and ancestries. In collaboration with partnering organ procurement organizations, deidentified medical history and phenotyping measures from the medical records of donors should be collected and maintained in a central database available to investigators. The recovery of tissues from donors whose medical histories include well-defined and prevalent chronic pain conditions should be prioritized. The primary aim of this center is to generate, analyze, and distribute molecular and functional data obtained from the samples collected in centers 1 and 2. To generate the data for each sample, we envision that investigators would use a range of cutting-edge molecular and functional tools. Some of the molecular approaches include whole-genome sequencing, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, each of which have been revolutionized by recent advances in single-cell technologies. Single-cell technologies have now made it possible to make cell type-specific and spatial/structure-specific molecular measurements across donor or patient nervous system samples. For example, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to rapidly identify sets of genes that are expressed preferentially within in human nociceptor subtypes, which may help identify more selective pain therapeutic targets. These single-cell technologies have already been applied to basic pain research models and post-mortem human nervous system tissues, so they are primed to make transformative discoveries in human pain biology (Renthal et al., 2020Renthal W. Tochitsky I. Yang L. Cheng Y.C. Li E. Kawaguchi R. Geschwind D.H. Woolf C.J.

Gereau IV, R.W. et al.Spatial transcriptomics reveals unique molecular fingerprints of human nociceptors.bioRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.06.430065Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Although improved molecular insight into the human cells that mediate pain may identify a wealth of potential therapeutic targets, clinical translation of these targets will require a deep functional understanding of these cells. Fortunately, protocols have already been developed for culturing and recording from human peripheral and central nervous system neurons (Valtcheva et al., 2016Valtcheva M.V. Copits B.A. Davidson S. Sheahan T.D. Pullen M.Y. McCall J.G. Dikranian K. Gereau 4th, R.W. Surgical extraction of human dorsal root ganglia from organ donors and preparation of primary sensory neuron cultures.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11: 1877-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (also see Allen Brain Atlas [https://celltypes.brain-map.org/]). Integrating electrophysiological data from primary human cultures with molecular assays can improve our understanding of how specific therapeutic targets affect human neuronal function (Davidson et al., 2014Davidson S. Copits B.A. Zhang J. Page G. Ghetti A. Gereau 4th, R.W. Human sensory neurons: Membrane properties and sensitization by inflammatory mediators.Pain. 2014; 155: 1861-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We will also be able to directly compare molecular and physiological properties between native DRG nociceptors derived from surgical tissue and those derived from the same donor via induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology. These studies are critical for validating the utility of iPSCs as a scalable screening tool for next-generation pain therapeutics and can help inform ongoing efforts, such as those currently underway at the NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences to develop iPSC-derived nociceptor-like neurons. If successful, iPSC-derived nociceptor lines could be established from patients with a range of chronic pain conditions for disease modeling, drug screening, and determination of optimal therapeutic intervention. We envision these types of integrative analyses across molecular, physiological, and clinical data types would be a core mission of investigators in center 3. Where prior experience exists, the HCNP Consortium can and should build on the lessons learned from previous efforts to share specimens for downstream applications. For example, the NIH-sponsored Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) have standardized recovery and processing protocols for assays related to preserving data quality in RNA-seq studies. However, many of the factors that affect data quality for tissues and assays that are critical for studies of pain have not yet been determined. For example, age, sex, post-mortem interval, medical comorbidities, and cause of death could significantly affect the properties and representation of cells in human DRG cultures or live human spinal cord slices; however, because of the limited number of specimens available to any one lab, a systematic evaluation of these factors has not been possible. The HCNP Consortium would be uniquely positioned to address this gap given the scale and collaborative nature of this effort. We envision the center will also take on the critical task of maintaining a public database of the deidentified samples collected and the data types available for each sample so that investigators around the world can rapidly access the data to answer their unique questions. We envision these data and analyses will create an enduring in silico resource that can be used to identify, validate, and de-risk pain targets, which will help attract additional interest and investment and accelerate therapeutic development toward the clinical stage. The magnitude and impact of chronic pain must be matched by the scale and ingenuity of our response. Working together, this human-based pain discovery platform will energize the entire pain field, from academia to industry. The data generated will provide opportunities for laboratories across institutions, countries, and research disciplines to apply their unique expertise to help understand chronic pain by using the most relevant and high-quality tissues for the greatest translational impact. The training of students and fellows must be a critical component of this effort as well to ensure the next generation of pain scientists and physicians are prepared to continue this translational work for years to come. We are confident that better understanding of human pain cells and networks will serve to catalyze new pain therapeutic development and ultimately benefit the millions of suffering patients worldwide."

To decode the transcriptional modules that regulate this structure during development, we compiled a catalog of 1116 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) identified de novo and then profiled 96,789 single cells from the early human fetal striatum. We found that D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs) arise from a common progenitor and that lineage commitment is established during the postmitotic transition, across a pre-MSN phase that exhibits a continuous spectrum of fate determinants. We then uncovered cell type-specific gene regulatory networks that we validated through in silico perturbation.

Different conditions revealed novel differential interactions, which often uncovered functional connections between distantly related gene pairs.

We developed a high-throughput framework to map noncoding DNA functions with single-nucleotide resolution in four loci that control erythroid fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression, a genetically determined trait that modifies sickle cell disease (SCD) phenotypes. Specifically, we used the adenine base editor ABEmax to introduce 10,156 separate A•T to G•C conversions in 307 predicted regulatory elements and quantified the effects on erythroid HbF expression. We identified numerous regulatory elements, defined their epigenomic structures and linked them to low-frequency variants associated with HbF expression in an SCD cohort. Targeting a newly discovered γ-globin gene repressor element in SCD donor CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors raised HbF levels in the erythroid progeny, inhibiting hypoxia-induced sickling. Our findings reveal previously unappreciated genetic complexities of HbF regulation and provide potentially therapeutic insights into SCD. An ABEmax-based screen identifies regulatory noncoding nucleotides in four loci that control erythroid fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression.

https://openalex.org/W3157631523,"Ecuador is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, but faces severe pressures and threats to its natural ecosystems. Numerous species have declined and require to be objectively evaluated and quantified, as a step towards the development of conservation strategies. Herein, we present an updated National Red List Assessment for amphibian species of Ecuador, with one of the most detailed and complete coverages for any Ecuadorian taxonomic group to date. Based on standardized methodologies that integrate taxonomic work, spatial analyses, and ecological niche modeling, we assessed the extinction risk and identified the main threats for all Ecuadorian native amphibians (635 species), using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Our evaluation reveals that 57% (363 species) are categorized as Threatened, 12% (78 species) as Near Threatened, 4% (26 species) as Data Deficient, and 27% (168 species) as Least Concern. Our assessment almost doubles the number of threatened species in comparison with previous evaluations. In addition to habitat loss, the expansion of the agricultural/cattle raising frontier and other anthropogenic threats (roads, human settlements, and mining/oil activities) amplify the incidence of other pressures as relevant predictors of ecological integrity. Potential synergic effects with climate change and emergent diseases (apparently responsible for the sudden declines), had particular importance amongst the threats sustained by Ecuadorian amphibians. Most threatened species are distributed in montane forests and paramo habitats of the Andes, with nearly 10% of them occurring outside the National System of Protected Areas of the Ecuadorian government. Based on our results, we recommend the following actions: (i) An increase of the National System of Protected Areas to include threatened species. (ii) Supporting the ex/in-situ conservation programs to protect species considered like Critically Endangered and Endangered.

https://openalex.org/W3159631263,"Despite the development of new targeted and immune therapies, the prognosis of metastatic melanoma remains bleak. Therefore, it is critical to better understand the mechanisms controlling advanced melanoma to develop more effective treatment regimens. Hedgehog/GLI (HH/GLI) signaling inhibitors targeting the central pathway transducer Smoothened (SMO) have shown to be clinical efficacious in skin cancer; however, several mechanisms of non-canonical HH/GLI pathway activation limit their efficacy. Here, we identify a novel SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex driving the expression of GLI1, the final effector of the HH/GLI pathway, providing a novel mechanism of non-canonical SMO-independent activation of HH/GLI signaling in melanoma. Consistently, we find a positive correlation between the expression of GLI1 and SOX2 in human melanoma samples and cell lines. Further, we show that combined targeting of canonical HH/GLI pathway with the SMO inhibitor MRT-92 and of the SOX2-BRD4 complex using a potent Proteolysis Targeted Chimeras (PROTACs)-derived BRD4 degrader (MZ1), yields a synergistic anti-proliferative effect in melanoma cells independently of their BRAF, NRAS, and NF1 mutational status, with complete abrogation of GLI1 expression. Combination of MRT-92 and MZ1 strongly potentiates the antitumor effect of either drug as single agents in an orthotopic melanoma model. Together, our data provide evidence of a novel mechanism of non-canonical activation of GLI1 by the SOX2-BRD4 transcriptional complex, and describe the efficacy of a new combinatorial treatment for a subset of melanomas with an active SOX2-BRD4-GLI1 axis."
https://openalex.org/W3157951030,"Organs consist of multiple cell types that ensure proper architecture and function. How different cell types coexist and interact to maintain their homeostasis in vivo remains elusive. The skin epidermis comprises mostly epithelial cells, but also harbours Langerhans cells (LCs) and dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs). Whether and how distributions of LCs and DETCs are regulated during homeostasis is unclear. Here, by tracking individual cells in the skin of live adult mice over time, we show that LCs and DETCs actively maintain a non-random spatial distribution despite continuous turnover of neighbouring basal epithelial cells. Moreover, the density of epithelial cells regulates the composition of LCs and DETCs in the epidermis. Finally, LCs require the GTPase Rac1 to maintain their positional stability, density and tiling pattern reminiscent of neuronal self-avoidance. We propose that these cellular mechanisms provide the epidermis with an optimal response to environmental insults."

We investigated the neural representation of modality-specific hidden variables associated with task structure in the auditory cortex and the updating mechanism involving top-down input from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The auditory cortex has been shown to encode important perceptual decision information during stimulus categorization (Bizley and Cohen, 2013Bizley J.K. Cohen Y.E.

Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging from the auditory cortex, we found that a subpopulation of auditory cortex (ACx) neurons encode the category boundary estimate, a hidden variable associated with task structural knowledge. Using pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition, we found that the long-distance OFC-to-ACx projection is required for ACx coding of updated boundary estimate. Furthermore, using pathway-specific chemogenetic silencing, we show that the OFC-ACx projection plays a causal role specifically in stimulus re-categorization (behavioral flexibility) but was not required for sensory discrimination. Finally, by performing two-photon imaging directly from the axons of the OFC-ACx projection, we measured the top-down signals during behavior and found that activity in OFC axons encodes the value prediction error signals corresponding to the feedback signals described in our model, critical for inferring task state changes. These data indicate that the ACx represents modality-specific task structural knowledge that was used for inference-based flexible decision-making and that the top-down feedback signals from the OFC inform task state transition constrained by the structural knowledge. We developed an adaptive categorization task for head-fixed mice (Figures 1A and S1) based on the auditory two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) paradigm (Zhong et al., 2019Zhong L. Zhang Y. Duan C.A. Deng J. Pan J. Xu N.L. Causal contributions of parietal cortex to perceptual decision-making during stimulus categorization.Nat. Neurosci. 2019; 22: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and a previous flexible auditory categorization task (Jaramillo et al., 2014Jaramillo S. Borges K. Zador A.M. Auditory thalamus and auditory cortex are equally modulated by context during flexible categorization of sounds.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 5291-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mice were required to discriminate various pure tones (7 tones spaced equally at a logarithmic scale between 7 kHz and 28 kHz) as being higher or lower than a predefined category boundary and to report their decisions by licking the left or right spout to obtain a water reward. The predefined category boundary could change without explicit cues across blocks of trials within a session, either 10 kHz in the “low boundary” block or 20 kHz in the “high boundary” block. For the tone stimuli between the two category boundaries (11,061 Hz, 14,000 Hz, and 17,598 Hz), called “reversing stimuli,” mice needed to reverse their choices under different boundary conditions (Figure 1A). For all blocks, the trial numbers and reward sizes were balanced for the left and right choice sides. The occurrence of different sound stimuli was close in left or right trials (STAR Methods). This trial design, while maintaining balanced choice values, ensured that the primary information indicating the boundary change was from the choice outcomes in reversing trials instead of from large differences in stimulus compositions in different blocks, as in previously reported tasks (Jaramillo et al., 2014Jaramillo S. Borges K. Zador A.M. Auditory thalamus and auditory cortex are equally modulated by context during flexible categorization of sounds.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 5291-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2020Wang T.-Y. Liu J. Yao H. Control of adaptive action selection by secondary motor cortex during flexible visual categorization.eLife. 2020; 9: e54474Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After training, mice were able to rapidly change their choices in different blocks, exhibiting different subjective categorization boundaries, as indicated by the “bias” of the psychometric functions (Figure 1B). The changes in the subjective boundaries matched the two predefined category boundaries (Figure 1C; low boundary blocks, bias = 0.65 ± 0.03 in octave; high boundary blocks, bias = 1.17 ± 0.04 in octave). Across different blocks, the slope of the psychometric function, which reflects discrimination sensitivity, was not changed significantly (Figure 1D; low boundary blocks, slope = 11.61 ± 3.26; high boundary blocks, slope = 12.73 ± 2.45), suggesting that the sensory discrimination was largely unchanged for different category boundaries. In theory, animals may have different ways to adjust behavioral choices when adapting to environmental (or task rule) changes. In our task, one way is to gradually adjust choices upon reversing stimuli using trial and error based on direct experiences of behavior outcomes for every reversing stimulus. Another way is to use higher-level structural knowledge acquired over prior training to constrain possible task states so that a change in task state could be quickly inferred after encountering only a small subset of stimuli with changed choice outcomes. The latter is consistent with the concepts of learning sets and cognitive maps developed in earlier classical studies of animal behavior showing that, after prior training, animals could acquire task structural knowledge via latent learning, leading to more rapid improvement of behavioral performance (Harlow, 1949Harlow H.F. The formation of learning sets.Psychol. Rev. 1949; 56: 51-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar; Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3490) Google Scholar). Here we also found that the number of reversing trials before mice start to switch choices was reduced gradually over training (Figures 1E–1G), indicating that mice were able to more rapidly change their subjective category boundary upon rule switching. This is consistent with the possibility that mice learned the task structure knowledge over prior training sessions and used the knowledge to achieve more rapid within-session choice switching via task state inference. To further test whether mice were using an inference-based strategy, we examined how mice changed their choices upon reversing stimuli following block transition. After each block transition, the choice outcomes of reversing stimuli would be informative of the task rule change. If mice used direct experience to learn the task state change via trial and error, they would need to experience every reversing stimulus at least once after block transition. Conversely, if mice could use task structural knowledge to infer state change upon rule switching, then they would switch their choices for reversing stimuli after only experiencing part of the reversing stimuli. In this scenario, the choice outcome of the first reversing stimulus encountered after block transition can serve as evidence of inference, whereas the following trials presenting other reversing stimuli would be the “inference trials” (Figure 1A, top right), where the task state inference would play a role in making decisions. Indeed, we found that mice showed a low probability of choice switching (correct rate) for the first reversing stimulus after block transition but then showed significantly higher level of choice switching in the inference trials (Figure 2C). The low probability of choice switching for the first reversing stimulus is consistent with the fact that there were no explicit cues to indicate task rule changes, whereas the significantly increased choice switch probability in the inference trials indicates that mice used an inference-based strategy to rapidly update their internal estimate of the category boundary after the task rule change. To further quantify the internal estimate of the category boundary, a hidden variable associated with task structural knowledge, we constructed a reinforcement learning (RL) model with a belief state (BS) that depends on prior knowledge about task structure. Similar models have also been described in previous studies (Babayan et al., 2018Babayan B.M. Uchida N. Gershman S.J. Belief state representation in the dopamine system.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Gershman and Uchida, 2019Gershman S.J. Uchida N. Believing in dopamine.Nat. Rev.

Decision making under uncertainty: a neural model based on partially observable markov decision processes.Front. Comput. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 146Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this model, the agent combines prior acquired task structural knowledge, which is the boundary-dependent stimulus categorization, with the estimated current category boundary to make categorical decisions (Figure 2A). The estimate of the current boundary was updated trial by trial based on the value prediction errors following choice outcomes in reversing trials. This model is different from standard model-free RL in that the value prediction error was not used to directly update the action value but to update the subjective estimate of the category boundary, a hidden variable constrained by prior task knowledge. Moreover, the choice value was determined by combining prior task knowledge, current boundary estimate, and perceived stimulus (STAR Methods). Our model is consistent with the idea that knowledge about task structure acquired through prior experience could guide estimation of the current task state to make efficient adjustments of choice upon rule switching (Botvinick et al., 2019Botvinick M. Ritter S. Wang J.X. Kurth-Nelson Z. Blundell C. Hassabis D. Reinforcement Learning, Fast and Slow.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2019; 23: 408-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For trained mice, this model recapitulates the choice behavior in reversing trials (Figure 2B) and shows a significant increase of switch probability in inference trials after boundary switching, similar to actual behavioral performance (Figure 2C). In addition, we found that, when the first reversing stimulus was closer to the new boundary and, hence, further away from the learned boundary in the previous block, mice exhibited a greater probability of choice switching for the first inference trials (Figure 2D). This is likely to be due to the fact that, when the reversing stimulus is farther away from the internal boundary (learned from prior block), the choice tends to be more confident and the greater the error the reward omission would produce after rule switching. Therefore, this observation suggests that the effectiveness of inference depended on the size of the prediction error, consistent with prediction error-based updating of boundary estimation under the RL framework. This trend was also captured by our model (Figure 2D). Compared with a standard RL model that directly updates action values for each stimulus (Sutton and Barto, 2018Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. MIT Press, 2018Google Scholar), our BS-RL model uses decision value prediction errors to update the decision boundary estimate, an abstract hidden task variable, and, hence, exhibited significantly better performance in capturing inference-based behavior (Figures S2G–S2J). Using this model, we were able to quantify hidden decision variables, including the category boundary estimate and decision value prediction, which could not be measured directly from behavior. Next we sought to determine the neuronal representations of the hidden task variables associated with task structural knowledge. The category boundary estimate is a modality-specific variable in the auditory domain, and therefore it is likely that this variable is encoded in the ACx. The ACx in rodents plays important roles in hearing-related cognition by not only encoding bottom-up sensory features (Nelken, 2004Nelken I. Processing of complex stimuli and natural scenes in the auditory cortex.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) but also by representing task-related information (Francis et al., 2018Francis N.A. Winkowski D.E. Sheikhattar A. Armengol K.

We thus examined how ACx neurons encode important variables related to inference-based auditory categorization by imaging population neuronal activity in the ACx using in vivo two-photon microscopy during task performance. We expressed GCaMP6s in layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) excitatory neurons in the ACx using adeno-associated virus (AAV), with calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) promoter, and imaged neuronal calcium signals through a chronic window implanted over the ACx (Figure 3A). An advantage of our complex behavioral task design is that it provides a variety of trial types, allowing us to disambiguate neuronal selectivity to different variables, including sensory, choice, reward, and task rules (Figure 3B). For example, neuronal activity encoding sensory stimuli tends to be similar in correct and error trials (different choices), whereas neural activity encoding choice information would be distinct in correct and error trials with the same sensory stimulus. Likewise, neurons encoding reward would show differential responses between correct and error trials regardless of left or right choices or stimulus differences. In addition, our current behavioral design with different decision rules in different blocks of trials allows identification of neuronal coding for task rules (block types). We used n-way ANOVA (Chen et al., 2017Chen T.-W. Li N. Daie K. Svoboda K. A Map of Anticipatory Activity in Mouse Motor Cortex.Neuron. 2017; 94: 866-879.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to capture these distinctions (Figure S3E; STAR Methods). We found that different subgroups of neurons showed selectivity to different task variables, including sensory, choices, reward, and block type, consistent with previous observations (Xin et al., 2019Xin Y. Zhong L. Zhang Y. Zhou T. Pan J. Xu N.L. Sensory-to-Category Transformation via Dynamic Reorganization of Ensemble Structures in Mouse Auditory Cortex.Neuron. 2019; 103: 909-921.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Of particular interest here is the population of neurons showing selectivity to category boundary conditions in different block of trials. As shown in Figure 3C, these neurons show differential responses between boundary conditions in reversing and non-reversing trials. In correct non-reversing trials, sensory stimuli and choices are identical between boundary conditions; therefore, the response difference between blocks reflects task rule-dependent modulation. We further quantified the extent of neuronal selectivity for boundary conditions by constructing a selectivity index based on receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis (STAR Methods) and identified the two populations of neurons showing significant selectivity to high-boundary or low-boundary conditions (Figure 3F). These boundary condition-selective neurons appear to be distributed in the ACx without discernable dependence on the frequency preference of nearby neurons (Figures S4A–S4C). Because the predefined category boundary is the hidden task variable unobservable to the animal, instead of directly encoding the high- or low-category boundaries, the activity of these boundary condition-selective neurons may encode internal cognitive variables reflecting the category boundary. To test this, we examined the relationship between responses of these neurons and the trial-by-trial subjective estimate of the category boundary, as described in our model (Figure 2). We found that the responses of individual neurons preferring low-boundary or high-boundary blocks were correlated significantly with the boundary estimate across trials in the same session (Figures 3H and 3I, orange and green). Such correlation was also significant in the summarized responses from all boundary condition-selective neurons (Figure 3J, black). Thus, some neurons in the ACx encode the inferred category boundary, reflecting task structural knowledge critical for flexible categorization behavior. In our task, correctly estimating the current category boundary requires inference of the hidden task state based on choice outcome changes; therefore, representation of the updated boundary estimate in the ACx may require feedback of state-informative outcomes. The OFC has been proposed to represent task state space (Schuck et al., 2016Schuck N.W. Cai M.B. Wilson R.C. Niv Y.

https://openalex.org/W3159127889,"Reptiles, including birds, exhibit a range of behaviorally relevant adaptations that are reflected in changes to the structure of the inner ear. These adaptations include the capacity for flight and sensitivity to high-frequency sound. We used three-dimensional morphometric analyses of a large sample of extant and extinct reptiles to investigate inner ear correlates of locomotor ability and hearing acuity. Statistical analyses revealed three vestibular morphotypes, best explained by three locomotor categories-quadrupeds, bipeds and simple fliers (including bipedal nonavialan dinosaurs), and high-maneuverability fliers. Troodontids fall with Archaeopteryx among the extant low-maneuverability fliers. Analyses of cochlear shape revealed a single instance of elongation, on the stem of Archosauria. We suggest that this transformation coincided with the origin of both high-pitched juvenile location, alarm, and hatching-synchronization calls and adult responses to them."

New approaches that allow for the study of structures that relate directly to behavior are greatly improving our understanding of the lifestyles of extinct animals (see the Perspective by Witmer). Hanson et al. looked at three-dimensional scans of archosauromorph inner ears and found clear patterns relating these bones to complex movement, including flight. Choiniere et al. looked at inner ears and scleral eye rings and found a clear emergence of patterns relating to nocturnality in early theropod evolution. Together, these papers reveal behavioral complexity and evolutionary patterns in these groups. Science , this issue p. 601 , p. 610 ; see also p. 575"

https://openalex.org/W3157802238,"The mammalian sex chromosome system (XX female/XY male) is ancient and highly conserved. The sex chromosome karyotype of the creeping vole (Microtus oregoni) represents a long-standing anomaly, with an X chromosome that is unpaired in females (X0) and exclusively maternally transmitted. We produced a highly contiguous male genome assembly, together with short-read genomes and transcriptomes for both sexes. We show that M. oregoni has lost an independently segregating Y chromosome and that the male-specific sex chromosome is a second X chromosome that is largely homologous to the maternally transmitted X. Both maternally inherited and male-specific sex chromosomes carry fragments of the ancestral Y chromosome. Consequences of this recently transformed sex chromosome system include Y-like degeneration and gene amplification on the male-specific X, expression of ancestral Y-linked genes in females, and X inactivation of the male-specific chromosome in male somatic cells. The genome of M. oregoni elucidates the processes that shape the gene content and dosage of mammalian sex chromosomes and exemplifies a rare case of plasticity in an ancient sex chromosome system."
https://openalex.org/W3157862394,"Antimicrobial resistance is (AMR) an emerging global public health problem. Rationale use of antibiotic can prevent the rise of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to understand the knowledge, attitude and practice on antibiotic usage and AMR among the veterinarians and para-veterinarians in Bhutan.A cross-sectional questionnaire survey among the veterinarians and para-veterinarians was conducted from June to July 2020. A score of one to the correct answers and zero for the wrong answers was allotted to each respondent answers. The total score was added and those who scored above the mean was categorized as having good knowledge and favourable attitude.A total of 219 animal health workers participated in this study. The mean knowledge score was 12.05 ±1.74 with 38.8% of the respondents having good knowledge on antibiotic use and AMR. Similarly, the mean scores for the attitude level were 8.32±1.61 with 51% them having favorable attitude towards antibiotic usage and AMR. The mean practice score was 3.83±1.06 with 77% of them having good practices on antibiotic use. The respondents who read national plan on AMR were found to have good knowledge on antibiotics and AMR (AOR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.19-4.82). The female respondents (AOR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.01-4.61), respondents from the eastern region (AOR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.18-5.44), west central (AOR: 3; 95% CI: 1.30-6.92), animal health supervisors (AOR: 9.77; 95% CI: 1.98-48.29), and livestock production supervisors (AOR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.21-6.35) have favorable attitude towards antibiotics and AMR.Our study identified that most animal health workers in Bhutan had poor knowledge on antibiotics usage and AMR. Therefore, regular awareness education on antibiotics and AMR in the form of refresher course/training must be provided to the animal health workers in the country to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W3157978034,"Isoquinoline alkaloids (IQs) from Macleaya cordata are promising natural products for enhancing the growth performance and overall health condition of farmed animals. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of two formulas of IQ extract, provided in either a powdered formula (IQ-E) or a water-soluble, granulated formula (IQ-WS) and containing the main active component sanguinarine at a concentration of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, on the growth, survival, immune response, and resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection of Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ). In Experiment 1, the postlarvae were divided into five groups (four replicates/group and 100 shrimp/tank) and fed four times/day for 30 days with a control feed, IQ-E at 200 or 300 mg/kg of feed, or IQ-WS at 100 or 150 mg/kg of feed. In Experiment 2, the surviving shrimp from Experiment 1 were redistributed into six groups (four treatment groups as in Experiment 1 plus the positive and negative controls with four replicates/group and 30 shrimp/tank) and challenged with V . parahaemolyticus by immersion at a concentration of 10 3 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and were fed with the same diets for another 14 days. The results revealed that all IQ-fed shrimp in Experiment 1 had significantly enhanced survival rates and immune parameters (total hemocyte count and phagocytic, phenoloxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities) compared to the control group, even though the growth performances were similar across all groups. In Experiment 2, all IQ-fed groups showed better growth performance and survival rates compared to the positive control. Other than in the positive control group, no histopathological lesions in the hepatopancreas and the intestine were found. In summary, the current study demonstrated the benefits of using IQs from M . cordata as feed additives for improving the growth performance, survival rate, immune responses, and resistance to vibriosis of Pacific white shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W3158946585,"Abstract Transcription factor MYB has recently emerged as a promising drug target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we have characterized a group of natural sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), previously shown to suppress MYB activity, for their potential to decrease AML cell proliferation. Unlike what was initially thought, these compounds inhibit MYB indirectly via its cooperation partner C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs affect the expression of a large number of MYB-regulated genes, suggesting that the cooperation of MYB and C/EBPβ broadly shapes the transcriptional program of AML cells. We show that expression of GFI1 , a direct MYB target gene, is controlled cooperatively by MYB, C/EBPβ, and co-activator p300, and is down-regulated by C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs, exemplifying that they target the activity of composite MYB-C/EBPβ-p300 transcriptional modules. Ectopic expression of GFI1, a zinc-finger protein that is required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, partially abrogated STL-induced myelomonocytic differentiation, implicating GFI1 as a relevant target of C/EBPβ-inhibitory STLs. Overall, our data identify C/EBPβ as a pro-leukemogenic factor in AML and suggest that targeting of C/EBPβ may have therapeutic potential against AML."
https://openalex.org/W3159942716,"A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) is a cell-surface metalloprotease that serves as the principle sheddase for tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), and several ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), regulating these crucial signaling pathways. ADAM17 activation requires its transmembrane domain, but not its cytoplasmic domain, and little is known about the role of this domain in vivo. To investigate, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate the endogenous Adam17 locus in mice to produce a mutant ADAM17 lacking its cytoplasmic domain (Adam17Δcyto). Homozygous Adam17Δcyto animals were born at a Mendelian ratio and survived into adulthood with slightly wavy hair and curled whiskers, consistent with defects in ADAM17/EGFR signaling. At birth, Adam17Δcyto mice resembled Adam17−/− mice in that they had open eyes and enlarged semilunar heart valves, but they did not have bone growth plate defects. The deletion of the cytoplasmic domain resulted in strongly decreased ADAM17 protein levels in all tissues and cells examined, providing a likely cause for the hypomorphic phenotype. In functional assays, Adam17Δcyto mouse embryonic fibroblasts and bone-marrow-derived macrophages had strongly reduced ADAM17 activity, consistent with the reduced protein levels. Nevertheless, ADAM17Δcyto could be stimulated by PMA, a well-characterized posttranslational activator of ADAM17, corroborating that the cytoplasmic domain of endogenous ADAM17 is not required for its rapid response to PMA. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 plays a pivotal role in vivo in regulating ADAM17 levels and function.

However, the functional significance of the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 in vivo has remained elusive. The goal of this study was to generate mice carrying a mutant form of endogenous ADAM17 that lacks its cytoplasmic domain, including all previously described signaling motifs, in order to learn more about the role of the cytoplasmic domain in regulating the function of ADAM17 in vivo. In order to generate mice that express endogenous ADAM17 with a truncated cytoplasmic domain, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce a targeted knock-in (KI) mutation, in which an HA-tag with a stop codon was attached immediately C-terminal to the transmembrane domain of ADAM17 (following DKKLD699, Fig. 1A, see Experimental procedures and Fig. S1 for details). The resulting mutant ADAM17Δcyto lacks almost all of the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 (cytoplasmic amino acid residues 700–827) and corresponds to an ADAM17Δcyto mutant that fully rescues ADAM17-dependent shedding when overexpressed in Adam17−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mEFs) (27Le Gall S.M. Maretzky T. Issuree P.D.A. Niu X.-D. Reiss K. Saftig P. Khokha R. Lundell D. Blobel C.P. ADAM17 is regulated by a rapid and reversible mechanism that controls access to its catalytic site.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 3913-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Founder mice carrying the Adam17Δcyto KI mutation were generated following standard protocols (see Experimental procedures for details) and bred to homozygosity. The presence of the Adam17Δcyto mutation was verified by sequencing PCR fragments from genomic DNA of mutant mice compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 1, B and C). Offspring of heterozygous matings (Adam17Δcyto/+ x Adam17Δcyto/+) were genotyped by genomic PCR (Fig. 1D) and were born at the expected Mendelian ratio (Fig. 1E). Homozygous mutant Adam17Δcyto animals appeared grossly normal (Fig. 2A) and did not display behavioral abnormalities during routine handling compared with wild-type controls. However, closer inspection revealed that Adam17Δcyto mice had slightly wavy fur (Fig. 2B) and curly whiskers (Fig. 2C, red arrows), which are characteristic phenotypes for mice carrying mutations affecting ADAM17/EGFR signaling (16Chalaris A.

A, representative images of the heads of newborn wild-type and Adam17Δcyto (littermates) and Adam17−/− mice show open eyes at birth (OEB) in Adam17Δcyto mutants that are similar to the OEB in Adam17−/− mice (top row, white arrows). Corresponding H&E-stained sections of the eye are shown in row 2, with an asterisk marking the open eyelid. Sections of a representative pulmonic valve (middle panel/row 3) and aortic valve (row 4) show similarly enlarged and misshapen tricuspid valves in Adam17Δcyto mutants compared with Adam17−/− mice. However, the growth plate in the Adam17Δcyto mutant appeared normal in size and comparable to the wild-type control and did not display the enlarged zone of hypertrophic cells seen in Adam17−/− mice (bottom row). Scale bars: sections of eyes and femurs, 100 μm, sections of heart valves, 50 μm. B, representative images of the aortic and pulmonic valves in adult Adam17Δcyto mutants are indistinguishable from wild-type controls (left panels). The hair follicles and skin of Adam17Δcyto mutants showed pyogranulomatous inflammation, which also affected the meibomian glands in the eyelids and the zymbal glands near the ear canal (Fig. 3B, right panels).

In addition, we found pyogranulomatous inflammation of hair follicles in the skin and in the meibomian glands in eyelids and zymbal glands near the ear canal, which are both specialized sebaceous glands (Fig. 3B, right panels). There were no other major evident pathological phenotypes in the adult Adam17Δcyto mice compared with their littermate controls. The hypomorphic phenotype of Adam17Δcyto mice raised questions about the underlying cause for the apparently reduced activity of ADAM17. We therefore performed western blots on Concanavalin A-enriched glycoproteins isolated from wild-type, Adam17Δcyto, and Adam17−/− mEFs with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of mouse ADAM17 (anti-A17-ecto). The samples were run under denaturing, but nonreducing conditions, since the anti-A17-ecto antibodies only recognize nonreduced ADAM17 in western blots (see Fig. S2 and Experimental procedures for details). Under these conditions, the anti-A17-ecto antibody detected the wild-type proform of ADAM17 (Fig. 4A, indicated by an open arrowhead) as well as the mature form (indicted by a black arrowhead) in mEFs. By comparison, the levels of pro-ADAM17Δcyto (open arrowhead) and mature ADAM17Δcyto (black arrowhead) were strongly reduced. When wild-type cells were lysed in the absence of metalloprotease inhibitors (marimastat and 1,10 Phenanthroline, see Experimental procedures for details), the mature form of wild-type ADAM17 underwent postlysis autocatalytic removal of the cytoplasmic domain, as reported previously (47Schlöndorff J.

A similar postlysis autocatalytic removal of the cytoplasmic domain was also observed in the related ADAM10 and is thought to have no biological significance in ADAM17 or ADAM10 (49Brummer T. Pigoni M. Rossello A. Wang H. Noy P.J. Tomlinson M.G. Blobel C.P. Lichtenthaler S.F. The metalloprotease ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) undergoes rapid, postlysis autocatalytic degradation.FASEB J. 2018; 32: 3560-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The proform of ADAM17Δcyto (open arrowhead in Fig. 4A, darker exposure shown on the right) migrated faster than the proform of wild-type ADAM17, consistent with the predicted reduction in molecular weight caused by deletion of the cytoplasmic domain. The mature form of ADAM17Δcyto (black arrowhead in Fig. 4A) comigrated approximately with the autodegraded form of mature wild-type ADAM17 (asterisk). However, the presence or absence of the metalloprotease inhibitors during cell lysis did not affect the migration of mature ADAM17Δcyto. This suggests that ADAM17Δcyto was not detectably subjected to postlysis processing"

https://openalex.org/W3157843589,"Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is the defining global health crisis of this time. It is responsible for significant morbidity and has had severe socioeconomic consequences. This study aims to assess the knowledge, preparedness and attitudes of medical students, physicians and faculty members in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on COVID-19 and their perspective on the roles of educational and healthcare institution towards improving pandemic preparedness and enabling optimal care. Methodology An exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 participants, using a non-probability convenience sampling method. English-speaking participants from the medical field aged 18 and above were included in the study. The validated questionnaire was administered online and distributed across social media platforms from May-July 2020. T-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney-U test were used when appropriate. Responses were analysed and statistical tests applied using IBM SPSS, version 25. Results The knowledge scores were calculated amongst different ages and professional status, and the mean was 59.08% (SD = 12.848%). Almost half of the participants obtained poor knowledge scores (less than 60%). Most of the participants followed the latest updates on COVID-19 (86.7%). The majority opted to obtain information from the national health authorities (63.4%). The mean preparedness score among the participants was 68.65% (SD = 17.456%). Being in contact with patients significantly increased the preparedness score ( p &lt; 0.001). Only 27.9% of the participants believed their college education provided adequate knowledge to deal with epidemics or pandemics. Several barriers affect willingness to work in a pandemic, with 80.6% of participants worried about posing a risk to family members. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of establishing tailored COVID-19 related education programs to improve knowledge levels, especially in medical students. Efforts are still needed to promote effective control measures and address the barriers affecting willingness to work in a pandemic."

Yet, many women make their first antenatal visit with the pregnancy already compromised due to fetomaternal complications. This study aimed to fill this dearth using the 2016 national representative data set to augment early antenatal care visits in Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study design using the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data set. Kaplan-Meir estimate was used to explain the median survival time of the timing of the first ANC visit. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify the factors related to the timing of the first ANC visit. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) with a 95% Confidence interval (CI) plus a p-value of < 0.05 were considered to declare a statistically significant association.Data for 4666 study participants who had ANC follow-up history during pregnancy were included in the study and analyzed. The overall median survival time in this study was seven months. The timing of the first ANC visit was shorter by 2.5 times (AHR: 2.5; 95% CI: 2.34-3.68), 4.3 times (AHR: 4.3; 95% CI: 2.2-7.66), 4.8 times (AHR: 4.8, 95% CI: 4.56-10.8) among women who attended primary, secondary, and higher education as compared with non-educated one. Similarly, women who were residing in urban areas had 3.6 times (AHR: 3.6; 95% CI: 2.7-4.32) shorter timing of first ANC visit than rural residents. Furthermore, the timing of the first visit among the richest women was 3.2 times (AHR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.5-9.65) shorter than the poorest women.The median survival time of the first ANC visit was seven months. The timing of the first ANC was longer among younger, poorer women, those who had no access to media, who considered distances as a big challenge to reach a health facility and, those with no education. Therefore, health care providers and community health workers should provide health education to create community awareness regarding the timing of the first ANC visit."
https://openalex.org/W3157227416,"Previous research has shown that the built environment plays a crucial role for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health care utilization. But, there is limited evidence on the independence of this association from lifestyle and social environment. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate these associations, independent of the social environment, physical activity and body mass index (BMI). We used data from the third follow-up of the Swiss study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart diseases In Adults (SAPALDIA), a population based cohort with associated biobank. Covariate adjusted multiple quantile and polytomous logistic regressions were performed to test associations of variables describing the perceived built environment with HRQoL and health care utilization. Higher HRQoL and less health care utilization were associated with less reported transportation noise annoyance. Higher HRQoL was also associated with greater satisfaction with the living environment and more perceived access to greenspaces. These results were independent of the social environment (living alone and social engagement) and lifestyle (physical activity level and BMI). This study provides further evidence that the built environment should be designed to integrate living and green spaces but separate living and traffic spaces in order to improve health and wellbeing and potentially save health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W3158279613,"Quantifying the contribution of rheumatoid arthritis to the acquisition of subsequent health care costs is an emerging focus of the rheumatologic community and payers of health care. Our objective was to determine the healthcare costs before and after diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the public payer's perspective. The study design was a longitudinal observational administrative data-based cohort with RA cases from Ontario Canada (n = 104,933) and two control groups, matched 1:1 on year of cohort entry from 2001 to 2016. The first control group was matched on age, sex and calendar year of cohort entry (diagnosis year for those with RA); the second group added medical history to the match before RA diagnosis year. The main exposure was new onset RA. The secondary exposure was calendar year of RA diagnosis to compare attributable costs over the study observation window. Main outcomes were health care costs in 2015 Canadian dollars, overall and by cost category. We used attribution methods to classify costs into those associated with RA, those associated with comorbidities, and age/sex-related underlying costs. Health care costs associated with RA increased up to the year of diagnosis, where they reached $8,591: $4,142 in RA associated costs; $1,242 in RA comorbidity associated costs; and $3,207 in underlying costs. In the eighth-year post diagnosis, the RA costs declined to $2,567 while the RA comorbidity associated costs remained relatively constant at $1,142, and the underlying age/sex related cost increased to $4,426. RA patients had lower costs when diagnosed in later calendar years. Our results suggest a large proportion of disease related health care costs are a result of costs associated with RA comorbidities, which may appear many years before diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3158872560,"Background Gastrointestinal problems affect the health and quality of life of individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT) and pose a medical hardship for their caregivers. We hypothesized that the variability in the RTT phenotype contributes to the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and metabolome in RTT, predisposing these individuals to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Objectives We characterized the gut bacterial microbiome and metabolome in girls and young women with RTT (n = 44) and unaffected controls (n = 21), and examined the relation between the composition of the microbiome and variations in the RTT phenotype. Methods Demographics and clinical information, including growth and anthropometric measurements, pubertal status, symptoms, clinical severity score, bowel movement, medication use, and dietary intakes were collected from the participants. Fecal samples were collected for analysis of the gut microbiome using Illumina MiSeq-based next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene followed by bioinformatics analysis of microbial composition, diversity, and community structure. Selected end-products of microbial protein metabolism were characterized by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results The gut bacterial microbiome differed within the RTT cohort based on pubertal status (p&lt;0.02) and clinical severity scores (p&lt;0.02) of the individuals and the type of diet (p&lt;0.01) consumed. Although the composition of the gut microbiome did not differ between RTT and unaffected individuals, concentrations of protein end-products of the gut bacterial metabolome, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (p&lt;0.001), tyrosine (p&lt;0.02), and glutamate (p&lt;0.06), were lower in the RTT cohort. Differences in the microbiome within RTT groups, based on symptomatic anxiety, hyperventilation, abdominal distention, or changes in stool frequency and consistency, were not detected. Conclusions Although variability in the RTT phenotype contributes to the dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, we presently cannot infer causality between gut bacterial dysbiosis and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Nevertheless, alterations in the gut metabolome may provide clues to the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal problems in RTT."

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1164 people from the age of 60 upwards, of which 63 had a prior diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia. The results showed that, globally, the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III possesses adequate psychometrics properties. Furthermore, the information function test shows that the subscales have different sensitivity to different levels of impairment. These results can contribute to determining patterns of cognitive deterioration for the adequate detection of different levels of dementia.

We undertook the observer agreement and correlation analyses of Scheie's angle width and pigmentation gradings and detection of peripheral anterior synechia and Sampaolesi line.The respective Fleiss' kappa values for the four elements between manual gonioscopy and automated gonioscope by the glaucoma specialist were 0.22, 0.40, 0.32 and 0.58. Additionally, the respective intraobserver agreements for the four elements by the glaucoma specialist each were 0.32 to 0.65, 0.24 to 0.71, 0.35 to 0.70, and 0.20 to 0.76; the Fleiss' kappa coefficients for the four elements among the three glaucoma specialists were, respectively, 0.31, 0.38, 0.31, and 0.17; the Fleiss' kappa coefficients for the angle width and pigmentation gradings between the two glaucoma specialists each were 0.30 to 0.35, and 0.29 to 0.43, respectively. Overall, the Kendall's tau coefficients for the angle gradings reflected the positive correlations in the evaluations.Our findings suggested slight-to-substantial intraobserver agreement and slight-to-fair (among the three) or fair-to-moderate (between the two each) interobserver agreement for the angle assessments using GS-1 gonio-photos even by glaucoma specialists. Sufficient training and a solid consensus should allow us to perform more reliable angle assessments using gonio-photos with high reproducibility."

Our objective was to determine the clinical diagnoses, demographic characteristics, and medical severity of high-use pediatric patients in Canada.We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients <18 years of age who either were admitted to hospital or visited an emergency department (ED) using the Canadian Institute for Health Information's (CIHI) Dynamic Cohort of Complex, High System Users. The analysis of hospital admission data excluded Quebec and Manitoba. ED data was only available for Alberta and Ontario.121 104 patients were identified as the most frequent hospital users and 459 998 patients as the most frequent ED users. High users were more likely to reside in a rural community, to be in a lower income quintile, and face more deprivation. The most frequent conditions for hospitalization for high use patients were disorders related to length of prematurity and fetal growth, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period, and haemorrhagic and haematological disorders of fetus and newborn. For the most frequent ED users, the most common clinical diagnoses were acute upper respiratory infections, injuries to the head, and diseases of the middle ear and mastoid.Pediatric high users by frequency of hospital and ED services are a distinct population. Better understanding their characteristics will allow for more appropriate planning of children's health services and help identify areas for effective preventive or quality improvement initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3158803187,"Abstract The integration of viral DNA into the host genome is mediated by viral integrase, resulting in the accumulation of double-strand breaks. Integrase-derived peptides (INS and INR) increase the number of integration events, leading to escalated genomic instability that induces apoptosis. CD24 is a surface protein expressed mostly in cancer cells and is very rarely found in normal cells. Here, we propose a novel targeted cancer therapeutic platform based on the lentiviral integrase, stimulated by integrase-derived peptides, that are specifically delivered to cancerous cells via CD24 antigen-antibody targeting. INS and INR were synthesized and humanized and anti-CD24 antibodies were fused to the lentivirus envelope. The activity, permeability, stability, solubility, and toxicity of these components were analyzed. Cell death was measured by fluorescent microscopy and enzymatic assays and potency were tested in vitro and in vivo. Lentivirus particles, containing non-functional DNA led to massive cell death (40–70%). Raltegravir, an antiretroviral drug, inhibited the induction of apoptosis. In vivo, single and repeated administrations of INS/INR were well tolerated without any adverse effects. Tumor development in nude mice was significantly inhibited (by 50%) as compared to the vehicle arm. In summary, a novel and generic therapeutic platform for selective cancer cell eradication with excellent efficacy and safety are presented."
https://openalex.org/W3157632543,"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most common cause of vertigo in humans, yet the molecular etiology is currently unknown. Evidence suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in some cases of idiopathic BPPV, particularly in familial cases, but the responsible genetic variants have not been identified. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing [including untranslated regions (UTRs)] of 12 families and Sanger sequencing of additional 30 families with recurrent BPPV in Caucasians from the United States (US) Midwest region, to identify the genetic variants responsible for heightened susceptibility to BPPV. Fifty non-BPPV families were included as controls. In silico and experimental analyses of candidate variants show that an insertion variant rs113784532 (frameshift causing truncation) in the neural cadherin gene PCDHGA10 (protocadherin-gamma A10) is an exceedingly strong candidate (p = 1.80x10-4 vs. sample controls; p = 5.85x10-19 vs. ExAC data; p = 4.9x10-3 vs. NHLBI exome data). The mutant protein forms large aggregates in BPPV samples even at young ages, and affected subjects carrying this variant have an earlier onset of the condition than those without [average 44.0±14.0 (n = 16) versus 54.4±16.1 (n = 36) years old, p = 0.054]. In both human and mouse inner ear tissues, PCDHGA10 is expressed in ganglia, hair cells and vestibular transitional epithelia. Fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization using mouse inner ear tissues shows that expression increases with age. In summary, our data show that a variant in the PCDHGA10 gene may be involved in causing or aggravating some familial cases of recurrent idiopathic BPPV."

Chem. 2021; 296: 100608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which was founded 50 years ago, and we illustrated the breadth of the science contained within it with ten informative review articles. The second half of this collection is a continuation of our celebrations to mark this momentous anniversary. Part 2 provides eight more superb articles describing how the PDB has influenced biology over the course of the last half-century and how biology has fueled the deposition of impactful structures in the PDB. Here are some brief synopses of the articles you will enjoy in part 2! Our understanding of cellular signaling is dependent on the knowledge of key protein structures. In their review, Susan S. Taylor (University of California, San Diego) and colleagues use cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model system to show us the many levels of detail of the structural basis of signaling (2Taylor S.S. Wu J. Bruystens J.G.H. Del Rio J.C. Lu T.-W. Kornev A.P. Ten Eyck L.F. From structure to the dynamic regulation of a molecular switch: A journey over three decades.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The authors describe the landmark structure of the catalytic subunit of PKA and then explore how the kinase domain is packaged in an inactive state by the cAMP binding regulatory subunits. The review also captures the importance of understanding crystal packing, using multiple structural determination methods, and thinking outside the box. Transcriptional regulation is fundamental to cellular homeostasis, coordinating responses to a wide array of physiological signals. In her review, Cynthia Wolberger (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) focuses on how the structures of protein–DNA complexes have provided insights into regulation of transcription (3Wolberger C. How structural biology transformed studies of transcription regulation.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). She describes some of the earliest structures that were determined in the 1980s and explores the structural basis for the remarkable diversity of sequence-specific binding modes. She then discusses the multimeric complexes that are utilized in eukaryotic systems and the ability of cryo-electron microscopy to enable visualization of very large macromolecular complexes with ever-increasing molecular detail, now facilitating the structural understanding of large transcription and elongation machines. The field of structural immunology was born 50 years ago with the first determination of antibody structures. In their review, Ian Wilson (The Scripps Research Institute) and his colleague Robyn Stanfield trace how structures were pivotal to our understanding of antibody–antigen interactions and revealed the diversity of the antigen receptors and the antigens in the immune system (4Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. 50 Years of structural immunology.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). They describe the wealth of structural information we have gathered about viral antigens of enveloped viruses, which are responsible for life-threatening diseases such as influenza, HIV, and COVID-19. The way in which the experimental challenges of sample preparation and structure determination have been overcome highlights the progress that has enabled structural biology to be such an effective method for understanding health and disease. Another field of biological science that has emerged hand in hand with the PDB is protein homeostasis—the array of cellular networks dedicated to maintaining the health of the proteome. Helen Saibil (Birkbeck College) provides an exciting and informative review of the evolution of the field of protein homeostasis, from the first structures of chaperonins to the recent elucidation of protein aggregate structures (5Saibil H.R. The PDB and protein homeostasis: From chaperones to degradation and disaggregase machines.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In parallel, she describes how the determination of these structures has relied increasingly on cryo-electron microscopy. Recent exciting advances that are opening doors to the complex cellular physiology of protein homeostasis include complexes containing multiple chaperones along with their substrates and emerging methods to observe protein homeostasis machines in their cellular context. Structural Genomics (SG) as a field unto itself was an outgrowth of the huge amount of data produced by the genome sequencing projects and the resultant challenge of determining the structures of the proteins encoded by every genome. Andrzej Joachimiak (Argonne National Laboratory and University of Chicago) and his colleague Karolina Michalska describe how worldwide structural genomics programs attempted to meet this challenge, developing high-throughput pipelines for all steps en route to structural characterization (6Michalska K. Joachimiak A. Structural genomics and Protein Data Bank.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These efforts have resulted in a large number of unique structures and vastly improved methods for all of structural biology. Traditionally, single methods including X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy were deployed to elucidate macromolecular structures. In recent years, it has been recognized that the data from multiple experimental methods combined with computational modeling empower the determination of integrative models of large macromolecular machines. Andrej Sali (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank and University of California San Francisco) describes how this type of integrative modeling using results from multiple approaches is done, the challenges it presents, and how a pipeline is being created for archiving these data (7Sali A. From integrative structural biology to cell biology.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). He ends his review by describing the future of integrative “metamodeling,” showing how it can be used to model an entire cell. An inadvertent and undesirable outcome from presenting the beautiful structures in the PDB is that they can create an impression that macromolecules are static. George Phillips (Rice University) and his colleague Mitchell Miller dispel this notion, examining the ways in which biomolecular dynamics are studied (8Miller M.D. Phillips Jr., G.N. Moving beyond static snapshots: Protein dynamics and the Protein Data Bank.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As case studies, they explore the numerous methods that have been used to analyze the binding of gaseous ligands to myoglobin and explore its overall dynamics, as well as the many different analyses of adenylate kinase that have led to a better understanding of its mechanism of catalysis. The use of both free electron lasers and cryo-electron microscopy has made it possible to get much deeper insight into dynamics. A new challenge will be how to best archive protein dynamics data so they will be useful for further research. The last review in our collection chronicles how the visualization of macromolecular structure depiction evolved hand in hand with the PDB and advanced the ability of researchers to appreciate and functionally interpret molecular architecture. Jane and David Richardson (Duke University) and David Goodsell (The Scripps Research Institute and Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank) have together changed how we think of macromolecular structure and how we use images to better understand the biological processes we seek to elucidate (9Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Goodsell D.S. Seeing the PDB.J. Biol. Chem. 2021; 296: 100742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What is even more fun and informative, particularly to those who were not privy to the developments in structure visualization as they emerged, is to see the artistry that underlies the human appreciation for complex three-dimensional molecular structures. The compilation of wonderful reviews in this second part of our thematic JBC issue celebrating the 50th anniversary of the PDB, together with the reviews included in part 1, illustrates the spectrum of hugely impressive science enabled by the establishment of the PDB to facilitate open sharing of macromolecular structures. Moreover, it is abundantly clear that the advances in biological science in which the PDB played a role also led to a synergistic evolution of the PDB to serve the scientific community in ever better ways. There is so much to celebrate! And so much wonderful science to embrace! We hope you enjoy the terrific articles in this collection as much as we do.

https://openalex.org/W3158447429,"Anoctamin-1 (ANO1) (TMEM16A) is a calcium-activated chloride channel that plays critical roles in diverse physiological processes, such as sensory transduction and epithelial secretion. ANO1 levels have been shown to be altered under physiological and pathological conditions, although the molecular mechanisms that control ANO1 protein levels remain unclear. The ubiquitin–proteasome system is known to regulate the levels of numerous ion channels, but little information is available regarding whether and how ubiquitination regulates levels of ANO1. Here, we showed that two E3 ligases, TRIM23 and TRIM21, physically interact with the C terminus of ANO1. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that whereas TRIM23 ubiquitinated ANO1 leading to its stabilization, TRIM21 ubiquitinated ANO1 and induced its degradation. Notably, ANO1 regulation by TRIM23 and TRIM21 is involved in chemical-induced pain sensation, salivary secretion, and heart-rate control in mice, and TRIM23 also mediates ANO1 upregulation induced by epidermal growth factor treatment. Our results suggest that these two antagonistic E3 ligases act together to control ANO1 expression and function. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating ANO1 protein levels and identify a potential molecular link between ANO1 regulation, epidermal growth factor, and other signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3157196305,"Modern navigation satellite communication has the characteristic of high transmitting rate. To avoid bit errors in data transmission, low density parity check (LDPC) codes are widely recognized as efficient ways for navigation communication. Conventionally, the LDPC decoding is applied for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and degrades severely while facing the impulsive noise. However, navigation communication often suffers from impulsive interference due to the occurrence of high amplitude ""spikes"". At this time, the conventional Gaussian noise assumption is inadequate. The impulsive component of interference has been found to be significant which influences the reliability of transmitted information. Therefore the LDPC decoding algorithms for AWGN channel are not suitable for impulsive noise environments. Consider that LDPC codes over GF(q) perform better than binary LDPC in resisting burst errors for current navigation system, it is necessary to conduct research on LDPC codes over GF(q). In this paper, an optimized initialization by calculating posterior probabilities of received symbols is proposed for non-binary LDPC decoding on additive white Class A noise (AWAN) channel. To verify the performance of the proposed initialization, extensive experiments are performed in terms of convergence, validity, and robustness. Preliminary results demonstrate that the decoding algorithm with the optimized initialization for non-binary LDPC codes performs better than the competing methods and that of binary LDPC codes on AWAN channel."
https://openalex.org/W3158047084,"I walked into the classroom feeling nervous. It wasn't my first time teaching undergraduate students about human endocrine physiology. I knew the material well. But today's lecture was different. I pulled up slides depicting a hypothetical cancer patient and told them, “Patient X had a biopsy that detected invasive carcinoma in her breast.” I described the many months of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatments she went through before going into remission. Then I taught the students about the hormonal therapy she was prescribed—drugs her doctor hoped would limit the growth of any remaining cancer cells and prevent a recurrence. On the final slide, I showed them a picture of me on my last day of chemotherapy. “I am patient X,” I revealed."
https://openalex.org/W3159902901,"Branchiostomatidae (lancelets or amphioxus) comprises about 30 species, several of which are well-established models in evolutionary development. Our zoological and ecological knowledge of the family is nonetheless limited. Despite evident differences can be found among known populations, the taxonomy of Branchiostoma lanceolatum (type species of the genus Branchiostoma) has never been investigated with modern methods through its range in the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. We address this via a multilocus molecular approach and comparing specimens collected from different European populations. Results obtained here confirm the presence of a single species inhabiting the range between the topotypical localities of B. lanceolatum (Atlantic Ocean) and of its junior synonym B. lubricum (Mediterranean Sea), without evincing geographical structure between populations. This suggests that environment most likely drives the characteristics observed in different geographic areas. The long larval phase and the slow mutation rate in lancelets may have played a key role in the evolutionary history of this iconic species."
