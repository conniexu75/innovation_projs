Although most studies have evaluated CAR expression in T cells, here we evaluate different CAR constructs that improve natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing. We identified a CAR containing the transmembrane domain of NKG2D, the 2B4 co-stimulatory domain, and the CD3ζ signaling domain to mediate strong antigen-specific NK cell signaling. NK cells derived from human iPSCs that express this CAR (NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells) have a typical NK cell phenotype and demonstrate improved anti-tumor activity compared with T-CAR-expressing iPSC-derived NK cells (T-CAR-iPSC-NK cells) and non-CAR-expressing cells. In an ovarian cancer xenograft model, NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with PB-NK cells, iPSC-NK cells, or T-CAR-iPSC-NK cells. Additionally, NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells demonstrate in vivo activity similar to that of T-CAR-expressing T cells, although with less toxicity. These NK-CAR-iPSC-NK cells now provide standardized, targeted ""off-the-shelf"" lymphocytes for anti-cancer immunotherapy."

However, specificity remains a concern especially when modifying stem cell populations. We show that existing rationally engineered Cas9 high-fidelity variants have reduced on-target activity when using the therapeutically relevant ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery method. Therefore, we devised an unbiased bacterial screen to isolate variants that retain activity in the RNP format. Introduction of a single point mutation, p.R691A, in Cas9 (high-fidelity (HiFi) Cas9) retained the high on-target activity of Cas9 while reducing off-target editing. HiFi Cas9 induces robust AAV6-mediated gene targeting at five therapeutically relevant loci (HBB, IL2RG, CCR5, HEXB, and TRAC) in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as primary T cells. We also show that HiFi Cas9 mediates high-level correction of the sickle cell disease (SCD)-causing p.E6V mutation in HSPCs derived from patients with SCD. We anticipate that HiFi Cas9 will have wide utility for both basic science and therapeutic genome-editing applications."
https://openalex.org/W2884566703,"Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota-derived metabolite that enhances both platelet responsiveness and in vivo thrombosis potential in animal models, and TMAO plasma levels predict incident atherothrombotic event risks in human clinical studies. TMAO is formed by gut microbe-dependent metabolism of trimethylamine (TMA) moiety-containing nutrients, which are abundant in a Western diet. Here, using a mechanism-based inhibitor approach targeting a major microbial TMA-generating enzyme pair, CutC and CutD (CutC/D), we developed inhibitors that are potent, time-dependent, and irreversible and that do not affect commensal viability. In animal models, a single oral dose of a CutC/D inhibitor significantly reduced plasma TMAO levels for up to 3 d and rescued diet-induced enhanced platelet responsiveness and thrombus formation, without observable toxicity or increased bleeding risk. The inhibitor selectively accumulated within intestinal microbes to millimolar levels, a concentration over 1-million-fold higher than needed for a therapeutic effect. These studies reveal that mechanism-based inhibition of gut microbial TMA and TMAO production reduces thrombosis potential, a critical adverse complication in heart disease. They also offer a generalizable approach for the selective nonlethal targeting of gut microbial enzymes linked to host disease limiting systemic exposure of the inhibitor in the host."

In plants, timely transition to a flowering state is crucial for successful reproduction6-9. EARLY BOLTING IN SHORT DAY (EBS) is a negative transcriptional regulator that prevents premature flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana10,11. We found that EBS contains bivalent bromo-adjacent homology (BAH)-plant homeodomain (PHD) reader modules that bind H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, respectively. We observed co-enrichment of a subset of EBS-associated genes with H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and Polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2). Notably, EBS adopted an autoinhibition mode to mediate its switch in binding preference between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. This binding balance was critical because disruption of either EBS-H3K27me3 or EBS-H3K4me3 interaction induced early floral transition. Our results identify a bivalent chromatin reader capable of recognizing two antagonistic histone marks, and we propose a distinct mechanism of interaction between active and repressive chromatin states."
https://openalex.org/W2884295418,"Prophylactic vaccination of rhesus macaques with rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors expressing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antigens (RhCMV/SIV) elicits immune responses that stringently control highly pathogenic SIV infection, with subsequent apparent clearance of the infection, in ~50% of vaccinees. In contrast, here, we show that therapeutic RhCMV/SIV vaccination of rhesus macaques previously infected with SIV and given continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) beginning 4–9 d post-SIV infection does not mediate measurable SIV reservoir clearance during over 600 d of follow-up on cART relative to RhCMV/control vaccination. However, none of the six animals started on cART on day four or five, across both RhCMV/SIV- and RhCMV/control-vaccinated groups, those rhesus macaques with SIV reservoirs most closely resembling those of prophylactically RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated and protected animals early in their course, showed post-cART viral rebound with up to nine months of follow-up. Moreover, at necropsy, these rhesus macaques showed little to no evidence of replication-competent SIV. These results suggest that the early SIV reservoir is limited in durability and that effective blockade of viral replication and spread in this critical time window by either pharmacologic or immunologic suppression may result in reduction, and potentially loss, of rebound-competent virus over a period of ~two years. Early and prolonged administration of antiretroviral therapy to SIV-infected and post-exposure-vaccinated rhesus macaques was associated with absence or delay of detectable virus after therapy interruption."

https://openalex.org/W2885808532,"B7-H3 is a tumor-promoting glycoprotein that is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues, but is overexpressed in various human cancers which is associated with disease progression and poor patient outcome. Although numerous publications have reported the correlation between B7-H3 and cancer progression in many types of cancers, mechanistic studies on how B7-H3 regulates cancer malignancy are rare, and the mechanisms underlying the role of B7-H3 in drug resistance are almost unknown. Here we report a novel finding that upregulation of B7-H3 increases the breast cancer stem cell population and promotes cancer development. Depletion of B7-H3 in breast cancer significantly inhibits the cancer stem cells. By immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we found that B7-H3 is associated with the major vault protein (MVP) and activates MEK through MVP-enhancing B-RAF and MEK interaction. B7-H3 expression increases stem cell population by binding to MVP which regulates the activation of the MAPK kinase pathway. Depletion of MVP blocks the activation of MEK induced by B7-H3 and dramatically inhibits B7-H3 induced stem cells. This study reports novel functions of B7-H3 in regulating breast cancer stem cell enrichment. The novel mechanism for B7-H3-induced stem cell propagation by regulating MVP/MEK signaling axis independent of the classic Ras pathway may have important implications in the development of strategies for overcoming cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W2887199015,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most aggressive brain cancers without effective therapeutics. The Hippo pathway transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ were implicated as drivers in GBM progression and could be therapeutic targets. Here we found in an unbiased screen of 1650 compounds that amlodipine is able to inhibit survival of GBM cells by suppressing YAP/TAZ activities. Instead of its known function as an L-type calcium channel blocker, we found that amlodipine is able to activate Ca2+ entry by enhancing store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Amlodipine as well as approaches that cause store depletion and activate SOCE trigger phosphorylation and activation of Lats1/2, which in turn phosphorylate YAP/TAZ and prevent their accumulation in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, we identified that protein kinase C (PKC) beta II is a major mediator of Ca2+-induced Lats1/2 activation. Ca2+ induces accumulation of PKC beta II in an actin cytoskeletal compartment. Such translocation depends on inverted formin-2 (INF2). Depletion of INF2 disrupts both PKC beta II translocation and Lats1/2 activation. Functionally, we found that elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ or PKC beta II expression inhibits YAP/TAZ-mediated gene transcription. In vivo PKC beta II expression inhibits GBM tumor growth and prolongs mouse survival through inhibition of YAP/TAZ in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. Our studies indicate that Ca2+ is a crucial intracellular cue that regulates the Hippo pathway and that triggering SOCE could be a strategy to target YAP/TAZ in GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2810071777,"Defining mechanisms that maintain tissue stem cells during homeostasis, stress, and aging is important for improving tissue regeneration and repair and enhancing cancer therapies. Here, we show that Id1 is induced in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by cytokines that promote HSC proliferation and differentiation, suggesting that it functions in stress hematopoiesis. Genetic ablation of Id1 increases HSC self-renewal in serial bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays, correlating with decreases in HSC proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Id1-/- HSCs have a quiescent molecular signature and harbor less DNA damage than control HSCs. Cytokines produced in the hematopoietic microenvironment after γ-irradiation induce Id1 expression. Id1-/- HSCs display a blunted proliferative response to such cytokines and other inducers of chronic proliferation including genotoxic and inflammatory stress and aging, protecting them from chronic stress and exhaustion. Thus, targeting Id1 may be therapeutically useful for improving HSC survival and function during BMT, chronic stress, and aging."

https://openalex.org/W2887200816,"Understanding where and how fire patterns may change is critical for management and policy decision-making. To map future fire patterns, statistical correlative models are typically developed, which associate observed fire locations with recent climate maps, and are then applied to maps of future climate projections. A potential source of uncertainty is the common omission of static or dynamic vegetation as predictor variables. We therefore assessed the sensitivity of future fire projections to different combinations of vegetation maps used as explanatory variables in a statistically based fire modeling framework. We compared models without vegetation to models that incorporated static vegetation maps and that included output from a dynamic vegetation model that imposed three scenarios of fire and one scenario of land use change. We mapped projected future probability of all and large fires (> = 40 ha) under two climate scenarios in a heterogeneous study area spanning a large elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Results showed high model sensitivity to the treatment of vegetation as a predictor variable, particularly for models of large fire probability and for models accounting for wildfire effects on vegetation, which lowered future fire probability. Some scenarios resulted in opposite directional trends in the extent and probability of future fire, which could have serious implications for policy and management resource allocation. Model sensitivity resulted from high relative importance of vegetation variables in the baseline models and from large predicted changes in vegetation, particularly when simulating wildfire. Although statistical fire models often omit vegetation due to uncertainty, model sensitivity demonstrated here suggests a need to account for that uncertainty. Coupling statistical and processed based models may be a promising approach to reflect a more plausible range of scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2886213633,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors are significant components during fundamental cellular processes. FGF18 plays a distinctive role in modulating the activity of both tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the expression and functional role of FGF18 in gastric cancer (GC) and elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. The upregulation of FGF18 was detected in seven out of eleven (63.6%) GC cell lines. In primary GC samples, FGF18 was overexpressed in genomically stable and chromosomal instability subtypes of GC and its overexpression was associated with poor survival. Knocking down FGF18 inhibited tumor formation abilities, induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and enhanced anti-cancer drug sensitivity. Expression microarray profiling revealed that silencing of FGF18 activated ATM pathway but quenched TGF-β pathway. The key factors that altered in the related signaling were validated by western blot and immunofluorescence. Meanwhile, treating GC cells with human recombinant FGF18 or FGF18-conditioned medium accelerated tumor growth through activation of ERK-MAPK signaling. FGF18 was further confirmed to be a direct target of tumor suppressor, miR-590-5p. Their expressions showed a negative correlation in primary GC samples and more importantly, re-overexpression of FGF18 partly abolished the tumor-suppressive effect of miR-590-5p. Our study not only identified that FGF18 serves as a novel prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in GC but also enriched the knowledge of FGF-FGFR signaling during gastric tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2887231879,"In recent years, immunogenic cell death (ICD) has emerged as a revolutionary concept in the development of novel anticancer therapies. This particular form of cell death is able, through the spatiotemporally defined emission of danger signals by the dying cell, to induce an effective antitumor immune response, allowing the immune system to recognize and eradicate malignant cells. To date, only a restricted number of chemotherapeutics can trigger ICD of cancer cells. We previously reported that a peptide, called RT53, spanning the heptad leucine repeat region of the survival protein AAC-11 fused to a penetrating sequence, selectively induces cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, B16F10 melanoma cells treated by RT53 were able to mediate anticancer effects in a tumor vaccination model. Stimulated by this observation, we investigated whether RT53 might mediate ICD of cancer cells. Here, we report that RT53 treatment induces all the hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, as defined by the plasma membrane exposure of calreticulin, release of ATP and the exodus of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) from dying cancer cells, through a non-regulated, membranolytic mode of action. In a prophylactic mouse model, vaccination with RT53-treated fibrosarcomas prevented tumor growth at the challenge site. Finally, local intratumoral injection of RT53 into established cancers led to tumor regression together with T-cell infiltration and the mounting of an inflammatory response in the treated animals. Collectively, our results strongly suggest that RT53 can induce bona fide ICD of cancer cells and illustrate its potential use as a novel antitumor and immunotherapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2887529632,"Avian eggshell membrane (ESM) is a natural biomaterial that has been used as an alternative natural bandage to cure wounds, and is available in large quantities from egg industries. We have previously demonstrated that processed eggshell membrane powder (PEP), aiming to be used in a low cost wound healing product, possesses anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we further investigated effects of PEP on MMP activities in vitro (a dermal fibroblast cell culture system) and in vivo (a mouse skin wound healing model). Three days incubation with PEP in cell culture led to rearrangement of the actin-cytoskeleton and vinculin in focal adhesions and increased syndecan-4 shedding. In addition, we observed increased matrix metalloproteinase type 2 (MMP-2) enzyme activation, without effects on protein levels of MMP-2 or its regulators (membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type 2 (TIMP-2). Longer incubation (10 days) led to increased protein levels of MMP-2 and its regulators. We also observed an increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) production, suggesting an effect of PEP on myofibroblast differentiation. In vivo, using the mouse skin wound healing model, PEP treatment (3 days) increased MMP activity at the wound edges, along with increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels, and increased keratinocyte cell proliferation. Altogether, our data suggest PEP stimulates MMP activity, and with a positive effect on early cellular events during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2886066317,"Comprised of telomeric TTAGGG repeats and shelterin, telomeres ensure that the natural ends of chromosomes remain impervious to the DNA damage response. Telomeres carry a long constitutive 3′ overhang that can bind replication protein A (RPA) and activate the ATR Ser/Thr kinase (ATR), which induces cell cycle arrest. A single-stranded (ss) TTAGGG repeat–binding protein in mouse shelterin, POT1a, has been proposed to repress ATR signaling by preventing RPA binding. Repression of ATR at telomeres requires tethering of POT1a to the other shelterin subunits situated on the double-stranded (ds) telomeric DNA. The simplest model of ATR repression, the “tethered exclusion model,” suggests that the only critical features of POT1a are its connection to shelterin and its binding to ss telomeric DNA. In agreement with the model, we show here that a shelterin-tethered variant of RPA70 (lacking the ATR recruitment domain) can repress ATR signaling at telomeres that lack POT1a. However, arguing against the tethered exclusion model, the nearly identical POT1b subunit of shelterin has been shown to be much less proficient than POT1a in repression of ATR. We now show that POT1b has the intrinsic ability to fully repress ATR but is prevented from doing so when bound to Ctc1, Stn1, Ten1 (CST), the complex needed for telomere end processing. These results establish that shelterin represses ATR with a tethered ssDNA-binding domain that excludes RPA from the 3′ overhang and also reveal an unexpected effect of CST on the ability of POT1b to repress ATR.

https://openalex.org/W2887920237,"Ectopic epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in facilitating tumorigenesis. Here, we first demonstrated that ANKDD1A is a functional tumor suppressor gene, especially in the hypoxia microenvironment. ANKDD1A directly interacts with FIH1 and inhibits the transcriptional activity of HIF1α by upregulating FIH1. In addition, ANKDD1A decreases the half-life of HIF1α by upregulating FIH1, decreases glucose uptake and lactate production, inhibits glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) autophagy, and induces apoptosis in GBM cells under hypoxia. Moreover, ANKDD1A is highly frequently methylated in GBM. The tumor-specific methylation of ANKDD1A indicates that it could be used as a potential epigenetic biomarker as well as a possible therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2887580371,"Signaling proteins, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), specifically interact with heparan sulfate (HS). These interactions regulate protein distribution and function and are largely mediated by domains rich in basic amino acids. The N-terminal region of BMP2 and BMP4 contains one such domain with a typical Cardin-Weintraub (CW) motif, but it is unclear whether the same occurs in BMP5, BMP6, and BMP7 that constitute a separate evolutionary subgroup. Peptides spanning the N-terminal domain of BMP2/4 interacted with substrate-bound HS with nanomolar affinity, but peptides spanning BMP5/6/7 N-terminal domain did not. We re-examined the entire BMP5/6/7 sequences and identified a novel CW-like motif at their C terminus. Peptides spanning this domain displayed high-affinity HS binding, but corresponding BMP2/4 C-terminal peptides did not, likely because of acidic or noncharged residue substitutions. Peptides pre-assembled into NeutrAvidin tetramers displayed the same exact binding selectivity of respective monomers but bound HS with greater affinity. Tests of possible peptide biological activities showed that the HS-binding N-terminal BMP2/4 and C-terminal BMP5/6/7 peptides stimulated chondrogenesis in vitro, potentially by freeing endogenous BMPs. Thus, HS interactions appear largely ascribable to domains at opposite ends of BMP2/4 versus BMP5/6/7, reiterating the evolutionary distance of these BMP subgroups and possible functional diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2885377566,"Data describing the effect of in vivo B cell depletion on general bone loss in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are limited. Given the pathogenetic role of B cells in RA, it is tempting to speculate that B cell depletion might have a beneficial effect on bone loss. We prospectively investigated the changes in bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, inflammation and disease activity before and after rituximab in 45 RA patients over a 12 month period, 36 patients of whom completed the study and were included in the analysis. There was no significant change in our primary endpoint; lumbar spine BMD after 12 months. However, we found a significant decrease in neck of femur (mean -0.017 g/cm2, 95% CI -0.030, -0.004 p = 0.011) and total femur BMD (mean -0.016 g/cm2, 95% CI -0.025, -0.007 p = 0.001). Additionally, there was a significant increase in procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP); biomarkers of bone formation (median change from baseline to 12 months; P1NP 11.3 μg/L, 95% CI -1.1, 24.8 p = 0.025; BAP 2.5 μg/L, 95% CI 1.2, 3.6 p = 0.002), but no significant change in bone resorption or osteocyte markers. The fall in BMD occurred despite improvement in disease control. Post-menopausal women had the lowest mean lumbar spine, femoral and forearm BMD at baseline and after 12 months, additionally they had a higher level of bone turnover throughout the study. In conclusion, BMD was maintained at the lumbar spine and forearm, but fell at the femur sites. A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was observed and these patients had lower BMD and evidence of higher bone turnover."

It controls the expression of both BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein–interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). Previous studies have demonstrated that in hypoxia, copper is required for the expression of BNIP3 but not for that of IGF2. Here, using ChIP assays, computational analyses, luciferase reporter assays, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we sought to better understand how copper regulates the differential target gene selectivity of HIF-1α. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to CoCl2 or hypoxia conditions to increase HIF-1α accumulation. The binding of HIF-1α to hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) sites in the BNIP3 or IGF2 gene promoter in high- or low-copper conditions was examined. Our analyses revealed three and two potential HRE sites in the BNIP3 and IGF2 promoters, respectively. We identified that HRE (−412/−404) in the BNIP3 promoter and HRE (−354/−347) in the IGF2 promoter are the critical binding sites of HIF-1α. Tetraethelenepentamine (TEPA)-mediated reduction in copper concentration did not affect hypoxia- or CoCl2-induced HIF-1α accumulation.

An important, but as yet incompletely understood, step in the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts is the fusion of osteoclast precursors to form the final differentiated cell. Under physiologic conditions, cells in the osteoblast-osteocyte lineage are thought to be the principal source for RANKL in bone, although it can be made by a variety of cells, including B and T cells (2Yeo L.

Although both RANKL and CSF-1 are required for normal osteoclastogenesis, other cytokines and growth factors contribute to this process (4Miyamoto T.

None of these other factors have been shown to be capable of inducing osteoclastogenesis in the genetic absence of RANKL or CSF-1, but they appear to have important ancillary roles. TNFα and IL-1 are both capable of stimulating osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo and are thought to be important mediators of bone loss associated with inflammatory disorders (5Pfeilschifter J. Chenu C. Bird A. Mundy G.R. Roodman G.D. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor stimulate the formation of human osteoclastlike cells in vitro.J. Bone Miner.

Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) costimulatory molecules Fc receptor γ and DAP12 associate with several cell-surface receptors expressed on osteoclasts and are important for normal osteoclastogenesis to occur (6Koga T.

Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) and osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) have been shown to be critically important to cell–cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis (7Miyamoto H.

The extent and types of cytokines and receptors that contribute to osteoclastogenesis under different physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions likely vary and are at present incompletely understood. One such condition is malignancy-associated bone loss. Osteolysis is an important and serious complication of malignancy. Mechanisms that mediate osteoclastogenesis in malignancy are varied but are thought to mostly involve the RANK–RANKL system as a final common pathway. In certain malignancies, such as myeloma, it appears that cells besides marrow osteoclast precursors, specifically dendritic cells, may serve as cellular precursors for osteoclasts (9Kukreja A. Radfar S. Sun B.H. Insogna K. Dhodapkar M.V. Dominant role of CD47-thrombospondin-1 interactions in myeloma-induced fusion of human dendritic cells: implications for bone disease.Blood. 2009; 114 (19661269): 3413-342110.1182/blood-2009-03-211920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We recently reported that when myeloma cells are cocultured with immature dendritic cells, the dendritic cells transdifferentiate to TRAP-positive bone-resorbing multinucleated giant cells in a process that requires cell–cell contact (9Kukreja A. Radfar S. Sun B.H. Insogna K. Dhodapkar M.V. Dominant role of CD47-thrombospondin-1 interactions in myeloma-induced fusion of human dendritic cells: implications for bone disease.Blood. 2009; 114 (19661269): 3413-342110.1182/blood-2009-03-211920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In these studies, it was observed that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was one of the most significantly up-regulated genes in dendritic cells after coculture with tumor cells. TSP-1 is a multifunctional extracellular glycoprotein that mediates a wide range of intercellular and cell matrix interactions. One of the binding partners for TSP-1, CD47, was found to be highly up-regulated in myeloma cells. The addition of TSP-1 antibody to dendritic cell/myeloma cell cocultures led to significant inhibition of osteoclast formation. Neutralizing TSP-1 also blocked osteoclastogenesis from monocyte osteoclast precursors. Consistent with this latter observation, we showed that parathyroid hormone-induced bone resorption could be markedly attenuated in vivo using the same neutralizing antibody to TSP-1 (9Kukreja A. Radfar S. Sun B.H. Insogna K. Dhodapkar M.V. Dominant role of CD47-thrombospondin-1 interactions in myeloma-induced fusion of human dendritic cells: implications for bone disease.Blood. 2009; 114 (19661269): 3413-342110.1182/blood-2009-03-211920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This last observation indicated a role for TSP-1 in physiologic osteoclastogenesis as well as a possible role in myeloma bone disease. We therefore sought to further characterize the mechanism by which TSP-1 modulates normal osteoclastogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the role of TSP-1 in the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage precursors to mature osteoclasts. In prior studies, we have shown that antibody-mediated blockade of TSP-1 led to inhibition of human osteoclast (OCL) formation when cultures of dendritic cells or monocytes were induced by myeloma cells or RANKL and CSF-1 (9Kukreja A. Radfar S. Sun B.H. Insogna K. Dhodapkar M.V. Dominant role of CD47-thrombospondin-1 interactions in myeloma-induced fusion of human dendritic cells: implications for bone disease.Blood. 2009; 114 (19661269): 3413-342110.1182/blood-2009-03-211920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first analyzed whether this antibody had a similar effect in a murine model of physiologic osteoclastogenesis. During normal bone remodeling, it is thought that cells of the osteoblast lineage induce osteoclastogenesis from marrow precursors through a paracrine signaling cascade in which RANKL produced by osteoblasts engages RANK on osteoclast precursors. The coculture system in which bone marrow cells are cultured with osteoblasts recapitulates in vitro the essential features of normal osteoclastogenesis in vivo (10Insogna K.L. Sahni M. Grey A.B. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Neff L. Mitnick M. Levy J.B. Baron R. Colony-stimulating factor-1 induces cytoskeletal reorganization and c-src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of selected cellular proteins in rodent osteoclasts.J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100 (9366562): 2476-248510.1172/JCI119790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D and prostaglandin E2 are added to the cocultures to induce RANKL expression from osteoblasts. Using this assay, it was observed that neutralizing TSP-1 completely blocked osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1A). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, anti-TSP-1 antibody was added on Days 2, 3, and 5 of the coculture. Panel c quantifies the data from the coculture assay illustrated in Fig. 1A. To determine whether the same findings were observed when murine marrow osteoclast precursors were driven to differentiate with CSF-1 and RANKL, isolated marrow cells were treated with 100 ng/ml RANKL and 100 ng/ml of CSF-1. As shown in Fig. 1B, we also observed complete inhibition of osteoclastogenesis with the neutralizing antibody to TSP-1. Fig. 1B, panel b, quantifies the data from the osteoclastogenesis assay. Together, these data support an important role for TSP-1 in physiologic osteoclastogenesis. Prior studies indicated that CD47 is the TSP-1 binding partner that mediates osteoclast formation (9Kukreja A. Radfar S. Sun B.H. Insogna K. Dhodapkar M.V. Dominant role of CD47-thrombospondin-1 interactions in myeloma-induced fusion of human dendritic cells: implications for bone disease.Blood. 2009; 114 (19661269): 3413-342110.1182/blood-2009-03-211920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CD47 has also been implicated in cell fusion, an essential step in the formation of OCLs from macrophages (11Han X. Sterling H. Chen Y. Saginario C. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Lindberg F.P. Vignery A. CD47, a ligand for the macrophage fusion receptor, participates in macrophage multinucleation.J. Biol.

Osteoclast fusion and regulation by RANKL-dependent and independent factors.World J. Orthop. 2012; 3 (23362465): 212-22210.5312/wjo.v3.i12.212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of CD47 to osteoclastogenesis, WT osteoblasts from C57/BL6j mice were used as the source of osteoblasts so that the genetic absence of CD47 just in osteoclast precursors could be examined. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, panel a, osteoclast precursors from CD47−/− mice still formed osteoclasts when cocultured with WT osteoblasts, although the number of osteoclasts generated and their size were reduced (Fig. 2B). When osteoclast precursors, isolated from CD36−/− or double knockout (DKO) mice, were used in the coculture assay, mature osteoclasts still formed in vitro (Fig. 2A, panels b and c). As was the case when osteoclasts were generated from CD47−/− precursors, treating CD36−/− or DKO cultures with a neutralizing antibody to TSP-1 completely abrogated osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 2A, panels b and c, right-hand columns). Interestingly, osteoclasts formed from CD36−/− preosteoclasts were significantly larger in size than WT osteoclasts (Fig. 2B). Osteoclasts derived from DKO osteoclast precursors were significantly smaller than WT osteoclasts and intermediate in size between CD36−/− osteoclasts and CD47−/− osteoclasts (Fig. 2B). To determine whether these findings extended to a human model of osteoclastogenesis, siRNA was used to suppress expression of CD47 in human peripheral blood monocytes that were differentiated to osteoclast-like cells with RANKL and CSF-1. As shown in Fig. 2C, despite suppression of CD47 expression by nearly 70%, osteoclast formation still occurred, albeit at a reduced level. These data suggest that deficiency of CD47 alone does not fully recapitulate the effects of antibody-mediated blockade of TSP-1 in both murine and human cells. The above data also indicate that CD47 is not solely responsible for mediating the pro-osteoclastogenic action of TSP-1. Initial microarray studies in human monocytes cultured in the presence of RANKL and CSF-1 identified CD36 as one of the top genes up-regulated upon RANKL exposure (data not shown). CD36 is a well known TSP-1 binding partner and is also implicated in cell fusion (13Helming L. Winter J. Gordon S. The scavenger receptor CD36 plays a role in cytokine-induced macrophage fusion.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122 (19155290): 453-45910.1242/jcs.037200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore next decided to evaluate the contribution of CD36 to osteoclastogenesis. Before doing so, we first determined the changes in expression of TSP-1, CD47, and CD36 during osteoclastogenesis. To determine whether the expression of TSP-1, CD47, and CD36 proteins changes as osteoclasts mature, we examined the expression of these molecules in early preosteoclasts and compared it with that of fully mature multinucleated osteoclasts. Specifically, we examined the expression of TSP-1, CD47, and CD36 in freshly isolated murine preosteoclasts (Day 0), early in the differentiation process (Day 2 of treatment with RANKL and CSF-1), and at peak osteoclast formation (which usually occurred on Day 4 of treatment with RANKL and CSF-1). As shown in Fig. 3A, TSP-1 expression was highest at Day 0 and was undetectable thereafter. Similar to TSP-1, expression of CD36 was only detected by Western analyses at Day 0. CD47 was first detected at Day 2 and persisted at Day 4. In addition, we observed that, although cell-surface expression of both CD36 and CD47 was detected in preosteoclasts, both disappeared from the surface of mature osteoclasts. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4, A and B, there was abundant expression of CD47 and CD36 on osteoclast precursors but no expression of either of these molecules on the surface of mature, freshly isolated osteoclasts, indicating that the level of expression and the cellular distribution of these two molecules were altered during osteoclastogenesis.Figure 4.Cell-surface expression of CD47 and CD36 changes during osteoclastogenesis.

IF, immunofluorescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next sought to clarify the cellular sources of TSP-1, CD36, and CD47 in our model systems. As noted earlier, the coculture system most faithfully recapitulates the in vivo circumstance in which osteoblast/stromal cells support osteoclastogenesis by elaborating a variety of cytokines, most importantly RANKL and CSF-1. As shown in Fig. 3A, TSP-1, CD36, and CD47 were all detectable by Western blot analysis in osteoclast precursors early in differentiation. In primary murine osteoblasts (Fig. 3B), we also detected the expression of CD47. However, neither TSP-1 nor CD36 was expressed in osteoblasts. To directly examine the contribution of CD36 to osteoclastogenesis, we used a selective peptide agonist for CD36, p907 (14Isenberg J.S. Jia Y. Fukuyama J. Switzer C.H. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Thrombospondin-1 inhibits nitric oxide signaling via CD36 by inhibiting myristic acid uptake.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5A, panels a and b, adding p907 to murine cocultures treated with anti-TSP-1 antibody restored osteoclastogenesis. Adding p907 or IgG alone to murine cocultures did not significantly influence the number of osteoclasts formed (Fig. 5A, third and fourth panels, respectively). In osteoclastogenesis experiments using human monocytes as precursors, suppressing CD36 inhibited osteoclastogenesis as shown in Fig. 5B. As shown in Fig. 5C, suppressing CD36 in human monocytes abrogated the ability of p907 to rescue the inhibitory effect of anti-TSP-1 on osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, p907 was still able to rescue the inhibitory effect of the anti-TSP-1 antibody on osteoclastogenesis when expression of CD47 was suppressed with an siRNA (Fig. 5D). Together, these data identify CD36 as a hitherto unappreciated but important participant in regulating TSP-1–mediated osteoclastogenesis. CD36 is known to suppress nitric oxide generation (14Isenberg J.S. Jia Y. Fukuyama J. Switzer C.H. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Thrombospondin-1 inhibits nitric oxide signaling via CD36 by inhibiting myristic acid uptake.J. Biol.

Suppression of nitric oxide generation has been previously reported to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (15Kasten T.P. Collin-Osdoby P. Patel N. Osdoby P. Krukowski M. Misko T.P. Settle S.L. Currie M.G. Nickols G.A. Potentiation of osteoclast bone-resorption activity by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We consequently determined whether part of the mechanism by which TSP-1 acts was via a nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. As shown in Fig. 6A, when neutralizing antibody to TSP-1 was added to murine cocultures on Day 5, just before osteoclasts appear in the cultures, there was a time-dependent, significant increase in the amount of nitric oxide accumulating in the cell layer. In concert with the increase in NO production, neutralizing TSP-1 in the same cultures led to a significant increase in cGMP generation (Fig. 6B). These data are consistent with the idea that TSP-1 suppresses nitric oxide and cGMP production as part of its pro-osteoclastogenic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we treated murine cocultures with the neutralizing antibody to TSP-1 and l-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME), which was added at a final concentration of 100 nm. As shown in Fig. 6C, panel a, adding l-NAME to murine cocultures treated with antibody to TSP-1 completely rescued osteoclastogenesis. Fig. 6C, panel b, quantifies the data in panel a. To determine whether the effects of anti-TSP-1 to increase nitric oxide synthesis and cGMP were central to its anti-osteoclastogenic actions, we determined whether addition of the CD36 activator p907 would suppress anti-TSP-1–induced nitric oxide production. As shown in Fig. 6D, the induction of nitric oxide by the neutralizing antibody to TSP-1 was substantially suppressed by the addition of p907, although it did not suppress NO production to the level seen in the cultures treated with isotype-matched control antibody. The above data indicate a role for both CD36 and CD47 in mediating the pro-osteoclastogenic effects of TSP-1. Our prior in vivo studies established a role for TSP-1 in contributing to the hypercalcemia induced by continuous PTH infusion. However, the acceptor molecules responsible for mediating the effects of TSP-1 in vivo were not clarified by that result. We hypothesized that both CD36 and CD47 mediate the actions of TSP, and, therefore, in the genetic absence of both molecules, the hypercalcemic response to PTH would also be attenuated. To directly test this hypothesis, we generated animals in which both CD36 and CD47 were genetically deleted and infused them with PTH as described under “Experimental procedures.” In these experiments, only female animals were studied. Because generating the DKO mice required breeding CD36−/− and CD47−/− mice, we were able to separately analyze the skeletal phenotype of these animals. The deletion of only CD36 or CD47 in vivo led to somewhat divergent phenotypes. There was no significant change in trabecular bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV) or trabecular thickness in the CD47−/− mice. Trabecular BV/TV refers to the percentage of mineralized tissue in the total tissue volume analyzed in the trabecular compartment. Trabecular number was increased, whereas trabecular spacing was reduced in the CD47−/− mice (Fig. 7). Surprisingly, cortical BV/TV and thickness were both significantly reduced in CD47−/− mice (Fig. 8). The phenotype of the CD36−/− animals was more pronounced. Trabecular BV/TV, trabecular thickness (Fig. 7), and cortical BV/TV (Fig. 8) were all significantly higher in the CD36−/− animals. Surprisingly, trabecular number was reduced, and trabecular spacing was increased (Fig. 7). Compared with controls, there were no significant differences in body weight in either the CD36−/− or CD47−/− mice.Figure 8.Mice in which CD47, CD36, or both CD36 and CD47 (DKO) are genetically deleted have altered femoral cortical bone mass or cortical parameters. Mean bone density was determined by micro-CT in 12-week-old female CD47−/−, CD36−/−, and DKO mice and 12-week-old female WT controls. In CD47−/− mice, cortical bone volume and cortical thickness were both significantly reduced (n = 10 for WT and n = 5 for CD47−/− mice; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p < 0.0001; NS, nonsignificant). Cortical bone mass was significantly increased in the CD36−/− mice (n = 10 for WT and n = 11 for CD36−/−; **, p < 0.01; NS, nonsignificant). Cortical thickness was significantly reduced, and endosteal circumference was significantly increased in the DKO mice. Because periosteal circumference did not change but endosteal circumference increased, per force cortical thickness was reduced (n = 10 for WT and n = 8 for DKO; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005; NS, nonsignificant). The scatter plots represent mean ± S.D. (error bars).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The phenotype of the DKO mice reflected the differing skeletal changes observed in the CD36−/− and CD47−/− animals. Thus, trabecular BV/TV tended to be higher with an accompanying significant increase in trabecular number and a significant decrease in trabecular spacing (Fig. 7). There was no change in cortical BV/TV in the DKO animals (Fig. 8). These data are consistent with a role for both CD47 and CD36 in regulating skeletal homeostasis, likely, in part, by modulating the actions of TSP-1 in bone. In keeping with that notion, TSP-1 knockout mice have been reported to have a low bone density (18Amend S.R. Uluckan O. Hurchla M. Leib D. Novack D.V. Silva M. Frazier W. Weilbaecher K.N.

As described in the Introduction, we postulated that TSP-1, acting through CD47 and CD36, participates in the bone resorptive response to a PTH infusion. Consistent with this hypothesis, when female DKO animals were infused with PTH, serum C-terminal type 1 collagen cross-links (CTx) and serum calcium were both significantly lower in the double knockout animals as compared with controls.

https://openalex.org/W2885271663,"The Set4 protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains both a PHD finger and a SET domain, a common signature of chromatin-associated proteins, and shares sequence homology with the yeast protein Set3, the fly protein UpSET, and the human protein mixed-lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5). However, the biological role for Set4 and its potential function in chromatin regulation has not been well defined. Here, we analyzed yeast cell phenotypes associated with loss of Set4 or its overexpression, which revealed that Set4 protects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Gene expression analysis indicated that Set4 promotes the activation of stress response genes in the presence of oxidative insults. Using ChIP analysis and other biochemical assays, we also found that Set4 interacts with chromatin and directly localizes to stress response genes upon oxidative stress. However, recombinant Set4 did not show detectable methyltransferase activity on histones. Our findings also suggest that Set4 abundance in the cell is balanced under normal and stress conditions to promote survival. Overall, these results suggest a model in which Set4 is a stress-responsive, chromatin-associated protein that activates gene expression programs required for cellular protection against oxidative stress. This work advances our understanding of mechanisms that protect cells during oxidative stress and further defines the role of the Set3–Set4 subfamily of SET domain–containing proteins in controlling gene expression in response to adverse environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2885799105,"Autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm with high biomass production; however, low fertility is the main barrier in commercial utilization. In our previous study, differential expression of meiosis-related miRNAs was found to be involved in the pollen sterility of autotetraploid rice. However, genome-wide DNA variations and methylomes associated with low fertility of autotetraploid rice are still poorly understood. Here, we measured both global DNA variations and the methylome and compared them with the transcriptome during pollen development in autotetraploid rice by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 34416 SNPs, 6993 InDels, 1003 SVs and 25 CNVs were detected, and 11367 and 41117 differentially methylated regions showed hypermethylation and hypomethylation in 02428-4x. In total, 1110 genes displayed differentially expression in 02428-4x during meiosis, of these six harbored CNVs, including four upregulated genes with gain CNVs, such as LOC_Os11g38620. We identified 122 genes by comparing with the previous data that might be associated with low fertility during pollen development in 02428-4x. Of the 122 gens, 98 were displayed methylation and differential expression, including OsMADS98, CYP703A3 and OsABCG26. The downregulation of these three genes were confirmed by qPCR during meiosis of 02428-4x, which played pivotal roles in pollen fertility. These results indicate that the low fertility of autotetraploid rice is not only caused by the differential expression of genes involved in pollen development, but also by sequence variation and differential methylation, suggesting that the reason for pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice is complex and might be affected by multiple factors."
https://openalex.org/W2887162196,"Primary glioblastoma is the most frequent human brain tumor in adults and is generally fatal due to tumor recurrence. We previously demonstrated that glioblastoma-initiating cells invade the subventricular zones and promote their radio-resistance in response to the local release of the CXCL12 chemokine. In this work, we show that the mitotic Aurora A kinase (AurA) is activated through the CXCL12–CXCR4 pathway in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. Moreover, the CXCL12–ERK1/2 signaling induces the expression of Ajuba, the main cofactor of AurA, which allows the auto-phosphorylation of AurA. We show that AurA contributes to glioblastoma cell survival, radio-resistance, self-renewal, and proliferation regardless of the exogenous stimulation with CXCL12. On the other hand, AurA triggers the CXCL12-mediated migration of glioblastoma cells in vitro as well as the invasion of the subventricular zone in xenograft experiments. Moreover, AurA regulates cytoskeletal proteins (i.e., Actin and Vimentin) and favors the pro-migratory activity of the Rho-GTPase CDC42 in response to CXCL12. Altogether, these results show that AurA, a well-known kinase of the mitotic machinery, may play alternative roles in human glioblastoma according to the CXCL12 concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2887392745,"Dengue virus has shown a complex pattern of transmission across Latin America over the last two decades. In an attempt to explain the permanence of the disease in regions subjected to drought seasons lasting over six months, various hypotheses have been proposed. These include transovarial transmission, forest reservoirs and asymptomatic human virus carriers. Dengue virus is endemic in Mexico, a country in which half of the population is seropositive. Seropositivity is a risk factor for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever upon a second encounter with the dengue virus. Since Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever can cause death, it is important to develop epidemiological mathematical tools that enable policy makers to predict regions potentially at risk for a dengue epidemic. We formulated a mathematical model of dengue transmission, considering both human behavior and environmental conditions pertinent to the transmission of the disease. When data on past human population density, temperature and rainfall were entered into this model, it provided an accurate picture of the actual spread of dengue over recent years in four states (representing two climactic conditions) in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2885949441,"Cancer is one of the most troublesome diseases and a leading cause of death worldwide. Recently, novel treatments have been continuously developed to improve the disadvantages of conventional therapies, such as prodigious expenses, unwanted side effects, and tumor recurrence. Here, we provide the first non-invasive treatment that has combined epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, with a low strength pulsed electric field (PEF) and a low energy ultrasound (US). It has been observed that the cell viability of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 was decreased approximately to 20% of the control after this combination treatment for 72 h. Besides, the combined triple treatment significantly reduced the high tolerance of HepG2 cells to the EGCG-induced cytotoxicity and similarly exhibited compelling proliferation-inhibitory effects. We also found the combined triple treatment increased the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acidic vesicles, and the EGCG-induced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was dramatically intensified. In this study, the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA were, respectively, shown to attenuate the anticancer effects of the triple treatment. This indicates that the triple treatment-induced autophagy was switched from cytoprotective to cytotoxic, and hence, cooperatively caused cell death with the apoptosis. Since the EGCG is easily accessible from the green tea and mild for a long-term treatment, and the non-invasive physical stimulations could be modified to focus on a specific location, this combined triple treatment may serve as a promising strategy for anticancer therapy."

The structural and functional effects of m-domain phosphorylation have often been inferred from those of the corresponding serine-to-aspartate (Ser–Asp) substitutions, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Here, using a combination of in vitro binding assays and in situ structural and functional assays in ventricular trabeculae of rat heart and the expressed C1mC2 region of cMyBP-C, containing the m-domain flanked by domains C1 and C2, we tested whether these substitutions do in fact mimic the effects of phosphorylation. In situ changes in thin and thick filament structure were determined from changes in polarized fluorescence from bifunctional probes attached to troponin C or myosin regulatory light chain, respectively. We show that both the action of exogenous C1mC2 to activate contraction in the absence of calcium and the accompanying change in thin filament structure are abolished by tris-phosphorylation of the m-domain, but unaffected by the corresponding Ser–Asp substitutions. The latter produced an intermediate change in thick filament structure. Both tris-phosphorylation and Ser–Asp substitutions abolished the interaction between C1mC2 and myosin sub-fragment 2 (myosin S2) in vitro, but yielded different effects on thin filament binding. These results suggest that some previous inferences from the effects of Ser–Asp substitutions in cMyBP-C should be reconsidered and that the distinct effects of tris-phosphorylation and Ser–Asp substitutions on cMyBP-C may provide a useful basis for future studies.

In addition, the moderating effects of received and provided support with respect to the above-mentioned relationship were investigated.Study participants completed the following psychometric inventories: the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and the Berlin Social Support Scales (BSSS). Three assessments were performed: 129 patients were recruited for the first assessment, 106 patients agreed to participate in the second assessment, and 82 of the initial 129 participants (63.6%) participated in all three assessments.An indirect association between PTG and positive affect was observed. However, no association was found between PTG and negative affect. Received support, but not provided support, completely moderated the relationship between PTG and positive affect.This study adds to the literature by examining the temporal relationship between PTG and affective-wellbeing among PLWH. It appears from the results that in this patient group, PTG may enhance the positive affect over time. However, receiving support is vital in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2886518099,"Background Malaria remains a leading cause of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Identifying patients who are at risk for severe manifestations at presentation still remains challenging. This study examines whether a semi-quantitative test on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) could be useful for rapidly predicting the presence or absence of malarial parasitemia in febrile children. Method Data were collected from children with fever or a history of fever at the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Haematological measurements, microscopic detection of plasmodium species and semi-quantitative CRP measurements with a membrane–based immunoassay for whole blood were performed. CRP was classified as positive when the measured level was ≥ 10 mg/l. Results During 548 visits, thick blood film results could be obtained from 541 patients, 270 (49.3%) yielded parasitemia with Plasmodium spp. Whereas malaria parasites were detected in only a few patients (7.1%) with normal CRP levels (< 10mg/l), more than a half of patients with an increased CRP concentration (≥ 10 mg/l) were parasite positive (OR 14.5 [CI 4.4–47.6], p<0.001). Patients with increased CRP levels had more than an eight-fold likelihood for parasitemia after correction for other parameters (adjusted OR 8.7 [CI 2.5–30.5], p<0.001). Sensitivity, specificity as well as positive predictive and negative predictive values of CRP for malaria were 99.3% (CI 96.2%-100%), 9.2% (CI 6.4%-12.8%), 31.7% (CI 27.4%-36.1%) and 97.0% (CI 84.2%-99.9%), respectively. Conclusion The semi-quantitative method of measuring CRP is cheap, rapid and easy to perform but not useful in predicting parasitemia and malaria. However, due to its high negative predictive value, it could have a role in identifying those patients unlikely to be presenting with clinical malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2885666871,"Background Scientific evidence indicates that high dietary salt intake has detrimental effects on blood pressure and associated cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, limited information is available on how to implement salt reduction in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as India, where the burden of hypertension and CVD is increasing rapidly. As part of a large study to create the evidence base required to develop a salt reduction strategy for India, we assessed the perspectives of various stakeholders regarding developing an India specific salt reduction strategy. Methods A qualitative research design was deployed to elicit various stakeholder’s (government and policy-related stakeholders, industry, civil Society, consumers) perspectives on a salt reduction strategy for India, using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). We used an inductive approach for data analysis. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis method. Results Forty-two IDIs and eight FGDs were conducted with various stakeholders of interest and relevance. Analysis indicated three major themes: 1. Barriers for salt reduction 2. Facilitators for salt reduction; 3. Strategies for salt reduction. Most of the stakeholders were in alignment with the need for a salt reduction programme in India to prevent and control hypertension and related CVD. Major barriers indicated by the stakeholders for salt reduction in India were social and cultural beliefs, a large unorganized food retail sector, and the lack of proper implementation of even existing food policies. Stakeholders from the food industry reported that there might be decreased sales due to salt reduction. Major facilitators included the fact that: salt reduction is currently a part of the National Multi-Sectoral Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs, salt reduction and salt iodine programme are compatible, and that few of the multinational food companies have already started working in the direction of initiating efforts for salt reduction. Based on the barriers and facilitators, few of the recommendations are to generate awareness among consumers, promote salt reduction by processed food industry, and implement consumer friendly food labelling. Conclusions In this study of multiple key influential stakeholders in India, most of the stakeholders were in alignment with the need for a salt reduction programme in India to prevent and control hypertension and related CVD. The development and adoption of the National Multi-sectoral Action Plan to reduce premature non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in India, provides a potential platform that can be leveraged to drive, implement and monitor salt reduction efforts."

The SUMO family (SUMO1–4) consists of small 10-kDa proteins that are conjugated to lysine residues in their target proteins using an enzymatic pathway consisting of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, which resembles that of ubiquitinylation. SUMO1 is only 45% identical to SUMO2 and SUMO3, whereas the latter two are almost identical and are functionally undistinguishable. The vast majority of SUMO1 exists in conjugated species, whereas a free pool of SUMO2/3 species is usually found in cells.

Several chromatin-related mechanisms have been proposed to explain the repressive effect observed for a large number of factors as a consequence of their SUMOylation. SUMO appears to recruit a diversity of chromatin-modifying enzymes and chromatin-associated proteins, including the histone deacetylase HDAC2, the histone demethylase LSD1, the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, the nucleosome remodeling ATPase Mi-2, and chromatin-associated proteins HP1, L3MBTL1, and L3MBTL2 (25Ouyang J.

It has been proposed that SUMO sets up a local repressive heterochromatin (26Stielow B. Sapetschnig A. Wink C. Krüger I. Suske G.

Even if this process is only partially understood, we know even less when it comes to how this repression is abolished or relieved. The dampening effect of SUMOylation implies that in many cases relief from SUMO repression may represent an important contribution to the transcriptional activation caused by a transcription factor. In this work, we focus on SUMO-proteases as putative players in gene activation. We reasoned that their role in gene activation might be clarified through their interactome. By screening for interaction partners of SENP1, we identified the chromodomain helicase DNA–binding protein 3 (CHD3), implicating a novel link between deSUMOylation and chromatin remodeling. We used CRISPR-Cas9–generated KO cells in combination with ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to uncover a functional link between the two proteins. As a first step toward finding novel gene activation mechanisms dependent on SENP1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human thymus cDNA library using a centromeric bait-plasmid to identify partners of SENP1. Even at the low expression level achieved with our single copy CEN-plasmid approach, SENP1 turned out to be toxic to yeast cells precluding ordinary screening (Fig. 1A). However, by using a protease-dead mutant of SENP1 (C603S), the toxic effects were minor, and we were able to perform a screening of 6 × 107 clones, of which 92 positive grew on various selective media. We sequenced the cDNA of 40 of the clones with the strongest blue color on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-Gal) plates. The interaction between SENP1 and selected prey was verified in yeast by retransformation and growth on reporter-selective media (Fig. 1B). Among the cDNAs with highest frequency in this screening, we found the chromatin remodeler CHD3 (Figs. 1B and 2A), which we selected for further studies because we thought CHD3 may represent an interesting novel link between the SUMO system, chromatin remodeling, and transcription.Figure 2.CHD3 interacts with SENP1. A, human CHD3 and SENP1 are depicted with their domain structures. B–E, GST pulldown binding assays were performed with different GST protein domains and 3×FLAG–CHD3 from transfected COS-1 cells. The GST fusion proteins used were full length versions of SENP1 (panel B), and the indicated deletions of SENP1 (panels C, D, and E). In panels B, C, and D, binding of the GST proteins to full-length CHD3 was monitored, while binding to deletions of 3×FLAG-CHD3 was monitored in panel E. 24 h after transfection, the COS-1 cells were lysed in KAc-interaction buffer, and the lysates were incubated with comparable amounts of the different GST fusion proteins bound to GSH beads. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the immunoblot was analyzed using anti-FLAG antibody (1:10,000) and LI-COR IRDye 680RD anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000). 5% of total cell extract used for each pulldown was loaded as reference. The upper panels show the Western blots (anti-FLAG) for CHD3, and the lower panel shows the Coomassie-stained gel of the indicated GST fusion proteins. B and C are derived from the same experiment and the same gel with the common input and GST controls placed in the middle. Therefore, the controls of B are re-used in C. F, co-immunoprecipitation of SENP1 with CHD3. COS-1 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of pCIneo-3×FLAG-SENP1 and pEF1–3×Ty1–CHD3. Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Ty1 antibody and separated by SDS-PAGE, and SENP1 was revealed by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-FLAG antibody. 5% of total transfected cell lysate was loaded as input reference. G, co-immunoprecipitation at endogenous levels of SENP1 with 3×Ty1–CHD3. The K562 nuclear extract from 3×Ty1–CHD3 (clone H6) was incubated with protein A magnetic beads coupled to an anti-Ty1 mAb (right). A nuclear extract from a 3×Ty1–Empty stable K562 cell line served as control (left). From a measure of the pixels in the bands in the upper panel, we estimated that in the right part from 3×Ty1–CHD3-expressing cells, 1.7% of the total input with endogenous SENP1 was found in the anti-Ty1 precipitate (pixels in 4th lane = 17% in 3rd lane). This is in contrast to the left control pair from 3×Ty1 empty cells where the co-IP band was only 0.01% of the total input. H, change in fluorescence anisotropy of SUMO1–AMC in complex with increasing amounts of recombinant full-length CHD3–(1994-SIMmutant) in the absence (binary complex) or presence (ternary complex) of recombinant SENP1-(C603S)(297–644). The anisotropy values were measured in the presence and absence of added protein, and the difference was plotted as indicated. In the ternary complex binding curve, the fixed concentration of SENP1-(C603S)(297–644) was 580 pm. This fixed concentration of SENP1 used for the ternary complex curve was based on a separate titration of SENP1-(C603S)(297–644) to SUMO1–AMC, where a concentration of SENP1 well below saturation was selected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) But before we embarked on a further analysis, given that the interaction was observed in yeast cells, we performed size fractionation of nuclear extracts from K562 cells. Using Superose-6 fractionation of nuclear extracts from a derived K562 cell line expressing 3×Ty1-tagged CHD3 and a control cell line, we observed in both cases that endogenous SENP1 migrated in high-molecular weight fractions supporting its association with larger proteins or complexes (Fig. 1, C and D). CHD3 eluted as a high-molecular weight complex as expected from its association with NuRD-type complexes (28Lai A.Y. Wade P.A. Cancer biology and NuRD: a multifaceted chromatin remodeling complex.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11 (21734722): 588-59610.1038/nrc3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction between SENP1 and CHD3 by independent methods, we first performed GST-pulldown assays using full-length GST–SENP1 WT and C603S mutant. The purified fusion proteins were incubated with lysate from COS-1 cells transfected with an expression plasmid for full-length CHD3. As shown in Fig. 2B, CHD3 was retained on GST–SENP1 (WT and mutant) but not on the GST control. To map in more detail the interacting regions, we performed GST pulldown assays with deletion constructs of both SENP1 and CHD3. The catalytic domain of SENP1(297–644) bound more strongly to CHD3 than its N-terminal regions (amino acids 1–296) (Fig. 2C). It appears that the minimal catalytic domain of SENP1(416–644) is sufficient for strong interaction of SENP1 with CHD3 (Fig. 2D). When GST fusions of SENP1(297–644) were used to retain subdomains of CHD3 expressed in COS-1 cells, we observed more than one region of CHD3 binding to SENP1. Both the N-terminal domain (CHD3(1–324)), the PHD-chromodomain region (CHD3(308–708)) and the C-terminal CTD-region (CHD3(1655–2000)) were retained by GST–SENP1(297–644) (Fig. 2E). In contrast, the central ATPase domain of CHD3(709–1217) and the DUF region of CHD3(1218–1654) showed no affinity for SENP1. An additional line of evidence for the CHD3-SENP1 interaction was provided by co-immunoprecipitation assays, first using lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with 3×FLAG-SENP1 and 3×Ty1–CHD3. As shown in Fig. 2F, SENP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with CHD3 (anti-Ty1 antibody). Control transfections indicated that this interaction is specific. We then used a K562 cell line stably expressing 3×Ty1–CHD3 to perform co-immunoprecipitation assays under more stringent, semi-endogenous conditions. In K562 nuclear extracts from this stable cell line, endogenous SENP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with CHD3 as revealed by a polyclonal rabbit anti-SENP1 antibody (Fig. 2G). The level of expression of 3×Ty1–CHD3 in this stable cell line was close to the endogenous level of CHD3 in the parental K562 cells, supporting an interaction at physiological levels of both SENP1 and CHD3 (Fig. S1). Fluorescence anisotropy experiments with a fluorescently labeled SUMO1 (SUMO1–AMC) gave evidence for the formation of a CHD3–SENP1–SUMO1 ternary complex in solution (Fig. 2H). CHD3 has been reported to bind SUMO1 (29Goodarzi A.A. Kurka T. Jeggo P.A. KAP-1 phosphorylation regulates CHD3 nucleosome remodeling during the DNA double-strand break response.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 (21642969): 831-83910.1038/nsmb.2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Hence, we monitored the binding of SUMO1–AMC to CHD3 as fluorescence anisotropy. Upon increasing concentrations of CHD3, we observed the expected change in anisotropy (Fig. 2H). If CHD3 in addition were binding to SENP1, we expected an increase in anisotropy because of the increased size of the ternary complex. To avoid too strong a binding of SUMO1 to CHD3, we made use of a CHD3 mutant where its SUMO interaction motif close to its C terminus was mutated (amino acid positions 1994–1997 changed from VICI to AACA). We also used a catalytic dead mutant of SENP1 (C603S) to avoid cleavage of the AMC fluorophore under these conditions, and we used only the catalytic domain of SENP1(297–644), binding CHD3 strongly (Fig. 2C). The shift in the CHD3-titration curve upon addition of a fixed amount of SENP1 suggests that SUMO1–AMC was binding to a larger complex when CHD3 and SENP1 were combined compared to when CHD3 was titrated alone, supporting the interaction of the two proteins in solution. Because CHD3 operates on chromatin, we tested whether the remodeler was able to recruit SENP1 to chromatin. For this purpose, we performed ChIP experiments in the HEK293-c1 cell line (26Stielow B. Sapetschnig A. Wink C. Krüger I. Suske G. SUMO-modified Sp3 represses transcription by provoking local heterochromatic gene silencing.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 (18617891): 899-90610.1038/embor.2008.127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) transfected with a Gal–CHD3 fusion and monitored the occupancy of SENP1 both at the Gal–CHD3-bound site (5×Gal4 response-element promoter) and at a more distant locus (NCOA5 intron) serving as background reference. SENP1 was not recruited to any of these sites in the presence of the control Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) only. However, in presence of the Gal–CHD3 fusion protein, which becomes directed to the Gal4-responsive promoter, the recruitment of SENP1 was evident (Fig. 3). These observations are in line with the interaction experiments and consistent with the hypothesis that SENP1 and CHD3 interact in a chromatin context where SENP1 becomes recruited to chromatin-associated CHD3. Taken together, these independent interaction assays all supported the validity of an interaction between SENP1 and CHD3 both in vitro and in vivo involving the catalytic domain of SENP1 and regions of CHD3. To address the functional implications of the interaction between SENP1 and CHD3, we focused first on the effects on chromatin features. We reasoned that because CHD3 is a chromatin remodeler, the accessibility of some loci should be affected by loss of CHD3. Furthermore, if CHD3 and SENP1 interact in a way that affects the function of CHD3, there should also be some shared loci where accessibility is affected by loss of each of the two proteins. For this purpose, we made use of HAP1 cells in which the genes for either SENP1 or CHD3 were inactivated by CRISPR-Cas9–generated frameshift mutations into the coding sequence of the respective genes. HAP1 is a near-haploid human cell line that was derived from the male chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line KBM-7 (30Carette J.E. Raaben M. Wong A.C. Herbert A.S. Obernosterer G. Mulherkar N.

The characterization of the KO cell lines showed that they both lacked the full-length proteins (Fig. S2). However, they appear to express a reduced amount of a truncated protein (20% for the truncated CHD3, less for the truncated"
https://openalex.org/W2887230342,"Oligomeric forms of the Aβ peptide represent the most probable neurotoxic agent in Alzheimer’s disease. The dynamic and heterogeneous character of these oligomers makes their structural characterization by classic methods difficult. Native mass spectrometry, when supported by additional gas phase techniques, like ion mobility separation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (IM-HDX-MS), enable analysis of different oligomers coexisting in the sample and may provide species-specific structural information for each oligomeric form populated in the gas phase. Here, we have combined these three techniques to obtain insight into the structural properties of oligomers of Aβ1–40 and two variants with scrambled sequences. Gas-phase HDX-MS revealed a sequence-specific engagement of the side-chains of residues located at the N-terminal part of the peptide in a network of oligomer-stabilizing interactions. Oligomer-specific interactions were no longer observed in the case of the fully scrambled sequence. Also, the ability to form alternative structures, observed for WT Aβ peptide, was lost upon scrambling. Our data underscore a role for the N-terminal residues in shaping the equilibria of oligomeric forms. Although the peptide lacking the N-terminal 1–16 residues (p3 peptide) is thought to be benign, the role of the N-terminus has not been sufficiently characterized yet. We speculate that the interaction networks revealed here may be crucial for enabling structural transitions necessary to obtain mature parallel cross-β structures from smaller antiparallel oligomers. We provide a hypothetical molecular model of the trajectory that allows a gradual conversion from antiparallel to parallel oligomers without decomposition of oligomers. Oligomer-defining interactions involving the Aβ peptide N-terminus may be important in production of the neurotoxic forms and thus should not be neglected."

Although the progesterone receptor (PgR) is also a prognostic factor for ER-positive breast cancer, the PgR status was not considered a prognostic factor in the original PEPI scoring system. In this study, we investigated the utility of a modified PEPI including the PgR status (PEPI-P) as a prognostic factor after NAE for postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. We enrolled 107 patients with invasive ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer treated with exemestane for ≥4 months as NAE. We initially assessed PEPI and compared survival between the groups. Additionally, we obtained an effective cutoff for PgR through survival analysis. Then, we assessed the survival significance of PEPI-P. A PgR staining rate of 50% was the most significant cutoff for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). PEPI was a significant prognostic factor; moreover, PEPI-P was the most significant prognostic indicator for RFS and CSS. PEPI-P is a potent prognostic indicator of survival after NAE using AIs for postmenopausal patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. This modified PEPI may be useful for therapeutic decision-making regarding postmenopausal ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer after NAE."

https://openalex.org/W2885060959,"Objective The analgesic effect of music has been recognized for pain relief, but individual differences and adjuvant methods are poorly understood. This study employed a cold-pressor task (CPT) to observe the effects of music (without considering personal preferences) on pain experience and how this is affected by individuals’ general (and pain-specific) anxiety symptomology. Methods Fifty participants were each presented with three conditions (randomized into different orders): music-listening, news-listening, and no sound (control). Pain responses, including pain tolerance time (PT), pain intensity (PI), and pain unpleasantness (PU), were assessed using CPT and compared with a 3x3 crossover design. Participants also completed the anxiety sensitivity index (ASI-16) and pain anxiety symptom scale (PASS-20). Results CPT pain responses during the music intervention were significantly different from responses during the news intervention and control conditions, respectively. Among participants with normal anxiety levels, pain responses during the music condition differed significantly from the news and control groups; this was not the case for the anxiety risk group. Pain responses during the music condition for those with normal levels of pain-specific anxiety differed significantly from the control, but this was not the case for the risk group. Conclusions Music appears to influence diminished pain responses relative to the absence of an intervention. However, this was not the case when individuals listened to news stories. These effects were more robust for individuals experiencing normal levels of general and pain-specific anxiety. Thus, music (even outside one’s own preferences) was an effective adjuvant method for managing pain, especially among those without significant anxiety symptomology."
https://openalex.org/W2885865836,"The venereal diseases bovine trichomoniasis (BT) and bovine genital campylobacteriosis (BGC) cause economic losses in endemic areas like La Pampa province in Argentina where beef cattle are usually extensively managed. This study used data compiled between 2007 and 2014 by a Provincial Program for the Control and Eradication of venereal diseases in order to develop and analyze retrospective models of time series for BT and BGC. Seasonality and long-term trend were explored with decomposition and simple regression methods. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models (ARIMA) were used to fit univariate models for the prevalence and persistence of BT and BGC. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable models (ARIMAX) were used to analyze the association between different time series, replacement entries and herd samplings. The prevalence and persistence of BT and BGC have decreased from 2007 to 2014. All the BT and BGC time series are seasonal and their long-term trend is decreasing. Seasonality of BT and BGC is similar, with higher rates of detection in autumn-winter than is spring-summer. Prevalence and persistence time series are correlated, indicating their changes are synchronic and follow a similar time pattern. Prevalence of BT and BGC showed the best fitting with the ARIMA (0,0,1)(0,1,1)12 model. While for persistence of BT and BGC, the best adjustment was with the same model with no seasonal difference where the current number of cases depends on the moving averages of the month and the previous season. Including covariates improve the fitting of univariate models, in addition, estimations using ARIMAX models are more precise than using ARIMA models. The time distribution of the samplings could be increasing the false negative ratio. According to the obtained results, the ARIMA and ARIMAX models can be considered an option to predict the BT and BGC prevalence and persistence in La Pampa (Argentina)."

Three dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis offers additional outcome measures including internal-external rotation not characterized using sagittal plane (2D) analysis techniques.The objectives of this study were to 1) develop and evaluate a 3D hind limb multiplane kinematic model for gait analysis in cats using joint coordinate systems, 2) implement and compare two 3D stifle (knee) prediction techniques, and 3) compare flexion-extension determined using the multiplane model to a sagittal plane model. Walking gait was recorded in 3 female adult cats (age = 2.9 years, weight = 3.5 ± 0.2 kg). Kinematic outcomes included flexion-extension, internal-external rotation, and abduction-adduction of the hip, stifle, and tarsal (ankle) joints.Each multiplane stifle prediction technique yielded similar findings. Joint angles determined using markers placed on skin above bony landmarks in vivo were similar to joint angles determined using a feline hind limb skeleton in which markers were placed directly on landmarks ex vivo. Differences in hip, stifle, and tarsal joint flexion-extension were demonstrated when comparing the multiplane model to the sagittal plane model.This multiplane cat kinematic model can predict joint rotational kinematics as a tool that can quantify frontal, transverse, and sagittal plane motion. This model has multiple advantages given its ability to characterize joint internal-external rotation and abduction-adduction. A further, important benefit is greater accuracy in representing joint flexion-extension movements."
https://openalex.org/W2887059009,"Performance of dairy cows can be influenced by early life nutrient supply. Adipose tissue is diet sensitive and an important component in that process as it is involved in the regulation of energetic, reproductive and immunological functions. However, it is not clear how early life nutrition alters the molecular regulation of adipose tissue in calves and potentially adult individuals. This study aimed at determining how differences in pre-weaning nutrient supply alter gene expression profiles and physiology in omental adipose tissue. A total of 12 female Holstein calves were fed two levels of milk replacer supply: a restricted amount of 11.72 MJ of metabolizable energy (ME) intake per day (n = 6) or an enhanced amount of 1.26 MJ ME intake per kg of metabolic body weight (BW0.75), resulting in supply from 17.58 to 35.17 MJ ME intake per day (n = 6). All calves had ad libitum access to a commercial calf starter and water. Analysis of the transcriptome profiles at 54 ± 2 days of age revealed that a total of 396 out of 19,968 genes were differentially expressed (DE) between groups (p < 0.001, FDR < 0.1). The directional expression of DE genes through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that an enhanced nutrient supply alters adipose tissue physiology of pre-weaned calves. Several biological functions were increased (Z-score > +2), including Lipid Metabolism (Fatty Acid Metabolism), Cell Cycle (Entry into Interphase, Interphase, Mitosis and Cell Cycle Progression), Cellular Assembly and Organization (Cytoskeleton Formation and Cytoplasm Development) and Molecular Transport (Transport of Carboxylic Acid). These changes were potentially orchestrated by the activation/inhibition of 17 upstream regulators genes. Our findings indicate that adipose tissue of calves under an enhanced nutrient supply is physiologically distinct from restricted calves due to an increased development/expansion rate and also a higher metabolic activity through increased fatty acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2885700123,"In developing countries lacking functional vital registration system, statistical models are being increasingly used for estimating maternal mortality ratio (MMR). Yet, most of the models have limited applicability at sub-country level. This paper introduces a new model for estimating MMR at national and sub-national levels based on maternal health-related indicators. Further, it applies the model for explaining sub-national variations of MMR in Ethiopia.Country level data on MMR and other nine potential predictors of maternal death were extracted from 248 national Demographic and Health Surveys and other related surveys conducted in 80 low- and middle-income countries since 1990. Additional data were obtained from the World Bank and the World Health Organization databases. The potential model predictors were: contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR); utilizations of antenatal care (ANC), health institution delivery (HID), Caesarian section (CS) and postnatal care (PNC); and prevalence of maternal anemia, thinness (Body Mass Index (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), short stature (height less than 145 cms) and HIV. Stepwise Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) with Negative Log-binomial link was employed to model MMR as a function of the covariates.The ultimate model comprised six significant predictors and the equation is provided as: Ln (MMR) = 6.464-0.013(CPR)- 0.006(HID)- 0.003(PNC)- 0.027(CS rate) + 0.060(HIV prevalence) + 0.011 (thinness prevalence). The variation explained by the model was 54.3%) and the mean (±SD) relative standard error (8.6±2.6%) suggested the model has a reasonable precision. Application of the model to describe sub-national variation of maternal mortality in Ethiopia indicated, in 2016 the highest MMRs per 100,000 live births were in Somali (805) and Afar (795) regions. Between 2000 and 2016, all the regions of Ethiopia have significantly reduced MMRs; yet the rate of decline was lower in the aforementioned two regions. Oromiya region contributed for 46% of all maternal deaths in Ethiopia.In developing countries lacking dependable maternal mortality data; the model can be used to estimate national and sub-national MMR with reasonable accuracy and precision."
https://openalex.org/W2887370614,"There are two contrasting explanations of sleep: as a proximate, essential physiological function or as a behavioral, adaptive state of inactivity and these hypotheses remain widely debated. To investigate the adaptive significance of sleep, we develop an evolutionary argument formulated as a tractable partial differential equation model. We allow demographic parameters such as birth and mortality rates to vary through time in both safe and vulnerable sleeping environments. From this model we analytically calculate population growth rate (fitness) for sleeping and non-sleeping strategies. We find that, in a temporally heterogeneous environment, sleep behavior always achieves a higher fitness than non-sleeping behavior. As organisms do not exist in constant environments, we conclude that the evolution of sleep is inevitable. Further, we suggest that the two contrasting theories need not be mutually exclusive."

The secondary endpoints were the separate primary endpoint events at pre-defined time-points (in-hospital, 6 months, and yearly) and stent thrombosis. Time-dependent 9-year composite MACCE, all-cause death, and TVR were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression models.Propensity score analysis confirmed the comparability of the groups. Patients in the Genous and TAXUS groups had 7 and 1 acute definitive stent thrombosis events, respectively (p<0.001). There was a trend towards higher in-hospital MACCE in the Genous group (10.8%) versus the TAXUS group (4.0%). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 9-year MACCE was significantly worse in the Genous than in the TAXUS group. The in-hospital, 6-month, 1-year, and 9-year mortality rates were 7.8%, 8.8%, 9.8%, and 23.5% in the Genous group and 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, and 16.8% in the TAXUS group.Higher peri-procedural, in-hospital, and short-term mortality led to worse outcomes for first-generation Genous stents versus TAXUS Liberté stents for pPCI in STEMI. TAXUS Liberté stents had more favorable 9-year clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2885577212,"When the inside texture of a moving object moves, the perceived motion of the object is often distorted toward the direction of the texture's motion (motion-induced position shift), and such perceptual distortion accumulates while the object is watched, causing what is known as the curveball illusion. In a recent study, however, the accumulation of the position error was not observed in saccadic eye movements. Here, we examined whether the position of the illusory object is represented independently in the perceptual and saccadic systems. In the experiments, the stimulus of the curveball illusion was adopted to examine the temporal change in the position representation for saccadic eye movements and for perception by varying the elapsed time from the input of visual information to saccade onset and perceptual judgment, respectively. The results showed that the temporal accumulation of the motion-induced position shift is observed not only in perception but also in saccadic eye movements. In the saccade tasks, the landing positions of saccades gradually shifted to the illusory perceived position as the elapsed time from the target offset to the saccade ""go"" signal increased. Furthermore, in the perception task, shortening the time between the target offset and the perceptual judgment reduced the size of the illusion effect. Therefore, these results argue against the idea of dissociation between saccadic and perceptual localization of a moving object suggested in the previous study, in which saccades were measured in a rushed way while perceptual responses were measured without time constraint. Instead, the similar temporal trends of these effects imply a common or similar target representation for perception and eye movements which dynamically changes over the course of evidence accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2887903305,"Plants produce a wide range of secondary metabolites. Within a single species, chemotypes can be distinguished by the differences in the composition of the secondary metabolites. Herein, we evaluated Nectandra megapotamica (Spreng.) chemotypes and the balance of different classes of metabolites to verify how significant differences in plant metabolism are regarding chemotypes. We collected N. megapotamica leaves from eight adult plants in two Brazilian states. The essential oils and ethanol/water extracts were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-DAD-MS, respectively. Histochemical tests were performed, as well as chemical analyses of leaves from adaxial and abaxial foliar surfaces of N. megapotamica, and the stereochemistry of α-bisabolol was determined. Two different chemotypes, based on volatile compounds, were identified, distinguished by the presence of isospathulenol, α-bisabolol, β-bisabolene, and (E)-nerolidol for chemotype A, and bicyclogermacrene and elemicin for chemotype B. A stereochemical analysis of chemotype A extract revealed (+)-α-bisabolol enantiomer. Histochemical tests of chemotypes showed similar results and suggested the presence of essential oil in idioblasts stained with the dye NADI. The analyses of chemotype A leaves by GC-MS revealed similar compositions for abaxial and adaxial surfaces, such pattern was also observed for chemotype B. Medium and high polarity metabolites showed high chemical similarities between the chemotypes, highlighting the presence of proanthocyanidins and glycosylated flavonoids (O- and C-glycosides). Thus, N. megapotamica produced distinct volatile chemotypes with highly conserved medium to high polarity compounds. Such results suggest that phenolic derivatives have a basal physiological function, while genetic or environmental differences lead to differentiation in volatile profiles of N. megapotamica."
https://openalex.org/W2885061917,"Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a neurotropic human pathogen. Upon de novo infection, the viral infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) is immediately expressed and interacts with various cellular components during the viral replication cycle. ICP0 is a multifunctional regulatory protein that has been shown to be important for both efficient viral replication and virus reactivation from latency. In particular, as previously demonstrated in transfected tissue culture models, ICP0 interacts with the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH-1, which targets ICP0 for proteasomal degradation. However, the consequence of this virus-host interaction during the establishment of HSV-2 infection in vivo has not yet been elucidated. Here we confirmed that ICP0 of HSV-2 interacts with SIAH-1 via two conserved PxAxVxP amino acid binding motifs. We also demonstrate in vitro that a SIAH-1 binding-deficient HSV-2 strain, constructed by homologous recombination technology, exhibits an attenuated growth curve and impaired DNA and protein synthesis. This attenuated phenotype was also confirmed in an in vivo ocular infection mouse model. Specifically, viral load of the SIAH-1 binding-deficient HSV-2 mutant was significantly reduced in the trigeminal ganglia and brain stem at day 5 and 7 post infection. Our findings indicate that the interplay between ICP0 and SIAH-1 is important for efficient HSV-2 replication in vivo, thereby affecting viral dissemination kinetics in newly infected organisms, and possibly revealing novel targets for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2886375522,"Few studies of the health impact of the built environment have examined downstream outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. We analyzed the neighborhood-level proportional variance in the 10- and 30-year Framingham risk scores (FRS) in the Framingham Heart Study. Our analysis included 3,103 Offspring- and Generation 3 cohort participants 20–74 years old, inhabiting private residences in Massachusetts geocoded to neighborhoods (defined as 2000 US Census block groups) containing the residences of ≥5 participants. The outcome variables were log-transformed to mitigate the effects of the non-normal distributions. In order to remove the possible effects of neighborhood clustering by age and sex, we analyzed residuals of the transformed FRS regressed upon age and sex. Neighborhood-level intraclass correlations (ICCs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of age- and sex-independent, log-transformed FRS were estimated using multilevel linear regression. Individual- and neighborhood-level variables were then added to models to evaluate their influence on ICCs. Analyses were repeated stratified by sex. Among 2,888 participants living in 187 neighborhoods, 1.73% (95% CI: 0.62, 4.72%) of the variance in 10-year FRS was explained at the neighborhood level. The neighborhood ICC was 2.70% (95% CI: 0.93, 7.56) among women but 0.23% (95% CI: 0.00, 99.47%) among men. In the analysis of the neighborhood-level variances in 30-year FRS among 2,317 participants residing in 164 neighborhoods, the ICCs were 3.31% (95% CI: 1.66, 6.47%), 6.47% (95% CI: 3.22, 12.58), and 0.74% (95% CI: 0.01, 33.31), among all participants, women, and men, respectively. In our homogenous middle-class white population in Massachusetts, residential neighborhoods explained a small proportion of the variance in CVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W2886777840,"Background At times, ultrasound is not readily available in low resource countries in Africa for accurate determination of gestational age, so using alternative methods is pivotal during pregnancy. These assessments are used to aid the risk analysis for an infant and management strategies for premature delivery, if necessary. Currently, date of last menstrual period, fundal height measurements, and the New Ballard Score are commonly used in resource-limited settings. However, concordance of these measures is unknown for sub-Saharan Africa. We obtained data from an open-label randomized controlled trial, to assess the concordance of these alternative assessment methods. The purpose of our study was to determine the agreement between these alternative methods when used in sub-Saharan African populations. Methods A total of 4,390 pregnant women from Benin, Gabon, Mozambique and Tanzania were included in our analysis. The assessment methods compared were: 1) reported last menstrual period, 2) symphysis-fundal height measurement, and 3) the New Ballard Score. The Bland-Altman method and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to test the degree of agreement. Survival range gestational age, used as an inclusion criterion for further analysis, was from 22 to 44 weeks. Findings Plots showed a lack of agreement between methods and the 95% limits of agreement too wide to be clinically useful. ICC = 0.25 indicated poor agreement. A post-hoc analysis, restricted from 32 to 42 weeks, was done to check for better agreement in this near-term population. The plots and ICC = 0.16 still confirmed poor agreement. Conclusion The alternative assessments do not result in comparable outcomes and discrepancies are far beyond the clinically acceptable range. Last menstrual period should not be used as the only estimator of gestational age. In the absence of reliable early ultrasound, symphysis-fundal height measurements may be most useful during pregnancy for fetal risk assessment and the New Ballard Score after delivery as a confirmation of these estimations and for further neonatal management. However, promotion of portable ultrasound devices is required for accurate assessment of gestational age in sub-Sahara Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2887896130,"Gene regulatory networks (GRN) can be determined via various experimental techniques, and also by computational methods, which infer networks from gene expression data. However, these techniques treat interactions separately such that interdependencies of interactions forming meaningful subnetworks are typically not considered.For the investigation of network properties and for the classification of different (sub-)networks based on gene expression data, we consider biological network motifs consisting of three genes and up to three interactions, e.g. the cascade chain (CSC), feed-forward loop (FFL), and dense-overlapping regulon (DOR). We examine several conventional methods for the inference of network motifs, which typically consider each interaction individually. In addition, we propose a new method based on three-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) (3WA) that analyzes entire subnetworks at once. To demonstrate the advantages of such a more holistic perspective, we compare the ability of 3WA and other methods to detect and categorize network motifs on large real and artificial datasets.We find that conventional methods perform much better on artificial data (AUC up to 80%), than on real E. coli expression datasets (AUC 50% corresponding to random guessing). To explain this observation, we examine several important properties that differ between datasets and analyze predicted motifs in detail. We find that in case of real networks our new 3WA method outperforms (AUC 70% in E. coli) previous methods by exploiting the interdependencies in the full motif structure. Because of important differences between current artificial datasets and real measurements, the construction and testing of motif detection methods should focus on real data."
https://openalex.org/W2887091759,"Members of the Cysteine-rich secretory protein, Antigen 5 and Pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) protein superfamily are important virulence factors in fungi but remain poorly characterized on molecular level. Here, we investigate the cellular localization and molecular function of Rbe1p and Rbt4p, two CAP family members from the human pathogen Candida albicans. We unexpectedly found that Rbe1p localizes to budding sites of yeast cells in a disulfide bond-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that Rbe1p and Rbt4p bind free cholesterol in vitro and export cholesteryl acetate in vivo. These findings suggest a previously undescribed role for Rbe1p in cell wall-associated processes and a possible connection between the virulence attributes of fungal CAP proteins and sterol binding."
