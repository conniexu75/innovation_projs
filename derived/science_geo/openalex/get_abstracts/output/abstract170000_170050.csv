https://openalex.org/W2133157165,"Quantum communication holds a promise for absolutely secure transmission of secret messages and faithful transfer of unknown quantum states. Photonic channels appear to be very attractive for physical implementation of quantum communication. However, due to losses and decoherence in the channel, the communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. We describe a scheme that allows to implement robust quantum communication over long lossy channels. The scheme involves laser manipulation of atomic ensembles, beam splitters, and single-photon detectors with moderate efficiencies, and therefore well fits the status of the current experimental technology. We show that the communication efficiency scale polynomially with the channel length thereby facilitating scalability to very long distances."
https://openalex.org/W2041774199,"Two end member models of how the high elevations in Tibet formed are (i) continuous thickening and widespread viscous flow of the crust and mantle of the entire plateau and (ii) time-dependent, localized shear between coherent lithospheric blocks. Recent studies of Cenozoic deformation, magmatism, and seismic structure lend support to the latter. Since India collided with Asia approximately 55 million years ago, the rise of the high Tibetan plateau likely occurred in three main steps, by successive growth and uplift of 300- to 500-kilometer-wide crustal thrust-wedges. The crust thickened, while the mantle, decoupled beneath gently dipping shear zones, did not. Sediment infilling, bathtub-like, of dammed intermontane basins formed flat high plains at each step. The existence of magmatic belts younging northward implies that slabs of Asian mantle subducted one after another under ranges north of the Himalayas. Subduction was oblique and accompanied by extrusion along the left lateral strike-slip faults that slice Tibet's east side. These mechanisms, akin to plate tectonics hidden by thickening crust, with slip-partitioning, account for the dominant growth of the Tibet Plateau toward the east and northeast."
https://openalex.org/W1673514954,"Complementary sets of genes are epigenetically silenced in male and female gametes in a process termed genomic imprinting. The Dnmt3L gene is expressed during gametogenesis at stages where genomic imprints are established. Targeted disruption of Dnmt3L caused azoospermia in homozygous males, and heterozygous progeny of homozygous females died before midgestation. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of DNA from oocytes and embryos showed that removal of Dnmt3L prevented methylation of sequences that are normally maternally methylated. The defect was specific to imprinted regions, and global genome methylation levels were not affected. Lack of maternal methylation imprints in heterozygous embryos derived from homozygous mutant oocytes caused biallelic expression of genes that are normally expressed only from the allele of paternal origin. The key catalytic motifs characteristic of DNA cytosine methyltransferases have been lost from Dnmt3L, and the protein is more likely to act as a regulator of imprint establishment than as a DNA methyltransferase."

A family of Ir catalysts now enables the direct synthesis of arylboron compounds from aromatic hydrocarbons and boranes under “solventless” conditions. The Ir catalysts are highly selective for C–H activation and do not interfere with subsequent in situ transformations, including Pd-mediated cross-couplings with aryl halides. By virtue of their favorable activities and exceptional selectivities, these Ir catalysts impart the synthetic versatility of arylboron reagents to C–H bonds in aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W2126763121,"Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites infesting many animal groups. Lacking mitochondria and peroxysomes, these unicellular eukaryotes were first considered a deeply branching protist lineage that diverged before the endosymbiotic event that led to mitochondria. The discovery of a gene for a mitochondrial-type chaperone combined with molecular phylogenetic data later implied that microsporidia are atypical fungi that lost mitochondria during evolution. Here we report the DNA sequences of the 11 chromosomes of the approximately 2.9-megabase (Mb) genome of Encephalitozoon cuniculi (1,997 potential protein-coding genes). Genome compaction is reflected by reduced intergenic spacers and by the shortness of most putative proteins relative to their eukaryote orthologues. The strong host dependence is illustrated by the lack of genes for some biosynthetic pathways and for the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Phylogenetic analysis lends substantial credit to the fungal affiliation of microsporidia. Because the E. cuniculi genome contains genes related to some mitochondrial functions (for example, Fe-S cluster assembly), we hypothesize that microsporidia have retained a mitochondrion-derived organelle."

https://openalex.org/W2031616997,"A long-standing problem in biological and social sciences is to understand the conditions required for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in evolving populations. For many situations, kin selection is an adequate explanation, although kin-recognition may still be a problem. Explanations of cooperation between non-kin include continuing interactions that provide a shadow of the future (that is, the expectation of an ongoing relationship) that can sustain reciprocity, possibly supported by mechanisms to bias interactions such as embedding the agents in a two-dimensional space or other context-preserving networks. Another explanation, indirect reciprocity, applies when benevolence to one agent increases the chance of receiving help from others. Here we use computer simulations to show that cooperation can arise when agents donate to others who are sufficiently similar to themselves in some arbitrary characteristic. Such a characteristic, or 'tag', can be a marking, display, or other observable trait. Tag-based donation can lead to the emergence of cooperation among agents who have only rudimentary ability to detect environmental signals and, unlike models of direct or indirect reciprocity, no memory of past encounters is required."

https://openalex.org/W4210493499,"Devices that convert information from one form into another according to a definite procedure are known as automata. One such hypothetical device is the universal Turing machine, which stimulated work leading to the development of modern computers. The Turing machine and its special cases, including finite automata, operate by scanning a data tape, whose striking analogy to information-encoding biopolymers inspired several designs for molecular DNA computers. Laboratory-scale computing using DNA and human-assisted protocols has been demonstrated, but the realization of computing devices operating autonomously on the molecular scale remains rare. Here we describe a programmable finite automaton comprising DNA and DNA-manipulating enzymes that solves computational problems autonomously. The automaton's hardware consists of a restriction nuclease and ligase, the software and input are encoded by double-stranded DNA, and programming amounts to choosing appropriate software molecules. Upon mixing solutions containing these components, the automaton processes the input molecule via a cascade of restriction, hybridization and ligation cycles, producing a detectable output molecule that encodes the automaton's final state, and thus the computational result. In our implementation 1012 automata sharing the same software run independently and in parallel on inputs (which could, in principle, be distinct) in 120 microl solution at room temperature at a combined rate of 109 transitions per second with a transition fidelity greater than 99.8%, consuming less than 10-10 W."

https://openalex.org/W2075433744,"In Drosophila and mice, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the same receptors have convergent axonal projections to specific glomerular targets in the antennal lobe/olfactory bulb, creating an odour map in this first olfactory structure of the central nervous system1,2,3. Projection neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe send dendrites into glomeruli and axons to higher brain centres4, thereby transferring this odour map further into the brain. Here we use the MARCM method5 to perform a systematic clonal analysis of projection neurons, allowing us to correlate lineage and birth time of projection neurons with their glomerular choice. We demonstrate that projection neurons are prespecified by lineage and birth order to form synapses with specific incoming ORN axons, and therefore to carry specific olfactory information. This prespecification could be used to hardwire the fly's olfactory system, enabling stereotyped behavioural responses to odorants. Developmental studies lead us to hypothesize that recognition molecules ensure reciprocally specific connections of ORNs and projection neurons. These studies also imply a previously unanticipated role for precise dendritic targeting by postsynaptic neurons in determining connection specificity."

Here we investigate whether these factors influence lifespan by similar or independent mechanisms, by deliberately reducing the number of calories consumed by Ames dwarf mice. We show that calorie restriction confers a further lifespan increase in the dwarfs, indicating that the two factors may act through different pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2070513297,"Recent evidence shows the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitogenic cascade initiated by the tyrosine kinase receptors of several growth factor peptides. We have asked whether also the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) utilizes ROS as messenger intermediates downstream of the VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2)/KDR receptor given that the proliferation of endothelial cells during neoangiogenesis is physiologically regulated by oxygen and likely by its derivative species. In porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing human KDR, receptor activation by VEGF is followed by a rapid increase in the intracellular generation of hydrogen peroxide as revealed by the peroxide-sensitive probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that such oxidant burst requires as upstream events the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the small GTPase Rac-1 and is likely initiated by lipoxygenases. Interestingly, ROS generation in response to VEGF is not blocked but rather potentiated by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors diphenyleneiodonium and NGmethyl-l-arginine, ruling out the possibility of nitric oxide being the oxidant species here detected in VEGF-stimulated cells. Inhibition of KDR-dependent generation of ROS attenuates early signaling events including receptor autophosphorylation and binding to a phospholipase C-γ-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Moreover, catalase, the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid, the synthetic ROS scavenger EUK-134, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin all reduce ERK phosphorylation in response to VEGF, and antioxidants prevent VEGF-dependent mitogenesis. Finally, cell culture and stimulation in a nearly anoxic environment mimic the effect of ROS scavenger on receptor and ERK phosphorylation, reinforcing the idea that ROS are necessary components of the mitogenic signaling cascade initiated by KDR.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 2Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. Lee S.-R. Kwon J. Science's STKE.stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/53/pe1Date: 2000Google Scholar). While the modality of signal transduction by oxygen species is far from being completely elucidated, it has been clearly shown that these compounds, generated in a ligand-dependent fashion by nearly all the cell types, are necessary components in mitogenic and inflammatory signaling cascades and impinge mostly on key signaling events represented by protein tyrosine phosphorylation (3Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) (likely by inhibition of tyrosine phosphatase activities) and activation of a number of transcription factors (4Sun Y. Oberley W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Oxygen species generated upon receptor activation by either NADPH oxidase-like membrane complexes (5Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldsmith-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem.

Cellular receptors for epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin, and immunological stimuli are in fact all linked to ROS-generating systems, the block of which, as well as the removal of oxygen radicals by chemical or enzyme antioxidants, severely compromises cell response to mitogenic stimulation (7Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar, 8Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 347: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that signal transduction by oxygen species (“redox signaling”) represents a general and conserved component of the biochemical machinery triggered by tyrosine kinase receptors and leading, eventually, to cell proliferation. Among many known growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/permeability factor has in the last few years drawn significant attention as an endothelial cell-specific growth and survival factor and as a major inducer of vasculogenesis and neoangiogenesis in both physiological and pathological settings (11Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). In particular, for its capability to promote the formation of new blood vessels in the adult body, VEGF has gained central importance as a putative tool for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and, on the other side, as a potential target for tumor-suppressive therapies based on the inhibition of tumor vascularization (12Kerbel R.S. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). As for the latter point, it is relevant to note that VEGF is the major angiogenic factor produced by tumor cells and that experimental approaches aimed to interfere with VEGF signaling have proven successful in counteracting tumor growthin vivo (13Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Gillet N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar, 14Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). VEGF signals to endothelial cells mainly through two tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 or Flt-1 and VEGFR-2 or Flk-1/KDR (10Pani G. Colavitti R. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Both receptors are necessary for normal mouse development, but relevant differences have been identified in their signaling properties, the stimulation of Flt-1 being predominantly linked to cell migration, while Flk-1/KDR receptor activation is associated to both endothelial cell migration and proliferation and is followed, unlike for Flt-1, by the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (15Kroll J. Waltenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32521-32527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Much evidence suggests that ROS may play a role in angiogenesis. The up-regulation of both VEGF production and KDR expression are part of cell hypoxic response, which may involve as trigger the generation of hydrogen peroxide by mitochondria in low (1.5–2%) oxygen (16Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar); moreover, ROS increase the DNA binding activity of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, a transcription factor responsible for cell adaptation to hypoxia and in charge of the oxygen-dependent expression of the VEGF gene (16Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Finally, generation of ROS follows cell exposure to alternate hypoxia-reoxygenation, a condition representing per se a powerful proangiogenic stimulus (17Ray P.S. Sasaki H. Estrada-Hernandez T. Zu L. Maulik N. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite this evidence, however, the possibility that oxygen species may also contribute, as for other growth factors, to intracellular signaling by VEGF has not been investigated so far. It is known, however, that nitric oxide, a nitrogen-derived reactive species closely related to ROS, is produced by endothelial cells in response to VEGF and is part of the signaling cascade triggered by this factor (18Parenti A. Morbidelli L. Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Hood J.D. Granger H.J. Ledda F. Ziche M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4220-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Moreover another angiogenic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, has been shown to promote the generation of ROS in nonendothelial cells (19Lo Y.Y.C. Cruz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11727-11730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). On the basis of the above considerations, we evaluated whether ROS are generated in response to VEGF in endothelial cells expressing human KDR and whether a physiological role could be identified for these reactive species in VEGF-mediated angiogenic signaling. The generation of porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells stably expressing human KDR has been described elsewhere (13Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Gillet N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar). Cell were routinely maintained in Ham's medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 400 μg/ml neomycin (G418; Invitrogen). The construct encoding the Myc-tagged N17Rac-1 cDNA and the relative empty vector were kindly provided by Dr. A. Hall (Medical Research Council, London, United Kingdom). The Escherichia coli strains expressing the two SH2 domains of human PLC-γ fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST-PLC(2SH2)) and the GST-human SHP-1 fusion protein (GST-SHP1) were kind gifts of Dr. A. Pawson and Dr. K. A. Siminovitch (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada), respectively. The fusion proteins were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Advanced Biotechnology) for 3 h and purified from bacterial lysate with Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer. Antibodies used in the present study were anti-KDR (Sc-504; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-actin (Sc-1615; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10, Sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473 and Thr-308) (New England Biolabs), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents (anti-mouse IgG from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. and anti-rabbit IgG from Bio-Rad). Human recombinant VEGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Bovine liver catalase was purchased from Sigma. Chemicals and enzyme inhibitors were all from Sigma unless stated differently. The peroxide-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The synthetic superoxide/peroxide scavenger EUK-134 was generously provided by Eukarion Inc. (Bedford, MA). Autoradiography films were from Eastman Kodak Co. 2 × 105 PAE-KDR cells/well (six-well plate) were seeded in complete medium 16 h before transfection. Transfection was performed using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer with 1 μg of total DNA (RacN17 or vector) per sample. 24 h after transfection cells were trypsinized and replated in Ham's medium containing 1% FCS for further processing. The efficiency of transfection (about 40%) was determined using an equal amount of a plasmid encoding the green fluorescent protein under the cytomegalovirus promoter. The percentage of fluorescent cells was determined 48 h after transfection by flow cytometry. Protein expression in RacN17-transfected cells was assessed 48 h after transfection by anti-Myc tag immunoblotting. Bovine liver catalase (2500 units/mg of solid; Sigma) was dissolved in water at 10 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C. Some aliquots of the enzyme were inactivated at 100 °C for 20 min (heat-inactivated catalase). Frozen stocks were thawed and added to cells at the final concentration of 1 mg/ml in Ham's medium containing 1% FCS. After a 16-h incubation, catalase was removed by two to three washes with PBS, and cells were stimulated with VEGF and further processed for determination of intracellular ROS or protein phosphorylation. Bovine erythrocyte CuZn-superoxide dismutase (3100 units/mg of solid; Sigma) was dissolved in water at 1 mg/ml and added to cells in a 1:10 (v/v) ratio as described for catalase. PAE-neo and PAE-KDR cells were plated at the density of 105/well in a 24-well plate in Ham's medium containing 1% FCS and no G418. 16 h later adherent cells were washed with warm HBSS and stimulated with 50 ng/ml human VEGF or its vehicle alone (Sham) in 250 μl of HBSS. After the indicated times DCF-DA (20 μg/ml) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 5 min. Following removal of the supernatant cells were trypsinized and quickly analyzed for green fluorescence by flow cytometry (Coulter EPICS equipped with an argon laser lamp; emission, 480 nm; band pass filter, 530 nm). Mean fluorescence data were expressed as percent increase over unstimulated samples (Stimulated/Unstimulated × 100) or as net fluorescence increase (Stimulated − Unstimulated). In some experiments cells were pretreated with specific enzyme inhibitors (catalase, heat-inactivated catalase, CuZn-superoxide dismutase, rotenone, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), andNG-methyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA)) or relative vehicles in Ham's medium containing 1% FCS for 1 h before the wash and stimulation in HBSS. Wortmannin (1 μm) was added to cells 10 min before VEGF directly in the stimulation buffer (serum-free HBSS). In transfection experiments, changes in mean cell fluorescence were normalized for the percentage of transfected cells (determined as described above), according to the following formula: % fluorescence decrease (normalized) = % fluorescence decrease (raw)/% of transfected cells. For biochemical studies, PAE-KDR cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate and incubated for 16 h in Ham's medium containing 1% FCS. Stimulation with VEGF (50 ng/ml) or vehicle (4 mm HCl, 125 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; Sham) was performed in HBSS for 10–15 min. Stimulation with pervanadate (1 mm vanadate + 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 5 min on ice) was for 5 min. Pretreatment with catalase and enzyme inhibitors was performed as described in the previous section. After stimulation cells were lysed in 500 μl of 1% Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with the help of a rubber scraper. After 30 min on ice, cell debris was centrifuged (14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min), and the supernatant was immediately used for SDS-PAGE and immunoprecipitation studies or was stored at −80 °C. For determination of total protein tyrosine phosphorylation and of VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, equal amounts of protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Sartorius), and immunoblotted with specific antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10; 1:5000), phosphoserine Akt + phosphothreonine Akt (1:2000 + 1:2000) or phospho-ERK (1:1000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary reagents. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and autoradiography. Equal protein loading in all lanes was confirmed by reversible Ponceau S staining of nitrocellulose filters or, occasionally, by immunoblotting with an anti-actin antiserum. For immunoprecipitation and GST-PLC(2SH2) binding studies, 1 mg of total protein lysate was precleared with empty Sepharose beads and incubated with either 1 μg of anti-KDR antiserum and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads or 5 μg of Sepharose-bound fusion protein for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and further processed for analysis of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. For proliferation studies, 24-well plates were precoated with FCS for 2 h at 37 °C to ensure cell adhesion in serum-free medium; after careful removal of residual FCS, cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in serum-free Ham's medium containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin in the presence of Me2SO, 5 μg/ml NDGA, or 100 μmEUK-134. VEGF (50 ng/ml) or empty vehicle was added immediately after cell plating. After 4 days in culture adherent cells were trypsinized, mixed with the supernatant cells, quickly stained with propidium iodide, and subjected to flow cytometry. The live cell population was gated on the forward scatter plot, and the absolute number of cells was determined by using an internal fluorescent standard (Flow-count fluorospheres; Coulter). The percentage of dead (propidium iodide-positive) cells was determined on the number of total events (live cells + dead cells) after gating out cell debris. For experiments in an anoxic environment, a controlled atmosphere incubator (Forma Scientific model 1025) was supplied with a blend of 85% N2, 10% H2, and 5% CO2. Such equipment allows cell manipulation from outside the anoxic chamber. Cells were incubated in anoxia for 16 h in the normal incubator (Normoxia) or in very low oxygen (Anoxia) and stimulated with VEGF (50 ng/ml, 10 min) or pervanadate (1 mm, 5 min) or were left untreated. After lysis (anoxic cells were exposed to oxygen only after addition of cold lysis buffer) samples were processed as described above. Cell viability was higher than 90% after overnight incubation in very low oxygen. Equal amounts (1 μg) of GST-SHP-1 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were suspended in 200 μl of standard or nitrogen-purged (anoxic) phosphatase buffer (62 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 6.25 mm EDTA) in the absence of substrate. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °Cp-nitrophenyl phosphate was added at the concentration of 10 mm. In some samples 10 mm dithiothreitol was added 30 min before p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Color development was stopped after 5 min of incubation with 4 volumes (800 μl) of 200 mm NaOH, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate dephosphorylation was quantified spectrophotometrically at 410 nm. Immortalized PAE cells, despite their endothelial origin, express negligible amounts of endogenous VEGF receptors. Stable expression of either human VEGFR-1/Flt-1 or VEGFR-2/KDR in this cell line has therefore made it possible to dissect individually the signaling pathways initiated by the two VEGF receptors (13Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Gillet N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar). PAE-KDR cells in particular, like human primary endothelial cells, proliferate in response to VEGF in a fashion that correlates with an increase in the activity of the kinases ERK 1 and 2. Moreover, PAE-KDR cells, like their normal human counterparts, increase their proliferative response to VEGF in hypoxia and up-regulate, at a post-transcriptional level, the expression of KDR in low oxygen (20Waltenberger J. Mayr U. Pentz S. Hombach V. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This transfectant cell line retains therefore the features of human endothelial cells with respect to physiological modulation of KDR signaling and represents a suitable model for signal transduction studies on this receptor. Unlike parental PAE cells, KDR transfectants respond to VEGF with an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation involving mainly two protein species at 150 and 200 kDa, the latter likely representing the phosphorylated form of the KDR receptor (Fig.1A). Exposure of PAE-KDR cells to VEGF is also accompanied, within minutes, by a significant rise in intracellular ROS as revealed by a net increase in cell fluorescence after cell loading with the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent dye DCF-DA (Fig. 1B). Oxidative response clearly occurs via KDR stimulation since it is completely absent in PAE parental cells (Fig.1B); a time course analysis of ROS generation following addition of VEGF revealed that the generation of intracellular peroxide is very rapid and sustained over 30 min of observation (Fig.1C), a kinetic that parallels that of receptor autophosphorylation (not shown and Fig. 4B). The oxygen species responsible for DCF-DA oxidation is most likely hydrogen peroxide since ligand-induced oxidation is completely abolished in cells loaded with the specific scavenger enzyme catalase (Fig.1C) but not with heat-inactivated enzyme (Fig.1C) or with native superoxide dismutase (not shown). Note that DCF-DA detects mostly hydrogen peroxide or other organic peroxides and is relatively insensitive to superoxide or nitric oxide (21LeBel C.P. Ischiropoulos H. Bondy S.C. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar).Figure 4Effect of catalase and NDGA on KDR phosphorylation and signaling. Cells pretreated with catalase, heat-inactivated catalase, NDGA (5 μg/ml), Me2SO, or PBS were stimulated and lysed as described in the appropriate section.A and B, tyrosine phosphorylation of total protein lysates. Some phosphoproteins predominant in the high molecular weight range and induced by VEGF are indicated by arrows. The band around 200 kDa most likely represents the phosphorylated form of KDR. Protein phosphorylation is abolished or significantly attenuated by both catalase and NDGA. C, tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR receptor in NDGA-treated cells. KDR was immunoprecipitated from stimulated and unstimulated cells, and immunocomplexes were subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The phosphoprotein around 200 kDa represents the phosphorylated form of the receptor. D, NDGA prevents KDR binding to PLC-γ. Protein lysates were challenged with a GST fusion protein containing the two SH2 domains of human PLC-γ or with GST alone as negative control. SH2-bound phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. VEGF induces association of PLC-γ with a 200-kDa phosphoprotein likely representing the phosphorylated KDR. Such association is clearly inhibited by NDGA. Equal protein loading was verified in all the displayed experiments by reversible Ponceau S staining and/or anti-actin immunoblotting. H.I.

In PAE-KDR cells ROS production following stimulation by VEGF was resistant to inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig.2A, rotenone) but was significantly reduced by both the peroxide scavenger and lipoxygenase inhibitor NDGA and the highly specific lipoxygenase inhibitor 5,8,11-eicosatriynoic acid, suggesting that oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes may have a role in the observed oxidative phenomena (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, both the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI and the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitorl-NMMA were consistently found to potentiate the basal (not shown) and VEGF-induced generation of peroxides in KDR cells (Fig.2B). While this finding argues against a NADPH oxidase-like complex playing a major role in peroxide generation by VEGF, the possibility that oxidations detected by DCF-DA in response to VEGF are due to generation of nitric oxide (a phenomenon already reported in this cell line (22Kroll J. Waltenberger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) is also ruled out in view of the paradoxical effect of l-NMMA. It should be noted that DPI, which blocks flavin-containing enzymes, is also a potent inhibitor of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (23Wang Y.X. Poon C.I. Poon K.S. Pang C.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1232-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). PI 3-kinase associates with KDR in endothelial cells and is necessary for VEGF-mediated cell cycle progression (24Thakker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Since PI 3-kinase is necessary for ROS production in fibroblasts stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (25Bae Y.S. Sung J.Y. Kim O.S. Kim Y.J. Hur K.C. Kazlauskas A. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10527-10531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), likely through the activation of the small GTPase Rac-1, we thought to evaluate whether this enzyme is also involved in redox events elicited by VEGF in endothelial cells. A brief (15-min) exposure to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmanninn (1 μm) nearly completely abolished the generation of peroxide in stimulated PAE-KDR cells, confirming that, as for platelet-derived growth factor, PI 3-kinase is located upstream of a ROS source activated by VEGF (Fig.3A, a). Note that 1 μm wortmannin was not toxic for PAE-KDR cells in the indicated time frame. Another unrelated PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, had an effect similar to that of wortmannin (not shown). As a positive control for the effective inhibition of PI 3-kinase, the VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, was also abolished by wortmannin in the same experimental conditions in which the elevation of intracellular ROS was inhibited (Fig. 3A, b). A dominant-negative mutant of the small GTPase Rac-1, a molecule crucial for both ligand-induced generation of ROS and lipoxygenase activation in several cellular models, also inhibits significantly VEGF-induced oxidative burst when overexpressed by transient transfection in PAE cells (Fig. 3B, a andb), suggesting a role for Rac-1 in transducing redox signals by KDR.

We identified 147 genes whose levels of expression were significantly altered in RNA obtained from cells demonstrating a transformed phenotype with stable GLI1 expression or stableHa-ras expression. Comparison of expression profiles fromGLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells established a set of genes unique to GLI1-induced cell transformation. Thirty genes were altered by stable GLI1 expression, and 124 genes were changed by stable Ha-ras expression. Seven genes had altered expression levels in both GLI1- andHa-ras-expressing cells. Genes whose expression was altered by GLI1 included cell cycle genes, cell adhesion genes, signal transduction genes, and genes regulating apoptosis. GLI1 consensus DNA-binding sequences were identified in the 5′ regions of cyclin D2, IGFBP-6, osteopontin, and plakoglobin, suggesting that these genes represent immediate downstream targets. Gel shift analysis confirmed the ability of the GLI1 protein to bind these sequences. Up-regulation of cyclin D2 and down-regulation of plakoglobin were demonstrated in GLI1-amplified compared with non-amplified human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Many of theGLI1 targets with known function identified in this study increase cell proliferation, indicating that GLI1-induced cell transformation occurs through multiple downstream pathways.

Important gene hierarchies, in part coding for components of signal transduction pathways, regulate growth and differentiation during development. One such pathway is the Sonic hedgehog-Patched-Gli pathway (1Villavicencio E.H. Walterhouse D.O. Iannaccone P.M. Am. J. Hum.

Dev. 1997; 62: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of these genes, GLI1, has been shown to be a transcriptional activator operating through a C-terminal VP-16-like acidic helical domain (11Yoon J.W. Liu C.Z. Yang J.T. Swart R. Iannaccone P. Walterhouse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3496-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GLI1 transforms cells in culture, and its expression is associated with significant human cancers including basal cell carcinoma (12Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Nature. 1997; 389: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), medulloblastoma (13Hahn H. Wojnowski L. Zimmer A.M. Hall J. Miller G. Zimmer A. Nat.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1065-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Few downstream targets of GLI1 are known, which precludes a clear understanding of its action in carcinogenesis. Genetic evidence suggests that PTCH and Wnt genes are downstream targets of GLI1 (15Mullor J.L. Dahmane N. Sun T. Ruiz i Altaba A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 769-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence has established HNF-3β (HepatocyteNuclear Factor-3β) as a target ofGLI1 during development (16Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sonic hedgehog transforming growth factor-β amino acids glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase insulin-like growth factor Microarray technology has provided a methodology to study the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously and has been used in many important settings (17Afshari C.A. Nuwaysir E.F. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4759-4760PubMed Google Scholar). Among these is the dissection of signal transduction pathways. To identify unique downstream targets ofGLI1, we have utilized a cell transformation phenotype as a selection system for the stable integration and expression of eitherGLI1 or Ha-ras in RK3E cells. To identify genes specific to the GLI1 transformation process, the expression profiles of cells transformed with GLI1 were compared with those from cells transformed with Ha-ras. Untransformed and transformed cells following transfection without drug selection were cloned, and gene expression profiles were established. We found 147 genes with altered expression levels from 4,608 UniGene clones, 30 as a result of stable GLI1 expression and 124 as a result of stable Ha-ras expression. Six genes were down-regulated by both GLI1 and Ha-ras expression. One gene was up-regulated by GLI1 and down-regulated byHa-ras. Genes whose expression was altered by GLI1 included cell cycle genes, cell adhesion genes, signal transduction genes, and genes regulating apoptosis. GLI1 consensus DNA-binding sequences were identified in the 5′ regions of cyclin D2, IGFBP-6(IGF-binding protein 6), osteopontin, and plakoglobin. Gel shift analysis confirmed the ability of GLI1 protein to bind these sequences. Up-regulation of cyclin D2 and down-regulation of plakoglobin were also demonstrated in GLI1-amplified human tumor cells. Thus, cellular transformation by the human oncogene GLI1 proceeds via multiple downstream pathways. Rat kidney epithelial cells stably transfected with E1A (RK3E cells, American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1895) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Both theGLI1 and Ha-ras genes have been shown to transform RK3E cells (18Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The human GLI1 (pLTR-GLI) orHa-ras (pOH6T1) (19Spandidos D.A. Wilkie N.M. Nature. 1984; 310: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) expression constructs were introduced into rat kidney cells (RK3E) by liposome-mediated transfection and transformed foci formed in 1–2 weeks. Cell lines were established by trypsinization of foci. GLI1-transformed RK3E cells did not show significant morphological differences compared with the parental RK3E cells at low density, however, and formed foci when grown to confluence. Ha-ras-transformed cells showed greater morphological changes and grew in a more anchorage-independent manner (data not shown) compared with the parental RK3E cells and even at low density formed foci. Both GLI1- andHa-ras-transformed RK3E cells showed increased growth rates compared with RK3E cells. Western blot analysis using RK3E cells transformed with GLI1 revealed a 150-kDa GLI1 protein band. GLI1 protein was not detected in RK3E cells orHa-ras-transformed RK3E cells establishing the presence of stable protein product from the integrated GLI1 gene (data not shown). Rat UniGene clones (4,608) supplied by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) were PCR-amplified with a primer set including T7/T3 promoters as follows: 5′-TTACGAATTTAATACGACTCACTATA-3′; 5′-AAGCTAAAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′. GAPDH and β-actin served as control genes and were amplified with a primer set including M13/T7 promoters as follows: 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′; 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′. PCRs were carried out in 384-well plates with a reaction volume of 10 μl using a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-225 (MJ Research, Watertown, MA) including 1 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase purified using a Centri-Sep Column (Princeton Separation, Adelphia, NJ), 250 nm each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, and 0.4 μl of each cDNA clone. The first cycle was 95 °C for 11 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The 2nd to 36th cycles were 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final extension was 72 °C for 7 min. After the reactions, 7 μl of water and 17 μl of Me2SO were added to the reaction mixtures. All PCRs were analyzed with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis using EAGLE EYE II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The microarrays were produced on poly-l-lysine-coated slides with a spacing of 180 μm in the area of 18 × 36 mm using a 4-pin arrayer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Each cDNA was stamped from the 384-well plates directly without purification of PCR products. The printed arrays were incubated in a humid chamber (Sigma) to allow rehydration with 1× SSC for 2 h and heated on hot plates at 85 °C for 2 h. The arrays were UV cross-linked for 65 min with a Stratalinker (Stratagene), stabilized in 10% formalin for 1 min, and then rinsed with distilled water 2 times. They were immersed in succinic anhydride (5.5 g/325 ml of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone) and then in 25 ml of 1 m sodium borate, pH 8.0, for 20 min, submerged in distilled water for 2 min at 95 °C, quickly transferred into 95% EtOH, dried by centrifugation, and stored until used in the dark at room temperature. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using the Poly(A) Pure mRNA isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). For Northern blot analysis, 3 μg of poly(A)+RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and then transferred to nylon membranes (BrightStar Plus, Ambion). The membrane was baked at 80 °C for 2 h and then prehybridized at 42 °C for 30 min in a hybridization buffer (Ultrahyb, Ambion). The hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 4 h with appropriate 32P-labeled DNA probes prepared by random priming (Rediprime II, Amersham Biosciences). The RNA bands were detected by autoradiography. The probes were obtained from Research Genetics. Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences)-incorporated cDNA probes were prepared at 39 °C from 4 μg of mRNA in a reaction volume of 90 μl including 9 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 4 μg of (dT)12–18 primer, 1800 units of SuperScriptII, 500 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 40 μm dTTP, 40 μm Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP. After 120 min 8 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After preparation, Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were mixed and purified with a Centri-Sep Column and a PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The probes were concentrated with Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Ten μg of poly(dA) (Sigma) and 20 μg of yeast total RNA (Invitrogen) were added to the concentrated probe. The hybridization solution (11 μl; 3.5× SSC and 0.35% SDS) was applied to the microarray under a 22 × 22-mm coverslip for 17 h at 65 °C. The slide was rinsed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min, 0.2 × SSC for 2 min and then 0.05 × SSC for 2 min at room temperature. The slide was scanned with a ScanArray 5000 (General Scanning, Watertown, MA) to detect the two-color fluorescence hybridization signals. Because of potential bias produced by different incorporation rates between Cy3- and Cy5-dUTP, two slides were used for each of four independent RNA preparations. For one slide, fluorescent cDNA probes were prepared from mRNA from RK3E cells (Cy3-labeled) and GLI1- orHa-ras-transformed RK3E cells (Cy5-labeled); for the other slide fluorescent cDNA probes were prepared from mRNA ofGLI1- or Ha-ras-transfected RK3E cells (Cy3-labeled) and RK3E cells (Cy5-labeled). The procedure was performed using two independent clones obtained from two independent transfections for both GLI1 and Ha-rastransformed cells. Data reduction was done with the program Gleams 2.0 (NuTec Services, Stafford, TX). Each spot was defined by manual positioning of a grid of circles over the array image. Signal intensity was determined by subtraction of local background from the mean intensity. Normalization between the dyes was accomplished by normalizing each dye to mean intensities of all genes. The threshold was set at 50% of the mean (Cy3 intensity + Cy5 intensity) of all genes for each array. In the plot of log (Cy3 + Cy5) versuslog (Cy3/Cy5) (20Marton M.J. DeRisi J.L. Bennett H.A.

Science. 2000; 287: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), genes with a signal intensity below 50% of the mean of (Cy3 + Cy5) showed large variances of the Cy3/Cy5 ratio. By using this threshold, 1778 and 1823 genes were selected inGLI1-RK3E versus RK3E and Ha-ras-RK3Eversus RK3E microarrays, respectively. Following the intensity normalization, the log values of GLI1-RK3E orHa-ras-RK3E versus RK3E ratios were counted for each experiment, and the mean ratios of four slides in each group was calculated for each gene. The means (±S.D.) of the log of the ratios, calculated as described above, for all genes that met the 50% threshold were 0.003 (±0.133) for GLI1-RK3Eversus RK3E and −0.019 (±0.199) for Ha-ras-RK3Eversus RK3E cells. Genes were identified as having significantly different expression levels by comparison with the mean ± 2 S.D. of GLI1-RK3E versus RK3E (0.003 ± 0.266) to evaluate differential gene expression with a common criterion between GLI1-RK3E versus RK3E and Ha-ras-RK3E versus RK3E. The distribution of gene expression of Ha-ras-RK3E versus RK3E cells was wider than that of GLI1-RK3E versus RK3E cells indicating that Ha-ras induces expression changes in more genes than does GLI1. We evaluated the variation induced by differences in dye incorporation and variation by cell batch and slide. The log of ratios of all genes for each slide was compared with the above mean ± 2 S.D. (0.003 ± 0.266) and scored as follows. Ratios < mean −2 S.D. were scored −1; ratios > mean + 2 S.D. were scored +1, and others were scored 0. The score was summed for all slides, and genes with scores of 4, 3, −3, or −4 were selected. The ratio of mRNA level is expressed asGLI1-RK3E/RK3E or Ha-ras-RK3E/RK3E. Positive values mean that the mRNA level in GLI1- orHa-ras-transformed cells is larger than that in RK3E cells; negative values mean that the mRNA level in RK3E cells is larger than that in GLI1- or Ha-ras-transformed cells. Sequence homology searches of genes identified in this way were done using GenBankTM data bases and the BLAST search program (NCBI). The criterion of homology was 85% sequence match without gaps over 100 base pairs of sequence (22Makalowski W. Boguski M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9407-9412Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Biotinylated GLI1 fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli using the PinPointTM Xa system (Promega, Madison, WI). The pinpoint-GLI1 aa-211–1106 fusion construct was prepared by inserting the BamHI fragment of the human GLI1cDNA (pK12 GLI) into the BamHI site of the PinPoint Xa2 plasmid (Promega). For protein production, bacterial cultures were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for 3 h. Bacteria were then harvested, sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation. The GLI1 aa 211–1106 and control proteins (protein from Promega PinPoint plasmid or biotinylated GLI1 aa 879–1106, which lacks the zinc fingers) in the clear lysate were purified using SoftLinkTM Avidin resin (Promega). Approximately 160 ng of the purified GLI1 aa-211–1106 protein or control protein was mixed with 5 μl of 2× binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol (v/v), 50 μmpoly(dI-dC), and 10 μm ZnSO4), H2O, and 0 or 1 μl (2 pmol) of unlabeled competitor or mutant GLI1-binding site competitor oligonucleotide (16Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. 1 μl (40 fmol) of double-stranded 32P-labeled probes (human cyclin D2 sense strand 5′-GACTTCTGCTCGCCCACCACCCAATCCTCGCCT-3′ and human cyclin D2 antisense strand 5′-GACTAGGCGAGGATTGGGTGGTGGGCGAGCAGA-3′; humanIGFBP-6 sense strand 5′-GACTCCCTGACCATGACCCCCCACAGGCTGCTG-3′ and human IGFBP-6 antisense strand 5′-GACTCAGCAGCCTGTGGGGGGTCATGGTCAGGG-3′; rat osteopontin sense strand 5′-GACTTGGTGGCTCGGACCTCCCAGAATTTAAAC-3′ and rat osteopontin antisense strand 5′-GACTGTTTAAATTCTGGGAGGTCCGAG CCACCA-3′; human plakoglobin sense strand 5′-GACTTCTCATTTGAAGGACCACCAACCAG-3′ and human plakoglobin antisense strand 5′-GACTCTGGTTGGTGGTCCTTCAAATGAGA-3′; and mutant GLI-binding site sense strand 5′-GACTCTCCCGAAGAAGTGGGACAATGATGGTTC-3′ and mutant GLI-binding site antisense strand 5′-GACTGAACCATCATTGTCCCACTTCTTCGGGAG-3′) were added, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for an additional 20 min. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. We performed microarray assays using the RK3E cell line transformed independently with two oncogenes (Figs.1 and 2) and examined 4,608 rat UniGene sequences. Comparison of expression profiles from GLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells established a set of genes unique to GLI1-induced cell transformation. This method identified 147 genes whose levels of expression were significantly altered in the RNA obtained from RK3E cells with stable GLI1 expression or stableHa-ras expression. Thirty genes were altered by stableGLI1 expression as follows: 11 were highly up-regulated (>3 S.D.), 4 were up-regulated (>2 S.D.), 5 genes were highly down-regulated (>3 S.D.), and 10 genes were down-regulated (>2 S.D.). A total of 124 genes were changed by stable Ha-rasexpression as follows: 30 genes were highly up-regulated (>3 S.D.), 19 genes were up-regulated (>2 S.D.), 56 genes were highly down-regulated (>3 S.D.), and 19 genes were down-regulated (>2 S.D.). Only 7 genes had altered expression levels in both RK3E cells with stableGLI1 expression and RK3E cells with stable Ha-rasexpression. Six of these were down-regulated by both GLI1and Ha-ras expression, whereas one of these, serine dehydratase-2, was up-regulated by stable GLI1 expression and down-regulated by stable Ha-ras expression. This observation clearly suggests that the oncogenes GLI1 andHa-ras depend on distinct sets of gene activities to transform the same RK3E cells.Figure 2Identification of downstream targets of GLI1 by microarray and Northern blot analyses.

PTCH, a member of SHH-Patched signaling pathway, which is believed to be a downstream target of GLI1 based on genetic analysis (23Muller B. Basler K. Development. 2000; 127: 2999-3007PubMed Google Scholar), was induced by GLI1 as predicted. We also observed induction of cyclin D2, implicating GLI1 in the regulation of the cell cycle. RK3E+GLI1 cells also expressed a number of genes involved in cell structure, movement, and adhesion. Osteopontin and lysyl hydroxylase genes were up-regulated, whereas embigin and plakoglobin genes were down-regulated. A gene involved in IGF signaling (IGFBP-6) was up-regulated. A number of transcription factor genes showed altered expression in the GLI1-transformed cells. Npdc1 (neural proliferationdifferentiation and control gene 1) andTSC-22 (TGF-β-stimulatedclone 22) are in this category. Known genes down-regulated by both GLI1 and Ha-ras were TSC-22, which is a target of the tumor suppressor TGF-β, and Tom1(target of myb1). We performed Northern analysis to confirm the microarray data using probes to a number of the target genes identified by the microarray analysis (Fig. 2 B). By using cDNA probes to theGLI1-regulated genes, significant increases in signal were seen for osteopontin, cyclin D2, H19, IGFBP-6,and PTCH, whereas significant decreases in signal were seen for TSC-22 and Tom1 as predicted by the microarray analysis. We have identified 30 genes regulated by the GLI1 oncogene. To determine whether these were direct downstream targets, we exploited the fact that GLI1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that interacts with the motif GACCACCCA. Among the genes regulated byGLI1, we found five genes with 5′ sequences suitable for analysis. Of these, four genes contained putative GLI1-binding elements (Fig. 3). The putative GLI1-binding elements each show 1-base difference from the 9-bp consensus. It was shown previously that the HNF-3β enhancer, which contains 8 bp of matching sequence (GAACACCCA), is a functional GLI1-binding site (16Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A putative GLI1-binding motif (CACCACCCA) was found in the core promoter of human cyclin D2 (24Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Osteopontin promoters of rat and mouse have a putative GLI1-binding site (GACCTCCCA). The motifs GTCCACCCA and GACCCCCCA were found in rat and human IGFBP-65′ regions, respectively. Interestingly, although plakoglobin expression is reduced in cells transfected with GLI1, the human plakoglobin promoter also contains a putative GLI1-binding element (GACCACCAA). We performed gel mobility shift assays to determine whether the GLI1 protein physically binds to the putative GLI1-binding elements (Fig.4). The putative GLI1-binding element from the human cyclin D2 core promoter region shifted in the presence of GLI1 protein (Fig. 4 A). The same gel shift assay was performed with IGFBP-6 probe (Fig. 4 B), osteopontin probe, and plakoglobin probe (Fig. 4 C). All of the probes produced specific shifted bands. By using probes for human cyclin D2 and human plakoglobin, Northern blots were performed on cells derived from two different human rhabdomyosarcomas (Fig.5). The A673 rhabdomyosarcoma does not express GLI1, whereas RMS-13 is highly amplified forGLI1. The A673 cells do not express demonstrable levels of cyclin D2 by Northern blot but have abundant plakoglobin message. In the RMS-13 human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, there is abundant cyclin D2 and no plakoglobin RNA. Thus, cyclin D2 and plakoglobin Northern data from human tumor cells are consistent with the microarray results. The GLI family of proteins are key mediators of SHH signaling in mammalian development. GLI1 is an oncogene expressed at high levels in many human cancers. GLI1 is a transcriptional activator, but the downstream targets of this gene, other than HNF-3β in mouse (16Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and wg inDrosophila (25Von Ohlen T. Hooper J.E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), have not been identified at a biochemical level. There are no proven human targets. Without knowing the range of genes regulated by GLI1, it will be difficult to understand its role in development or in cancer. Here we show that the expression of 30 genes was altered byGLI1 expression in transformed RK3E cells. Among them, 15 genes were up-regulated and 15 genes were down-regulated. This represents 0.65% of the genes examined, whereas 2.7% of the genes examined were altered by Ha-ras expression. Importantly the gene expression profiles of GLI1 and Ha-ras did not overlap with the exception of seven genes regulated by both oncogenes. Furthermore, the genes activated by GLI1 were not those regulated by other oncogenes such as c-myc (26Guo Q.M. Malek R.L. Kim S. Chiao C., He, M. Ruffy M. Sanka K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Liu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zuber J. Tchernitsa O.I. Hinzmann B. Schmitz A.C. Grips M. Hellriegel M. Sers C. Rosenthal A. Schafer R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression profile for GLI1 transformation is specific and unique. GLI1 has been proven to be a transcriptional activator, although convincing evidence of repressor activity is lacking. Nevertheless, we observed that a number of genes were down-regulated, although this may be the result of indirect effects ofGLI1 expression. We examined the 5′ sequences for GLI1-binding sites in five genes for which appropriate sequence data were available that had altered expression levels in response toGLI1 expression. Functional GLI1 binding domains were found in four of them, one of which one is down-regulated in response toGLI1 expression. Recent evidence demonstrates that SHH opposes cell cycle arrest in epithelial cells (28Fan H. Khavari P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the GLI transcription factors mediate SHH signaling and GLI1is the demonstrated oncogene in the family, it is reasonable to suggest that down-regulating GLI1 is important in cell cycle arrest. Based on our microarray results, we postulate that GLI1regulates growth via several gene networks. GLI1 directly regulates cyclin D2 expression, and the human cyclin D2 promoter (24Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) contains a GLI1 binding consensus that we show interacts with human GLI1 protein. The human cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 promoters have similar elements that do not physically interact with GLI1 (data not shown). Cyclin D2 regulates the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle. The net result of this change in gene expression in response to GLI1 is to drive cells continuously through the cell cycle. GLI1 regulates genes important to cell adhesion, cell movement, and apoptosis. For example, we found up-regulation of the osteopontin gene a secreted glycoprotein expressed in bone but not detected in the normal matrix of most tissues. Osteopontin promotes cell attachment and migration through its recognition by integrins (29Liaw L. Linder V. Schwartz S.M. Chambers A.F. Giachelli C.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast (30Sharp J.A. Sung V. Slavin J. Thompson E.W. Henderson M.A. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 869-877PubMed Google Scholar) and malignant gliomas (31Gunnersen J.M. Spirkoska V. Smith P.E. Danks R.A. Tan S.S. Glia. 2000; 32: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Markert J.M. Fuller C.M. Gillespie G.Y. Bubien J.K. McLean L.A. Hong R.L. Lee K. Gullans S.R. Mapstone T.B. Benos D.J. Physiol.

Invest. 1995; 72: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar).GLI1 down-regulates the expression of plakoglobin (γ-catenin), a cytoplasmic protein associated with cadherins. Cadherins are transmembrane proteins that are linked to cytoplasmic actin bundles via catenins. Increased expression of plakoglobin is associated with stunted hair growth, reduced epidermal proliferation, and apoptosis (34Charpentier E. Lavker R.M. Acquista E. Cowin P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Another example of negative regulation byGLI1 is reduction of embigin expression. Embigin is a cell adhesion molecule that is known to promote integrin-mediated cell-substratum adhesion (35Tachikui H. Kurosawa N. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 240: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36Huang R.P. Ozawa M. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Dev. Biol. 1993; 155: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lysyl hydroxylase, which cross-links collagen through intermolecular hydroxylation and plays a role in bone matrix formation, is up-regulated (37Uzawa K. Grzesik W.J. Nishiura T. Kuznetsov S.A. Robey P.G. Brenner D.A. Yamauchi M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The gene expression profiles showed that GLI1 expression regulates the activity of genes in several signal transduction pathways. Patched (PTCH), the transmembrane receptor of SHH, is up-regulated. Because PTCH inhibits smoothened, another transmembrane receptor, which activates GLI1, this establishes a negative feedback loop in the presence of SHH signaling.GLI1 down-regulates TGF-β-stimulated cloneTSC-22 (a leucine zipper transcription factor). The pattern of expression during murine embryonic development of TSC-22(38Dohrmann C.E. Belaoussoff M. Raftery L.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 84: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) is similar to that of GLI1. TSC-22 mediates TGF-β tumor suppressor function by activating apoptosis and repressing growth (39Ohta S. Yanagihara K. Nagata K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 40Uchida D. Kawamata H. Omotehara F. Miwa Y. Hino S. Begum N.M. Yoshida H. Sato M. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because GLI1 repressesTSC-22, loss of its tumor suppressor function may be an important consequence of GLI1 expression in malignant transformation. Up-regulation of growth factor regulators was also discovered with this analysis. H19 and IGF2 genes are imprinted and closely linked on the chromosome (41Bartolomei M.S. Zemel S. Tilghman S.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 42Jouvenot Y. Poirier F. Jami J. Paldi A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1199-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They can be up-regulated together in a variety of tumors (43Sohda T. Iwata K. Soejima H. Kamimura S. Shijo H. Yun K. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We observed increasedH19 expression in GLI1-transformed RK3E cells. IGFBP-6 is an IGF2-binding protein whose function is not clearly understood. IGFBP-6 expression is stimulated by retinoic acid (44Gabbitas B. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by TGF-β1 (45Gabbitas B. Canalis E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Its overexpression is also associated with several tumors. The up-regulation of H19 andIGFBP-6 by GLI1 expression may be involved in maintaining the proliferative state of cells and preventing cellular differentiation. In aggregate these results show thatGLI1 provides strong cellular proliferation signals by transcriptional activation of cell cycle regulators, cell adhesion genes, growth factor regulators, and regulators of apoptosis (Fig.6). For example, activation of cyclin D2 forces cells through the cell cycle. Repression of embigin and plakoglobin with induction of osteopontin reduces cell adhesion. Signaling changes in the SHH pathway itself by induction ofPTCH, reduction of TSC-22, and changes in IGF signaling through increases in IGFBP-6 increase cellular proliferation and decrease apoptosis. In addition GLI1expression alters regulation of apoptosis because plakoglobin expression is associated with apoptosis and TSC-22 mediates the apoptotic function of TGF-β (40Uchida D. Kawamata H. Omotehara F. Miwa Y. Hino S. Begum N.M. Yoshida H. Sato M. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2041421563,"The neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor gene, NF2, is mutated in the germ line of NF2 patients and predisposes affected individuals to intracranial and spinal tumors. Moreover, somatic mutations of NF2 can occur in the sporadic counterparts of these neurological tumor types as well as in certain neoplasms of non-neuroectodermal origin, such as malignant mesothelioma and melanoma. NF2 encodes a 595-amino acid protein, merlin, which exhibits significant homology to the ezrin-radixin-moesin family of proteins. However, the mechanism by which merlin exerts its tumor suppressor activity is not well understood. In this investigation, we show that merlin is phosphorylated in response to expression of activated Rac and activated Cdc42 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that merlin phosphorylation is mediated by p21-activated kinase (Pak), a common downstream target of both Rac and Cdc42. Both in vivo and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that Pak can directly phosphorylate merlin at serine 518, a site that affects merlin activity and localization. These biochemical investigations provide insights into the regulation of merlin function and establish a framework for elucidating tumorigenic mechanisms involved in neoplasms associated with merlin inactivation.

However, the cellular function and regulation of merlin is not well understood. Because of the similarity between merlin and ERM proteins, and the fact that ERM proteins are phosphorylated by Rho GTPase-mediated signaling (4Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Google Scholar, 5Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Google Scholar), we tested whether merlin is also regulated by members of the Rho family of GTPases. Our investigations have determined that merlin is phosphorylated in response to constitutively active Rac1 and, to a lesser extent, Cdc42, and this phosphorylation is mediated by the Rac/Cdc42 effector, p21-activated kinase (Pak). A human NF2 expression plasmid was created by inserting a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag after the first methionine of full-length human NF2 cDNA (from D. H. Gutmann, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). NF2 S518A and NF2 S518D mutant constructs were made by polymerase chain reaction using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce the mutations were as follows (codon changes are underlined): forward primer S518A, 5′-GACATGAAGCGGCTTGCCATGGAGATAGAGAAAG-3′; reverse primer S518A, 5′-CTTTCTCTATCTCCATGGCAAGCCGCTTCATGTC-3′; forward primer S518D, 5′-GACATGAAGCGGCTTGACATGGAGATAGAGAAAG-3′; reverse primer S518D, 5′-CTTTCTCTATCTCCATGTCAGCCGCTTCATGTC-3′. A HA-tagged NF2-C construct, encoding the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 299–595) of merlin was generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3 vector. Then the HA-NF2-C was used as a template to create truncated forms of NF2, containing S518A (HA-NF2-C Ala518) or S518D (HA-NF2-C Asp518), by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. Authenticity of various wild-type and mutant forms of NF2 was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Other plasmids included constitutively active Rho GTPases: pCMV6-Myc-RhoA Q63L, pCGN-HA-Rac1 Q61L (from C. Der, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC), and pRK5-Myc-Cdc42 Q61L (from A.

NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Plasmid DNA was transfected into cells using GenePorter reagent (Gene Therapy System). After 24 h, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. For phosphatase treatment, lysates from NIH3T3 cells cotransfected with HA-NF2 and Rac1 Leu61 were precipitated with HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Babco). Aliquots of the precipitated protein were treated with buffer alone, with 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolabs) alone or with CIP plus 1 mm sodium vanadate and 10 mm NaF at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for Western blotting. Antibodies included anti-Myc 9E10 and anti-FLAG M5 (both from Sigma), anti-GST (Santa Cruz), anti-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling). Antibody detection was by means of an ECL Western analysis system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Human Pak2 cDNA was subcloned into the pET28 bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen). BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with this plasmid, and protein expression was induced by incubating a log phase culture in 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 30 °C. The recombinant protein was recovered by chromatographic purification on a Talon column (CLONTECH) using standard methods. The recombinant His6-tagged Pak2 was stored in 10-μl aliquots at −80 °C. Ser518 (wild-type), Ala518, and Asp518 forms of NF2-C (amino acid residues 299–595) were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Each immunoprecipitate was washed extensively and then incubated in 25 μl of protein kinase buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2) containing 20 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 60 ng of activated recombinant Pak2. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the autoradiogram was made from the dried gel. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-HA antibody to verify equivalent amounts of merlin substrate among reactions. Previous studies have demonstrated that merlin is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues and that merlin phosphorylation decreases with serum starvation, high cell density, or loss of adhesion (7Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Google Scholar). The ERM proteins play a role in cell surface dynamics and structure by linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane (8Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Google Scholar, 9Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Google Scholar) and are regulated by Rho signaling (4Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Google Scholar, 5Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Google Scholar, 10Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amono M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura R. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases play crucial roles in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian cells, and Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and can influence the motile and invasive properties of tumor cells in vitro (11Price L.S. Collard J.G. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 167-173Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that Rho GTPase signaling could regulate the phosphorylation status of merlin. NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-tagged NF2 and individual constitutively active Rho GTPase constructs. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and expression of merlin was examined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, exogenous merlin was detected as two mobility forms. In cells transfected with active RhoA (RhoA Q63L), merlin migrated as a single mobility form. However, in cells transfected with active Rac1 (Rac1 Q61L), and to a lesser extent, in cells transfected with active Cdc42 (Cdc42 Q61L), merlin migrated as a doublet consisting of faster and slower mobility bands. To investigate the nature of the slower migrating form of merlin, lysates from NIH3T3 cells cotransfected with HA-NF2 and Rac1 Leu61 were precipitated with anti-HA antibody. CIP treatment eliminated the slower migrating form of merlin, whereas phosphatase inhibitors reversed the dephosphorylation effect of CIP (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that the slower migrating band represents the phosphorylated form of merlin, which is induced by either active Rac1 or Cdc42. Earlier work identified several downstream target molecules of Rac. MLK3, a member of the mixed lineage kinase family, is able to associate with Rac and Cdc42 and, in turn, to activate JNK (12Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Google Scholar). Pak1, another effector of Rac, plays an important role in cell morphology and motility (6Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Google Scholar, 13Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Google Scholar, 14Manser E. Huang H.Y. Loo T.H.

To examine which effector mediates merlin phosphorylation by Rac, NIH3T3 cells and HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with HA-NF2, Rac1 Leu61, and a dominant negative form of MLK3 or Pak1 (Pak1-AID). Immunoblot analysis was performed as shown in Fig.2A. The slower mobility (phosphorylated) form of merlin induced by active Rac1 was inhibited by a dominant negative form of Pak1 containing the autoinhibitory domain (Pak1-AID) (16Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Google Scholar, 17Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar), but not by Pak1-AID L107F, which is known to block the autoinhibitory effect of Pak1-AID (17Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, the slower mobility form of merlin was partially blocked by dominant negative (kinase dead) MLK3. To confirm the involvement of Pak in merlin phosphorylation, we cotransfected HA-NF2 with the Rac effector mutant Rac1 V12L37, which is able to activate Pak1, or Rac1 V12H40, which cannot bind or activate Pak1 (18Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Google Scholar). Rac1 V12L37, but not Rac1 V12H40, stimulated merlin phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Next, we cotransfected HeLa cells with HA-NF2 and individual active forms of Pak1 (Pak1 L107F, Pak1 T423E, Pak1 165) or Pak2 (Pak2 T403E), or wild-type Pak6, each of which was able to stimulate phosphorylation of merlin (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained with NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results show that both group I Paks and group II Paks can induce phosphorylation of merlin. Because dominant negative MLK3 partially blocked merlin phosphorylation induced by Rac (Fig. 2A), we tested whether merlin can also be phosphorylated via MLK3 signaling. As shown in Fig. 2E, overexpression of MLK3 failed to stimulate merlin phosphorylation. Since MLK3 contains a partial CRIB (Cdc42-Rac interaction and binding) motif, the inhibitory effect of dominant negative MLK3 could be due to sequestering Rac from Pak. In addition, we determined that ROK, a downstream target of Rho, is also unable to stimulate merlin phosphorylation (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these findings indicate that merlin is phosphorylated by Rac specifically via Pak signaling. Shaw et al. (19Shaw R.J. Paez G.J. Curto M. Yaktine A. Pruitt W.M. Saotome I. O'Bryan J.P. Gupta V. Ratner N. Der C.J. Jacks T. McClatchey A.I. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 63-72Google Scholar) has also recently observed that merlin functions in Rac/Cdc42-dependent signaling, although that work did not link Rac and merlin signaling with Pak. Their investigations also demonstrated that Rac-induced phosphorylation of merlin, at Ser518, regulates its activity by weakening both its head-to-tail interaction and its association with the cytoskeleton. Since our data indicated that merlin is phosphorylated by Rac through Pak, we sought to determine whether Pak also phosphorylates merlin at Ser518. To test this possibility, merlin Ser518was mutated to an alanine (NF2 S518A), which could no longer be phosphorylated at this site, or aspartic acid (NF2 S518D), which could mimic the effect of phosphorylation. Active Rac1 or Pak1 was transiently cotransfected with wild-type NF2, NF2 S518A, or NF2 S518D, followed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3A, mutation of this site had no effect on the level of expression of merlin. However, in cells transfected with either active Rac1 or Pak1, the NF2 S518A mutant was refractory to phosphorylation as indicated by a single mobility form, whereas NF2 S518D consistently migrated as a doublet whether cotransfected with active Rac1 or Pak1 or when transfected alone. Next, we transfected constructs encoding truncated forms of merlin into HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis confirmed that truncated merlin Ser518, but not the mutant forms Ala518 or Asp518, is phosphorylated by Pak1 165. Collectively, these data indicate that merlin Ser518 is the phosphoacceptor site mediated not only by Rac, but also by Pak. To determine whether merlin can be phosphorylated by Pak in vitro, we performed an immunocomplex kinase assay. Because full-length merlin comigrates with Pak, we used truncated forms of merlin (NF2-C Ser518, NF2-C Ala518, NF2-C Asp518) as substrates. As demonstrated in Fig.3C, truncated merlin Ser518 was phosphorylated in the presence, but not in the absence, of active, recombinant Pak. Furthermore, truncated mutant forms of merlin (Ala518 and Asp518) were not phosphorylated by Pak. Collectively, these data indicate that Pak can directly phosphorylate merlin at serine 518. Previous work indicates that overexpression of merlin in rat schwannoma cells inhibits their growth (20Sherman L. Xu H.M. Geist R.T. Saporito-Irwin S. Howells N. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Gutmann D.H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2505-2509Google Scholar) and impairs cell motility, adhesion, and spreading (21Gutmann D.H. Sherman L. Seftor L. Haipek C. Lu K.H. Hendrix M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 267-275Google Scholar). Merlin is hypophosphorylated in connection with serum deprivation, high cell density, or loss of adhesion (7Shaw R.J. McClatchey A.I. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7757-7764Google Scholar). At low cell density, merlin is phosphorylated, growth-permissive, and exists in a complex with ezrin, moesin, and the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44 (22Morrison H. Sherman L.S. Legg J. Banine F. Isacke C. Haipek C.A. Gutmann D.H. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 968-980Google Scholar). These data indicate that the phosphorylation status of merlin specifies cell growth arrest or proliferation: i.e.hypophosphorylated merlin is growth-inhibitory and represents the functionally active tumor suppressor form of the protein, whereas hyperphosphorylation inactivates merlin and is growth-permissive. Merlin loss has been associated with a high metastatic potential in an animal model reported by McClatchey et al. (23McClatchey A.I. Saotome I. Mercer K. Crowley D. Gusella J.F. Bronson R.T. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1121-1133Google Scholar). The signal transduction studies presented here establish a framework for elucidating tumorigenic mechanisms involved in neoplasms associated with merlin inactivation. Interestingly, somatic mutations of merlin are common in human malignant mesothelioma (24Bianchi A.B. Mitsunaga S.-I. Cheng J.Q. Klein W.M. Jhanwar S.C. Seizinger B. Kley N. Klein-Szanto A.J.P. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10854-10858Google Scholar, 25Sekido Y. Pass H.I. Bader S. Mew D.J.Y. Christman M.F. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1227-1231Google Scholar), a highly invasive and metastatic tumor type. Merlin loss of function by either phosphorylation or biallelic inactivation may contribute to tumor growth and invasiveness/metastasis. Thus, our characterization of merlin phosphorylation by Rac through Pak provides new insights into the regulation of its tumor suppressor function. Importantly, Pak has been shown to regulate motility in mammalian cells (6Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Google Scholar), and activated Paks can be transforming (26Adam L. Vadlamudi R. Kondapaka S.B. Chernoff J. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28238-28246Google Scholar, 27Dan C. Kelly A. Bernard O. Minden A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32115-32121Google Scholar). These data raise the intriguing possibility that merlin inactivation by Pak may play a role in tumor cell spreading and metastasis."

We find that although pretreatment of BMMs with IL-4 does not alter M-CSF signaling, it reversibly blocks RANKL-dependent activation of the NF-κB, JNK, p38, and ERK signals. IL-4 also selectively inhibits TNF signaling, while enhancing that of IL-1. Contrary to previous reports, we find that MEK inhibitors dose-dependently inhibit OC differentiation. To identify more proximal signals mediating inhibition of OC formation by IL-4, we used mice lacking STAT6 or SHIP1, two adapter proteins that bind the IL-4 receptor. IL-4 fails to inhibit RANKL/M-CSF-induced osteoclastogenesis by BMMs derived from STAT6-, but not SHIP1-, knockout mice. Consistent with this observation, the inhibitory effects of IL-4 on RANKL-induced NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation are STAT6-dependent. We conclude that IL-4 reversibly arrests osteoclastogenesis in a STAT6-dependent manner by 1) preventing IκB phosphorylation and thus NF-κB activation, and 2) blockade of the JNK, p38, and ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

This Th2 cytokine functions as a growth and/or differentiation factor for a wide variety of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells (12Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The hematopoietic origin of osteoclasts has led to the hypothesis that IL-4 may play an important role in the regulation of bone metabolism. Indeed, IL-4 inhibits the in vitro bone resorption stimulated by various agents, and the inhibitory effect of IL-4 on bone resorption is abolished by a monoclonal anti-IL-4 antibody (13Watanabe K.

IL-4 also inhibits spontaneous and parathyroid hormone-related protein-stimulated osteoclast formation and modulates development of humoral hypercalcemia malignancy in intact mice (14Nakano Y.

Furthermore, IL-4 inhibits in vitro osteoclast formation by affecting the commitment of its precursors to the osteoclast (15Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.-L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although these observations establish IL-4 as a potent anti-bone resorption factor, the mechanism(s) by which IL-4 inhibits osteoclastogenesis remain poorly understood.

The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) mediating IL-4 inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. We find that IL-4 inhibits formation of osteoclasts (OCs) when murine OC precursors, namely bone marrow macrophage (BMMs), are treated with M-CSF and RANKL. The cytokine arrests multiple aspects of RANKL-induced signaling including the following: 1) preventing IκBα phosphorylation and thus NF-κB activation, and 2) blockade of the JNK, p38, and ERK MAP kinase pathways. In addition, IL-4 selectively inhibits TNF signaling and enhances that induced by IL-1 in BMMs. These inhibitory events of IL-4 on RANK signaling are reversible and require signal transducer and activator of transcription-6 (STAT6). In contrast, exposure of BMMs to IL-4 fails to impact those components of M-CSF-induced intracellular signaling relating to osteoclastogenesis, namely activation of the MAP kinase and Akt pathways. Polyclonal anti-IκBα, polyclonal anti-RANK, and polyclonal anti-TRAF6 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-IKKα and monoclonal anti-IKKβ antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).

Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Wild type C57BL/6 were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). STAT6- and SHIP1-deficient mice were kindly provided by Dr. James Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN) and Dr. Keith Humphries (British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada), respectively. BMMs were isolated from whole bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice and incubated in tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 24 h in culture, the non-adherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Paque gradient, and the cells at the gradient interface were collected. The cells were replated at 65,000/cm2 in α-minimal essential medium and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2in the presence of recombinant mouse M-CSF (10 ng/ml). Cells were stimulated with cytokines (M-CSF, RANKL, TNF, or IL-1) on day 4 or 5. In some experiments (for MEK1/2, MKK3/6, Akt activation, and M-CSF signaling), cells were cultured in serum and M-CSF-free medium for 24 h before stimulation. BMMs were cultured in 48- or 96-well cell culture dishes in the presence of M-CSF (10 ng/ml) and RANKL (40 ng/ml) and other cytokines as appropriate, and medium was changed on day 3. Osteoclast-like cells were characterized by staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The numbers of osteoclasts were assessed by TRAP solution assay as described previously (18Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T.

Cytokine-treated or control monolayers of BMMs were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in the buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Fifty μg of cell lysates were boiled in the presence of SDS sample buffer (0.5m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and incubated in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding. Membranes were then exposed to primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times, and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h. Membranes were washed extensively, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions. EMSA was performed as described previously (19Wei S. Wang M.W.-H. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lifted from the dish after treatment with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm EGTA in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated on ice for 15 min, and then Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 6.4%. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged, and nuclear proteins in the supernatant were transferred to fresh tubes. Nuclear extracts (3 μg) were incubated with an end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence 5′-AAACAGGGGGCTTTCCCTCCTC-3′ derived from the κB3 site of the TNF promoter (20Drouet C. Shakhov A.N. Jongeneel C.V. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1694-1700PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was performed in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were fractionated on a 4–20% TBE gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) and visualized by exposing dried gel to film. RNA was isolated using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed using 1 μg of total RNA, 0.5 μg of (dT)15 primer, 20 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor, 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase, 1× avian myeloblastosis virus-RT buffer (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 1 mm dNTP mix (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was carried out for 15 min at 42 °C, followed by 5 min at 99 °C, and then cooled to 4 °C. The RT reaction products were further diluted to 100 μl, and 1 μl of each was applied to a 49-μl volume PCR premix, containing 1 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, 5 units of Taqpolymerase, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1× PCR buffer (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out in a PCR Express thermal cycler (HYBAID, Franklin, MA) set for various cycles to monitor the linearity of the amplification, with annealing temperature at 60 °C. The oligonucleotide primers used are as follows: 1) IκBα, (5′) 5′-GCCTGGACTCCATGAAAGAC-3′ and (3′) 5′-CAAGTGGAGTGGAGTCTGCTGCAGGTTGTT-3′; 2) ICAM-1, (5′) 5′-CGGCTGGACGAGACGGACTG-3′ and (3′) 5′-GACGCTGCCATCACGAGGCC-3′; 3) TLR-2, (5′) 5′-GGAGACTCTGGAAGCAGGCG-3′ and (3′) 5′-GGCTTCCTCTTGGCCTGGAG-3′; and 4) α-actin, (5′) 5′-CATCGTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3′ and (3′) 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGG-3′. We and others (15Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.-L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Shioi A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Welgus H.G. Ohara J. Suzuki H. Lacey D.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have reported that IL-4 inhibits osteoclast formation when whole marrow is cultured with 1,25(OH)2D3 and dexamethasone. Thus, we first determined whether IL-4 inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by M-CSF and RANKL. As seen in Fig. 1, IL-4 inhibits formation of TRAP-positive multinucleated OCs when BMMs are exposed to optimal concentrations of M-CSF and RANKL. The effect occurs at the lowest dose of the cytokine used in these studies, indicating the potent nature of the inhibition. To determine at which stage IL-4 inhibits osteoclastogenesis, IL-4 was added to OC-generating cultures on days 0–4, and TRAP staining was performed on day 5. We find that the cytokine is effective only when present during the first 2 days of culture, suggesting it targets early OC precursors (Fig.2). To determine whether IL-4 inhibition of osteoclastogenesis is reversible, the cytokine was added at the beginning of OC-generating culture and withdrawn on day 3 or day 5 by medium change. Withdrawal of IL-4, up to 5 days after its addition, restores OC differentiation. Thus, inhibition of OC formation by IL-4 is reversible (Fig.3). To determine whether IL-4 affects M-CSF signaling, we examined M-CSF-induced intracellular signaling. Although M-CSF does not activate JNK1, as reported previously (22Jaworowski A. Wilson N.J. Christy E. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15127-15133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it activates JNK2, ERK1/2, and Akt, but not p38 or NF-κB (Fig. 4). Exposure of cells to IL-4 fails to impact these aspects of M-CSF-induced signaling (Fig. 4). Since generation of osteoclasts from myeloid precursors requires the activity of two cytokines, M-CSF and RANKL (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar, 2Ross F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which the anti-inflammatory cytokine decreases osteoclastogenesis is by blunting RANKL-stimulated signaling. Activation of RANKL signaling involves binding of the cytokine to its unique receptor RANK, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. To exclude the possibility that IL-4 impairs RANKL signaling by decreasing expression of RANK and/or TRAF6, a member of the TRAF superfamily that binds to RANK (23Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and is critical for osteoclastogenesis (24Naito A.

Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), we performed Western blot analysis of BMMs exposed to IL-4 for 3 days. As can be seen in Fig.5, levels of both the receptor and its immediate effector are unchanged with IL-4 treatment. RANKL, the key osteoclastogenic cytokine upon binding its unique receptor, RANK, activates three major intracellular signals. These signals are as follows: 1) the NF-κB pathway; 2) all three MAPK members, namely ERKs (p42/p44), SAPK/JNK, and p38 and; and 3) the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt axis (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2967) Google Scholar, 2Ross F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To define the molecular mechanism(s) by which IL-4 inhibits osteoclastogenesis, we examined each of the major RANKL-induced signaling pathways. Our findings confirm prior reports (19Wei S. Wang M.W.-H. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) that RANKL induces phosphorylation in BMMs of JNK, p38, ERK1/2, and IκBα, the latter prompting NF-κB translocation to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. While pretreatment of IL-4 for 1 h does not significantly affect any RANKL-induced signals, exposure to the cytokine for 24 h dampens phosphorylation of IκBα, thus decreasing degradation of this protein (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the extent of inhibition is greater when cells are exposed for 3 days (Fig. 6 B). Documenting that IL-4 inhibition of osteoclast formation is reversible, 24 h after withdrawal of the cytokine, after 3 days of exposure, completely normalizes RANKL-induced IκBα phosphorylation. Cytokine-induced phosphorylation of IκBα is mediated by a large complex in which the active components are IKKα and IKKβ (27Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that IL-4 decreases levels of IKKα and/or IKKβ, lysates from RANKL-treated BMMs pre-exposed to vehicle or IL-4 were subjected to Western blot analysis with IKK-specific antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 6 C, levels of neither IKKα nor and IKKβ are altered by IL-4. The fact that IL-4 pretreatment of BMMs decreases RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of IκBα should dampen nuclear translocation of NF-κB (27Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we performed EMSA for NF-κB by using nuclear extracts from BMMs pretreated with IL-4 or vehicle and then exposed to RANKL. We find a 70% decrease in binding of nuclear levels NF-κB to a consensus oligonucleotide (Fig.7 A), which should diminish transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. To test this hypothesis we used RT-PCR to measure mRNA levels of three NF-κB-dependent early response genes. Consistent with our prediction, IL-4 pretreatment decreases both basal and RANKL-stimulated mRNA levels of IκBα, ICAM-1, and TLR-2 (Fig. 7 B), all of which are transcriptionally activated by NF-κB (28Ito C.Y. Kazantsev A.G. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3787-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 29Roebuck K.A. Finnegan A. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 4516-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with IL-4 for 24 h also partially inhibits p38 activation, without significantly altering that of JNK or ERKs (Fig.8 A). Longer exposure to the cytokine (3 days) almost entirely blocks activation of JNK, p38, and ERK. Once again the alterations in MAP kinase activation, which mirror the effect of IL-4 on osteoclastogenesis, are reversed by withdrawal of the cytokine for 24 h (Fig. 8 B). Turning to effectors of the SAPK/JNK ERK and p38 pathways, IL-4 decreases RANKL-stimulated activation of SEK1/MKK4, which is upstream of JNK, MEK1/2, the kinases responsible for ERK activation, and MKK3/6, which enhance p38 activity (Fig. 8 C). RANKL blocks apoptosis by phosphorylating Akt/protein kinase B on serine 473 and threonine 308 through a signaling complex containing c-Src and TRAF6 (23Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To determine whether IL-4 alters RANKL-induced activation of the Akt pathway, we examined phosphorylation of Akt using antibodies specific for phosphothreonine 308. As seen in Fig.9, IL-4 alone stimulates Akt phosphorylation but does not alter subsequent RANKL-induced Akt activation in BMMs. We next asked whether the cytokine alters the signaling pathways induced by TNF, a molecule that synergizes with RANKL in stimulating osteoclastogenesis (7Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and IL-1, an inflammatory cytokine that induces mature osteoclast activation and, like RANKL, also signals via TRAF6 (31Jimi E.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). We find that IL-4 selectively inhibits TNF-induced signaling, because it decreases JNK, p38, and Akt activation but fails to inhibit that of ERKs and NF-κB (Fig.10 A). Interestingly, exposure of BMMs to IL-4 enhances IL-1-induced NF-κB and MAP kinase activation (Fig. 10 B). IL-1-induced Akt activation in BMMs was not detectable (data not shown). Thus, the results in Fig. 10, combined with those in Fig. 4, reflect the specificity of IL-4 inhibition of RANKL-induced signaling in relation to osteoclast differentiation. As shown in Fig. 8 A and by others (26Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada A. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), RANKL induces ERK activation, raising the possibility that activation of the ERK pathway plays a role in osteoclastogenesis. In contrast to a previous report (26Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada A. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), and consistent with our observation that IL-4 inhibits RANKL-induced ERK activation, we find that both PD98059, a MEK1-specific inhibitor, and U0126, which blunts both MEK1 and MEK2, dose-dependently inhibit OC formation (Fig. 11,A and B). Withdrawal of the MEK inhibitors substantially rescues OC formation (Fig. 11 C), demonstrating that, in the doses used, the inhibitors are non-toxic and ERK activation is required for osteoclastogenesis. IL-4 signal transduction is initiated by binding of the cytokine to its heterodimeric membrane receptor, comprising IL-4Rα, which binds the cytokine with high affinity and the γC chain, a protein common to other members of the IL-4 receptor family (12Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Receptor activation is followed by phosphorylation of both subunits, by Janus kinase, an event that initiates signaling by providing docking sites for adapter molecules or proteins capable of transducing signals. To date five adapters/transducers have been identified that bind the activated IL-4 r"

Thus for glycolytic cells such as white muscle fibers, glia cells, most tumor cells, and blood cells, as well as all other cells under hypoxic conditions, two lactic acids must exit the cell for each glucose utilized. In other tissues, lactic acid is transported into the cell for gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis (liver, kidney) or oxidation as a major respiratory fuel (heart, skeletal muscle, and brain) (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transport is mediated by a family of proton-linked MonoCarboxylateTransporters (MCTs)1 of which nine members have been identified (2Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), although only for MCTs 1–4 has transport of lactic acid been demonstrated directly (3Bröer S. Schneider H.P. Bröer A. Rahman B.

Consistent with this, we have shown that antibodies against CD-147 co-immunoprecipitated MCT1 and MCT4 but not MCT2.

These observations all imply a close association between CD147 and MCT1/MCT4 within the plasma membrane, but our data also suggested that this interaction is critical for the correct expression of MCT1 and MCT4 at the cell surface. Thus when CD147 was co-expressed with MCT1 or MCT4 in mammalian cell lines, both proteins were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane, and lactate transport activity was greatly increased. In contrast, when MCT1 or MCT4 was expressed in the absence of CD147, the proteins accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus rather than being expressed in active form in the plasma membrane (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that co-injection of Xenopus oocytes with MCT1 cRNA and an antisense cRNA to a Xenopus homologue of CD147 reduced MCT1 expression and activity (17Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 526P: 23PGoogle Scholar). These data imply that CD147 acts as a chaperone for MCT1 and MCT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. To study such interactions in a living cell in real time a non-invasive technique is required. In this paper we describe how this can be achieved using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two proteins tagged on their C or N termini with either the cyan (CFP) or yellow (YFP) variants of GFP. FRET between two fluorophores only occurs if they are less than 100 Å apart and in the right orientation. As such, it is able to provide valuable information about protein/protein interactions and associated conformational changes that may occur (18Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 19Clegg R.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). FRET has been used extensively to study interactions between soluble proteins or a membrane protein and a soluble protein binding partner (6Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H.

Nature. 2001; 411: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), but very few studies have successfully employed FRET to study the interaction of membrane proteins in their native environment (24Tertoolen L.G. Blanchetot C. Jiang G. Overvoorde J. Gadella Jr., T.W. Hunter T. Hertog Jd.J. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Gu C. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M. Curr.

To our knowledge this is the first report describing the use of FRET to detect an interaction between two distinct proteins that functionally associate in the plasma membrane, although oligomerization of the human serotonin transporter and the rat γ-aminobutyric acid transporter has been detected in this way (26Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We placed both MCT1 and CD147 in CFP and YFP expression vectors (CLONTECH) that allowed expression of the C- or N-terminally CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins, respectively;i.e. a total of eight constructs in all. The nomenclature used for these constructs is illustrated in Fig.1. In outline, MCT1nCFP or MCT1nYFP represents the N-terminal CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins, and MCT1cCFP and MCT1cYFP the corresponding C-terminal tagged proteins. CD147nCFP, CD147nYFP, CD147cCFP, and CD147cYFP represent the equivalent CD147 constructs. For MCT1cGFP, MCT1cCFP, and MCT1cYFP, the coding region of rat MCT1, previously cloned into the pCIneo mammalian expression vector (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR using primers modified by the addition of an EcoRI site at the 5′ end and removal of the stop codon plus addition of a SalI site at the 3′ end. Following PCR, fragments were digested with EcoRI andSalI and cloned in the correct reading frame into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-N1, pECFP-N1, and pEYFP-N1 vectors (CLONTECH). A similar procedure was used for CD147cCFP and CD147cYFP, but the 5′ and 3′ restriction sequences used were both EcoRI. For MCT1nCFP and MCT1nYFP, MCT1 was subcloned from pCIneo-MCT1 by cutting out the coding region withEcoRI and inserting in frame into the pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 vectors (CLONTECH). CD147nCFP and CD147nYFP were produced by PCR with primers that inserted EcoRI andBamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. Following PCR, fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in the correct reading frame into the corresponding sites of the pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 vectors. The resulting constructs were checked by sequencing and expressed in COS cells by a liposome-mediated transfection procedure as detailed below. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (from Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma). For FRET studies, coverslips were placed in 6-well tissue culture plates and seeded with 1–3 × 105 cells per well in 2 ml of complete medium, whereas for studies of lactate transport, 10-cm plates were seeded with 2–5 × 105 cells in 10 ml of complete medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator until they were 60–70% confluent, and then transfection was carried out essentially as described previously (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). DNA (2 μg) was mixed with 6 μl of FuGENE-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 100 μl of serum-free medium and incubated for 20 min before being added to the cells and incubating for 24 h. At this point the medium was replaced, and live imaging was performed after an additional 24 h. Cells were imaged at 37 °C in imaging buffer, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mmKCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 2 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.4, using one of two systems. The majority of experiments was performed with a Leica confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP2) attached to a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope and equipped with an argon laser (458-, 476-, 488-, 514-nm lines) and acousto-optic tunable filter to attenuate individual visible laser lines. For some photobleaching studies a Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope was employed with conventional excitation through specific filters for CFP, GFP, YFP, and image analysis was performed using Improvision OpenLab software. In both cases a 63 × 1.32 NA oil immersion objective was employed. Quantification of FRET was determined by measurement of the ratio of intensity of the fluorescence emission signal at 480 nm to 530 nm when excited at the CFP excitation wavelength (458 nm). The potential artifacts that may distort this value and the means of overcoming them are discussed in detail under “Results.” Initial rates of l-lactate transport into control and transfected COS cells were determined at 25 °C from the rate of intracellular acidification measured using the intracellular pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) as previously described (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Excitation was at 440 and 490 nm, emission was at >530 nm, and intracellular acidification was detected as an increase in the 440 nm/490 nm fluorescence ratio. The initial rate of this fluorescence ratio change (ΔF·s−1) is directly proportional to the rate of substrate-mediated proton transport expressed in nanomoles of protons per μl intracellular volume and was determined by fitting the data to a first order rate equation as described previously (27Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For Xenopus oocytes, transfection with MCT1cGFP was performed by microinjection of the cRNA synthesized by in vitro transcription, and initial rates of lactate transport were determined at 20 °C using BCECF fluorescence as described previously (5Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To confirm that attachment of a GFP to MCT1 does not alter the ability of the latter to act as a lactate transporter, we first expressed MCT1 with a C-terminal GFP in Xenopus oocytes. Transport activity was determined from the rate of decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) that accompanies proton-linked lactate entry, using BCECF as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are shown in Fig.2 and confirm that the MCT1-GFP construct is transporting lactate in a similar fashion to native MCT1 but with a slightly reduced affinity. Thus the Km value (± S.E.) of MCT1-GFP was 11 ± 2.1 mm compared with a value of 4.4 ± 0.7 mm for normal MCT1 (5Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Each one of the eight constructs was successfully expressed in COS cells and could be visualized in live cells by confocal microscopy. Some examples are illustrated in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. However, when expressed alone these constructs did not show a distinct membrane plasma membrane distribution but rather appeared to be associated with the perinuclear region (Golgi plus endoplasmic reticulum). This was particularly the case for MCT1 in agreement with our previous observations with untagged MCT1 (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Examples can be seen for MCT1cCFP and MCT1nCFP in Figs. 3 and4A, respectively. In contrast, when both an MCT1 and a CD147 construct were co-expressed, both proteins displayed a plasma membrane location as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4,C and D. Once again this is the same as observed for the untagged proteins (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and confirms that the CFP and YFP attached to the C and N termini do not interfere with the correct targeting of the proteins.Figure 5The use of photobleaching to confirm thatFRET is occurring. Cells were co-transfected with either MCT1nCFP and CD147cYFP (A) or MCT1nYFP and CD147cCFP (B) and imaged using either the Leica TCS-SP2 confocal microscope with excitation using the 458 and 514 nm laser lines as in Fig. 4(B) or the Leica DMIRBE inverted epifluorescence microscope with excitation at 440 ± 20 nm and 500 ± 25 nm (A). Imaging was performed before and after bleaching the YFP by exposure to the 514 nm laser line for 20 s (B) or the 500 nm excitation light for 30 s (A). Images are shown for both the CFP and YFP emission (480 and 530 nm, respectively) together with bar graphs of the ratio of the emission intensity before bleaching to that after bleaching. These data are given as means ± S.E. for 3 (A) or 10 (B) different cells. For A, ratios are for the whole cell fluorescence, whereas for B only a small portion of the plasma membrane was analyzed as indicated on the image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Fluorescence emission spectra of COS-7 cells expressing MCT1nCFP, CD147cYFP, and CD147nYFP alone or in combination. Transient transfection with the relevant constructs was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were imaged using the Leica confocal imaging spectrophotometer system (TCS-SP2) using the 458 nm and 514 nm lines of the laser to excite CFP and YFP, respectively. In each case, the intensity of the fluoresced light for the cell shown was determined over the range of wavelengths indicated. In the cells co-transfected with MCT1nCFP and CD147cYFP (fluorophores both intracellular) the decrease in 480 nm emission and increase in 530 nm emission implies that FRET is occurring (C). This was not observed when cells were co-transfected with MCT1cCFP and CD147nYFP (fluorophores intracellular and extracellular, respectively) as shown in D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that lactate transport was enhanced in those cells expressing both proteins, rates of transport were determined in a large number of individual cells using BCECF fluorescence. This was carried out with control cells or cells transfected with either MCT1cCFP alone or together with CD147cYFP. Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that such transient transfection only induced expression of the tagged proteins in a fraction of the cells; about 40–50% in singly transfected and 20–30% in dual transfected cells. Thus it was important to distinguish between non-transfected and transfected cells when analyzing rates of transport by individual cells. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the imaging system used for transport measurements was not sufficient to determine this directly from the CFP and YFP fluorescence. However, when rates of transport were determined it was clear that in cells transfected with both MCT1cYFP and CD147cCFP, about 25% exhibited greatly enhanced rates of transport as shown in Fig. 3. This is consistent with these cells expressing both MCT1cYFP and CD147cCFP in an active form. The emission spectra of CFP-tagged and YFP-tagged proteins were first determined in cells transfected with a single construct and excited with the laser lines appropriate for CFP and YFP (458 and 514 nm, respectively). Data for MCT1nCFP and CD147cYFP are illustrated in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively, and show that the two spectra are quite distinct with emission peaks at about 480 and 530 nm, respectively. For the measurement of FRET, cells expressing both CFP and YFP constructs were excited at 458 nm. If FRET occurs, a shift in the emission spectrum of the CFP construct should be observed as direct energy transfer occurs from the excited CFP to the YFP with subsequent emission of the fluorescent light at 530 nm rather than 480 nm. In cells expressing both MCT1nCFP and CD147cYFP, this was observed as a decrease in the 480 nm emission and an increase in the 530 nm emission compared with that seen with the CFP construct alone as shown in Fig. 4C. Thus the ratio of 480 nm to 530 nm emission intensity acts as an indicator of the extent of FRET. However, it is not possible to quantify the extent of FRET from this ratio alone because YFP is also excited by 458 nm light at a level about 30% of that induced at 514 nm. Such “bleed-through” will cause the absolute value of the ratio to be less than 2.5 even in the absence of FRET, and the magnitude of this decrease will be dependent on the expression level of the YFP construct relative to the CFP construct. Thus, if the expression of the YFP protein were to be greatly in excess of the CFP protein, discriminating between such bleed-through and real FRET would present a serious problem. For this reason conditions were optimized to ensure that expression of the YFP construct was less than or equal to that of the CFP construct. This was most readily achieved by using MCT1 constructs tagged with CFP and CD147 constructs tagged with YFP, although for completion all combinations were employed. In Table I we present summary data for the 480 nm:530 nm emission intensity ratio for all combinations of CFP and YFP constructs. The shaded boxes highlight situations in which the ratio is especially low, with values (± S.E. of (n) observations) of 0.39 ± 0.03 (6Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17221-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for CD147cYFP with MCT1nCFP, 0.28 ± 0.09 (6Kim D.K. Kanai Y. Chairoungdua A. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17221-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) for CD147cCFP with MCT1nYFP, 0.30 ± 0.10 (5Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) for CD147cCFP with MCT1cYFP, and 0.41 ± 0.05 (5Manning Fox J.E. Meredith D. Halestrap A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 285-293Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) for CD147cYFP with MCT1cCFP. Because the C terminus of CD147 and both the C and N terminus of MCT1 are intracellular, these all represent situations in which both fluorescent tags are intracellular. This is consistent with FRET occurring as a result of the close proximity of the C terminus of CD147 to both the C and N termini of MCT1. Furthermore, the low values are independent of whether the CFP and YFP are on CD147 or MCT1 as would be predicted for FRET. In contrast, much higher ratios were obtained when CD147nYFP was co-expressed with MCT1cCFP (Fig. 4D) or when other combinations of CD147 tagged with either CFP or YFP and either C- or N-terminally tagged MCT1 were co-expressed (Table I). These higher values are considered to represent situations in which FRET is not occurring and act as important negative controls. This is especially true when CD147 has its CFP or YFP attached to the N terminus that is extracellular and thus distant from either the C or N terminus of MCT1 in the cytosol. FRET is dependent on the two fluorophores being within 50–100 Å of each other (18Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 19Clegg R.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and this will not be possible under such conditions.Table IFRET measurements for all CFP and YFP-tagged constructs of MCT1 and CD147Cells were transiently co-transfected with the combinations of CFP- and YFP-tagged MCT1 and CD147 shown, and the intensity ratio for emission at 480 and 530 nm was determined for excitation with the 458-nm laser line. In co-transfections such as MCT1nCFP with MCT1nYFP or CD147nCFP with CD147nYFP, untagged MCT1 or CD147 was also transfected to ensure correct plasma membrane targeting of the tagged proteins. Indeed, cells were only analyzed when correct targeting of both tagged proteins to the plasma membrane was observed, because this was also a good indicator that both proteins were expressed at similar levels. Full emission spectra were obtained with excitation at 458 nm, and the intensity ratio for emission at 480 and 530 nm was calculated. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the number of observations shown, and the arrangement of the fluorophores is indicated schematically underneath to aid interpretation of the data. FRET is indicated by theshaded boxes. Open table in a new tab Cells were transiently co-transfected with the combinations of CFP- and YFP-tagged MCT1 and CD147 shown, and the intensity ratio for emission at 480 and 530 nm was determined for excitation with the 458-nm laser line. In co-transfections such as MCT1nCFP with MCT1nYFP or CD147nCFP with CD147nYFP, untagged MCT1 or CD147 was also transfected to ensure correct plasma membrane targeting of the tagged proteins. Indeed, cells were only analyzed when correct targeting of both tagged proteins to the plasma membrane was observed, because this was also a good indicator that both proteins were expressed at similar levels.

Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of the number of observations shown, and the arrangement of the fluorophores is indicated schematically underneath to aid interpretation of the data. FRET is indicated by theshaded boxes. To be more certain that the evidence for FRET described above is valid, we have employed photobleaching of the YFP using a high intensity exposure to the YFP excitation light. When CFP and YFP are exhibiting FRET, photobleaching of the YFP should lead to an increase in the 480 nm emission of the CFP protein. In Fig. 5 we illustrate that this is indeed the case. Two different fluorescence microscopes were used for these experiments. In panel A, a conventional fluorescence microscope was used in which control of the excitation wavelength could be optimized for the CFP and YFP excitation maxima using filters of 440 ± 21 nm and 500 ± 25 nm, respectively. The lower wavelength of the CFP excitation light minimizes bleed-through causing YFP excitation; this was not possible with the laser confocal microscope that was constrained by the available laser line (458 nm). It can be seen that following bleaching of the CD147cYFP, the 480 nm emission signal of the MCT1nCFP actually increased. If bleed-through were responsible for the apparent FRET it would be expected that the 480 nm emission signal would decrease in similar fashion to the 530 nm signal. Similar results were obtained when the experiments were performed with the laser confocal microscope (panel B). In this case the fluorescence signal from a small portion of the plasma membrane was analyzed to ensure that only properly targeted proteins were included. We have also investigated whether FRET occurs between CFP-CD147 and YFP-CD147 or between CFP-MCT1 and YFP-MCT1 when these proteins are expressed together. For this purpose it was also necessary to co-express untagged CD147 or MCT1 with the two tagged MCT1 or CD147 constructs to ensure correct translocation of all proteins to the plasma membrane. Data are shown for all combinations in Table I as 480 nm:530 nm fluorescence emission ratios. These data imply that FRET occurs between CD147cYFP and CD147cCFP (0.39 ± 0.04) but not between either CD147nCFP and CD147nYFP (0.72 ± 0.04), CD147nYFP and CD147cCFP (0.96 ± 0.05), or CD147nCFP and CD147cYFP (0.71 ± 0.04). For MCT1 there was no evidence for FRET between any combination of CFP and YFP constructs. It could be argued that the FRET signal was occurring as a result of the close proximity of proteins that are crowded together as a result of overexpression. Although this is unlikely in view of the negative controls described above, the possibility was further eliminated by co-expressing CFP and YFP constructs of CD2 and MCT1. CD2 is another single transmembrane-spanning member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that we have shown previously is unable to substitute for CD147 as a chaperone for correct MCT1 expression (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). We found that the most suitable levels of expression were obtained using the combination of CD2cCFP with MCT1nYFP, and data for these are shown in Fig.6. It is clear that there is no evidence for FRET under these conditions, despite both proteins being well expressed. It is becoming apparent that many transporters require ancillary proteins for their expression and correct function. Thus CD147 is associated with the lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and is required for their correct expression on the cell surface (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), whereas the 4F2 heavy chain (CD98) interacts with and regulates expression of a family of amino acid transporters (28Mastroberardino L.

Similarly, the translocation of the AE1 anion exchanger (Band 3) to the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes is greatly enhanced by co-expression of glycophorin, which may also modify the activity of AE1 (32Bruce L.J. Groves J.D. Okubo Y. Thilaganathan B. Tanner M.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 916-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the single-pass glycoprotein CD36 and a 12-pass protein have been implicated in long-chain fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane (33Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane receptors and ion channels have also been reported to associate with ancillary proteins that can modulate their activities (34Kafitz K.W. Rose C.R. Thoenen H. Konnerth A. Nature. 1999; 401: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 35McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). To study these interactions in living cells a non-invasive technique is required, and in this paper we describe how this can be achieved using FRET between CFP and YFP constructs of MCT1 and CD147. Our data demonstrate that FRET is observed when either the C or N terminus of MCT1 is tagged with CFP and YFP and co-expressed with CD147 tagged with YFP or CFP on the C terminus but not the N terminus. We have performed a wide range of controls to confirm the validity of the FRET data and to exclude the possibility that our data are an artifact of bleed-through of the CFP laser excitation to give direct excitation of YFP. These controls included the use of different CFP/YFP combinations, which exhibited different levels of expression and also YFP photobleaching that induced an enhancement of the CFP fluorescence. The possibility that FRET was the result of nonspecific interactions between proteins caused by overcrowding was rendered unlikely by the inability of CD2cCFP to exhibit FRET with MCT1nYFP. Furthermore, no FRET was observed when MCT1cCFP and MCT1cYFP were co-expressed together with CD147 to ensure that both the tagged proteins were properly targeted to the plasma membrane (Table I). In the absence of CD147 both the CFP and YFP-MCT1 accumulated in the perinuclear region (Figs. 3 and4), but again there was no evidence of FRET (data not shown). In the light of these controls we conclude that CD147 and MCT1 interact in such a way that CFP or YFP on either the C or N terminus of MCT1 can exhibit FRET with a fluorescent partner on the C terminus of CD147 but not its N terminus. This would indicate that the intracellular C terminus of CD147 is within 50–100 Å of the C and N termini of MCT1, both of which are also cystosolic. In contrast, as would be predicted, the N terminus of CD147, which is extracellular, does not interact in this way. Our data also allow us to draw conclusions about how two MCT1 molecules or two CD147 molecules interact with each other. Co-expression of CFP and YFP constructs of CD147 demonstrate that two CD147 molecules must be in close proximity such that their C termini but not their N termini interact with each other. These data would imply that CD147 is present in the membrane as a dimer (or higher oligomer). In contrast no such interactions are observed between any combination of CFP-MCT1 and YFP-MCT1 implying that their C and N termini are likely to be some distance apart. Fig. 7 presents a model that is consistent with our data of how MCT1 and CD147 may interact in the plasma membrane. The arrangement of the 12 transmembrane α helices should only be considered as illustrative because it is based on that of the Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli whose three-dimensional structure has been solved (36Williams K.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We suggest that each MCT1 interacts with a single CD147 that in turn forms a dimer with another CD147/MCT1 pair. Such a model would explain how cross-linking antibodies against CD147 cause both the CD147 and MCT1 to aggregate together as a single cap at one end of the cell (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), which would not be possible if the MCT1 interacted with a single CD147. CD147 and its homologues such as GP-70 possess immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular region, a short cytoplasmic tail, and a single transmembrane domain (11Fossum S. Mallett S. Barclay A.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region shows a very high degree of cross-species conservation (15Kasinrerk W. Fiebiger E. Stefanova I. Baumruker T. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 847-854PubMed Google Scholar) including a centrally positioned glutamic acid residue. A charged amino acid deep within the transmembrane region is a common feature of proteins with multiple transmembrane domains (38Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 71-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but unusual for a protein with a single transmembrane domain (39Green N.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), implying an important function. Thus, we have argued previously (16Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Halestrap A.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) that critical for the association of the two proteins is an interaction between this transmembrane domain of CD147 and a transmembrane domain of MCT1. This might be helix 8 that contains a conserved arginine known to be essential for normal transporter activity (37Rahman B. Schneider H.P. Bröer A. Deitmer J.W. Bröer S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11577-11584Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed we have created a glutamate to arginine mutant of CD147cYFP and found that this neither reaches the plasma membrane itself nor enables MCT1 to be expressed at the plasma membrane (data not shown). The model of Fig. 7 assumes that the transmembrane domain of CD147 and helix 8 of MCT1 are closely associated. This could allow the C terminus of CD147 (40 amino acids) and the N or C terminus of MCT1 (15 and 57 residues, respectively) to be close enough for FRET to occur between the attached CFP and YFP moieties.

https://openalex.org/W3104659546,"Clusters of galaxies are thought to contain about ten times as much dark matter as baryonic matter. The dark component therefore dominates the gravitational potential of a cluster, and the baryons confined by this potential radiate X-rays with a luminosity that depends mainly on the gas density in the cluster's core. Predictions of the X-rays' properties based on models of cluster formation do not, however, agree with the observations. If the models ignore the condensation of cooling gas into stars and feedback from the associated supernovae, they overestimate the X-ray luminosity because the density of the core gas is too high. An early episode of uniformly distributed supernova feedback could rectify this by heating the uncondensed gas and therefore making it harder to compress into the core, but such a process seems to require an implausibly large number of supernovae. Here we show how radiative cooling of intergalactic gas and subsequent supernova heating conspire to eliminate highly compressible low-entropy gas from the intracluster medium. This brings the core entropy and X-ray luminosities of clusters into agreement with the observations, in a way that depends little on the efficiency of supernova heating in the early Universe."
https://openalex.org/W2058419967,"Emotionally loaded visual stimuli have shown increased activation in visual and cortex limbic areas. However, differences in visual features of such images could confound these findings. In order to manipulate valence of stimuli while keeping visual features largely unchanged, we took advantage of an “expressional transfiguration” (ET) effect of faces. In addition, we used repetition effects, which enabled us to test more incisively the impact of the ET effect. Using the ET manipulation, we have shown that the activation in lateral occipital complex (LOC) was unaffected by valence attributes, but produced significant modulation of fMR adaptation. Contrary to LOC, amygdala activation was increased by ET manipulation unrelated to the adaptation. A correlation between amygdala and LOC adaptation points to a possible modulatory role of the amygdala upon visual cortex short-term plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2067754875,"Hereditary pancreatitis has been found to be associated with germline mutations in the cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) gene. Here we report a family with hereditary pancreatitis that carries a novel PRSS1 mutation (R122C). This mutation cannot be diagnosed with the conventional screening method using AflIII restriction enzyme digest. We therefore propose a new assay based on restriction enzyme digest with BstUI, a technique that permits detection of the novel R122C mutation in addition to the most common R122H mutation, and even in the presence of a recently reported neutral polymorphism that prevents its detection by the AflIII method. Recombinantly expressed R122C mutant human trypsinogen was found to undergo greatly reduced autoactivation and cathepsin B-induced activation, which is most likely caused by misfolding or disulfide mismatches of the mutant zymogen. The K m of R122C trypsin was found to be unchanged, but its k catwas reduced to 37% of the wild type. After correction for enterokinase activatable activity, and specifically in the absence of calcium, the R122C mutant was more resistant to autolysis than the wild type and autoactivated more rapidly at pH 8. Molecular modeling of the R122C mutant trypsin predicted an unimpaired active site but an altered stability of the calcium binding loop.

This previously unknown trypsinogen mutation is associated with hereditary pancreatitis, requires a novel diagnostic screening method, and, for the first time, raises the question whether a gain or a loss of trypsin function participates in the onset of pancreatitis. Hereditary pancreatitis was initially reported as a form of chronic pancreatitis that is clinically indistinguishable from other etiological varieties of the disease but is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (1Comfort M. Steinberg A. Gastroenterology. 1952; 21: 54-63Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Five years ago the genetic basis of the disease was firmly established when a germline mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) was found to associate with the disease phenotype (2Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A. Furey W. Sossenheimer M.J. Ulrich C.D. Martin S.P. Gates L.K., Jr. Amann S.T. Toskes P.P. Liddle R. McGrath K. Uomo G. Post J.C. Ehrlich G.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). In most cases the disease begins with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis in children and young adults and progresses to chronic pancreatitis with exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (3Sossenheimer M.J. Aston C.E. Preston R.A. Gates L.K., Jr. Ulrich C.D. Martin S.P. Zhang Y. Gorry M.C. Ehrlich G.D. Whitcomb D.C. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1997; 92: 1113-1116PubMed Google Scholar). The penetrance of the most common trypsinogen mutations is 80%, and, for yet unknown reasons, unaffected mutation carriers neither develop pathological changes in the pancreas nor share the increased pancreatic cancer risk of their affected relatives (4Lowenfels A.B. Maisonneuve P. DiMagno E.P. Elitsur Y. Gates L.K., Jr. Perrault J. Whitcomb D.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 5Lerch M.M. Ellis I. Whitcomb D.C.

The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms through which carriers of trypsinogen mutations develop pancreatitis are unknown. The most intuitive explanation would be that either one of these mutations leads to a gain of trypsin function, i.e. a more rapid or efficient intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation or an extended activity of trypsin resulting from impaired inactivation or autolysis (6Teich N. Ockenga J. Hoffmeister A. Manns M. Mossner J. Keim V. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys.

Trypsin would then, in analogy to the conditions in the small intestine, activate other digestive proteases in a cascade-like fashion and thus mediate acinar cell injury (11Saluja A.K. Bhagat L. Lee H.S. Bhatia M. Frossard J.L. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G835-G842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report a family with hereditary pancreatitis that differs from previously reported kindreds in several respects. 1) Affected patients carry a previously unreported Arg-122 → Cys mutation that cannot be detected with the conventional screening technique based on an AflIII restriction enzyme digest. 2) The penetrance of the disease phenotype appears to be lower than that of the most common PRSS1 mutations. 3) Molecular modeling suggests that this mutation does not impair the active site of cationic trypsin but could affect the calcium binding site of the molecule. 4) Recombinant Arg-122 → Cys trypsin was found to be more resistant to autoactivation as well as to autodegradation under defined experimental conditions and therefore raises the question whether a gain of trypsin function or a loss of trypsin function is involved in the onset of hereditary pancreatitis.RESULTSThe fact that our patient had developed chronic pancreatitis as an adult would not have suggested hereditary pancreatitis as a differential diagnosis, despite the fact that we could not identify any apparent risk factors for pancreatitis such as alcohol abuse or metabolic disorders. After it became apparent that his son also suffered from recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, we investigated the possibility of genetic alterations in the PRSS1 gene. When the most common hereditary pancreatitis-associated PRSS1 mutation (R122H) was not detected by standard AflIII restriction enzyme digest, the entire coding sequence of the PRSS1 gene was sequenced. Both patients were found to be carriers of a previously unreported C to T transition mutation at position 133,282 of the published genomic sequence (GenBank™ accession no. U66061; Fig.1). This mutation results in an arginine to cysteine amino acid substitution in position 122 (R122C) and therefore affects the same codon as the common R122H mutation. Among the first degree relatives of the patients, two more were found to be carriers of the same mutation (aged 25 and 45 years), but neither was aware of an episode of pancreatitis in the past (Fig. 1). In this particular kindred, this would indicate a disease penetrance of 50%, provided that neither of the two unaffected carriers develops pancreatitis later in life. The latter remains a distinct possibility because of the late symptom onset in both affected patients (at age 52 and 24 years, respectively).The C to T transition eliminates a single BstUI site in the PCR fragment of exon 3, which permits rapid screening for the new R122C mutation by a simple BstUI restriction digest without the need of DNA sequencing.To compare AflIII and BstUI in their ability to recognize clinically relevant trypsinogen mutations, we used PCR to amplify exon 3 from DNA of healthy controls, from known heterozygous carriers of R122H mutation, and from our patients who carried the R122C mutation, and performed restriction digests with both enzymes (Fig.2). As predicted by the sequence, theAflIII digest detected a restriction site in the R122H carrier, but failed to detect the R122C mutation. On the other hand, a complete BstUI digest was found only in the healthy control cDNA, whereas, in carriers of the R122H as well as the R122C mutation, the restriction site on one allele was destroyed and this resulted in the presence of an undigested PCR product in addition to the two restriction fragments of the wild-type allele. As indicated in Fig. 2, the same BstUI digest would also detect the mutation in the presence of a recently reported neutral polymorphism in exon 3 that is not disease-relevant but makes the common R122H mutation inaccessible for screening with AflIII (19Chen J.M. Raguenes O. Ferec C. Deprez P.H. Verellen-Dumoulin C. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: E36-E37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Howes N. Greenhalf W. Rutherford S. O'Donnell M. Mountford R.

Gut. 2000; 48: 247-250Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Characteristics of Recombinant Cys-122 TrypsinRecombinant wild-type and Cys-122 mutant human cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) were generated and purified on ecotin affinity columns. The full-length sequence as well as the amino acid exchange at position 122 are indicated in Fig. 3. Under reducing conditions both proteins appear to have the appropriate and identical molecular mass (Fig. 3). Under nonreducing conditions, the Cys-122 mutant runs somewhat more slowly, which could indicate that a significant proportion of the mutant protein is present in a different conformation or that disulfide mismatches have formed. When equal protein amounts of wild-type and Cys-122 trypsinogen were activated with bovine enterokinase at pH 8.0 and in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, only ∼40% of activity was generated from Cys-122 trypsinogen as compared with the wild type (end point measurements after 30-min incubation; data not shown). When we calculated the enzyme kinetics for wild-type and Cys-122 mutant trypsin, the K m values were not different between the two enzymes, but the k cat of Cys-122 trypsin amounted to only 37% of the wild-type (TableI). This suggests that only 37% of the mutant zymogens forms correctly folded active trypsin upon enterokinase activation and that the remaining portion is present in a conformation that renders the protein non-activatable. When equal protein amounts of wild-type and Cys-122 trypsinogen were studied for autoactivation in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ at pH 8.0 or at pH 5.0, only 20% or less of the activity of wild-type trypsinogen was found for the Cys-122 mutant (Fig. 4,A and B). When, on the other hand, autoactivation of the two trypsinogens was compared in fractions that were corrected for potential activity (normalized for enterokinase activatable trypsin activity), the results were rather different. In the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, autoactivation of Cys-122 trypsinogen proceeded only slightly faster than wild-type trypsinogen at either pH 5.0 or at pH 8.0 (Fig. 4, C and D). It must remain open whether this difference is biochemically meaningful in view of the wholly different protein concentrations that were used in the assay to correct for enterokinase activatable enzyme activity. In the presence of 1 mm EDTA, however, the Cys-122 trypsinogen autoactivated much more rapidly at pH 8.0, whereas autoactivation was found to proceed more or less at the same rate compared with wild-type trypsinogen at pH 5.0 (Fig. 4, E andF).Figure 3Protein sequence of recombinant human PRSS1 into which an arginine to cysteine mutation was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at codon 122. The corresponding, Coomassie-stained SDS gels under reducing and nonreducing conditions are shown on the right.

Activity was expressed as a percentage of total wild-type trypsin activity. Inpanels C and D, the same experiments (at pH 8.0 in C, and at pH 5.0 in D) were performed in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and in panels E (pH 8.0) and F (pH 5.0) in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, but the amount of zymogen was corrected for enterokinase activatable trypsin activity; accordingly, the results were expressed as percentage of the potential total activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Experiments that were performed to study the activation of trypsinogen by human cathepsin B resulted in similar enzyme kinetics as seen for enterokinase activation of trypsinogen, i.e. when equal protein amounts of wild-type and Cys-122 trypsinogen were activated with cathepsin B, the activation of the Cys-122 mutant was found to be dramatically reduced and only when the amounts of protein were corrected for enterokinase activatable (potential) activity did the mutant activate marginally faster (Fig.5 A). These results were independent of whether or not calcium was present or chelated with EDTA (data not shown). Another property of trypsin that could potentially confer a gain of function is the kinetic at which the active trypsin is inactivated or undergoes autolysis (15Várallyay É. Pál G. Patthy A. Szilágyi L. Gráf L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ or at pH 5.0, wild-type and Cys-122 trypsin were both found to be completely stable and did not undergo autolysis (data not shown; for wild type, see Refs. 7Sahin-Tóth M.

However, in the presence of EDTA and at pH 8.0, the Cys-122 mutant trypsin was found to be considerably more resistant to autolysis than the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5In the experiments in panel A, wild-type trypsinogen (dashed line) and Cys-122 trypsinogen (solid lines) were activated with human cathepsin B (0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 2 mmCaCl2) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cys-122 trypsinogen was either used at equal protein concentrations with wild-type trypsinogen (solid circles) or corrected for enterokinase activatable potential activity (solid triangles). At the indicated time intervals, 2-μl samples were withdrawn for trypsin activity determination. For autolysis studies in panel B, aliquots (final concentration, 2.5 μm) of wild-type trypsinogen (dashed line) and Cys-122 trypsinogen (solid line) were activated with enterokinase for 60 min at 22 °C in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 and at pH 8.0, and autocatalytic inactivation of trypsins was followed at 37 °C after addition of 10 mmEDTA (final concentration). Residual activities were expressed as a percentage of trypsin activity measured immediately after enterokinase activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Molecular ModelingThe structure of the wild-type PRSS1 in the front view (standard view, Fig.6 A) and side view (90° rotation along the y axis, Fig. 6 B) shows that Arg-122 is located at a considerable distance from the active site or the activation domain of trypsin and would therefore be unlikely to directly affect its catalytic activity. In both orientations it can be seen in close proximity to the calcium binding loop (70-loop) of trypsin. In view of this location at the exposed back of the molecule, a replacement of Arg-122 by cysteine could not only affect a potential hydrolysis site of trypsin (9Whitcomb D.C. Gut. 1999; 45: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Gaboriaud C. Serre L. Guy-Crotte O. Forest E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 995-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but would also permit the formation of disulfide bonds between two trypsinogen molecules or between trypsinogen and other proteins. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the reported PRSS1 structure (18Gaboriaud C. Serre L. Guy-Crotte O. Forest E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 995-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were superimposed and are shown together with the neighboring residues of Arg-122 within a distance of 8.0 Å in Fig. 6 C. Both structures are remarkably similar with exception of the arginine side chains at position 122 (orange and purple in Fig.6 C), which show a high temperature factor (>70 Å2). The fact that Arg-122 can exist in two different orientations in the crystal structure (18Gaboriaud C. Serre L. Guy-Crotte O. Forest E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 995-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) is surprising and reflects structural flexibility at this position. A rotamer search shows that alternative orientations of the side chain of Arg-122 could form favorable interactions with neighboring residues (i.e.hydrogen bonds to Gly-74 or Asn-84 and a charged hydrogen bond to Glu-82), which, in turn, would affect the conformation of the calcium-binding loop. When Arg-122 is replaced by cysteine (Fig.6 D), the formation of hydrogen bonds with the calcium binding loop is reduced. In the wild-type structure, Ca2+could stabilize the conformation of the 70-loop. In the absence of Ca2+, however, the interaction of Arg-122 with its neighboring residues could result in a different conformation of the 70-loop and therefore lead to an altered catalytic activity. Cysteine at position 122 could not participate in these predicted interactions, and the conformation of the 70-loop would thus remain unaltered in either the presence or absence of Ca2+.Figure 6A and B, three-dimensional view of the front (A) and side (B) of human cationic trypsinogen according to the crystallographic structure (18Gaboriaud C.

In relation to the active site and the activation domain, the arginine in codon 122 (purple) is found at the opposing surface or back side of the molecule and in close proximity to the 70-loop (calcium-binding loop).

Panel D shows that the mutation of Arg-122 to Cys would be predicted to change the hydrogen bonds pattern between the region of codon 122 and the calcium binding loop (70-loop) and potentially affect the conformation of the 70-loop.

Because pancreatitis has long been regarded as a disease that is caused by proteolytic autodigestion of the pancreas (21Chiari H. Z. Heilkunde. 1896; 17: 69-96Google Scholar) and because trypsin is known to be a potent activator of other pancreatic zymogens in the gut (22Rinderknecht H. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1986; 31: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the trypsinogen mutations that were found in association with hereditary pancreatitis confer a gain of enzymatic function (2Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A. Furey W. Sossenheimer M.J. Ulrich C.D. Martin S.P. Gates L.K., Jr. Amann S.T. Toskes P.P. Liddle R. McGrath K. Uomo G. Post J.C. Ehrlich G.D. Nat.

In vitro studies have analyzed the biochemistry of recombinant human trypsinogens, into which pancreatitis-associated mutations were introduced and found that, under defined experimental conditions, either a facilitated trypsinogen autoactivation or an extended trypsin activity can result (6Teich N. Ockenga J. Hoffmeister A. Manns M. Mossner J. Keim V. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 461-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 7Sahin-Tóth M. Tóth M. Biochem. Biophys.

Whether these experimental conditions reflect the highly compartmentalized situation under which protease activation begins intracellularly in vivo (23Krüger B. Albrecht E. Lerch M.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 43-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Krüger B. Weber I.A. Albrecht E. Mooren F.C. Lerch M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is presently unknown, but the above studies would suggest that either a more effective autoactivation of trypsinogen or an impaired inactivation of trypsin (by degradation or autolysis) would be involved in the onset of hereditary pancreatitis.A number of arguments, however, have been raised against the gain of trypsin function hypothesis of hereditary pancreatitis. The increased autoactivation of recombinant trypsinogen in in vitrostudies can be completely abolished by adding physiological concentrations of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (0.15m pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, 1 mtrypsinogen; Ref. 10Szilágyi L.

Statistically, most hereditary disorders are associated with loss of function mutations that render a specific protein either defective or impair its intracellular processing and targeting (25Scriver C.R.

It would therefore be easier to explain their common pathophysiology in terms of a loss of enzymatic function rather than through a gain of enzymatic function. In particular, one of these mutations (A16V) also affects the signal peptide cleavage site that is assumed to be involved in the correct processing of trypsinogen (26Witt H. Luck W. Becker M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Experiments in isolated pancreatic acini and lobules that studied thein vivo mechanisms of intracellular zymogen activation have shown that trypsin activity is neither required nor involved in the activation of other digestive proteases and that its most prominent role is in autodegradation (2929. Halangk, W., Krüger, B., Ruthenbürger, M., Stürzebecher, J., Albrecht, E., Lippert, H., Lerch, M. M. (2001) Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). This, in turn, would suggest that intracellular trypsin activity has a role in the defense against other, potentially more harmful, digestive proteases and that structural alterations that impair the function of trypsin would eliminate a protective mechanism rather than generate a triggering event for pancreatitis (30Lerch M.M. Gorelick F.S. Med. Clin. N. Am. 2000; 84: 549-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whether these experimental observations obtained on rodent pancreatic acini and lobules have any relevance to human hereditary pancreatitis is presently unknown and cannot be readily assumed without further evidence because human cationic trypsinogen has distinct characteristics in terms of its ability to autoactivate and to autodegrade (31Colomb E. Figarella C. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 570: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32Figarella C. Miszczuk-Jamska B. Barrett A.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1988; 369 suppl.: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar).The kindred reported here is interesting in several respects. The single nucleotide exchange is only one position upstream of the one found in the most common variety of hereditary pancreatitis and leads to an amino acid exchange at the same codon (R122C versusR122H). In terms of the diagnostic detection of the R122C mutation in patients suspected of suffering from hereditary pancreatitis, this mutation escapes the conventional screening method with theAflIII restriction enzyme digest (2Whitcomb D.C. Gorry M.C. Preston R.A. Furey W. Sossenheimer M.J. Ulrich C.D. Martin S.P. Gates L.K., Jr. Amann S.T. Toskes P.P. Liddle R. McGrath K. Uomo G. Post J.C. Ehrlich G.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). We therefore propose an alternative screening method using the restriction enzymeBstUI, which has the added advantage of simultaneously detecting the R122H and the R122C mutations, even in the presence of a recently reported neutral polymorphism that makes the R122H mutation inaccessible for screening with the AflIII technique (19Chen J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2092120029,"We have previously demonstrated that prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) induces a rapid and transient expression of Nur77 in luteal cells. We have shown that Nur77 plays an important role in ovarian physiology by mediating the PGF2α induction of 20α-HSD, a steroidogenic enzyme involved in the catabolism of progesterone. In this report we established, using luteinized granulosa cells, that PGF2αstimulates in vitro nur77 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Serial 5′-deletion of thenur77 promoter revealed that the necessary and sufficient elements for PGF2α induction of Nur77 promoter activity are located between the nucleotides −86 and −33 upstream of the transcription start site, this region containing two AP1 elements. JunD binds to these AP1 sites, but its binding is not stimulated by PGF2α. However, mutation of the AP1 sites as well as a dominant-negative JunD abolished nur77 induction by PGF2α. PGF2α induces phosphorylation of JunD bound to the nur77 promoter. Stimulation ofnur77 expression and JunD phosphorylation were prevented by inhibitors of calcium, calmodulin, or ERK1/2 kinase. PGF2α-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prevented by calcium/calmodulin inhibitors. We conclude that activation of JunD through a calmodulim-dependent activation of ERK1/2 mediates nur77 induction by PGF2α.

In the absence of fertilization and implantation, the corpus luteum loses the ability to secrete progesterone and undergoes luteolysis. Prostaglandin F2α(PGF2α)1 is involved in the inhibition of progesterone production and luteal regression in many mammalian species. Thus, PGF2α causes luteal regression in domestic ruminants (1Niswender G.D. Juengel J.L. Silva P.J. Rollyson M.K. McIntush E.W. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar); accordingly, administration of PGF2α to cycling cows is a common practice used to synchronize the sexual cycle for the purpose of artificial insemination (2Milvae R.A. Rev. Reprod. 2000; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In pregnant mice, the absence of PGF2α receptor causes a failure in parturition due to the lack of luteal regression and subsequent high levels of progesterone in circulation (3Sugimoto Y. Yamasaki A. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Aze Y. Nishimura T. Oida H. Yoshida N. Tanaka T. Katsuyama M. Hasumoto K. Murata T. Hirata M. Ushikubi F. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Science. 1997; 277: 681-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Human luteal cells also produce and respond to PGF2α with a decrease in progesterone production (4Tai C.J. Kang S.K. Choi K.C. Tzeng C.R. Leung P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar, 5Miceli F. Minici F. Garcia Pardo M. Navarra P. Proto C. Mancuso S. Lanzone A. Apa R. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

We have recently studied the mechanism by which PGF2αtriggers the fall in progesterone production by the corpus luteum at the end of pregnancy in rodents. We have shown that PGF2αinduces a rapid and massive expression of the luteal enzyme 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD) (7Stocco C.O. Zhong L. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Lau L.F. Gibori G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37202-37211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This enzyme catabolizes progesterone into an inactive metabolite, 20α-OH-progesterone, which cannot support pregnancy. Therefore, expression of 20α-HSD results in decreased luteal progesterone secretion and parturition (8Gibori G. Adashi E.Y. The Ovary. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 261-317Google Scholar, 9Albarracin C.T. Parmer T.G. Duan W.R. Nelson S.E. Gibori G. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2453-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have also established that PGF2α stimulation of the 20α-hsd gene requires the transcription factor Nur77, which is induced by PGF2α in the corpus luteum of pregnant rats prior to the induction of 20α-hsd (7Stocco C.O. Zhong L. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Lau L.F. Gibori G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37202-37211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanism by which PGF2α stimulates nur77 and20α-hsd gene expressions remains largely unknown. PGF2α-induced luteolysis is believed to be initiated through a receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C, which generates inositol (1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol. These second messengers in turn increase free intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively (10Leung P.C. Steele G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 476-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11McCracken J.A. Custer E.E. Lamsa J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 263-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The antisteroidogenic effects of PGF2α have been reported to be mediated by a PKC-dependent pathway, whereas loss of luteal cells appears to be due to [Ca2+]i (for review, see Ref. 1Niswender G.D. Juengel J.L. Silva P.J. Rollyson M.K. McIntush E.W. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that PGF2α activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade in bovine (12Chen D.B. Westfall S.D. Fong H.W. Roberson M.S. Davis J.S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3876-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and human (4Tai C.J. Kang S.K. Choi K.C. Tzeng C.R. Leung P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 375-380PubMed Google Scholar) luteal cells. However, little is known about the downstream signaling events that mediate the cellular responses or the signaling mechanisms by which PGF2α activates gene expression in the corpus luteum. Nur77 is an orphan nuclear steroid receptor and an immediate early gene whose synthesis is tightly regulated by extracellular signals. The regulation of Nur77 expression has been examined in other systems such as the adrenocortical derived cell line (Y1 cells), the pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, and immature thymocytes. In these systems, Nur77 expression is induced, respectively, by corticotropin via cAMP (13Wilson T.E. Mouw A.R. Weaver C.A. Milbrandt J. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), by nerve growth factor and membrane depolarization via Ca2+ and AP1 proteins (14Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and by T-cell receptors via Ca2+ (15Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). MAPK signaling has been shown to be involved in the induction of nur77 in excitable cells such as muscle and neuron cells (16van den Brink M.R. Kapeller R. Pratt J.C. Chang J.H. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11178-11185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Sakaue M. Adachi H. Dawson M. Jetten A.M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies suggested to us that PKC, [Ca2+]i, or MAPK signaling may also be involved in PGF2α induction of Nur77 in luteal cells. In this investigation, we examined the mechanism by which PGF2α signals to the nur77 and20α-hsd genes in luteinized granulosa cells. We have shown that PGF2α induces nur77 expression through a Ca2+-CaM-dependent activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway. ERK1/2 activation results in phosphorylation of the transcription factor JunD already bound to the Nur77 promoter. Nur77 activates the 20α-hsd gene causing the expression of this progesterone-catabolizing enzyme. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible mechanism by which Ca2+-CaM may mediate ERK1/2 kinase activation by PGF2α in ovarian cells.

The antibodies used were JunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-JunD (Ser100) or c-Jun (Ser73), (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), total ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology), and phospho-ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The blots were exposed to primary and secondary antibodies according to manufacturer's protocols. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized using Western blotting Luminol Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The band densities were determined by digital analysis using a Kodak Digital Science DC 120 Zoom Digital Camera and Kodak Digital Science 1D 2.0.2 software (Eastman Kodak Co.). To prepare nuclear cell extracts, 100-mm plates of luteinized granulosa cells at 70–80% of confluence were used. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C by scraping and centrifuging for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and placed in an orbital rocker for 20 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was obtained by centrifugation for 30 s at 12,000 × g at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge and resuspended in solution B, which was similar to solution A except that it contained 420 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) glycerol and no KCl. The solution was vigorously vortexed for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant containing nuclear extract was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. 2.5–4.0 μg of nuclear extract were incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 μg/ul of poly(dI-dC), and 4% glycerol) for 20 min. Excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or specific antibodies were added prior to addition of the labeled probe corresponding to the region −45 to −26 of the Nur77 promoter, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 22 °C. The DNA-protein complexes were separated from the unbound DNA probe by nondenaturing PAGE (4% gel) at 4 °C, in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA buffer. Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR reaction were performed as described previously (7Stocco C.O. Zhong L. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Lau L.F. Gibori G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37202-37211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For co-amplification of Nur77 and L19 message, the primers used were 5′-TCT GCT CAG GCC TGG TGC TAC-3′ and 5′-GGC ACC AAG TCC TCC AGC TTG-3′ and 5′-GGA CAG AGT CCA AGG GTC CGC TGC AGTC-3′ and 5′-TCC AAG GGT CCG CTG CAG TC-3′, respectively. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test was used for the statistical analysis of relative mRNA expression and luciferase activity data using the Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. We first examined whether luteinized granulosa cells can be used in primary culture to explore PGF2α signaling to thenur77 gene. The results show that PGF2αinduces nur77 expression in luteinized granulosa cells in a time- (Fig. 1A) and dose- (Fig. 1B) dependent manner. To examine whether PGF2αstimulation of nur77 depends upon de novo protein synthesis, the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the nur77 gene induction by PGF2α was examined. Luteinized granulosa cells were treated with 5 μm PGF2α in the presence (Fig. 1C,lanes 3, 5, 7, and 8) or absence (lanes 1, 2, 4, and6) of cycloheximide (10 mg/ml) for different times. Treatment with PGF2α in the presence of cycloheximide induced significantly higher nur77 gene expression than PGF2α alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 3,5, and 7 versus lanes 2, 4, and 6). Additionally, in the presence of cycloheximide, Nur77 mRNA levels remained elevated after 3 h of PGF2α treatment (Fig. 1C, lanes 5and 7). Treatment with cycloheximide alone for 3 h increased nur77 expression (Fig. 1C, lane 8). To examine the mechanism of nur77 induction by PGF2α, luteinized granulosa cells were transfected with a reporter construct containing the Nur77 promoter region spanning from −1200 to +120 bp (1.2-kb Nur7-luc), where +1 represents the transcription start site. Cells were also transfected with a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase, allowing for normalization of transfection efficiencies. Using this promoter, we observed a 7-fold stimulation of luciferase activity following treatment with PGF2α (Fig. 2A). A marked decrease in PGF2α stimulation was observed upon deletion of the −1200- to −294-bp region. Further deletions of this promoter revealed that the minimal and necessary elements for PGF2α stimulation are located between the −86 and −33 region, since deletion of this region totally abolished the stimulatory effect of PGF2α (Fig. 2A). Time course experiments (Fig. 2B) revealed a rapid stimulation of the 1.2-kb Nur77-luc reporter construct by PGF2α, with a 3-fold induction within 1 h of treatment. Maximal stimulation was observed 3 h after treatment with no further increase at 6 h. In contrast, when two smaller (−206 and −86 bp) Nur77-luc constructs were used, no stimulation was observed after 1 h of treatment. However, PGF2αstimulated the activity of these constructs 3 and 6 h after treatment in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). As shown previously, no stimulation of the −33-bp promoter was observed at any time studied (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the PGF2α-sensitive region, nucleotides −86 to −33, revealed the presence of two putative AP1 binding sites (Fig.2C). Mutations of either the distal (Fig. 2C,lane 3) or the proximal (Fig. 2C, lane 4) AP1 binding sites in the −86-bp Nur77-luc construct profoundly decreased the induction of luciferase activity by PGF2α, and mutation of both AP1 sites (Fig. 2C,lane 5) fully prevented PGF2α stimulation. To determine the transcription factors that bind to the AP1 sites, we performed gel shift assays using an oligonucleotide containing the proximal AP1 site as a probe. Nuclear extracts from luteinized granulosa cells treated with either PGF2α or vehicle both contained a specific protein able to bind to this probe (Fig.3A, lanes 1 and 2). Addition of excess of a cold oligonucleotide containing the proximal AP1 site (lanes 3 and 4) or the distal AP1 site (data not shown) totally inhibited this binding, indicating that both AP1 sites may mediate the effect of PGF2α in agreement with the mutation studies showed in Fig. 2C. Studies by Sharma and Richards (20Sharma S.C. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33718-33728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) using Western blot and gel shift analysis have revealed that JunD and FRA2 are major components of the AP1-DNA binding complex in luteinized granulosa cells, whereasc-jun and c-fos are expressed at low levels. Therefore, we examined first whether these AP1 proteins may bind to this AP1 site by adding specifics antibodies to the gel shift reaction. Whereas no supershift was observed with the FRA2 antibody (Fig.3A, lanes 7 and 8), a strong supershift was seen after the addition of a JunD antibody to the nuclear extracts from both control and PGF2α-treated cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). The addition of c-Jun or c-Fos antibodies to the gel shift reaction did not cause a supershifted band (data not shown), confirming previous results showing that neither c-Jun nor c-Fos bind to the AP1 binding site located in the Nur77 promoter (14Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicate that JunD binds to the Nur77 promoter, but this binding is not stimulated by PGF2α. When nuclear extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a pan JunD antibody, we confirmed (Fig.3A, lower panel) that JunD is constitutively present in the nuclear fraction of granulosa cells and that its expression is not affected by PGF2α. Since we could not demonstrate a causative relationship betweennur77 expression and increased JunD DNA binding, we then hypothesized that PGF2α may increase JunD activity. Transcriptional activity of JunD can be regulated by phosphorylation of serine residues located in the amino-terminal domain (21Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 22Pyrzynska B. Mosieniak G. Kaminska B. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Most notable in this regard are regulatory phosphorylations occurring on Ser90 and Ser100 within the transactivation domain (23Yazgan O. Pfarr C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 916-920PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested whether PGF2αinduces the phosphorylation of the JunD protein bound to the Nur77 promoter, by adding a phospho-JunD (Ser100) antibody to the gel shift reaction. This antibody caused a prominent supershift when added to nuclear extract from PGF2α-treated cells (Fig.3B, top panel: lane 4). However, this supershifted band was much less evident when nuclear extract from vehicle-treated cells were used. Accordingly, when nuclear extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, the phospho-JunD protein was detectable only in cells treated with PGF2α(Fig. 3B, lower panel). The amount of total JunD remained the same regardless of PGF2α treatment, as shown by the use of a pan JunD antibody. To confirm the participation of JunD in the induction of Nur77 by PGF2α, we sought to determine whether the induction ofnur77 expression could be altered by a dominant-negative mutant JunD (DN-JunD). Luteinized granulosa cells were transfected with either a dominant-negative JunD expression vector, or with empty vector, and were treated with or without PGF2α (Fig.4A). This DN-JunD protein is lacking its DNA binding domain but retains the capacity to form homodimers and heterodimers (14Yoon J.K. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A,left panel, the strong induction of the endogenousnur77 gene by PGF2α was inhibited by DN-JunD in a dose-dependent manner. Additional cells were co-transfected with the −86-bp Nur77-luc reporter construct and with either the DN-JunD expression vector or empty vector. They were then treated with either vehicle or PGF2α (Fig.4A, right panel). DN-JunD protein inhibited the PGF2α-induced −86-bp Nur77-luc reporter construct activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4A, right panel). At a 1-μg concentration the DN-JunD expression vector completely abolished this induction. To further investigate the role of JunD protein in the PGF2α-mediated stimulation of nur77, we overexpressed a wild type JunD protein in luteinized granulosa cells and treated the cells with either vehicle of PGF2α. As shown in Fig. 4B, overexpression of JunD had no effect on either the 1.2-kb (left panel) or the −86-bp (right panel) Nur77-luc reporter construct activity. However, when cells transfected with JunD were treated with PGF2α, a remarkable increase in promoter activity was observed. The induction of Nur77 promoter activity in JunD-transfected and PGF2α-treated cells was severalfold higher than in nontransfected cells treated with PGF2α. These results indicate that JunD is necessary, but not enough, to inducenur77 expression and that phosphorylation of the already present JunD protein by PGF2α is essential for the activation of the nur77 gene. To further study the functional role of JunD Ser100phosphorylation in the induction of nur77 by PGF2α, a plasmid encoding a modified JunD protein in which the serine 100 residue has been replaced by alanine (JunDAla) was introduced into luteinized granulosa cell. Mutation of serine to alanine in the AP1 proteins prevents phosphorylation of the mutated residue (24Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). No synergism between the overexpression of JunDAla and PGF2α treatment in the induction of the 1.2-kb and −86-bp Nur77-luc construct activity was observed (Fig. 4B), further establishing the importance of JunD phosphorylation in the PGF2αstimulation of nur77 expression. We next examined the intracellular mechanism by which PGF2α may induce phosphorylation of JunD and nur77 expression. Two known intracellular mediators of PGF2α action in the corpus luteum are PKC and Ca2+ (1Niswender G.D. Juengel J.L. Silva P.J. Rollyson M.K. McIntush E.W. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 11McCracken J.A. Custer E.E. Lamsa J.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 263-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 25Davis J.S.

To examine whether the PKC pathway is involved, we either treated granulosa cells with the PKC inhibitors (staurosporine or calphostin C), or we depleted PKC via a long term treatment with PMA. Then PGF2α was added to the medium at a concentration or 5 μm, and the cells were cultured for 1 h before mRNA isolation. As expected, PGF2α induced Nur77; however, neither staurosporine, calphostin C, nor sustained PMA treatment affected PGF2α stimulation of nur77 (Fig.5A). To test whether Ca2+ is involved, we used the membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM (25 μm), to inhibit free intracellular Ca2+, and either the Ca2+ ionophores A23187 (1 mm) or ionomicyn (2 μm) to increase intracellular Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 5B, PGF2α induction of Nur77 mRNA expression was completely prevented by BAPTA/AM, whereas A23187 was able to induce endogenous Nur77 expression as effectively as PGF2α. Similar results were also obtained with ionomicyn (data not shown). To further investigate the lack of participation of PKC activation in the induction of Nur77 by PGF2α, luteinized granulosa cells were treated with two different PKC activators, PMA or phorbol 12,"
https://openalex.org/W2017203551,"The BRG-1 subunit of the SWI·SNF complex is involved in chromatin remodeling and has been implicated in the action of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB). Given the importance of BRG-1 in RB function, germ line BRG-1 mutations in tumorigenesis may be tantamount to RB inactivation. Therefore, in this study we assessed the behavior of cells harboring discrete BRG-1 alleles for the RB-signaling pathway. Using p16ink4a, an upstream activator of endogenous RB, or a constitutively active RB construct (PSM-RB), we determined that the majority of tumor lines with germ line defects in BRG-1 were sensitive to RB-mediated cell cycle arrest. By contrast, A427 (lung carcinoma) cells were resistant to expression of p16ink4a and PSM-RB. Analysis of the SWI·SNF subunits in the different tumor lines revealed that A427 are deficient for BRG-1 and its homologue, Brm, whereas RB-sensitive cell lines retained Brm expression. Similarly, the RB-resistant SW13 and C33A cell lines were also deficient for both BRG-1/Brm. Reintroduction of either BRG-1 or Brm into A427 or C33A cells restored RB-mediated signaling to cyclin A to cause cell cycle arrest. Consistent with this compensatory role, we observed that Brm could also drive expression of CD44. We also determined that loss of these core SWI·SNF subunits renders SW13 cells resistant to activation of the RB pathway by the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, since reintroduction of either BRG-1 or Brm into SW13 cells restored the cisplatin DNA-damage checkpoint. Together, these data demonstrate that Brm can compensate for BRG-1 loss as pertains to RB sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2108737135,"The bacterial twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway has been recently described for PhoD of Bacillus subtilis, a phosphodiesterase containing a twin-arginine signal peptide. The expression of phoD is co-regulated with the expression of tatAd andtatCd genes localized downstream ofphoD. To characterize the specificity of PhoD transport further, translocation of PhoD was investigated in Escherichia coli. By using gene fusions, we analyzed the particular role of the signal peptide and the mature region of PhoD in canalizing the transport route. A hybrid protein consisting of the signal peptide of β-lactamase and mature PhoD was transported in a Sec-dependent manner indicating that the mature part of PhoD does not contain information canalizing the selected translocation route. Pre-PhoD, as well as a fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD (SPPhoD) and β-galactosidase (LacZ), remained cytosolic in the E. coli. Thus, SPPhoD is not recognized by E. coli transport systems. Co-expression of B. subtilis tatAd/Cd genes resulted in the processing of SPPhoD-LacZ and periplasmic localization of LacZ illustrating a close substrate specificity of the TatAd/Cd transport system. While blockage of the Sec-dependent transport did not affect the localization of SPPhoD-LacZ, translocation and processing was dependent on the pH gradient of the cytosolic membrane. Thus, the minimal requirement of a functional Tat-dependent protein translocation system consists of a twin-arginine signal peptide-containing Tat substrate, its specific TatA/C proteins, and the pH gradient across the cytosolic membrane.

Chloroplast cpTatC has been described recently as the ortholog ofE. coli TatC (12Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). While TatB and TatC appear to play a pivotal role in the Tat-dependent protein translocation inE. coli, TatA and TatE seem to fulfill complementary functions as the deletion of TatA or TatE does not block export, while the TatA/TatE double deletion drastically inhibits export (7Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Expression studies suggested that tatE may be a cryptic gene duplication of tatA (13Jack R.L. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Sawers G. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). An in vitroreconstituted translocation system demonstrated the necessity of TatA, TatB, and TatC for a functional E. coliTat-dependent translocation system (14Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The information about the structure of the Tat translocase is contradictory. While Bolhuis et al. (15Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) suggested that TatB and TatC proteins form a functional and structural unit of the E. coli Tat translocase, a recent report from Sargent et al. (16Sargent F. De Gohlke U. Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) demonstrated a double-layered ring structure with a central cavity of a complex consisting of TatA and TatB. The presence of genes encoding TatA- and TatC-like proteins as well as the synthesis of exported proteins containing twin-arginine signal peptides are strong indications for the existence of the Tat pathway in eubacteria (17Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 5: 260-274Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). While most of the bacteria contain one copy oftatA and one copy of tatC (5Wu L.F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar) sequencing of bacilli genomes (i.e. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, and Bacillus stearothermophilus) indicated the presence of multiple TatA and TatC proteins. In particular,B. subtilis contains two tatC- and threetatA-like genes (18Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V. Carter N.M. Choi S.K. Codani J.J. Connerton I.F. Danchin A. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar). Both tatC genes are localized directly downstream from a tatA gene (19Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A TatB-like protein appears to be absent from bacilli. The recently described transport of PhoD of B. subtilisrevealed that TatC could act as a specificity determinant for this process. While the inactivation of the tatCdcompletely inhibited the secretion of PhoD, the inactivation of the second tatC gene (tatCy) had no effect on the secretion of PhoD (19Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This observation was the first indication for the existence of multiple Tat pathways in a single bacterial cell with separate substrate specificity. PhoD is a secretory protein with a twin-arginine signal peptide. We have shown previously that it is efficiently transported across the cytosolic membrane but only inefficiently processed. Slow processing of the enzymatically active precursor was shown to keep the protein at the outer surface of the cell envelope (20Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The tatA/tatC gene pair (designated tatAd/Cd), localized downstream from phoD, is co-regulated with the expression of phoD (19Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of the PhoD transport further, we analyzed its transport in E. coli. By using gene fusion technology the particular role of the signal peptide and the mature region of PhoD in canalizing the transport was investigated. A fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of β-lactamase (Bla) and mature PhoD was transported in a Sec-dependent manner. PhoD, as well as the fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD (SPPhoD) and LacZ, was shown to be export-incompetent in E. coli. The co-expression of thephoD-associated B. subtilis gene pairtatAd/Cd resulted in the processing and the translocation of SPPhoD-LacZ. This transport was shown to be ΔpH-dependent. Since the transport of SPPhoD-LacZ was independent of E. coli tat genes, the minimal requirement of a Tat transport system consists of a twin-arginine signal peptide-containing substrate, an adopted TatA/C pair, and the pH gradient across the bacterial cytosolic membrane.

Procedures for DNA purification, restriction, ligation, agarose gel electrophoresis, and transformation of E. coli were carried out as described in Sambrooket al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were from MBI Fermentas. PCR was carried out with the VENT DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). To construct pAR3phoD, the phoD gene including its ribosome binding site was amplified from the chromosome of B. subtilis strain 168 by PCR using the primers P1 (5′-GAG GAT CCA TGA GGA GAG AGG GGA TCT TGA ATG GCA TAC GAC-3′) containing aBamHI site and P2 (5′-CGA TCC TGC AGG ACC TCA TCG GAT TGC-3′) containing a PstI site. The amplified fragment was cleaved with BamHI and PstI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pAR3. The resulting plasmid pAR3phoDallowed the arabinose-inducible expression of wild type phoDin E. coli. To construct a gene fusion between bla and phoDgenes, phoD deleted for its signal sequence was amplified using primer P3 (5′-GTA GGA TCC GCG CCT AAC TTC TCA AGC-3′) containing a BamHI site and primer P2 containing aPstI site. The amplified fragment was cleaved withBamHI and PstI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pUC19, resulting in plasmid pUC19′phoD. Next the 5′-region of β-lactamase encoding its signal sequence was amplified from plasmid pBR322 by PCR with primer B1 (5′-ATA GAA TTC AAA AAG GAA GAG TAT G-3′) containing an EcoRI site and primer B2 (5′-CTG GGG ATC CAA AAA CAG GAA GGC-3′) containing a BamHI site. The amplified PCR fragment was cleaved with BamHI andEcoRI and inserted into pUC19′phoD, cleaved with the same restriction enzymes, which resulted in plasmid pUC19bla-phoD. For easy selection of recombinant clones, plasmid pORI24, containing a tetracycline resistance gene, was inserted 3′ of the bla-phoD gene fusion using an unique PstI site. From the resulting plasmid pUC19bla-phoD-Tc anEcoRI-BglII fragment containingbla-phoD and the tetracycline resistance gene of pORI24 was isolated and inserted into pMUTIN2 cleaved withEcoRI and BamHI. In the plasmid pMutin2bla-phoD thebla-phoD gene fusion is under control of the IPTG-inducible PSPAC promoter. To construct a gene fusion consisting of the signal sequence ofphoD and lacZ, a DNA fragment encoding the signal peptide of PhoD and the translational start site of phoD was amplified by PCR with primer P1 containing a BamHI site and primer P4 (5′-GAG AAG GTC GAC GCA GCA TTT ACT TCA AAG GCC CC-3′) containing a SalI site and inserted into the corresponding sites of pORI24 resulting in plasmid pORI24phoD′. Next, thelacZ gene lacking nine 5′-terminal codons was amplified using primer L1 (5′-ACC GGG TCG ACC GTC GTT TTA CAA CG-3′) containing aSalI site and primer L2 (5′-GGG AAT TCA TGG CCT GCC CGG TT-3′) containing an EcoRI site and subsequently inserted into the corresponding sites of pORI24phoD′. The resulting plasmid pORI24phoD′-lacZ was linearized withBamHI and inserted into pAR3 cleaved with BglII. The resulting plasmid pAR3phoD′-lacZ allows the arabinose-inducible expression of the phoD′-lacZgene fusion. To obtain a plasmid that mediates an inducible overexpression oftatAd/tatCd of B. subtilis, the DNA region containing these genes including their ribosome binding sites was amplified by PCR with the primer T1 (5′-CAA GGA TCC CGA ATT AAG GAG TGG-3′) containing a BamHI site and primer T2 (5′-GGT CTG CAG CTG CAC TAA GCG GCC GCC-3′) containing aPstI site. The amplified fragment was cleaved withBamHI and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pQE9 (Qiagen) resulting in pQE9tatAd/Cd. To obtain TG1 ΔtatABCDE, plasmids pFAT44 and subsequently pFAT126 covering in-frame deletions of E. coli tatE andtatABCD genes, respectively, were transferred to the chromosome of TG1 as described (7Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Mutant strain TG1 ΔtatABCDE was verified phenotypically by mutant cell septation phenotype, hypersensitivity to SDS, and resistance to P1 phages as described previously (23Stanley N.R. Findlay K. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schüll) as described by Towbin et al. (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected using specific antibodies against PhoD (20Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), β-galactosidase (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), pro-OmpA (provided by R. Freudl), SecB (laboratory collection), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Pulse-labeling experiments of E. coli strains were performed as described earlier (21Müller J. Walter F. van Dijl J.M. Behnke D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cultures were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine and chased with unlabeled methionine, and then samples were taken at the times indicated immediately followed by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (0 °C). After cell lysis proteins were precipitated with specific antibodies against PhoD (20Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), OmpA, β-galactosidase, or β-lactamase (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc.). Relative amounts of radioactivity were estimated by using a phosphorimaging system (Fuji) and the associated image analytical software PC-BAS. In vivo protease mapping was carried out according to Kiefer et al. (26Kiefer D. Hu X. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For spheroplast formation, cells were grown in TY medium to exponential growth. To induce the plasmid-encoded genes the medium was supplemented with arabinose (0.2%) and/or IPTG (1 mm) for 60 min. After spheroplast formation cells were treated with proteinase K (Sigma) or with proteinase K and Triton X-100 or remained untreated. PhoD or SPPhoD-LacZ were detected by Western blotting. Detection of cytosolic SecB revealed the proteinase K resistance of Triton X-100-untreated spheroplasts. The initial aim was to test whether PhoD could be exported by the Tat pathway in E. coli. For this purpose we placed the gene encoding this peptide under the control of the PBAD promoter ofSalmonella typhimurium localized at plasmid pAR3 (27Perez-Perez J. Gutierrez J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid allowed the arabinose-inducible enzymatically active production of PhoD in E. coli TG1 (data not shown). Since phosphodiesterase is highly toxic to E. coli after induction of PhoD synthesis cell growth immediately ceased. To assay transport of PhoD in E. coli TG1(pARphoD) pulse-chase experiments were performed. As shown in Fig.1A no processing of the wild type pre-PhoD was observed even 60 min after chase, indicating that pre-PhoD was not translocated by the E. coli Tat machinery. Localization of PhoD was further analyzed by in vivoprotease mapping. As shown in Fig. 1B pre-PhoD was not accessible to proteinase K at the outer side of the cytosolic membrane, demonstrating that PhoD remained in a cytosolic localization. Absence of pre-PhoD processing in E. coli could be due to inefficient recognition of the signal peptide of PhoD by the E. coli Tat machinery or due to the nature of the mature part of the PhoD peptide. This B. subtilisprotein could have unexpected folding characteristics or the necessity of cofactors not present in E. coli. To address this question, the DNA encoding the mature peptide of PhoD was fused to the region encoding the signal peptide of β-lactamase (SPBla). The resulting gene fusion was cloned into the pMUTIN2 vector containing an IPTG-inducible PSPACpromoter allowing the synthesis of the SPBla-PhoD peptide. The transport and processing of this fusion protein was analyzed by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts of E. colistrain TG1(pMUTIN2bla-phoD). As shown in Fig.2A, lane 2, SPBla-PhoD was completely converted to a protein with a molecular weight of mature PhoD indicating the efficient transport of the protein. To elucidate the export path used for SPBla-PhoD translocation, Sec-dependent transport was selectively inhibited by addition of sodium azide. While the presence of sodium azide abolished conversion of SPBla-PhoD to PhoD, addition of nigericin did not retard processing of SPBla-PhoD (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). To analyze the Sec dependence of SPBla-PhoD transport in a more detailed manner, expression of bla-phoD in E. coliTG1(pMUTIN2bla-phoD) was induced in the presence or absence of sodium azide, pulse-labeling with [35S]-methionine was carried out, and PhoD was subsequently immunoprecipitated. Fig. 2B demonstrates the kinetics of conversion of SPBla-PhoD to mature PhoD. The presence of sodium azide significantly retarded maturation of SPBla-PhoD (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate that azide was effective in inhibiting Sec-dependent translocation, the processing of pro-OmpA was monitored from the same cultures. While in untreated culture pro-OmpA was quickly converted into its mature form, in the azide-treated culture processing of pro-OmpA was efficiently retarded (Fig. 2, D and E). These data indicate that PhoD can be transported in E. coli in a Sec-dependent manner. Thus, it can be concluded that the mature PhoD peptide is not canalizing the export route and does not prevent efficient transport or processing. It has been shown that signal peptides containing a twin-arginine motif can canalize transport of heterologous proteins via the Tat-dependent translocation route (for a review, see Ref. 5Wu L.F. Ize B. Chanal A. Quentin Y. Fichant G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 2: 179-189PubMed Google Scholar). The signal peptide of the E. coli trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (TorA) has been successfully used to mediate Tat-dependent transport of the thylakoidal protein 23K, the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase ofZymomonas mobilis and green fluorescent protein (3Wexler M. Bogsch E.G. Klösgen R.B. Palmer T. Robinson C. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Sargent F. Bogsch E.G. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 28Blaudeck N. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. Wiegert T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,29Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To test whether the signal peptide of PhoD is recognized by theE. coli Tat machinery and could canalize the transport of a protein in E. coli, we constructed a gene fusion consisting of the DNA region encoding the signal peptide of PhoD (SPPhoD) and the lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase as a reporter protein. The gene hybrid was inserted into plasmid pAR3 resulting in plasmid pAR3phoD′-lacZ. Induction of production of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein in E. coliTG1 resulted in LacZ+ colonies (data not shown). Hence, correct folding and tetramerization of the peptide as a prerequisite for its activity does occur in E. coli. To analyze whether the signal peptide of PhoD could mediate translocation of LacZ into a extracytosolic localization, we studied localization of LacZ by using in vivo protease mapping. As shown in Fig. 3A no processing of SPPhoD-LacZ could be observed. The SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein was not susceptible to protease digestion in spheroplasts. When spheroplasts were destroyed by addition of Triton X-100, the unprocessed SPPhoD-LacZ protein became protease-sensitive. The reliability of the method was verified by using the cytosolic protein SecB as internal control. In spheroplasts SecB was resistant to proteinase K but was digested after solubilizing the spheroplasts with Triton X-100. The data demonstrated above indicate that the Tat system of E. coli does not mediate transport of pre-PhoD or of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein. Absence of translocation could be due to the necessity of additional components for the translocation of PhoD present only in B. subtilis or due to the specificity of recognition of pre-PhoD as a Tat-dependent substrate. To test the latter hypothesis, theB. subtilis tatAd/Cd gene pair was coexpressed in E. coli strains TG1(pARphoD) and TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ). To study the effect of TatAd/Cd proteins on localization of PhoD, strain TG1(pARphoD, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) expression of phoD as well astatAd/Cd was induced with arabinose and IPTG. Unexpectedly, no PhoD could be detected in strain TG1(pARphoD, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) using Western blotting (data not shown). Induction of TatAd/Cd proteins in strain TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) resulted in stable co-production of TatAd/Cd and SPPhoD-LacZ (data not shown). SPPhoD-LacZ processing was analyzed in the presence and absence of TatAd/Cd using pulse-chase labeling and subsequent immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against LacZ. While in TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ) no processing of SPPhoD-LacZ could be observed (Fig.4A), in strain TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) the peptide was at least partially processed (Fig. 4B). Since processing of the translocation product is an indication of membrane translocation but does not necessarily prove that export of the protein has occurred, we examined whether LacZ was localized in the periplasmic space in TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd). To monitor localization of the LacZ peptide, cells of strain TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) were converted to spheroplasts and treated with proteinase K. As shown in Fig. 3B after co-expression oftatAd/Cd, SPPhoD-LacZ was completely susceptible to protease digestion in spheroplasts. Unexpectedly, both the processed form and the precursor of the fusion protein were accessible to the protease treatment. The presence of SecB after proteinase K treatment demonstrated the stability of spheroplasts. These results clearly show that the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein is exported into the periplasmic space of E. coli when the B. subtilis tatAd/Cd genes are co-expressed. To directly prove that the membrane translocation of the system is dependent on the pH gradient across the cytosolic membrane, Sec- or Tat-dependent protein translocation pathways were selectively blocked. Localization of SPPhoD-LacZ in TG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) was detected by Western blotting after in vivo protease mapping. Nigericin, an ionophore inhibiting the Tat-dependent protein translocation as a result of dissipating the ΔpH (30Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), did efficiently block both processing and translocation of SPPhoD-LacZ (Fig.5A). The addition of an equal volume of methanol used to disperse nigericin had no effect on localization of SPPhoD-LacZ (data not shown). Treatment of the culture with sodium azide, which inhibits Sec-dependent protein export by interfering with the translocation-ATPase activity of the SecA protein (31Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), did result in accumulation of pro-OmpA but did not affect the localization and the processing of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein (Fig. 5B). To exclude co-operative action of B. subtilis and E. coli Tat proteins, E. colistrain TG1 was deleted for tatABCDE genes and subsequently transformed with plasmids pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, and pQE9tatA/Cd. Processing and localization of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein was analyzed under identical conditions as described for the E. coli tat+ strain. As shown in Fig.6 in the absence of the E. coli tatABCDE genes most of SPPhoD-LacZ was protease-accessible demonstrating the extracytosolic localization of the fusion protein. The resistance of SecB to the proteolytic digestion demonstrated the stability of the spheroplasts (Fig. 6). Surprisingly, no processing of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein could be observed in the absence of tatABCDE. In the present report we have shown that the export signals of PhoD, a Tat-dependent transported phosphodiesterase ofB. subtilis, was incompatible with the Tat machinery ofE. coli. While the mature part of PhoD could be exported efficiently with the help of the export signals of Sec-dependent β-lactamase, wild type PhoD or a fusion protein consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD and LacZ remained cytosolic. The co-expression of the phoD-associated genestatAd and tatCd mediated the Tat-dependent translocation of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein. Since transport of SPPhoD-LacZ was blocked in the presence of nigericin but not in the presence of sodium azide, it can be concluded that SPPhoD-LacZ is transported in a Sec-independent manner. Transport of SPPhoD-LacZ in an E. coli tatABCDEstrain revealed that transport was independent of the E. coli Tat components. These data show that the minimal requirement of a specific Tat-dependent protein translocation system is consisting of a pair of TatA and TatC proteins, a signal peptide specifically recognized by these Tat components, and the existence of the ΔpH gradient across the cytosolic membrane. PhoD as well as SPPhoD-LacZ is not recognized by theE. coli Tat system. Our previous results obtained inB. subtilis revealed that transport of PhoD is mediated by TatCd but is independent of the TatCy protein (19Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These observations implied that B. subtilis contains at least two specific routes for Tat translocation. Further, E. coli tat strains could not be complemented by its B. subtilis Tat proteins (19Jongbloed J.D.H. Martin U. Antelmann H. Hecker M. Tjalsma H. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. Müller J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41350-41357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Finally, absence of E. coli tat genes did not prevent TatAd/Cd-mediated transport of SPPhoD-LacZ in E. coli. These data strongly implicated that transport of hybrid peptides consisting of the signal peptide of PhoD, the reporter protein, and the TatAd/Cd protein pair form an autonomous Tat translocation system, and the recognition of Tat substrates is a selective process determined by multiple special protein-protein interactions between a given Tat substrate and its specific Tat proteins. Most of the twin-arginine signal peptide-containing E. coliprecursors associate in the cytosol with cofactors (17Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 5: 260-274Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). As shown for a mutant glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, association with its cofactor NADP was a prerequisite for the efficient export of the protein (30Santini C.L. Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We currently cannot exclude that PhoD needs the association of cofactors prior to translocation. Since the protein could be exported efficiently by using the Sec-dependent signal peptide of β-lactamase, necessity of a B. subtilis-specific cofactor association prior to transport appears to be unlikely. The efficiency of SPBla-PhoD processing in E. coli far exceeded transport kinetics observed for wild type PhoD observed in the gene donor strain. While the half-life of pre-PhoD in B. subtilis far exceeded 40 min (20Müller J.P. Wagner M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the half-life of the SPBla-PhoD precursor in E. coli was about 10 min. Slow processing kinetics of pre-PhoD could be due to slower transport kinetics of the Tat pathway compared with the efficient Sec-dependent pathway. Overexpression of phoD inE. coli was highly toxic for the cell. Immediately after induction of PhoD synthesis cell growth was blocked. Most likely cytosolic phosphodiesterase activity was highly detrimental forE. coli. After co-expression oftatAd/Cd no PhoD could be detected by using Western blotting. Co-expression of TatAd/Cd proteins obviously resulted in additional impairment of cell viability preventing further protein synthesis of PhoD or raising protease degradation of the heterologous peptide. The induction of the SPPhoD-LacZ fusion protein was not lethal for the E. coli cell. Several signal peptide-LacZ fusion proteins were previously used for studies of the Sec-dependent protein transport in E. coli. These fusion proteins were usually not transported through the cytosolic membrane. High level induction of these proteins was frequently detrimental for E. coli due to jamming of the Sec machinery (32Bassford Jr., P.J. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 19-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Rasmussen B.A. Bankaitis V.A. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 612-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tommassen J.

Induction of production of SPPhoD-LacZ was not toxic for E. coli either in the absence or in the presence of B. subtilis TatAd/Cdproteins. Since SPPhoD is not recognized by the E. coli Sec or Tat machinery the fusion protein remained cytosolic. Co-induction of B. subtilis TatAd/Cdproteins transported SPPhoD-LacZ independent of E. coli-specific transport paths. Therefore, its translocation did not interfere with essential export functions of the cell. Tat-mediated export of LacZ is consistent with the capacity of the Tat translocation system to transport proteins that are probably folded prior to translocation. Despite the fact that SPPhoD-LacZ was partially processed only in E. coliTG1(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd), the protein was entirely proteinase K-accessible. This observation indicates that the TatAd/Cd components transport the protein efficiently through the cytosolic membrane, but cleavage of the signal peptide by E. coli LepB was inefficient. In E. coli TG1 ΔtatABCE(pARphoD′-lacZ, pREP4, pQE9tatAd/Cd) no processing of SPPhoD-LacZ could be observed. At the moment there is no experimental knowledge about whether, when, and how theE. coli leader peptidase LepB cleaves signal peptides of Tat substrates. The presence of E. coli Tat components could be a prerequisite for cleavage of twin-arginine leader peptides by LepB.

https://openalex.org/W1685359092,"Because there is a theoretical possibility that the British national sheep flock is infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), we examined the extent of a putative epidemic. An age cohort analysis based on numbers of infected cattle, dose responses of cattle and sheep to BSE, levels of exposure to infected feed, and number of BSE-susceptible sheep in the United Kingdom showed that at the putative epidemic peak in 1990, the number of cases of BSE-infected sheep would have ranged from fewer than 10 to about 1500. The model predicts that fewer than 20 clinical cases of BSE in sheep would be expected in 2001 if maternal transmission occurred at a rate of 10%. Although there are large uncertainties in the parameter estimates, all indications are that current prevalence is low; however, a simple model of flock-to-flock BSE transmission shows that horizontal transmission, if it has occurred, could eventually cause a large epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2110515054,"We have attempted to elucidate an involvement of cathepsin E (CE) in major histocompatibility complex class II-mediated antigen presentation by microglia.

In contrast to CD, CE has a limited distribution in tissues and cell types such as lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal tracts, blood cells, and microglia (1Muto N. Yamamoto M. Tani S. Yonezawa S. J.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular localization and molecular form of CE in microglia contrast sharply with those in other tissues and cell types. CE is mainly localized in the endosomal structures possibly as the mature form in microglia (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas this enzyme was found to be localized in various cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus as the enzymatically inactive proform in other tissues and cell types (4Sastradipura D.F.

The localization of CE in the endosomal system has been also demonstrated in antigen-presenting B cells lymphoblasts (7Bennett K. Levine T. Ellis J.S. Peanasky R.J. Samloff I.M. Kay J. Chain B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus it is conceivable that the mature form of CE is closely associated with endosomal localization of this enzyme because the proform of CE appears to be converted into mature form only after entering in intracellular acidic compartments. Microglia are known to interact with invaded CD4+ T helper (Th) cells in the central nervous system (8Hickey W.F. Kimura H.

Despite the strategic localization of CE in microglia, no information is available about the involvement of CE in MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation by microglia.There is increasing evidence that two classes of intracellular proteases, aspartic and cysteine proteases, are involved in proteolytic steps required for MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation. On the basis of studies utilizing specific inhibitors or cathepsin-deficient mice, cathepsin L (CL) and cathepsin S (CS), lysosomal cysteine proteases have been recently demonstrated to be responsible for the terminal degradation of Ii to class II-associated Ii peptide (CLIP) during maturation of MHC class II molecules in the thymus and the peripheral lymphoid organs, respectively (16Riese R.J.

On the other hand, aspartic protease inhibitors such as pepstatin A have been shown to prevent antigen processing and Ii degradation (24Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, CD has been reported to generate antigenic peptides from OVA or hen egg lysozyme that could be presented to T cells (27Diment S. J.

More recently, however, the experiments conducted with splenocytes and macrophages prepared from CD-deficient (CD−/−) mice have concluded that CD is dispensable for degradation of Ii and processing of a number of exogenous and endogenous antigens (17Villadangos J.A.

These observations may suggest that CE plays a pivotal role in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation as an aspartic protease. To elucidate a specific involvement of CE and CD in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation by microglia, we conducted experiments utilizing specific inhibitors for cathepsins, purified enzymes and microglia prepared from CD−/− mice.DISCUSSIONOur observations here show that CE exists in murine microglia/macrophages as the mature enzyme, whereas this enzyme exists in other peripheral APCs such as splenocytes and BMCs as enzymatically inactive proform. The difference in molecular form of CE among APCs is considered to reflect the difference in its intracellular localization, because CE was found to be converted into the mature form in an autocatalytic manner only after entering acidic compartments such as endosomes (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression level of CE mRNA in microglia was found to be markedly increased upon stimulation with IFN-γ which is well known to induce MHC class II expression as well as co-stimulatory molecule which are required for Th cell activation (43De Simone R. Giampaolo A. Giometto B. Gallo P. Levi G. Peschle C. Aloisi F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Aloisi F. Ria F. Penna G. Adorini L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4671-4680PubMed Google Scholar). These unique properties of CE in microglia/macrophages prompted us to further investigate the role of CE in the MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation by microglia. The involvement of CE in antigen presentation of OVA by microglia was first assessed by using pepstatin A, a specific inhibitor of aspartic proteases. Pepstatin A inhibited the processing of OVA, but not inhibited the presentation of OVA antigenic peptide. The possible involvement of pepstatin A-sensitive aspartic proteases in the processing of antigenic peptide of native OVA was further substantiated by the present observations that digested fragments of native OVA by CE or CD could be recognized by OVA-specific Th cell hybridomas. In the present study, we could obtain no evidence indicating the involvement of aspartic proteases in the processing of Ii chain. However, there are several discrepant reports showing that aspartic protease inhibitors effectively prevented the processing of Ii chain (24Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Zhang T. Maekawa Y. Yasumoto K. Ishikawa H. Fawzy N.B. Dainichi T. Hisaeda H. Sakai T. Kasai M. Mizouchi T. Asano T. Katunuma N. Himeno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One reason for this discrepancy may be that aspartic proteases are involved in antigen presentation by microglia in a different way from that by peripheral APCs such as B cells. Additional experiments are necessary to elucidate this deduction.Our observations here further showed that microglia isolated from CD−/− mice retained an ability for antigen presentation. This is consistent with recent studies utilizing peripheral APCs prepared from CD−/− mice indicating that CD is not involved in degradation of Ii chain or generation of antigenic peptides (17Villadangos J.A. Riese R.J. Peters C. Chapman H.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 549-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Deussing J. Roth W. Saftig P. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Villadangos J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The present finding that pepstatin A inhibited the antigen presentation of OVA by microglia suggest that CE is essentially involved in processing of OVA because CD and CE are only known for pepstatin A-sensitive endosomal/lysosomal aspartic proteases in mammalian cells. Recent evidence has also shown that CE is closely linked with the proteolytic processing of tetanus toxin (45Hewitt E.W. Treumann A. Morrice N. Tatnell P.J. Kay J. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4693-4699PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that agrees with a role for CE in antigen processing. CE is expressed in APCs such as Langerhans cells and B cells (26Sealy L. Mota F. Rayment N. Tatnell P. Kay J. Chain B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1838-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 46Solcia E. Paulli M. Silini E. Fiocca R. Finzi G. Kindl S. Boveri E. Bosi F. Cornaggia M. Capella C. Samloff I.M. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that CE is responsible for the processing of OVA in A20 cells (7Bennett K. Levine T. Ellis J.S. Peanasky R.J. Samloff I.M. Kay J. Chain B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although CE in B cells is found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and endosome-like compartment (26Sealy L. Mota F. Rayment N. Tatnell P. Kay J. Chain B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1838-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the distinct subcellular localization and molecular form is unclear. We have previously reported that CE was found to be localized in the early endosome as well as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of primary cultured rat microglia (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely to consider that the expression of CE in activated microglia is mainly associated with processing of endocytic antigen into the endosomal compartments. The requirement of CE for the processing of exogenous antigens in microglia is to be further elucidated in future studies utilizing CE−/− mice that have been under generation.Although cysteine proteases are considered to be critical for the terminal step of Ii breakdown, their exact role varies among different APCs (14Villadangos J.A.

In B cells and dendritic cells, CS exclusively mediates the degradation of Ii to CLIP. For this purpose, thymic cortical cells and macrophages use CL and cathepsin F, respectively. Microglia have been suggested to use CS or CL for the degradation of Ii to CLIP, because microglia express CS and CL, but not cathepsin F (47Gresser O. Weber E. Hellwing A. Riese S. Régnier-Vigouroux A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,48Santambrogio L. Belyanskaya S.L. Fischer F.R. Cipriani B. Brosnan C.F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Stern L.J. Strominger J.L. Riese R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To address this suggestion, we conducted experiments utilizing specific inhibitors for cysteine proteases and found that the degradation of Ii to CLIP in microglia was mediated by both CS and CB but not CL. Similar results were also obtained when peripheral macrophages were used as APCs. Although there is increasing evidence that microglia is distinct from peripheral macrophages in various aspects, microglia were found to closely resemble peripheral macrophages as APCs.

In contrast to CD, CE has a limited distribution in tissues and cell types such as lymphoid tissues, gastrointestinal tracts, blood cells, and microglia (1Muto N. Yamamoto M. Tani S. Yonezawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 2Sakai H. Saku T. Kato Y. Yamamoto K. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular localization and molecular form of CE in microglia contrast sharply with those in other tissues and cell types. CE is mainly localized in the endosomal structures possibly as the mature form in microglia (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas this enzyme was found to be localized in various cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus as the enzymatically inactive proform in other tissues and cell types (4Sastradipura D.F.

(Tokyo). 1991; 110: 956-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The localization of CE in the endosomal system has been also demonstrated in antigen-presenting B cells lymphoblasts (7Bennett K. Levine T. Ellis J.S. Peanasky R.J. Samloff I.M. Kay J. Chain B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus it is conceivable that the mature form of CE is closely associated with endosomal localization of this enzyme because the proform of CE appears to be converted into mature form only after entering in intracellular acidic compartments. Microglia are known to interact with invaded CD4+ T helper (Th) cells in the central nervous system (8Hickey W.F. Kimura H.

The possible involvement of pepstatin A-sensitive aspartic proteases in the processing of antigenic peptide of native OVA was further substantiated by the present observations that digested fragments of native OVA by CE or CD could be recognized by OVA-specific Th cell hybridomas. In the present study, we could obtain no evidence indicating the involvement of aspartic proteases in the processing of Ii chain. However, there are several discrepant reports showing that aspartic protease inhibitors effectively prevented the processing of Ii chain (24Maric M.A. Taylor M.D. Blum J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 25Zhang T. Maekawa Y. Yasumoto K. Ishikawa H. Fawzy N.B. Dainichi T. Hisaeda H. Sakai T. Kasai M. Mizouchi T. Asano T. Katunuma N. Himeno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One reason for this discrepancy may be that aspartic proteases are involved in antigen presentation by microglia in a different way from that by peripheral APCs such as B cells. Additional experiments are necessary to elucidate this deduction.Our observations here further showed that microglia isolated from CD−/− mice retained an ability for antigen presentation. This is consistent with recent studies utilizing peripheral APCs prepared from CD−/− mice indicating that CD is not involved in degradation of Ii chain or generation of antigenic peptides (17Villadangos J.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The present finding that pepstatin A inhibited the antigen presentation of OVA by microglia suggest that CE is essentially involved in processing of OVA because CD and CE are only known for pepstatin A-sensitive endosomal/lysosomal aspartic proteases in mammalian cells. Recent evidence has also shown that CE is closely linked with the proteolytic processing of tetanus toxin (45Hewitt E.W. Treumann A. Morrice N. Tatnell P.J. Kay J. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4693-4699PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that agrees with a role for CE in antigen processing. CE is expressed in APCs such as Langerhans cells and B cells (26Sealy L. Mota F. Rayment N. Tatnell P. Kay J. Chain B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1838-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 46Solcia E. Paulli M. Silini E. Fiocca R. Finzi G. Kindl S. Boveri E. Bosi F. Cornaggia M. Capella C. Samloff I.M. Eur. J. Histochem. 1993; 37: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that CE is responsible for the processing of OVA in A20 cells (7Bennett K. Levine T. Ellis J.S. Peanasky R.J. Samloff I.M. Kay J. Chain B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although CE in B cells is found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and endosome-like compartment (26Sealy L. Mota F. Rayment N. Tatnell P. Kay J. Chain B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1838-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the distinct subcellular localization and molecular form is unclear. We have previously reported that CE was found to be localized in the early endosome as well as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi of primary cultured rat microglia (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely to consider that the expression of CE in activated microglia is mainly associated with processing of endocytic antigen into the endosomal compartments. The requirement of CE for the processing of exogenous antigens in microglia is to be further elucidated in future studies utilizing CE−/− mice that have been under generation.Although cysteine proteases are considered to be critical for the terminal step of Ii breakdown, their exact role varies among different APCs (14Villadangos J.A.

In B cells and dendritic cells, CS exclusively mediates the degradation of Ii to CLIP. For this purpose, thymic cortical cells and macrophages use CL and cathepsin F, respectively. Microglia have been suggested to use CS or CL for the degradation of Ii to CLIP, because microglia express CS and CL, but not cathepsin F (47Gresser O. Weber E. Hellwing A. Riese S. Régnier-Vigouroux A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1813-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,48Santambrogio L. Belyanskaya S.L. Fischer F.R. Cipriani B. Brosnan C.F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Stern L.J. Strominger J.L. Riese R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To address this suggestion, we conducted experiments utilizing specific inhibitors for cysteine proteases and found that the degradation of Ii to CLIP in microglia was mediated by both CS and CB but not CL. Similar results were also obtained when peripheral macrophages were used as APCs. Although there is increasing evidence that microglia is distinct from peripheral macrophages in various aspects, microglia were found to closely resemble peripheral macrophages as APCs. Our observations here show that CE exists in murine microglia/macrophages as the mature enzyme, whereas this enzyme exists in other peripheral APCs such as splenocytes and BMCs as enzymatically inactive proform. The difference in molecular form of CE among APCs is considered to reflect the difference in its intracellular localization, because CE was found to be converted into the mature form in an autocatalytic manner only after entering acidic compartments such as endosomes (4Sastradipura D.F. Nakanishi H. Tsukuba T. Nishishita K. Sakai H. Kato Y. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Yamamoto K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2045-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression level of CE mRNA in microglia was found to be markedly increased upon stimulation with IFN-γ which is well known to induce MHC class II expression as well as co-stimulatory molecule which are required for Th cell activation (43De Simone R. Giampaolo A. Giometto B. Gallo P. Levi G. Peschle C. Aloisi F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 54: 175-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 44Aloisi F. Ria F. Penna G. Adorini L. J.

A number of diacylglycerol kinases encoded by separate genes are present in mammalian genomes. We have cloned cDNAs encoding several isoforms of the human homologue of the rat diacylglycerol kinase β gene and characterized two such isoforms that differ at their carboxyl terminus through alternative splicing and the usage of different polyadenylation signals. Quantitative analysis of gene expression in a panel of human tissue cDNAs revealed that transcripts corresponding to both isoforms are co-expressed in central nervous system tissues and in the uterus, with one variant being expressed at relatively higher levels. As green fluorescent protein fusions, the two isoforms displayed localization to different subcellular compartments, with one variant being associated with the plasma membrane, while the other isoform was predominantly localized within the cytoplasm. Differences were also observed in their subcellular localization in response to phorbol ester stimulation. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that the two isoforms display comparable diacylglycerol kinase activities. Therefore, the human diacylglycerol kinase β gene can generate several enzyme isoforms, which can display different expression levels and subcellular localization but similar enzymatic activities in vitro.

It is synthesized by phospholipase C-β from phosphoinositides as a response to a variety of molecules involved in intercellular communication, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors. The best known target of DG action is protein kinase C (PKC), whose activity plays a central role in the control of proliferation and differentiation of many different cell types (1Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). In addition, DG can also modulate the activity of intracellular proteins such as members of the Rho and Ras families, thus potentially affecting other cellular functions such as cytoskeletal organization (2Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The control of steady-state cellular levels of DG is therefore crucial to normal cellular physiology. The signaling properties of DG are terminated by its conversion to phosphatidic acid (itself a second messenger, reviewed in Ref. 3Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, through the action of diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs), a class of evolutionary conserved enzymes presently counting nine mammalian subtypes encoded by separate genes (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι; reviewed in Ref. 4van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The cloning of DGK genes from several mammalian species (5–19) has allowed an analysis of the domain architecture of these proteins. Structurally, mammalian DGK subtypes are characterized by the presence of conserved domains, common to all subtypes and of additional subtype-specific functional domains, which allow their grouping into five separate classes (3Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The functional domains shared by all DGK subtypes comprise the catalytic (kinase) domain and a cysteine-rich domain with homology to the C1A and C1B motifs of PKC. By analogy with the C1A and C1B motifs in PKC, the cysteine-rich domains of DGK have been proposed to bind DG and present it to the catalytic domain (4van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Ahmed S. Kozma R. Lee J. Monfries C. Harden N. Lim L. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, a functional analysis of DGKα, DGKβ, and DGKγ demonstrated that the catalytic domain in these proteins lies in the COOH-terminal region, outside the zinc finger domain (21Sakane F. Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The subtype-specific functional domains (present in different DGK classes) include motifs of known function (e.g. calcium binding motifs, pleckstrin homology domains, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation site domains) as well as domains showing significant sequence conservation but whose function remains unknown (e.g. the C1 domain of Class I DGKs) (4van Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Very recently, plant DGK isoforms generated from the same gene through alternative splicing have been characterized which differ at their COOH terminus for the presence of a calmodulin-binding domain (22Snedden W.A. Blumwald E. Plant J. 2000; 24: 317-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the presence of calmodulin-binding domains in mammalian DGK enzymes has not been described to date. The precise function of the subtype-specific protein motifs is, in many instances, still unclear. However, the diversity and complexity of DGK enzymes indicates the potential for regulation of DGK activity at several levels, including subcellular localization (e.g. see Refs. 12Goto K. Kondo H.

Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), implicating functional diversification of DGK enzymes in this organ. Recently, a detailed analysis has been carried out of DGK expression in rat brain, with special reference to DGKα, DGKβ, and DGKγ (28Goto K. Kondo H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), showing localized expression in distinct brain regions for these DGK subtypes. DGKβ is a member of class I DGKs. Like the other members of this subgroup (the DGKα and DGKγ subtypes), it is characterized by the presence of a calcium binding (EF-hand) motif and an additional 70-amino acid domain of uncharacterized function, in addition to the kinase domain and the cysteine-rich domain motifs shared with all DGKs. To date, the only mammalian DGKβ gene for which a full-length cDNA is available has been cloned from the rat (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In that study, expression of rat DGKβ was found to be predominant in the adult brain, with lower expression levels in spleen, adrenal, small intestine, and heart. In the rat brain, DGKβ expression localizes to the caudate putamen, the nucleus accumbens, the olfactory bulb and tubercle, and the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer (28Goto K. Kondo H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of DGKβ and its expression pattern make it an important modulator of PKC activation in response to signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptors, in brain regions representing important glutamatergic, dopaminergic, acetylcholinergic, and serotonergic terminal fields (29Bonhomme N. Esposito E. J. Clin. Psychopharmacol. 1998; 18: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Given the important role proposed for PKC in the control of mood, learning, and memory (e.g. see Ref. 30Nogues X. Prog. Neuropsychopharmacol. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 21: 507-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), modulation of the DG pool in these brain areas by DGKβ may be relevant to cognitive and emotional aspects of central nervous system function. We have previously reported the identification and characterization of the human DGKβ locus using bioinformatics tools and presented RT-PCR evidence supporting the expression of mRNAs from this locus and the existence of alternative splicing events capable of generating a number of isoforms (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar). In particular, one of the transcripts arising from the human DGKβ locus corresponds to an EST annotated in GenBankTM as differentially expressed in bipolar disorder patients (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar), which can encode a DGKβ protein displaying a COOH-terminal truncation downstream of the catalytic domain. This EST potentially implicates the control of DGKβ splicing in mood disorders, although nothing is known of the properties of the encoded protein variant and of the relative abundance of its transcripts. Here we report the cloning of cDNAs encoding multiple DGKβ isoforms from human brain, confirming that alternative splicing of the DGKβ locus yields a number of transcripts encoding different DGKβ isoforms. We have then focused our analysis on the alternative splicing event potentially associated with mood disorders, which can generate DGKβ isoforms differing at their COOH terminus, and show that the encoded proteins display comparable enzymatic activities but different expression levels, responses to increased substrate availability and subcellular localization. The potential implications of these findings for DG signaling in the context of normal and aberrant neuronal physiology are discussed. PCR amplification was carried out employing the GeneAmp XL PCR kit (PE Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ), using human adult and fetal brain cDNA (see below) as a template. Reaction conditions (for primers, dNTP, and enzyme) were according to manufacturer's protocol, with a final Mg(OAc)2 concentration of 0.8 mm. Primer sequences were as follows: primer 5HDAGKFOR (5′-primer), 5′-ATGACAAACCAGGAAAAATGG-3′; DAGKF2REV (3′-primer for STD isoform), 5′-AGGATTATTCCTTGCTTCGG-3′; DAGK7REV (3′-primer for SV3′ isoform), 5′-AGCTAAATCATTGCCAAGGG-3′. Reaction details were as follows: 94 °C/3 min; 45×(94 °C/30 s; 55 °C/30 s; 72 °C/5 min); 72 °C/20 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel poured and run in 1 × TAE (Tris acetate-EDTA) buffer (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.6-6.13Google Scholar). The product was purified on a Qiaex PCR chromatography column (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA was extracted from several clones using Quiaex Miniprep columns (Qiagen) and subjected to automated DNA sequencing by standard protocols using an ABI377 machine (PE Biosystems). Total RNA was extracted from rat tissues as described (33Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Neuro2-A, PC12, and NB-OK-1 cells were cultured as described previously (34Caricasole A. Sala C. Roncarati R. Formenti E. Terstappen G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated RNA was extracted from subconfluent monolayers employing a modified oligo(dT)-cellulose binding protocol (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar), and 3 μg of each sample were loaded on denaturing gels and subjected to Northern blot analysis according to standard procedures (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar). Blots were exposed on Kodak XAR-5 films at −80 °C with intensifying screens for 10 days. Human polyadenylated RNA from various human tissues was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Real time quantitative PCR analysis of DGKβ isoform and β-actin expression was carried out with the aid of an ABI7700 machine (PE Biosystems). A 2× stock mixture of reagents comprising all necessary TaqMan PCR components except primers and probe was purchased from PE Biosystems and employed according to manufacturer's instructions. TaqMan primers specific for each human DGKβ isoform were as follows: DGKβ STD 5′primer, 5′-CACAAGAACCAAGCCCCAA-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GAGGGAGCAGAATAAACCGGT-3′. The TaqMan DGKβ STD probe was 5′-CTGATGGGCCCGCCTCCAAA-3′ and was carboxyfluorescein-labeled at its 5′ end. TaqMan DGKβ SV3′ primers were as follows: 5′-primer, 5′-TGCATTTCAAAAACATGCTAGGA-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-TGAAGGAAATTACACTGTTGGTCTTG-3′. The TaqMan DGKβ SV3′ probe was 5′-TGCTTTTGGCACTGGGAGTAGACACATGA-3′ and was carboxyfluorescein-labeled at its 5′ end. For TaqMan analysis of rat DGKβ expression, the primers were ratDGKβFOR 5′-GGATGCAGACCCCATGCA-3′ (forward) and ratDGKβREV 5′-AGGTGGAGGTCCCATCAGC-3′ (reverse), in combination with the carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe ratDGKβPROBE 5′-AAAAATTACACACAAGAACCAGGCCCCAA-3′. Final primers and probe concentrations were 300 nm each primer and 200 nm, respectively. Reaction parameters were 50 °C/2 min; 95 °C/10 min; 35×(95 °C/15 s; 53 °C/1 min). Three measurements per sample were carried out in each of two independent experiments. Results were analyzed with the ABI sequence detector software version 1.6.3 (PE Biosystems). Quantitation was carried out relative to a standard curve of the corresponding DGKβ cDNA. For β-actin quantitation, a β-actin detection kit was purchased (PE Biosystems) and employed according to manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs for hDGKβ STD and hDGKβ SV3′ (GenBankTM accession numbers AX032742 andAX032745, respectively) were subcloned into expression vector, pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO. The resulting constructs were used as templates for an in vitro transcription reaction coupled to translation reaction (TNT kit, Promega, Madison, WI). Control reactions contained no template or a luciferase containing plasmid vector as template. 7.5% SDS-PAGE coupled to Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody as a probe was used to identify the protein produced in TNT reactions. The cDNAs for hDGKβ STD and hDGKβ SV3′ in pcDNA3.1/V5/His-TOPO or the vector alone were transfected into COS cells by use of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 3 days the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out with anti-epitope tag antibody (anti-V5 antibody). The amounts of the expressed proteins (hDGKβ STD and hDGKβ SV3′) were equalized by means of densitometric indication of the corresponding bands, and the protein concentrations were also adjusted. Equal amount of each lysate was used to measure DG kinase activity in the presence of calcium (0.1 mm) by the octylglucoside mixed-micelle assay toward 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol (18:0/18:2 DG (Sigma)) as described previously (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mammalian expression vectors encoding human DGKβ variants were constructed in pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). Full-length DGKβ STD and DGKβ SV3′ were fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence attached at their NH2termini using a combination of cDNA fragments and engineered PCR fragments that ensured reading frame conservation. All PCR-based constructs were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing with dye terminators using an ABI PRISM 6700 Automated nucleic acid work station (PE Biosystems). GFP-tagged cDNA were transfected into HEK-293T cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's F-12 medium containing heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and transfected cells were plated onto poly-d-lysin-coated glass slides (Lab-Tek Flaskette Glass Slide, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Living cells transfected with GFP constructs were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axioplan 2, LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) at 24 or 48 h after transfection. In translocation experiments, the culture medium was replaced after transfection with medium without fetal bovine serum for 1 day before tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) addition. TPA was purchased from Sigma. We have previously reported (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar) the identification of the human DGKβ locus, characterized its genomic structure, and determined through bioinformatics and RT-PCR approaches that the locus is transcribed as a complex series of mRNAs due to alternative splicing and the use of different polyadenylation signals. This analysis predicted the existence of three alternatively spliced exons internal to the coding sequence and of a polyadenylation signal in the intron immediately downstream of the penultimate coding exon of the gene. A series of RT-PCR studies, which employed primers spanning each of the three putative alternatively spliced exons or were specific for the alternative 3′ regions of DGKβ, confirmed the existence of these alternative splicing events (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar). These studies were carried out on different preparations of human tissue cDNA, prepared from independent batches of commercially obtained mRNA. In particular, the existence of an alternatively spliced 3′ exon can result in the generation of transcripts predicted to encode two human DGKβ variants. One of such variants is fully homologous to the predicted rat DGKβ amino acid sequence (and is thus referred to as “standard human DGKβ isoform,” or DGKβ STD), and the other represents a truncated variant lacking part of the coding sequence present within the last exon (and is thus referred to as “splice variant 3′ human DGKβ isoform,” or DGKβ SV3′). The existence of three internal alternatively spliced exons results in further complexity in the predicted coding capacity of the human DGKβ locus, potentially resulting in DGKβ STD or SV3′ proteins with alternative amino acid regions. To physically clone human DGKβ cDNAs, we elected to amplify by proofreading PCR the entire predicted coding sequences from cDNA derived from fetal and adult human brain, based on the nucleotide sequence of the human DGKβ genomic locus and the predicted rat and human DGKβ coding sequences (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar). To obtain cDNAs for the predicted variants, we employed a single forward primer anchored 5′ to the predicted DGKβ initiation codon and two alternative reverse primers anchored 3′ to the stop codons predicted for the STD and SV3′ DGKβ variants. The resulting PCR products were cloned and subjected to DNA sequencing. This analysis confirmed the cloning of three DGKβ STD cDNAs and five DGKβ SV3′ cDNAs. Collectively, these cDNA clones represented 8 of the 16 DGKβ isoforms potentially generated from the human DGKβ locus (Fig. 1) and confirmed the predicted cDNA structure and splicing events previously reported by us (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar). To further confirm the identification of the human homologue of the previously reported rat DGKβ, a Northern blot comprising a panel of polyadenylated RNAs from adult rat tissues comparable with the one reported in Ref. 8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar was probed with one of the obtained human DGKβ cDNA clones. The results (Fig.2 A) revealed a single transcript of ∼6.5 kb present exclusively in the brain. In their report, Goto and co-workers (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) observed DGKβ transcripts expression in the heart and adrenal; our inability to detect DGKβ expression in these rat tissues employing a human probe may be due to lower sensitivity of our Northern blotting assay, differences in mRNA quality, or in the use of a probe from a different species (human versus rat). To address this discrepancy, we performed a quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) analysis on a panel of cDNAs prepared from various rat tissues, using a set of primers and probe specific for the published rat DGKβ sequence (Fig.2 B). The results confirmed that, among the adult rat tissues sampled in our experiments, the brain appears to be the only organ expressing DGKβ transcripts, in accordance with the Northern blotting data obtained using a human DGKβ probe (Fig. 1). The apparent size of the transcript and the predominance of expression in brain tissue are in accordance with the data reported for the rat DGKβ gene (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Figure 2Expression of DGK β transcripts in rat tissues. A, Northern blot of polyadenylated RNA (3 μg) from adult rat tissues and from rodent and human neuronal cell lines. The blot was probed with a full-length human DGKβ cDNA, revealing a single band of approximately 6.5 kb in the brain. The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed with a β-actin cDNA to control for RNA integrity.

Of particular interest are DGKβ variants displaying a deletion of the COOH-terminal 35 amino acids, comprising a region 3′ of the catalytic domain. In fact, deletion of this domain is associated with a human DGKβ EST (dbEST Id: 1371986 GenBankTM accession number AF019352) annotated as differentially expressed in mood disorder patients (3131. Caricasole, A., Caldara, F., and Sala, F. (2000) Patent WO 0047723.Google Scholar) and suggests that DGKβ variants bearing this truncation may be overrepresented in at least some cases of bipolar affective disorder. Given the importance of DG levels for PKC activity, the role of PKC in modulating aspects of cognitive and emotional behavior, and the expression of DGKβ in relevant areas of the rat central nervous system (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Goto K. Kondo H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell. Signal. 1996; 14: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Goto K. Kondo H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), further studies on DGKβ isoforms were focused on the comparative analysis of the expression, function, and subcellular localization of DGKβ proteins lacking the COOH-terminal coding exon. To determine the pattern of expression of DGKβ transcripts potentially encoding the DGKβ STD and DGKβ SV3′ isotypes, a series of quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) studies were carried out on a panel of cDNAs synthesized from human tissue samples, including several distinct brain regions (e.g. see Ref. 34Caricasole A. Sala C. Roncarati R. Formenti E. Terstappen G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Primers and probes were designed to recognize transcripts encoding either the DGKβ STD or the DGKβ SV3′ isoforms, independently of the presence or absence of the internal alternatively spliced exons. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that the human DGKβ locus is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system and uterus, with much lower levels of expression in other tissues. Increased DGKβ transcript levels in adult brain relatively to fetal brain indicate that DGKβ expression may be developmentally regulated. Within the adult brain, the amygdala, caudate nucleus, and hippocampus express the highest levels of DGKβ transcripts, in agreement with data previously reported for the rat DGKβ gene (8Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Goto K. Kondo H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell. Signal. 1996; 14: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 28Goto K. Kondo H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the tissue-specific profiles of expression for transcripts encoding the COOH terminus variants are essentially superimposable, important differences are observed in the relative levels of expression. In fact, transcripts encoding DGKβ STD proteins are expressed in the adult brain at levels about 10–100-fold higher than transcripts encoding DGKβ SV3′ isotypes (Fig. 3). An important observation is the expression of DGKβ transcripts in the uterus, suggesting a role for this enzyme in aspects of uterine function. The apparent discrepancy between the absolute and β-actin-normalized expression profiles of DGKβ SV3′ transcripts may be due to the low levels of expression of DGK SV3′ mRNAs in normal human tissue. The existence of transcripts capable of encoding DGKβ isotypes differing at their COOH terminus may indicate that the encoded proteins differ in their enzymatic activities. To address this aspect of DGKβ function, experiments were carried out in which the enzymatic activities of DG"

We have now used confocal microscopy, the patch clamp technique, and biotin labeling to further examine the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating ROMK1 trafficking. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cotransfected with c-Src and green fluorescent protein-ROMK1, which has the same biophysical properties as those of ROMK1. Patch clamp studies have shown that phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of PTP, decreased the activity of ROMK1. Moreover, addition of PAO reduced the cell surface localization of green fluorescent protein-ROMK1 detected by confocal microscopy and diminished the surface ROMK1 density by 65% measured by biotin labeling. Also, PAO treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of ROMK1. The notion that the effect of PAO is mediated by stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation-induced endocytosis of ROMK1 has also been supported by findings that mutating the tyrosine residue 337 of ROMK1 to alanine abolished the effect of PAO. Finally, the inhibitory effect of PAO on ROMK1 was completely blocked in the cells co-transfected with dominant negative dynamin (dynaminK44A). This indicates that the tyrosine phosphorylation-induced endocytosis of ROMK1 is dynamin-dependent. We conclude that inhibiting PTP increases ROMK1 phosphorylation and results in a dynamin-dependent internalization of the channel.

Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SK channels are the major contributors to the apical K+ conductance and are responsible for K+ secretion (4Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One important factor for regulating K+ secretion is the dietary K+ intake; a high K+ intake increases whereas a low K+ intake decreases K+ secretion (7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low K+ intake-induced decrease in K+ secretion is at least partially achieved by reducing the number of SK channels in the apical membrane of the CCD (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our preceding experiments strongly indicated that the low K+intake-induced decrease in SK channel number was mediated by protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK). This conclusion is supported by the observation that inhibition of PTK increased the number of the SK channels in the apical membrane of the CCD from rats on a K+-deficient diet (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of PTP decreased the number of SK channels in the CCD from rats on a high K+diet (9Wei Y. Bloom P. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because the effect of inhibiting PTP on channel activity was blocked by 20% sucrose, we speculated that inhibiting PTP increases the endocytosis of the SK channels whereas inhibiting PTK augments the exocytosis of the SK channels into the cell membrane. This notion is supported by observations that inhibiting PTP with PAO reduced whereas inhibiting PTK with herbimycin A increased the membrane location of ROMK1 in oocytes injected with GFP-ROMK1 and c-Src (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although our previous results strongly suggested that inhibiting PTP increases the endocytosis of ROMK1, additional experiments are required to prove the hypothesis, because ROMK1 trafficking may not be the same in oocytes as in mammalian cells. In addition, it is difficult to distinguish the ROMK1 channels located in the cell membrane from those in the submembrane of oocytes. In the present study we have provided additional evidence to support the hypothesis that inhibiting PTP increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 channels and stimulates the endocytosis of ROMK1. We used primers 5′ TGGGCCTAAAAGAATTCAGCTGCTGTGCAGACAAC (sense, nucleotides 81–115) and 5′ TTGTAGGTGGAAGGATCCCTGCTACATCTGGGTGTCG (antisense, nucleotides 1310–1346) for amplifying ROMK1 or mutant ROMK1, which was subcloned into pcDNA3.1. GFP-ROMK1 or GFP-R1Y337A was constructed by cloning the PCR products into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of plasmid-enhanced GFP-C1 expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The coding sequence of c-Src was cut from pGEM vector with HindIII andEcoRI and ligated into pCDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). All vector sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the William Keck Biotechnology Laboratory at Yale University. dynaminK44A was a gift from Dr. Michael Caplan at Yale University. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was carried out using 3 μl of LT1 reagent (PanVera, Madison, WI) per 35-mm cell culture dish according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of ROMK1+ 1 μg of c-Src, 1 μg of R1Y337A + 1 μg of c-Src, or 1 μg of ROMK1 + 1 μg of c-Src + 3 μg of dynaminK44A. The success rate of transient transfection was over 70%, and the experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. After identifying the cells for the study, we recorded cell images of middle sections under control conditions and after PAO treatment using a Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscope. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser beam and viewed with an inverted Olympus microscope equipped with a ×60 oil lens. The cell image taken under control conditions served as a control picture. All images were acquired, processed, and printed with identical parameters before and after PAO treatment. The change in cell surface ROMK1 upon treatment of the cells with PAO was quantitated by labeling the cells with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. HEK cells from each 35-mm dish were trypsinized with trypsin-EDTA (Fisher) and lysed with 200 μl of cold RIPA lysis buffer (1× PBS, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.1% SDS) containing 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) per ml of lysis buffer. The mixture was clarified at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was collected. GFP-ROMK1 fusion protein was immunoprecipitated by incubating the resultant supernatant with 1 μg of GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G (20 μl)-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the tube containing the mixture, and the tube was rotated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A/G-agarose immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min and washed twice with 1× PBS containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation, 1× SDS (50 μl) sample buffer (2% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 10% 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added to the resultant pellet followed by boiling the mixture for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The biotin-labeled GFP-ROMK1 proteins were detected by using NeutrAvidin (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) (Pierce). ROMK1 or ROMK1 mutant protein was detected by using a polyclonal ROMK1 antibody (1:200; Alomone Laboratories, Ltd., Jerusalem, Israel) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:15,000; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using PY20, an antibody that reacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). We also studied the endocytosis of ROMK1 following the protocol described by Collazo et al. (10Collazo R. Fan L. Hu M.C. Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31601-31608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HEK cells were labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) followed by treatment of cells with 1 μm PAO for 15 min at 37 °C to stimulate endocytosis. The cells were washed two times with PBS, and the surface biotin was cleaved with the cell-impermeant reducing agent, TCEP (Tris [2-carboxyethyl] phosphine hydrochloride) (50 mm). The internalized proteins labeled by biotin were protected from TCEP cleavage. After washing two times with PBS, the cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysate was treated as detailed above. An Axon200A patch clamp amplifier was used to record channel current. The current was low pass-filtered at 1 KHz by an eight-pole Bessel filter (902LPF; Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and digitized by an Axon interface (Digitada1200). Data were acquired by an IBM-compatible Pentium computer (Gateway 2000) at a rate of 4 KHz and analyzed using the pClamp software system 6.04 (Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). Channel activity was defined as NPo that was calculated from data samples of 60-s duration in the steady state as shown in Equation 1, NPo=Σ(1t1+2t2+…iti)Equation 1 where ti is the fractional open time spent at each of the observed current levels. The bath solution for the patch clamp study was composed of the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). The pipette solution was composed of the following (in mm): 140 mm KCl, 1.8 MgCl2, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4). Phenylarsine oxide was purchased from Sigma and added directly to the bath to reach the final concentration. We present data as mean ± S.E. The student'st test was used to determine the significance. We first examined the properties of the GFP-ROMK fusion protein using Western blot and the patch clamp technique. Fig.1 is a typical Western blot showing that ROMK antibody detects a 71-kDa protein harvested from the immunoprecipitation of the lysate of cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 with GFP antibody. Moreover, we had previously carried out the patch clamp study in oocytes injected with cRNA encoding GFP-ROMK1 and detected an inward-rectifying K+ channel with an inward conductance of 40 picosiemens (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This finding is also confirmed in the present investigation in which we have detected an inward-rectifying K+ channel with an inward slope conductance of 40 picosiemens in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 (data not shown). The K+ channel has a high open probability and similar channel kinetics to that of ROMK1. After confirming that GFP-ROMK1 has the same biophysical properties as those of ROMK1, we examined the effect of PAO on the activity of ROMK1 in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 and c-Src. Fig.2 is a typical recording showing that addition of 1 μm PAO inhibits the activity of ROMK1 by 95 ± 9%, and NPo falls from 0.93 to 0.04 (n = 4). This observation is consistent with our previous finding that inhibiting PTP decreased the activity of the native ROMK1-like channels in the CCD (9Wei Y. Bloom P. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have demonstrated previously that the inhibitory effect of PAO was absent in the CCDs treated with hypertonic solution, indicating that the effect of PAO on channel activity was mediated by stimulation of endocytosis (9Wei Y. Bloom P. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further investigated using confocal microscopy. Fig. 3 depicts typical confocal images obtained from HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 + vector (A–D) or ROMK1 + c-Src (E–H). Application of PAO had no significant effect on the location of ROMK1 in the cells transfected with vector (Fig. 3, A–D). In contrast, addition of PAO altered the location of ROMK1 in the cells transfected with c-Src. From inspection of Fig. 3, E–H, it is apparent that the membrane location of ROMK1 diminished whereas the density of ROMK1 in the intracellular compartment increased significantly within 15 min following PAO treatment. This strongly indicates that inhibiting PTP stimulates the endocytosis of ROMK1 in cells transfected with c-Src and GFP-ROMK1.Figure 3A typical confocal image showing the effect of PAO on the ROMK1 location in HEK293 cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 alone (A–D) or with GFP-ROMK1 + c-Src (E–H).

The cell image before addition of PAO is demonstrated in Awhereas B, C, and D show the ROMK1 location following addition of 1 μm PAO at 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively.

The cells were treated with PAO or vehicle at 37 °C for 15 min followed by labeling the surface proteins with biotin at 4 °C. The ROMK1 channels were harvested by immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with GFP antibody and detected by the ROMK antibody whereas the biotin-labeled ROMK1 channels were identified with neutravidin (Fig.4A). Clearly, treatment of cells with 1 μm PAO significantly reduced the number of the biotin-labeled ROMK1. In 11 experiments, the density of biotin-labeled ROMK1 channels decreased by 65 ± 3% in the cells treated with PAO in comparison to those without PAO. This strongly indicates that inhibiting PTP facilitates the internalization of ROMK1. This hypothesis is also supported by experiments in which the effect of PAO on ROMK1 membrane location was studied using sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. After labeling the surface proteins with biotin, the cells were treated with PAO for 15 min at 37 °C to stimulate endocytosis and then incubated with TCEP, a reducing agent, to cleave the surface biotin (Fig.4B). Thus, only internalized ROMK1 channels were labeled with biotin whereas the ROMK1 channels located in the cell membrane did not bear biotin. From inspection of Fig. 4B, it is apparent that inhibiting PTP significantly increased the internalization of ROMK1 channels. The amount of biotin-labeled ROMK1 in the PAO-treated group was 75 ± 9% (n = 4) of the control (no TCEP and PAO treatment) whereas the amount of the biotin-labeled ROMK1 in the absence of PAO was only 20 ± 4% (n = 4) of the control value. Inhibiting PTP is expected to enhance the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1, which has been shown to be a substrate of c-Src. 2Lin, D. H., Sterling, H., Lerea, K. M., Welling, P., Jin, L., Giebisch, G., and Wang, W. H. (2001) J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 12, 28. Therefore, we examined the effect of PAO on the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 in cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1 and c-Src. After immunoprecipitation of ROMK1 with the GFP antibody, we detected the tyrosine phosphorylated ROMK1 with PY20, an antibody that reacts with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Fig. 5 is a typical recording from 10 such experiments in which the effect of inhibiting PTP on the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 was studied. Although the same amount of ROMK1 was present in the cells treated or not treated with PAO, inhibiting PTP significantly increased the fraction of the tyrosine-phosphorylated ROMK1 by 110 ± 8% in comparison to those without PAO treatment. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that PAO increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 and in turn stimulates the internalization of ROMK1. Our previous experiments indicated that the tyrosine residue 337 in the C terminus was critical for mediating c-Src-induced phosphorylation.2 Moreover, the observation that mutation of the tyrosine residue to alanine abolished the inhibitory effect of PAO on K+ current in oocytes injected with R1Y337A and c-Src suggested that tyrosine residue 337 is essential for initiating PAO-induced endocytosis (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To further test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of PAO on the membrane location of ROMK1 mutant, R1Y337A. Fig. 6 is a typical confocal image from eight such experiments showing the effect of PAO on the distribution of R1Y337A in HEK293 cells cotransfected with c-Src and R1Y337A. In contrast to ROMK1, addition of PAO did not change the pattern of R1Y337A distribution, and the intensity of membrane fluorescence was not significantly altered in the presence of PAO. The possibility that tyrosine residue 337 is essential for facilitating the endocytosis of ROMK1 is also supported by experiments in which the effect of PAO on the membrane density of ROMK1 or R1Y337A was studied using the biotin labeling technique (Fig. 7). The cells transfected with c-Src + ROMK1 or c-Src + R1Y337A were incubated in the presence or in the absence of PAO at 37 °C for 15 min followed by biotin labeling at 4 °C. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, inhibiting PTP significantly diminished the amount of ROMK1 located in the cell membrane as shown by the fact that the intensity of the biotin-labeled ROMK1 decreased by 65 ± 3% in comparison to those in the absence of PAO, although the same amount of ROMK1 was present in cells treated or not treated with PAO. In contrast, PAO did not significantly reduce the number of R1Y337A in the cell membrane (95 ± 9% of the control value) in comparison to those in the absence of PAO in cells transfected with c-Src and R1Y337A.Figure 7A Western blot shows the effect of PAO on the membrane fraction of ROMK1 or R1Y337A labeled by biotin. The cells transfected with ROMK1/R1Y337A + c-Src were treated with PAO for 15 min followed by biotin labeling at 4 °C. The ROMK1/R1Y337A proteins were harvested by immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell lysate with GFP antibody. The membrane fraction of the K+ channels was detected with neutravidin horseradish peroxidase (left panel), and the total ROMK1/R1Y337A proteins were identified with ROMK antibody (right panel). The data were normalized according to the total K+ channel protein level. IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After establishing that inhibiting PTP increases the endocytosis of ROMK1 and that tyrosine residue 337 plays a key role in mediating the effect of PAO, we expanded the study to determine whether the effect of inhibiting PTP requires the involvement of dynamin. We first cotransfected the HEK293 cells with dominant negative dynamin (dynaminK44A), c-Src, and ROMK1 and found that the cells expressing ROMK1 also successfully expressed c-Src and dynaminK44A (Fig.8). The effect of PAO on the ROMK1 distribution has also been studied using confocal microscopy and biotin labeling techniques. Fig. 9 is a typical confocal image demonstrating the effect of PAO on ROMK1 distribution in the cells transfected with GFP-ROMK1, c-Src, and dynaminK44A at a ratio of 1:1:3. It is apparent that PAO-induced internalization of ROMK1 is absent in the cells transfected with dynaminK44A (n = 7). The possibility that dynamin is required for the PAO-induced endocytosis of ROMK1 is also supported by the observation that PAO did not significantly decrease the number of ROMK1 in the membrane of cells transfected with dynaminK44A (Fig. 10). In 10 experiments we have observed that inhibiting PTP reduced the amount of the biotin-labeled ROMK1 by 10 ± 8% in comparison to those without PAO treatment in cells transfected with dynaminK44A. The difference is not significant. Therefore, this indicates that inhibiting PTP-induced endocytosis of ROMK1 requires the involvement of dynamin.Figure 9A confocal image showing the effect of PAO on the distribution of ROMK1 channels in HEK293 cells transfected with dynaminK44A, GFP-ROMK1, and c-Src.

We used PAO as a tool to study the effect of tyrosine phosphorylation on ROMK1. Although it is possible that PAO may have effects other than inhibiting PTP, three lines of evidence indicated that the effect of PAO on channel activity results from inhibiting PTP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. First, our present study shows that PAO treatment increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1. Second, mutation of tyrosine residue 337 of ROMK1 to alanine abolished the effect of PAO on ROMK1 channel distribution. This finding is consistent with our previous observation that PAO did not affect channel activity in oocytes injected with R1Y337A (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M.

Third, our previous investigation has shown that inhibiting PTK can also abolish the effect of PAO on the activity of ROMK1 (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H. Deng H. Ali S. Gu R.M. Huang X.Y. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7156-7163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ROMK1 is an inwardly rectifying K+ channel that is located in the apical membrane of the CCD (3Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C.

Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CCD is responsible for K+ secretion and the hormone-regulated sodium reabsorption (7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F821-F825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K+ secretion is a two-step process; K+ enters the cell via the basolateral Na+-K+-ATPase and then diffuses into the lumen across the apical K+ channels (7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of K+ channels, an SK channel and a Ca2+-activated large conductance K+ channel (13Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1989; 256: F143-F151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Satlin L.M.

Renal Physiol. 1987; 252: F458-F467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified in the apical membrane. The SK channel is mainly responsible for K+ secretion, because the SK channel has a high density and a high channel open probability (4Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although it is still not completely understood whether ROMK1 alone is sufficient to form the native SK channel, it is well established that ROMK1 is a key component of the native SK channel in the CCD (4Wang W.H. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, ROMK1 plays a key role in regulating K+ secretion in the kidney. K+ secretion is regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and by a dietary K+ intake (7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F821-F825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of aldosterone on K+ secretion may be mediated by increasing the driving force for K+ diffusion across the apical membrane rather than altering the K+ conductance (19Schafer J.A. Troutman S.L. Schlatter E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1990; 258: F199-F210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This view is supported by the observation that application of aldosterone alone did not increase the number of the functional SK channels in the CCD (20Palmer L.G. Antonian L. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 105: 693-710Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The effect of the dietary K+ intake on K+ secretion is well established; a low K+ intake decreases whereas a high K+ intake increases K+ secretion in the CCD (7Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F817-F833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 277: F821-F825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the dietary K+ intake on K+ secretion is at least in part achieved by changing the number of apical SK channels. For instance, we and others (14Wang W. Schwab A. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1990; 259: F494-F502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Palmer L.G. Antonian L. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 105: 693-710Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) have observed that the number of ROMK1 channels increased in the CCD harvested from rats on a high K+ diet. Moreover, the effect of a high K+ intake on ROMK1 channels was not mediated by increasing transcription or translation, because neither ROMK mRNA nor ROMK protein in the kidney harvested from rats on a high K+ diet was changed in comparison to those on a normal K+ diet (21Frindt G. Zhou H. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: F525-F531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that post-translation factors are involved in regulating the effect of the dietary K+ intake on K+ secretion. However, the nature of the factors responsible for mediating the effect of the K+ intake on ROMK1 is not completely understood. We have observed previously that a low K+ intake increases whereas a high K+ intake decreases the expression of c-Src and cYes PTK in the kidneys (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the role of PTK in mediating the effect of dietary K+ intake on K+ secretion. This notion is further supported by observations that inhibiting PTK increased the number of functional ROMK1 channels in the CCD obtained from rats on a K+-deficient diet (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang W.H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibiting PTP decreased the number of ROMK1 channels in the tubule from rats on a high K+ diet (9Wei Y. Bloom P. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20502-20507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, a low K+intake increases the PTK-sensitive recycling pool of ROMK1 channels (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of ROMK1 is an important mechanism by which a dietary K+ intake changes the ROMK1 density in the cell membrane. It is highly possible that an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 diminishes whereas a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 augments the number of the ROMK1 channels in the cell membrane. This hypothesis has been supported by the preceding findings that PAO inhibits whereas herbimycin A increases the K+ current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 and c-Src (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y.

Four lines of evidence obtained from the previous and the present investigations strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of PTK on ROMK1 channels is mediated by increasing the internalization of ROMK1 rather than by a direct inhibition induced by tyrosine phosphorylation. First, we have previously shown that addition of exogenous c-Src to the bath facing cytosolic membrane of inside-out patches did not block the channel activity (1Moral Z. Deng K. Wei Y. Sterling H.

Second, previous investigations have found that the inhibitory effect of PAO on K+ current in oocytes injected with ROMK1 and c-Src was abolished by hypertonic solution or concanavalin A (1Moral Z.

Third, we have previously used GFP-ROMK1 as a tool to demonstrate that PAO decreases whereas herbimycin A increases the fluorescence intensity of the membrane in oocytes injected with c-Src and GFP-ROMK1 (1Moral Z.

This observation has also been confirmed by the present finding that inhibiting PTP decreased the number of ROMK1 in the membrane of HEK cells using confocal microscopy and the biotin labeling technique. Finally, we have shown in the present study that the effect of PAO on the ROMK1 surface distribution was absent in the cells transfected with dominant negative dynamin. Dynamin has been shown to be involved in clathrin-mediated vesicular trafficking processes (25Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T.

In the kidney, dynamin is required for initiating endocytosis of epithelial sodium channels (29Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol.

It has been shown that dynamin is a substrate of PTK, and phosphorylation of dynamin is essential for inducing the internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor (30Foster-Barber A. Bishop M. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11312-11319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We need further experiments to determine whether dynamin phosphorylation is required for inducing the endocytosis of ROMK1. However, the observation that expression of dynaminK44A abolished the effect of PAO on the internalization of ROMK1 channels strongly indicates that endocytosis of ROMK1 requires dynamin. In the present study we have demonstrated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 is an important step for initiating the endocytosis of ROMK1, because mutation of tyrosine residue 337 of ROMK1 completely abolished the PAO-induced stimulation of ROMK1 endocytosis. We have previously demonstrated that ROMK1 is a substrate of c-Src, and tyrosine residue 337 is the main site of PTK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (11Gu R.M. Wei Y. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that phosphorylation of tyrosine residue is not the only requirement for initiating the endocytosis of ROMK1. This conclusion is based on our observation that PAO did not inhibit the activity of ROMK2 channels in oocytes. 3Unpublished observation. Moreover, inhibiting PTP did not inhibit the ROMK-like K+ channels in the thick ascending limb (11Gu R.M. Wei Y. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where ROMK2 is located. This indicates that the N terminus of ROMK1 may also be required for starting the endocytosis. We need further experiments to explore the role of the N terminus in inducing the endocytosis of ROMK1. The physiological significance of the present investigation is to define a mechanism by which a low K+ intake decreases the apical K+ conductance and K+ secretion. We have demonstrated previously that the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated ROMK channels was significantly larger in the kidney from rats on a K+-deficient diet than those on a high K+ diet (11Gu R.M. Wei Y. Falck J.R. Krishna U.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding may be used to explain the observation that the positive response of ROMK1-like K+ channels in the CCD to herbimycin A was over 80% in the CCD from rats on a K+-deficient diet. In contrast, the response of the K+ channel to PTK inhibitor was absent in the CCD from rats on a high K+ diet (8Wei Y. Bloom P. Lin D.H. Gu R.M. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F206-F212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.11 is a model of a CCD principal cell illustrating the mechanism by which low K+ intake decreases the apical SK channels. A low K+ intake increases the expression and activity of PTK and in turn enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1. As a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1, the K+ channel is internalized, and the apical K+conductance falls. We conclude that inhibiting PTP increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 and enhances the dynamin-dependent endocytosis and that tyrosine residue 337 of ROMK1 is essential for the effect of inhibiting PTP.

Myosin phosphatase activity is critical to the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization, cytokinesis, and cell motility. Here, we describe the association of Raf-1 with myosin phosphatase and phosphorylation of the regulatory myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase by Raf-1. Treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate has been shown to stimulate Raf-1 protein kinase. To determine the effect of enzymatic activation of Raf-1 on MBS phosphorylation, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length Raf-1. A significantly higher phosphorylation of purified glutathioneS-transferase-tagged truncated MBS protein (amino acids 654–880) occurred in the presence of FLAG-Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated cells compared with untreated cells (∼3.0-fold). Using a sequential kinase-phosphatase assay and phosphorylated myosin light chain as substrate in the phosphatase reaction, we showed that Raf-1-associated protein phosphatase-specific activity was inhibited (relative phosphatase activity without and with adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate): 100 and ∼30%, respectively). Previously, ionizing radiation has been shown to activate Raf-1 (Kasid, U., Suy, S., Dent, P., Ray, S., Whiteside, T. L., and Sturgill, T. W. (1996) Nature 382, 813–816). Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation resulted in the increased association of Raf-1 with MBS (3–6-fold versus unirradiated control) and inhibition of Raf-1-associated protein phosphatase-specific activity (relative phosphatase activity without and with ionizing radiation: 100 and ∼54%, respectively). Our studies identify MBS as a new substrate of Raf-1 and implicate a role for Raf-1 in the regulation of pathways involving myosin phosphatase activity.

Although MEK1 is the most widely recognized physiological substrate for Raf-1, growing evidence suggests a link between Raf-1 and a variety of other downstream effectors (7Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 289-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Recently, Raf-1 has been linked with cytoskeletal architecture via its association with vimentin and vimentin kinases (8Janosch P. Kieser A. Eulitz M. Lovric J. Sauer G. Reichert M. Gounari F. Buscher D. Baccarini M. Mischak H. Kolch W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2008-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data underscore the importance of as yet unknown effectors likely to be involved in the Raf-1-mediated biological response. Myosin phosphatase holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of an ∼130-kDa regulatory myosin-binding subunit (MBS)1; an ∼38-kDa catalytic protein phosphatase subunit, PP1cδ (PP1δ); and a 20-kDa protein of as yet unknown function, M20 (9Alessi D.

MBS binds to both PP1δ and phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLCP), targeting PP1δ to its substrate MLCP and resulting in MLC dephosphorylation.

In efforts to identify novel Raf-1-interacting proteins, we discovered that Raf-1 associates with MBS under a variety of in vitroand in vivo experimental conditions, including radiation treatment. Raf-1 was found to phosphorylate MBS, and this association led to a concomitant inhibition of Raf-1-interacting protein phosphatase activity. MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells (obtained from the Tissue Culture Resource of the Lombardi Cancer Center) were maintained and serum-starved overnight prior to irradiation as described (17Kasid U. Suy S. Dent P. Ray S. Whiteside T.L. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1996; 382: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Suy S. Anderson W.B. Dent P. Chang E. Kasid U. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells (obtained from the Tissue Culture Resource) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Plasmid DNA constructs for expression of GST fusion proteins of wild-type/full-length Raf-1 (GST-Raf-1) and its NH2-terminal domain (amino acids 1–323, GST-Raf-N) were generated, and GST-Raf-1 fusion protein was purified as described (19Grammatikakis N. Lin J.-H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The constructs for expression of FLAG-tagged wild-type (FLAG-Raf-1) and mutant (FLAG-Raf-1(K375M)) Raf-1 in COS-1 cells were generated as described (20Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A human MBS cDNA clone was isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library using reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into a mammalian expression vector (pRK7) downstream of a Myc tag sequence to express NH2-terminal Myc-tagged full-length MBS protein (Myc-MBS, ∼140 kDa). A cDNA fragment encoding a portion of the human MBS protein (ΔMBS, amino acids 654–880) was amplified using a pair of mismatch primers to introduce the flanking BamHI andEcoRI sites. The partial cDNA fragment was subcloned into the pGEX4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for expression of GST-ΔMBS fusion protein (∼55 kDa). The sequences of full-length MBS cDNA and its fragment were confirmed by the dideoxy sequencing method at the Biomolecular Core Facility of the University of Virginia. GST-ΔMBS fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) by incubation at 23 °C for 24 h using LB medium in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified by glutathione-agarose column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). MDA-MB 231 cells (2.5 × 108) were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described (17Kasid U. Suy S. Dent P. Ray S. Whiteside T.L. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1996; 382: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The supernatant was precleared for 1–2 h with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and incubated with monoclonal anti-Raf-1 antibody for 6 h at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was then added, and the immune complex was captured by overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at 4 °C. The beads were washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and samples were pooled and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained without fixation with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands (∼130 and ∼135 kDa) in various lanes were excised and electroeluted separately in an Amicon Centrilutor microelectroeluter (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3). The eluates were concentrated in a Centricon-30 concentrator (Millipore), pooled, and subjected to 6.0% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining as described above; the gel was partially destained; and two bands representing a doublet (∼130 and ∼135 kDa) were excised separately, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT) at the Yale University Microsequencing Facility. Mass spectra of peptides from p130 and p135 were compared with the protein and gene sequence data bases using the SEQUEST computer program (21Yates J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Anal.

Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5470) Google Scholar). MDA-MB 231 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 30 min in a cold room and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Two mg of protein was precleared over protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1–2 h; the beads were removed by centrifugation; and the supernatant was incubated with a desired antibody overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complex was captured by incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose for 1.5–3 h. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The immune complex was used in an immunoblot and/or in vitro kinase assay. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For each 100-mm culture dish, 10–15 μg of plasmid DNA was used. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (with 200 mm NaCl), and lysates were tested for expression of exogenous protein by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector containing Myc-MBS or the Myc tag control vector, followed by lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and preclearance as described above. Approximately 1.5 mg of protein was incubated with GST or GST-Raf-1 protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B for 3–4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS, and the bound proteins were released by treating the beads twice with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The pooled fractions were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer and boiled, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The binding of Myc-MBS to GST-Raf-1 was detected by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-Myc epitope antibody 9E10. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-MBS or the Myc tag control vector (Myc) and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa3VO4, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein (1.5 mg) was precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 1.5 h, and exogenous MBS was immunoprecipitated overnight with 3.5 μg of anti-Myc antibody 9E10. The immune complex was captured with protein A/G-agarose for 1.5 h, and immunoprecipitated Myc-MBS was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween for 3 h at 4 °C and incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (PBS/Tween, 1.5% nonfat dry milk, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmATP, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.5 mg/ml GST-Raf-1 fusion protein or GST (as a negative control). Bound GST-Raf-1 protein was observed by incubation of the membrane with 0.5 μg/ml anti-GST antibody for 1 h, followed by ECL detection. The membrane was reprobed with anti-Myc epitope antibody 9E10 to confirm the co-localization of Myc-MBS and GST-Raf-1. Purified GST-ΔMBS protein was used as substrate in in vitro kinase reactions performed using purified GST-Raf-1 fusion protein or immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged full-length Raf-1 as detailed below. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-Raf-1 or FLAG-Raf-1(K375M). Thirty-six h after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated for 20 min with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or vehicle (Me2SO). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (with 200 mm NaCl). Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant (∼1 mg of protein) was precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 2 h. Exogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). The immune complex was captured by protein A/G-agarose for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm okadaic acid, 15 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol)). An in vitro kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 60 min in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-ΔMBS. The reaction was terminated by adding 6× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 4 min. The samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was first stained with Ponceau S to visualize total GST-ΔMBS (∼55 kDa) and then exposed to x-ray film. After autoradiography, the membrane was immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 to visualize FLAG-Raf-1 (wild-type or K375M, ∼74 kDa). The autoradiographs were scanned using the ImageQuant software program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The arbitrary scanner values were plotted as -fold control (untransfected and untreated COS-1 cells). For stoichiometric analysis of GST-ΔMBS phosphorylation by Raf-1 kinase, FLAG-Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of COS-1 transfectants (500 μg of protein) after PMA treatment as described above. The in vitro kinase reactions were carried out in parallel for various time points in kinase buffer containing FLAG-Raf-1 immune complex, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼900 cpm/pmol), and 40 μg/ml GST-ΔMBS. The reactions were terminated by adding 6× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 4 min. The samples were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G-250 and dried, followed by autoradiography. The radioactive band (∼55 kDa) corresponding to the phosphorylated substrate was excised, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. In vitro phosphorylation of purified GST-ΔMBS protein in the presence of purified GST-Raf-1 was performed using the kinase reaction conditions described above. In vitrophosphorylation of purified GST-ΔMBS by catalytically active, recombinant Rho-associated kinase-α (ROKα; 66 kDa) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was performed exactly as described (15Muranyi A. Zhang R. Liu F. Hirano K. Ito M. Epstein H.F. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Purified GST-Raf-1 or endogenous Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB 231 cells was used to phosphorylate an MBS-specific peptide, P3, representing amino acids 683–701 of the MBS protein (NH2-KARSRQARQSRRSTQGVTL-COOH) (23Takahashi N. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Odai H. Takemura K. Genomics. 1997; 44: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). P3 containing a single amino acid mismatch, P3m (Thr696 to Val, NH2-KARSRQARQSRRSVQGVTL-COOH), and two other MBS peptides, P1 (NH2-VTTPTVSSGQATPTSPIK-COOH, amino acids 395–412) and P2 (NH2-ISPKEEERKDESPATWRLGLRK-COOH, amino acids 421–442) (23Takahashi N. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Odai H. Takemura K. Genomics. 1997; 44: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were also designed and tested. GST-Raf-N containing only the NH2 terminus of Raf-1 was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitated Raf-1 (∼750 μg of total protein) or GST-Raf-1-Sepharose (20 ng) was incubated with the peptide (150 μm) for 15–20 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of the kinase reaction mixture, and peptide-associated radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation. Unless otherwise indicated, data were plotted using the radioactivity values obtained with P1 as a base-line control. Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB 231 cell lysates (2 mg of protein) prepared in Nonidet p-40 lysis buffer without the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of the kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 12 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 or 100 μmnonradioactive ATPγS (Sigma). The control reaction did not contain ATPγS. In addition, a kinase reaction was also performed in the presence of an ROKα inhibitor, HA-1077 (Calbiochem) or Y-27632 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, followed by microcentrifugation. Phosphatase activity was assayed using the serine/threonine protein phosphatase assay system and phosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBPP;33P-labeled MBP) according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs Inc.). Phosphatase activity in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates was also assayed using MLCP (4 μm, 32P-labeled MLC) as substrate. The phosphatase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 5 min (MLCP) or 10 min (MBPP). The radioactivity released in the supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The reaction was performed in duplicate per data point per experiment. Proteins in the pellet (Raf-1 immune complex, 1.0–1.5 mg of protein) were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by sequential immunoblotting of the same blot with anti-MBS, anti-PP1δ, and anti-Raf-1 antibodies and ECL to detect MBS, PP1δ, and Raf-1 protein expression, respectively. The ECL signals were computer-scanned using ImageQuant software. The relative amounts of Raf-1-associated PP1δ protein in various samples were determined by dividing the PP1δ arbitrary scanner value by the Raf-1 value for that lane. Phosphatase-specific activity was then calculated using the following formula: absolute radioactivity (cpm)/relative amount of Raf-1-associated PP1δ protein. The phosphatase-specific activity data were plotted as -fold base-line control reaction, i.e.without ATPγS. To identify new substrates of Raf-1 protein kinase, the whole cell lysates of MDA-MB 231 human breast carcinoma cells were examined for proteins associated with Raf-1. Two proteins (∼130 and ∼135 kDa) co-immunoprecipitated with Raf-1 and were readily visible on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. These proteins were purified by sequential fractionation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Four peptides from the 130-kDa band (peptides 1–4) and two peptides from the 135-kDa band (peptides 5 and 6) matched with MBS of human myosin phosphatase (Table I). In addition, three mass spectra from the 130-kDa band matched with myosin phosphatase protein from rat and chicken (data not shown).Table IPeptides obtained from mass spectrometric analysis of ∼130- and ∼135-kDa proteins co-immunoprecipitating with Raf-1 and identification of human MBSPeptide No.Average mass (Da)Peptide sequenceAmino acid position in MBS11568.81WIGSETDLEPPVVK17–3021875.86SPLIESTANMDNNQSQK299–31531367.69TGSYGALAEITASK443–45641099.64LAYVAPTIPR494–50351618.80STQGVTLTDLQEAEK695–70961189.53SGSYSYLEER908–917Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates of logarithmically growing MDA-MB 231 cells using monoclonal anti-Raf-1 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

The Coomassie Blue-stained ∼130- and ∼135-kDa bands were excised and individually digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using SEQUEST molecular recognition system software. To confirm the in vivo association of Raf-1 and MBS, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments were performed. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Raf-1 and MBS was observed in MDA-MB 231 cells (Fig. 1, Aand B). To determine whether exogenous MBS interacts with Raf-1, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector containing Myc-tagged full-length MBS. The expression of Myc-MBS (∼140 kDa) in COS-1 transfectants was verified by immunoblotting with anti-Myc epitope antibody (Fig. 1C). The interaction of Myc-MBS with GST-Raf-1 fusion protein (∼100 kDa) (8Janosch P. Kieser A. Eulitz M. Lovric J. Sauer G. Reichert M. Gounari F. Buscher D. Baccarini M. Mischak H. Kolch W.

These data established a direct association between Raf-1 and MBS in MDA-MB 231 and COS-1 cells. To address that the physical association of Raf-1 and MBS means that Raf-1 phosphorylates MBS, in vitro kinase assays were performed using purified GST-tagged truncated MBS protein (amino acids 654–880, GST-ΔMBS, ∼55 kDa) as a substrate of Raf-1. This fragment of MBS includes an inhibitory phosphorylation site (Thr696) (27Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In a direct in vitro kinase assay, followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, GST-Raf-1 protein kinase was observed to phosphorylate GST-ΔMBS (Fig. 2, left panels). As a positive control, the catalytic domain of purified ROKα protein (66 kDa) was shown to phosphorylate GST-ΔMBS (Fig. 2,right panels). Treatment of cells with the protein kinase C activator PMA has been shown to decrease Raf-1 mobility and to enhance Raf-1-associated serine/threonine kinase activity (24Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8855-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We investigated whether PMA-activated Raf-1 is more efficient in phosphorylating GST-ΔMBS protein. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector containing FLAG-tagged wild-type Raf-1 or FLAG-tagged Raf-1(K375M). Following PMA treatment, exogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immune complex was used in an in vitro kinase assay. Representative data demonstrate that a significantly higher phosphorylation of GST-ΔMBS occurred with PMA-stimulated FLAG-Raf-1 compared with the unstimulated counterpart (∼3.0-fold) (Fig.3B, WT/PMA versus WT). The final stoichiometry of phosphorylation of GST-ΔMBS using the FLAG-Raf-1 immune complex as a source of Raf-1 protein kinase was ∼0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of substrate (Fig.3C). The reason for the slight activity seen in the presence of FLAG-Raf-1(K375M) immunoprecipitates is unclear and may represent some background activity. However, PMA treatment had a negligible effect on mutant Raf-1 kinase activity (Fig. 3B, K375M versus K375M/PMA). In addition, as would be expected, phosphorylation of GST-ΔMBS by wild-type Raf-1 was found to be significantly higher compared with mutant Raf-1 (3.96-fold) (Fig.3B, WT/PMA versus K375M/PMA). Similar observations were made when we used His6-MEK1 protein (4.44-fold), a known physiological substrate of Raf-1 (data not shown). We next designed three MBS-specific peptides (23Takahashi N. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Kaibuchi K. Odai H. Takemura K. Genomics. 1997; 44: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) designated as P1 (amino acids 395–412), P2 (amino acids 421–442), and P3 (amino acids 683–701) and tested whether these are the novel peptides phosphorylated by Raf-1. GST-Raf-1 specifically phosphorylated P3, but not P2 or P1 (P3 versus P1 or P2, ∼8-fold) (Fig.4A). Furthermore, P3 containing a single amino acid mismatch (P3m, Thr696 to Val) exhibited significantly diminished phosphorylation compared with P3 (∼4-fold), and GST-Raf-N fusion protein (containing only the amino terminus of Raf-1) was far less effective in phosphorylating P3 compared with GST-Raf-1 (∼4.0-fold) (Fig. 4A). ROKα has been shown to cause phosphorylation of MBS (13Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). HA-1077 (100 μm), a chemical compound previously shown to inhibit ROKα activity (25Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar), did not inhibit Raf-1 kinase activity and Raf-1-mediated phosphorylation of P3 (data not shown). Cellular Raf-1 also phosphorylated MBS peptide P3 compared with control MBS peptide P1 (∼6.0-fold), and phosphorylation of a single amino acid mutant peptide (P3m) was relatively less (∼2.0-fold) (Fig. 4B). The presence of HA-1077 in the reaction mixture did not affect the level of P3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Cellular ROKα was also found to phosphorylate P3, and HA-1077 inhibited this mode of P3 phosphorylation (data not shown). From these observations, it appears that Thr696 of MBS is an important phosphorylation site for Raf-1 protein kinase, although the presence of additional site(s) in the P3 peptide cannot be ruled out. Phosphorylation of Ser430 of chick MBS (which corresponds to Thr435 of human MBS) (26Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hosoya H. Hartshorne D.J. Matsamura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) during mitosis has been associated with activation of myosin phosphatase, and the P2 peptide contains Thr435. To further confirm Raf-1 selectivity for the P3 site, the phosphorylation of MBS peptides P3 and P2 was compared using Raf-1 immunoprecipitated from nocodazole-arrested MDA-MB 231 cells enriched in the mitotic phase (G2/M > 93%). Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4A, Raf-1 phosphorylated P3, but not P2 (Fig. 4C). We used a sequential kinase-phosphatase assay to unequivocally demonstrate the inhibition of Raf-1-associated myosin phosphatase activity. We used nonradioactive ATPγS in the kinase reaction and MBPP or MLCP as substrate in the phosphatase reaction. Thio-phosphorylation of cellular MBS (co-immunoprecipitated with Raf-1) was performed because it is resistant to phosphatase activity of the myosin phosphatase holoenzyme (27Ichikawa K. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4733-4740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATPγS (100 μm), endogenous protein phosphatase activity associated with Raf-1 immune complexes decreased by ∼55 and ∼70% with MBPP and MLCP as substrates, respectively (Fig.5, A and B). Similar results were obtained when the ATPγS concentration was reduced to 20 μm (data not shown). The presence of ROKα inhibitors HA-1077 (100 μm) and Y-27632 (20 μm) (26Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hosoya H. Hartshorne D.J. Matsamura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) did not prevent reduction of phosphatase activity, establishing that the observed phosphorylation of MBS and inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity are not due to ROKα. Previously, we demonstrated that exposure of human tumor cells (PCI-04A and MDA-MB 231) to ionizing radiation (IR) results in tyrosine phosphorylation, membrane translocation, and activation of Raf-1 (17Kasid U. Suy S. Dent P. Ray S. Whiteside T.L. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1996; 382: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Suy S. Anderson W.B. Dent P. Chang E. Kasid U. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether myosin phosphatase is a target of Raf-1 protein kinase in irradiated cells, we first examined the effect of IR on the association of MBS and PP1 with cellular Raf-1. IR treatment of MDA-MB 231 cells caused a significant increase in the association of Raf-1 with MBS (∼3–6-fold) and PP1 (∼3-fold) (Fig.6, A–C). No change in the total amount of Raf-1, MBS, or PP1 protein per se was detected after irradiation (data not shown). These results suggest that activated Raf-1 selectively associates with myosin phosphatase. We next measured protein phosphatase-specific activity in Raf-1 immune complexes from irradiated cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, protein phosphatase-specific activity in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates from irradiated cells was inhibited compared with unirradiated MDA-MB 231 cells (−IR, 100%; +IR, ∼54%). Additional metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that irradiation of MDA-MB 231 cells also led to a modest increase (∼50%) in the total pool of phosphorylated MBS (data not shown). Consistent with the effects of okadaic acid on PP1 phosphatases (28Brautigan D.L. Shriner C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 29Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), phosphatase activity present in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates was not affected by 2 nmokadaic acid, but was inhibited by 2 μm okadaic acid (5 min at 30 °C) (data not shown). These data indicate a functional association of Raf-1 with PP1 protein phosphatase. Very limited information is available on the role of Raf-1 protein kinase in cytoskeletal reorganization. This study provides a direct link between Raf-1 and myosin phosphatase, an important component of pathways regulating cytoskeletal reorganization, cytokinesis, and cell motility. Rho kinase, a ZIP-like kinase, and myotonic dystrophy protein kinase have been shown to phosphorylate MBS at Thr696, resulting in the inhibition of myosin phosphatase (14MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Muranyi A. Zhang R. Liu F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Our findings concur with these observations in the sense that Raf-1 protein kinase targets Thr696 in MBS; we cannot, however, rule out the presence of other sites in MBS preferentially phosphorylated by Raf-1. Previously, MBS-specific peptide P2 has been shown to be phosphorylated (MBS Ser430) by a mitotic kinase, resulting in the activation of myosin phosphatase activity (26Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hosoya H. Hartshorne D.J. Matsamura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our present observations that the P2 peptide is not phosphorylated by Raf-1 emphasize the importance of Raf-1-specific inhibition of myosin phosphatase. In addition, Raf-1 does not phosphorylate another MBS-specific peptide, P1. Whether regulation of myosin phosphatase by Raf-1 can lead to a biological response distinct from other known and unknown MBS kinases remains to be seen. Our data appear to support the general notion that, depending on the cell type and stimulation, physiological compensatory mechanisms including regulation of myosin phosphatase activity are governed by overlapping and complementary pathways. Dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is an integral aspect of cellular responses to environmental signals. The small GTPase Rac is required for the formation of lamellipodia at the front of migrating cells, whereas at the rear of the cell, phosphorylation of MLC produces actomyosin contractility and de-adhesion necessary for cell movement (11Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 12Klemke R.L Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J.

Klemke R.L. Reddy A.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37855-37861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the expression vector containing GST-Raf-1 demonstrate a significant increase in cell migration in collagen I. 2C. G. Broustas, and U. Kasid, unpublished data.Cell migration is an integrated process that depends on contractility of actomyosin microfilaments (11Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of myosin phosphatase in fibroblasts by the inhibitor protein CPI-17 causes overall shrinkage and contraction of the cells plus reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with bundling of peripheral stress fibers and formation of membrane protrusions (34Eto M. Wong L. Yazawa M. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins that serve as membrane-cytoskeletal linkers, specifically moesin of the ERM family of proteins (35Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and adducin (36Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), have been identified as potential substrates of myosin phosphatase that also bind to MBS (37Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 38Kimura K. Fukata Y. Matsuoka Y. Bennett V. Matsuura Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5542-5548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of these proteins needs to be sustained to extend filopodia, involving activation of another small GTPase, Cdc42 (39Nakamura N. Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Amano M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Matsuura Y. Leung T. Lim L. Kaibuchi K. Genes to Cells. 2000; 5: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). An important role for activated Raf-1 at the membrane surface might be to locally inhibit myosin phosphatase activity to stabilize the cortical actin network and to enable extension of filopodia. This is consistent with the association of Raf-1 with plasma membrane-cytoskeletal elements and microfilaments (40Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F.

Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25659-25667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MBS has been localized in sites of cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells, and myosin phosphatase regulation of protein phosphorylation at cell-cell contact sites has been suggested (43Inagaki N. Nishizawa M. Masaaki I. Fujioka M. Nakano T. Tsujino S. Matsuzawa K. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 230: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ionizing radiation modulates stress fiber formation in MDA-MB 231 cells.2 Future studies will be designed to examine the role of myosin phosphatase in radiation-related modifications of the cytoskeleton. In summary, our report provides evidence for a signaling pathway in which activated Raf-1 targets MBS and inhibits the interacting protein phosphatase under physiological and stress-related conditions. This offers another way for signaling pathways to connect to cytoskeletal reorganization that underlies changes in cell shape and cell motility. We thank Dr. D. A. Cheresh for discussions and Dr. A.

To date, endogenous binding proteins for both PC2 (7B2) and PC1 (proSAAS) have been identified. Although 7B2 represents a potent inhibitor of PC2, the most important function of 7B2 as regards this enzyme appears to be the absolute requirement of PC2 for 7B2 in the generation of active enzyme, recently corroborated through production of a null animal that lacks PC2 activity. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether proSAAS exerts effects on PC1 other than inhibition, and to establish functional similarities and differences between 7B2 and proSAAS. We first asked whether the N-terminal domain of proSAAS (proSAAS-(1–180)) could stabilize PC1 activity, similar to the effect of the N-terminal domain of 7B2 on PC2. Recombinant His-tagged proSAAS-(1–180) had no effect on PC1 activity in vitro and was unable to protect PC1 from thermal denaturation. Transient cotransfection of proSAAS-(1–225) cDNA with PC1 cDNA into HEK 293 cells reduced the amount of PC1 activity detected in the medium. Surprisingly, cotransfection of proSAAS-(1–180) cDNA, encoding a protein that lacks the inhibitory C-terminal domain peptide, also reduced the activity of PC1 detected in the medium, but the mass of PC1 secreted into the medium was increased, suggesting a proSAAS-mediated inactivation reaction. Similar results were observed in CHO/PC1 cells stably transfected with pro-SAAS-(1–180). Stable transfection of SAAS cDNAs into AtT-20 cells was used to examine the role of proSAAS in a neuroendocrine setting. Unlike 7B2, proSAAS-(1–225) was able to slow convertase-mediated processing of proopiomelanocortin and proenkephalin; however, similarly to 7B2, proSAAS expression did not result in any accumulated differences in the content of cellular processed peptide. In summary, although both proSAAS and 7B2 potently inhibit PC enzymes via a C-terminal peptide, their intracellular interactions with PCs appear to differ significantly, with each binding protein exhibiting unique properties.

Presently, eight members of this family have been identified based on homology to the bacterial proteolytic enzyme subtilisin. Although members of this family of proteolytic enzymes are structurally similar, their expression patterns differ. For example, furin and PACE4 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas PC4 is mainly expressed in the testes, and PC1 (also known as PC3) and PC2 are found mainly in neuroendocrine tissues (2Seidah N.G.

In fact, recent studies show that 7B2 represents a complex bifunctional binding protein with two domains encoding opposing functions. The N-terminal domain is responsible for the production of activatable pro-PC2 (11Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Lamango N.S.

The mechanism by which the N-terminal domain of 7B2 is able to effect the productive maturation of pro-PC2 to an active enzyme species is not yet clear, but it is thought to involve Golgi-mediated cellular processes rather than a direct effect on activation per se (reviewed in Ref. 15Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 63: 69-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently a new endogenous convertase binding protein was identified and termed proSAAS; this protein was shown to inhibit PC1 (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L.

ProSAAS, like 7B2, contains two domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, separated by a furin cleavage site. GST-proSAAS was reported to inhibit PC1 with an IC50 of 2.7 μm (16Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin L. Mzhavia N. Devi L.A.

The sequence responsible for the inhibitory potency of PC1 was narrowed to a hexapeptide, LLRVKR, located in the proSAAS C-terminal domain (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A. Lindberg I. J.

Although the 7B2 CT peptide is highly specific for PC2, the proSAAS CT peptide is apparently not as specific for PC1. The peptide containing the first 24 residues of the proSAAS C-terminal domain, SAAS CT 1–24, is most potent against PC1, exhibiting aK i of 1.5 nm; however, this peptide can inhibit both PC2 and furin, with K i values of 990 and 10,000 nm, respectively (20Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Lindberg I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LLRVKR hexapeptide is even less specific, inhibiting furin with a K i of 420 nm. In the present study, we have directly compared the inhibitory potency of His-tagged proSAAS-(1–225) and the 24-residue proSAAS-derived peptide to gain information on how cleavage affects specificity. In light of the profound effects of the N-terminal domain of 7B2 on pro-PC2 maturation and activity, we have studied the ability of various forms of proSAAS to affect PC1 activity both in vitro and within cells. We find that, although the N-terminal domain of proSAAS (proSAAS-(1–180)) has no effect on PC1 activity in vitroand within Golgi membranes, expression of this domain results in reduced PC1 activity in both stable CHO/PC1 cells as well as transiently transfected HEK cells. Both full-length proSAAS-(1–225) and the N-terminal domain proSAAS-(1–180) were amplified via PCR. The following primers were used: 5′-CGG GGT ACC GCG AGG CCC GTG AAG GAG CCC-3′, directed toward the 5′-end (used for construction of both plasmids); the two primers directed toward the 3′-end were 5′-GCG AAG CTT ATT ATT GAG GGC TCA GG-3′ (for proSAAS-(1–225)) and 5′-CGC GGT ACC TCA TCA GAG GCG GCG CGG GGC-3′ (for proSAAS-(1–180)). The 3′-primer for pro-SAAS-(1–180) contains an engineered KpnI site for subcloning into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen); this vector adds an N-terminal hexahistidine tag as well as 8 additional residues. ProSAAS-(1–225) was subcloned between the KpnI andHindIII sites, and proSAAS-(1–180) was subcloned into the KpnI site. For the eukaryotic vectors, proSAAS-(1–225) was subcloned directly from a zeocin-encoding pcDNA 3.1 vector into a hygromycin-encoding pcDNA 3.1 vector (both from Invitrogen) between the EcoRV and HindIII sites. Truncated proSAAS-(1–180) was amplified via PCR from the plasmid pBluescript supplied by J. Douglass (Amgen) using the following primers: 5′-GCG CGG AAT TCA GCC CGG CTC GTT GGG GCA GC-3′ directed toward the 5′-end and 5′-GCC TCC GAG TCA CGG GGC AGG AGC AGC CTC-3′ directed toward the 3′-end. The PCR-amplified product was ligated into the pcDNA 3.1 zeocin-encoding vector between the EcoRI and XhoI sites. The cDNA was then subcloned into the hygromycin-encoding pcDNA 3.1 vector between the EcoRV and XhoI sites. Construction of the proSAAS prokaryotic vector encoding a protein containing a mutations from 208KR209 to SS in the C-terminal region were generated in a similar fashion using mouse proSAAS-(1–225) as a template. The primers used for generating the first PCR fragment were 5′-CTGCTACGCGTCAGTAGCCTGGAGAACCCCTCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGAAGCTTATTATTGAGGGCTCAGG-3′. The product from the first round of PCR was used as a C-terminal primer with the 5′-primer (5′-CGGGGTACCGCGAGGCCCGTGAAGGAGCCC-3′) in the second round of PCR. The PCR fragment was then cloned into the pQE30 vector at theKpnI and HindIII sites. All cDNA sequence generated by PCR was verified by DNA sequencing. Parental AtT-20, and AtT-20 cells stably expressing proenkephalin (PE) (At-20/PE (21Mathis J. Lindberg I. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2287-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) were used in these studies. AtT-20 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. They were maintained in DMEM high glucose medium containing 10% Nuserum (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Ca) and the appropriate selection agents, 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD;,50% active) and/or 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing PC1 via the dihydrofolate reductase-coupled method were also used, as previously described (22Lindberg I. Shaw E. Finley J. Leone D. Deininger P. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1849-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Smith A.I. Methods in Neuroscience. 23. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 94-108Google Scholar). CHO/PC1 cells were grown in minimal essential medium lacking nucleosides (α-minimal essential medium, Invitrogen) containing 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FBS, with 5 nm methotrexate and 200 μg/ml G418. HEK 293 cells were grown in DMEM high glucose medium containing 10% FBS. Both AtT-20/PE and CHO cells were transfected with the above-mentioned eukaryotic vectors encoding either proSAAS-(1–225) or pro-SAAS-(1–180) using the Lipofectin method described previously (11Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 106 cells were plated into 10-cm dishes and allowed to grow overnight. The following day the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) prior to incubation with 3 ml of Opti-MEM containing 30 μg of vector DNA, 30 μl of Lipofectin, and 15 μl of gentamicin (100 μg/ml). Following incubation, 7 ml of growth medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Sigma) was added. The medium was changed twice a week, and after ∼4–6 weeks hygromycin-resistant clones were selected and subcloned into 24-well plates using the soft agar method previously described (23Lindberg I. Zhou Y. Smith A.I. Methods in Neuroscience. 23. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 94-108Google Scholar). Clones were allowed to grow in 24-well plates for ∼2 weeks. After semiconfluence was reached, 1 ml of Opti-MEM was added to each well; in the case of AtT-20 cells phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was added as a secretagogue, and cells were incubated overnight. The overnight medium was collected, and 100 μl was used to screen for expression of proSAAS by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The LENP RIA used to detect expression of proSAAS has been described previously (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The three highest-expressing clones were used for subsequent experiments. For transient transfections, ∼500,000 HEK 293 cells were plated into 6-well plates on the day prior to use. The next day cells were incubated for 5 h with 1 ml of Opti-MEM containing 2 μg of cDNA vector encoding PC1 alone or doubly transfected with PC1 and either proSAAS-(1–225) or proSAAS-(1–180), respectively, and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated for 24 h with 3 ml of complete medium, after which the wells were washed with Opti-MEM and incubated with 1 ml of Opti-MEM overnight. The conditioned Opti-MEM was collected, and PC1 activity was determined using a fluorogenic substrate (see below). Actual expression of proSAAS-(1–225) and pro-SAAS-(1–180) was verified by QERA RIA (see below). To verify the expression of PC1 and to compare amounts secreted, the conditioned medium was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, or cells were solubilized in sample buffer, and samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 8.8% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blotting using antiserum 2B6, directed against the N terminus of PC1 (24Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1088-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic expression vector encoding 66-kDa PC1 and CHO cells expressing this C-terminally truncated form of PC1 have both been previously described (25Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18408-18413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting using tubulin antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. Kevin Brown, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center) was also used to compare cell amounts per well at the time of harvest. PC1 and PC2 activity were measured using 200 μm fluorogenic substrate, pERTKR-methylcoumarin amide (MCA), in an assay previously described (12Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, each assay was performed in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% octyl glucoside in the presence of a protease inhibitor-mixture composed of 1 μmpepstatin, 0.28 mm TLCK, 1 μmtrans-epoxysuccinic acid, and 0.14 mm TPCK. The assay for furin was performed using the same substrate at a pH of 7.0 in 100 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Brij 35. All assays were performed at 37 °C in a 96-well plate fluorometer (LabSystems) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The total volume was 50 μl. The activity was measured in duplicate or triplicate every minute for a period of 2 h, and the rates of hydrolysis over this time were calculated; the first 10 min were excluded from the rate calculation. Enzyme activity is given in fluorescence units per minute (FU/min) where one FU corresponds to 8.6 pmol of MCA. Recombinant His-tagged proSAAS-(1–225) and SAAS CT 1–24 were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with enzyme before substrate was added. Inhibition constants were determined using the following equation:K i = K i(app)/(1 + [S]/K m), where K m values for PC1, PC2, and furin were 11, 42, and 8 μm, respectively. Approximately 500,000 AtT-20/PE cells were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to grow overnight or until 70–80% confluent at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and starved for 20 min at 37 °C in 1 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then labeled (pulsed) with 1 ml of methionine-and cysteine-free medium containing 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine (ProMix, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) for 20 min. For steady-state labeling, cells were incubated for 6 h in [35S]methionine and cysteine-containing medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After labeling, cells were either homogenized immediately in 1 ml of acid mix (1m acetic acid, 20 mm HCl, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) or further incubated in 1 ml of warm chase medium (DMEM high glucose medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2% FBS) for 2 h and then homogenized in acid mix. The homogenized cells were frozen at −70 °C, thawed, centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed and lyophilized overnight. The dry cell extract was resuspended in 500 μl of AG buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Triton, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide) and centrifuged prior to use. For immunoprecipitation, either 250 or 500 μl of cell extract was incubated with 100 μl of prehydrated 20% protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) at 4 °C with constant rocking. The samples were centrifuged for 3 min; the supernatants were then transferred to fresh tubes and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of polyclonal rabbit antiserum LS41 (directed against ACTH 1–24 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin); or 5 μl of antiserum Xandra (directed against peptide B) (26Lindberg I. White L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The following day the samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed, placed in fresh tubes, and incubated with 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rocking. The samples were centrifuged, and beads were washed twice with 1 ml of AG buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl in PBS, and once with PBS alone. Immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted from the beads by adding 40 μl of 1 m acetic acid and 80 μl of 8 m urea in 32% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. Supernatants were either frozen at −70 °C, or 100 μl was immediately size-fractionated by high pressure gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) in 32% ACN, 0.1% TFA as previously described (27Fortenberry Y. Liu J. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 994-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in each fraction was determined directly by on-line liquid scintillation spectroscopy using a β-RAM system (INUS, Tampa, FL). The flow rate of the scintillant was 4 ml/min; that of the eluant was 0.5 ml/min. Approximately 500,000 CHO/PC1 or CHO/PC1 cells expressing either pro-SAAS-(1–225) or proSAAS-(1–180) were plated into 6-well plates and allowed to grow overnight. The next day cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Opti-MEM medium. Conditioned medium was removed after 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, and overnight. Laemmli sample buffer (5×) was added to 40 μl of conditioned medium, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on 8.8% polyacrylamide SDS gels. Proteins were transferred from gels to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were preincubated in 5% nonfat milk in TBS for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation overnight at 4 °C with antiserum 2B6 (anti-PC1 antiserum directed toward the N-terminal region) diluted 1:1000 in milk. The membrane was washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase) diluted 1:10,000 in milk. The membrane was then washed once with TBS containing 0.05% Tween and twice with TBS alone prior to development with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate p-toluidine salt/p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride). RIAs for the midregion of proSAAS, directed toward the sequence QERARAEAQEAED (QERA), and the C-terminal region of proSAAS, directed toward the sequence LENPSPQAPA (LENP) were carried out by procedures described previously (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated with 10,000 cpm of iodinated peptide and the appropriate dilution of rabbit antiserum in a 300-μl final volume at 4 °C overnight. Antisera for both the LENP and QERA RIAs were used at a working dilution of 1:750 (final dilution = 1:2250). For the LENP RIA, samples were digested with trypsin/carboxypeptidase B as previously described (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to reveal cryptic immunoreactivity. To separate the antibody-bound labeled peptide from the unbound labeled peptide, 1 ml of 25% polyethylene glycol and 100 μl of 7.5% carrier bovine γ-globulin (in PBS) were added. The samples were then vortexed vigorously, kept on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged for 20 min at 5000 × g in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was aspirated, and the radioactivity in the pellets was determined using an LKB γ counter. Subclones of AtT-20/PE cells expressing either no proSAAS, proSAAS-(1–225), or proSAAS-(1–180) were cultured at 500,000 cells per well in 6-well plate or at 1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish. The following day, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of Opti-MEM for 6-well plate and 3 ml of Opti-MEM per 10-cm dish overnight. The conditioned medium was removed and centrifuged, and 100-μl aliquots were subject to either LENP RIA or QERA RIA for analysis of proSAAS expression. To determine the forms of proSAAS present, the conditioned medium was acidified with 0.1% TFA and loaded onto a syringe packed with 250 mg of C4 resin (previously conditioned by equilibrating with methanol followed by water; Jones Chromatography). The column was then washed with 1 n acetic acid, and proteins and peptides were eluted with 1 ml of 60% isopropanol/0.1%TFA. The samples were frozen, thawed, centrifuged, and lyophilized overnight. The dried samples were resuspended in 100 μl of 32% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and separated by HPGPC, and the fractions were assayed by RIA after drying. A similar procedure was performed with CHO/PC1 cells expressing either no proSAAS, proSAAS-(1–225), or proSAAS-(1–180). However, for CHO cells, 20-μl duplicate aliquots of conditioned medium were also used to assay PC1 as described above. Because AtT-20 cells express a comparatively low level of active PC1, the enzyme assay was not performed on media from these cells. Purified recombinant PC1 was obtained from CHO cells as previously described (28Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble mouse furin was purified from the conditioned medium of CHO cells (29Cameron A. Appel J. Houghten R.A. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36741-36749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding either proSAAS-(1–225) or pro-SAAS-(1–180) were subcloned into the pQE30 vector, which adds an N-terminal histidine tag and 8 residues encoded by polylinker. Purification of His-tagged proSAAS-(1–225) and proSAAS-(1–180) was carried out as described previously (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A. Lindberg I. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1833-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with no modifications. Briefly, bacteria were grown at 37 °C until theA 600 reached 0.8–1.0. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm followed by incubation at 30 °C with shaking for 16 h. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in buffer A (6 m guanidinium chloride, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and incubated 2 h at 10 °C, thereby allowing unfolding of the protein. The solution was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 2 h at 10 °C. The protein was gradually refolded along a gradient of 0% B (B = 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl) to 100% B for 2 h. The protein was eluted in 250 mm imidazole; fractions were collected, and proteins were analyzed following separation on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and further purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography as previously described (17Sayah M. Fortenberry Y. Cameron A.

Tyr670, Tyr674, and Tyr675 are located in the activation loop (6Cunningham M.E. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

Most mutations occur within the tyrosine kinase domain, and a few occur within the extracellular domain. Mutation types include frameshift, nonsense, splice site, and missense. Whereas the effect of the first three mutation types, producing aberrant proteins, is foreseeable, the consequences of single amino acid substitutions, caused by missense mutations, require functional studies to formally demonstrate their causative role in CIPA disease and to distinguish them from rare polymorphisms. We were aware of this and proposed an approach based on the analysis of the biological effect produced by CIPA mutations. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that two CIPA mutations, the R774P and the G571R, inactivate the NTRK1 receptor by interfering with the NGF-induced autophosphorylation (18Greco A. Villa R.

Pierotti M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this paper, we extended our analysis to seven additional CIPA mutations. A preliminary characterization of the same mutations, investigating only the effect on receptor phosphorylation, has been recently reported (25Mardy S. Miura Y. Endo F. Matsuda I. Indo Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We performed a more exhaustive study, including biochemical and biological analysis. Our studies allowed the identification of polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations. With respect to the latter, in addition to the interference with autophosphorylation, two novel mechanisms of NTRK1 deregulation responsible for the CIPA phenotype were unveiled; one is based on processing alteration, and the other involves a reduction of the receptor activity. The NTRK1 mutants were constructed by the GeneEditorTM in VitroSite-directed Mutagenesis System (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using as template the NTRK1 cDNA cloned into the pRC/CMV expression vector (plasmid NTRK1wt) (24Greco A. Villa R. Fusetti L. Orlandi R. Pierotti M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are as follows, with the mutated nucleotides in boldface type: 5′-CTGGAGCTCAGTGATCTGAG-3′ for R85S; 5′-CGTGCTGCCGCGGTGCCAG-3′ for L213P; 5′-CCTCCGATCCTATGGACCCG-3′ for H598Y; 5′CTGCTGGCTGTTGGGGAGG-3′ for G607V; 5′-TTGTGCACTGGGACCTGG-3′ for R643W; 5′-CATGAGCAGGTATATCTACAGCA-3′ for D668Y; and 5′-GGAGCTTCAGCGTGGTGC-3′ for G708S. Mutant clones were identified by PCR followed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization in the case of R85S, H598Y, G607V, and G708S. Clones carrying the R643W mutation were identified byMspI digestion of a PCR fragment; the mutation abrogates a restriction site present in the WT. Clones carrying the D668Y mutation were identified by digestion with EcoRV, since a restriction site is abrogated by the mutation. Clones carrying the L213P mutation were identified by nucleotide sequence of a PCR fragment containing the mutation. All of the mutant clones were subjected to nucleotide sequence to exclude possible additional mutations accidentally occurring during the mutagenesis reaction. E25 cells, expressing the WT NTRK1 receptor, have been previously described (26Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). N5.3 cell line has been constructed by transfecting the NTRK1/L213P mutant into NIH3T3 cells and selecting in G418 (400 μg/ml). NIH3T3 and derived cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. G418-resistant clones were cultured in the presence of the antibiotic. Monkey COS1 and human HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, PC12nnr5 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, and 10% horse serum. The NIH3T3 cells (2.5 × 105/10-cm plate) were transfected by the CaPO4 method, as previously described (27Bongarzone I. Pierotti M.A. Monzini N. Mondellini P. Manenti G. Donghi R. Pilotti S. Grieco M. Santoro M. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Della Porta G. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1457-1462PubMed Google Scholar), using 1 μg or 10 ng of plasmid DNA together with 30 μg of mouse DNA. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of G418 antibiotic (400 μg/ml) to determine the transfection efficiency and in medium containing 5% serum, supplemented or not with NGF, to determine the transforming activity. G418-resistant colonies and transformed foci were either fixed or isolated for further studies 2 weeks after transfection. COS1 cells (8 × 105/10-cm plate) were transfected with the DEAE-dextran procedure, as previously described (24Greco A. Villa R. Fusetti L. Orlandi R. Pierotti M.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). One microgram of specific plasmid DNA was transfected with 19 μg of pRC/CMV DNA. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated overnight in 0.5% fetal calf serum and then treated or not with 50 ng/ml NGF for 10 min and then processed for immunoprecipitation. PC12nnr5 cells were transfected using Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (2 × 105) were seeded on collagen-coated 12-multiwell plates and transfected with 100 ng of specific plasmid DNA together with 500 ng of plasmid carrier DNA. After incubation with the reagent, transfected cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) and scored for neurite outgrowth 2 days later. HeLa cells (5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate) were transfected with the CaPO4 procedure. Two days after transfection cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.5% fetal calf serum medium. After treatment with 50 ng/ml NGF for 10 min, cells were processed for immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed with PLCLB buffer (50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF) supplemented with aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Na3VO4. Cell extracts (0.4–1 mg) were precipitated with the appropriated antibodies or with p13suc1-agarose. The precipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and suspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (6.5%), transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and immunoblotted with the appropriated antibodies. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The anti-TRK antibodies and the p13suc1-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; the anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Shc, anti-FRS2, and anti-PLC-γ antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; the MGR12 antibodies (28Tagliabue E. Ghirelli C. Lombardi L. Castiglioni F. Asnaghi L. Longhi C. Borrello M.G. Aiello P. Menard S. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1999; 14: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of Dr. E. Tagliabue. COS1 cells transiently expressing wild type and CIPA NTRK1 proteins were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors. NTRK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with MGR12 antibodies, adsorbed on protein A-Sepharose beads, and washed twice with radioimmune precipitation buffer. After one wash with incubation buffer (50 mm Hepes, 20 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of the same buffer containing 10 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). After washing with radioimmune precipitation buffer, proteins were eluted and subjected to 6.5% SDS-PAGE. 32P-Labeled proteins were revealed by autoradiography of the dried gel. Cells were grown on 13-mm coverslides at 70% confluence and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, one set of slides was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with MGR12 antibodies at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml in PBS; after three washes with PBS, slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG (Alexa) diluted 1:500 in PBS. The other set of slides was permeabilized in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml anti-TRK antibodies; washed; and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit IgG (Meloy) diluted 1:50 in PBS. After washing, the slides were mounted with DABCO-Mowiol and analyzed with a fluorescent microscope using a ×63 objective lens. Wild type and L213P NTRK1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from E25 and N5.3 cell lines, respectively, using the MGR12 antibodies as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with HTNG buffer and once with deionized water and then digested overnight with endoglycosidase H (Endo H; ProZyme), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. We have selected seven recently reported NTRK1 mutations associated with CIPA and involving different regions of the NTRK1 receptor (Fig. 1) (19Mardy S. Miura Y. Endo F. Matsuda I. Sztriha L. Frossard P. Moosa A. Ismail E.A. Macaya A. Andria G. Toscano E. Gibson W. Graham G.E. Indo Y. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2000; 106: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). R85S occurs in the extracellular domain, within a leucine-rich motif; it has been detected in association, on the same allele, with a point mutation of the 3′ splicing site of intron 4. L213P occurs within the first Ig-like domain, and it has been found associated, on the second allele, with a 7-bp deletion causing a frameshift and a premature termination. H598Y and G607V, both in the TK domain, have been detected as triple mutations in association on the same chromosome with a mutation creating a stop codon at residue 9. R643W occurs within exon 15, in the TK domain; it has been found as homozygous mutation. D668Y, in the TK domain, has been detected in four different families and in association, on the other chromosome, with different mutations (splice site, frameshift, nonsense, missense). G708S, within the TK domain, has been detected as a homozygous mutation. As can be deduced from the above description, L213P, R643W, D668Y, and G708S display the features of pathogenic mutations, whereas the others may represent rare polymorphisms. Although the genetic analysis excludes any role of the latter mutations in CIPA disease, their study will formally prove their effect on NTRK1 receptor activity. All of the mutations described above were introduced into theNTRK1 cDNA inserted into the pRC/CMV mammalian expression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The NTRK1/CIPA mutants, as well as the WT NTRK1 cDNA, were transiently transfected into COS1 cells. Three days after transfection cells were treated or not with NGF for 10 min and then subjected to protein extraction. After immunoprecipitation with the MGR12 antibodies, directed against the NTRK1 extracellular portion (28Tagliabue E. Ghirelli C. Lombardi L. Castiglioni F. Asnaghi L. Longhi C. Borrello M.G. Aiello P. Menard S. Int. J. Biol. Markers. 1999; 14: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), Western blot with anti-TRK and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies was performed. The results are reported in Fig. 2 A. The blot with anti-TRK antibodies showed that, similarly to the wild type, all of the CIPA mutants except for L213P produced the two NTRK1 proteins of 110 and 140 kDa, corresponding to the partially and completely glycosylated receptor, respectively. The NTRK1/L213PcDNA produced only the 110-kDa form. The Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine showed a phosphorylation status similar to WT for mutants R85S, H598Y, G607V, and D668Y. A basal phosphorylation was detectable in the untreated cells, due to receptor self-activation caused by overexpression. Treatment with NGF further increased the phosphorylation level. On the contrary, no phosphorylation was detected in mutants R643W and G708S. The 110-kDa NTRK1/L213P protein showed a faint level of phosphorylation, which remained unmodified following the NGF treatment. Data similar to ours have been recently reported (25Mardy S. Miura Y. Endo F. Matsuda I. Indo Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The effect of the CIPA mutations on NTRK1 receptor activity was also investigated by the immunocomplex-autokinase assay reported in Fig.2 B. NTRK1 proteins expressed in COS1 cells were immunoprecipitated with the MGR12 antibodies and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. Autokinase activity was detectable in WT, R85S, H598Y, G607V, D668Y receptors; it was barely visible in L213P and below the detection level in R643W and G708S mutants. The ectopic expression of either constitutively activated TRK oncoproteins or wild type NTRK1 receptor in the presence of NGF leads to cellular transformation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, detectable as the formation of foci of transformed cells (29Greco A. Mariani C. Miranda C. Lupas A. Pagliardini S. Pomati M. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6118-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 30Cordon-Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S. Nanduri V.

The NIH3T3 transfection/focus formation assay was used to investigate the effect of the different CIPA mutations on NTRK1 activity. High doses of plasmid DNA (1 μg/2 × 105 cells) and NGF (50 ng/ml) were used to detect also very low transforming activities. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of G418 antibiotic to determine the transfection efficiency and in medium containing 5% serum supplemented or not with NGF to determine the transforming activity. All of the constructs produced G418-resistant colonies with comparable efficiency, and none of them was able to induce foci formation in the absence of NGF (data not shown). In the presence of NGF, no transformation foci were detected in cells transfected with L213P, R643W, and G708S. On the contrary, R85S, H598Y, G607V, and D668Y mutants induced foci formation, similarly to the wild type (Fig.3 A and data not shown). For each transfection, several G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed by Western blot for the expression of the NTRK1 proteins (data not shown). Selected clones were treated with NGF and subjected to biochemical and morphological analysis (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). NGF treatment induced the phosphorylation of NTRK1 receptor in clones expressing WT, R85S, H598Y, G607V, and D668Y. Concomitantly, cells displayed the typical transformed phenotype, being spindle-shaped and less adherent. On the contrary, no effect of NGF was detected in clones expressing L213P, R643W, and G708S mutants. To study the effect of NTRK1/CIPA mutants in a physiologically relevant cellular context, we used the PC12nnr5 mutant, derived from the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, that does not express endogenous NTRK1 and does not differentiate in response to NGF (31Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Transfection of NTRK1 receptor in PC12nnr5 cells restores NGF responsiveness (32Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 2919-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PC12nnr5 cells were transfected with the CIPA mutants and scored for neurite outgrowth. No differentiation was observed in untreated cells. Treatment with NGF induced neurite formation in cells transfected with WT, R85S, H598Y, G607V, and D668Y receptors but not in those transfected with L213P, R643W, and G708S mutants (Fig. 3 Cand data not shown). Western blot analysis showed a comparable expression for all the constructs (data not shown). Altogether the biochemical and biological data reported above indicate a clear loss of function for L213P, R643W, and G708S but not for the remaining mutants. With respect to the latter, as indicated by genetic analysis, R85S, H598Y, and G607V are most likely polymorphisms, whereas the D668Y has the features of a pathogenic mutation (19Mardy S. Miura Y. Endo F. Matsuda I. Sztriha L. Frossard P. Moosa A. Ismail E.A. Macaya A. Andria G. Toscano E. Gibson W. Graham G.E. Indo Y. Am. J. Hum.

Genet. 2000; 106: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests that a novel pathogenetic mechanism can be exerted by D668Y. The biochemical analysis reported in the previous paragraph showed that the L213P mutation produces only the 110-kDa, partially glycosylated NTRK1 protein, indicating that the mutation interferes with the receptor processing. To determine the cellular localization of the L213P protein we performed the immunofluorescence experiments shown in Fig.4 A. The N5.3 cell line, derived from NIH3T3 transfected with the L213P mutant, was compared with the E25 cell line, expressing the wild type NTRK1 receptor (26Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Staining of permeabilized cells with anti-TRK antibodies (reacting with the NTRK1 C terminus) showed cytoplasmic and perinuclear distributions of the WT NTRK1 protein. On the contrary, the L213P protein showed mostly a perinuclear reticular pattern. The staining of nonpermeabilized cells with the MGR12 antibodies (reacting with the NTRK1 extracellular portion) emphasized the different localization of L213P with respect to the WT receptor. The cells expressing the WT receptor showed a membrane pattern, whereas no reactivity above the background was detected in cells expressing the L213P protein. These data demonstrate that the NTRK1/L213P receptor is not located in the plasma membrane. To address whether the NTRK1/L213P receptor might be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we performed digestion of L213P and WT receptors with Endo H. This enzyme cleaves proteins with early high mannose forms characteristic of the ER species. Wild type and L213P receptors immunoprecipitated from E25 and N5.3 cell extracts, respectively, were subjected to Endo H treatment followed by Western blot analysis with anti-TRK antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the 140-kDa fully glycosylated protein encoded by the wild type receptor was insensitive to the enzyme. On the contrary, after Endo H treatment, the partially glycosylated 110-kDa L213P protein, similarly to the equivalent form of the wild type receptor, was reduced to 80 kDa, corresponding to the NTRK1 core protein. Altogether, our data indicate that the L213P 110-kDa receptor does not reach the plasma membrane because it is retained in the ER. Although at the genetic level the D668Y has the features of a pathogenic mutation (22Miura Y. Mardy S. Awaya Y. Nihei K. Endo F. Matsuda I. Indo Y. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), our biochemical and biological analysis indicated that it does not abrogate the NTRK1 activity. To test whether the mutation could interfere with the recruitment/activation of downstream signal transducers, we analyzed the capability of the NTRK1/D668Y receptor to activate PLC-γ, FRS2, and Shc. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with WT or R643W, D668Y, and G708S mutant receptors and treated with NGF. Cell extracts were incubated with anti-PLC-γ and anti-Shc antibodies or with the FRS2-interacting protein p13suc-1 conjugated to agarose beads. The results of Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.5) showed that the D668Y mutant receptor is able to induce PLC-γ, Shc, and FRS2 tyrosine phosphorylation, similarly to WT. As expected, no activation of the three signal transducers was detected in the presence of R643W and G708S mutant receptors. As control, the expression levels of PLC-γ, FRS2, Shc, and NTRK1 are shown. Our data indicate that the D668Y mutant receptor does not differ from wild type in the recruitment of Shc, PLC-γ, and FRS2. We also considered the possibility that the D668Y mutation might cause a partial inactivation of the NTRK1 receptor not detectable in the experiments above reported, mostly based on overexpression. We thus compared the transforming activity of WT and D668Y receptors at low doses of plasmid DNA and NGF. We transfected 10 ng of DNA/2 × 105 cells and selected foci in different NGF concentrations (range 0–10 ng/ml). In these conditions, we have previously been able to detect transforming activity of the WT NTRK1. 2C. Miranda and A. Greco, unpublished results. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the transforming activity of the D668Y receptor was reduced with respect to the WT at all of the NGF concentrations analyzed. A similar reduction w"

Seven residues, located on one face of a model α-helix spanning residues 59–75, are fully conserved in apoCII from ten different animal species. We have mutated these residues one by one. Substitution of Ala59 by glycine, or Thr62 and Gly65 by alanine did not change the activation, indicating that these residues are outside the LPL-binding site. Replacement of Tyr63, Ile66, Asp69, or Gln70 by alanine lowered the affinity for LPL and the catalytic activity of the LPL·apoCII complex. For each residue several additional replacements were made. Most mutants retained some activating ability, but replacement of Tyr63 by phenylalanine or tryptophan and Gln70by glutamate caused almost complete loss of activity. All mutants bound to liposomes with similar affinity as wild-type apoCII, and they also bound with similar affinity to LPL in the absence of hydrolyzable lipids. However, the inactive mutants did not compete with wild-type apoCII in the activation assay. Therefore, we conclude that the productive apoCII·LPL interaction may be dependent on substrate molecules. In summary, our data demonstrate that residues 63, 66, 69, and 70 are of special importance for the function of apoCII, but no single amino acid residue is absolutely crucial.

Fuku H. Intern. Med. 1999; 38: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This is the only example of a single point mutation in apoCII leading to loss of function, but the interpretation is not straightforward because the protein was not detectable in plasma. The structure of full-length human apoCII in complex with SDS micelles was recently reported based on studies by NMR (8MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Howelett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5414-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein contains three regions with helical conformation spanning residues 16–36, 50–56, and 63–77. The lipase-activating region of apoCII has previously been localized to the C-terminal one-third of the sequence, from about residue 56, whereas the N-terminal two-thirds of the sequence is involved in lipid binding (9Sparrow J.T. Gotto Jr., A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 348: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Vainio P. Virtanen J.A. Kinnunen P.K. Gotto A.M.J. Sparrow J.T. Pattus F. Bougis P. Verger R. J.

In most studies it has been found that apoCII causes an increase in the catalytic efficiency of LPL and not an enhanced lipid affinity of the enzyme (10Vainio P. Virtanen J.A. Kinnunen P.K. Gotto A.M.J. Sparrow J.T. Pattus F. Bougis P. Verger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5477-5482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Olivecrona G. Beisiegel U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Despite a long history of studies on the effects of apoCII, the detailed mechanism for the activation remains unknown. It has been proposed that apoCII binds to LPL and induces conformational changes in the lipase or changes its orientation at the lipid-water interface. As a result of these changes, LPL may become more efficient in binding of individual substrate molecules or in release of lipolysis products (fatty acids) (13Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that apoCII, as an amphipathic molecule, may influence the structural organization of lipids such that substrate molecules become more available to the active site of LPL (8MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Howelett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5414-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Olivecrona G. Beisiegel U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1545-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, synthetic peptides corresponding to the C-terminal part, which does not bind to lipid, are able to activate LPL in vitro (14Voyta J.C. Vainio P. Kinnunen P.K.J. Gotto Jr., A.M. Sparrow J.T. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strongest evidence for activation of LPL via formation of a complex with apoCII come from data showing that LPL and apoCII bind to each other even in the absence of a lipid/water interface (15Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 827: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study we have focused on the region comprising residues 56–79 in human apoCII. Compared with the corresponding region in apoCII from nine other animal species, there are only seven fully conserved residues: Ala59, Thr62, Tyr63, Gly65, Ile66, Asp69, and Gln70 (16Shen Y. Lindberg A. Olivecrona G. Gene. 2000; 254: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the rest of the apoCII molecule there are only two other fully conserved residues, Leu15 and Ala33, but both are outside the activating region. We have systematically evaluated the functional role of each of the seven conserved residues by using site-directed mutagenesis followed by analyses of the secondary structure by circular dichroism (CD) measurements and analyses of activating ability. We have also directly studied the interaction of the mutants with LPL using energy transfer measurements. The results suggest that the LPL-binding site in apoCII consists of mainly 4 residues located on one face of the third α-helix located closest to the C terminus.

A BCA protein assay kit was from Pierce, Rockford, IL. LPL was purified from bovine milk as described previously (17Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The stock solutions contained about 0.5 mg of LPL/ml 10 mm Bis-tris, pH 6.5, 1 m NaCl. 1,2-Di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine was from Larodan Fine Chemicals AB, Malmö, Sweden. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden. An antiserum against human apoCII, purified from plasma and coupled as a hapten to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, was produced in a rabbit by a standard immunization procedure (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analyses were accomplished with the programs Lasergene DNA Star Inc., Madison, WI and Wisconsin sequence analysis package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG). For secondary structure prediction of the mutants the programs at the [email protected](Network Protein Sequence Analysis) web sites were used (available at pbil.ibcp.fr/). Binding and activation curves were fitted using the program Fig. P (BIOSOFT, Cambridge, UK). Two plasmids were used for expression of recombinant human apoCII: pET29a-hapoCII and pET-histag-hapoCII. cDNA for human apolipoprotein CII in the pUC18 vector (hapoCII, a kind gift from Dr. Steven Humphries, London) was connected to anEcoRI linker coding for the cleavage site for factor Xa (coding sequence for factor Xa cleavage: Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-) attached to the first codon of the mature apoCII cDNA sequence. The whole DNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of the vector pET29a(+) to form the expression plasmid pET29a-hapoCII. The recombinant was verified by EcoRI/XhoI cleavage and DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) to express the fusion protein S-tag-“factor Xa cleavage site”-hapoCII (117 amino acid residues in total). For production of pET-histag-hapoCII, the pET29a-hapoCII plasmid was cleaved withNdeI and EcoRI to delete the sequence encoding the S-tag and the thrombin cleavage site. The complementary oligonucleotides 5′-TATGCACCATCATCATCATCATG-3′ and 5′-AATTCATGATGATGATGATGGTGCA-3′, coding for an N-terminal 6xHis-tag, were ligated to the cleaved pET29a vector. The new construct resulted in a vector with the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the lac operator followed by sequences coding for 6xHis-tag, factor Xa cleavage site, and human apoCII. Mutant 63A was generated by overlap extension by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and four different primers (TableI). All other mutants were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The basic procedure for generation of each mutant utilizes a template vector with apoCII cDNA (pET29a-hapoCII or pET-histag-hapoCII) and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation (Table I). The oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, were extended by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. All mutants were sequenced using an ABI 337 DNA sequencer and the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IPrimers used for mutagenesisY63A1a, 5′-GGCTGATATCGGATCCGA-3′Y63A1b, 5′-GCTCATGGCTGCTGTGCTTTTGCT-3′Y63A2, 5′-GCACAGCAGCCATGAGCACTGCTACAGGCATTTTTACTGACCAAGTT-3′T7 terminator primer, 5′-CGATCAATAACGAGTCGCC-3′A59G1, 5′-GCAAAAGCACAGCAGGCATGAGCACTTACACAGG-3′A59G2, 5′-CCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGCCTGCTGTGCTTTTGC-3′T62A1, 5′-GCAGCCATGAGCGCTTACACAGGCATTTTTACTGACC-3′T62A2, 5′-GGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGTAAGCGCTCATGGCTGC-3′Y63F1, 5′-CACAGCAGCCATGAGCACTTTTACAGGCATTTTTACTGACG-3′Y63F2, 5′-GGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTAAAAGTGCTCATGGCTGCTGTG-3′Y63L1, 5′-CACAGCAGCCATGCGCACTCTCACAGGCATTTTTACTGACC-3′Y63L2, 5′-GGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGAGAGTGCTCATGGCTGCTGTG-3′Y63T1, 5′-CACAGCAGCCATGAGCACTACCACAGGCATTTTTACTGACG-3′Y63T2, 5′-GGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGGTAGTGCTCATGGCTGCTGTG-3′Y63W1, 5′-CACAGCAGCCATGAGCACTTGGACAGGCATTTTTACTGACG-3′Y63W2, 5′-GGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTCCAAGTGCTCATGGCTGCTGTG-3′G65A1, 5′-GCAGCCATGAGCACTTACACAGCGATTTTTACTGACCAAG-3′G65A2, 5′-CTTGGTCAGTAAAAATCGCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGGCTGC-3′I66A1, 5′-GCCATGAGCACTTACTCAGGCGCTTTTACTGACCAAGTTC-3′I66A2, 5′-GAACTTGGTCAGTAAAAGCGCCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGGG-3′I66V1, 5′-GCCATGAGCACTTACTCAGGCGTGTTTACTGACCAAGTTC-3′I66V2, 5′-GAACTTGGTCAGTAAACACGCCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGGC-3′I66L1, 5′-GCCATGAGCACTTACACAGGCCTCTTTACTGACCAAGTTC-3′I66L2, 5′-GAACTTGGTCAGTAAAGAGGCCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGGC-3′I66F1, 5′-GCCATGAGCACTTACACAGGCTTTTTTACTGACCAAGTTC-3′I66F2, 5′-GAACTTGGTCAGTAAAAAAGCCTGTGTAAGTGCTCATGGC-3′D69A1, 5′-CACAGGCATTTTTACTGCCCAAGTTCTTTCTGTGC-3′D69A2, 5′-GCACAGAAAGAACTTGGGCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTG-3′D69E1, 5′-CTTACACAGGCATTTTTACTGAGCAAGTTCTTTCTGTGCTG-3′D69E2, 5′-CAGCACAGAAAGAACTTGCTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGTAAG-3′D69S1, 5′-CTTACACAGGCATTTTTACTAGCCAAGTTCTTTCTGTGCTGAAG-3′D69S2, 5′-CTTCAGCACAGAAAGAACTTGGCTAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGTAAG-3′D69N1, 5′-CTTACACAGGCATTTTTACTAACCAAGTTCTTTCTGTGCTG-3′D69N2, 5′-CAGCACAGAAAGAACTTGGTTAGTAAAAATGCCTGTGTAAG-3′Y70A1, 5′-CACAGGCATTTTTACTGACGCAGTTCTTTCTGTGCTGAAGG-3′Y70A2, 5′-CCTTCAGCACAGAAAGAACTGCGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTG-3′Q70N1, 5′-CACAGGCATTTTTACTGACAACGTTCTTTCTGTGCTGAAGG-3′Q70N2, 5′-CCTTCAGCACAGAAAGAACGTTGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTG-3′Q70E1, 5′-CACAGGCATTTTTACTGACGAGGTTCTTTCTGTGCTGAAGG-3′Q70E2, 5′-CCTTCAGCACAGAAAGAACCTCGTCAGTAAAAATGCCTGTG-3′L72A1, 5′-GCATTTTTACTGACCAAGTTGCTTCTGTGCTGAAGGGAGAG-3′L72A2, 5′-CTCTCCCTTCAGCACAGAAGCAACTTGGTCAGTAAAAATGC-3′S73A1, 5′-CTGACCAAGTTCTTGCTGTGCTGAAGGGAGAG-3′S73A2, 5′-CTCTCCCTTCAGCACAGCAAGAACTTGGTCAG-3′V74A1, 5′-GACCAAGTTCTTTCTGCGCTGAAGGGAGAGGAG-3′V74A2, 5′-CTCCTCTCCCTTCAGCGCAGAAAGAACTTGGTC-3′The first four primers were used for generation of mutant Y63A by overlap extension by PCR.

Expression, purification, and cleavage of the fusion proteins by factor Xa were made as described, 2J. Zdunek, G. V. Martinez, J. Schleucher, P. O. Lycksell, Y. Yin, S. Nilsson, Y. Shen, G. Olivecrona, and S. Wijmenga, manuscript in preparation. but in LB medium. pET-histag-hapoCII ant its mutants (Y63A, Y63T, Y63L, Y63F, Y63W, I66A, I66L, I66V, I66F, D69A, D69S, D69N, D69E, Q70A, Q70A, Q70N, Q70E, L72A, S73A, and V74A) were transformed into Epicurian Coli BL21-Codon Plus(DE3)-RIL competent cell. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to anA600 nm of 1.0. At this point the temperature was lowered to 16 °C, and 1 h later expression of human apoCII and its variants was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG. On the next day, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and purified by Ni2+-NTA-agarose as described previously (19Andersson Y. Lookene A. Shen Y. Nilsson S. Thelander L. Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2111-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, buffers containing 8 m urea, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris-Cl were used to produce a stepwise gradient from pH 8.0 to 4.5. The fusion proteins that eluted at pH 7.2 were dialyzed for 24 h at 4 °C against ammonium bicarbonate and were then lyophilized. High performance ion exchange was performed on an ÄKTA purifier 900 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using a Mini Q PE 4.6/50 column. The fusion proteins eluted between pH 6.8 and pH 4.5 from Ni2+-NTA-agarose were dialyzed against 6 m urea, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.2, and were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) before they were applied to the column at a pressure of 5 MPa. Proteins were then eluted by a linear gradient of Tris-Cl (pH 8.2) from 0.01 to 0.15 m. Remaining proteins were washed out by 1 m NaCl and/or 6 m guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). Protein concentrations in all the fractions were measured by the BCA assay. Fractions were combined, and the proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-Tricine gels and by N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses as previously described (16Shen Y. Lindberg A. Olivecrona G. Gene. 2000; 254: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two forms of apoCII were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a homemade instrument at the National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics, Tallinn, Estonia. The expressed proteins were separated on Tricine-SDS-PAGE and were stained by 0.025% Serva-blue G in 10% acetic acid (19Andersson Y. Lookene A. Shen Y. Nilsson S. Thelander L. Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2111-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was put in TBST (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 3% gelatin for 30 min at 42 °C. Human apoCII and mutants were detected by incubation with the rabbit anti-human apoCII serum (dilution 1:100). After incubation overnight the filter was washed 3 × 10 min in TBST. Then the filter was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase) diluted 1:3000 in TBST. Finally the filter was washed 3 × 10 min as before. Bound antibodies were detected by addition of substrate to alkaline phosphatase, and the reaction was stopped by rinsing the filter in H2O. For blotting with the penta-His-tag antibody, the nitrocellulose filter was handled as recommended by the manufacturer. Possible global changes of the secondary structure of some of the mutated apoCIIs were investigated by measurements of far-UV spectra at 25 °C on a CD6 spectrodichrograph (Jobin-Yvon Instruments SA, Longjumeau, France) in a 0.5-mm path-length cell. For this the protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm. For measurement of LPL activity we used an assay mixture of 200 μl containing 2 mg of triacylglycerols from the lipid emulsion. The medium contained 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m Tris-Cl, 20 μg of heparin, and 12 mg of bovine serum albumin. The pH was 8.5. To study the activation, wild-type apoCII and its mutants were dissolved in 5 m urea, 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.2). The protein concentration was in each case determined by the BCA protein assay. Five μl of the stock solution of apoCII, or the same volume of dilutions in 5 m urea, 10 mmTris (pH 8.2), was added to the incubations. The reactions were started by addition of LPL and were stopped after incubation for 15 min at 25 °C by addition of organic solvents for extraction of the labeled free fatty acids (19Andersson Y. Lookene A. Shen Y. Nilsson S. Thelander L. Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2111-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipase activity is expressed in units/mg of LPL, where 1 unit corresponds to release of 1 μmol of fatty acid per min. For studies of competition between the wild-type apoCII and mutants for activation of LPL, the experiments were carried out as described, except for the presence of 2.5 μm Q70E, Y63F, or Y63W in the incubation mixture together with wild-type apoCII. Quinn et al. (20Quinn D. Shirai K. Jackson R.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 35-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of LPL by apoCII can be described by a random mechanism. Based on this mechanism, the velocity of the reaction (v) at substrate saturation is expressed as,v=kcat×L×β×C+KdC+KdEquation 1 where L corresponds to LPL and Ccorresponds to apoCII. This equation was used for determination of Kd and β. Kd characterizes the apparent affinity of apoCII for LPL, and β indicates how much more active the LPL·apoCII complex was compared with LPL alone (-fold activation). When β is equal to 1, apoCII does not activate LPL. The kinetic constants were determined by using the program Fig. P. Two different phospholipids were used in this study. One was 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine, which cannot be hydrolyzed by LPL. This ether lipid was used for studies of the apoCII·LPL interaction. The other was egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, used for studies of the interaction between apoCII and lipids. For preparation of liposomes the lipids were first dissolved in chloroform and dried under nitrogen. The dry lipid was then dispersed in 5 mm Tris-Cl, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.4, and sonicated without break in ice-cold buffer by an MSE Soniprep 150 equipped with a 5-mm probe. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine was sonicated for 30 min and 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine was sonicated for 1 h. The liposomes were kept for 2–3 h at 37 °C before they were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 0.1m Tris-Cl (pH 8.1). Any possible large aggregates were removed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter. The concentrations of phospholipids in the final preparations were measured using an enzymatic kit from Wako Chemical GmbH, Germany. The wild-type apoCII and the mutants (His-tagged, not cleaved) were dansylated according to a procedure described in a previous study (19Andersson Y. Lookene A. Shen Y. Nilsson S. Thelander L. Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2111-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative increase of fluorescence at 490 nm upon excitation at 280 nm was measured after each addition of bovine LPL to the solution of dansylated apoCII in 0.1m Tris-Cl (pH 8.1) with 10 μl of 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine liposomes (final concentration 10 μg/ml). For the measurements, a Spex FluoroMax-2 fluorometer or a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer (model RF500) was used. The fluorescence background of apoCII was subtracted from the experimental values. Binding of wild-type apoCII to LPL was also studied in the absence of liposomes. Binding of apoCII to liposomes was measured by using the change of fluorescence of the single tryptophan at residue 26 as described in our previous study (19Andersson Y. Lookene A. Shen Y. Nilsson S. Thelander L. Olivecrona G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2111-2124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of fluorescence was attributed to binding of apoCII to the liposomes. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of apoCII from the 10 different animal species shows that there are seven fully conserved residues in the C-terminal region (Fig. 1A). All were located on the same side of a model α-helix spanning residues 59–75 (Fig. 1B). To study the role of the conserved residues for the function of apoCII we first made substitutions with alanine using the codons GCC, GCA, and GCT. Ala59 was instead substituted with glycine. The seven mutants and the wild-type apoCII were expressed using the pET29a-hapoCII vector, generating S-tagged apoCII proteins that were purified on S-protein-agarose and cleaved by factor Xa (Fig.2).Figure 2Analysis of S-tagged apoCII on Tricine-SDS-PAGE. The wild-type (WT) and mutant apoCII proteins were purified on S-protein-agarose and repurified by passage over the same column after cleavage by factor Xa.

These mutants were expressed using the pET-histag-hapoCII vector and purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose. When the pH of the elution buffer was decreased to 6.8 or lower, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 26 kDa was eluted in addition to apoCII (Fig.3). For separation of this protein from apoCII, ion-exchange chromatography on a Mini Q column was used (Fig.4). The contaminating protein bound stronger than apoCII to the column and was eluted by 1 mNaCl and/or 6 m GdmCl (Fig. 4, inset). N-terminal sequence analyses of the contaminant gave the sequence KVAKDLVVS, which was found to correspond to an Escherichia coli protein consisting of a domain homologous to FK506-binding proteins (21Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is rich in potentially metal-binding amino acids, such as histidine, cysteine, and acidic amino acids, explaining why it bound very strongly to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose. ApoCII was separated into two forms by the ion-exchange column (Fig. 4,inset). N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that they both had the same sequence, MHHHHH. Mass spectrometry revealed that there was a 260-Da difference between the two forms. This corresponded to a lack of the last 2 glutamate residues at the C-terminal end (the theoretical difference is 258.2 Da). The expressed wild-type apoCII contained more than 75% of the short form. Because the two forms of apoCII showed similar ability to activate LPL (data not shown), we used a mixture of the two forms of each expressed mutant for the following experiments. In another set of experiments we compared in detail the ability of His-tagged apoCII with apoCII purified from human plasma with regard to activation of LPL. From these data we know that the His-tag at the N terminus does not interfere with the activation. 3Y. Shen, A. Lookene, H. Vija, and G. Olivecrona, unpublished data. Therefore, we decided to use the His-tagged recombinant proteins without further cleavage for the present functional studies.Figure 4Purification of His-tagged wild-type apoCIIby ion-exchange chromatography and analysis on Tricine-SDS-PAGE.The fraction eluted from the Ni2+-NTA-agarose column at pH 6.8 (see Fig. 3) was applied on a Mini-Q column.

In contrast, the mutants with alanine substitutions at position 63, 66, 69, and 70 showed a defective function (Fig. 5). For quantitative comparisons, the kinetic parameters Kd and β were determined from the activation curves. Under our experimental conditions the parameters for wild-type apoCII were Kd = 0.29 ± 0.07 μm and β = 6.2 ± 0.1.

Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), 14 for spinach chloroplasts (18Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H.

The c oligomer plays a profound role in the ion translocation, and hence, its structure is of primary importance to understand the function of the rotary F0motor. In the Na+-translocating ATP synthases from I. tartaricus (20Neumann S. Matthey U. Kaim G. Dimroth P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3312-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Propionigenium modestum (21Laubinger W. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7531-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), Gln32, Glu65, and Ser66 of the c subunits serve as Na+ binding ligands (22Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), while equivalents of c-Glu65 serve as proton binding sites in H+-translocating ATP synthases (23Miller J.J. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This acidic residue has been implicated from an NMR structure of monomeric subunit c of E. coli in an organic solvent mixture to be located in the core of the membrane (24Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In a model derived from a secondary NMR structure of subunit c from P. modestum (25Matthey U. Kaim G. Braun D. Wüthrich K. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), c-Glu65 was placed closer to the membrane surface, explaining numerous data on the direct accessibility of this Na+ binding residue from the aqueous environment (26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Kaim G. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).To test these two hypotheses experimentally we took advantage of the fact that c-Glu65 is specifically modified with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD).1 We have chemically synthesized a carbodiimide derivative with a photoactivatable diazirine ring, modified c-Glu65 accordingly, and analyzed the cross-link products formed upon illumination in reconstituted proteoliposomes. We show here that cross-linking occurs specifically with the fatty acid side chains of the phospholipids, demonstrating the location of c-Glu65 to be in the core of the cytoplasmic membrane.DISCUSSIONConsiderable data accumulated over the years that the F0 subunits a and cn together make up the membrane-embedded rotary motor of the ATP synthase with the cn-ring rotating versus subunit a (6Tsumoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Kaim G. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 41Hutcheon M.L. Duncan T.M. Ngai H. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8519-8524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Evidence is also available that this rotation and the translocation of the coupling ions across the membrane are intimately associated events so that one cannot occur without the other. Essential insights into this model have been derived from the Na+ translocating F1F0 ATP synthase from P. modestum, which provides unique experimental approaches to follow the translocation of the coupling ions across the cytoplasmic membrane. Each c subunit of the P. modestum ATP synthase carries a Na+ binding site with ligands contributed by Gln32, Glu65, and Ser66 (22Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This site becomes transiently occupied with Na+ during its translocation across the membrane. Evidence indicates a Na+-selective subunit a channel, which connects the adjacent rotor site of c11 with the periplasmic surface, whereas rotor sites not in contact with subunit a have direct access from the cytoplasmic compartment (one-channel model, Ref.10Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This view is consistent with the ATP-dependent occlusion of 1 Na+ per ATP synthase with a Na+-impermeable a subunit channel (26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Kaim G. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Kaim G. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and it is also consistent with the catalysis of Na+in/22Na+outexchange by F1F0 of P. modestum(26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As has been pointed out previously (44Dimroth P. Matthey U. Kaim G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), these observations are not compatible, however, with models proposing two half-channels in subunit a (two-channel model, Ref. 11Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) through which the rotor sites communicate with the two different sites of the membrane. Another important difference is that the model for torque generation by the F0 motor proposed in Ref. 10Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar is the only one that takes the essential role of the membrane potential into account (26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,28Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Here, we synthesized a photoactivatable carbodiimide (diazirine-BCCD,4), which reacted specifically with c-Glu65. Partial modification of the rotor sites with this compound blocked ATP hydrolysis and Na+ pumping but not Na+in/22Na+outexchange, as expected. Upon illumination, however, the exchange activity was abolished, which suggests that the rotor becomes immobilized through cross-linking to phospholipids. These proved to be the targets of the photochemical reaction, and hence, the c-Glu65 site that carries the photocross-linker must be exposed toward the phospholipids. This is in accord with models in which the C-terminal helices of the c-subunits are on the outside of the ring (5Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 43Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).We clearly demonstrate that the cross-linker reacted exclusively with the fatty acid side chains of the phospholipids. This indicates that the topography of c-Glu65 is within the core of the membrane. The length of the attached cross-linker is about 8 Å when fully extended, and therefore the distance of c-Glu65 to the glycerol moiety of POPC must be at least in the same range to explain the absence of cross-link formation with this portion of the molecule (Fig. 8A). This result is astonishing given the overwhelming evidence for direct access of c-Glu65 from the aqueous compartment by Na+ (44Dimroth P. Matthey U. Kaim G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is in good agreement, however, with an Escherichia coli model of the topography of subunit c within the membrane (43Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which is compatible with the structure of the c oligomer from yeast (5Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).The location of the c subunit binding sites within the membrane core is also compatible with unpublished structural data on the c11oligomer from I. tartaricus. In this structure, a tightly associated inner ring comprising the N-terminal helices is surrounded by an outer ring comprising the C-terminal helices. The outer helices are positioned within the grooves formed by the inner ring of helices leaving enough space between them to form access channels for the coupling ions to reach the membrane buried c-Glu65 residue from the aqueous compartment. Hence, agreement has now been reached on the position of c-Glu65 near the center of the membrane. This location, however, by no means decides in favor of the two-channel model. Our evidence for the direct accessibility of c-Glu65in case of the Na+-translocating ATP synthase (see above) rather warrants a modification of the one-channel model as shown in Fig. 8B. Based on the findings presented here and elsewhere, we propose that Na+ ions enter the a subunit channel from the periplasmic reservoir and pass through it onto the adjacent rotor site, which is near the center of the membrane. From this position, the ion passes toward the cytoplasmic surface through a channel formed between an inner and two outer helices of the c11-ring after the rotor has turned the site out of the interface with the a channel. According to this new concept, one may want to term our model the 1a+11c-channel model rather than the one-channel model.

Evidence indicates a Na+-selective subunit a channel, which connects the adjacent rotor site of c11 with the periplasmic surface, whereas rotor sites not in contact with subunit a have direct access from the cytoplasmic compartment (one-channel model, Ref.10Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This view is consistent with the ATP-dependent occlusion of 1 Na+ per ATP synthase with a Na+-impermeable a subunit channel (26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Kaim G. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Kaim G. Dimroth P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As has been pointed out previously (44Dimroth P. Matthey U. Kaim G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), these observations are not compatible, however, with models proposing two half-channels in subunit a (two-channel model, Ref. 11Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) through which the rotor sites communicate with the two different sites of the membrane. Another important difference is that the model for torque generation by the F0 motor proposed in Ref. 10Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar is the only one that takes the essential role of the membrane potential into account (26Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5887-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,28Kaim G. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar).Here, we synthesized a photoactivatable carbodiimide (diazirine-BCCD,4), which reacted specifically with c-Glu65. Partial modification of the rotor sites with this compound blocked ATP hydrolysis and Na+ pumping but not Na+in/22Na+outexchange, as expected. Upon illumination, however, the exchange activity was abolished, which suggests that the rotor becomes immobilized through cross-linking to phospholipids. These proved to be the targets of the photochemical reaction, and hence, the c-Glu65 site that carries the photocross-linker must be exposed toward the phospholipids. This is in accord with models in which the C-terminal helices of the c-subunits are on the outside of the ring (5Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 43Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).We clearly demonstrate that the cross-linker reacted exclusively with the fatty acid side chains of the phospholipids. This indicates that the topography of c-Glu65 is within the core of the membrane. The length of the attached cross-linker is about 8 Å when fully extended, and therefore the distance of c-Glu65 to the glycerol moiety of POPC must be at least in the same range to explain the absence of cross-link formation with this portion of the molecule (Fig. 8A). This result is astonishing given the overwhelming evidence for direct access of c-Glu65 from the aqueous compartment by Na+ (44Dimroth P. Matthey U. Kaim G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It is in good agreement, however, with an Escherichia coli model of the topography of subunit c within the membrane (43Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), which is compatible with the structure of the c oligomer from yeast (5Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar).The location of the c subunit binding sites within the membrane core is also compatible with unpublished structural data on the c11oligomer from I. tartaricus. In this structure, a tightly associated inner ring comprising the N-terminal helices is surrounded by an outer ring comprising the C-terminal helices. The outer helices are positioned within the grooves formed by the inner ring of helices leaving enough space between them to form access channels for the coupling ions to reach the membrane buried c-Glu65 residue from the aqueous compartment. Hence, agreement has now been reached on the position of c-Glu65 near the center of the membrane. This location, however, by no means decides in favor of the two-channel model. Our evidence for the direct accessibility of c-Glu65in case of the Na+-translocating ATP synthase (see above) rather warrants a modification of the one-channel model as shown in Fig. 8B. Based on the findings presented here and elsewhere, we propose that Na+ ions enter the a subunit channel from the periplasmic reservoir and pass through it onto the adjacent rotor site, which is near the center of the membrane. From this position, the ion passes toward the cytoplasmic surface through a channel formed between an inner and two outer helices of the c11-ring after the rotor has turned the site out of the interface with the a channel. According to this new concept, one may want to term our model the 1a+11c-channel model rather than the one-channel model. Considerable data accumulated over the years that the F0 subunits a and cn together make up the membrane-embedded rotary motor of the ATP synthase with the cn-ring rotating versus subunit a (6Tsumoda S.P.

Evidence is also available that this rotation and the translocation of the coupling ions across the membrane are intimately associated events so that one cannot occur without the other. Essential insights into this model have been derived from the Na+ translocating F1F0 ATP synthase from P. modestum, which provides unique experimental approaches to follow the translocation of the coupling ions across the cytoplasmic membrane. Each c subunit of the P. modestum ATP synthase carries a Na+ binding site with ligands contributed by Gln32, Glu65, and Ser66 (22Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P.

The association of PATZ with RNF4 switches the activation to repression of selected basal promoters. Because RNF4 interacts also with the androgen receptor (AR) functioning as a coactivator and, in turn, RNF4 associates with PATZ, we investigated whether PATZ functions as an AR coregulator. We demonstrate that PATZ does not influence directly the AR response but acts as an AR corepressor in the presence of RNF4. Such repression is not dependent on histone deacetylases. A mutant RNF4 that does not bind PATZ but enhances AR-dependent transcription is not influenced by PATZ, demonstrating that the repression by PATZ occurs only upon binding to RNF4. We also demonstrate that RNF4, AR, and PATZ belong to the same complex in vivo also in the presence of androgen, suggesting that repression is not mediated by the displacement of RNF4 from AR. Finally, we show that the repression of endogenous PATZ expression by antisense expression plasmids in LNCaP cells results in a stronger androgen response. Our findings demonstrate that PATZ is a novel AR coregulator that acts by modulating the effect of a coactivator. This could represent a novel and more general mechanism to finely tune the androgen response.

The effects of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor (AR),1 a member of a large family of ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that belongs to the steroid receptor superfamily (3Mangelsdorf D.J.

The activation of target gene expression by nuclear receptors is not just the result of ligand availability, but it is also tightly modulated by several coregulatory proteins, which function in many cases as signaling intermediates between receptors and general transcription or chromatin-modeling machineries.

RNF4, in turn, associates with a variety of transcription factors (HMGI-Y, PATZ, gscl, SPBP) (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L.

Thus, RNF4 could function as an adapter protein to form protein complexes associated to the androgen receptor. We have recently shown that RNF4 colocalizes in nuclear speckles and can form a complex with PATZ, a novel POZ-AT hook-zinc finger protein (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S.

PATZ is a transcriptional repressor that acts in a selective manner on different promoters, and RNF4, a transcriptional activator, acts as a corepressor of basal transcription in association with PATZ (17Fedele M.

In this work, we considered the possibility that PATZ might function as an AR coregulator in a direct or RNF4-mediated manner. We show that PATZ has no direct effects on the androgen-dependent transcription, whereas in the presence of RNF4, PATZ can significantly repress the RNF4-mediated activation of AR-dependent transcription. We further demonstrate that the PATZ-repressing potential on RNF4 activation is not compromised by the specific histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), suggesting that the transcriptional repression by PATZ is achieved by mechanisms that are different than the recruitment of HDACs. 5α-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) was obtained from Sigma, and TSA was obtained from Biomol. pCMVβ was purchased fromCLONTECH.

The LNCaP androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). FBS was replaced with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Sigma) to remove any steroid contaminant. For transient transfection, LNCaP cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 media with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum 24 h before experiments. After depletion of steroids, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 5 μg of both the sense (pcDNA-PATZ) and antisense (pcDNA-PATZ-AS) PATZ expression plasmids. Cells were transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Control cultures were transfected with the same vector lacking the DNA-coding sequence for PATZ. LNCaP cells, grown at 70–75% confluence, were deprived of serum and incubated at 37 C°. At 4 h after transfections, charcoal-stripped 5% (v/v) FBS was added to the cultures, and cells were maintained for 48 h in fresh steroid-reduced medium in the presence or absence of 10 nm DHT. As internal control for transfection, efficiency cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of green fluorescent protein expression vector, and the number of green fluorescent protein expressing and nonexpressing cells was determined. Cells were harvested for the preparation of total RNA. CV-1 and 293T cell extracts were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with proteinase inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-AR or anti-Myc (Santa Cruz, CA) or with anti-HA (CA125, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibodies and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. The Western blot analysis was performed by using an anti-HA, anti-Myc, and AR antibody, 1:500 dilution in Tween-Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), and the antigenic proteins were detected by ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from LNCaP cells by using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to directions by the manufacturer. 15 μg each of total RNA sample was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde as a denaturing agent and then blotted to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). cDNA probe for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primers DNA-labeling kit (Invitrogen). PSA cDNA probe (214 bp) was a RT-PCR product. The sequences of primers for a specific region of PSA cDNA were 5′-GAGGTCCACACACTGAAGTT-3′ and 5′-CCTCCTGAAGAATCGATTCCT-3′ (22Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The hybridization was performed according to protocolsCLONTECH with ExpressHyb hybridization solution. The film was autoradiographed at −70 °C. Because RNF4 interacts with AR functioning as a coactivator and, in turn, RNF4 associates with PATZ, we tested whether PATZ had direct effects on AR-dependent transcription. For this purpose, we performed transient transfection experiments. CV-1 cells were transfected in different combinations with expression vectors for RNF4, AR, and PATZ along with the androgen-regulated pARE2-TATA-LUC promoter cloned upstream to the luciferase reporter gene. In these cells in the absence of cotransfected AR, DHT did not influence reporter gene activity in the presence or absence of PATZ (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1, AR activated the reporter gene approximately 10-fold in the presence of 10 nm DHT. Cotransfection of an increasing amount of PATZ expression plasmid did not alter either the basal activity of the pARE2-TATA-LUC promoter or the transcriptional response to DHT. Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts showed that coexpressed PATZ did not alter AR concentration (data not shown). We conclude that PATZ has no influence on AR-dependent transcription. Next, because RNF4 associates with both AR and PATZ, we tested the possibility that the PATZ repressor protein could be recruited on an AR-responsive promoter when RNF4 is present. We transfected both expression vectors for PATZ and RNF4 along with AR and AR-responsive promoter. As shown in Fig.2, coexpressed RNF4 further increased the AR-dependent transactivation. This result confirmed the data reported by Moilanen et al. (14Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) showing that the rat homologue of RNF4 (SNURF) had similar effects on AR-dependent transcription. Coexpression of increasing concentration of PATZ not only abolished the RNF4-mediated enhancement of AR-dependent transactivation but also led to a progressive reduction of AR transcriptional response to androgen. The above finding could not be explained by a decreased cellular concentration of either AR or RNF4, because immunoblotting analysis of cell extracts showed that coexpressed PATZ did not alter their concentration (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained when another cell line (HeLa) was employed (data not shown).Figure 2Simultaneous coexpression of PATZ and RNF4 represses the RNF4-mediated androgen activation. CV-1 cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pCMV-hAR, 5 μg of pARE2-TATA-LUC reporter, 1 μg of pCMVβ, and 3 μg of pcDNA-RNF4 alone or together with the indicated amounts of pcDNA-PATZ in the absence or presence of DHT as depicted. LUC activity is expressed relative to the transactivation observed in the absence of DHT and without RNF4 and normalized by using β-galactosidase activity. The means ± S.E. values of least five experiments are shown. Immunoblot analysis of AR and RNF4 is shown at the bottom. 20 μg each of total cell extracts was resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing condition and subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal AR and RNF4 (20Pero R.

To explore the mechanisms underlying the PATZ repression potential on AR-dependent transcription, we tested whether the POZ domain of PATZ is essential for such activity. In fact, it has been reported that the POZ domain can bind and recruit the HDACs on target promoters mediating the repression potential of several POZ containing proteins (23Huynh K.D. Bardwell V.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 24Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 2: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). We used an expression vector (pcDNA-PATZ-ΔPOZ) (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) containing the PATZ-coding sequence lacking the first 145 amino acids constituting a region of high homology with other POZ domains. pcDNA-PATZ-ΔPOZ was cotransfected in place of the complete PATZ in CV-1 cells in a series of transcription assays. As expected, pcDNA-PATZ-ΔPOZ did not influence AR-dependent transcription in the absence of RNF4 (data not shown). Conversely, although at a lesser extent, pcDNA-PATZ-ΔPOZ was still able to repress AR-dependent transcription in the presence of RNF4 (Fig.3). These data indicated that the POZ domain is not essential for the repression of androgen-dependent transcription. However, a repression mechanism involving histone deacetylation could not be ruled out from these experiments. We then used a specific inhibitor of HDACs, TSA, in a series of transfection assays. Fig.4 shows that an increasing amount of TSA (5–900 ng/ml) did not influence the transcriptional response to androgen in the presence of PATZ and RNF4. Our data seem to exclude the involvement of HDACs in the PATZ repression of androgen-mediated transactivation. Very interestingly, we observed that the PATZ repression potential on basal transcription was strongly affected by both the deletion of the POZ domain (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and by TSA. 2R. Pero, unpublished results. Thus, it is very likely that the repressive activity of PATZ on basal or on androgen-dependent transcription occurs through different mechanisms. To confirm that the association of PATZ with RNF4 was critical for the repression of AR transactivation activity, we needed to find a mutant RNF4 that retained the ability to enhance transcriptional response to androgens but was not able to interact with PATZ. The integrity of the RING finger domain of RNF4 was probably essential for PATZ association (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E. Day P.M. Santoro M. Lania L. Bruni C.B. Fusco A. Chiariotti L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7894-7901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas mutations destroying the RING structure were described to affect only partially the ability of RNF4 to enhance AR-dependent transactivation (14Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, an expression vector for RNF4 bearing two-point mutations converting two cysteines of the RING finger domain in serines (RNF4/CS) was transfected along with PATZ and AR in 293T cells for immunoprecipitation and in CV-1 cells for transcription assays. First, we found that RNF4/CS failed to coimmunoprecipitate with PATZ (Fig.5A), confirming that the integrity of the RING structure was essential for such association. We then found that RNF4/CS retained the ability to enhance AR-dependent transcription, confirming the observations by Moilanen et al. (14Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5128-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), but we also found that such activity was not affected by transfection of increasing concentrations of PATZ protein (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis confirmed that in our assays, the stability and the levels of expression of the respective proteins were comparable (Fig. 5, and data not shown). These findings demonstrate that PATZ repression potential on AR-dependent transcription is strictly dependent on the association with RNF4. Two main mechanisms for AR repression by PATZ could be invoked. PATZ could either destroy AR/RNF4 association or associate with AR/RNF4, rendering the complex not functional. To answer this question, we performed a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments. After transfection of PATZ, RNF4, and AR expression vectors, each protein was independently immunoprecipitated, and Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies against the other two. In all cases, we found that PATZ, RNF4, and AR belong to the same complex in vivo both in the presence and in the absence of androgen (Fig.6). When PATZ was substituted with another Myc-tagged nuclear protein (MBD2) expression plasmid as a negative control, we found that only the AR/RNF4 complex was formed. These data show that PATZ forms a ternary complex together with RNF4 and AR both in the presence and in the absence of androgen, thus ruling out interference on the physical formation of the complex and supporting the hypothesis that PATZ renders the complex not functional in the presence of hormone as shown by the transfection assays (Fig.2). We next tested whether PATZ had any effect on transcription of endogenous androgen-responsive genes. For this purpose, we used prostate cancer-derived cells (LNCaP), which are androgen-responsive (25Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) and express both RNF4 and PATZ at similar levels (data not shown). The transcription of the PSA, which is up-regulated by androgens (22Lin M.F. Meng T.C. Rao P.S. Chang C. Schonthal A.H. Lin F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 6: 5939-5947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was evaluated after transfection of the sense and antisense PATZ expression plasmids. Cells were transfected with pcDNA-PATZ, pcDNA-PATZ-AS, or pcDNA empty vector and then treated with 10 nm DHT. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of PSA was higher after DHT treatment but was down-regulated when PATZ was transfected (Fig.7). This effect could not be attributed to the down-regulation of AR expression, because Western blot analysis showed that the amount of AR was comparable in all the samples. Conversely, when PATZ antisense expression plasmid was transfected, a slight but significant increase of PSA mRNA expression upon DHT treatment was observed (Fig. 7). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of endogenous PATZ were very low in the PATZ antisense-transfected cells compared with the nontransfected cells (data not shown). These data indicate that PATZ could play a physiological role in the attenuation of androgen stimuli and suggest that changes in its expression may condition the physiological response to androgens. For several years the mechanism of steroid receptor action has been considered very simple consisting in hormone binding followed by nuclear import, recognition of specific DNA motifs, and direct transcriptional activation (or repression) (3Mangelsdorf D.J.

Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 6: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Extensive research has demonstrated the existence of an increasing array of coregulator functioning, in most cases, as bridging proteins between the receptor and component of transcription machinery (9McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 3: 321-344Google Scholar, 10Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 1: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 12Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these proteins potentially interacts with multiple signaling systems including most steroid receptors. Thus, the steroid response is strongly dependent on the activity of coregulators. In this paper, we describe that PATZ may function as a novel androgen receptor coregulator. In contrast to most AR coregulators, PATZ has a unique feature in that it does not influence directly the androgen response but acts by attenuating the coactivation activity of RNF4/SNURF. Our finding demonstrates that PATZ repression potential on AR-dependent transcription is strictly dependent on the association with RNF4. It will be very interesting to assess whether PATZ could associate with other AR coregulators, or whether it is specific for RNF4. However, it could be hypothesized that a mechanism of attenuation of AR coactivators by proteins that have no direct influence on AR activity could be a more general phenomenon and could represent a mechanism for a finer control of the nuclear receptor activity. In fact, in other instances, AR-dependent repression of transcription occurs through the attenuation of the function of other transcription factors, such as proteins interacting with AP-1 and nuclear factor-κB sites (12Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A particular feature of several coregulators is their ability to influence the histone acetylation status through the interaction with specific histone acetyltransferases or deacetylases, resulting in transcriptional activation or repression, respectively (9McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 3: 321-344Google Scholar). Because PATZ contains a POZ domain, which has been described to bind HDACs, we tested the possibility that PATZ repress RNF4-mediated AR activation through chromatin modifications. Our results using POZ deletion mutants and a pharmacological inhibitor of histone deacetylases (TSA) indicate that histone deacetylation is not involved in PATZ repression. Because PATZ repression potential on basal transcription is strongly affected by both the deletion of the POZ domain (17Fedele M. Benvenuto G. Pero R. Majello B. Battista S. Lembo F. Vollono E.

Lembo, E. A. Palmieri, C. Vitiello, M. Fedele, A. Fusco, C. B. Bruni, and L. Chiariotti, unpublished results. we suggest that the repressive activity of PATZ may occur through different mechanisms. Our data can exclude that the observed repression of AR-dependent transcription by PATZ is a simple consequence of PATZ overexpression. In fact, (i) RNF4, AR, and PATZ belong to the same complex, (ii) a mutant RNF4 that is not able to bind PATZ enhances AR-dependent transcription, and it is not influenced by PATZ demonstrating that our observation may not be attributed to “squelching” mechanisms, and (iii) repression of endogenous PATZ expression by antisense expression plasmid in androgen responsive cells, expressing similar amounts of endogenous RNF4 and PATZ, results in a stronger androgen response as measured by an increase in PSA expression. Our results also show that transfected PATZ is able to repress androgen-induced PSA expression in LNCaP cells although at a low level. We believe that the excess of PATZ can only slightly alter the equilibrium of the endogenous complex formed by AR, RNF4, and PATZ, which are expressed at similar levels in these cells. The mechanisms by which RNF4 modulates androgen-dependent transcription have been investigated (12Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem.

RNF4 can interact with both DNA and proteins (transcription factors) and may promote an assembly of nucleoprotein structures (12Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that RNF4 modulates the transcriptional activities of androgen receptor and SP1 via different domains, and it may act as a functional link between steroid- and SP1-regulated transcription (16Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that RNF4 facilitates AR import to nuclei and retards its export on hormone withdrawal, suggesting that RNF4-mediated tethering of AR in nuclei represents a novel mechanism for activating steroid receptor functions (27Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 17: 2991-3001Google Scholar). Thus, upon binding to RNF4, PATZ might interfere with one of the above mechanisms. Further experiments will be necessary to establish the precise mechanisms by which PATZ represses RNF4-mediated enhancement of AR-dependent transcription. However, our data seem to exclude that PATZ interferes with the binding of RNF4 to AR, because all three proteins belong to the same complexin vivo both in the presence and in the absence of androgen. Finally, both PATZ and RNF4 have been involved in the regulation of cell growth and in human tumors (20Pero R. Di Lembo F. Vizio D. Boccia A. Chieffi P. Fedele M. Pierantoni M.G. Rossi P. Iuliano R.

It will be very interesting to assess the specific role of these molecules and their association in the androgen-dependent growth of normal and tumor cells.

The production of ROS is normally balanced by their consumption by a set of non-enzymatic and enzymatic defenses. When there is an imbalance in favor of the oxidant forces, the cell is in a state of oxidative stress. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the cytosolic Cu,Zn-SOD (gene nameSOD1) is one of the major enzymes involved in the battle against oxidative stress. Cu,Zn-SOD catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide anions, producing O2 and H2O2. A deficiency of this enzyme has serious consequences for the yeast cell during aerobiosis; lysine and methionine auxotrophies appear, and the mutation rate is increased (see Refs. 6Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv. Genet. 1992; 30: 251-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 7Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2670) Google Scholar for review). To be functional, the Cu,Zn-SOD must have a copper atom correctly inserted into its catalytic site. This is achieved by a protein, the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (Lys7p for the yeast S. cerevisiae), which carries the copper to the superoxide dismutase and enables the correct insertion of the metal ion into the catalytic site of the enzyme. Therefore, Lys7p deficiencies have the same consequences as Cu,Zn-SOD deficiencies, and the characteristic phenotype of sod1 mutants is nearly identical to that of lys7 mutants (8Gamonet F.

This class of enzymes, present in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, promotes the elimination of H2O2 and alkyl hydrogen peroxides, and in bacteria the AhpC eliminates peroxynitrite (12Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). All the peroxiredoxins contain a catalytic cysteine that is oxidized during the reduction of peroxides and is itself reduced by a thiol reducing equivalent.In vivo the best known reducing system encountered in eukaryotes consists of NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase (the thioredoxin system) (13Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Five peroxiredoxins have been discovered in S. cerevisiae, each with a special cellular localization and function (14Park S.G. Cha M.-K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5723-5732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, all null mutants of two of the cytosolic peroxiredoxin proteins, Tsa1p and Ahp1p, are differentially sensitive to specific oxidants. The Tsa1p null mutant is very sensitive to H2O2, whereas the Ahp1p null mutant is very sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), an alkyl hydroperoxide (15Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4537-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This indicates that these proteins have separate specialized functions within the cell. We report the oxidative modification of Ahp1p (YLR109w, TPxII) in cells lacking Cu,Zn-SOD activity. This enzyme was discovered in 1999 (15Lee J. Spector D. Godon C. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol.

It seems to play an important role in the scavenging of alkyl hydroperoxide, especially during the stationary phase (14Park S.G. Cha M.-K. Jeong W. Kim I.-H. J. Biol.

The VP2101 and VP1909 strains were obtained by sporulation of strains (isogenic to S288C) FY-73A6 and FG-73A6, respectively. The Δnat1,Δlys7 strain named W303-NL1 was constructed by the deletion/replacement of theLYS7 gene (8Gamonet F. Lauquin G.J.-M. Eur. J.

The amplified DNA fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pRS426 (23Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar). The three mutations within Ahp1p, C62S, S59A, and S59D, were individually introduced into pAHP1 by use of mutagenic oligonucleotides. pV6H contained the coding sequence of Ahp1p with six His at the N terminus and under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. This DNA fragment was obtained by PCR with yeast genomic DNA as a template. The upstream primer contained the +1 to +15 sequence of AHP1, six histidine codons preceded by an ATG, and an XhoI restriction site (5′-GCTCGAGATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGTCTGACTTAGTT). The downstream primer contained the +924 to +942 complementary sequence of AHP1(400 bp after the stop codon) and an EcoRI restriction site (5′-ATGAATTCTGGTGCCGCTGCTTTGTT). The amplified sequence was introduced into the XhoI-EcoRI sites of pFL60 (URA3) (24Minet M. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this construction, the coding sequence ofAHP1 is placed under the control of the promoter and of the terminator of the phosphoglycerate kinase gene. TheHpaI-EcoRI-mutated sequences of AHP1contained in pAHP1-mut were exchanged with the same restriction fragment in pV6H so that the mutated sequences were downstream of the His6 tag. Two protocols were used. The first one was described by Boucherie et al. (25Boucherie H. Dujardin G. Kermorgant M. Monribot C. Slonimski P. Perrot M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second dimension of electrophoresis was carried out on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver staining for the analysis of purified Ahp1p or of total proteins of strains lacking Cu,Zn-SOD, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the protein spots was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. The two-dimensional analyses of the mutated sequences of Ahp1p were performed as described by Maillet et al. (26Maillet I. Lagniel G. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10263-10270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cells (2.5 ml, A 600 ∼0.4) were treated with 1 mm t-BOOH for 1 h, and cells were then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (250 μCi) for 15 min. The radioactive gels were analyzed with a PhosphorImager. VP2101 (wild type) or VP1909 (Δlys7) yeast cells carrying pV6H were grown for 36 h on selective SC-URA medium and then harvested. The cells were broken with glass beads in buffer A (0.05 mNaPi, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0). The cellular extract was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was first washed with the same buffer and then washed twice with buffer A but with a pH of 6.3. The His6-Ahp1 protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 500 mm imidazole, pH 7. Protein concentrations were determined by use of the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The quantities of the monomer and the dimer were determined after gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Blue by spectrophotometric scanning of the entire gel lane at 540 nm on a Beckman type DU-70 spectrophotometer followed by area integration of each peak. The enzyme assay was adapted from the method described by Chae et al. (27Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (500 μl) was buffered at pH 7 by 50 mm Hepes. It contained 150 μm NADPH, 50 nm Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase (Sigma, catalog number Z7051), 5 μm E. coli thioredoxin (Promega, catalog number T7915), and t-BOOH, cumene hydroperoxide (Cum-OOH) or H2O2 as the substrates. After 3 min, ∼100 nm of His6-Ahp1p was added, and the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. We carefully compared two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of total soluble proteins extracted from cells lacking superoxide dismutase activities (Δsod1 or Δlys7) with those for wild type cells. These analyses indicated that the amount of several proteins was modified (increased or decreased intensities) in cells lacking Cu,Zn-SOD. Most importantly, an intense novel protein spot, which was absent on two-dimensional maps of wild type cells, was detected in the cells lacking superoxide dismutase activities (Fig.1 A). This new spot was located close to a protein spot with a molecular mass of 19 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.56 that had previously been identified as Ahp1p (www.ibgc.u-bordeaux2.fr/YPM). Under normal growth conditions the basal levels of Ahp1p are high, but it was present at higher levels in bothΔsod1 and Δlys7 strains. This overexpression is consistent with previous observations (28Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 29Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.-M. Kieffer S. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22480-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) during H2O2 oxidative stress. The novel spot has the same apparent molecular weight as Ahp1p, but its isoelectric point is lower (4.44). To identify this protein, the spot was cut out of the gel and subjected to N-terminal microsequencing. No information could be obtained because the N terminus of the amino acid sequence is blocked, possibly by N-acetylation. Thus, aΔnat1,Δlys7 strain was constructed to bypass this problem. The novel spot was still present in the mutant strain, and the first 20 amino acids could be sequenced, confirming theN-acetylation of the protein of interest. This protein corresponds to a modified form of Ahp1p (YLR109w) with a lower isoelectric point. The identity of this new spot was also confirmed by mass spectrometry. Peptides covering about 63% of the Ahp1p sequence were identified (not shown). Unfortunately, analysis of this part of the protein did not reveal any amino acid modifications to explain the altered isoelectric point. We looked for this form of Ahp1p when cells were subjected to other chemical oxidative stresses. This form of Ahp1p was also found when cells were grown in a medium supplemented with t-BOOH, an alkyl hydroperoxide (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, this altered form of Ahp1p was not seen when the strain was grown in the presence of H2O2. Thus, in cells subjected to a strong genetic (intracellular burst of superoxide radicals) or environmental (t-BOOH in the growth medium) oxidative stress, the cytosolic alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, Ahp1p, was overproduced and modified. This modified form represents inΔlys7 cells a significant fraction of the cytosolic pool of Ahp1p (between 1/4 and 1/2 depending on the experiment, as quantified with the NIH Image software). The mechanistic scheme proposed for the antioxidant role of the peroxiredoxin family and Ahp1p involves the oxidation step of the catalytic Cys62, which generates a sulfenic acid (—SOH). This further reacts with the —SH of the Cys120 of another molecule of Ahp1p creating a disulfide bond (16Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 30Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This bond forms between the Cys62(the catalytic cysteine) of one monomer and the Cys120 of the other monomer, forming a covalent dimer of the enzyme. This bond is then reduced by the thioredoxin (Trx)/thioredoxin reductase (Trr) system which derives its reducing power from the electrons of NADPH. In this way, the ability of the enzyme to make a disulfide bridge between two subunits and to become covalently homodimerized is essential for its activity. We investigated the ability of the forms of Ahp1p found during oxidative stress to form this disulfide bridge. A His6-tagged Ahp1p was expressed from a multicopy plasmid (pV6H) in which the coding sequence was under the control of a strong constitutive promoter (phosphoglycerate kinase promoter) in a wild type strain of S. cerevisiae and in its isogenicΔlys7 strain. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis to check for the presence of the modified form of Ahp1p, in these conditions in a Δlys7 strain carrying the overexpression plasmid (Fig. 1 C). The His6-tagged Ahp1p is about 1 kDa heavier, and its pI is ∼1 unit higher because of the addition of the histidines. Nevertheless, two forms of this tagged Ahp1p were still present in these conditions, although the acidic form was slightly less abundant in the tagged Ahp1p than in the native protein. The proportion of the tagged form with the lowest pI was about 25% of the total pool of tagged protein. This might be due to the high level of overproduction of this protein in the cell, as a multicopy vector and a strong promoter were used, or alternatively it may be due to a slight influence of the six-histidine tag. The second possibility seems unlikely because in cells expressing both the normal and the tagged Ahp1p, the ratios between modified and unmodified proteins are similar (data not shown). The tagged enzyme was prepared from the wild type and theΔlys7 strains and purified on a nickel column; therefore it was highly pure (Fig. 2 A). Nevertheless, a faint fast migrating band was still present below His6-Ahp1p at the end of the purification procedure. This band was not recognized by anti-penta-His antibodies. This band never disappeared regardless of the ionic strength of the washing solutions (up to 2 m NaCl); thus it can be assumed that it is native Ahp1p, which was copurified with the tagged protein because of the presence of covalent disulfide bonds between the two proteins. Furthermore, when the tagged protein was purified from aΔahp1 strain carrying pV6H, this band was almost totally absent. This residual portion is probably the part of protein translated from the second AUG located just after the sequence coding for the six histidines in the N terminus. The oligomerization state of the purified protein was examined on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions to check for the presence of disulfide covalent bridges (Fig. 2 B). All of the enzyme purified from the wild type strain was completely in the disulfide-linked dimeric forms (molecular mass ∼40 kDa) when the sample was not artificially reduced (with dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol). Two major dimeric forms were seen. These are probably dimers with one and two disulfide linkages between the opposite Cys62 and Cys120 as hypothesized by Jeong et al. (16Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The protein purified from theΔlys7 cells presented a different pattern of disulfide-linked dimerization; at least four bands with a similar molecular weight to the dimer were revealed by Coomassie Blue staining or Western blot analysis with a shorter exposure time than that in Fig.2 B, right panel. The two major forms found in His6-Ahp1p extracted from a wild type strain were still present, but two additional forms were also present in equivalent amounts. Furthermore, a part of the tagged protein was still in the monomeric form under non-reducing conditions. Under these conditions between 7 and 25% of the total protein was in the monomeric form, depending on the preparation, as calculated by spectrophotometric scanning of the stained SDS-PAGE and area integration of the peaks. In this oxidative stress context, the pattern of disulfide-linked dimerization of the protein is abnormal, with new, unnatural dimeric forms, which might involve the linkage of the other cysteine of the enzyme, Cys31. Similarly, part of the protein had undergone alterations which affect its ability to form a dimer by disulfide bridges. To assess the peroxide reductase activity of Ahp1p purified from cells under normal conditions or subjected to superoxide anion oxidative stress, anin vitro assay was set up (see “Experimental Procedures”) combining a thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system from E. coli and the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase to be tested from S. cerevisiae. The Trx/Trr system from E. coli can functionally substitute for the yeast system as both proteins were required for the oxidation of NADPH in the presence of substrates of the enzyme (Fig. 3). This thioredoxin reduction system is well conserved in bacteria and yeast, as the percentage of similarity between the Trx1p of both organisms is 65% and that of the cytosolic Trr is 66%. Three substrates were tested as follows: H2O2, t-BOOH, and Cum-OOH. For each of these compounds, the catalytic constants of the enzyme (V max/K m is 0.11 liters·min−1·mg−1 for H2O2, 0.2 liters·min−1·mg−1 for t-BOOH, and 1.9 liters·min−1·mg−1 for Cum-OOH) were very close to those measured by Jeong and co-workers (16Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), confirming the relevance of using the bacterial reduction system with the yeast Ahp1p. This assay was carried out with t-BOOH, and the specific activity of the purified His6-Ahp1p extracted from a wild type strain was compared with that of a Δlys7 strain. The data showed that the activity differs according to the origin of the enzyme. When His6-Ahp1p was extracted from aΔlys7 strain, its specific activity was consistently decreased by 10–20% compared with the enzymatic activity of the protein purified from the wild type strain. We used three distinct mutants of Ahp1p, one mutation is the replacement of Cys62 (the catalytic cysteine), and the two others are replacements of Ser59. This amino acid was mutated because it represented a possible target for phosphorylation that could have explained the modification of pI. The S59D mutation could have mimicked a constitutive phosphorylation of Ahp1p, but as discussed later a phosphorylation is not implicated here. Nevertheless, those mutants gave us interesting information. The two first mutants of the enzyme were constructed on multicopy plasmids carrying the mutated sequences of AHP1 under their own promoter. The mutations were named S59D and C62S. The two plasmids carrying the altered sequences were unable to complement the growth defect of a Δahp1 strain when grown onto a solid medium in the presence of t-BOOH or Cum-OOH, indicating that these Ahp1p mutants were probably non-functional. The proteome of Δahp1 cells expressing the mutated forms of Ahp1p and treated with t-BOOH were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unlike wild type Ahp1p, the mutated Ahp1-C62S did not exhibit the shift of the isoelectric point that was usually seen during oxidative treatment (Fig. 4). For the Ahp1-S59D mutant, the isoelectric point was altered due to the addition of a charged amino acid (an aspartate residue). This caused the protein to migrate on the two-dimensional map to the same position as the previously identified acidic spot. However, the treatment with t-BOOH did not induce a pI shift in this mutant. The two mutated sequences were subcloned into the pV6H plasmid, so that they were upstream of an N-terminal tag of six histidines. The two mutated proteins were purified, and their enzymatic activities were assessed by the in vitro assay described above. As expected the C62S mutant did not exhibit any enzymatic activity whent-BOOH was used as a substrate, but surprisingly the S59D mutant was also inactive. It is logical that the enzymatic activity of Ahp1p is totally abolished when the catalytic cysteine, Cys62, is mutated. In addition a non-reducing SDS-PAGE showed that Ahp1-C62S could not dimerize via a disulfide bridge (data not shown). For the mutated form Ahp1-S59D, the non-functionality of the enzyme is probably due to its inability to make a dimer by a disulfide bond. Indeed, unlike the wild type, this mutant only displayed the monomeric form on a non-reducing SDS-PAGE (not shown). This may be due to a steric effect caused by the side chain of the aspartate residue. Thus, the two different mutations that inactivate Ahp1p prevent the appearance of the modified form of Ahp1p on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels during oxidative stress, suggesting that the functionality of the enzyme may be necessary for its formation. It is well known that peroxiredoxins are progressively inactivated by the substrate (17Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.-P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,30Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This inactivation specifically affects the peroxiredoxin system and not the thioredoxin system (30Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used His6-Ahp1p and an in vitro assay to show that the inactivation was very rapid when the concentration of t-BOOH reached 10 mm (Fig. 5, left panel). We have also studied another mutated form of Ahp1p (S59A), which has a smaller modification of its isoelectric point than the wild type protein during oxidative stress (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, this mutant was functional. Indeed, the strains expressing Ahp1-S59A could grow on a medium containing 1 mm t-BOOH but less well than the strains expressing wild type Ahp1p. It is noteworthy that the strains carrying the mutated forms C62S and S59D could not grow at all with this concentration of t-BOOH. Furthermore, thein vitro specific activity of His6-Ahp1-S59A was identical to that of the wild type protein. However, one major difference was revealed (Fig. 5, right panel); the S59A mutant of Ahp1p was much more resistant to inactivation by high concentrations of substrate. We investigated the ability of His6-Ahp1p and of His6-Ahp1-S59A to form disulfide linkages after 1 h of incubation with increasing concentrations of t-BOOH and with the Trx/Trr reduction system permitting the enzyme to be fully operational (Fig.6) and to reconstitute the intracellular conditions of an increased amount of oxidant substrates in vitro. In Fig. 6, lane 1, where there is nearly 100 times more t-BOOH than His6-Ahp1p, all of the enzyme was in the two dimeric disulfide linked forms previously observ"

We previously identified two genetic elements, age-related stability element (ASE; GAGGAAG) and age-related increase element (AIE; unique stretch of dinucleotide repeats), which were responsible for age-related stable and increasing expression patterns, respectively, and together recapitulated normal age regulation of the human factor IX (hFIX) gene. Here we report the age-regulatory mechanisms of human anticoagulant protein C (hPC), which shows an age-stable pattern of circulatory levels. The murine protein C gene showed an age-related stable expression pattern in general agreement with that of the hPC. Through longitudinal analyses of transgenic mice carrying hPC minigenes, the hPC gene was found to have a functional age-related stability element (hPC ASE; CAGGAAG) in the 5′-upstream proximal region but was found to lack any age-related increase element. Three other ASE-like sequences present in the hPC gene, GAGGAAA and (G/C)AGGATG, also bound nuclear proteins but were not active in the age regulation of the hPC gene. Functional hPC ASE and hFIX ASE were apparently generated through convergent evolution, and hFIX ASE can fully substitute for the hPC ASE in conferring age-related stable expression pattern of the hPC gene. In the presence of the hPC ASE, hFIX AIE can convert the age-stable expression pattern of the hPC gene to a hFIX-like age-related increase pattern. These results support the universality of ASE and AIE functions across different genes. Clearance of hPC protein from the circulation was not significantly affected by age.

Blood. 2000; 95: 3678-3682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human PC1 is an important component of the anticoagulation pathway, while hFIX is a key blood procoagulation factor playing critical roles in blood coagulation (8Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,9Dahlback B. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1627-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies showed that the activity and plasma levels of hFIX increased significantly with advancing age in normal human populations (3Lowe G.O.D. Rumley A. Woodward M. Morrison C.E.

Pathol. 1993; 99: 687-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In comparison with hFIX, the plasma levels of hPC showed only marginal age-associated changes (3Lowe G.O.D. Rumley A. Woodward M.

Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We previously identified two genetic elements, ASE and AIE (renamed from AE 5′ and AE 3′, respectively), which are required for age-related stability and increase of hFIX expression, respectively (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ASE, originally identified as a footprint sequence between nucleotide (nt) −802 and nt −784 of the hFIX gene, has a core sequence, GAGGAAG, matching the transcriptional factor PEA-3 consensus sequence ((G/C)AGGA(A/T)G) (13Xin J-H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,14Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P-A. Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 937-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). AIE, present in the middle of the hFIX 3′-untranslated region (UTR), is composed of 102-bp dinucleotide repeats (AT, GT, and CA) and has the potential to form three distinct stem loop structures in its RNA form (15Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Murine factor IX (mFIX) shows an age-related increase in both circulatory protein levels and gene expression in the liver (16Yao S.N. DeSilva A.H. Kurachi S. Samuelson L.C. Kurachi K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,17Kurachi S. Hitomi E. Kurachi K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the mFIX gene also contains ASE-like sequences in the 5′-upstream and a stretch of 106-bp dinucleotide repeats in the 3′-UTR (18Wu S-M. Stafford D.W. Ware J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). New critical questions have emerged, including whether the age-regulatory elements ASE and AIE can play roles in other genes, especially anticoagulation factor genes, and what are the fundamental genetic mechanisms responsible for the age-related increase of blood coagulation activity. To address these issues, we focused our efforts on the hPC gene. Human PC and hFIX share similarities in protein structure and gene coding region organization, but the 5′-flanking regions and 3′-UTRs of their genes are grossly dissimilar (15Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar,19Salier J-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol.

A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For example, the 5′-flanking region of the hFIX gene, from approximately beyond nt −350, where the functional ASE is located, was derived from retrotransposed LINE-1 sequences (22Hsu W. Kawamura S. Fontaine J-M. Kurachi K. Kurachi S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1782-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), while the corresponding 5′-flanking region of the hPC gene was not (20Miao C.H. Ho W.T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 3′-UTR of the hFIX gene is about 1.4 kb in length, whereas that of the hPC gene is only 295 bp, and no AIE-like element or dinucleotide repeats are present (15Yoshitake S. Schach B.G. Foster D.C. Davie E.W. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3736-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 21Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). These differences between the hFIX and hPC genes may result in the substantial dissimilarity in their age-related expression patterns. In this paper, we report the basic genetic mechanisms of age regulation of the hPC gene and the functional universality of the hFIX-derived ASE and AIE, thus laying the foundation for comprehensive understanding of the age-related increase in blood coagulation activity. Restriction enzymes and DNA modification enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs. Radioactive nucleotides, [α-32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]ATP, were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Mouse anti-hPC monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-hPC antibody were purchased from Celsus Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Invitrogen. Antibodies used for hFIX-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were described previously (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin for mammalian cell cultures were obtained from Invitrogen. Fugene-6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, were obtained from ATCC. C57BL/6, SJL, and CD-1 mice used for generating transgenic animals were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. Human PC minigene construct, −1462hPCm1, was first constructed and subsequently used to generate other hPC minigene constructs. The hPC gene nucleotide numbering system used was that with the major transcriptional initiation site defined as nt +1 (20Miao C.H. Ho W.T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 3022-bp sequence spanning nt −1462 through nt +1560 of the hPC gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using human genomic DNA as a template, and 5′ forward primer withSphI linker (5′-CAAGCATGCGAATTCTGTAAGCATTTCCT-3′) and 3′ reverse primer with MscI linker (5′-GAAATTCCCCAGGTGGCCAC-3′). The amplified fragment was then inserted into pUC119-hPC (kindly provided by Dr. Francis Castellino, University of Notre Dame) to replace its 5′ portion released bySphI/MscI double digestion. The 3′-end portion of the resultant intermediate construct, from the internalSse8387I site at nt +10497 in the 3′-UTR to theEcoRI site outside of the poly(A) attachment site (nt +10783), was released by Sse8387I/EcoRI double digestion. This portion was then replaced by a PCR-amplified fragment with Sse8387I/EcoRI sticky ends (612 bp in length, spanning nt +10497 through +11108 with a 325-bp extension into the 3′-flanking region sequence of the hPC gene), thus generating minigene −1462hPCm1. By replacing the 5′ portion of −1462hPCm1 (nt −1462 through +1560) with PCR-amplifiedSphI/MscI fragments, spanning nt −849, −802, or −82 to nt +1560, new minigenes −849hPCm1, −802hPCm1, or −82hPCm1 were generated, respectively. ASE/−802hPCm1 or ASE/−82hPCm1 were similarly constructed by inserting a single copy of a 32-bp fragment containing hFIX ASE (nt −802 through −771 of the hFIX gene) withSphI sticky ends into −802hPCm1 or −82hPCm1 at the 5′-endSphI site, respectively. Minigene pseudoASE/−802hPCm1 was generated by inserting a 23-bp fragment containing pseudo-ASE (nt −878 through −856 of the hPC gene) with SphI sticky ends into −802hPCm1 at the 5′-end SphI site. Minigene −1462hPCm1/AIE or −1462hPCm1/AIEr was constructed by inserting a 102-bp hFIX AIE fragment (nt +32142 through +32243 of the hFIX gene) withSse8387I linker into the 3′-UTR of −1462hPCm1 at theSse8387I site in a normal or reversed orientation, respectively. ASE/−1462hPCm1/AIE was generated by inserting above hFIX ASE into −1462hPCm1/AIE at the 5′-end SphI site. Human FIX minigenes, ASEmin/−416FIXm1 and AIE/−416FIXm1/ASE, were constructed by inserting a single copy of the 17-bp minimum ASE sequence (ASEmin: nt −795 through −779 of the hFIX gene) or a copy of the above AIE into minigenes −416FIXm1 and −416FIXm1/ASE (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) at the 5′-endSphI site, respectively. Minigene −802FIXm1/mDR was constructed by inserting a 106-bp dinucleotide repeat sequence of the mFIX gene (nt +2018 through +2123 of the mFIX cDNA) (18Wu S-M. Stafford D.W. Ware J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 86: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) at theBamHI site of −802FIXm1 (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PCR-amplified sequences and ligation sites of all of the new constructs were confirmed by automated dideoxy sequencing. Northern blot analysis of mouse liver RNA was carried out as previously described (16Yao S.N. DeSilva A.H. Kurachi S. Samuelson L.C. Kurachi K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A murine PC (mPC) probe (223 bp, from nt +14609 to nt +14832 of the mPC gene) (23Jalbert L.R. Rosen E.D. Lissens A. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was prepared by PCR amplification (5′ primer, 5′-TTCTTTCGGGGTACCTGG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GTCCTCTGTCTTGGTACT-3′) using mouse genomic DNA as the template. Liver total RNAs (15 μg/lane) were prepared from animals at various late developmental stages and postnatal ages (16Yao S.N. DeSilva A.H. Kurachi S. Samuelson L.C. Kurachi K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An hPC probe corresponding to exon 9 (365 bp, from nt +8385 to +8749 in genomic nucleotide numbering), was prepared by PCR (5′ primer, 5′-AGAGTATGACCTGCGGCG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-CACAGCATGTTCTCAGACAC-3′) (20Miao C.H. Ho W.T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,21Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were prepared from liver tissues of nontransgenic or transgenic mice. Filters were rehybridized with the 32P-labeled RNR 18 cDNA (ribosomal RNA 18 S) to verify loading of equivalent amounts of RNA in each lane. RNA bands were quantified by a PhosphorImager (STORM; Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). HepG2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 25 mmHEPES buffer, 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Transfection was carried out by using Fugene 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient expression activities of minigene constructs were determined with HepG2 cells as follows. Mixtures of expression constructs (total of 3 μg/well, six-well plate) composed of an hPC minigene construct and pCH110 (β-galactosidase expression vector) (19Salier J-P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at a 3:1 (w/w) ratio were transfected into HepG2 cells by using Fugene-6 reagent and serum-free medium (3:97, v/v). Human PC produced was quantified by hPC-specific ELISA using a three-antibody system (24Turkey A. Wang J-M. Kurachi K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar): mouse anti-hPC monoclonal antibody for antigen catching, rabbit polyclonal anti-hPC antibody as the second antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG for the detection. Average net hPC production levels from four or five independent assays were obtained after subtracting the background hPC produced by HepG2 cells transfected only with pCH110. Transgenic mice were constructed and subjected to longitudinal analyses as previously described (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Human PC minigenes released from minigene expression vectors by HindIII/EcoRI digestion were purified and microinjected into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 × SJL mice (1–2 ng of DNA/egg) and implanted into foster mother animals (CD-1). Founder animals were genotyped at 2–3 weeks of age by quantitative multiplex PCR analyses of tail tissue DNA samples. Two pairs of primer were used: one specific to the 746-bp hPC transgene fragment corresponding to exons 2–9 (nt +1577 through +9911 in the genomic nucleotide number (20Miao C.H. Ho W.T. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)) and one that produced a 494-bp mouse β-globin gene fragment (endogenous control) (nt +2590 through +3083 (25Konkel D.A. Tilghman S.M. Leder P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1125-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)). To be quantitative, 50 ng of genomic DNA from the tail tissue, 200 ng of hFIX primers, and 100 ng of mouse β-globin primers were applied. The transgene copy number was determined based on the relative ratio between the hFIX-specific band and that of the β-globin gene. Animals carrying ≥5–10 copies of the hPC transgene were selected for further analyses. Founders were back-crossed with nontransgenic mice (C57BL/6 × SJL) to generate F1 progeny animals. Homozygous F2 animals were generated by crossing among heterozygous F1 littermates. The zygosity status of animals was determined by quantitative multiplex PCR analysis as described above. Longitudinal blood collection via snipped tails was started at 1 month of age from individual animals of 4–8 representative founders for each minigene construct. Animals of subsequent generations of representative lines were similarly subjected to longitudinal analyses. Circulatory hPC or hFIX levels of transgenic mice at each age point were quantified by duplicated ELISA. Human FIX ELISA was applied as previously described (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To minimize experimental fluctuations from assay to assay in the longitudinal analysis, overlapped serum samples from the previous assay group were included in each assay. Transgene positional effect can substantially affect absolute levels of transgene expression among individual animals. Therefore, unless otherwise mentioned, our longitudinal animal analyses were focused on determining the age-related pattern of minigene expression for each individual animal. All animal experiments were carried out under the institutional guidelines for ethical animal use (Office for Protection from Research Risk No. A3114-01). EMSAs of pseudo-ASE, hPC ASE, and other similar elements were carried out as previously described (26Kurachi S. Furukawa M. Salier J-P Wu C-T Wilson E.J. French F.S. Kurachi K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear extracts (NEs) were prepared from HepG2 cells or liver tissues of normal mice (C/57BL/6) at 5 months of age. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and used to prepare double-stranded (ds; see Fig. 4) oligonucleotides (sequences shown in the figure legend). These oligonucleotides were labeled with32P to a specific activity of ∼1.9 × 109 cpm. Aliquots (20,000 cpm) were incubated with 10 μg of NEs in the presence of 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) in DNA binding buffer for 20 min at room temperature and subjected to vertical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. For competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides (double-stranded) in the amount of 100-fold excess were added to the labeled ones. Half-clearance times of circulatory hPC were determined as previously described for hFIX (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with appropriate modifications. Aliquots of plasma-derived hPC preparation (4 μg/0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline; Hematologic Technologies, Inc.) were injected via tail vein into three separate groups of C57BL/6 × SJL mice of 2, 8–10, and 18–20 months of age (n = 3 per group), respectively. Circulatory hPC levels were determined by ELISA using serum samples, which were prepared from blood samples (∼50-μl aliquots) collected via snipped tails at 10 min and at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 h after protein injection. To provide the rationale for utilizing transgenic mice for analyzing age regulation of hPC gene expression, we first examined the age-related expression pattern of the mPC gene (Fig.1A). Mouse PC liver mRNA levels rapidly increased during the perinatal stage (Fig.1A, lanes 2–8), reaching the young adult level around the time of weaning (∼3 weeks of age), followed by relative stable levels through old age (20 months) (Fig. 1A,lanes 8–14 and B). The first series of hPC minigenes were constructed to identify genetic elements responsible for age-related regulation of the hPC gene, specifically focusing on the PEA-3-like elements (Fig.2A). There were two PEA-3-like elements present in the proximal 5′-upstream of the gene. The first element was located at nt −832 through −826 (CAGGAAG; designated as hPC ASE), which is consistent with the PEA-3 consensus motif and different from the hFIX ASE (GAGGAAG) by one nucleotide. The second element was present at nt −871 through −865 (GAGGAAA; designated as pseudo-ASE), differing from the PEA-3 consensus motif by one nucleotide. All of the hPC minigenes showed similar transient expression activities as assayed with HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). The second series of hPC minigenes were constructed with hFIX-derived ASE or AIE (Fig. 2B). The presence of ASE did not have any significant effect on transient hPC expression in HepG2 cells, while the presence of AIE in hPC minigenes lowered their transient expression activities by ∼30% (Fig. 2B) in agreement with our previous observations on hFIX minigenes containing AIE (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K. Science. 1999; 285: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice carrying minigenes −1462hPCm1 (n = 40), −849hPCm1 (n = 31), −802hPCm1 (n= 35), or −82hPCm1 (n = 44) were constructed and subjected to longitudinal analyses of circulatory hPC. Age-related patterns of circulatory hPC levels in individual animals are shown in Fig. 3, A–D. Animals carrying either −1462hPCm1 or −849hPCm1 showed remarkable age-related stability in circulatory hPC at various levels as high as ∼3 μg/ml plasma, similar to natural hPC levels in humans (Fig. 3, Aand B). The stability of circulatory hPC correlated with similar age-stable hPC mRNA levels in the liver (Fig.3F), and was consistent with the absence of any AIE-like element in the hPC gene. These observations were reproducible in all animals under investigation, regardless of founder line, initial prepubertal hPC levels, sex, generation (including F2 animals), or zygosity status of the transgene. In contrast, circulatory hPC levels of animals carrying −802hPCm1 or −82hPCm1, which showed levels as high as ∼590 or ∼40 ng/ml serum, respectively, at 1 month of age, rapidly decreased through puberty to much lower or undetectable levels for the rest of their life spans (Fig. 3, C andD). This rapid age-related decline was observed in all animals, independent of founder line, initial prepubertal levels, sex, or zygosity status of the transgenes, and correlated with a similar decline in the steady state level of liver hPC mRNA (Fig.3G). These results suggested that the region nt −849 through −803, where a PEA-3 element (CAGGAAG; hPC ASE) located, was critically required for age-stable expression of the hPC gene. Another PEA-3 like element present in the region nt −871 through −865, GAGGAAA (pseudo-ASE), was also tested with transgenic mice carrying pseudoASE/−802hPCm1. Animals carrying pseudoASE/−802hPCm1 showed an age-related decline in hPC expression (n = 23) (Fig. 3E) similar to those carrying −802hPCm1, indicating that pseudo-ASE does not function as an age stability element. In EMSA, pseudo-ASE and hPC ASE bound different liver nuclear proteins, as evidenced by the absence of cross-competition (Fig.4, lanes 7 and14) and a subtle difference in the apparent sizes between them (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 10). Furthermore, hFIX ASE efficiently out-competed hPC ASE for its binding nuclear protein (Fig. 4, lane 13), indicating that hFIX ASE (GAGGAAG) and hPC ASE (CAGGAAG) bind the same nuclear protein. Protein binding to pseudo-ASE was present in HepG2 NEs at a significant concentration level (Fig. 4, lane 2), while the hPC ASE-binding protein was present in HepG2 NEs at a very low level, if at all (Fig. 4, lane 9). Human PC minigenes used in this study had two additional consensus PEA-3 sequences. One is in intron 1 (nt +694 to +700; GAGGATG; designated as Intron1PEA-3), and the other is in the exon 9 coding region (nt +10286 to +10292; CAGGATG; designated as Exon9PEA-3) (21Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, they were not able to confer age-related stabilization effects on hPC gene expression as evidenced by age-unstable expression patterns of −802hPCm1 as well as −82hPCm1 in animals (Fig. 3,C and D). EMSA indicated that both elements bound nuclear proteins present in both liver and HepG2 cell NEs (Fig.5A, lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9), but like in the case of pseudo-ASE above, these proteins were found to be different from those binding to functional hPC or hFIX ASE as shown by cross-competition assays (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 12). This was further supported by cross-competition assays using 32P-labeled hPC ASE, unlabeled Intron1PEA-3 (GAGGATG), or Exon9PEA-3 (CAGGATG) (Fig.5B, lanes 8 and 9). Cross-competition assays also showed that Intron1PEA-3 and Exon9PEA-3 bound a common nuclear protein (Fig. 5B, lanes 10 and 11). To address the possible functional universality of ASE elements, another series of hPC minigenes constructed with hFIX-derived ASE (Fig. 2B) were longitudinally analyzed for age-related expression in transgenic mice. Unlike animals carrying −82hPCm1 (Fig. 3D) or −802hPCm1 (Fig. 3C), transgenic animals carrying ASE/−82hPCm1 (n = 32) or ASE/−802hPCm1 (n = 30), which have the hFIX ASE inserted at the 5′-upstream position of hPC minigenes, reproducibly showed age-stable patterns of circulatory hPC at least up to 9 months of age (the last assay time points) (Fig.6, A and B). The observed conversion in age-regulatory patterns was independent of founder animals, generation, initial pubertal levels, sex, or zygosity state. This age stability of the hPC circulatory levels paralleled similar age-stable levels of hPC mRNA in the liver (Fig.6F). Thus, we conclude that the hFIX-derived ASE can functionally replace the hPC endogenous ASE. ASEmin/−416FIXm1, a hFIX minigene with only a 17-bp nucleotide sequence containing the 7-bp essential PEA-3 motif sequence (GAGGAAG) in the middle inserted at the 5′-end of minigene −416FIXm1, also fully converted the age-unstable hFIX expression of −416FIXm1 (12Kurachi S. Deyashiki Y. Takeshita J. Kurachi K.

Upon Ca2+/calmodulin binding, the FAD of the reductase domain transfers reducing equivalents from NADPH to FMN, which then reduces the heme iron located in the oxygenase domain.

The ultrafast rebinding of a dissociated NO molecule to the eNOS heme site, a process called geminate recombination, involves NO molecules that do not escape into the solvent. The kinetics of this rebinding are very sensitive to the environment of the heme. This ligand rebinding is studied at various NO concentrations. In this work, we show that varying the NO to the protein ratio induces changes in the geminate recombination rate for eNOS possessing bound BH4. In contrast, the rate of NO rebinding to BH4-depleted eNOS was independent of NO concentration and much slower than in the presence of the cofactor. Our data strongly suggest the existence of a new non-heme binding site for NO that depends on the presence of BH4. l-Arginine, β-NADPH (99.8% purity), (6R)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and calmodulin, as well as other chemicals used for buffer preparations, were purchased from Sigma. Diluted NO gas at 1 and 10% (v/v) in nitrogen and argon, respectively, and high purity argon (99.9999%) were obtained from Air Products and Chemicals, Allentown, PA. Recombinant human eNOS was prepared using the baculovirus expression system in sf9 cells with replenishment of sepiapterin as described previously (8Chen P.-F. Tsai A.-L. Berka V. Wu K.K. J. Biol.

The purified enzyme containing 60% BH4 was stored in liquid nitrogen in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 0.15 m NaCl.

The preparation of BH4-bound eNOS prepared from E. coli containing 70% BH4 was described previously (10Berka V. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9373-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 70 μl of eNOS (60 μm) were mixed to a 20-μl solution containing 10 mml-arginine, 500 μmCaCl2, 400 μm calmodulin, and 20 mg/ml 1,2-diheptanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphotidylcholine (DHPC) in a 1-mm optical path quartz cuvette kept in an ice bath. The cuvette was sealed with a rubber stopper and degassed by repetitive cycles of vacuum and argon purging. 10 μl of air-free NADPH (20 mm) was then added to the eNOS solution using a gas-tight syringe (Dynatech), followed by another cycle of vacuum and argon purging. The completion of the reduction step was achieved in about 10–15 min as measured by the absorption spectra. 1% NO gas was then introduced in the cell using a gas train. When lower NO concentrations were used, the required volume of NO at 1% was added to the cell at a constant total pressure of 1.3 bar by means of an airtight syringe. The cell was gently shaken for 20 min at (3 ± 1) °C. This procedure assured an efficient equilibration of NO between the liquid and gas phases. The absorption spectrum was subsequently recorded. Time-resolved spectroscopy was performed with the 30-Hz pump-probe laser system described previously (11Martin J.-L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cell was placed in a thermostated cell holder at (20.0 ± 0.5) °C. Photodissociation of NO was achieved using an excitation pulse centered at 563 nm with a 40-femtosecond duration. The wavelength of this pump pulse matches the α-band of NO-liganded eNOS. The transient spectrum obtained after a variable delay was probed with a white light continuum pulse, whose group velocity dispersion was minimized at 410 nm by a set of prisms. 20 to 40 scans were recorded in durations of 200 ps and 4 ns and averaged (in such scan, each time point of a kinetic trace at a given wavelength represents the average of 300 laser shots). In some experiments, the dwell time was increased from 10 to 30 s, and 20 scans were averaged at a few time points to improve the signal to noise ratio in transient spectra. Analysis of the data was performed by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the time-wavelength matrix (12Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipies. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1988Google Scholar). The kinetics associated with the SVD components having the highest singular values were fit with a minimum number of exponentials. Reduced and carbon monoxide-bound myoglobin and hemin were monitored in the same conditions and used as references of flat kinetics in the time scales of 200 ps to 4 ns (13Petrich J.W. Poyat C. Martin J.-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Binding of NO to reduced eNOS induces an absorption increase at 436 nm of the Soret band and a simultaneous decrease at 410 nm that corresponds to the absorption maximum of the reduced unliganded heme. Spectral changes are also observed in the Q-bands, as shown by a progressive red shift of the 560-nm band to 569 nm upon NO addition. Fig.1 shows the absorption changes for the ferrous-NO complex monitored at λ = 442 nm as a function of the concentration of added NO using BH4-bound eNOS. ΔOD increased with added NO in the range of 0.001 to 0.03% and then leveled off. The same ΔOD value was obtained varying NO concentrations from 0.1 to 10%. The data fit a sigmoidal curve, which indicated that NO binding reached saturation at about 0.03–0.04% NO. This saturation level of 0.03 to 0.04% corresponds to 0.6 μm NO in solution, a much lower concentration than that of reduced eNOS. However it is unlikely that the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of NO is unperturbed by the presence of eNOS. The protein could modify the NO distribution between liquid and gas phases, depleting NO from the gas phase because of its high affinity for NO. If one assumes that each NO added is transferred to the solution because of this depletion, then the plateau is reached between three and four NO bound per heme (Fig. 1, upper scale) and remains constant within experimental error up to 1000 NO molecules per heme. Fig. 1 also presents the difference maximum, ΔOD 442 nm, as a function of added NO in the gas phase using BH4-depleted eNOS. The data fit a sigmoidal curve with a plateau reached at about 0.2% NO. The comparison between isothermal binding of NO by BH4-depleted eNOS and eNOS containing BH4clearly shows that NO binds more tightly to the latter; the half-saturation is reached at 0.055 and 0.01% NO, respectively. The recombination of diatomic ligands, such as NO, with the heme prosthetic group in proteins generally occurred in non-monoexponential phases. The fast phase of geminate recombination involved the rebinding of NO molecules prior to their escape from the protein into the solvent. This phase generally took place on the submicrosecond time scale and can be coupled to protein dynamics known to occur on such time scales (14Ansari A. Jones C.M. Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5128-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The slower phase involved the recombination of ligands after their escape into the solution. It followed bimolecular kinetics and occurred on the millisecond time scale for the protein and ligand concentrations usually studied. Our experiments probed the faster geminate recombination of NO with the heme, a step contributing to both on and off rates. Excitation of NO-bound eNOS with a laser pulse induced NO dissociation from the heme. A second pulse then allowed to probe the spectral changes associated with NO rebinding to the heme. These spectral changes correspond to a difference between spectra collected at a given time delay, t, after photodissociation. Typical transient spectra are shown in Fig. 2. The spectra recorded within the first few picoseconds included a contribution of the excited state absorption, the decay of which was clearly seen around 460 nm. The spectra obtained at 240 ps and 3 ns presented a maximum at 406 nm and a minimum at 436 nm, with an isosbestic point at 425 nm. These spectral features are characteristic of the reduced unliganded eNOS, because they are also found in the difference equilibrium spectrum between reduced eNOS and NO-bound protein (Fig. 2). Kinetics of NO rebinding to the heme at 1.5% NO are characterized by a non-single exponential behavior including a fast phase occurring in the picosecond regime and a slow phase taking place in the ns time scale (Fig. 2). The transient absorption spectra recorded at 50 ps and 4 ns exhibited the same line shape, with the latter having a smaller amplitude. This implies that one monitored the decay of the same species in two phases. Accordingly, it appeared as a single and largest component in an SVD analysis. At 0.3% NO concentrations, the fit of the kinetics associated with this SVD component yielded three exponential terms, τ1 = (32 ± 9) ps, τ2 = (0.3 ± 0.1) ns, and τ3 = (3.7 ± 0.3) ns, and a non-decaying phase as shown in Fig.3, curves c and d. The kinetic parameters are summarized in TableI.

The recombination kinetics clearly depended on NO concentration below [NO] = 0.3%. Fig. 3 shows that the geminate recombination rate was slower in both the picosecond and nanosecond time ranges at [NO] = 0.02% (curve a) than at [NO] = 0.3% (see curve c and Table I). This lower rate of rebinding resulted in a higher percentage of non-liganded NOS remaining after t = 3 ns. Intermediate kinetics were obtained near saturation, [NO] = 0.1%; see curve b. Kinetics monitored at [NO] = 0.04% are fitted by two exponentials with similar time constants to those obtained at [NO] = 0.02% although the pre-exponential (amplitude) terms differ (Table I). Fig.4 shows that NO rebinding to the heme occurred in a non-single exponential steps characterized by a fast phase occurring in picoseconds and a slow phase taking place in the nanosecond time scale. The kinetics was independent of NO concentration in the range of 0.1 to 10%. The data can be fit by two exponential terms and a non-decaying phase, τ1 = (90 ± 30) ps and τ2 = (1.2 ± 0.3) ns (see TableII). Similar kinetics was also recorded at 0.05% NO and yielded similar lifetimes but had a higher uncertainty because of low signal to noise ratio.Table IIKinetic parameters obtained from BH 4 -absent eNOSNO[NO]/[Fe(II)]2-aMolar ratio of the total NO amount (aqueous and gaseous phases) over the heme amount.τ1A12-bRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited state.τ2A22-bRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited state.A32-bRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited state.2-cAmplitude of the constant component (τ3 ≫ 4 ns).%psns0.0551210.181.20.090.730.110880.141.10.160.700.2201210.081.40.360.561.0100720.201.50.250.55101000660.140.90.130.73Parameters obtained by fitting the kinetics associated with the main SVD component.

This behavior contrasted the clear NO dependence shown in Fig. 3 for BH4-bound eNOS. This difference between BH4-depleted and BH4-bound eNOS occurred at similar NO concentrations. Fig. 4 also presents kinetics of NO recombination to the heme in BH4-bound eNOS. It is clearly seen that the geminate recombination was much faster in the presence of BH4 than in its absence. This contrasts with the lack of effect of BH4 on the geminate rebinding of NO to the ferric eNOS (7Négrerie M. Berka V. Vos M.H. Lieble U. Lambry J.-C. Tsai A.-L. Martin J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24694-24702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, BH4-bound and -depleted eNOS differ in the NO dependence of NO rebinding kinetics. However, the eNOS samples differ in their expression system (from Sf9 and E. coli, respectively). The experiments were thus also performed with BH4-bound eNOS prepared by the E. coli expression system to ensure that the NO dependence of the rebinding kinetics could not be because of some structural changes between the two preparations. The insetof Fig. 3 shows that a much slower kinetics is obtained at 0.02% NO than that recorded at 1.5% NO. Thus, the sample prepared in theE. coli system follows qualitatively the same trend as described previously for the baculovirus expression (Fig. 3) with the NO concentration effect on NO rebinding kinetics observed in the presence of the pterin cofactor but not in its absence of BH4. Our transient absorption experiments probed the recombination kinetics of NO with the heme on a time scale where only intraprotein processes are relevant. The picosecond phase is due to the rebinding of NO that did not escape the heme pocket after photodissociation and is presumably activationless, whereas the nanosecond phase reflects rebinding of ligands that have overcome an energy barrier (7Négrerie M.

Hochstasser R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8982-8986Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recombination of photodissociated NO took place in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale, which was not long enough to allow diffusion of NO molecules from the bulk solution toward the protein interior. Taking the on-rate of NO binding to the ferrous eNOS, k on = 1.1 × 106m−1 · s−1 (16Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), assuming an NO concentration of 0.4 μm at [NO] = 0.02%, there should only be an effect of bulk NO concentration in the time range of hundreds of milliseconds, much slower than the process we were measuring. Hence the NO concentration effect must arise from diffusion and/or transfer processes within the protein. Several hypotheses may explain the dependence of the rebinding kinetics on NO concentration. Three possibilities need to be considered. The first deals with the heterogeneity of the enzyme in terms of BH4 content, the second one has to do with a new non-heme site that binds NO. This site may compete with the heme for NO binding or may modify NO trajectory by steric effects, and in the third hypothesis, there is an NO-dependent regulatory site that may be electronically coupled with the heme via BH4 and thus lower the energy barrier for recombination. First, we have to consider that our BH4-containing sample is actually composed of a heterogeneous population with respect to BH4 content; 60% of the protein contains BH4, and the remaining 40% is depleted of the cofactor. Table I and Table II show that NO rebinding to BH4-depleted heme is slower than that in its presence. Thus, the slower rate at low NO concentration obtained with eNOS containing 60% BH4 could be because of the preferential NO rebinding to BH4-depleted heme. This held true if the affinity of NO for BH4-depleted heme was higher than for BH4-bound protein. However, Fig. 1 shows that the inverse situation occurs; the affinity of NO for BH4-depleted eNOS is lower than for BH4-bound protein. Thus, the heterogeneous population seems unlikely to be the origin of the NO dependence of the kinetics. Second, we discuss the availability of a new NO binding site near the heme as a target for binding. An estimate for the affinity of this site for NO is given by the plot of the apparent half-life time, τ 12 (Fig. 1), as a function of NO concentration in the range 0.02 to 10% (NO concentrations below 0.02% yielded a signal too small to obtain reliable kinetics). An apparentK D for this non-heme site is estimated at [NO] = 0.04% corresponding to four NO per protein compared with that of the heme in the same conditions [NO] = 0.01%, i.e. one NO per protein. The transfer of NO from the non-heme site to the heme may thus be facilitated by its lower affinity for NO compared with that of the reduced heme. Scheme FS1 A assumes that the NO molecules dissociated from the heme by the laser pulse may recombine either to the heme or to the new site. The kinetics of the picosecond rebinding fraction to the heme would become faster in the presence of this site than if the heme was the only recombination site and would introduce a dependence on NO concentration, reflecting the occupancy of the non-heme site. Once this new site is fully saturated with NO, the kinetics became independent of NO concentration, because the dissociated NO has only one target left, the heme. Alternatively, the accommodation of a second NO bound to the non-heme site near the heme may limit the volume in which the released NO can move (the heme pocket) and hence increase the probability of colliding with the heme iron (17Vos M.H. Lipowski G. Lambry J.-C. Martin J.-L. Liebl U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7806-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). NO rebinding to the heme is here purely geminate. However, the present hypothesis implies a close proximity between the heme and the second site. Our data indicate that this site has to be located close enough to the heme to allow such a rebinding to occur within hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds. Considering the reported values for CO and oxygen diffusion coefficients within proteins, ranging between 10−7 and 10−11cm2/s, one can crudely estimate that the distance between the new NO site and the heme should not exceed ∼10 Å (18Marden M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Carrero J. Jameson D.M. Gratton E. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 54: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Such a distance of ∼10 Å may be too large to hinder NO recombination to the heme by steric effects. We now turn to the potential nature of the proposed binding site. One possibility is that NO binds to metal ions such as iron and copper. For instance, Marletta and co-workers (20Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have shown that the inducible and neuronal isoforms of NOS (iNOS and nNOS) can bind one equivalent of non-heme iron per monomer that stimulates the catalytic activity. Based on the well established iron-BH4-coupled hydroxylation, these authors proposed the amino acids Asp-650, His-692, and His-652 (the numbering refers to nNOS), which lie above the heme plane in proximity to the C4a pterin edge, to form the iron binding site in nNOS (20Perry J.M. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11101-11106Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, x-ray and mutation studies failed to reveal metal binding in the vicinity of the C4a position of BH4(4Raman C.S., Li, H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4608-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Other transition metals have been shown to interact with NOS, and in particular Cu2+ and Zn2+ inhibit NOS catalysis through an interaction with the reductase domain (21Persechini A. McMillan K. Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15091-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Perry J.M. Zhao Y. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14070-14076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These metal centers should be irrelevant for our geminate rebinding of NO. Another possibility is that cysteine residues close to the heme and BH4 act as an NO binding site (cysteines constitute one of the most probable NO targets besides metallic ions in the protein). One such residue is Cys-443 located 15 Å from the heme iron, which is probably too far from the heme to constitute the second NO site. Alternatively, this site could be a cysteine located in the reductase domain close to the heme pocket and to the BH4 binding site. Two cysteine residues located in the reductase domain have been suggested to be important for BH4 binding and activity (3Rusche K.M. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 421-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Work along these lines is in progress in our laboratory. The third hypothesis also involves a non-heme NO binding site as a regulatory element of NO evolution rather than a participant in the recombination. It assumes that the presence of this site lowers the activation energy barrier for recombination to the heme from the heme pocket (Scheme FS1 B). The filling of this site with NO progressively lowers the energy barrier for recombination that is truly geminate. Once this site is saturated with NO, the kinetics becomes independent on NO concentration. BH4 rigidifying the heme could be one major reason to lower the energy barrier. To decrease the energy barrier, the new site has to be located close to the BH4 binding site and is probably coupled to BH4 and indirectly to the heme via hydrogen bonds between BH4 and the heme. This would explain why the BH4 cofactor has to be present for an NO concentration dependence on the recombination to exist. The existence of such a coupling is also consistent with BH4 affecting the heme midpoint potential (23Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This coupling is also likely to affect the rebinding kinetics in the hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds range, because it may directly control the heme reactivity. In this hypothesis, the nature of the regulatory site may be, as suggested above, a cysteine residue or BH4 itself (see below). The binding isotherms of NO to BH4-bound and BH4-depleted eNOS are clearly shifted from one another (Fig. 1, inset). This implies a lower affinity of NO for the reduced heme in the absence of the cofactor, possibly because of a larger distance between the iron andl-arginine (24Li H. Raman C.S. Martásek P. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data of Fig. 4 and Table II clearly show the lack of NO dependence in BH4-depleted sample. This holds true for concentration from 0.1 to 10%. Thus, in this case, NO rebinding to the heme is purely geminate without any possible contribution of NO from another site in the protein except the heme. This contrasts with the kinetics obtained in the presence of BH4, in particular at the NO concentration of 0.1% for which the rate of decay is clearly intermediate between that obtained at 0.02 and 0.3 or 10% (Fig. 3). Thus, the existence of the new non-heme site depends on the presence of the pterin cofactor. Furthermore, the recombination is faster in the presence of BH4 than in its absence especially at high NO concentrations (1–10%). This suggests that the cofactor controls NO traffic and/or release from the reduced protein. The presence of the cofactor may tighten the conformation of the reduced heme pocket. In contrast, BH4 does not modify the rate of geminate recombination in the ferric enzyme (7Négrerie M. Berka V. Vos M.H. Lieble U. Lambry J.-C. Tsai A.-L. Martin J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24694-24702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in agreement with the lack of conformational change observed in ferric eNOS with and without pterin by x-ray diffraction (4Raman C.S., Li, H. Martásek P. Král V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Catalysis by NOS is tightly regulated at the molecular level. During catalysis, NO exerts a feedback control on its own synthesis. The neuronal NO-synthase is regulated at the level of the Fe(II)-NO complex whereas in the inducible isoform iNOS, a Fe(III)-NO complex predominates under steady state catalysis (25Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 272: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Abu-Soud H.M., Wu, C. Gosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3777-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27Hurschman A.R. Krebs C. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15689-15696Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In contrast, NO feedback inhibition seems to have a smaller impact on the catalysis of the endothelial isoform (16Abu-Soud H.M. Ichimori K. Presta A. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17349-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that we study. The latter authors suggested that, for this isoform, the rate of electron transfer from the reductase domain to the heme is rate-limiting. Indeed, the electron transfer rate and the catalytic activity are the lowest in eNOS compared with nNOS and iNOS (28Miller R.T. Martásek P. Omura T. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 265: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation studies showed that an autoregulatory loop in the reductase domain of eNOS and nNOS exerts autoinhibition of the electron transfer (29Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Chen P.F. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13155-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the absence of ferrous and ferric nitrosyl complexes under steady state catalysis in the presence ofl-arginine could be related to NO occupancy of the new non-heme site, irrespective of the iron oxidation state of eNOS. In other words, this site may act as an NO “reservoir” or as an entry/exit gate to the heme pocket of eNOS."
