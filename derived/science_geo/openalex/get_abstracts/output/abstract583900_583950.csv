https://openalex.org/W2963658727,"Evolution of cooperation and competition can appear when multiple adaptive agents share a biological, social, or technological niche. In the present work we study how cooperation and competition emerge between autonomous agents that learn by reinforcement while using only their raw visual input as the state representation. In particular, we extend the Deep Q-Learning framework to multiagent environments to investigate the interaction between two learning agents in the well-known video game Pong. By manipulating the classical rewarding scheme of Pong we show how competitive and collaborative behaviors emerge. We also describe the progression from competitive to collaborative behavior when the incentive to cooperate is increased. Finally we show how learning by playing against another adaptive agent, instead of against a hard-wired algorithm, results in more robust strategies. The present work shows that Deep Q-Networks can become a useful tool for studying decentralized learning of multiagent systems coping with high-dimensional environments."
https://openalex.org/W2593878375,"Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics explain the dominance of matter over antimatter in our Universe by neutrinos being their own antiparticles. This would imply the existence of neutrinoless double-β decay, which is an extremely rare lepton-number-violating radioactive decay process whose detection requires the utmost background suppression. Among the programmes that aim to detect this decay, the GERDA Collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double-β decay of 76Ge by operating bare detectors, made of germanium with an enriched 76Ge fraction, in liquid argon. After having completed Phase I of data taking, we have recently launched Phase II. Here we report that in GERDA Phase II we have achieved a background level of approximately 10−3 counts keV−1 kg−1 yr−1. This implies that the experiment is background-free, even when increasing the exposure up to design level. This is achieved by use of an active veto system, superior germanium detector energy resolution and improved background recognition of our new detectors. No signal of neutrinoless double-β decay was found when Phase I and Phase II data were combined, and we deduce a lower-limit half-life of 5.3 × 1025 years at the 90 per cent confidence level. Our half-life sensitivity of 4.0 × 1025 years is competitive with the best experiments that use a substantially larger isotope mass. The potential of an essentially background-free search for neutrinoless double-β decay will facilitate a larger germanium experiment with sensitivity levels that will bring us closer to clarifying whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2604293429,"A massive ancient galaxy with minimal star formation is observed spectroscopically at an epoch when the Universe is less than 2 billion years old, posing a challenge to theories. Deep astronomical surveys have provided evidence for groups of massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshifts, but this poses a problem: theoretical models do not account for galaxies that stopped forming stars so early in the history of the Universe. Detecting such galaxies is an observational challenge owing to their negligible rest-frame ultraviolet emission and the need for extremely deep near-infrared surveys—the evidence has so far consisted entirely of coarsely sampled photometry. Karl Glazebrook et al. report spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at a redshift of 3.717, with a stellar mass of 1.7 × 1011 solar masses. The absorption line spectrum shows no current star-formation, and the age of the galaxy is derived to be nearly half that of the Universe. The authors suggest that the galaxy formed its stars in an extreme and short starburst within the first billion years of cosmic history, implying that our picture of galaxy formation may need an update. Finding massive galaxies that stopped forming stars in the early Universe presents an observational challenge because their rest-frame ultraviolet emission is negligible and they can only be reliably identified by extremely deep near-infrared surveys. These surveys have revealed the presence of massive, quiescent early-type galaxies1,2,3,4,5,6 appearing as early as redshift z ≈ 2, an epoch three billion years after the Big Bang. Their age and formation processes have now been explained by an improved generation of galaxy-formation models7,8,9, in which they form rapidly at z ≈ 3–4, consistent with the typical masses and ages derived from their observations. Deeper surveys have reported evidence for populations of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier times, using coarsely sampled photometry. However, these early, massive, quiescent galaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models7,8,9,10. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one such galaxy at redshift z = 3.717, with a stellar mass of 1.7 × 1011 solar masses. We derive its age to be nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift and the absorption line spectrum shows no current star formation. These observations demonstrate that the galaxy must have formed the majority of its stars quickly, within the first billion years of cosmic history in a short, extreme starburst. This ancestral starburst appears similar to those being found by submillimetre-wavelength surveys11,12,13,14. The early formation of such massive systems implies that our picture of early galaxy assembly requires substantial revision."
https://openalex.org/W2604793339,"This study investigated the role of vection (i.e., a visually induced sense of self-motion), optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), and inadvertent head movements in visually induced motion sickness (VIMS), evoked by yaw rotation of the visual surround. These three elements have all been proposed as contributing factors in VIMS, as they can be linked to different motion sickness theories. However, a full understanding of the role of each factor is still lacking because independent manipulation has proven difficult in the past. We adopted an integrative approach to the problem by obtaining measures of potentially relevant parameters in four experimental conditions and subsequently combining them in a linear mixed regression model. To that end, participants were exposed to visual yaw rotation in four separate sessions. Using a full factorial design, the OKN was manipulated by a fixation target (present/absent), and vection strength by introducing a conflict in the motion direction of the central and peripheral field of view (present/absent). In all conditions, head movements were minimized as much as possible. Measured parameters included vection strength, vection variability, OKN slow phase velocity, OKN frequency, the number of inadvertent head movements, and inadvertent head tilt. Results show that VIMS increases with vection strength, but that this relation varies among participants (R2 = 0.48). Regression parameters for vection variability, head and eye movement parameters were not significant. These results may seem to be in line with the Sensory Conflict theory on motion sickness, but we argue that a more detailed definition of the exact nature of the conflict is required to fully appreciate the relationship between vection and VIMS."
https://openalex.org/W2605304535,"Two independent surveys of PhD students in STEM fields at the University of California, Berkeley, indicate that underrepresented minorities (URMs) publish at significantly lower rates than non-URM males, placing the former at a significant disadvantage as they compete for postdoctoral and faculty positions. Differences as a function of gender reveal a similar, though less consistent, pattern. A conspicuous exception is Berkeley's College of Chemistry, where publication rates are tightly clustered as a function of ethnicity and gender, and where PhD students experience a highly structured program that includes early and systematic involvement in research, as well as clear expectations for publishing. Social science research supports the hypothesis that this more structured environment hastens the successful induction of diverse groups into the high-performance STEM academic track."
https://openalex.org/W2605367565,"The impact of anthropogenic activities on coastal waters is a cause of concern because such activities add to the total suspended sediment (TSS) budget of the coastal waters, which have negative impacts on the coastal ecosystem. Satellite remote sensing provides a powerful tool in monitoring TSS concentration at high spatiotemporal resolution, but coastal managers should be mindful that the satellite-derived TSS concentrations are dependent on the satellite sensor's radiometric properties, atmospheric correction approaches, the spatial resolution and the limitations of specific TSS algorithms. In this study, we investigated the impact of different spatial resolutions of satellite sensor on the quantification of TSS concentration in coastal waters of northern Western Australia. We quantified the TSS product derived from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua, Landsat-8 Operational Land Image (OLI), and WorldView-2 (WV2) at native spatial resolutions of 250 m, 30 m and 2 m respectively and coarser spatial resolution (resampled up to 5 km) to quantify the impact of spatial resolution on the derived TSS product in different turbidity conditions. The results from the study show that in the waters of high turbidity and high spatial variability, the high spatial resolution WV2 sensor reported TSS concentration as high as 160 mg L-1 while the low spatial resolution MODIS-Aqua reported a maximum TSS concentration of 23.6 mg L-1. Degrading the spatial resolution of each satellite sensor for highly spatially variable turbid waters led to variability in the TSS concentrations of 114.46%, 304.68% and 38.2% for WV2, Landsat-8 OLI and MODIS-Aqua respectively. The implications of this work are particularly relevant in the situation of compliance monitoring where operations may be required to restrict TSS concentrations to a pre-defined limit."

However, access to well-defined glycoproteins is always important for both basic research and therapeutic purposes. As a result, there has been a substantial effort to identify and understand the catalytic properties of N-glycosyltransferases, enzymes that install the first glycan on the protein chain. In this study we found that ApNGT, a newly discovered cytoplasmic N-glycosyltransferase from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, has strict selectivity toward the residues around the Asn of N-glycosylation sequon by screening a small library of synthetic peptides. The inherent stringency was subsequently demonstrated to be closely associated with a critical residue (Gln-469) of ApNGT which we propose hinders the access of bulky residues surrounding the occupied Asn into the active site. Site-saturated mutagenesis revealed that the introduction of small hydrophobic residues at the site cannot only weaken the stringency of ApNGT but can also contribute to enormous improvement of glycosylation efficiency against both short peptides and proteins. We then employed the most efficient mutant (Q469A) other than the wild-type ApNGT to produce a homogeneous glycoprotein carrying multiple (up to 10) N-glycans, demonstrating that this construct is a promising biocatalyst for potentially addressing the issue of macroheterogeneity in glycoprotein preparation.

https://openalex.org/W2604525294,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Type D personality and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms of intensive care unit (ICU) nurses and to determine the mediating effect of resilience on this relationship. A cross-sectional survey was performed with 179 ICU nurses from 7 hospitals in Gyeong-Nam province, South Korea. The Type D personality, resilience, and PTSD symptoms of subjects were measured using a self-report questionnaire. The mediating effect was analyzed by a series of hierarchical multiple regressions. A total of 38.6% of the study participants turned out to have Type D personality. The Type D personality was positively correlated with PTSD symptoms, and negatively correlated with resilience. There was a negative correlation between resilience and PTSD symptoms. The indirect effect of Type D personality on PTSD symptoms via resilience (β = .51, p < .001) was smaller than the direct effect (β = .58, p < .001). Based on the above results, it can be concluded that resilience had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between Type D personality and PTSD symptoms of ICU nurses. Further studies need to be done to develop interventions for enhancing resilience in ICU nurses."
https://openalex.org/W2605219678,"The efficiency and type of pathway chosen to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critically influenced by the nucleosome packaging and the chromatin architecture surrounding the DSBs. The Swi/Snf (PBAF and BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes contribute to DNA damage-induced nucleosome remodeling, but the mechanism by which it contributes to this function is poorly understood. Herein, we report how the Baf200 (Arid2) PBAF-defining subunit regulates DSB repair. We used cytological and biochemical approaches to show that Baf200 plays an important function by facilitating homologous recombination-dependent processes, such as recruitment of Rad51 (a key component of homologous recombination) to DSBs, homology-directed repair, and cell survival after DNA damage. Furthermore, we observed that Baf200 and Rad51 are present in the same complex and that this interaction is mediated by C-terminal sequences in both proteins. It has been recognized previously that the interplay between distinct forms of Swi/Snf has profound functional consequences, but we understand little about the composition of complexes formed by PBAF protein subunits. Our biochemical analyses reveal that Baf200 forms at least two distinct complexes. One is a canonical form of PBAF including the Swi/Snf-associated Brg1 catalytic subunit, and the other contains Baf180 but not Brg1. This distinction of PBAF complexes based on their unique composition provides the foundation for future studies on the specific contributions of the PBAF forms to the regulation of DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2605316683,"While sub-Saharan African migrants are the second largest group affected by HIV in Europe, sound HIV prevalence estimates based on representative samples of these heterogeneous communities are lacking. Such data are needed to inform prevention and public health policy.This community-based, cross-sectional study combined oral fluid HIV testing with an electronic behavioral survey. Adopting a two-stage time location sampling HIV prevalence estimates for a representative sample of adult sub-Saharan African migrants in Antwerp, Belgium were obtained. Sample proportions and estimated adjusted population proportions were calculated for all variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis explored factors independently associated with HIV infection.Between December 2013 and October 2014, 744 sub-Saharan African migrants were included (37% women). A substantial proportion was socially, legally and economically vulnerable: 21% were probably of undocumented status, 63% had financial problems in the last year and 9% lacked stable housing. Sexual networks were mostly African and crossed national borders, i.e. sexual encounters during travels within Europa and Africa. Concurrency is common, 34% of those in a stable relationship had a partner on the side in the last year. HIV prevalence was 5.9%(95%CI:3.4%-10.1%) among women and 4.2% (95%CI:1.6%-10.6%) among men. Although high lifetime HIV testing was reported at community level (73%), 65.2% (CI95%:32.4%-88.0%) of sub-Saharan African migrants were possibly undiagnosed. Being 45 years or older, unprotected sex when travelling within Europe in the last year, high intentions to use condoms, being unaware of their last sexual partners' HIV status, recent HIV testing and not having encountered partner violence in the last year were independently associated with HIV infection in multivariable logical regression. In univariable analysis, HIV infection was additionally associated to unemployment.This is the first HIV prevalence study among adult sub-Saharan African migrants resettling in a European city based on a representative sample. HIV prevalence was high and could potentially increase further due to the high number of people with an undiagnosed HIV infection, social vulnerability, high levels of concurrency and mainly African sexual networks. Given this population's mobility, an aligned European combination prevention approach addressing these determinants is urgently needed."

Subsequently, new DNA strands are synthesized with bases complementary to the separate leading and lagging strands. The DNA replication process based on the leading strand is performed continuously by polymerase ε (pol ε), which directly binds to the CMG complex (1Sun J. Shi Y. Georgescu R.E. Yuan Z. Chait B.T.

In contrast, a multiple-step replication process based on the lagging strand is performed requiring primase, polymerase α (pol α), and polymerase δ (pol δ), producing discontinuous Okazaki fragments. During this process, a short (∼10 nucleotides, nt) RNA primer is first synthesized by primase (5Kuchta R.D. Stengel G. Mechanism and evolution of DNA primases.Biochim. Biophys.

In contrast to Ctf4, AND-1 possesses a high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain in its C terminus (14Köhler A. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Franke W.W.

The N-terminal WD40 domain, the following SepB domain, and the HMG domain are connected by two flexible loops with 120 and 170 amino acids. Because the sequences of the SepB domains are highly conserved, the CMG-pol α coupling mechanism of Ctf4 is thought to be universal. Nevertheless, given the fact that human cells possess a larger genome with more complex regulatory mechanisms, the precise functions of AND-1 remain to be elucidated. To investigate the structure-function relationship of AND-1 during CMG-pol α coupling, we studied the structures of its WD40 and SepB domains by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (EM). In addition, we used a biochemical approach to study the interaction between AND-1 and its putative partners, including POLA, Sld5, GINS, and various DNA substrates. We found that AND-1 recruits POLA but not Sld5 or GINS, suggesting a different CMG-pol α coupling mechanism. In addition, the HMG domain of AND-1, which is not present in Ctf4, binds long and damaged DNA substrates suggesting possible roles of AND-1 in DNA repair. AND-1 contains three domains linked by two loops (Fig. 1A). The inter-domain loops of AND-1 are highly flexible, rendering crystallization challenging. We therefore individually purified, crystallized, and determined the structures of the WD40 domain (residues 1–330) and the SepB domain (residues 420–850) (Fig. 1). We determined the structure of the WD40 domain at 1.85 Å resolution using single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method (Table 1). In the structure, seven blades (blades i–vii) formed a ring-like β-propeller, similar to those in the canonical WD40 domain structures (16Smith T.F. Diversity of WD-repeat proteins.Subcell.

As shown in Fig. 1B, blades v and vii contain three β-strands; all other blades in the propeller contain four anti-parallel β-strands. The extended N terminus inserts into blade vii and interacts in an anti-parallel manner with the last C-terminal β-strand, stabilizing the ring-like structure.Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsSe-Met-SepBNative WD40Pt-derivative WD40Data collection BeamlineSSRF BL17USSRF BL17USSRF BL17U Wavelength (Å)0.97920.91770.9177 Space groupF432P43212P43212 Cell parametersa, b, c (Å)249.65, 249.65, 249.6579.90, 79.90, 163.7480.20, 80.20, 165.15α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 90.0090.00, 90.00, 90.0090.00, 90.00, 90.00 Resolution (Å)50.00–2.75 (2.85–2.75)aValues in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell.50–1.85 (1.92–1.85)50.00–2.90 (2.95–2.90) Rsym0.104 (0.693)0.061 (0.644)0.097 (0.720) I/σI28.25 (5.31)30.48 (2.51)22.64 (4.97) Completeness (%)99.9 (100.0)99.5 (94.6)99.8 (100.0) Redundancy19.7 (18.7)7.7 (5.9)15.3 (16.1)Refinement Resolution (Å)50.00–2.7550.00–1.85 Total/free reflections32,164/318245,822/2000 Rwork0.209 (0.316)0.174 (0.247) Rfree0.254 (0.419)0.192 (0.305) NO• atoms33462881 Protein32562501 Ligand/ion00 Water90380 B-factor40.9034.94 Protein41.0932.34 Ligand/ion00 Water33.9752.03 Root mean square deviationsBond length (Å)0.0040.008Bond angles (°)0.710.93 Ramachandran plotFavored (%)97.396.6Allowed (%)2.73.4Outlier (%)0.000.00a Values in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell. Open table in a new tab The structure of the SepB domain was determined at 2.75 Å resolution using a Se-Met-based single wavelength anomalous dispersion method (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1C, the structure of the SepB domain covers residues 420–850 of AND-1. The crystal adopts an F432 space group with one monomer in each asymmetry unit. Our analysis showed that SepB domain contains a WD40 subdomain and a helical subdomain, which is connected by a 10-residue loop. The WD40 structure includes six tandem blades (blades I–VI), forming a ring-shaped structure with a gap between blades I and VI. Similar to those in the reported WD40 domain structures, the blades consist of three or four β-strands. The helical subdomain locates at the lateral bottom of the WD40 subdomain, under blades V and VI. It is composed of five α-helices, α1–5, arranged as a helical bundle, which extend out in an arm-like manner. To explore the functional role of the SepB domain of AND-1, we compared our structure of SepB domain with that of Ctf4 (PDB code 4C8S) using PDBeFold (17Krissinel E. Henrick K. Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Our comparative analysis showed that the overall root mean square deviation of the two structures is 2.25 Å. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, when superposing the two structures, we found that the major differences originate from the flexible loops. Their secondary structural elements exhibit an identity of 88%. The high structural similarity indicates the functions of AND-1 are comparable with those of Ctf4. Trimerization of Ctf4 is currently thought to be essential for cellular functioning (10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S.

A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Similarly, AND-1 has previously been reported to assemble into an oligomeric structure (8Kang Y.H. Farina A. Bermudez V.P. Tappin I. Du F. Galal W.C. Hurwitz J. Interaction between human Ctf4 and the Cdc45/Mcm2–7/GINS (CMG) replicative helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19760-19765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Bermudez V.P.

Chem. 2010; 285: 9493-9505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To identify the oligomeric state of AND-1, we performed size-exclusion chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2A, full-length AND-1(1–1129), WD40 with SepB domains (WD40 + SepB(1–850)), and SepB domain(420–850) are predominantly present in their trimeric form in vitro. In contrast, both the WD40 domain and the HMG region are exclusively present as monomers. These results suggest the AND-1 trimer is mediated by its SepB domain. In our crystal structures, three SepB domain molecules in the cubic cell interact closely with each other, sharing a 3-fold symmetric axis of the F432 space group. As shown in Fig. 2B, the WD40 subdomains of these three SepB molecules stack side-by-side, generating a large clover-like platform. The helical subdomains locate on the bottom of the platform, constructing an equilateral triangle. Using PISA (18Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6768) Google Scholar) analysis, we show that the interface formed by the three SepB molecules is of a size of ∼5400 Å2. Within each SepB molecule, up to 110 residues are involved in the inter-molecular interaction. These residues mainly originate from the WD40 subdomain and participate in the interaction between the β-propellers. However, a small number of these residues contribute to the hydrogen bonds between helical subdomains and adjacent β-propellers. Together, our structure provides the structural basis for AND-1 trimerization. Furthermore, we verified the presence of the trimeric structure of AND-1 using the negative staining EM method (Fig. 2C). We collected 7852 particles in the images and classified the particles into 16 classes (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). In our EM images, the WD40 domain and the SepB domain are clearly visible. However, the 10-kDa HMG domain is too small to be identified. In the center of the EM images, a triangle map fits well with the trimeric crystal structure of the SepB domain. Thus we assigned the stable core in the images with trimeric SepB domains. Subsequently, we assigned the maps surrounding the SepB core to the WD40 domains. The particle numbers of the 16 classes are comparable, suggesting that the WD40 domains move around SepB domains without specific orientations. Together, our structural analysis clearly shows that the basis for AND-1 trimerization is the strong interaction between the SepB domains. This result is similar to that reported for Ctf4 in a previous study (10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S. Matak-Vinković D. Labib K. Costa A. Pellegrini L. A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the replisome of budding yeast, POL1 binds to the SepB domain of Ctf4 using a 13-amino acid helix called the Ctf4-binding motif. An earlier structure of the Ctf4-POL1 complex suggested that the Ctf4-binding motif of POL1 binds to the helical region of the Ctf4 SepB domain (10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S. Matak-Vinković D. Labib K. Costa A. Pellegrini L. A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because both the Ctf4-binding motif and SepB domain are conserved from yeast to human (Fig. 3, A and B), we hypothesized that AND-1 interacts with pol α using a similar manner. To test this, we employed an in vitro pulldown assay. Using sequence alignment, we identified a putative AND-1-binding motif (151–171 residues) of POLA. The AND-1-binding motif was fused with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein at the N terminus. The purified GST-tagged POLA was used as bait to pull down SepB domain protein. As shown in Fig. 3E, the SepB domain specifically interacted with the GST-tagged AND-1-binding motif. To identify the binding surface for POLA in the SepB domain of AND-1, we compared the structures of the SepB domain in AND-1 and Ctf4 (Fig. 3C). In the structure of Ctf4, a semi-enclosed groove between helices H2 and H4 provides binding sites for POL1. Although residues in the helical subdomain of Ctf4 and AND-1 are not completely conserved, the overall root mean square deviation of these two subdomains is only 1.70 Å (Figs. 1E and 3, A and C), suggesting this region is structurally conserved from yeast to human. Therefore, we propose that the anti-parallel helices α2 and α4 of AND-1, corresponding to the helices H2 and H4 in Ctf4, provide the binding surface for the AND-1-binding motif of POLA. To test this assumption, we designed five mutants in α2 and α4, including Ala-770, Cys-773, and Ala-792, which are conserved in Ctf4 and AND-1, as well as Met-766 and Tyr-799, which are unique in AND-1. As shown in Fig. 3D, all these residues locate in the groove, with side chains fully or partially exposed on the protein surface. To change the size of the groove and decrease its hydrophobicity, we replaced both alanine residues with positively charged lysines (A770K and A792K) and the hydrophobic residues with small alanines (M766A, C773A, and Y799A). As shown in Fig. 3E, the binding abilities of M766A, A770K, A792K, and Y799A were almost totally abolished, indicating that the residues in the groove are crucial for POLA recognition. In contrast, C773A still interacted with POLA, probably because it is located within the part of the groove distal to the putative POLA motif (Fig. 3D). Together, these results indicate that the interaction between AND-1 and pol α is conserved from yeast to human. In budding yeast, the interaction between the MCM2–7 helicase and Ctf4 is mediated through the N-terminal helix (1–19 amino acids) of Sld5, one of the GINS subunits (10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S. Matak-Vinković D. Labib K. Costa A. Pellegrini L. A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This helix is structurally analogous to the Ctf4-binding motif in POL1, both of which share the binding grooves in Ctf4. However, this motif is found only in fungi (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S. Matak-Vinković D. Labib K. Costa A. Pellegrini L. A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) but is lacking in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and multicellular organisms, including human (Fig. 4A). To test the interaction between AND-1 and GINS, an in vitro pulldown assay was performed using purified GST-tagged Sld5 protein or maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged GINS complex. Using GST-Sld5 as bait, we were unable to pull down more AND-1 derivatives (WD40, SepB, or SepB + HMG domains) than with GST alone (supplemental Fig. S2). We further tested the interaction between GINS complex and AND-1 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 4B, the GINS complex was pulled down by FLAG-Cdc45 but not by AND-1 derivatives. These results suggest that the interaction between AND-1 and Sld5 is much weaker than that of Ctf4-Sld5 in budding yeast (see Fig. 3D in Ref. 10Simon A.C. Zhou J.C. Perera R.L. van Deursen F. Evrin C. Ivanova M.E. Kilkenny M.L. Renault L. Kjaer S. Matak-Vinković D. Labib K. Costa A. Pellegrini L. A Ctf4 trimer couples the CMG helicase to DNA polymerase α in the eukaryotic replisome.Nature. 2014; 510: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with a previous report showing that the assembly of the human AND-1-GINS complex isolated from insect cells is unstable (8Kang Y.H. Farina A. Bermudez V.P. Tappin I. Du F. Galal W.C. Hurwitz J. Interaction between human Ctf4 and the Cdc45/Mcm2–7/GINS (CMG) replicative helicase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 19760-19765Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assume that other as yet unknown proteins mediate the interaction between CMG and AND-1 in human cells, thus rendering the CMG-pol α coupling mechanism of AND-1 within the replisome different from that of Ctf4. Compared with Ctf4, AND-1 contains a unique HMG domain at its C terminus, a type of DNA-binding module that recognizes a variety of DNA conformations (15Reeves R. Adair J.E. Role of high mobility group (HMG) chromatin proteins in DNA repair.DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 926-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Bustin M. Revised nomenclature for high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the DNA-binding specificity and affinity of the HMG domain, we designed six types of model DNAs, including long-ssDNA (59 nt), long-dsDNA (59 bp), short-ssDNA (24 nt), short-dsDNA (24 bp), 3′-recessed dsDNA, and Holiday junction (HJ) structure (Table 2). Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we found that the HMG domain bound to 3′-recessed dsDNA, long-dsDNA, HJ structure, as well as long-ssDNA fragments. In contrast, the interactions between HMG domain and short DNAs, including single-strand and double-strand DNA fragments were negligible (Fig. 5A). The DNA-binding ability of AND-1 protein was further tested and verified, as shown in Fig. 5B. HMG domain and full-length (FL) AND-1 showed comparable binding ability; in contrast, the WD40 + SepB domain barely interacted with any tested DNAs. The dissociation constant KD of AND-1 and DNAs was further measured (Fig. 5, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S3). The KD values of the HMG domain and four types of DNAs, including long-ssDNA, long-dsDNA, 3′-recessed dsDNA, and HJ, were determined as 1.5 ± 0.8 × 10−6 m, 1.5 ± 0.5 × 10−6 m, 1.8 ± 0.3 × 10−6 m, and 1.6 ± 0.9 × 10−6 m, respectively; the KD values of full-length AND-1 protein and these DNAs were 4.5 ± 1.4 × 10−7 m, 1.0 ± 0.2 × 10−6 m, 4.5 ± 0.6 × 10−7 m, and 4.9 ± 0.9 × 10−7 m, respectively (Fig. 5E). Together, these data suggest that AND-1 is a DNA-binding protein by virtue of possessing an HMG domain.Table 2DNA sequences used in EMSADNA typeSequence (5′–3′)LengthntShort-ss (S-ss)GGCTGGCATGGACTTTCATTTCAGaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.24Short-ds (S-ds)GGCTGGCATGGACTTTCATTTCAGaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.24CTGAAATGAAAGTCCATGCCAGCC24Long-ss (L-ss)GAGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.59Long-ds (L-ds)GAGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.59GGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAAGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCTC593′recessedCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCTTTCCCTGTGCCCTTCGTATACGATGaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.59CCCATCGTATACGAAGGGCACAGGG25HJGAGCTGCCGAATTCTACCAGTGCCTTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCaFAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown.59TGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCATCTGTTGTAATCGTCAAGCTTTATGCCT59GGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAAATGTCCTAGCAAGGCACTGGTAGAATTCGGCAGCTC59GAGGCATAAAGCTTGACGATTACAACAGATGGACATTTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACC59a FAM-labeled oligonucleotides are shown. Open table in a new tab In this report, we reveal the crystal structures of the WD40 N-terminal domain and SepB domain from the human AND-1 protein. To elucidate the role of AND-1 during replication, we analyzed the interactions between AND-1 and its potential protein partners in the replisome. Our results reveal the direct interaction between AND-1 and pol α. However, the interaction between AND-1 and CMG complex remains unclear. Therefore, elucidation of the precise mechanism of AND-1 function during DNA replication awaits further study.

https://openalex.org/W2604364805,"The newly purified extracellular polysaccharides (exopolysaccharides) from Parachlorella kessleri (PCEPS) were evaluated on their antitumor and immunomodulatory effects in cell culture and mouse colon carcinoma peritoneal dissemination model. In two-dimensional cell culture, the PCEPS treatment inhibited cell growth of both murine and human colon carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, the growth of mouse splenocytes (SPLs) and bone marrow cells (BMCs) were stimulated by the treatment with PCEPS. The treatment with PCEPS also increased specific subpopulations of the cells in BMCs: antigen presenting cells (CD19+ B cells, 33D1+ dendritic cells and CD68+ macrophage) and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. In three-dimensional spheroid culture, spheroid growth of CT26 cells co-cultured with HL-60 human neutrophilic promyeloblasts and Jurkat cells (human lymphoblasts), but not THP-1 human monocyte/macrophage was significantly attenuated by PCEPS treatment. In a mouse CT26 colon carcinoma peritoneal dissemination model, intraperitoneal injection of PCEPS (10 mg/kg, twice per week) significantly attenuated the growth of CT26 colon carcinoma in syngeneic mice. The present study suggests that PCEPS inhibits colon carcinoma growth via direct cell growth inhibition and a stimulation of the host antitumor immune responses. Taken together, the current study suggests that exopolysaccharides derived from Parachlorella kessleri contain significant bioactive materials that inhibit colon carcinoma growth."
https://openalex.org/W2605247874,"Ligands binding to polymers regulate polymer functions by changing their physical and chemical properties. This ligand regulation plays a key role in many biological processes. We propose here a model to explain the mechanical, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of the process of binding of small ligands to long biopolymers. These properties can now be measured at the single molecule level using force spectroscopy techniques. Our model performs an effective decomposition of the ligand-polymer system on its covered and uncovered regions, showing that the elastic properties of the ligand-polymer depend explicitly on the ligand coverage of the polymer (i.e., the fraction of the polymer covered by the ligand). The equilibrium coverage that minimizes the free energy of the ligand-polymer system is computed as a function of the applied force. We show how ligands tune the mechanical properties of a polymer, in particular its length and stiffness, in a force dependent manner. In addition, it is shown how ligand binding can be regulated applying mechanical tension on the polymer. Moreover, the binding kinetics study shows that, in the case where the ligand binds and organizes the polymer in different modes, the binding process can present transient shortening or lengthening of the polymer, caused by changes in the relative coverage by the different ligand modes. Our model will be useful to understand ligand-binding regulation of biological processes, such as the metabolism of nucleic acid. In particular, this model allows estimating the coverage fraction and the ligand mode characteristics from the force extension curves of a ligand-polymer system."
https://openalex.org/W2604323966,"Brain development is a complex process regulated by genetic programs and activity-dependent neuronal connectivity. Anesthetics profoundly alter neuronal excitability, and anesthesia during early brain development has been consistently associated with neuroapoptosis, altered synaptogenesis, and persistent behavioral abnormalities in experimental animals. However, the depth, and even more the duration and developmental time point(s) of exposure to anesthesia determine the neuropathological and long-term behavioral consequences of anesthetics. Here, we have investigated adulthood phenotypic changes induced by repeated but brief (30 min) isoflurane anesthesia delivered during two distinct developmental periods in male mice. A set of animals were subjected to anesthesia treatments at postnatal days 7, 8 and 9 (P7-9) when the animals are susceptible to anesthesia-induced neuroapoptosis and reduced synaptogenesis. To control the potential influence of (handling) stress, a separate group of animals underwent repeated maternal separations of similar durations. Another set of animals were exposed to the same treatments at postnatal days 15, 16 and 17 (P15-17), a developmental time period when anesthetics have been shown to increase synaptogenesis. Starting from postnatal week 9 the mouse phenotype was evaluated using a battery of behavioral tests that assess general locomotor activity (home cage activity, open field), learning and memory (water maze) and depression- (saccharin preference, forced swim test), anxiety- (light-dark box, stress-induced hyperthermia) and schizophrenia- (nesting, prepulse inhibition) related endophenotypes. Apart from mild impairment in spatial navigation memory, exposure to anesthesia treatments during P7-9 did not bring obvious behavioral alterations in adult animals. Importantly, maternal separation during the same developmental period produced a very similar phenotype during the water maze. Mice exposed to anesthesia during P15-17 showed mild hyperactivity and risk-taking behavior in adulthood, but were otherwise normal. We conclude that significantly longer administration periods are needed in order for early-life repeated exposures to anesthetics to produce behavioral alterations in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2604617217,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which accounts for the majority of pancreatic cancers, is a lethal disease with few therapeutic options. Genomic profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has identified a complex and heterogeneous landscape. Understanding the molecular characteristics of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma will facilitate the identification of potential therapeutic strategies. We analyzed the gene expression profiles of primary tumors from patients compared to normal pancreas and identified high co-overexpression of core components of the spindle assembly checkpoint, including the protein kinase TTK (also known as MPS-1). We found overexpression of TTK protein in a subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma primary tumors and cell lines. siRNA-mediated depletion or catalytic inhibition of TTK resulted in an aberrant cell cycle profile, multi- and micro-nucleation, induction of apoptosis, and decreased cell proliferation and transformed growth. Selective catalytic inhibition of TTK caused override of the spindle assembly checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, we identified ubiquitin specific peptidase 16 (Usp16), an ubiquitin hydrolase, as a phosphorylation substrate of TTK. Usp16 regulates chromosomal condensation and G2/M progression by deubiquitinating histone H2A and polo-like kinase 1. Phosphomimetic mutants of Usp16 show enhanced proteosomal degradation and may prolong the G2/M transition allowing for correction of replication errors. Taken together, our results suggest a critical role for TTK in preventing aneuploidy-induced cell death in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2604830590,"Over 9 million new active tuberculosis (TB) cases emerge each year from an enormous pool of 2 billion individuals latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.) worldwide. About 3 million new TB cases per year are unaccounted for, and 1.5 million die. TB, however, is generally curable if diagnosed correctly and in a timely manner. The current diagnostic methods for TB, including state-of-the-art molecular tests, have failed in delivering the capacity needed in endemic countries to curtail this ongoing pandemic. Efficient, cost effective and scalable diagnostic approaches are critically needed. We report a multiplex TB serology panel using microbead suspension array containing a combination of 11 M.tb. antigens that demonstrated overall sensitivity of 91% in serum/plasma samples from TB patients confirmed by culture. Group wise sensitivities for sputum smear positive and negative patients were 95%, and 88%, respectively. Specificity of the test was 96% in untreated COPD patients and 91% in general healthy population. The sensitivity of this test is superior to that of the frontline sputum smear test with a comparable specificity (30–70%, and 93–99%, respectively). The multiplex serology test can be performed with scalability from 1 to 360 patients per day, and is amenable to automation for higher (1000s per day) throughput, thus enabling a scalable clinical work flow model for TB endemic countries. Taken together, the above results suggest that well defined antibody profiles in blood, analyzed by an appropriate technology platform, offer a valuable approach to TB diagnostics in endemic countries."
https://openalex.org/W2604160232,"Dominant mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 cause inherited erythromelalgia, a debilitating pain disorder characterized by severe burning pain and redness of the distal extremities. NaV1.7 is preferentially expressed within peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons. Here, we describe a novel NaV1.7 mutation in an 11-year-old male with underdevelopment of the limbs, recurrent attacks of burning pain with erythema, and swelling in his feet and hands. Frequency and duration of the episodes gradually increased with age, and relief by cooling became less effective. The patient's sister had short stature and reported similar complaints of erythema and burning pain, but with less intensity. Genetic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation in NaV1.7 (2567G>C; p.Gly856Arg) in both siblings. The G856R mutation, located within the DII/S4-S5 linker of the channel, substitutes a highly conserved non-polar glycine by a positively charged arginine. Voltage-clamp analysis of G856R currents revealed that the mutation hyperpolarized (−11.2 mV) voltage dependence of activation and slowed deactivation but did not affect fast inactivation, compared with wild-type channels. A mutation of Gly-856 to aspartic acid was previously found in a family with limb pain and limb underdevelopment, and its functional assessment showed hyperpolarized activation, depolarized fast inactivation, and increased ramp current. Structural modeling using the Rosetta computational modeling suite provided structural clues to the divergent effects of the substitution of Gly-856 by arginine and aspartic acid. Although the proexcitatory changes in gating properties of G856R contribute to the pathophysiology of inherited erythromelalgia, the link to limb underdevelopment is not well understood. Dominant mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 cause inherited erythromelalgia, a debilitating pain disorder characterized by severe burning pain and redness of the distal extremities. NaV1.7 is preferentially expressed within peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons. Here, we describe a novel NaV1.7 mutation in an 11-year-old male with underdevelopment of the limbs, recurrent attacks of burning pain with erythema, and swelling in his feet and hands. Frequency and duration of the episodes gradually increased with age, and relief by cooling became less effective. The patient's sister had short stature and reported similar complaints of erythema and burning pain, but with less intensity. Genetic analysis revealed a novel missense mutation in NaV1.7 (2567G>C; p.Gly856Arg) in both siblings.

https://openalex.org/W2604184276,"Electrophysiological signals of cortical activity show a range of possible frequency and amplitude modulations, both within and across regions, collectively known as cross-frequency coupling. To investigate whether these modulations could be considered as manifestations of the same underlying mechanism, we developed a neural mass model. The model provides five out of the theoretically proposed six different coupling types. Within model components, slow and fast activity engage in phase-frequency coupling in conditions of low ambient noise level and with high noise level engage in phase-amplitude coupling. Between model components, these couplings can be coordinated via slow activity, giving rise to more complex modulations. The model, thus, provides a coherent account of cross-frequency coupling, both within and between components, with which regional and cross-regional frequency and amplitude modulations could be addressed."

The coregulator hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is required for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of some genes but not others and blocks the regulation of a third gene set by inhibiting GR binding. How Hic-5 exerts these gene-specific effects and specifically how it blocks GR binding to some genes but not others is unclear. Here we show that site-specific blocking of GR binding is due to gene-specific requirements for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. By depletion of 11 different chromatin remodelers, we found that ATPases chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 9 (CHD9) and Brahma homologue (BRM, a product of the SMARCA2 gene) are required for GC-regulated expression of the blocked genes but not for other GC-regulated genes. Furthermore, CHD9 and BRM were required for GR occupancy and chromatin remodeling at GR-binding regions associated with blocked genes but not at GR-binding regions associated with other GC-regulated genes. Hic-5 selectively inhibits GR interaction with CHD9 and BRM, thereby blocking chromatin remodeling and robust GR binding at GR-binding sites associated with blocked genes. Thus, Hic-5 regulates GR binding site selection by a novel mechanism, exploiting gene-specific requirements for chromatin remodeling enzymes to selectively influence DNA occupancy and gene regulation by a transcription factor.

https://openalex.org/W2604886776,"The aim of the present study evaluated the effect and process of the ToyBox-intervention on proxy-reported sedentary behaviours in 4- to 6-year-old preschoolers from six European countries.In total, 2434 preschoolers' parents/primary caregivers (mean age: 4.7±0.4 years, 52.2% boys) filled out a questionnaire, assessing preschoolers' sedentary behaviours (TV/DVD/video viewing, computer/video games use and quiet play) on weekdays and weekend days. Multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted to measure the intervention effects. Additionally, process evaluation data were included to better understand the intervention effects.Positive intervention effects were found for computer/video games use. In the total sample, the intervention group showed a smaller increase in computer/video games use on weekdays (ß = -3.40, p = 0.06; intervention: +5.48 min/day, control: +8.89 min/day) and on weekend days (ß = -5.97, p = 0.05; intervention: +9.46 min/day, control: +15.43 min/day) from baseline to follow-up, compared to the control group. Country-specific analyses showed similar effects in Belgium and Bulgaria, while no significant intervention effects were found in the other countries. Process evaluation data showed relatively low teachers' and low parents' process evaluation scores for the sedentary behaviour component of the intervention (mean: 15.6/24, range: 2.5-23.5 and mean: 8.7/17, range: 0-17, respectively). Higher parents' process evaluation scores were related to a larger intervention effect, but higher teachers' process evaluation scores were not.The ToyBox-intervention had a small, positive effect on European preschoolers' computer/video games use on both weekdays and weekend days, but not on TV/DVD/video viewing or quiet play. The lack of larger effects can possibly be due to the fact that parents were only passively involved in the intervention and to the fact that the intervention was too demanding for the teachers. Future interventions targeting preschoolers' behaviours should involve parents more actively in both the development and the implementation of the intervention and, when involving schools, less demanding activities for teachers should be developed.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02116296."
https://openalex.org/W2604377373,"This study evaluates the accuracy and transferability of Bayesian case detection systems (BCD) that use clinical notes from emergency department (ED) to detect influenza cases.A BCD uses natural language processing (NLP) to infer the presence or absence of clinical findings from ED notes, which are fed into a Bayesain network classifier (BN) to infer patients' diagnoses. We developed BCDs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (BCDUPMC) and Intermountain Healthcare in Utah (BCDIH). At each site, we manually built a rule-based NLP and trained a Bayesain network classifier from over 40,000 ED encounters between Jan. 2008 and May. 2010 using feature selection, machine learning, and expert debiasing approach. Transferability of a BCD in this study may be impacted by seven factors: development (source) institution, development parser, application (target) institution, application parser, NLP transfer, BN transfer, and classification task. We employed an ANOVA analysis to study their impacts on BCD performance.Both BCDs discriminated well between influenza and non-influenza on local test cases (AUCs > 0.92). When tested for transferability using the other institution's cases, BCDUPMC discriminations declined minimally (AUC decreased from 0.95 to 0.94, p<0.01), and BCDIH discriminations declined more (from 0.93 to 0.87, p<0.0001). We attributed the BCDIH decline to the lower recall of the IH parser on UPMC notes. The ANOVA analysis showed five significant factors: development parser, application institution, application parser, BN transfer, and classification task.We demonstrated high influenza case detection performance in two large healthcare systems in two geographically separated regions, providing evidentiary support for the use of automated case detection from routinely collected electronic clinical notes in national influenza surveillance. The transferability could be improved by training Bayesian network classifier locally and increasing the accuracy of the NLP parser."
https://openalex.org/W2604993250,"Mitochondria are essential, dynamic organelles that respond to a number of stressors with changes in morphology that are linked to several mitochondrial functions, though the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We show that the levels of the regulatory GTPase ARL2 and its GAP, ELMOD2, are specifically increased at mitochondria in immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts deleted for Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), but not MFN1. Elevated ARL2 and ELMOD2 in MEFs deleted for MFN2 could be reversed by re-introduction of MFN2, but only when the mitochondrial fragmentation in these MEFs was also reversed, demonstrating that reversal of elevated ARL2 and ELMOD2 requires the fusogenic activity of MFN2. Other stressors with links to mitochondrial morphology were investigated and several, including glucose or serum deprivation, also caused increases in ARL2 and ELMOD2. In contrast, a number of pharmacological inhibitors of energy metabolism caused increases in ARL2 without affecting ELMOD2 levels. Together we interpret these data as evidence of two ARL2-sensitive pathways in mitochondria, one affecting ATP levels that is independent of ELMOD2 and the other leading to mitochondrial fusion involving MFN2 that does involve ELMOD2."

We found that human GIMAP6 is expressed primarily in T cell lines. By sorting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and performing quantitative RT-PCR, GIMAP6 was found to be expressed in CD3+ cells. In Jurkat cells that had been knocked down for GIMAP6, treatment with hydrogen peroxide, FasL, or okadaic acid significantly increased cell death/apoptosis. Exogenous expression of GMAP6 protected Huh-7 cells from apoptosis, suggesting that GIMAP6 is an anti-apoptotic protein. Furthermore, knockdown of GIMAP6 not only rendered Jurkat cells sensitive to apoptosis but also accelerated T cell activation under phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin treatment conditions. Using this experimental system, we also observed a down-regulation of p65 phosphorylation (Ser-536) in GIMAP6 knockdown cells, indicating that GIMAP6 might display anti-apoptotic function through NF-κB activation. The conclusion from the study on cultured T cells was corroborated by the analysis of primary CD3+ T cells, showing that specific knockdown of GIMAP6 led to enhancement of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-mediated activation signals. To characterize the biochemical properties of GIMAP6, we purified the recombinant GIMAP6 to homogeneity and revealed that GIMAP6 had ATPase as well as GTPase activity. We further demonstrated that the hydrolysis activity of GIMAP6 was not essential for its anti-apoptotic function in Huh-7 cells.

Interestingly, hypomorphic Pcbp1 mutant mice displayed defects in muscle growth due to defects in the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts and muscle satellite cells, in addition to a slow to fast myofibril switch. Moreover, Pcbp1 modulated the processing of muscle-enriched miR-1, miR-133, and miR-206 by physically interacting with argonaute 2 (AGO2) and other miRNA pathway components.

On December 9th, 2015, Mexico became the first country for which the dengue vaccine was approved for use. In anticipation of a vaccine rollout, analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the dengue vaccination program that quantifies the dynamics of disease transmission is essential.We developed a dynamic transmission model of dengue in Yucatán, Mexico and its proposed vaccination program to incorporate herd immunity into our analysis of cost-effectiveness analysis. Our model also incorporates important characteristics of dengue epidemiology, such as clinical cross-immunity and susceptibility enhancement upon secondary infection. Using our model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of an imperfect dengue vaccine in Yucatán, Mexico.Our study indicates that a dengue vaccination program would prevent 90% of cases of symptomatic DF incidence as well as 90% of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) incidence and dengue-related deaths annually. We conclude that a dengue vaccine program in Yucatán, Mexico would be very cost-effective as long as the vaccination cost per individual is less than $140 and $214 from health care and societal perspectives, respectively. Furthermore, at an exemplary vaccination cost of $250 USD per individual on average, dengue vaccination is likely to be cost-effective 43% and 88% of the time from health care and societal perspectives, respectively."

This study aimed to investigate the putative association between the humoral immune response against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) and prevalence and extension of CVPC in 1) experimentally infected pigs, 2) slaughtered pigs and 3) sequentially necropsied pigs in a longitudinal study. CVPC was scored by means of the European Pharmacopoeia recommended methodology. Specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were assessed in serum. In addition, mucosal IgG and IgA antibodies were analyzed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from experimentally challenged pigs. The systemic humoral immune response in experimentally infected pigs was delayed in onset whereas humoral respiratory mucosal immune response appeared more rapidly but declined earlier. Although low, BALF IgG antibodies showed the highest correlation with CVPC scores (r = 0.49, p<0.05). In slaughter-aged pigs, both percentage of lungs with CVPC and mean lung lesion score were significantly higher in M. hyopneumoniae seropositive farms compared to the seronegative ones (p<0.001). Similarly, seropositive sequentially necropsied pigs showed more severe CVPC than seronegative ones. Overall, mean serological values might help to forecast prevalence and severity of EP-like lung lesions using a population based approach. Remarkably, the specific systemic humoral immune response was found to be predominated by the IgG2 subclass, suggesting a dominant Th1-mediated immune response to M. hyopneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2605104092,"Shortly after its introduction into the Hawaiian Islands around 1895, the polyphagous, invasive fruit fly Bactrocera (Zeugodacus) cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) was provided the opportunity to expand its host range to include a novel host, papaya (Carica papaya). It has been documented that female B. cucurbitae rely strongly on vision to locate host fruit. Given that the papaya fruit is visually conspicuous in the papaya agro-ecosystem, we hypothesized that female B. cucurbitae used vision as the main sensory modality to find and exploit the novel host fruit. Using a comparative approach that involved a series of studies under natural and semi-natural conditions in Hawaii, we assessed the ability of female B. cucurbitae to locate and oviposit in papaya fruit using the sensory modalities of olfaction and vision alone and also in combination. The results of these studies demonstrate that, under a variety of conditions, volatiles emitted by the novel host do not positively stimulate the behavior of the herbivore. Rather, vision seems to be the main mechanism driving the exploitation of the novel host. Volatiles emitted by the novel host papaya fruit did not contribute in any way to the visual response of females. Our findings highlight the remarkable role of vision in the host-location process of B. cucurbitae and provide empirical evidence for this sensory modality as a potential mechanism involved in host range expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2605123088,"μ-Opioid receptor (MOR) agonists are often used to treat severe pain but can result in adverse side effects. To circumvent systemic side effects, targeting peripheral opioid receptors is an attractive alternative treatment for severe pain. Activation of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) produces similar analgesia with reduced side effects. However, until primed by inflammation, peripheral DOR is analgesically incompetent, raising interest in the mechanism. We recently identified a novel role for G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) that renders DOR analgesically incompetent at the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism that maintains constitutive GRK2 association with DOR is unknown. Protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser-685 targets it to the plasma membrane. Protein kinase A-anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP), residing at the plasma membrane in neurons, scaffolds PKA to target proteins to mediate downstream signal. Therefore, we sought to determine whether GRK2-mediated DOR desensitization is directed by PKA via AKAP scaffolding. Membrane fractions from cultured rat sensory neurons following AKAP siRNA transfection and from AKAP-knock-out mice had less PKA activity, GRK2 Ser-685 phosphorylation, and GRK2 plasma membrane targeting than controls. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that GRK2 Ser-685 phosphorylation drives the association of GRK2 with plasma membrane-associated DOR. Moreover, overexpression studies with AKAP mutants indicated that impaired AKAP-mediated PKA scaffolding significantly reduces DOR-GRK2 association at the plasma membrane and consequently increases DOR activity in sensory neurons without a priming event.

In the periphery, immunohistochemical analysis of intact and cultured rat trigeminal ganglia (TG) reveal neuronal coexpression of AKAP and PKA RII (23Jeske N.A. Diogenes A. Ruparel N.B.

Complementary biochemical analysis in cultured TG lysates reveals that AKAP co-immunoprecipitates with PKA RII. In immortalized cells, AKAP scaffolding of PKA drives GRK2 to the plasma membrane, where it modulates G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (24Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W.

In the present study, we investigate the potential role of AKAP scaffolding of PKA in constitutive GRK2 maintenance of DOR incompetence in peripheral sensory neurons. Using imaging, biochemical, molecular, and functional techniques, we sought to determine whether AKAP scaffolding of PKA sustains GKR2-DOR association and functional receptor incompetence in the periphery. Such a mechanism could be used to identify novel drugs that disrupt these protein-protein interactions for use in combination therapy with peripherally restricted DOR agonists. This approach would be expected to enhance DOR-mediated analgesia in non-inflammatory pain patients with a reduced likelihood of systemic side effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that AKAP serves to anchor PKA RII to the plasma membrane (19Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S.

In the periphery, immunohistochemical analysis of intact and cultured rat TG revealed neuronal co-expression of AKAP and PKA RII (23Jeske N.A. Diogenes A. Ruparel N.B. Fehrenbacher J.C. Henry M. Akopian A.N. Hargreaves K.M. A-kinase anchoring protein mediates TRPV1 thermal hyperalgesia through phosphorylation of TRPV1.Pain. 2008; 138: 604-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether AKAP plays a role in membrane localization of PKA RII in the periphery, qualitative confocal microscopy was utilized to examine PKA RII distribution across cultured TG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from AKAP wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice (Fig. 1A). PKA RII is well-distributed throughout the TG and DRG of WT mice and, to a lesser extent, KO mice. Although whole-cell PKA RII densitometry across groups does not significantly differ, PKA RII is significantly increased at the plasma membrane of WT TG and DRG compared with KO neurons (Fig. 1B, (whole-cell) interaction, p = 0.8599; (whole-cell) WT versus KO, p = 0.6133; (whole-cell) TG versus DRG, p = 0.0501; ((plasma membrane; PM) interaction, p = 0.1769; (PM) WT versus KO, p = 0.0527; (PM) TG versus DRG, p = 0.1000; n = 41–77; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). This interaction was confirmed when plasma membrane PKA RII was compared with total PKA RII for each group (Fig. 1C, interaction, p = 0.0271; TG versus DRG, p = 0.0063; WT versus KO, p < 0.0001; n = 41–77; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). Compared with WT, the percentage of PKA RII at the plasma membrane in KO neurons is reduced by 58.27 ± 9.34% in TG and 42.36 ± 14.95% in DRG. These data identify that AKAP supports PKA localization at the plasma membrane in peripheral sensory neurons. We next employed an in vitro assay to assess kinase activity in membrane fractions of intact or cultured TG to determine the role of AKAP in local PKA activity at the plasma membrane in mice and rats. Compared with WT mice, PKA activity in membrane lysates of AKAP KO mice is reduced by 50.24 ± 12.31% (Fig. 1D, p = 0.0009, n = 3 independent trials in triplicate, unpaired Student's t test). As previously reported, AKAP siRNA treatment to cultured rat TG does not change PKA activity of whole-cell lysates as measured by Western blotting (WB) (23Jeske N.A. Diogenes A. Ruparel N.B. Fehrenbacher J.C. Henry M. Akopian A.N. Hargreaves K.M. A-kinase anchoring protein mediates TRPV1 thermal hyperalgesia through phosphorylation of TRPV1.Pain. 2008; 138: 604-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, transfection of rat TG cultures with AKAP siRNA significantly reduces PKA activity at the plasma membrane by 33.73 ± 9.79% compared with mock treatment (Fig. 1E, p = 0.0033, n = 3 independent trials in triplicate, unpaired Student's t test). Collectively, these data suggest that AKAP serves to anchor active PKA to the plasma membrane in peripheral sensory neurons of both mice and rats. In immortalized cells, PKA activation stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins, including the direct phosphorylation GRK2 at Ser-685 (24Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Regulation of membrane targeting of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 by protein kinase A and its anchoring protein AKAP79.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although PKA phosphorylation of GRK2 does not enhance GRK2 catalytic activity, it facilitates GRK2 modulation of GPCRs by targeting GRK2 to the plasma membrane. We sought to determine whether this mechanism occurs in peripheral sensory neurons. To determine whether PKA activation leads to direct PKA phosphorylation of GRK2, we utilized a phosphorylation site-specific antibody for GRK2 at Ser-685 (Fig. 2, A and B). Serum-starved rat TG cultures were stimulated with 8-Br-cAMP (10 μm; 5 min), followed by homogenization and crude fractionation. Next, GRK2 was isolated from cytosol and membrane lysates by immunoprecipitation. Stimulation by 8-Br-cAMP significantly increases PKA-dependent GRK2 phosphorylation by 278.00 ± 80.42% in the cytosol, whereas PKA stimulation resulted in a trend toward increased PKA-dependent phosphorylation by 147.80 ± 58.43% at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and B; p = 0.0259 (A) and p = 0.0647 (B), n = 3 independent trials, unpaired student's t test). Compared with vehicle-treated cells, 8-Br-cAMP treatment also resulted in a trend toward increased GRK2 translocation to the plasma membrane by 61.60 ± 22.35% (Fig. 2C, p = 0.0511, n = 3 independent trials, unpaired Student's t test). This experiment recapitulates what was found in immortalized cells and reveals that stimulation of PKA enhances PKA-dependent phosphorylation in the cytosol and, albeit just beyond significance, may have similar effects at the plasma membrane as a result of translocation of GRK2 in rat primary sensory neurons. AKAP scaffolding of PKA indirectly regulates GRK2 membrane translocation in immortalized cells, which requires PKA to be tethered to the plasma membrane (24Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Regulation of membrane targeting of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 by protein kinase A and its anchoring protein AKAP79.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In cultured rat TG lysates, that AKAP co-immunoprecipitates with PKA RII (23Jeske N.A. Diogenes A. Ruparel N.B. Fehrenbacher J.C. Henry M. Akopian A.N. Hargreaves K.M. A-kinase anchoring protein mediates TRPV1 thermal hyperalgesia through phosphorylation of TRPV1.Pain. 2008; 138: 604-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, it has yet to be determined whether AKAP can indirectly regulate PKA-dependent phosphorylation and translocation of GRK2 in primary sensory neurons. For this experiment, we harvested and fractionated serum-starved rat TG cultures that had been transfected either in mock fashion or with AKAP siRNA. Knockdown of AKAP did not reduce PKA-dependent GRK2 phosphorylation in the cytosol (Fig. 2D, p = 0.3292, n = 3 independent trials, unpaired Student's t test). However, AKAP knockdown significantly reduces membrane GRK2 phosphorylation at Ser-685 by 39.32 ± 15.48% and is accompanied by a reduction in GRK2 membrane targeting by 44.22 ± 18.71% (Fig. 2, E and F; p = 0.0441 (E) and p = 0.0560 (F), n = 3 independent trials, unpaired Student's t test). Similarly, crude membrane TG lysates from AKAP KO mice have 31.10 ± 9.47% less PKA-dependent GRK2 phosphorylation than WT littermates (Fig. 2G, p = 0.0304, n = 3 independent trials, unpaired Student's t test). Importantly, GRK2 targeting to the plasma membrane in AKAP KO TG is significantly reduced by 26.75 ± 9.54% compared with WT littermates (Fig. 2H, p = 0.0485, n = 3 independent trials, unpaired Student's t test). These experiments agree with the aforementioned study in immortalized cells and demonstrate that AKAP expression is crucial to constitutive PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GRK2 targeted to the membrane in rat peripheral sensory neurons. Under non-inflammatory conditions, DOR is chronically bound to GRK2, which renders the receptor dormant or unresponsive to agonist stimulation in peripheral sensory neurons (11Brackley A.D. Gomez R. Akopian A.N. Henry M.A. Jeske N.A. GRK2 constitutively governs peripheral δ opioid receptor activity.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2686-2698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In immortalized cells, phosphorylation by PKA facilitates GRK2 translocation to the plasma membrane to negatively modulate GPCR signaling (24Cong M. Perry S.J. Lin F.T. Fraser I.D. Hu L.A. Chen W. Pitcher J.A. Scott J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Regulation of membrane targeting of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 by protein kinase A and its anchoring protein AKAP79.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15192-15199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Given that PKA-dependent phosphorylation dictates plasma membrane translocation of GRK2 (Fig. 2), we hypothesized that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GRK2 may underlie the constitutive association between DOR and GRK2 at the plasma membrane in primary sensory neurons. To test this, we utilized site-directed mutagenesis. Because site-specific mutants were used rather than a dominant-negative mutant that would antagonize wild-type GRK2, the abundant native kinase was first knocked down with previously validated GRK2 siRNA (11Brackley A.D. Gomez R. Akopian A.N. Henry M.A. Jeske N.A. GRK2 constitutively governs peripheral δ opioid receptor activity.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2686-2698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (75.9 ± 1.8 and 78.8 ± 1.5% endogenous GRK2 reduction for GRK2 siRNA and FITC-GRK2 siRNA, respectively). Following knockdown of endogenous GRK2, we nucleofected either empty vector, wild-type GRK2, GRK2-S685D (phosphomimetic), or GRK2-S685G (phosphodeficient) cDNA into TG cultures. Following overnight serum starvation, cells were harvested, fractionated, and processed for co-immunoprecipitation studies. Following GRK2 silencing and empty vector introduction, a small amount of native GRK2 co-immunoprecipitates with plasma membrane DOR. When wild-type GRK2 is reconstituted, constitutive GRK2 association with DOR increases to 149.78 ± 61.52% above levels in cells nucleofected with empty vector. Introduction of the phosphomimetic mutant, GRK2-S685D, yields a comparable 154.52 ± 34.23% increase in GRK2 that co-immunoprecipitates with DOR at the plasma membrane. In contrast, introduction of the phosphodeficient mutant, GRK2-S685G, produced a small, non-significant increase of 33.90 ± 2.96% above levels in GRK2-silenced TG nucleofected with empty vector (Fig. 3A; *, p ≤ 0.05; ANOVA summary, p = 0.0111; n = 4 independent trials; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). These data demonstrate that in peripheral sensory neurons, PKA phosphorylation of GRK2 drives the constitutive association between DOR and GRK2 at the plasma membrane. To build on this, we next carried out a functional Ca2+ imaging assay in peripheral sensory neurons to determine whether PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GRK2 governs DOR incompetence. We measured opioid inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) elicited by KCl-evoked Ca2+ transients in cultured sensory neurons, which is a validated method that has been used by multiple groups to quantify DOR activity in a heterogeneous neuronal population (10Pettinger L. Gigout S. Linley J.E. Gamper N. Bradykinin controls pool size of sensory neurons expressing functional δ-opioid receptors.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10762-10771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Brackley A.D. Gomez R. Akopian A.N. Henry M.A. Jeske N.A.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1744-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast to patch-clamp electrophysiology, this method circumvents inevitable user bias in determining whether to include a cell that does not respond to a DOR agonist due to lack of receptor expression versus lack of functional receptor competence. Furthermore, it avoids the limitations of requiring gene-targeted receptor-fusion protein introduction into cells that do not typically express DOR, which carries with it potential changes to normal receptor activity, interaction partners, and/or biochemistry. We previously reported that small to medium capsaicin (CAP; 1 μm)-sensitive DRG neurons transfected with FITC-GRK2 siRNA produce significant DOR-mediated inhibition of VGCCs compared with mock-treated cells that have little to no DOR activity in the presence of a DOR agonist (11Brackley A.D.

GRK2 constitutively governs peripheral δ opioid receptor activity.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 2686-2698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test whether PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GRK2 underlies functional DOR incompetence, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown of GRK2 followed by co-nucleofection of GFP with empty vector, wild-type GRK2, GRK2-S685D, or GRK2-S685G cDNA. Recapitulating published population findings in primary cultures, GFP-positive CAP-sensitive DRG transfected with FITC-GRK2 siRNA and empty vector produce a robust response to the DOR agonist [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE; 1 μm), which inhibits KCl (50 mm)-evoked Ca2+ transients by 28.10 ± 4.23% in CAP-sensitive DRG (Fig. 3, B and C). Reintroduction of wild-type GRK2 or nucleofection of GRK2-S685D cDNA similarly antagonizes DPDPE inhibition of KCl-evoked Ca2+ transients to 5.48 ± 2.74 and 3.96 ± 1.87%, respectively. However, nucleofection of GRK2-S685G cDNA following GRK2 knockdown results in 25.18 ± 2.92% DPDPE inhibition of KCl-evoked Ca2+ transients, similar to DRG transfected with FITC-GRK2 siRNA and empty vector cDNA (Fig. 3, B and C; ***, p < 0.005 for GRK2 and GRK2-S685D compared with both empty vector and GRK2-S685G; ANOVA summary, p < 0.0001; n = 29–33 DRG/group; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). Taken together, data presented herein identify that Ser-685 is an important site for GRK2 maintenance of functional DOR incompetence in primary sensory neurons. Under basal conditions, neuronal AKAP interacts with PKA to promote basal phosphorylation of target proteins and receptors (28Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D.

We used an information sampling task to assess how much evidence participants gather before making a decision. Performance was compared to the results of 21 healthy controls.All patients with and without augmentation gathered less information than healthy controls before making a decision (p<0.001), but there was no difference between the two patient groups (p = 1.0). Furthermore, both patient groups made more irrational decisions (e.g. decisions against the evidence they had at the time) than healthy controls (p≤0.002). In addition, RLS patients with augmentation made significantly more irrational decisions than RLS patients without augmentation (p = 0.037) and controls (p<0.001).Our results show that RLS patients treated with dopaminergic drugs, regardless of having augmentation or not, jumped to conclusions and decided significantly more often against the evidence they had at the time of their decision. However, those with augmentation performed worse than all other groups and made more often irrational decisions, a phenomenon which is also common in patients with substance abuse or behavioural addictions. Thus, jumping to conclusions and deciding with a higher degree of uncertainty as well as irrational decision making is more common in RLS patients treated with dopaminergic medication particularly in those with augmentation."

By changing two amino acids (S305R,N307D), we produced a specific receptor-recognition motif (Arg-Gly-Asp; called RGD) on the surface of the RHDV capsid protein. mRHDV was recognized by the intrinsic membrane receptor (integrin) of the RK-13 cells, which then gained entry and proliferated as well as imparted apparent cytopathic effects. After 20 passages, the titers of RHDV reached 1 × 104.3 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml at 72 h. Furthermore, mRHDV-infected rabbits showed typical rabbit plague symptoms and died within 48–72 h. After immunization with inactivated mRHDV, the rabbits survived wild-type RHDV infection, indicating that mRHDV could be a candidate virus strain for producing a vaccine against RHDV infection. In summary, this study offers a novel strategy for overcoming the challenges of proliferating RHDV in vitro.

Viruses are the major pathogens threatening human health.

The VP1 protein of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a protein containing an RGD site with cell attachment activity. The interaction of VP1 with cells is important because VP1 is the capsid protein of FMDV that mediates the virus internalization into cells, thereby initiating the infection process (23Neff S. Sá-Carvalho D. Rieder E. Mason P.W. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Baxt B. Foot-and-mouth disease virus virulent for cattle utilizes the integrin αvβ3 as its receptor.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3587-3594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these established facts, we hypothesize that the insertion of an RGD motif at the appropriate site of a mutated RHDV capsid protein for recognition by the natural receptors (integrins) expressed on the surface of host cells will allow its internalization and replication in host cells. Recently, the crystal structures of the S (shell) and P (protrusion) domains of RHDV VP60 have been revealed, and seven regions of high variation were also mapped onto the surface of the P2 subdomain (24Wang X. Xu F. Liu J. Gao B. Liu Y. Zhai Y. Ma J. Zhang K. Baker T.S. Schulten K. Zheng D. Pang H. Sun F. Atomic model of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus by cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003132Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), which then served as the theoretical basis of our hypothesis. Here, we report a novel strategy for constructing an RHDV mutant that could be recognized by host cells and grow well in RK-13 cells. The rescued RHDV mutant not only showed similar biological characteristics to natural RHDV but also exhibited similar immunogenicity as the parent virus. The overall strategy for the construction of the RHDV replicon is outlined in Fig. 1. In our previous study, a full-length cDNA clone of RHDV was constructed (25Liu G. Zhang Y. Ni Z. Yun T. Sheng Z. Liang H. Hua J. Li S. Du Q. Chen J. Recovery of infectious rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus from rabbits after direct inoculation with in vitro-transcribed RNA.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6597-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); the replicon was driven by the T7 promoter, and the core sequence of hepatitis delta virus ribozyme was placed immediately downstream of the viral poly(A) tract to ensure that the final transcripts had the correct 3′-end. To introduce a recognition site for integrins within the capsid protein of RHDV, two amino acids were mutated (S305R,N307D) through site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the cDNA fragment containing the RGD sequence was inserted to displace the corresponding region (PmlI-to-ClaI) of pRHDV, and the final plasmid was named pmRHDV. Subsequently, the accuracy of the resulting pmRHDV plasmid was confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 1D). Transfected RK-13 cells that harbored the mutant RHDV exhibited cytopathic effects (CPEs) at 24 h post-transfection, which became more prominent at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2A). Antigen generation was subsequently confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) as well as by Western blot assay using a VP60-specific antibody (Fig. 2, B and C). At 24 h post-transfection, the major capsid protein VP60 was clearly detected in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with pmRHDV, and the expression quantity reached its peak at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the rescued virus originated from the pmRHDV plasmid, after 20 passages in RK-13 cells, the viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR following by sequencing. The results showed that the target gene was not only present (Fig. 2D) but also contained the mutated RGD site (Fig. 2E). After 20 passages of the RK-13 cells, mRHDV titers were determined by using the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), which was 1 × 102 TCID50/ml at 24 h.p.i.; after 48 h, the proliferation speed of mRHDV increased with a titer of 1 × 103 TCID50/ml. Replication peaked at about 72 h (1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml), which was followed by a gradual decrease in mRHDV titers (Fig. 3A). Electron microscopic observation of mRHDV particles negatively stained with phosphotungstate indicated that the mRHDV viral particles had a diameter of about 35 nm, which is similar to the wild-type strain (Fig. 3B). These results also demonstrate that we had successfully rescued the mRHDV mutant strain, and it was stably proliferating in RK-13 cells. The mRHDV mutant strain has been submitted to the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC) for preservation (Preservation Number V201501). After infecting with the mRHDV strain, 8-week-old rabbits exhibited classic symptoms of RHDV (JX/CHA/97) strain infection; the first deaths were observed at 36h h.p.i., and by 72 h, all rabbit had expired. Fig. 4A shows the autopsy results in which typical pathological changes similar to those caused by wild-type RHDV such as diffuse bleeding of tissues and organs, ring hemorrhage of the trachea, and hepatomegaly were observed. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis indicated large amounts of RHDV virions in the tissues (Fig. 4B). In addition, RT-PCR and sequencing of PCR products indicated the mRHDV RNA in post-mortem rabbit tissues (Fig. 4C). These findings show that the target gene was not only present but also contained the mutated RGD site. Lastly, the tissue distribution of the mRHDV was analyzed by quantitative PCR, which showed that it was similar to that of the wild-type strains (Fig. 4D). We have utilized mRHDV strains to infect 293T cells, Vero cells, BHK-21 cells, MDCK cells, and CRFK cells, and RT-PCR analysis indicated that the mRHDV strains do not infect other species of cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Moreover, mice infected with mRHDV or the wild-type RHDV strain did not develop the classic symptoms of RHD and instead remained healthy throughout the course of the study (Table 1). Furthermore, no histopathological changes were observed in the mRHDV-infected mice (Fig. 5C), and RT-PCR analysis indicated the absence of the RHDV genome in the mouse tissues (Fig. 5D), thereby demonstrating that the mRHDV strain does not proliferate in mice.Table 1The details of mRHDV infection assayGroupsAnimalNumberPathogenDosageamRHDV, 1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml; RHDV (JX/CHA/97), 1 × 103 LD50/ml. +, positive; −, negative.MethodClinical signsDeadml1Rabbit3mRHDV1Intramuscular injection+ + +3/3 (100%)2Rabbit3RHDV (JX/CHA/97)1Intramuscular injection+ + +3/3 (100%)3Rabbit3PBS1Intramuscular injection− − −0/3 (0)4Mouse5mRHDV0.1Intramuscular injection− − − − −0/5 (0)5Mouse5RHDV (JX/CHA/97)0.1Intramuscular injection− − − − −0/5 (0)6Mouse5PBS0.1Intramuscular injection− − − − −0/5 (0)a mRHDV, 1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml; RHDV (JX/CHA/97), 1 × 103 LD50/ml. +, positive; −, negative. Open table in a new tab Studies have shown that RHDV can infect rabbit primary hepatocytes, but only about 50% of these cells are infected (26König M. Thiel H.J. Meyers G. Detection of viral proteins after infection of cultured hepatocytes with rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the proliferation of mRHDV in hepatocytes. Rabbit primary hepatocytes were first infected with mRHDV, which then resulted in the appearance of CPEs at 48 h postinfection (Fig. 6A). The generation of antigens was subsequently confirmed by IFA using a VP60-specific antibody. Fig. 6A shows that, at 48 h postinfection with mRHDV, VP60 was clearly detected in the cytoplasm of cells. After the mRHDV strains proliferated for 10 passages of the hepatocytes, VP60 was also detected by Western blot assay using a VP60-specific antibody (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the viral RNA of mRHDV was detected by RT-PCR in mRHDV-infected hepatocytes (Fig. 6C). After 10 passages of the hepatocytes, the virus titer of mRHDV, which was 1 × 105.8 TCID50/ml at 72 h.p.i., was higher than the virus titer of RK-13 cells (Fig. 6D). These findings indicate that mRHDV strains also have the ability to proliferate in primary hepatocytes. However, as the primary hepatocytes were not passaged in vitro, we selected the RK-13 cell line as the host cells for mRHDV proliferation. To analyze the mechanism underlying the entry of mRHDV into the host cell, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with a VP60 antibody in RK-13 cells, and the resulting immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the mRHDV capsid protein (VP60RGD) interacted with the α3β1 integrin (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, the interaction between VP60RGD and α3β1 integrin was verified by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7B). In addition, blocking α3β1 integrin resulted in a significant inhibition of viral replication in RK-13 cells (Fig. 7C). Therefore, we believe that mRHDV makes use of its interaction with α3β1 integrin to mediate entry into the RK-13 cells, which in turn subsequently allows viral replication and protein translation to proceed. To investigate the immunogenicity of mRHDV, rabbits were immunized with inactivated mRHDV, which had undergone 20 passages in RK-13 cells, and antibody responses to RHDV were determined by indirect ELISA. Fig. 8 shows that all of the rabbits vaccinated with the inactivated mRHDV from groups I, II, and III produced antibodies against RHDV at 7 days after immunization, and the antibody levels were similar to those of the positive control animals, which were immunized with the commercial inactivated RHDV vaccine. Twenty-one days later, all of the rabbits were challenged intramuscularly with wild-type RHDV, which indicated that the protection rate of rabbit against wild-type RHDV of groups I, II, and IV was 40, 80, and 80%, respectively (Table 2). Most interesting is that all of the rabbits from group III were fully protected, whereas the rabbits from group V (negative control) died 48–72 h after being challenged with virulent RHDV. These negative control animals exhibited the clinical symptoms of RHD.Table 2The details of protection assay after challenging with virulent RHDVGroupNumberAntigenDosageMethod of immunizationChallenge experimentPathogenMethod of infectionClinical signsProtection levelI5mRHDV1 mla1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml. +, positive; −, negative.SubcutaneousRHDV (JX/CHA/97)Intramuscular injection− − + + +2/5 (40%)II5mRHDV2 mla1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml. +, positive; −, negative.SubcutaneousRHDV (JX/CHA/97)Intramuscular injection− − − − +4/5 (80%)III5mRHDV3 mla1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml. +, positive; −, negative.SubcutaneousRHDV (JX/CHA/97)Intramuscular injection− − − − −5/5 (100%)IV5Commercial vaccine1 doseSubcutaneousRHDV (JX/CHA/97)Intramuscular injection− − − − +4/5 (80%)V5PBS2 mlSubcutaneousRHDV (JX/CHA/97)Intramuscular injection+ + + + +0/5 (0%)a 1 × 104.3 TCID50/ml. +, positive; −, negative. Open table in a new tab Viruses are small in size; however, they are capable of inflicting some of the deadliest diseases around the world. An efficient pathogen is one that has evolved successful ways to colonize host cells using complicated but well orchestrated mechanisms to enter cells, which is critical for replication and sustenance. Due to the complex mechanism of virus entry into host cells, there are still several important pathogens that have not been fully investigated because no suitable in vitro culture system has been developed for research studies on their life cycle, pathogenicity, and control. It is well known that RHDV can infect almost all kinds of rabbits and is associated with high mortality (27Abrantes J. van der Loo W. Le Pendu J. Esteves P.J. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV): a review.Vet. Res. 2012; 43: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, the rabbit and hare industries are seriously threatened by RHDV. Methods to elucidate the pathogenesis of RHDV as soon as possible and develop safe and effective vaccines against RHD are vital in the control and elimination of infectious diseases. However, no suitable cell line for proliferating RHDV in vitro has been identified, thereby impeding investigations on the pathogenesis of RHDV and the development of effective cell culture-derived vaccines. Indirect strategies that have been used in studying RHDV, including the identification of the histo-blood group antigen H type 2, A type 2, and B type 2 oligosaccharides as attachment factors (28Nyström K.

Virol. 2000; 74: 11950-11954Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, other attachment factors or receptors may play roles at the epithelial level because a low expression of the carbohydrate receptor at the site of viral entry confers only partial protection against infection (28Nyström K. Le Gall-Reculé G. Grassi P. Abrantes J. Ruvoën-Clouet N. Le Moullac-Vaidye B. Lopes A.M. Esteves P.J. Strive T. Marchandeau S. Dell A. Haslam S.M. Le Pendu J.

In addition, hepatocytes, the main cellular targets for viral replication, have been shown not to express histo-blood group antigen in young rabbits. However, the infection in young rabbits is accompanied by hepatic lesions due to viral replication, similar to that observed in adults (30Ferreira P.G. Costa-e Silva A. Aguas A.P.

These findings indicate the existence of at least one additional hepatic cellular receptor(s) for RHDV. To date, no new receptors or factors for RHDV have been reported. In the present study, we constructed a mutant RHDV containing two amino acid substitutions and allowed these to enter and grow in rabbit kidney epithelial cells (RK-13). The basis of our work is that the integrins of host cells can recognize the RGD peptide that is located at the surface of some microbial pathogens and thereby mediate entry of the pathogens into host cells. The integrin-RGD recognition system plays an important role in various cellular activities, including cell survival, proliferation, determination of morphology, attachment, migration, and angiogenesis (33Hussein H.A. Walker L.R. Abdel-Raouf U.M. Desouky S.A. Montasser A.K. Akula S.M. Beyond RGD: virus interactions with integrins.Arch. Virol. 2015; 160: 2669-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, integrins are essential for numerous other important biological events such as embryonic development (17Francis S.E. Goh K.L. Hodivala-Dilke K. Bader B.L. Stark M. Davidson D. Hynes R.O.

Retrospective VS on GPCR/ligand co-crystal structures revealed stark differences in the ability of different structures to identify known ligands, despite being co-crystallized with the same ligand. When using the OpenEye toolkit and the ICM modeling package, we identify criteria associated with the predictive power of binding pockets in VS that consists of a combination of ligand/receptor interaction pattern and predicted ligand/receptor interaction strength.

https://openalex.org/W2604945962,"Opiates, one of the oldest known drugs, are the benchmark for treating pain. Regular opioid exposure also induces euphoria making these compounds addictive and often misused, as shown by the current epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose mortalities. In addition to the effect of opioids on their cognate receptors and signaling cascades, these compounds also induce multiple adaptations at cellular and behavioral levels. As omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play a ubiquitous role in behavioral and cellular processes, we proposed that supplemental n-3 PUFAs, enriched in docosahexanoic acid (DHA), could offset these adaptations following chronic opioid exposure. We used an 8 week regimen of n-3 PUFA supplementation followed by 8 days of morphine in the presence of this diet. We first assessed the effect of morphine in different behavioral measures and found that morphine increased anxiety and reduced wheel-running behavior. These effects were reduced by dietary n-3 PUFAs without affecting morphine-induced analgesia or hyperlocomotion, known effects of this opiate acting at mu opioid receptors. At the cellular level we found that morphine reduced striatal DHA content and that this was reversed by supplemental n-3 PUFAs. Chronic morphine also increased glutamatergic plasticity and the proportion of Grin2B-NMDARs in striatal projection neurons. This effect was similarly reversed by supplemental n-3 PUFAs. Gene analysis showed that supplemental PUFAs offset the effect of morphine on genes found in neurons of the dopamine receptor 2 (D2)-enriched indirect pathway but not of genes found in dopamine receptor 1(D1)-enriched direct-pathway neurons. Analysis of the D2 striatal connectome by a retrogradely transported pseudorabies virus showed that n-3 PUFA supplementation reversed the effect of chronic morphine on the innervation of D2 neurons by the dorsomedial prefontal and piriform cortices. Together these changes outline specific behavioral and cellular effects of morphine that can be reduced or reversed by dietary n-3 PUFAs."

Methods A national questionnaire-based survey targeting basic medical researchers was carried in China to investigate the basic information and awareness of SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool, ARRIVE guidelines, GSPC, and animal experimental bias risk control factors. The EpiData3.1 software was used for data entry, and Microsoft Excel 2013 was used for statistical analysis in this study. The number of cases (n) and percentage (%) of classified information were statistically described, and the comparison between groups (i.e., current students vs. research staff) was performed using chi-square test. Results A total of 298 questionnaires were distributed, and 272 responses were received, which included 266 valid questionnaires (from 118 current students and 148 research staff). Among the 266 survey participants, only 15.8% was aware of the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool, with significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.003), and the awareness rates of ARRIVE guidelines and GSPC were only 9.4% and 9.0%, respectively; 58.6% survey participants believed that the reports of animal experimental studies in Chinese literature were inadequate, with significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.004). In addition, only approximately 1/3 of the survey participants had read systematic reviews and meta-analysis reports of animal experimental studies; only 16/266 (6.0%) had carried out/participated in and 11/266 (4.1%) had published systematic reviews/meta-analysis of animal experimental studies. Conclusions The awareness and use rates of SYRCLE’s risk-of-bias tool, the ARRIVE guidelines, and the GSPC were low among Chinese basic medical researchers. Therefore, specific measures are necessary to promote and popularize these standards and specifications and to introduce these standards into guidelines of Chinese domestic journals as soon as possible to raise awareness and increase use rates of researchers and journal editors, thereby improving the quality of animal experimental methods and reports."

Natural killer (NK) cells critically modulate the natural course of HCV infection. Both HIV and HCV mono-infection are associated with alterations of the NK cell pool. However, little data is available concerning phenotype and function of NK cells in HIV/HCV co-infection.A total of 34 HIV/HCV co-infected, 35 HIV and 39 HCV mono-infected patients and 43 healthy control persons were enrolled into this study. All HIV-positive patients were under effective antiretroviral therapy. NK cell phenotype, IFN-γ production and degranulation were studied by flow cytometry.NK cell frequency in HIV/HCV co-infection was significantly lower than in healthy individuals but did not differ from HIV and HCV mono-infection. HIV/HCV co-infection was associated with significantly decreased expression of the maturation/differentiation markers CD27/62L/127 on NK cells but increased expression of CD57 compared to healthy controls. Of note, expression also differed significantly from HCV mono-infection but was similar to HIV mono-infection, suggesting a pronounced impact of HIV on these alterations. Similar findings were made with regard to the NK cell receptors NKG2A/C and NKp30. More importantly, NK cells in co-infection displayed a highly impaired functional activity with significantly lower IFN-γ production and degranulation than in healthy donors as well as HIV and HCV mono-infection, suggesting a synergistic effect of both viruses.Our data indicate that HIV/HCV co-infection is associated with significant alterations of the NK cell pool, which might be involved in the rapid progression of liver disease in co-infected patients and which mainly reflect alterations observed in HIV mono-infection."
https://openalex.org/W2604116164,"Recent advances in gene delivery into cells allow improved therapeutic effects in gene therapy trials. To increase the bioavailability of applied cells, it is of great interest that transfected cells remain at the application site and systemic spread is minimized. In this study, we tested clinically used biodegradable poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds (Vicryl & Ethisorb) as transient carriers for genetically modified cells. To this aim, we used human fibroblasts and examined attachment and proliferation of untransfected cells on the scaffolds in vitro, as well as the mechanical properties of the scaffolds at four time points (1, 3, 6 and 9 days) of cultivation. Furthermore, the adherence of cells transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) and also VEGF165 protein secretion were investigated. Our results show that human fibroblasts adhere on both types of PLGA scaffolds. However, proliferation and transgene expression capacity were higher on Ethisorb scaffolds most probably due to a different architecture of the scaffold. Additionally, cultivation of the cells on the scaffolds did not alter their biomechanical properties. The results of this investigation could be potentially exploited in therapeutic regiments with areal delivery of transiently transfected cells and may open the way for a variety of applications of cell-based gene therapy, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2605007444,"Background Despite bearing the largest HIV-related burden, little is known of the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the factors contributing to this gap in knowledge is the lack of culturally adapted and validated measures of HRQoL that are relevant for this setting. Aims We set out to adapt the Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI) Questionnaire, an HIV-specific measure of HRQoL, and evaluate its internal consistency and validity. Methods The three phase mixed-methods study took place in a rural setting at the Kenyan Coast. Phase one involved a scoping review to describe the evidence base of the reliability and validity of FAHI as well as the geographical contexts in which it has been administered. Phase two involved in-depth interviews (n = 38) to explore the content validity, and initial piloting for face validation of the adapted FAHI. Phase three was quantitative (n = 103) and evaluated the internal consistency, convergent and construct validities of the adapted interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results In the first phase of the study, we identified 16 studies that have used the FAHI. Most (82%) were conducted in North America. Only seven (44%) of the reviewed studies reported on the psychometric properties of the FAHI. In the second phase, most of the participants (37 out of 38) reported satisfaction with word clarity and content coverage whereas 34 (89%) reported satisfaction with relevance of the items, confirming the face validity of the adapted questionnaire during initial piloting. Our participants indicated that HIV impacted on their physical, functional, emotional, and social wellbeing. Their responses overlapped with items in four of the five subscales of the FAHI Questionnaire establishing its content validity. In the third phase, the internal consistency of the scale was found to be satisfactory with subscale Cronbach’s α ranging from 0.55 to 0.78. The construct and convergent validity of the tool were supported by acceptable factor loadings for most of the items on the respective sub-scales and confirmation of expected significant correlations of the FAHI subscale scores with scores of a measure of common mental disorders. Conclusion The adapted interviewer-administered Swahili version of FAHI questionnaire showed initial strong evidence of good psychometric properties with satisfactory internal consistency and acceptable validity (content, face, and convergent validity). It gives impetus for further validation work, especially construct validity, in similar settings before it can be used for research and clinical purposes in the entire East African region."
https://openalex.org/W2605289509,"Introduction Fluid administration in critically ill patients may affect acid-base balance. However, the effect of the fluid type used for resuscitation on acid-base balance remains controversial. Methods We studied the effect of fluid resuscitation of normal saline and the colloids gelatine 4%, hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6%, and albumin 5% on acid-base balance in 115 clinically hypovolemic critically ill patients during a 90 minute filling pressure-guided fluid challenge by a post-hoc analysis of a prospective randomized clinical trial. Results About 1700 mL was infused per patient in the saline and 1500 mL in each of the colloid groups (P<0.001). Overall, fluid loading slightly decreased pH (P<0.001) and there was no intergroup difference. This mildly metabolic acidifying effect was caused by a small increase in chloride concentration and decrease in strong ion difference in the saline- and HES-, and an increase in (uncorrected) anion gap in gelatine- and albumin-loaded patients, independent of lactate concentrations. Conclusion In clinically hypovolemic, critically ill patients, fluid resuscitation by only 1500–1700 mL of normal saline, gelatine, HES or albumin, resulted in a small decrease in pH, irrespective of the type of fluid used. Therefore, a progressive metabolic acidosis, even with increased anion gap, should not be erroneously attributed to insufficient fluid resuscitation.

https://openalex.org/W2605015333,"Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans are two closely related species. Although C. dubliniensis is less pathogenic, it has a higher propensity to develop resistance to fluconazole and some strains exhibit intrinsic resistance to 5-flucytosine (5-FC). All 5-FC-resistant isolates from Kuwait were previously shown to belong to one of seven internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA-based haplotypes. This study performed fingerprinting of C. dubliniensis isolates by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to determine population structure of 5-FC-resistant and -susceptible strains and compared the results with data from a global collection of isolates. Fifty-two C. dubliniensis isolates previously analyzed and 58 additional isolates mostly collected during 2010–2013 and characterized by phenotypic and molecular methods were used. ITS-based haplotypes were identified by haplotype-specific PCR and/or by PCR-DNA sequencing of rDNA. Population structure was determined by 8-loci-based MLST. E-test was used to determine susceptibility to 5-FC, fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. Five ITS haplotypes (ITSH) were detected among 110 C. dubliniensis isolates. The ITSH1 was most common (n = 80 isolates) followed by ITSH4 (n = 25 isolates). Two isolates each belonged to ITSH5 and ITSH8 while one isolate belonged to ITSH7. MLST identified 16 diploid sequence types (DSTs) including six new DSTs. DST11 (n = 52) and DST14 (n = 25) were dominant genotypes and were confined (together with DST21) to Middle-Eastern countries. Other DSTs (excluding some new DSTs) had a wider global distribution as they were identified from various other countries. Only ITSH4 isolates (n = 25) belonged to DST14, were resistant to 5-FC and contained S29L mutation in CdFCA1. ITSH5, ITSH7 and ITSH8 isolates belonged to different DSTs. Thus, clinical C. dubliniensis isolates in Kuwait exhibited limited genotypic heterogeneity and most isolates belonged to region-specific DSTs. All 5-FC-resistant C. dubliniensis isolates belonged to ITSH4 and MLST-based DST14 genotype. Placement of some isolates into additional ITS haplotypes is also supported by MLST data."
https://openalex.org/W2605238228,"APOBEC3G (A3G) belongs to the AID/APOBEC protein family of cytidine deaminases (CDA) that bind to nucleic acids. A3G mutates the HIV genome by deamination of dC to dU, leading to accumulation of virus-inactivating mutations. Binding to cellular RNAs inhibits A3G binding to substrate single-stranded (ss) DNA and CDA activity. Bulk RNA and substrate ssDNA bind to the same three A3G tryptic peptides (amino acids 181-194, 314-320, and 345-374) that form parts of a continuously exposed protein surface extending from the catalytic domain in the C terminus of A3G to its N terminus. We show here that the A3G tyrosines 181 and 315 directly cross-linked ssDNA. Binding experiments showed that a Y315A mutation alone significantly reduced A3G binding to both ssDNA and RNA, whereas Y181A and Y182A mutations only moderately affected A3G nucleic acid binding. Consistent with these findings, the Y315A mutant exhibited little to no deaminase activity in an Escherichia coli DNA mutator reporter, whereas Y181A and Y182A mutants retained ∼50% of wild-type A3G activity. The Y315A mutant also showed a markedly reduced ability to assemble into viral particles and had reduced antiviral activity. In uninfected cells, the impaired RNA-binding capacity of Y315A was evident by a shift of A3G from high-molecular-mass ribonucleoprotein complexes to low-molecular-mass complexes. We conclude that Tyr-315 is essential for coordinating ssDNA interaction with or entry to the deaminase domain and hypothesize that RNA bound to Tyr-315 may be sufficient to competitively inhibit ssDNA deaminase-dependent antiviral activity."
https://openalex.org/W2604519841,"The effect of the environment may result in different developmental outcomes. Extrinsic signals can modify developmental pathways and result in alternative phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity). The environment can also be interpreted as a stressor and increase developmental instability (developmental noise). Directional and fluctuating asymmetry provide a conceptual background to discriminate between these results. This study aims at assessing whether variation in dentition and shape of pharyngeal arches of the clonal fish Chrosomus eos-neogaeus results from developmental instability or environmentally induced changes. A total of 262 specimens of the Chrosomus eos-neogaeus complex from 12 natural sites were analysed. X-ray microcomputed tomography (X-ray micro-CT) was used to visualize the pharyngeal arches in situ with high resolution. Variation in the number of pharyngeal teeth is high in hybrids in contrast to the relative stability observed in both parental species. The basal dental formula is symmetric while the most frequent alternative dental formula is asymmetric. Within one lineage, large variation in the proportion of individuals bearing basal or alternative dental formulae was observed among sites in the absence of genetic difference. Both dentition and arch shape of this hybrid lineage were explained significantly by environmental differences. Only individuals bearing asymmetric dental formula displayed fluctuating asymmetry as well as directional left-right asymmetry for the arches. The hybrids appeared sensitive to environmental signals and intraspecific variation on pharyngeal teeth was not random but reflects phenotypic plasticity. Altogether, these results support the influence of the environment as a trigger for an alternative developmental pathway resulting in left-right asymmetry in dentition and shape of pharyngeal arches."
https://openalex.org/W2604181094,"Background The diseased human myocardium is highly susceptible to ischemia/reoxygenation (I/R)-induced injury but its response to protective interventions such as ischemic preconditioning (IPreC) is unclear. Cardiac and other pre-existing clinical conditions as well as previous or ongoing medical treatment may influence the myocardial response to I/R injury and protection. This study investigated the effect of both on myocardial susceptibility to I/R-induced injury and the protective effects of IPreC. Methods and results Atrial myocardium from cardiac surgery patients (n = 300) was assigned to one of three groups: aerobic control, I/R alone, and IPreC. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage, as a marker of cell injury, and cell viability were measured. The basal redox status was determined in samples from 90 patients. The response to I/R varied widely. Myocardium from patients with aortic valve disease was the most susceptible to injury whereas myocardium from dyslipidemia patients was the least susceptible. Tissue from females was better protected than tissue from males. Myocardium from patients with mitral valve disease was the least responsive to IPreC. The basal redox status was altered in the myocardium from patients with mitral and aortic valve disease. Conclusions The response of the myocardium to I/R and IPreC is highly variable and influenced by the underlying cardiac pathology, dyslipidemia, sex, and the basal redox status. These results should be taken into account in the design of future clinical studies on the prevention of I/R injury and protection."
https://openalex.org/W2605206438,"It has been proposed that a subpopulation of tumour cells with stem cell-like characteristics, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), drives tumour initiation and generates tumour heterogeneity, thus leading to cancer metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. Although there has been substantial progress in CSC research into many solid tumour types, an understanding of the biology of CSCs in lung cancer remains elusive, mainly because of their heterogeneous origins and high plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that engineered lung cancer cells derived from normal human airway basal epithelial cells possessed CSC-like characteristics in terms of multilineage differentiation potential and strong tumour-initiating ability. Moreover, we established an in vitro 3D culture system that allowed the in vivo differentiation process of the CSC-like cells to be recapitulated. This engineered CSC model provides valuable opportunities for studying the biology of CSCs and for exploring and evaluating novel therapeutic approaches and targets in lung CSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2604313869,"While recent studies suggest an influence of noise on olfactory performance, it is unclear as to what extent the influence varies between subjects who are accustomed to noise and those who are not. Two groups of panelists were selected: a University panel usually working under silent conditions and an abattoir panel usually working on the slaughter line with abattoir noise. Odor discrimination, odor identification, and odor detection thresholds were studied. Furthermore, a sensory quality control task using 40 boar samples was performed. All tests were accomplished both with and without extraneous noise recorded at an abattoir (70 dB) using headphones. Contrary to the researchers' expectations, abattoir noise hardly affected the olfactory tests nor was the quality control task impaired. Abattoir noise did not influence the perceived intensity of boar taint and the classification results of the testers, regardless of whether they were accustomed to such noise or not. The results indicate that sensory quality control can be conducted in a manufacturing environment with constant noise without diminishing the assessors' performance."
https://openalex.org/W2605332858,"Individuals possessing absolute pitch (AP) are able to identify a given musical tone or to reproduce it without reference to another tone. The present study sought to learn whether this exceptional auditory ability impacts visual perception under stimulus conditions that provoke visual competition in the form of binocular rivalry. Nineteen adult participants with 3-19 years of musical training were divided into two groups according to their performance on a task involving identification of the specific note associated with hearing a given musical pitch. During test trials lasting just over half a minute, participants dichoptically viewed a scrolling musical score presented to one eye and a drifting sinusoidal grating presented to the other eye; throughout the trial they pressed buttons to track the alternations in visual awareness produced by these dissimilar monocular stimuli. On ""pitch-congruent"" trials, participants heard an auditory melody that was congruent in pitch with the visual score, on ""pitch-incongruent"" trials they heard a transposed auditory melody that was congruent with the score in melody but not in pitch, and on ""melody-incongruent"" trials they heard an auditory melody completely different from the visual score. For both groups, the visual musical scores predominated over the gratings when the auditory melody was congruent compared to when it was incongruent. Moreover, the AP participants experienced greater predominance of the visual score when it was accompanied by the pitch-congruent melody compared to the same melody transposed in pitch; for non-AP musicians, pitch-congruent and pitch-incongruent trials yielded equivalent predominance. Analysis of individual durations of dominance revealed differential effects on dominance and suppression durations for AP and non-AP participants. These results reveal that AP is accompanied by a robust form of bisensory interaction between tonal frequencies and musical notation that boosts the salience of a visual score."
https://openalex.org/W2604246443,"Here we assess the fitness consequences of the replacement of the Hoxa1 coding region with its paralog Hoxb1 in mice (Mus musculus) residing in semi-natural enclosures. Previously, this Hoxa1B1 swap was reported as resulting in no discernible embryonic or physiological phenotype (i.e., functionally redundant), despite the 51% amino acid sequence differences between these two Hox proteins. Within heterozygous breeding cages no differences in litter size nor deviations from Mendelian genotypic expectations were observed in the outbred progeny; however, within semi-natural population enclosures mice homozygous for the Hoxa1B1 swap were out-reproduced by controls resulting in the mutant allele being only 87.5% as frequent as the control in offspring born within enclosures. Specifically, Hoxa1B1 founders produced only 77.9% as many offspring relative to controls, as measured by homozygous pups, and a 22.1% deficiency of heterozygous offspring was also observed. These data suggest that Hoxa1 and Hoxb1 have diverged in function through either sub- or neo-functionalization and that the HoxA1 and HoxB1 proteins are not mutually interchangeable when expressed from the Hoxa1 locus. The fitness assays conducted under naturalistic conditions in this study have provided an ultimate-level assessment of the postulated equivalence of competing alleles. Characterization of these differences has provided greater understanding of the forces shaping the maintenance and diversifications of Hox genes as well as other paralogous genes. This fitness assay approach can be applied to any genetic manipulation and often provides the most sensitive way to detect functional differences."

Before you vanish for good, your colleagues look forward to an interesting but entertaining account of the ups-and-downs of your past research and your views on science in general, peppered with indiscrete anecdotes about your former competitors and collaborators. What follows will disappoint those who await complaint and criticism, for example, about the difficulties of doing research in the 1960s and 1970s in Eastern Europe, or those seeking very personal revelations. My scientific life has in fact seen many happy coincidences, much good fortune, and several lucky escapes from situations that at the time were quite scary. I have also been fortunate with regard to competitors and collaborators, particularly because, whenever possible, I tried to neutralize my rivals by collaborating with them - to the benefit of all. I recommend this strategy to young researchers to dispel the nightmares that can occur when competing against powerful contenders. I have been blessed with the selection of my research topic: RNA biology. Over the last five decades, new and unexpected RNA-related phenomena emerged almost yearly. I experienced them very personally while studying transcription, translation, RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and more recently, different classes of regulatory non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs. Some selected research and para-research stories, also covering many wonderful people I had a privilege to work with, are summarized below."
https://openalex.org/W2604286923,"Individual differences in sensorimotor adaptability may permit customized training protocols for optimum learning. Here, we sought to forecast individual adaptive capabilities in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Subjects performed 400 head-rotation steps (400 trials) during a baseline test, followed by 20 min of VOR gain adaptation. All subjects exhibited mean baseline VOR gain of approximately 1.0, variable from trial to trial, and showed desired reductions in gain following adaptation with variation in extent across individuals. The extent to which a given subject adapted was inversely proportional to a measure of the strength and duration of baseline inter-trial correlations (β). β is derived from the decay of the autocorrelation of the sequence of VOR gains, and describes how strongly correlated are past gain values; it thus indicates how much the VOR gain on any given trial is informed by performance on previous trials. To maximize the time that images are stabilized on the retina, the VOR should maintain a gain close to 1.0 that is adjusted predominantly according to the most recent error; hence, it is not surprising that individuals who exhibit smaller β (weaker inter-trial correlations) also exhibited the best adaptation. Our finding suggests that the temporal structure of baseline behavioral data contains important information that may aid in forecasting adaptive capacities. This has significant implications for the development of personalized physical therapy protocols for patients, and for other cases when it is necessary to adjust motor programs to maintain movement accuracy in response to pathological and environmental changes."
