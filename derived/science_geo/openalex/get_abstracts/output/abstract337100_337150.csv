https://openalex.org/W2048087720,"Examination of aggregate data on graduate admissions to the University of California, Berkeley, for fall 1973 shows a clear but misleading pattern of bias against female applicants. Examination of the disaggregated data reveals few decision-making units that show statistically significant departures from expected frequencies of female admissions, and about as many units appear to favor women as to favor men. If the data are properly pooled, taking into account the autonomy of departmental decision making, thus correcting for the tendency of women to apply to graduate departments that are more difficult for applicants of either sex to enter, there is a small but statistically significant bias in favor of women. The graduate departments that are easier to enter tend to be those that require more mathematics in the undergraduate preparatory curriculum. The bias in the aggregated data stems not from any pattern of discrimination on the part of admissions committees, which seem quite fair on the whole, but apparently from prior screening at earlier levels of the educational system. Women are shunted by their socialization and education toward fields of graduate study that are generally more crowded, less productive of completed degrees, and less well funded, and that frequently offer poorer professional employment prospects."

Thus any tendency for plant cover to decrease would be reinforced by a decrease in rainfall, and could initiate or perpetuate a drought."

They adjust their responses according to the male pattern, and attract males of four species with distinctively different flashed responses. The capabilities of the firefly brain are more complex than previously suspected. The mimicry is quite effective, and females seldom answered more than ten males without catching one."

By using enzyme assays it was determined that up to 50 percent of the organic fraction is hydrolyzable by phytase. The enzymatically degradable material consists of both low and high molecular weight fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2027708057,"Mount St. Helens volcano in southern Washington has erupted many times during the last 4000 years, usually after brief dormant periods. This behavior pattern. suggests that the volcano, last active in 1857, will erupt again-perhaps within the next few decades. Potential volcanic hazards of several kinds should be considered in planning for land use near the volcano."
https://openalex.org/W2080534840,A (4.60 ± 0.07) × 109 year internal isochron has been drawn for the achondrite Juvinas by the rubidium-87/strontium-87 method. Earlier petrographic investigation of achondrites supplemented by a new ion microprobe study of Juvinas strongly suggest an igneous origin for this class of meteorites. The results thus indicate that igneous activity may have rapidly followed the formation of the achondrites' parent body 4.6 × 109 years ago.
https://openalex.org/W2003592663,"Comparative study of pollen of the ranalean complex has revealed a remarkable, hitherto unrecognized characteristic of primitive angiosperm pollen, namely, its complete lack of columellae. Pollen with such exine has been desnated atectate anid taxa in the Magnoliaceae. Degenzeriaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Annonraceae, and possibly Himantandraceae and Nymphaeaceae have pollen which is considered to be primitively columellaless."
https://openalex.org/W2048295648,"The structure factor of amorphous solid D2O deposited from the vapor at 10°K has been obtained by measuring the neutron diffraction spectrum in the wave vector transfer from 0.8 to 12.3 reciprocal angstroms. The results indicate that the phase investigated is amorphous and has a liquid-like structure factor. The Fourier-transformed structure factor yields a real space pair distribution function consistent with local tetrahedral coordination and hydrogen bonding, as in other condensed phases of water. The intramolecular OD separation is 1.00 angstrom; the lack of data for very large wave vector transfer and the expected near equality of the intramolecular DD separation and intermolecular O . . . D separation make it impossible to determine the intramolecular DOD angle with precision. The neutron scattering data presented are complementary to the x-ray diffraction studies of Venkatesh, Rice, and Narten."
https://openalex.org/W2012665244,"Modern crises present decision makers with many agonizing management choices. Very often a crisis manager is confronted with a plethora of conflicting information and given very little time to choose an appropriate course of action. Although contemporary methods of systems analysis have been used in attempts to organize data and clarify options, they have generally been of little use in presenting an accurate picture of an opponent's values and perceptions. Thus it is clear that we must now make use of the improved communications and technological devices at our disposal if crises are to be avoided or resolved with minimum damage. Our proposal to establish international model-oriented computer-assisted conferences is designed to promote greater cooperation and understanding among scientists and crisis managers of differing nations by enabling them to share images of themselves and one another. With better information and more rational options available, the chances of catastrophic misunderstanding or miscalculation can be meaningfully reduced. We have proposed a possible scenario for the initial implementation of such a system to combat famine, and hope that the same approach might be used in other areas over time. The ultimate goal is a system by which specialists of all persuasions cooperate so that international crises will be resolved on the bases of mutual benefits without resort to armed conflict."

https://openalex.org/W1966288664,"We observed the radio emission of Callisto with a three-element interferometer at the time of the 1973 opposition of Jupiter. Special care was taken to remove the residual, unresolved contribution from Jupiter itself in the antenna side lobes. The resulting disk temperature at a wavelength of 3.71 centimeters, assuming a radius of 2500+/-75 kilometers for Callisto, was 101 degrees +/-25 degrees K. This temperature is much more consistent with emission from a simple dielectric sphere than the considerably higher temnperatures that have been reported for wavelengths of 3.5 and 8.2 millimeters."
