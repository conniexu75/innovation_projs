Anthrax toxin uses its protective antigen (PA) component to form pores in the endosomal membrane to translocate its enzymic components, lethal factor and oedema factor, into the target cells. Hong Zhou and colleagues have used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the PA pore structure at an impressive resolution of 2.9 Å. The structure reveals the long-sought catalytic 'Φ-clamp' or phenylalanine clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation channel, and supports a Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation. Anthrax toxin, comprising protective antigen, lethal factor, and oedema factor, is the major virulence factor of Bacillus anthracis, an agent that causes high mortality in humans and animals. Protective antigen forms oligomeric prepores that undergo conversion to membrane-spanning pores by endosomal acidification, and these pores translocate the enzymes lethal factor and oedema factor into the cytosol of target cells1. Protective antigen is not only a vaccine component and therapeutic target for anthrax infections but also an excellent model system for understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. On the basis of biochemical and electrophysiological results, researchers have proposed that a phi (Φ)-clamp composed of phenylalanine (Phe)427 residues of protective antigen catalyses protein translocation via a charge-state-dependent Brownian ratchet2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Although atomic structures of protective antigen prepores are available10,11,12,13,14, how protective antigen senses low pH, converts to active pore, and translocates lethal factor and oedema factor are not well defined without an atomic model of its pore. Here, by cryo-electron microscopy with direct electron counting, we determine the protective antigen pore structure at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals the long-sought-after catalytic Φ-clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation channel, and supports the Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation. Comparisons of four structures reveal conformational changes in prepore to pore conversion that support a multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed."
https://openalex.org/W2080443045,"Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) have been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. Plasma Lp(a) levels are reduced by monoclonal antibodies targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). However, the mechanism of Lp(a) catabolism in vivo and the role of PCSK9 in this process are unknown. We report that Lp(a) internalization by hepatic HepG2 cells and primary human fibroblasts was effectively reduced by PCSK9. Overexpression of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) in HepG2 cells dramatically increased the internalization of Lp(a). Internalization of Lp(a) was markedly reduced following treatment of HepG2 cells with a function-blocking monoclonal antibody against the LDLR or the use of primary human fibroblasts from an individual with familial hypercholesterolemia; in both cases, Lp(a) internalization was not affected by PCSK9. Optimal Lp(a) internalization in both hepatic and primary human fibroblasts was dependent on the LDL rather than the apolipoprotein(a) component of Lp(a). Lp(a) internalization was also dependent on clathrin-coated pits, and Lp(a) was targeted for lysosomal and not proteasomal degradation. Our data provide strong evidence that the LDLR plays a role in Lp(a) catabolism and that this process can be modulated by PCSK9. These results provide a direct mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of PCSK9 in effectively lowering Lp(a) levels. Background: Plasma lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels can be reduced through proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) through an unknown mechanism. Results: Lp(a) catabolism in hepatoma cells and primary fibroblasts is inhibited by PCSK9 via the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Conclusion: LDLR mediates the effects of PCSK9 on Lp(a) internalization. Significance: Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on plasma Lp(a) levels."
https://openalex.org/W1981328412,"Objective Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) plays a vital role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Previous studies have reported its prognostic value in different tumors. However, the results of these reports remain controversial. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify this issue. Methods A search of the PubMed, Embase and CNKI databases was conducted to analyze relevant articles. The outcomes included the relations between FAP expression and histological differentiation, tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and overall survival (OS). Sensitivity analysis by FAP expression in different cells and tumor types were further subjected to sensitivity analyses as subgroups. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were evaluated using the random-effects model. Results The global analysis included 15 studies concerning various solid tumors. For global analysis, FAP overexpression in tumor tissue displayed significant associations with poor OS and tumor progression (OS: HR = 2.18, P = 0.004; tumor invasion: OR = 4.48, P = 0.007; and lymph node metastasis: OR = 3.80, P = 0.004). The subgroup analyses yielded two notable results. First, the relation between FAP overexpression and poor OS and tumor lymph node metastasis was closer in the patients with FAP expression in tumor cells. Second, the pooled analyses of colorectal cancers or pancreatic cancers all indicated that FAP overexpression was associated with a detrimental OS (HR: 1.72, P = 0.009; HR: 3.18, P = 0.005, respectively). The magnitude of this effect was not statistically significant compared with that in patients with non-colorectal cancers or non-pancreatic cancers. These analyses did not display a statistically significant correlation between FAP expression and histological differentiation and distant metastasis in all of the groups. Conclusions FAP expression is associated with worse prognosis in solid tumors, and this association is particularly pronounced if FAP overexpression is found in the tumor cells rather than the stroma."
https://openalex.org/W2088032380,"Necroptosis is an alternate programmed cell death pathway that is unleashed by caspase-8 compromise and mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3). Murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) encode caspase-8 inhibitors that prevent apoptosis together with competitors of RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-dependent signal transduction to interrupt the necroptosis. Here, we show that pro-necrotic murine CMV M45 mutant virus drives virus-induced necroptosis during nonproductive infection of RIP3-expressing human fibroblasts, whereas WT virus does not. Thus, M45-encoded RHIM competitor, viral inhibitor of RIP activation, sustains viability of human cells like it is known to function in infected mouse cells. Importantly, human CMV is shown to block necroptosis induced by either TNF or M45 mutant murine CMV in RIP3-expressing human cells. Human CMV blocks TNF-induced necroptosis after RIP3 activation and phosphorylation of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase. An early, IE1-regulated viral gene product acts on a necroptosis step that follows MLKL phosphorylation prior to membrane leakage. This suppression strategy is distinct from RHIM signaling competition by murine CMV or HSV and interrupts an execution process that has not yet been fully elaborated."
https://openalex.org/W2047571950,"The accumulation of proline (Pro) in plants exposed to biotic/abiotic stress is a well-documented and conserved response in most vegetal species. Stress conditions induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species which can lead to cellular damage. In vitro assays have shown that enzyme inactivation by hydroxyl radicals (·OH) can be avoided in presence of Pro, suggesting that this amino acid could act as an ·OH scavenger. We applied Density Functional Theory coupled with a polarizable continuum model to elucidate how Pro reacts with ·OH. In this work we suggest that Pro reacts favourably with ·OH by H–abstraction on the amine group. This reaction produces the spontaneous decarboxylation of Pro leading to the formation of pyrrolidin-1-yl. In turn, pyrrolidin-1-yl can easily be converted to Δ1-pyrroline, the substrate of the enzyme Δ1-pyrroline dehydrogenase, which produces γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA and Pro are frequently accumulated in stressed plants and several protective roles have been assigned to these molecules. Thereby we present an alternative non-enzymatic way to synthetize GABA under oxidative stress. Finally this work sheds light on a new beneficial role of Pro accumulation in the maintenance of photosynthetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2068861063,"Drug shortages are a complex and global phenomenon. When a drug cannot be delivered at the moment of patient demand, every stakeholder in the health care system is affected. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics, clinical impact, financial impact and management of drug shortages in European hospital pharmacies and identify opportunities for prevention and mitigation of drug shortages in Europe. An online survey was designed based on a review of the literature and interviews and was sent to subscribers of Hospital Pharmacy Europe between June and September 2013. Forty-five percent of respondents (n = 161) indicated that life sustaining or life preserving drugs such as oncology drugs were affected by drug shortages. More than 30% of respondents indicated that drug shortages in Europe were always or often associated with increased costs for hospitals, increased personnel costs and more expensive alternative drugs (n = 161). On the question when information about a drug shortage was obtained, 42% of respondents answered that information from the pharmaceutical company was obtained at the time of no delivery, 50% indicated that information from the wholesaler was obtained at the time of no delivery, while 40% of respondents indicated that information was never or rarely received from the government (n = 161). Fifty seven percent of respondents strongly agreed that an obligation to the producer to notify further shortages could help to solve the problem (n = 161). These results showed that pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers are already involved in the management of drug shortages, while a role is still reserved for the government. Mandatory notification in advance and centralized information can help to reduce workload for hospital pharmacists, will allow early anticipation of drug shortages and will facilitate mitigation of the clinical impact on patients."
https://openalex.org/W1978134672,"Vascular injury induces a potent inflammatory response that influences vessel remodeling and patency, limiting long-term benefits of cardiovascular interventions such as angioplasty. Specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) derived from ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] orchestrate resolution in diverse settings of acute inflammation. We hypothesized that systemic administration of DHA-derived SPMs [resolvin D2 (RvD2) and maresin 1 (MaR1)] would influence vessel remodeling in a mouse model of arterial neointima formation (carotid ligation). In vitro, SPM treatment inhibited mouse aortic smooth muscle cell migration (IC50 ≅ 1 nM) to a PDGF gradient and reduced TNF-α-stimulated p65 translocation, superoxide production, and proinflammatory gene expression (MCP-1). In vivo, adult FVB mice underwent unilateral carotid artery ligation with administration of RvD2, MaR1, or vehicle (100 ng by intraperitoneal injection at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 d after ligation). In ligated carotid arteries at 4 d, SPM treatment was associated with reduced cell proliferation and neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and increased polarization of M2 macrophages in the arterial wall. Neointimal hyperplasia (at 14 d) was notably attenuated in RvD2 (62%)- and MaR1 (67%)-treated mice, respectively. Modulation of resolution pathways may offer new opportunities to regulate the vascular injury response and promote vascular homeostasis.—Akagi, D., Chen, M., Toy, R., Chatterjee, A., Conte, M. S.

https://openalex.org/W2136028316,"In this study, a total of nine different biotransformation products of the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) formed in wheat during detoxification of the toxin are characterized by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The detected metabolites suggest that DON is conjugated to endogenous metabolites via two major metabolism routes, namely 1) glucosylation (DON-3-glucoside, DON-di-hexoside, 15-acetyl-DON-3-glucoside, DON-malonylglucoside) and 2) glutathione conjugation (DON-S-glutathione, ""DON-2H""-S-glutathione, DON-S-cysteinyl-glycine and DON-S-cysteine). Furthermore, conjugation of DON to a putative sugar alcohol (hexitol) was found. A molar mass balance for the cultivar 'Remus' treated with 1 mg DON revealed that under the test conditions approximately 15% of the added DON were transformed into DON-3-glucoside and another 19% were transformed to the remaining eight biotransformation products or irreversibly bound to the plant matrix. Additionally, metabolite abundance was monitored as a function of time for each DON derivative and was established for six DON treated wheat lines (1 mg/ear) differing in resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) Fhb1 and/or Qfhs.ifa-5A. All cultivars carrying QTL Fhb1 showed similar metabolism kinetics: Formation of DON-Glc was faster, while DON-GSH production was less efficient compared to cultivars which lacked the resistance QTL Fhb1. Moreover, all wheat lines harboring Fhb1 showed significantly elevated D3G/DON abundance ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2086525624,"This study integrated accessibility and location-allocation models in geographic information systems as a proposed strategy to improve the spatial planning of public health services. To estimate the spatial accessibility, we modified the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) model with a different impedance function, a Gaussian weight for competition among service sites, a friction coefficient, distances along a street network based on the Dijkstra’s algorithm and by performing a vectorial analysis. To check the accuracy of the strategy, we used the data from the public sterilization program for the dogs and cats of Bogot´a, Colombia. Since the proposed strategy is independent of the service, it could also be applied to any other public intervention when the capacity of the service is known. The results of the accessibility model were consistent with the sterilization program data, revealing that the western, central and northern zones are the most isolated areas under the sterilization program. Spatial accessibility improvement was sought by relocating the sterilization sites using the maximum coverage with finite demand and the p-median models. The relocation proposed by the maximum coverage model more effectively maximized the spatial accessibility to the sterilization service given the non-uniform distribution of the populations of dogs and cats throughout the city. The implementation of the proposed strategy would provide direct benefits by improving the effectiveness of different public health interventions and the use of financial and human resources."
https://openalex.org/W1972638185,"Gaucher disease, a recessive inherited metabolic disorder caused by defects in the gene encoding glucosylceramidase (GlcCerase), can be divided into three subtypes according to the appearance of symptoms associated with central nervous system involvement. We now identify a protein, glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB), that acts as an authentic marker of brain pathology in neurological forms of Gaucher disease. Using three independent techniques, including quantitative global proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in samples from Gaucher disease patients that display neurological symptoms, we demonstrate a correlation between the severity of symptoms and GPNMB levels. Moreover, GPNMB levels in the CSF correlate with disease severity in a mouse model of Gaucher disease. GPNMB was also elevated in brain samples from patients with type 2 and 3 Gaucher disease. Our data suggest that GPNMB can be used as a marker to quantify neuropathology in Gaucher disease patients and as a marker of treatment efficacy once suitable treatments towards the neurological symptoms of Gaucher disease become available."
https://openalex.org/W2005531517,"Background Several evidences suggest that the position of palmitic acid (PA) in dietary triacylglycerol (TAG) influences different biological functions. We aimed at evaluating whether dietary fat with highly enriched (87%) PA in sn-2 position (Hsn-2 PA), by increasing PA incorporation into tissue phospholipids (PL), modifies fatty acid profile and biosynthesis of fatty acid—derived bioactive lipids, such as endocannabinoids and their congeners. Study Design Rats were fed for 5 weeks diets containing Hsn-2 PA or fat with PA randomly distributed in TAG with 18.8% PA in sn-2 position (Lsn-2 PA), and similar total PA concentration. Fatty acid profile in different lipid fractions, endocannabinoids and congeners were measured in intestine, liver, visceral adipose tissue, muscle and brain. Results Rats on Hsn-2 PA diet had lower levels of anandamide with concomitant increase of its congener palmitoylethanolamide and its precursor PA into visceral adipose tissue phospholipids. In addition, we found an increase of oleoylethanolamide, an avid PPAR alpha ligand, in liver, muscle and brain, associated to higher levels of its precursor oleic acid in liver and muscle, probably derived by elongation and further delta 9 desaturation of PA. Changes in endocannabinoids and congeners were associated to a decrease of circulating TNF alpha after LPS challenge, and to an improved feed efficiency. Conclusions Dietary Hsn-2 PA, by modifying endocannabinoids and congeners biosynthesis in different tissues may potentially concur in the physiological regulation of energy metabolism, brain function and body fat distribution."

Here we demonstrate that overexpression of Fbxl7 in lung epithelia decreases the protein abundance of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family. Fbxl7 mediates polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of survivin by interacting with Glu-126 within its carboxyl-terminal α helix. Furthermore, both Lys-90 and Lys-91 within survivin serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites.

Apoptosis plays essential roles in organogenesis and as a natural process to remove damaged or abnormal cells that arise in the course of numerous biological events, such as recovery from inflammation or tissue injury. In mammalian systems, apoptosis occurs through two pathways: the extrinsic pathway, utilizing cell surface death receptors that recognize ligands, and the intrinsic pathway, including the mitochondrion as an essential component (1.Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Death receptors: signaling and modulation.Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). In response to cellular stress, proapoptotic proteins translocate to the mitochondria, where they activate Bax and Bak, which trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which subsequently allows the release of cytochrome c and other mediators that induce caspase activation and ensuing apoptosis (2.Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. The BCL-2 family reunion.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar).

Cellular protein concentrations and subsequent biological function are largely controlled by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The ubiquitylation of a target protein in humans is carefully orchestrated by an enzymatic cascade including a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), approximately one of 30 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and a ubiquitin E3 ligase, of which hundreds exist in cells. E3 ligases confer specificity to ubiquitylation by recruiting substrates and mediating the transfer of activated ubiquitin from an E2 to a substrate (13.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6879) Google Scholar). Over 600 human genes encode RING domain-containing E3 ligases (14.Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 399-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Among these E3 ligases, the SCF superfamily modulates diverse biological processes (15.Cardozo T. Pagano M. The SCF ubiquitin ligase: insights into a molecular machine.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The SCF complex is composed of a catalytic core containing Skp1, Cul1, Rbx1, and an F-box protein. The small RING protein Rbx1 receives ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme, and the variable F-box protein recruits a substrate and bridges ubiquitin to the substrate (16.Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M. Mechanisms and function of substrate recruitment by F-box proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). On the basis of the specific and precise regulations of SCF E3 ligases in eliminating substrates, SCF components have recently attracted significant attention in cancer therapeutic drug development (17.Wang Z. Liu P. Inuzuka H. Wei W. Roles of F-box proteins in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 18.Weathington N.M. Mallampalli R.K. Emerging therapies targeting the ubiquitin proteasome system in cancer.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). F-box proteins contain an NH2-terminal 40-amino acid F-box domain that binds Skp1 to create a link to Cul1-Rbxl. On the basis of the carboxyl-terminal domain, F-box proteins are classified as an L subfamily (containing a leucine-rich repeat motif), a W subfamily (containing a WD repeat motif) and an O subfamily (F-box only) (19.Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Identification of a family of human F-box proteins.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). F-box proteins recognize diverse substrates through the leucine-rich repeat/WD motif. Identifying the interaction between an F-box protein and its substrates has led to an improved understanding of how SCF E3 ligases mediate multiple biological functions, including gene expression, mitotic cell cycle progression, and inflammation. A recently characterized F-box protein, Fbxl7 has been shown to regulate mitosis through targeting Aurora A kinase for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, which plays vital roles in mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation (20.Coon T.A. Glasser J.R. Mallampalli R.K. Chen B.B. Novel E3 ligase component FBXL7 ubiquitinates and degrades Aurora A, causing mitotic arrest.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that Fbxl7 displays proapoptotic activity (20.Coon T.A. Glasser J.R. Mallampalli R.K. Chen B.B.

However, the nature of the molecular target for this F-box protein remained obscure. Because mitochondria play central roles in initiating apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, we hypothesized that Fbxl7 mediates the disposal of an antiapoptotic protein that leads to impaired mitochondrial function. In a screening analysis, we identified that Fbxl7 recruits the antiapoptotic protein survivin for its polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation.

Fbxl7 rabbit antibody was from Novus (Littleton, CO). Purified Cul1, Rbx1, and Skp1 were from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). Purified ubiquitin, E1, E2, and ubiquitin aldehyde were from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Cycloheximide was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Fbxl7 mouse antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation systems and the Enliten ATP assay system were from Promega (Madison, WI). PCR-based approaches were applied to clone Fbxl7 and survivin into pcDNA3.1/V5-HIS-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells using the appropriate primers. All mutants were constructed with PCR-based approaches or site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent). Plasmids were transfected into cells using nucleofection following the protocol of the manufacturer. Transfected cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red (50 nm) for 15 min following the protocols of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were washed with medium four times before harvesting with trypsin digestion. Cell suspensions were then analyzed with an AccuriC6 system with De Novo software. MitoTracker staining was measured by flow cytometry FL1 (FITC; excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 530 nm) and FL3 (MitoTracker Red; excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 610 nm). The enclosed areas represent the percentage of defective mitochondria. Whole cell extracts (normalized to total protein concentration) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to membranes, and immunoblotted. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of cell lysates (in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors) were incubated with 2 μg of Fbxl7 rabbit antibodies for 3–4 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitated complex was washed three times with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and analyzed by immunoblotting with an enhanced ECL system. The ubiquitylation of wild-type or lysine mutant survivin-HA was performed in a volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm DTT, 400 μm MG132, 2 mm ATP, 50 nm E1, 0.5 μm UbcH5, 0.5 μm UbcH7, 2 μm ubiquitin, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 20 nm Cul1, 20 nm Rbx1, 20 nm Skp1, in vitro-synthesized survivin-HA (WT or mutant), and Fbxl7 within the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. Reaction products were examined for HA immunoblotting. The microscopy analysis was performed using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a ×60 oil objective. The microscope was equipped with a Ti Perfect Focus system and Tokai Hit live cell chamber providing a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfected cells were plated at 70% confluence on 35-mm MatTek glass bottom culture dishes before being labeled with MitoTracker Red (50 nm) or JC-1 (2 μm)for 20 min. Images were analyzed by Nikon NIS-element software. Pseudocolor green was used for optimal resolution of mitochondria MitoTracker image display. The indicated plasmids were nucleofected into MLE12 cells and incubated for 36 h before analysis. ATP was assayed using an Enliten ATP assay system (Promega). Oxygen consumption in cells was measured using an XF analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences). Oligomycin (3 μm), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (0.5 μm) and rotenone (3 μm) were added sequentially to assess non-ATP linked, maximal, and non-mitochondrial respiration, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with an analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test, with p < 0.05 indicative of significance. As we reported previously (20.Coon T.A. Glasser J.R. Mallampalli R.K. Chen B.B. Novel E3 ligase component FBXL7 ubiquitinates and degrades Aurora A, causing mitotic arrest.Cell Cycle. 2012; 11: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), ectopically expressed Fbxl7 induces apoptosis in cells. To further decode the underlying mechanism, we tested whether Fbxl7 affected mitochondrial function. In Fig. 1A, flow cytometry-based MitoTracker staining revealed that the ectopically expressed plasmid encoding Fbxl7 in MLE cells induces mitochondrial damage in a dose-dependent manner. Fbxl7 protein expression was examined by immunoblotting showing high levels in cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We further compared mitochondrion morphology in cells transfected with either control empty vector or an Fbxl7 plasmid. As a control, the mitochondrial membrane depolarizer CCCP induced formation of punctate-like signals of mitochondria instead of the reticular or more linear form observed in healthy control cells (Fig. 1B). Overexpressed Fbxl7 triggered mitochondrial changes comparable with CCCP treatment. Mitochondrial health is affected by the ability of these organelles to remodel through fusion. Mitochondrial fusion is mediated partly by the outer mitochondrial membrane fusion protein mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). CCCP treatment decreased Mfn1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Compared with a control vector and an F-box domain-deficient Fbxl7 plasmid that lacks the ability to form a SCF E3 ligase, overexpression of wild-type Fbxl7 in cells reduced Mfn1 protein levels 36%, similar to the effects of CCCP treatment (Fig. 1C). To further link these mitochondrial structural changes induced by Fbxl7 with a physiologic readout, we measured the membrane potential (ΔΨ) in Fbxl7 overexpression cells using JC-1 (Fig. 1D). JC-1 dye displays potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from green (∼529 nm) to red (∼590 nm). Therefore, mitochondrial depolarization is indicated by a decrease in the red/green fluorescence ratio. Similar to CCCP-treated cells, Fbxl7-overexpressed cells showed significant changes in membrane potential, indicative of bioenergetic changes in comparison with control cells. Additionally, increasing amounts of ectopically expressed Fbxl7 also reduced ATP levels in cells, as shown in Fig. 1E. We further confirmed the effects of Fbxl7 on mitochondrial function in cells depleted of Fbxl7 (Fig. 1F). Compared with severe mitochondrial injury observed in cells exposed to CCCP and transfected with a control scrambled shRNA, Fbxl7 depletion in cells largely protected mitochondria from mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by CCCP (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that Fbxl7 dose-dependently induces mitochondrial dysfunction. As a component of the SCF type ubiquitin E3 ligase, Fbxl7 recruits substrates for ubiquitylation and degradation. To interpret the mechanism underlying the Fbxl7 adverse effects on mitochondrial function, we performed a substrate screening assay after overexpressing the Fbxl7 plasmid in cells and measuring stress- and apoptosis-signaling substrates. We identified that high Fbxl7 protein levels were sufficient to decrease survivin protein abundance but had no effects on other mitochondrial proteins, such as Bad or caspase 3 (data not shown). Because survivin affects the fission of mitochondria (9.Hagenbuchner J. Kuznetsov A.V. Obexer P. Ausserlechner M.J. BIRC5/Survivin enhances aerobic glycolysis and drug resistance by altered regulation of the mitochondrial fusion/fission machinery.Oncogene. 2013; 32: 4748-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we next investigated how this protein affects mitochondrial function. We first screened survivin shRNA knockdown efficiency for functional studies (Fig. 2A). Survivin shRNA 1 and 4 sufficiently decreased the protein levels of survivin. However, these shRNAs had no effect on Cul1 and Skp1 protein abundance. JC-1 staining demonstrated that effective knockdown of survivin significantly increased the green/red fluorescence ratio compared with the effects of shRNAs that exhibited a limited ability to deplete survivin (survivin shRNAs 2, 3, and 5; Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C indicates that knockdown of survivin significantly decreased the oxygen consumption rate of cells, suggesting that survivin knockdown injures the capacity of mitochondrial respiration. MitoTracker staining combined with flow cytometric measurements demonstrated that survivin knockdown, compared with scrambled shRNA, results in mitochondrial impairment (Fig. 2D). Compared with cells transfected with control scrambled shRNA, the cells depleted with survivin displayed distorted punctate-like mitochondria (Fig. 2E). These results show that knockdown of survivin displays a mitochondrial phenotype similar to the ectopically expressed Fbxl7 plasmid in cells. The results led us to investigate how Fbxl7 targets survivin for its elimination in cells. To better characterize survivin protein, we first measured the half-life of endogenous survivin protein in lung epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) indicated that the half-life of survivin is ∼2 h. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely stabilized the decay of survivin. However, the lysosome inhibitor leupeptin did not modulate survivin degradation kinetics. These results suggest that the proteasome, rather than the lysosome, is involved in degradation of survivin. We further measured whether Fbxl7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of survivin. In in vitro ubiquitylation assays, as shown in Fig. 3B, the ubiquitin E3 ligase SCFFbxl7 catalyzed the polyubiquitylation of survivin. Furthermore, the overexpressed Fbxl7 plasmid in cells accelerated the degradation of endogenous survivin over time. However, overexpression of an Fbxl7 F-box deletion mutant had no effect on the half-life of endogenous survivin protein (Fig. 3C). Additionally, increasing amounts of ectopically expressed Fbxl7 plasmid resulted in a decrease in survivin protein levels (Fig. 3D). However, other randomly selected F-box proteins, Fbxo16 and Fbxo17, had no effects on survivin protein abundance. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Fbxl7 also reduced survivin protein levels in other cell lines of epithelial origin (colon, cervical, and human airway cells), suggesting that the behavior of this F-box protein is not restricted to lung epithelia (Fig. 3E). To further confirm that Fbxl7 down-regulates survivin protein abundance, we screened a group of Fbxl7 shRNAs. Fig. 3F suggests that effective knockdown of Fbxl7 largely accumulates endogenous survivin protein. However the depletion of Fbxl7 had little influence on the proteins Cul1 and Skp1. Additionally, knockdown of Fbxl7 extended the lifespan of endogenous survivin (Fig. 3, G and H). As a whole, these data indicate that Fbxl7 mediates the polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of survivin. F-box proteins are recruited to their substrates using distinct molecular signatures. To dissect the Fbxl7 docking site with survivin, we constructed a series of amino- and carboxyl-truncated survivin expression plasmids, as shown in Fig. 4A. Survivin C-terminal deletion mutants displayed obvious binding deficiencies to Fbxl7 in coimmunoprecipitation assays. The most distal C-terminal 22 amino acids are important for Fbxl7 binding because, in pulldowns, survivin mutants (CD22–62) largely failed to interact with Fbxl7 (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, top blot). We then focused on this stretch of C-terminal residues within survivin to further narrow down the Fbxl7-interacting site, demonstrating that progressive loss of the 17–22 carboxyl-terminal residues resulted in reduced Fbxl7 binding, suggesting that these residues were required for optimal interaction between the F-box protein and survivin (Fig. 4B). Specifically, glutamic acid 126 within survivin was required for Fbxl7 binding (Fig. 4C). In protein half-life assays, the expression of plasmids encoding WT, E126A, or T127A survivin mutants was tested for stability (Fig. 4D), and densitometric analysis was performed (Fig. 4E). We confirmed that the Fbxl7 binding-defective E126A survivin mutant protein was more stable than the other constructs. These results show that the Glu-126 site functions as a key molecular recognition site for Fbxl7 binding. To identify the ubiquitin acceptor site within survivin, we ectopically expressed survivin plasmids encoding point mutations at one or two lysine sites within the protein in cells. However, as shown in Fig. 5A, with CHX treatment, none of the single lysine mutants could stabilize the decay of survivin. On the basis of the crystal structure of survivin (PDB code 1F3H), we further constructed a series of survivin double lysine mutants. Specifically, to exclude the influence of another protease, we coexpressed Fbxl7 and a survivin lysine mutant in cells to compare the protein levels in cells coexpressed with control empty vector versus a lysine mutant. Fig. 5B demonstrates that a dual lysine mutant, K90R/K91R, was significantly stabilized against the Fbxl7-mediated degradation of survivin. To further rule out potential effects of a V5 tag (containing a lysine), we also tested the survivin turnover rate with the lysine-free HA tag. As shown in Fig. 5C, a double lysine mutant, K90R/K91R, largely exhibited delayed degradation compared with the wild type or the other dual lysine mutant, K129R/K130R. The results were quantitated and are shown in Fig. 5D. The in vitro ubiquitylation assays shown in Fig. 5E confirmed that a double lysine mutant, K90R/K91R, displayed resistance to Fbxl7-dependent ubiquitylation. However, as shown in Fig. 5F, the survivin double lysine mutations had no effect on the interaction between Fbxl7 and survivin. These results suggest that both Lys-90 and Lys-91 are critical for Fbxl7-mediated polyubiquitylation. In cells overexpressing Fbxl7, MitoTracker staining shows that the percentage of defective mitochondria increases significantly (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 6A), as quantified in Fig. 6B. However, coexpression of wild-type survivin together with Fbxl7 or an Fbxl7 survivin binding mutant (E126A) partially rescues the mitochondrial defect induced by the F-box protein (Fig. 6B). We also observed that expression of the ubiquitylation-resistant survivin dual lysine mutant K90R/K91R protects mitochondria from overexpressed Fbxl7 effects to a larger extent compared with wild-type survivin. We also measured the ATP levels in cells transfected with these plasmids. Consistent with our observations on the basis of MitoTracker staining, Fbxl7 overexpression caused a significant decrease in cellular ATP levels. However, co-overexpression of survivin largely counteracts these adverse effects on energy stores in cells overexpressing Fbxl7. Specifically, expression of a degradation-resistant survivin lysine mutant displayed a greater degree of protection against injurious effects of Fbxl7 overexpression cells compared with wild-type survivin (Fig. 6C). To specifically monitor mitochondrial function further, we measured the oxygen consumption rate with a seahorse XF analyzer. As shown in Fig. 6D, the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate decreased significantly in Fbxl7-overexpressed cells. Additional exogenous expression of survivin compensated for the mitochondrial respiration defect induced by Fbxl7 overexpression. An Fbxl7 binding-deficient survivin plasmid (E126A) mutant, when expressed in cells, also displayed a greater capacity than wild-type survivin to rescue the respiratory deficiency triggered by overexpression of Fbxl7.

QhpD is essential for the formation of intra-protein thioether bonds within the small subunit (maturated QhpC) of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase. We overproduced QhpD from Paracoccus denitrificans as a stable complex with its substrate QhpC, carrying the 28-residue leader peptide that is essential for the complex formation. Absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra together with the analyses of iron and sulfur contents suggested the presence of multiple (likely three) [4Fe-4S] clusters in the purified and reconstituted QhpD. In the presence of a reducing agent (sodium dithionite), QhpD catalyzed the multiple-turnover reaction of reductive cleavage of SAM into methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine and also the single-turnover reaction of intra-protein sulfur-to-methylene carbon thioether bond formation in QhpC bound to QhpD, producing a multiknotted structure of the polypeptide chain. Homology modeling and mutagenic analysis revealed several conserved residues indispensable for both in vivo and in vitro activities of QhpD. Our findings uncover another challenging reaction catalyzed by a radical SAM enzyme acting on a ribosomally translated protein substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1999057987,"Retinal vein occlusion is a leading cause of visual impairment. Experimental models of this condition based on laser photocoagulation of retinal veins have been described and extensively exploited in mammals and larger rodents such as the rat. However, few reports exist on the use of this paradigm in the mouse. The objective of this study was to investigate a model of branch and central retinal vein occlusion in the mouse and characterize in vivo longitudinal retinal morphology alterations using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal veins were experimentally occluded using laser photocoagulation after intravenous application of Rose Bengal, a photo-activator dye enhancing thrombus formation. Depending on the number of veins occluded, variable amounts of capillary dropout were seen on fluorescein angiography. Vascular endothelial growth factor levels were markedly elevated early and peaked at day one. Retinal thickness measurements with spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed significant swelling (p<0.001) compared to baseline, followed by gradual thinning plateauing two weeks after the experimental intervention (p<0.001). Histological findings at day seven correlated with spectral domain optical coherence tomography imaging. The inner layers were predominantly affected by degeneration with the outer nuclear layer and the photoreceptor outer segments largely preserved. The application of this retinal vein occlusion model in the mouse carries several advantages over its use in other larger species, such as access to a vast range of genetically modified animals. Retinal changes after experimental retinal vein occlusion in this mouse model can be non-invasively quantified by spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and may be used to monitor effects of potential therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2039123211,"Across their introduced range in North America, populations of feral honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies have supposedly declined in recent decades as a result of exotic parasites, most notably the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. Nonetheless, recent studies have documented several wild populations of colonies that have persisted. The extreme polyandry of honey bee queens—and the increased intracolony genetic diversity it confers—has been attributed, in part, to improved disease resistance and may be a factor in the survival of these populations of feral colonies. We estimated the mating frequencies of queens in feral colonies in the Arnot Forest in New York State to determine if the level of polyandry of these queens is especially high and so might contribute to their survival success. We genotyped the worker offspring from 10 feral colonies in the Arnot Forest of upstate New York, as well as those from 20 managed colonies closest to this forest. We found no significant differences in mean mating frequency between the feral and managed queens, suggesting that queens in the remote, low-density population of colonies in the Arnot Forest are neither mate-limited nor adapted to mate at an especially high frequency. These findings support the hypothesis that the hyperpolyandry of honey bees has been shaped on an evolutionary timescale rather than on an ecological one."
https://openalex.org/W2322474005,"Male infertility affects approximately 50% of all infertile couples. The male-related causes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection failure include the absence of sperm, immotile or immature sperm, and sperm with structural defects such as those caused by premature chromosomal condensation and DNA damage. Our previous studies based on a knockout mice model indicated that SEPT12 proteins are critical for the terminal morphological formation of sperm. SEPT12 mutations in men result in teratozospermia and oligozospermia. In addition, the spermatozoa exhibit morphological defects of the head and tail, premature chromosomal condensation, and nuclear damage. However, the molecular functions of SEPT12 during spermatogenesis remain unclear. To determine the molecular functions of SEPT12, we applied a yeast 2-hybrid system to identify SEPT12 interactors. Seven proteins that interact with SEPT12 were identified: SEPT family proteins (SEPT4 and SEPT6), nuclear or nuclear membrane proteins (protamine 2, sperm-associated antigen 4, and NDC1 transmembrane nucleoproine), and sperm-related structural proteins (pericentriolar material 1 and obscurin-like 1). Sperm-associated antigen 4 (SPAG4; also known as SUN4) belongs to the SUN family of proteins and acts as a linker protein between nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton proteins and localizes in the nuclear membrane. We determined that SEPT12 interacts with SPAG4 in a male germ cell line through coimmunoprecipitation. During human spermiogenesis, SEPT12 is colocalized with SPAG4 near the nuclear periphery in round spermatids and in the centrosome region in elongating spermatids. Furthermore, we observed that SEPT12/SPAG4/LAMINB1 formed complexes and were coexpressed in the nuclear periphery of round spermatids. In addition, mutated SEPT12, which was screened from an infertile man, affected the integration of these nuclear envelope complexes through coimmunoprecipitation. This was the first study that suggested that SEPT proteins link to the SUN/LAMIN complexes during the formation of nuclear envelopes and are involved in the development of postmeiotic germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1963792223,"Objectives We have analyzed the parameters (bacterial translocation, immune activation and regulation, presence of HCV coinfection) which could be implicated in an inappropriate immune response from individuals with chronic HIV infection. The influence of them on the evolution of CD4+ T cell count has been investigated. Patients and methods Seventy HIV-infected patients [monoinfected by HIV (n = 20), HCV-coinfected (with (n = 25) and without (n = 25) liver cirrhosis)] and 25 healthy controls were included. Median duration of HIV infection was 20 years. HIV- and HCV-related parameters, as well as markers relative to bacterial translocation, monocyte and lymphocyte activation and regulation were considered as independent variables. Dependent variables were the increase of CD4+ T cell count during the follow-up (12 months). Results Increased values of bacterial translocation, measured by lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, monocyte and lymphocyte activation markers and T regulatory lymphocytes were detected in HIV-monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients. Serum sCD14 and IL-6 were increased in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with liver cirrhosis in comparison with those with chronic hepatitis or HIV-monoinfected individuals. Time with undetectable HIV load was not related with these parameters. The presence of cirrhosis was negatively associated with a CD4+ T cell count increase. Conclusion In patients with a chronic HIV infection, a persistent increase of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and monocyte and lymphocyte modifications are present. HCV-related cirrhosis is associated with more elevated serum concentrations of monocyte-derived markers. Cirrhosis influences the continued immune reconstitution of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2056284802,"Overactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in adult tissues has been implicated in many diseases, such as colorectal cancer. Finding chemical substances that can prevent this phenomenon is an emerging problem. Recently, several natural compounds have been described as Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors and might be promising agents for the control of carcinogenesis. Here, we describe two natural substances, derricin and derricidin, belonging to the chalcone subclass, that show potent transcriptional inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Both chalcones are able to affect the cell distribution of β-catenin, and inhibit Wnt-specific reporter activity in HCT116 cells and in Xenopus embryos. Derricin and derricidin also strongly inhibited canonical Wnt activity in vitro, and rescued the Wnt-induced double axis phenotype in Xenopus embryos. As a consequence of Wnt/β-catenin inhibition, derricin and derricidin treatments reduce cell viability and lead to cell cycle arrest in colorectal cancer cell lines. Taken together, our results strongly support these chalcones as novel negative modulators of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and colon cancer cell growth in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2015036539,"Shank and GKAP are scaffold proteins and binding partners at the postsynaptic density (PSD). The distribution and dynamics of Shank and GKAP were studied in dissociated hippocampal cultures by pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy. Antibodies against epitopes containing their respective mutual binding sites were used to verify the expected juxtapositioning of Shank and GKAP. If all Shank and GKAP molecules at the PSD were bound to each other, the distribution of label for the two proteins should coincide. However, labels for the mutual binding sites showed significant differences in distribution, with a narrow distribution for GKAP located close to the postsynaptic membrane, and a wider distribution for Shank extending deeper into the cytoplasm. Upon depolarization with high K+, neither the intensity nor distribution of label for GKAP changed, but labeling intensity for Shank at the PSD increased to ~150% of controls while the median distance of label from postsynaptic membrane increased by 7.5 nm. These results indicate a preferential recruitment of Shank to more distal parts of the PSD complex. Conversely, upon incubation in Ca2+-free medium containing EGTA, the labeling intensity of Shank at the PSD decreased to ~70% of controls and the median distance of label from postsynaptic membrane decreased by 9 nm, indicating a preferential loss of Shank molecules in more distal parts of the PSD complex. These observations identify two pools of Shank at the PSD complex, one relatively stable pool, closer to the postsynaptic membrane that can bind to GKAP, and another more dynamic pool at a location too far away to bind to GKAP."

Some of these proteins may have potential for vaccine development. Pvs48/45 is a P. vivax gametocyte surface antigen orthologous to Pfs48/45, which may play a role during parasite fertilization and thus has potential for transmission blocking (TB) activity. Here we describe the expression of a recombinant Pvs48/45 protein expressed in Escherichia coli as a ∼60kDa construct which we tested for antigenicity using human sera and for its immunogenicity and transmission blocking activity of specific anti-mouse and anti-monkey Pvs48/45 antibodies. The protein reacted with sera of individuals from malaria-endemic areas and in addition induced specific IgG antibody responses in BALB/c mice and Aotus l. griseimembra monkeys. Sera from both immunized animal species recognized native P. vivax protein in Western blot (WB) and immunofluorescence assays. Moreover, sera from immunized mice and monkeys produced significant inhibition of parasite transmission to An. Albimanus mosquitoes as shown by membrane feeding assays. Results indicate the presence of reactive epitopes in the Pvs48/45 recombinant product that induce antibodies with TB activity. Further testing of this protein is ongoing to determine its vaccine potential."
https://openalex.org/W2029719809,"Background Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, is expressed in bone, more specifically, the periosteum and periodontal ligaments, and plays a key role in formation and metabolism of bone tissues. Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs) have been reported to differentiate into osteoblasts and stimulate bone repair. However, the role of periostin in hASC-mediated bone healing has not been clarified. In the current study, we examined the effect of periostin on bone healing capacity of hASCs in a critical size calvarial defect model. Methods and Results Recombinant periostin protein stimulated migration, adhesion, and proliferation of hASCs in vitro. Implantation of either hASCs or periostin resulted in slight, but not significant, stimulation of bone healing, whereas co-implantation of hASCs together with periostin further potentiated bone healing. In addition, the number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells was significantly increased in calvarial defects by co-implantation of both hASCs and periostin. Consistently, proliferation of administered hASCs was stimulated by co-implantation with periostin in vivo. In addition, co-delivery of hASCs with periostin resulted in markedly increased numbers of CD31-positive endothelial cells and α-SMA-positive arterioles in calvarial defects. Conclusions These results suggest that recombinant periostin potentiates hASC-mediated bone healing by stimulating proliferation of transplanted hASCs and angiogenesis in calvarial defects."
https://openalex.org/W2046686522,"Integrin engagement on lymphocytes initiates outside-in signaling that is required for cytoskeleton remodeling and the formation of the synaptic interface. However, the mechanism by which the outside-in signal contributes to receptor-mediated intracellular signaling that regulates the kinetics of granule delivery and efficiency of cytolytic activity is not well understood. We have found that variations in ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells influence killing kinetics of these cells by CD16.NK-92 cytolytic effectors suggesting that changes in integrin ligation on the effector cells regulate the kinetics of cytolytic activity by the effector cells. To understand how variations of the integrin receptor ligation may alter cytolytic activity of CD16.NK-92 cells, we analyzed molecular events at the contact area of these cells exposed to planar lipid bilayers that display integrin ligands at different densities and activating CD16-specific antibodies. Changes in the extent of integrin ligation on CD16.NK-92 cells at the cell/bilayer interface revealed that the integrin signal influences the size and the dynamics of activating receptor microclusters in a Pyk2-dependent manner. Integrin-mediated changes of the intracellular signaling significantly affected the kinetics of degranulation of CD16.NK-92 cells providing evidence that integrins regulate the rate of target cell destruction in antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)."

https://openalex.org/W2005564181,"Organ regenerative ability depends on the animal species and the developmental stage. The molecular bases for variable organ regenerative ability, however, remain unknown. Previous studies have identified genes preferentially expressed in the blastema tissues in various animals, but transcriptome analysis of the isolated proliferating blastema cells has not yet been reported. In the present study, we used RNA-sequencing analysis to analyze the gene expression profile of isolated proliferating blastema cells of regenerating Xenopus laevis tadpole tails. We used flow cytometry to isolate proliferating cells, and non-proliferating blastema cells, from regenerating tadpole tails as well as proliferating tail bud cells from tail bud embryos, the latter two of which were used as control cells, based on their DNA content. Among the 28 candidate genes identified by RNA-sequencing analysis, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction identified 10 genes whose expression was enriched in regenerating tadpole tails compared with non-regenerating tadpole tails or tails from the tail bud embryos. Among them, whole mount in situ hybridization revealed that chromosome segregation 1-like and interleukin 11 were expressed in the broad area of the tail blastema, while brevican, lysyl oxidase, and keratin 18 were mainly expressed in the notochord bud in regenerating tails. We further combined whole mount in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry for the incorporated 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine to confirm that keratin 18 and interleukin 11 were expressed in the proliferating tail blastema cells. Based on the proposed functions of their homologs in other animal species, these genes might have roles in the extracellular matrix formation in the notochord bud (brevican and lysyl oxidase), cell proliferation (chromosome segregation 1-like and keratin 18), and in the maintenance of the differentiation ability of proliferating blastema cells (interleukin 11) in regenerating tadpole tails."
https://openalex.org/W2025249806,"This paper extends Alexandr Chayanov’s model of changing household demography (specifically the ratio of food consumers to food producers) and its influence on agricultural behavior so that it includes possible adverse effects of a rising ratio on nutritional status and early childhood mortality within the household. We apply the model to 35 years’ worth of longitudinal demographic and economic data collected in the irrigated-rice growing village of Na Savang in northern Laos. When appropriate controls are included for other household variables, unobserved inter-household heterogeneity, and changes in local conditions and national policy over the study period, the analysis suggests that a unit increase in the household’s consumer/producer ratio induces something like a nine-fold increase in the risk of death among household members aged less than five years. Monte Carlo simulation studies suggest that this may be an over-estimate but also that the effect is probably real and likely to be an important factor in household demography. At the very least, the results suggest that Chayanov’s model still has theoretical relevance and deserves to be revived."

Previous studies have shown that Ig-Hepta is essential for lung surfactant homeostasis, and loss of its function results in high accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins in the alveolar space. Ig-Hepta knock-out (Ig-Hepta−/−) mice also exhibit emphysema-like symptoms, including accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages (AMs), but its pathogenic mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from Ig-Hepta−/− mice contains high levels of inflammatory mediators, lipid hydroperoxides, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are produced by AMs. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species was observed in the AMs of Ig-Hepta−/− mice in an age-dependent manner. In addition, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is activated and translocated into the nuclei of the AMs of Ig-Hepta−/− mice. Release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 from the AMs was strongly inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of oxidants and NF-κB. We also found that the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 is increased in the embryonic lungs of Ig-Hepta−/− mice at 18.5 days postcoitum, when AMs are not accumulated and activated. These results suggest that Ig-Hepta plays an important role in regulating macrophage immune responses, and its deficiency leads to local inflammation in the lung, where AMs produce excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species and up-regulate MMPs through the NF-κB signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2059906675,"Existing models explaining the evolution of sexual dimorphism in the timing of emergence (SDT) in Lepidoptera assume equal mortality rates for males and females. The limiting assumption of equal mortality rates has the consequence that these models are only able to explain the evolution of emergence of males before females, i.e. protandry-the more common temporal sequence of emergence in Lepidoptera. The models fail, however, in providing adaptive explanations for the evolution of protogyny, where females emerge before males, but protogyny is not rare in insects. The assumption of equal mortality rates seems too restrictive for many insects, such as butterflies. To investigate the influence of unequal mortality rates on the evolution of SDT, we present a generalised version of a previously published model where we relax this assumption. We find that longer life-expectancy of females compared to males can indeed favour the evolution of protogyny as a fitness enhancing strategy. Moreover, the encounter rate between females and males and the sex-ratio are two important factors that also influence the evolution of optimal SDT. If considered independently for females and males the predicted strategies can be shown to be evolutionarily stable (ESS). Under the assumption of equal mortality rates the difference between the females' and males' ESS remains typically very small. However, female and male ESS may be quite dissimilar if mortality rates are different. This creates the potential for an 'evolutionary conflict' between females and males. Bagworm moths (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) provide an exemplary case where life-history attributes are such that protogyny should indeed be the optimal emergence strategy from the males' and females' perspectives: (i) Female longevity is considerably larger than that of males, (ii) encounter rates between females and males are presumably low, and (iii) females mate only once. Protogyny is indeed the general mating strategy found in the bagworm family."
https://openalex.org/W2068093777,"The serotonergic pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of impulsivity, and sensitivity to aversive outcomes may be linked to serotonin (5-HT) levels. Polymorphisms in the gene that encodes the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which have differential effects on the level of serotonin transmission, display alternate responses to aversive stimuli. However, recent studies have shown that 5-HT does not affect motor function, which suggests that the functioning of the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) does not directly affect the behavioral regulatory process itself, but instead exerts an effect via the evaluation of the potential risk associated with particular behavioral outputs. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of specific 5-HTTLPR genotypes on the motor regulatory process, as observed during a Go/Nogo punishment feedback task. 5-HTT gene-linked promoter polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, using lymphocytes from 61 healthy Japanese volunteers. Impulsivity was defined as the number of commission errors (responding when one should not) made during a Go/Nogo task. We found that the s/s genotype group made fewer impulsive responses, specifically under aversive conditions for committing such errors, compared to those in the s/l group, without affecting overall motor inhibition. These results suggest that 5-HTTLPRs do not directly affect the behavioral regulatory process itself, but may instead exert an effect on the evaluation of potential risk. The results also indicate that under such aversive conditions, decreased expression of 5-HTT may promote motor inhibitory control."

We show via enzymatic characterization of Trichoplax OGT/OGA and genetic rescue experiments in Drosophila melanogaster that these proteins possess activities/functions similar to their bilaterian counterparts.

Overexpression of RhoGDIβ induces stress fibers of F-actin by a process involving phosphomyosin light chain, indicating that cytoskeletal tension regulated by RhoGDIβ contributes to determining adipocyte versus myocyte commitment. Furthermore, the overexpression of RacV12 (constitutively active form of Rac1) totally rescues the inhibition of adipocyte commitment by RhoGDIβ, simultaneously preventing formation of the smooth muscle-like phenotype and disrupting the stress fibers in cells overexpressing RhoGDIβ.

https://openalex.org/W2026876383,"Due to the potential of compact imaging systems with magnified spatial resolution and contrast, cone-beam x-ray differential phase-contrast computed tomography (DPC-CT) has attracted significant interest. The current proposed FDK reconstruction algorithm with the Hilbert imaginary filter will induce severe cone-beam artifacts when the cone-beam angle becomes large. In this paper, we propose an algebraic iterative reconstruction (AIR) method for cone-beam DPC-CT and report its experiment results. This approach considers the reconstruction process as the optimization of a discrete representation of the object function to satisfy a system of equations that describes the cone-beam DPC-CT imaging modality. Unlike the conventional iterative algorithms for absorption-based CT, it involves the derivative operation to the forward projections of the reconstructed intermediate image to take into account the differential nature of the DPC projections. This method is based on the algebraic reconstruction technique, reconstructs the image ray by ray, and is expected to provide better derivative estimates in iterations. This work comprises a numerical study of the algorithm and its experimental verification using a dataset measured with a three-grating interferometer and a mini-focus x-ray tube source. It is shown that the proposed method can reduce the cone-beam artifacts and performs better than FDK under large cone-beam angles. This algorithm is of interest for future cone-beam DPC-CT applications."

We therefore investigated the association between the CLOCK 3111T/C single nucleotide polymorphism and the Period3 (PER3) variable-number tandem-repeat polymorphism (either 4 or 5 repeats 54 nt in length) with morning gastric motility.Lifestyle questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were performed with 173 female volunteers (mean age, 19.4 years). Gastric motility, evaluated by electrogastrography (EGG), blood pressure, and heart rate levels were measured at 8:30 a.m. after an overnight fast. For gastric motility, the spectral powers (% normal power) and dominant frequency (DF, peak of the power spectrum) of the EGG were evaluated. The CLOCK and PER3 polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.Subjects with the CLOCK C allele (T/C or C/C genotypes: n = 59) showed a significantly lower DF (mean, 2.56 cpm) than those with the T/T genotype (n = 114, 2.81 cpm, P < 0.05). Subjects with the longer PER3 allele (PER34/5 or PER35/5 genotypes: n = 65) also showed a significantly lower DF (2.55 cpm) than those with the shorter PER34/4 genotype (n = 108, 2.83 cpm, P < 0.05). Furthermore, subjects with both the T/C or C/C and PER34/5 or PER35/5 genotypes showed a significantly lower DF (2.43 cpm, P < 0.05) than subjects with other combinations of the alleles (T/T and PER34/4 genotype, T/C or C/C and PER34/4 genotypes, and T/T and PER34/5 or PER35/5 genotypes).These results suggest that minor polymorphisms of the circadian rhythm genes CLOCK and PER3 may be associated with poor morning gastric motility, and may have a combinatorial effect. The present findings may offer a new viewpoint on the role of circadian rhythm genes on the peripheral circadian systems, including the time-keeping function of the gut."
https://openalex.org/W1995122292,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system has proven to be an efficient gene-editing tool for genome modification of cells and organisms. However, the applicability and efficiency of this system in pig embryos have not been studied in depth. Here, we aimed to remove porcine OCT4 function as a model case using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Injection of Cas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) against OCT4 decreased the percentages of OCT4-positive embryos to 37-50% of total embryos, while ~100% of control embryos exhibited clear OCT4 immunostaining. We assessed the mutation status near the guide sequence using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, and a portion of blastocysts (20% in exon 2 and 50% in exon 5) had insertions/deletions near protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs). Different target sites had frequent deletions, but different concentrations of sgRNA made no impact. OCT4 mRNA levels dramatically decreased at the 8-cell stage, and they were barely detectable in blastocysts, while mRNA levels of other genes, including NANOG, and CDX2 were not affected. In addition, the combination of two sgRNAs led to large-scale deletion (about 1.8 kb) in the same chromosome. Next, we injected an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) vector targeting the OCT4 exon with Cas9 and sgRNA to create a knockin. We confirmed eGFP fluorescence in blastocysts in the inner cell mass, and also checked the mutation status using PCR and DNA sequencing. A significant portion of blastocysts had eGFP sequence insertions near PAM sites. The CRISPR/CAS9 system provides a good tool for gene functional studies by deleting target genes in the pig."
https://openalex.org/W2108798732,"Major depression and schizophrenia are associated with dysfunctions of serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems mainly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both serotonin and dopamine are known to modulate synaptic plasticity. 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1ARs) and dopaminergic type D1 receptors are highly represented on dendritic spines of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PyNs) in PFC. How these receptors interact to tune plasticity is poorly understood. Here we show that D1-like receptors (D1Rs) activation requires functional 5HT1ARs to facilitate LTP induction at the expense of LTD. Using 129/Sv and 5-HT1AR-KO mice, we recorded post-synaptic currents evoked by electrical stimulation in layer 2/3 after activation or inhibition of D1Rs. High frequency stimulation resulted in the induction of LTP, LTD or no plasticity. The D1 agonist markedly enhanced the NMDA current in 129/Sv mice and the percentage of L5PyNs displaying LTP was enhanced whereas LTD was reduced. In 5-HT1AR-KO mice, the D1 agonist failed to increase the NMDA current and orientated the plasticity towards L5PyNs displaying LTD, thus revealing a prominent role of 5-HT1ARs in dopamine-induced modulation of plasticity. Our data suggest that in pathological situation where 5-HT1ARs expression varies, dopaminergic treatment used for its ability to increase LTP could turn to be less and less effective."
https://openalex.org/W2113556313,"Background Data on sex-specific differences in sound production, acoustic behaviour and hearing abilities in fishes are rare. Representatives of numerous catfish families are known to produce sounds in agonistic contexts (intraspecific aggression and interspecific disturbance situations) using their pectoral fins. The present study investigates differences in agonistic behaviour, sound production and hearing abilities in males and females of a callichthyid catfish. Methodology/Principal Findings Eight males and nine females of the armoured catfish Megalechis thoracata were investigated. Agonistic behaviour displayed during male-male and female-female dyadic contests and sounds emitted were recorded, sound characteristics analysed and hearing thresholds measured using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique. Male pectoral spines were on average 1.7-fold longer than those of same-sized females. Visual and acoustic threat displays differed between sexes. Males produced low-frequency harmonic barks at longer distances and thumps at close distances, whereas females emitted broad-band pulsed crackles when close to each other. Female aggressive sounds were significantly shorter than those of males (167 ms versus 219 to 240 ms) and of higher dominant frequency (562 Hz versus 132 to 403 Hz). Sound duration and sound level were positively correlated with body and pectoral spine length, but dominant frequency was inversely correlated only to spine length. Both sexes showed a similar U-shaped hearing curve with lowest thresholds between 0.2 and 1 kHz and a drop in sensitivity above 1 kHz. The main energies of sounds were located at the most sensitive frequencies. Conclusions/Significance Current data demonstrate that both male and female M. thoracata produce aggressive sounds, but the behavioural contexts and sound characteristics differ between sexes. Sexes do not differ in hearing, but it remains to be clarified if this is a general pattern among fish. This is the first study to describe sex-specific differences in agonistic behaviour in fishes."

We investigate 3-year changes in individual body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Methods In the Population Health Survey, 7084 adults in 2003 (baseline) were followed up in 2006. Longitudinal anthropometric data were available in 2941 (41.5%) for BMI and 2956 for waist circumference. Weight status and central obesity were based on objectively measured BMI and waist circumference using Asian standards. Results Mean BMI (SD) increased from 22.8 (3.62) to 23.1 (3.95) (p<0.001) with 1.3 percentage point increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity (from 44.3% to 45.6%). One in 5 (22.0%) normal or underweight baseline respondents became overweight or obese and a similar proportion (24.8%) of overweight and obese respondents became normal or underweight. Prevalence of central obesity increased from 28.3% to 32.4% (p<0.001) with a non-significantly greater increase in women (30.0% to 38.1%) than men (23.0% to 26.1%) (p=0.63). A higher proportion of centrally obese respondents returned to normal (29.4%) than normal respondents developing central obesity (17.4%). Conclusions This is one of the few studies in Chinese, which found dynamic longitudinal changes (increase/stable/decrease) in individual weight status and waist circumference. Future studies with better follow-up and investigating the causes of such changes are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2077622516,"Although stochastic and deterministic processes have been found to jointly shape structure of natural communities, the relative importance of both forces may vary across different environmental conditions and across levels of biological organization. We tested the effects of abiotic environmental conditions, altered trophic interactions and dispersal limitation on the structure of aquatic microfauna communities in Costa Rican tank bromeliads. Our approach combined natural gradients in environmental conditions with experimental manipulations of bottom-up interactions (resources), top-down interactions (predators) and dispersal at two spatial scales in the field. We found that resource addition strongly increased the abundance and reduced the richness of microfauna communities. Community composition shifted in a predictable way towards assemblages dominated by flagellates and ciliates but with lower abundance and richness of algae and amoebae. While all functional groups responded strongly and predictably to resource addition, similarity among communities at the species level decreased, suggesting a role of stochasticity in species-level assembly processes. Dispersal limitation did not affect the communities. Since our design excluded potential priority effects we can attribute the differences in community similarity to increased demographic stochasticity of resource-enriched communities related to erratic changes in population sizes of some species. In contrast to resources, predators and environmental conditions had negligible effects on community structure. Our results demonstrate that bromeliad microfauna communities are strongly controlled by bottom-up forces. They further suggest that the relative importance of stochasticity may change with productivity and with the organizational level at which communities are examined."
https://openalex.org/W2034603061,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common and severe type of dystrophinopathy, is an X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, which leads to fragility and vulnerability of the sarcolemma to mechanical stretching with increased membrane permeability. Currently, glucocorticoids such as prednisolone are the only medication available for DMD. However, molecular pathways responsible for this effect are still unclear. In addition, it remains unclear whether sex-related factors, including pregnancy and the postpartum period, affect the phenotype of dystrophinopathy. Here, we report the amelioration of muscle membrane permeability in the diaphragm muscle of pregnant and postpartum, but not in nulliparous, mdx mice, an animal model for DMD, during the physiological surge of corticosterone, the most abundant glucocorticoid in rodents. Cultures of single muscle fibers and myotubes isolated from mdx mouse diaphragm demonstrate resistance to hypo-osmotic shock when treated with corticosterone but not with estradiol or progesterone. This corticosterone-mediated resistance was diminished by an antagonist of corticosterone, indicating that the glucocorticoid-glucocorticoid receptor axis plays a role in this membrane stabilization effect on muscle. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of corticosterone into mdx mice showed decreased membrane permeability. This is the first report to demonstrate that pregnancy-related resistance to muscle fiber damage in mdx mice due to the membrane stabilization effect of corticosterone. We also propose that this membrane stabilization effect is exerted through annexin A1 up-regulation as the molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid effects on DMD muscle. Furthermore, single muscle fiber culture studies provide a sensitive chemical screening platform for muscular dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W1964354825,"Purpose A primary task of the eye care professional is determining the refraction, or optical correction, of a patient. The duochrome red-green test is a standard tool for verification of the final refraction. Traditionally, it is recommended for use both prior to and subsequent to determining the cylindrical or astigmatic component of the refraction. In order for it to be effective when used before correcting the cylinder it is necessary that the COLC (Circle of Least Confusion) be on the retina. This study examined whether it is necessarily true that the duochrome response in uncorrected astigmatism will be as trust-worthy as it is with corrected cylinders. Methods The red-green examination was performed monocularly under the following three conditions: a. fully corrected refraction for the subgroup of eyes that had spherical refractions and for the subgroup of eyes with sphero-cylindrical refractions. b. best sphere-only correction without cylinder correction in sphero-cylindrical eyes c. an induced cylinder error in spherical eyes. The interval between the last “red” response and the first “green” response for the right eyes as a group and separately for the physiological cylinder and induced cylinder correction sub-groups was calculated and compared using a paired, two-tailed t-test. Results The intervals between “red” and “green” responses were not significantly different in the population as a whole and in the uncorrected physiological cylinder and induced cylinder subgroups examined. Conclusion Based on the finding that the interval of red-green equality with fully corrected cylinder and without the cylindrical correction are not significantly different, the red-green duochrome test can indeed be used both before and after cylindrical correction."
https://openalex.org/W2046595655,"The aim of the present study was to elucidate the adaptive and de-adaptive nature of human running on a split-belt treadmill. The degree of adaptation and de-adaptation was compared with those in walking by calculating the antero-posterior component of the ground reaction force (GRF). Adaptation to walking and running on a split-belt resulted in a prominent asymmetry in the movement pattern upon return to the normal belt condition, while the two components of the GRF showed different behaviors depending on the gaits. The anterior braking component showed prominent adaptive and de-adaptive behaviors in both gaits. The posterior propulsive component, on the other hand, exhibited such behavior only in running, while that in walking showed only short-term aftereffect (lasting less than 10 seconds) accompanied by largely reactive responses. These results demonstrate a possible difference in motor strategies (that is, the use of reactive feedback and adaptive feedforward control) by the central nervous system (CNS) for split-belt locomotor adaptation between walking and running. The present results provide basic knowledge on neural control of human walking and running as well as possible strategies for gait training in athletic and rehabilitation scenes."

Methods This study evaluated a retrospective cohort of 436 CTD patients admitted to a large teaching hospital in Zhejiang province, China, along with an additional 436 participants of an annual community health screening conducted in the physical examination center who served as age- and gender-matched controls. Demographic, clinical, serologic and imaging characteristics, as well as medications used by each participant were recorded. Cardiovascular involvement was defined by uniform criteria. Correlations between clinical/serologic factors and cardiovascular involvement were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results CTD patients had a significantly higher cardiovascular involvement rate than controls (64.7% vs 23.4%), with higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, elevated systolic and diastolic pressures, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lower albumin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, CTP patients with cardiovascular involvement were significantly older, had higher systolic and diastolic pressures, C-reactive protein, glucose, and uric acid, higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, and use of moderate- to high-dose glucocorticoids, and longer disease duration compared to patients without involvement (all p < 0.05). Moreover, CTD in patients with cardiovascular involvement was more likely to be complicated by ILD (p < 0.01), which manifested as a higher alveolar inflammation score (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, cardiovascular involvement in CTD patients was associated with age, systolic pressure, body mass index, uric acid, disease duration > 2 years, use of moderate- to high-dose glucocorticoids, and ILD with a high alveolar inflammation score. Conclusion Cardiovascular involvement is increased in CTD patients, and is associated with ILD with a higher alveolar inflammation score. Thus, early-stage echocardiography and CT scans should be used to detect potential cardiovascular complications in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2312658698,"Selection-based recombineering is a flexible and proven technology to precisely modify bacterial genomes at single base resolution. It consists of two steps of homologous recombination followed by selection/counter-selection. However, the shortage of efficient counter-selectable markers limits the throughput of this method. Additionally, the emergence of 'selection escapees' can affect recombinant pools generated through this method, and they must be manually removed at each step of selection-based recombineering. Here, we report a series of efforts to improve the throughput and robustness of selection-based recombineering and to achieve seamless and automatable genome engineering. Using the nucleoside kinase activity of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (hsvTK) on the non-natural nucleoside dP, a highly efficient, rapid, and liquid-based counter-selection system was established. By duplicating hsvtk gene, combined with careful control of the population size for the subsequent round, we effectively eliminated selection escapes, enabling seamless and multiple insertions/replacement of gene-size fragments in the chromosome. Four rounds of recombineering could thus be completed in 10 days, requiring only liquid handling and without any need for colony isolation or genotype confirmation. The simplicity and robustness of our method make it broadly accessible for multi-locus chromosomal modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2319498058,"Corneal abrasion not only damages the epithelium but also induces stromal keratocyte death at the site of injury. While a coordinated cascade of inflammatory cell recruitment facilitates epithelial restoration, it is unclear if this cascade is necessary for keratocyte recovery. Since platelet and neutrophil (PMN) recruitment after corneal abrasion is beneficial to epithelial wound healing, we wanted to determine if these cells play a role in regulating keratocyte repopulation after epithelial abrasion. A 2 mm diameter central epithelial region was removed from the corneas of C57BL/6 wildtype (WT), P-selectin deficient (P-sel-/-), and CD18 hypomorphic (CD18hypo) mice using the Algerbrush II. Corneas were studied at 6h intervals out to 48h post-injury to evaluate platelet and PMN cell numbers; additional corneas were studied at 1, 4, 14, and 28 days post injury to evaluate keratocyte numbers. In WT mice, epithelial abrasion induced a loss of anterior central keratocytes and keratocyte recovery was rapid and incomplete, reaching ~70% of uninjured baseline values by 4 days post-injury but no further improvement at 28 days post-injury. Consistent with a beneficial role for platelets and PMNs in wound healing, keratocyte recovery was significantly depressed at 4 days post-injury (~30% of uninjured baseline) in P-sel-/- mice, which are known to have impaired platelet and PMN recruitment after corneal abrasion. Passive transfer of platelets from WT, but not P-sel-/-, into P-sel-/- mice prior to injury restored anterior central keratocyte numbers at 4 days post-injury to P-sel-/- uninjured baseline levels. While PMN infiltration in injured CD18hypo mice was similar to injured WT mice, platelet recruitment was markedly decreased and anterior central keratocyte recovery was significantly reduced (~50% of baseline) at 4–28 days post-injury. Collectively, the data suggest platelets and platelet P-selectin are critical for efficient keratocyte recovery after corneal epithelial abrasion."
https://openalex.org/W2070178580,"The formation of a vertebrate skeletal muscle fiber involves a series of sequential and interdependent events that occurs during embryogenesis. One of these events is myoblast fusion which has been widely studied, yet not completely understood. It was previously shown that during myoblast fusion there is an increase in the expression of Na+/K+-ATPase. This fact prompted us to search for a role of the enzyme during chick in vitro skeletal myogenesis. Chick myogenic cells were treated with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain in four different concentrations (0.01-10 μM) and analyzed. Our results show that 0.01, 0.1 and 1 μM ouabain did not induce changes in cell viability, whereas 10 μM induced a 45% decrease. We also observed a reduction in the number and thickness of multinucleated myotubes and a decrease in the number of myoblasts after 10 μM ouabain treatment. We tested the involvement of MEK-ERK and p38 signaling pathways in the ouabain-induced effects during myogenesis, since both pathways have been associated with Na+/K+-ATPase. The MEK-ERK inhibitor U0126 alone did not alter cell viability and did not change ouabain effect. The p38 inhibitor SB202190 alone or together with 10 μM ouabain did not alter cell viability. Our results show that the 10 μM ouabain effects in myofiber formation do not involve the MEK-ERK or the p38 signaling pathways, and therefore are probably related to the pump activity function of the Na+/K+-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1979581280,"Protein secretion systems are extremely important in bacteria because they are involved in many fundamental cellular processes. Of the various secretion systems, the Sec system is composed of seven different subunits in bacteria, and subunit SecB brings secreted preproteins to subunit SecA, which with SecYEG and SecDF forms a complex for the translocation of secreted preproteins through the inner membrane. Because of the wide existence of Sec system across bacteria, eukaryota, and archaea, each subunit of the Sec system has a complicated evolutionary relationship. Until very recently, 5,162 SecB sequences have been documented in UniProtKB, however no phylogenetic study has been conducted on a large sampling of SecBs from bacterial Sec secretion system, and no statistical study has been conducted on such size of SecBs in order to exhaustively investigate their variances of pairwise p-distance along taxonomic lineage from kingdom to phylum, to class, to order, to family, to genus and to organism. To fill in these knowledge gaps, 3,813 bacterial SecB sequences with full taxonomic lineage from kingdom to organism covering 4 phyla, 11 classes, 41 orders, 82 families, 269 genera, and 3,744 organisms were studied. Phylogenetic analysis revealed how the SecBs evolved without compromising their function with examples of 3-D structure comparison of two SecBs from Proteobacteria, and possible factors that affected the SecB evolution were considered. The average pairwise p-distances showed that the variance varied greatly in each taxonomic group. Finally, the variance was further partitioned into inter- and intra-clan variances, which could correspond to vertical and horizontal gene transfers, with relevance for Achromobacter, Brevundimonas, Ochrobactrum, and Pseudoxanthomonas."
https://openalex.org/W2027449515,"In recent years, formalization and reasoning of topological relations have become a hot topic as a means to generate knowledge about the relations between spatial objects at the conceptual and geometrical levels. These mechanisms have been widely used in spatial data query, spatial data mining, evaluation of equivalence and similarity in a spatial scene, as well as for consistency assessment of the topological relations of multi-resolution spatial databases. The concept of computational fuzzy topological space is applied to simple fuzzy regions to efficiently and more accurately solve fuzzy topological relations. Thus, extending the existing research and improving upon the previous work, this paper presents a new method to describe fuzzy topological relations between simple spatial regions in Geographic Information Sciences (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Firstly, we propose a new definition for simple fuzzy line segments and simple fuzzy regions based on the computational fuzzy topology. And then, based on the new definitions, we also propose a new combinational reasoning method to compute the topological relations between simple fuzzy regions, moreover, this study has discovered that there are (1) 23 different topological relations between a simple crisp region and a simple fuzzy region; (2) 152 different topological relations between two simple fuzzy regions. In the end, we have discussed some examples to demonstrate the validity of the new method, through comparisons with existing fuzzy models, we showed that the proposed method can compute more than the existing models, as it is more expressive than the existing fuzzy models."

Strong evidences support that nuclear localization is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The purpose of this research was to identify differences in the localization of centromeres of chromosomes 6, 12, 18 and X in human mesenchymal stem cells depending on differentiation and cultivating time. We analyzed centromere positions in more than 4000 nuclei in 19 mesenchymal stem cell cultures before and after prolonged cultivation and after differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic directions. We found a centromere reposition of HSAX at late passages and after differentiation in osteogenic direction as well as of HSA12 and HSA18 after adipogenic differentiation. The observed changes of the nuclear structure are new nuclear characteristics of the studied cells which may reflect regulatory changes of gene expression during the studied processes."
https://openalex.org/W2019595689,"Background The patient-physician relation begins when the physician introduces himself with name and function. Most institutions request a nametag with name and function to be worn. Although nametags are consequently worn, the optimal position for the nametag is unknown. It was the purpose of this study to identify whether positioning the nametag on the right or the left chest side provides better visibility to the patient. Method and Material One hundred volunteers, blinded to the experimental setup, presented for an orthopedic consultation in a standardized manner. The nametag of the physician was randomly positioned on the left chest side and presented to 50 individuals (age 35 years (range 17 to 83)) or the right chest side and then presented to 50 other individuals (35 years (range 16 to 59)). The time of the participant noticing the nametag was documented. Subsequently, the participant was questioned concerning the relevance of a nametag and verbal self-introduction of the physician. Results 38% of the participants noticed the nametag on the right as opposed to 20% who noticed it if placed on the left upper chest (p = 0.0473). The mean time to detection was 9 (range 1–40) seconds for nametags on the right and 25.2 seconds (range 3 to 49, p = 0.006) on the left. For 87% of the participants, a nametag is expected and important and nearly all participants (96%) expected the physician to introduce himself verbally. Conclusion It is expected that a physician wears a nametag and introduce himself verbally at the first encounter. Positioning the nametag on the right chest side results in better and faster visibility."
