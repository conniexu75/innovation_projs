https://openalex.org/W2493546904,"Damaged erythrocytes accumulate in various pathological conditions, such as hemolytic anemia, anemia of inflammation, and sickle cell disease. In mice challenged with damaged erythorcytes, a monocyte subset migrates to the liver (but not to the spleen), and this subset differentiates into a transient macrophage population that removes the damaged erythrocytes, thus preventing organ damage. Iron is an essential component of the erythrocyte protein hemoglobin and is crucial to oxygen transport in vertebrates. In the steady state, erythrocyte production is in equilibrium with erythrocyte removal1. In various pathophysiological conditions, however, erythrocyte life span is compromised severely, which threatens the organism with anemia and iron toxicity2,3. Here we identify an on-demand mechanism that clears erythrocytes and recycles iron. We show that monocytes that express high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (LY6C1, also known as Ly-6C) ingest stressed and senescent erythrocytes, accumulate in the liver via coordinated chemotactic cues, and differentiate into ferroportin 1 (FPN1, encoded by SLC40A1)-expressing macrophages that can deliver iron to hepatocytes. Monocyte-derived FPN1+Tim-4neg macrophages are transient, reside alongside embryonically derived T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (Timd4, also known as Tim-4)high Kupffer cells (KCs), and depend on the growth factor Csf1 and the transcription factor Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l2). The spleen, likewise, recruits iron-loaded Ly-6Chigh monocytes, but these do not differentiate into iron-recycling macrophages, owing to the suppressive action of Csf2. The accumulation of a transient macrophage population in the liver also occurs in mouse models of hemolytic anemia, anemia of inflammation, and sickle cell disease. Inhibition of monocyte recruitment to the liver during stressed erythrocyte delivery leads to kidney and liver damage. These observations identify the liver as the primary organ that supports rapid erythrocyte removal and iron recycling, and uncover a mechanism by which the body adapts to fluctuations in erythrocyte integrity."

The tradition of consanguinity, variably practiced in the Persian Gulf region, North Africa, and Central Asia, has resulted in an elevated burden of recessive disease. Here we generated a whole-exome GME variome from 1,111 unrelated subjects. We detected substantial diversity and admixture in continental and subregional populations, corresponding to several ancient founder populations with little evidence of bottlenecks. Measured consanguinity rates were an order of magnitude above those in other sampled populations, and the GME population exhibited an increased burden of runs of homozygosity (ROHs) but showed no evidence for reduced burden of deleterious variation due to classically theorized 'genetic purging'. Applying this database to unsolved recessive conditions in the GME population reduced the number of potential disease-causing variants by four- to sevenfold. These results show variegated genetic architecture in GME populations and support future human genetic discoveries in Mendelian and population genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2500258178,"Robbie Waugh, Nils Stein, Gary Muehlbauer and colleagues report the exome sequencing of 267 landraces and wild accessions of barley from diverse regions to study adaptations to different agricultural environments. They observe correlations of days to heading and height with environment and find that variation in flowering-associated genes has strong geographical structuring. After domestication, during a process of widespread range extension, barley adapted to a broad spectrum of agricultural environments. To explore how the barley genome responded to the environmental challenges it encountered, we sequenced the exomes of a collection of 267 georeferenced landraces and wild accessions. A combination of genome-wide analyses showed that patterns of variation have been strongly shaped by geography and that variant-by-environment associations for individual genes are prominent in our data set. We observed significant correlations of days to heading (flowering) and height with seasonal temperature and dryness variables in common garden experiments, suggesting that these traits were major drivers of environmental adaptation in the sampled germplasm. A detailed analysis of known flowering-associated genes showed that many contain extensive sequence variation and that patterns of single- and multiple-gene haplotypes exhibit strong geographical structuring. This variation appears to have substantially contributed to range-wide ecogeographical adaptation, but many factors key to regional success remain unidentified."
https://openalex.org/W2498404744,"Mutations in the epigenetic modifiers DNMT3A and TET2 non-randomly co-occur in lymphoma and leukemia despite their epistasis in the methylation-hydroxymethylation pathway. Using Dnmt3a and Tet2 double-knockout mice in which the development of malignancy is accelerated, we show that the double-knockout methylome reflects regions of independent, competitive and cooperative activity. Expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, including the erythroid regulators Klf1 and Epor, is upregulated in double-knockout hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). DNMT3A and TET2 both repress Klf1, suggesting a model of cooperative inhibition by epigenetic modifiers. These data demonstrate a dual role for TET2 in promoting and inhibiting HSC differentiation, the loss of which, along with DNMT3A, obstructs differentiation, leading to transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2498192911,"The notion of species as reproductively isolated units related through a bifurcating tree implies that gene trees should generally agree with the species tree and that sister taxa should not share polymorphisms unless they diverged recently and should be equally closely related to outgroups. It is now possible to evaluate this model systematically. We sequenced multiple individuals from 27 described taxa representing the entire Arabidopsis genus. Cluster analysis identified seven groups, corresponding to described species that capture the structure of the genus. However, at the level of gene trees, only the separation of Arabidopsis thaliana from the remaining species was universally supported, and, overall, the amount of shared polymorphism demonstrated that reproductive isolation was considerably more recent than the estimated divergence times. We uncovered multiple cases of past gene flow that contradict a bifurcating species tree. Finally, we showed that the pattern of divergence differs between gene ontologies, suggesting a role for selection."
https://openalex.org/W2475605691,"Nils Stein, Ehud Weiss, Tzion Fahima, Johannes Krause and colleagues report the genome sequences of 6,000-year-old barley grains obtained from desert caves in Israel. They compare these to whole-exome sequences of a modern barley diversity panel to explore domestication and migration patterns, finding evidence for prehistoric gene flow between wild and cultivated populations. The cereal grass barley was domesticated about 10,000 years before the present in the Fertile Crescent and became a founder crop of Neolithic agriculture1. Here we report the genome sequences of five 6,000-year-old barley grains excavated at a cave in the Judean Desert close to the Dead Sea. Comparison to whole-exome sequence data from a diversity panel of present-day barley accessions showed the close affinity of ancient samples to extant landraces from the Southern Levant and Egypt, consistent with a proposed origin of domesticated barley in the Upper Jordan Valley. Our findings suggest that barley landraces grown in present-day Israel have not experienced major lineage turnover over the past six millennia, although there is evidence for gene flow between cultivated and sympatric wild populations. We demonstrate the usefulness of ancient genomes from desiccated archaeobotanical remains in informing research into the origin, early domestication and subsequent migration of crop species."
https://openalex.org/W2476937757,"Previous studies mainly focused on the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in tumor cells, whereas the effects of the EGFR on immune responses has not been determined. Our study shows that the EGFR signaling pathway play a role in the regulation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in cancer patients. The EGF-like growth factor Amphiregulin (AREG) protein was frequently up-regulated in a tissue microarray, which was associated with worse overall survival. Additionally, in sera, tissue specimens, and effusions of lung or gastric cancer patients, up-regulated AREG protein enhanced the suppressive function of Treg cells. AREG maintained the Treg cell suppressive function via the EGFR/GSK-3β/Foxp3 axis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib restored the activity of GSK-3β and attenuated Treg cell function. β-TrCP was involved in GSK-3β-mediated Foxp3 degradation, and mass spectrometry identified Lys356 as the ubiquitination site of Foxp3 by β-TrCP. These findings demonstrate the posttranslational regulation of Foxp3 expression by AREG in cancer patients through AREG/EGFR/GSK-3β signaling, which could lead to Foxp3 protein degradation in Treg cells and a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2479861806,"Modeling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) aims to reenact embryogenesis, maturation and aging of spinal motor neurons (spMNs) in vitro. As the maturity of spMNs grown in vitro compared to spMNs in vivo remains largely unaddressed, it is unclear to what extent this in vitro system captures critical aspects of spMN development and molecular signatures associated with ALS. Here, we compared transcriptomes among iPSC-derived spMNs, fetal spinal tissues and adult spinal tissues. This approach produced a maturation scale revealing that iPSC-derived spMNs were more similar to fetal spinal tissue than to adult spMNs. Additionally, we resolved gene networks and pathways associated with spMN maturation and aging. These networks enriched for pathogenic familial ALS genetic variants and were disrupted in sporadic ALS spMNs. Altogether, our findings suggest that developing strategies to further mature and age iPSC-derived spMNs will provide more effective iPSC models of ALS pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2491676496,"Mutations in MECP2 cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT). The RTT missense MECP2R306C mutation prevents MeCP2 from interacting with the NCoR/histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) complex; however, the neuronal function of HDAC3 is incompletely understood. We found that neuronal deletion of Hdac3 in mice elicited abnormal locomotor coordination, sociability and cognition. Transcriptional and chromatin profiling revealed that HDAC3 positively regulated a subset of genes and was recruited to active gene promoters via MeCP2. HDAC3-associated promoters were enriched for the FOXO transcription factors, and FOXO acetylation was elevated in Hdac3 knockout (KO) and Mecp2 KO neurons. Human RTT-patient-derived MECP2R306C neural progenitor cells had deficits in HDAC3 and FOXO recruitment and gene expression. Gene editing of MECP2R306C cells to generate isogenic controls rescued HDAC3-FOXO-mediated impairments in gene expression. Our data suggest that HDAC3 interaction with MeCP2 positively regulates a subset of neuronal genes through FOXO deacetylation, and disruption of HDAC3 contributes to cognitive and social impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2506705299,"Fungal infections claim an estimated 1.5 million lives each year. Mechanisms that protect from fungal infections are still elusive. Recognition of fungal pathogens relies on C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and their downstream signaling kinase SYK. Here we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB controls proximal CLR signaling in macrophages and dendritic cells. We show that CBLB associates with SYK and ubiquitinates SYK, dectin-1, and dectin-2 after fungal recognition. Functionally, CBLB deficiency results in increased inflammasome activation, enhanced reactive oxygen species production, and increased fungal killing. Genetic deletion of Cblb protects mice from morbidity caused by cutaneous infection and markedly improves survival after a lethal systemic infection with Candida albicans. On the basis of these findings, we engineered a cell-permeable CBLB inhibitory peptide that protects mice from lethal C. albicans infections. We thus describe a key role for Cblb in the regulation of innate antifungal immunity and establish a novel paradigm for the treatment of fungal sepsis."

Development of a malaria vaccine that effectively protects against parasite infection of both the natural host, Anopheles mosquitoes, and its secondary host, man, would effectively disrupt transmission and clinical disease. The most well known investigational vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria that recently received a positive scientific opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in July 2015, is identified as RTS,S (MosquirixTM). This vaccine targets the circumsporozoite protein that is present on the surface of the sporozoite, the parasite stage that infects man (1Agnandji S.T. Lell B. Soulanoudjingar S.S. Fernandes J.F.

A phase 1 study demonstrated that human antibodies raised against a recombinant Pfs25 (Pfs25H) protein formulated in Montanide ISA 51, a water-in-oil adjuvant formulation, were biologically active in an ex vivo feeding assay (3Wu Y.

More recently, in preclinical studies, Pfs25H has been shown to have enhanced immunogenic properties when chemically conjugated to a carrier molecule such as Neisseria meningitis outer membrane protein complex (4Wu Y.

A primary bottleneck in recombinant protein production has been the presence of an unique disulfide bond structure initially modeled by Gerloff et al. (24Gerloff D.L. Creasey A. Maslau S. Carter R.

More recent characterization of a poorly expressed, E. coli recombinant P. falciparum asexual parasite protein Pf12 by NMR led to the confirmation that the 6-cysteine protein-folds within Pf12 are similar to a Toxoplasma protein identified as SAG1 (25Arredondo S.A.

Given the difficulty to produce recombinant proteins with a 6-cysteine motif in a manner suitable for full biochemical and biophysical characterization, we aimed to develop a process and recombinant protein product of suitable quality, quantity, and purity for human clinical testing. Two scalable and commercial production platforms were assessed. Here we report on the identification, production, and characterization of an E. coli expressed and refolded Pfs230 protein (Pfs230D1–2) and a Pichia pastoris-expressed Pfs230 protein (Pfs230D1H) comprised of domains 1–2 or domain 1, respectively. Both forms of purified recombinant Pfs230 induced transmission blocking antibodies in rabbits, however, based on comparative studies the P. pastoris Pfs230D1H protein was more effective at inducing transmission blocking antibodies.

Parasitol. 1995; 75: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) identified a natural cleavage site upstream of Pfs230 domain 1, which was used as the basis for the N-terminal boundary. The boundary for the C terminus varied depending on the expression system. In P. pastoris, the recombinant protein boundaries included the non-structured domain through domain 1 (Pfs230D1H) and in E. coli the boundaries included the non-structured domain through domain 2 (Pfs230D1–2) (see schematic Fig. 1A). Both recombinant Pfs230D1H and Pfs230D1–2 proteins contained a His6 C-terminal fusion tag to facilitate purification. A third recombinant form of Pfs230, Pfs230D1M, was homologous to the Pfs230D1H protein except for the removal of the His6 fusion tag. The E. coli expressed Pfs230D1–2 protein was refolded and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant Pfs230D1–2 had the expected N termini (MEYVDEK) with the non-native M retained as determined by Edman degradation. Recombinant Pfs230D1–2 demonstrated the presence of disulfide bond formation as observed by a mobility shift by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE under non-reduced versus reduced conditions (Fig. 1B). Additional analyses by analytical size exclusion chromatography with online multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS-HPLC) and reversed-phase (RP) HPLC demonstrated that the protein was principally monomeric in solution (85%) with an observed molar mass of 64.5 kDa and by RP-HPLC was resolved as a single asymmetric peak (Fig. 1, G and H, respectively). Even though the initial P. pastoris expression plasmid was designed to secrete a recombinant protein that contained the non-structured domain through domain 1 (amino acids Tyr444-Gly736), the Pfs230D1H shown in Fig. 1B by Coomassie Blue staining was consistently cleaved at Ser542 based on N-terminal sequencing and intact electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (observed mass: 21,847.5 Da was consistent with an expected mass with cleavage at Ser542). This constituted a loss of a 98-amino acid N-terminal fragment. Based on these empirical results, a second production clone was developed such that the designed synthetic gene and translated protein were consistent with the N terminus observed for the Pfs230D1H. The new purified recombinant protein, identified as Pfs230D1M, had the expected N terminus (SVLQSGAL) and a native C terminus due to the removal of the His6 fusion tag. The expected intact mass (21,849.8 Da) was consistent with the observed intact mass (21,847.5 Da) (Fig. 1C). An expected shift in the intact mass of approximately 4 daltons was observed upon reduction of Pfs230D1M consistent with the presence of two disulfide bonds. The far-UV CD spectrum demonstrated that Pfs230D1H and Pfs230D1M had similar secondary structures (Fig. 1D). The secondary structure of Pfs230D1M using DICHROWEB was determined to be α-helix: 8 ± 2%, β-sheet: 33 ± 5%, β-turn: 19 ± 7%, and unordered: 40 ± 5%. SEC-MALS-HPLC showed that Pfs230D1M and Pfs230D1H were monomeric in solution with molar masses of 21.9 and 23.1 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1E and data not shown, respectively). An analysis of their integrity by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) showed a single symmetrical peak for each recombinant protein (Fig. 1F and data not shown, respectively). Finally, we evaluated the thermal stability of Pfs230D1M following a temperature ramp and a change in the secondary structure using far-UV CD spectroscopy. A major change in the ellipticity was observed between 55 and 60 °C and after complete denaturation at 80 °C and cooling to 20 °C, the secondary structure appeared similar to the original material (Fig. 2) indicating the thermal stability is suitable for a vaccine component. To accurately assess the immunogenicity of these recombinant proteins, the endotoxin and host cell protein content were also determined. The endotoxin levels were all below 5 endotoxin units/mg of protein and the concentration of host cell proteins, in particular for the P. pastoris expressed proteins using a process specific immunoblot assay were less than 0.5% (w/w) (26Zhu D. Saul A.J. Miles A.P. A quantitative slot blot assay for host cell protein impurities in recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli.J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 306: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To assess the recombinant proteins' conformation, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced against P. falciparum-enriched gametes and then screened for reactivity against native and recombinant forms of Pfs230. One mAb, identified as 4F12, recognized both native and recombinant forms of Pfs230 by Western blotting (Fig. 1I, left and right panels, respectively). The reactivity was observed primarily under non-reduced conditions indicating mAb 4F12 recognized a conformational epitope. Affinity purification of native gamete lysates with mAb 4F12 followed by in-gel tryptic digestion and mass spectroscopy identified tryptic peptide fragments enriched for Pfs230 (data not shown). mAb 4F12 also recognized Pfs230 on the surface of unfixed gametes by live IFA (Fig. 3A). A Pfs25-specific mAb 4B7 was included in the live IFA study as a positive control for the assay (Fig. 3A). Secondary antibody reagents were negative for parasite staining (data not shown). mAb 4F12, isotype IgG1, inhibited mosquito infectivity in the ex vivo SMFA by 99.6 to 100% at 1.0 mg/ml along with a corresponding reduction in parasite prevalence (as defined as the percentage of uninfected mosquitoes compared with the total number of mosquitoes fed) with or without human complement (Table 1). The Pfs25-specific mAb 4B7, which blocked mosquito transmission by greater than 85% at ∼0.5 mg/ml (Table 1), was included as a positive control (27Cheru L. Wu Y. Diouf A. Moretz S.E. Muratova O.V.

Open table in a new tab Paired rabbits were immunized with the three recombinant forms of Pfs230 formulated in a water-in-oil adjuvant at different stages during development. The rabbit antisera generated against each of the three Pfs230 proteins recognized native Pfs230 on the surface of live gametes by IFA using a modified-live IFA approach (Fig. 3 or data not shown) or a standard approach as shown for rabbit Pfs230D1M-specific antisera (Fig. 3C). During the modified live IFA, the rabbit Pfs230D1M-specific antiserum was co-incubated with the Pfs25-specific mAb 4B7 (Fig. 3B). In this analysis, Pfs230 was shown to be co-expressed with Pfs25 on the surface of a live sexual stage parasite, likely a young zygote. These antisera were evaluated for transmission blocking activity using the ex vivo SMFA. The SMFA results along with the antibody titers as determined by ELISA and represented as a reciprocal dilution at an OD1 are summarized in Table 2. Antisera from all three sets of paired rabbits generated transmission blocking activity (TBA). Most importantly, a head to head comparison to assess the TBA of Pfs230D1–2 and Pfs230D1H rabbit serum at a 1:16 dilution showed that Pfs230D1H induced an enhanced level of blocking activity (0–4.7 versus 99–100%, p < 0.001) (Table 2). This surprising result was confirmed by additional studies in which antibodies against Pfs230D1–2 consistently required a higher concentration of antisera or IgG to achieve similar levels of TBA (data not shown). Subsequently, the functional activity and ELISA titers induced by Pfs230D1M were shown to be similar for Pfs230D1H (Table 2). As anticipated (20Healer J. McGuinness D. Hopcroft P. Haley S. Carter R. Riley E. Complement-mediated lysis of Plasmodium falciparum gametes by malaria-immune human sera is associated with antibodies to the gamete surface antigen Pfs230.Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3017-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human complement was important for optimum blocking using sera or purified rabbit IgG because SMFA studies performed in the absence of human complement showed a decreased blocking activity (data not shown). Given the significant enhancement in TBA generated by the recombinant Pfs230D1H/M proteins, the recombinant Pfs230D1M protein was selected for further development.TABLE 2Standard membrane feeding assay results for rabbit antisera generated against Pfs230D1–2, Pfs230D1H, and Pfs230D1M with human complementELISA titer OD1aELISA titer reported as reciprocal dilution at an OD1.AntigenRabbit No.Serum dilutionD1–2D1HD1MInfected/disssectedAverage No. oocystsMedian No. oocysts (range)Reduction oocystsReduction prevalence%D1–21.11:4.581K37KNDbND, not done.7/200.850 (0–5)96.9c% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 25.2, median 24, range minimum 0 and maximum 68).651.2117K25KND13/202.301 (1–11)91.5c% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 25.2, median 24, range minimum 0 and maximum 68).351.11:1620/2067.869 (25–113)0d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).01.218/2057.554 (0–113)4.7d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).10D1H2.31:4.524K85KND0/2000 (0–0)100d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).1002.447K158KND0/2000 (0–0)100d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).1002.31:161/200.050 (0–1)99.9d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).952.40/2000 (0–0)100d% Reduction of oocysts are derived from the denominator as average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 61.4, median 58.5, range minimum 0 and maximum 114).100D1M11:4.5NDND131K0/2000 (0–0)100e% Reduction of oocysts and prevalence are derived from a denominator as the average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 19.2, median 19, range minimum 9 and maximum 36).1002NDND220K0/2000 (0–0)100e% Reduction of oocysts and prevalence are derived from a denominator as the average number of oocysts in adjuvant control (average 19.2, median 19, range minimum 9 and maximum 36).10011:90/2000 (0–0)100f% reduction of oocysts and prevalence a"

https://openalex.org/W2483585301,"Jian Zhang and colleagues identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB as a major inhibitor of host defense against Candida albicans infection and show that targeting CBLB can protect mice from lethal candidiasis. Disseminated candidiasis has become one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired blood stream infections with high mobility and mortality. However, the molecular basis of host defense against disseminated candidiasis remains elusive, and treatment options are limited. Here we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLB directs polyubiquitination of dectin-1 and dectin-2, two key pattern-recognition receptors for sensing Candida albicans, and their downstream kinase SYK, thus inhibiting dectin-1- and dectin-2-mediated innate immune responses. CBLB deficiency or inactivation protects mice from systemic infection with a lethal dose of C. albicans, and deficiency of dectin-1, dectin-2, or both in Cblb−/− mice abrogates this protection. Notably, silencing the Cblb gene in vivo protects mice from lethal systemic C. albicans infection. Our data reveal that CBLB is crucial for homeostatic control of innate immune responses mediated by dectin-1 and dectin-2. Our data also indicate that CBLB represents a potential therapeutic target for protection from disseminated candidiasis."

The redox cofactor NAD was recently discovered to be attached to small regulatory RNAs in bacteria in a cap-like manner, and Nudix hydrolase NudC was found to act as a NAD-decapping enzyme in vitro and in vivo. Here, crystal structures of Escherichia coli NudC in complex with substrate NAD and with cleavage product NMN reveal the catalytic residues lining the binding pocket and principles underlying molecular recognition of substrate and product. Biochemical mutation analysis identifies the conserved Nudix motif as the catalytic center of the enzyme, which needs to be homodimeric, as the catalytic pocket is composed of amino acids from both monomers. NudC is single-strand specific and has a purine preference for the 5'-terminal nucleotide. The enzyme strongly prefers NAD-linked RNA (NAD-RNA) over NAD and binds to a diverse set of cellular RNAs in an unspecific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2490145550,"Death domain superfamily members typically act as adaptors mediating in the assembly of supramolecular complexes with critical apoptosis and inflammation functions. These modular proteins consist of death domains, death effector domains, caspase recruitment domains, and pyrin domains (PYD). Despite the high structural similarity among them, only homotypic interactions participate in complex formation, suggesting that subtle factors differentiate each interaction type. It is thus critical to identify these factors as an essential step toward the understanding of the molecular basis of apoptosis and inflammation. The proteins apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and NLRP3 play key roles in the regulation of apoptosis and inflammation through self-association and protein-protein interactions mediated by their PYDs. To better understand the molecular basis of their function, we have characterized ASC and NLRP3 PYD self-association and their intermolecular interaction by solution NMR spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation. We found that ASC self-associates and binds NLRP3 PYD through equivalent protein regions, with higher binding affinity for the latter. These regions are located at opposite sides of the protein allowing multimeric complex formation previously shown in ASC PYD fibril assemblies. We show that NLRP3 PYD coexists in solution as a monomer and highly populated large-order oligomerized species. Despite this, we determined its monomeric three-dimensional solution structure by NMR and characterized its binding to ASC PYD. Using our novel structural data, we propose molecular models of ASC·ASC and ASC·NLRP3 PYD early supramolecular complexes, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of inflammasome and apoptosis signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2488640608,"Depression is a significant public health problem for which currently available medications, if effective, require weeks to months of treatment before patients respond. Previous studies have shown that the G protein responsible for increasing cAMP (Gαs) is increasingly localized to lipid rafts in depressed subjects and that chronic antidepressant treatment translocates Gαs from lipid rafts. Translocation of Gαs, which shows delayed onset after chronic antidepressant treatment of rats or of C6 glioma cells, tracks with the delayed onset of therapeutic action of antidepressants. Because antidepressants appear to specifically modify Gαs localized to lipid rafts, we sought to determine whether structurally diverse antidepressants accumulate in lipid rafts. Sustained treatment of C6 glioma cells, which lack 5-hydroxytryptamine transporters, showed marked concentration of several antidepressants in raft fractions, as revealed by increased absorbance and by mass fingerprint. Closely related molecules without antidepressant activity did not concentrate in raft fractions. Thus, at least two classes of antidepressants accumulate in lipid rafts and effect translocation of Gαs to the non-raft membrane fraction, where it activates the cAMP-signaling cascade. Analysis of the structural determinants of raft localization may both help to explain the hysteresis of antidepressant action and lead to design and development of novel substrates for depression therapeutics.

Analysis of the structural determinants of raft localization may both help to explain the hysteresis of antidepressant action and lead to design and development of novel substrates for depression therapeutics. Depression is the leading cause of long term disability in the industrialized world (1Chen G. Twyman R. Manji H.K. p11 and gene therapy for severe psychiatric disorders: a practical goal?.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 54ps51Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although depression is a significant health problem in the United States and antidepressants are heavily prescribed (2Olfson M. Marcus S.C. National patterns in antidepressant medication treatment.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 848-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), the mechanism of action for these drugs is not understood. Further, nearly a third of those treated with these drugs do not achieve remission of their depression (3Rush A.J. Trivedi M.H. Wisniewski S.R. Nierenberg A.A. Stewart J.W. Warden D. Niederehe G. Thase M.E. Lavori P.W. Lebowitz B.D. McGrath P.J. Rosenbaum J.F. Sackeim H.A. Kupfer D.J. Luther J. Fava M. Acute and longer-term outcomes in depressed outpatients requiring one or several treatment steps: a STAR*D report.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2006; 163: 1905-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). Although most of these drugs do interfere with monoamine uptake or catabolism, they exert this effect within hours, even though most of the compounds require weeks before alleviation of symptoms is observed (4Maes M. Yirmyia R. Noraberg J. Brene S. Hibbeln J. Perini G. Kubera M. Bob P. Lerer B. Maj M. The inflammatory & neurodegenerative (I&ND) hypothesis of depression: leads for future research and new drug developments in depression.Metab. Brain Dis. 2009; 24: 27-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Thus, other targets for antidepressant drugs may exist (4Maes M. Yirmyia R. Noraberg J. Brene S. Hibbeln J. Perini G. Kubera M.

Brain Dis. 2009; 24: 27-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Chronic antidepressant treatment engages signaling pathways apart from increasing monoamine density in the synaptic cleft. One of these is an increased accumulation of cellular cAMP and sequelae thereof, such as increased cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and increased transcription of cAMP-regulated genes (e.g. BDNF) (5Duman R.S. Heninger G.R. Nestler E.J. A molecular and cellular theory of depression.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1997; 54: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). Moreover, positron emission tomography (PET) evidence suggests that cAMP is diminished throughout the brain of depressed human subjects (6Fujita M. Hines C.S. Zoghbi S.S. Mallinger A.G.

Thus, it is possible that some antidepressant effects are mediated through induction of the cAMP-generating system, including Gαs and adenylyl cyclase. Previous studies demonstrated that chronic antidepressant treatment translocates Gαs from lipid rafts, whereupon it engages in a more facile activation of adenylyl cyclase (7Toki S. Donati R.J.

Lipid rafts are regions of the plasma membrane rich in caveolin, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and cytoskeletal and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (9Brown D.A. London E.

Dampened signaling, through Gαs and/or Gαs-coupled receptors, is consistent with the observed increase in Gαs association with rafts as well as lowered levels of cAMP seen in major depressive disorder (15Donati R.J.

Accordingly, Gαs content in non-raft membrane domains increases after chronic treatment with fluoxetine, desipramine, and escitalopram (16Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Chronic antidepressant treatment prevents accumulation of Gsα in cholesterol-rich, cytoskeletal-associated, plasma membrane domains (lipid rafts).Neuropsychopharmacology. 2005; 30: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cAMP is increased (17Ozawa H.

Sustained activation of Gαs is also associated with increased microtubule dynamics and a resulting increase in neurite outgrowth (18Yu J.Z. Dave R.H. Allen J.A. Sarma T. Rasenick M.M.

Furthermore, lipid raft disruption displaces many raft proteins, but chronic antidepressant treatment displaces only Gαs (7Toki S. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Treatment of C6 glioma cells and rats with antidepressant drugs increases the detergent extraction of Gsα from plasma membrane.J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the precise biochemical mechanisms that account for the antidepressant-mediated translocation of Gαs from lipid rafts was not well defined and presented a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the complex pharmacology of antidepressants. We hypothesized that antidepressants accumulate gradually in lipid rafts and modulate the distribution of Gαs in the membrane. Results in this study are consistent with that hypothesis and reveal novel binding domains for antidepressants that may be consistent with delayed therapeutic response. Although there are many potential targets for monoamine-centric drugs, none offer an explanation for the hysteresis (6–8 weeks) between initiation of therapy and clinical efficacy. C6 glioma cells were used in these experiments because they do not express monoamine transport proteins (Fig. 1), yet sustained treatment with antidepressant drugs translocates Gαs from lipid rafts to non-raft regions of the plasma membrane (7Toki S.

Furthermore, glia may contribute to both the etiology and the treatment of depression (21Sanacora G. Treccani G. Popoli M.

One binding site for many of the antidepressant drugs (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs) is the serotonin reuptake transport protein (SERT). To determine whether SERT expression affects the redistribution of Gαs, C6 cells stably expressing Gαs-GFP were engineered to also express SERT. Gαs-GFP is identical in its activation by GPCR and activation of adenylyl cyclase with wild type Gαs (23Yu J.Z. Rasenick M.M. Real-time visualization of a fluorescent Gαs: dissociation of the activated G protein from plasma membrane.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When kept to a moderate level of expression (2–3× endogenous Gαs), Gαs-GFP is transparent to cellular physiology, allowing a window on its movements in response to treatment with antidepressants (Gαs moves out of lipid rafts) (24Allen J.A. Yu J.Z. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. β-Adrenergic receptor stimulation promotes Gαs internalization through lipid rafts: a study in living cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1493-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Gαs-GFP translocation from lipid rafts in response to escitalopram, as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), does not improve upon expression of hSERT (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). Moreover, HEK cells do not respond to chronic stimulation with escitalopram, nor when stably transfected with hSERT (Fig. 1, D and E, respectively). These data suggest that some additional cellular component is responsible for the redistribution of Gαs, and we hypothesized that the antidepressant drugs accumulate, gradually, in lipid rafts. Due to our earlier observations that Gαs translocates from rafts after extended exposure to antidepressants (8Zhang L. Rasenick M.M. Chronic treatment with escitalopram but not R-citalopram translocates Gαs from lipid raft domains and potentiates adenylyl cyclase: a 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter-independent action of this antidepressant compound.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 332: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the observations by Rupprecht and colleagues (25Eisensamer B. Uhr M. Meyr S. Gimpl G. Deiml T. Rammes G. Lambert J.J. Zieglgänsberger W. Holsboer F. Rupprecht R. Antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs colocalize with 5-HT3 receptors in raft-like domains.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10198-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that antidepressants preferentially associate with lipid rafts, and that all monoamine-centric antidepressants share this property. We assessed the accumulation of representative drugs from each antidepressant class: MAO inhibitor (phenelzine), tricyclic antidepressant (desipramine, imipramine, and amitriptyline), and SSRI (escitalopram/inactive stereoisomer R-citalopram and fluoxetine), as well as the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole, which has some independent antidepressant properties, and the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, which does not (26Nelson J.C. Papakostas G.I. Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2009; 166: 980-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We expected that antidepressants would gradually accumulate in raft fractions of C6 cells over time to mediate the translocation of Gαs out of the lipid raft and that the non-antidepressant compounds tested would not have this property. Lipid raft fractions were isolated via sucrose density gradient, and the UV-visible spectrum was taken for each fraction. Each antidepressant absorbs at a characteristic wavelength for which measurements were normalized to protein content in the sample and the -fold change was calculated relative to treatment-naive or untreated controls. The accumulation of drugs over time in lipid raft fractions of the plasma membrane appears to be a class-specific mechanism (e.g. SSRIs and MAO inhibitors) (Fig. 2A). Olanzapine, an antipsychotic lacking primary antidepressant properties (27Rothschild A.J. Bates K.S. Boehringer K.L. Syed A. Olanzapine response in psychotic depression.J. Clin. Psychiatry. 1999; 60: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), appears to accumulate as well, which may be due to its highly hydrophobic nature (Fig. 2B). However, analysis of raft fractions by GC-MS revealed that accumulation of drugs in rafts is independent of hydrophobicity, as olanzapine and aripiprazole do not accumulate. Escitalopram, and its therapeutically inactive enantiomer, R-citalopram, were selected for further investigation. To parallel the experiments by Eisensamer et al. (25Eisensamer B. Uhr M. Meyr S. Gimpl G. Deiml T. Rammes G. Lambert J.J. Zieglgänsberger W. Holsboer F. Rupprecht R. Antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs colocalize with 5-HT3 receptors in raft-like domains.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10198-10206Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), escitalopram was added to sucrose density gradients prepared from membrane fractions. Escitalopram, but not R-citalopram, associated with lipid raft fractions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). To minimize background measurements as much as possible for this method of detection, we normalized the readings to protein (280 nm) and subtracted the control absorbance. These measurements were then corroborated via mass spectrometry. GC-MS is sensitive and selective, due in large part to the separation efficiency achieved in the analysis of small molecules. C6 cells were treated for 72 h with 10 μm of antidepressant, and the lipid raft fraction was extracted for determination of drug presence. Analysis of the total ion chromatograms (TICs) of lipid raft extractions showed that only phenelzine, fluoxetine, and escitalopram accumulated in lipid rafts after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 3); R-citalopram, imipramine, amitriptyline, aripiprazole, and olanzapine did not accumulate, although with the exception of R-citalopram, each of these drugs shows an “antidepressant signature” in translocating Gαs from lipid rafts. Base peaks of the molecular ion profile from each TIC elution profile were matched to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database to identify the drug presence among membrane fractions. The accumulation of escitalopram, fluoxetine, and phenelzine, but not R-citalopram or olanzapine, parallels their capacity to mediate the movement of Gαs from lipid rafts (20Czysz A.H. Schappi J.M. Rasenick M.M. Lateral diffusion of Gαs in the plasma membrane is decreased after chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment: role of lipid raft and non-raft membrane microdomains.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because neither the tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine, imipramine, and amitriptyline) nor aripiprazole accumulate in rafts, this phenomenon may be class-specific for antidepressants. Furthermore, accumulation is independent of the lipophilicity of the compound (Fig. 2B). The finding that antidepressants, but not other related drugs, demonstrated gradual accumulation, along with the stereospecificity of antidepressant accumulation, led us to select escitalopram for closer analysis. Tracking the accumulation of escitalopram in the lipid raft fraction derived from C6 cells with GC-MS analysis revealed that escitalopram accumulates in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Detectable accumulation occurred following 1 μm treatments for 72 h or 100 nm treatments for 120 h and at 24-, 48-, and 72-h treatments with 10 μm escitalopram (Fig. 4). Treatment with 10 μm antidepressant for 72 h is a standard assay condition (8Zhang L. Rasenick M.M. Chronic treatment with escitalopram but not R-citalopram translocates Gαs from lipid raft domains and potentiates adenylyl cyclase: a 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter-independent action of this antidepressant compound.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 332: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and parallels doses used in rat studies (7Toki S. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Treatment of C6 glioma cells and rats with antidepressant drugs increases the detergent extraction of Gsα from plasma membrane.J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Vetulani J. Sulser F. Action of various antidepressant treatments reduces reactivity of noradrenergic cyclic AMP-generating system in limbic forebrain.Nature. 1975; 257: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, these drugs translocate Gαs at concentrations as low as 50 nm over the same period (29Chen J. Rasenick M.M. Chronic treatment of C6 glioma cells with antidepressant drugs increases functional coupling between a G protein (Gs) and adenylyl cyclase.J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These measurements are consistent with the drug time and dose required for Gαs translocation from rafts, measured either directly (8Zhang L. Rasenick M.M. Chronic treatment with escitalopram but not R-citalopram translocates Gαs from lipid raft domains and potentiates adenylyl cyclase: a 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter-independent action of this antidepressant compound.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 332: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or by FRAP (20Czysz A.H. Schappi J.M. Rasenick M.M. Lateral diffusion of Gαs in the plasma membrane is decreased after chronic but not acute antidepressant treatment: role of lipid raft and non-raft membrane microdomains.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, stereo specificity and the fact that escitalopram does not accumulate over time in HEK cells indicates a specific target (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, antidepressant-mediated redistribution of Gαs independent of SERT suggests a molecular drug-binding target that is distinct from the monoamine transport system. Only a protein target(s) could account for both the enantioselectivity as well as the lack of hydrophobic contribution toward the gradual accumulation of SSRIs in lipid rafts. Gαs is a membrane-associated protein that inhabits cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains (15Donati R.J. Dwivedi Y. Roberts R.C. Conley R.R. Pandey G.N. Rasenick M.M. Postmortem brain tissue of depressed suicides reveals increased Gsα localization in lipid raft domains where it is less likely to activate adenylyl cyclase.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3042-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Data presented above suggest that sustained treatment of cells with several antidepressants results in the accumulation of those compounds in lipid rafts and correlates with the membrane redistribution of Gαs. Because the antidepressant drugs used in this study were not strongly hydrophobic, and escitalopram, but not R-citalopram (equal lipophilicity), accumulates in lipid rafts, it is likely that an unidentified lipid raft protein is the binding site for antidepressants. Lipid rafts contain many of the anchoring cytoskeleton-associated membrane structures and facilitate molecular association(s) of a vast array of different membrane-embedded and -associated proteins to initiate intracellular signaling. Although lipid rafts can facilitate this clustering of signaling molecules, the rigid structure afforded by increased cholesterol content appears to have a globally dampening effect on Gαs signaling by inhibiting association(s) between raft- and non-raft-based molecules (13Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Lipid raft microdomains and neurotransmitter signalling.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Dampened signaling, through Gαs and/or Gαs-coupled receptors, is consistent with the observed increase in Gαs association with rafts as well as the increased lipid raft localization of Gαs seen in postmortem major depressive disorder brain (15Donati R.J. Dwivedi Y. Roberts R.C. Conley R.R. Pandey G.N. Rasenick M.M.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3042-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs results in Gαs translocation from lipid rafts to non-raft regions of the plasma membrane, and the extent of translocation is dependent upon both drug dose and treatment duration. This has been observed in both rats (7Toki S. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Treatment of C6 glioma cells and rats with antidepressant drugs increases the detergent extraction of Gsα from plasma membrane.J.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1426-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, lipid raft disruption through cholesterol depletion or cytoskeletal disruption displaces many raft proteins, but GPCR activation or antidepressant treatment displaces only Gαs (7Toki S. Donati R.J. Rasenick M.M. Treatment of C6 glioma cells and rats with antidepressant drugs increases the detergent extraction of Gsα from plasma membrane.J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1114-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Binding to the reuptake transport machinery and inhibition of neurotransmitter reuptake are rapid, but require several weeks of treatment to achieve clinical efficacy, and this is duplicated (albeit in a more rapid timescale) in C6 glioma cells. Estimates of the ratio of glia to neurons vary considerably, but evidence suggests that glia control the number and stability of neuronal synapses formed (31Ullian E.M. Christopherson K.S. Barres B.A. Role for glia in synaptogenesis.Glia. 2004; 47: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 32Yan K. Popova J.S. Moss A. Shah B. Rasenick M.M.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chronic antidepressant treatment has been shown to increase the expression and release of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (33Hisaoka K. Maeda N. Tsuchioka M. Takebayashi M.

Our results demonstrated that HFe rats had increased plasma non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI), malondialdehyde (MDA), cardiac iron and MDA levels and cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to LV dysfunction. Although DFO, DFP, DFX or NAC improved these parameters, leading to improved LV function, the combined DFP and NAC therapy caused greater improvement, leading to more extensively improved LV function.The combined DFP and NAC treatment had greater efficacy than monotherapy in cardioprotection through the reduction of cardiac iron deposition and improved cardiac mitochondrial function in iron-overloaded rats."

Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent nowadays used for the treatment of diarrhea. This study aimed to characterize ciprofloxacin resistant ETEC strains isolated from diarrheal patients in Bangladesh. Methods A total of 8580 stool specimens from diarrheal patients attending the icddr,b Dhaka hospital was screened for ETEC between 2005 and 2009. PCR and Ganglioside GM1- Enzyme Linked Immuno sorbent Assay (ELISA) was used for detection of Heat labile (LT) and Heat stable (ST) toxins of ETEC. Antimicrobial susceptibilities for commonly used antibiotics and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin were examined. DNA sequencing of representative ciprofloxacin resistant strains was performed to analyze mutations of the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. PCR was used for the detection of qnr, a plasmid mediated ciprofloxacin resistance gene. Clonal variations among ciprofloxacin resistant (CipR) and ciprofloxacin susceptible (CipS) strains were determined by Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results Among 1067 (12%) ETEC isolates identified, 42% produced LT/ST, 28% ST and 30% LT alone. Forty nine percent (n = 523) of the ETEC strains expressed one or more of the 13 tested colonization factors (CFs) as determined by dot blot immunoassay. Antibiotic resistance of the ETEC strains was observed as follows: ampicillin 66%, azithromycin 27%, ciprofloxacin 27%, ceftriazone 13%, cotrimaxazole 46%, doxycycline 44%, erythromycin 96%, nalidixic acid 83%, norfloxacin 27%, streptomycin 48% and tetracycline 42%. Resistance to ciprofloxacin increased from 13% in 2005 to 34% in 2009. None of the strains was resistant to mecillinam. The MIC of the nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin of representative CipR strains were 256 μg/ml and 32μg/ml respectively. A single mutation (Ser83-Leu) in gyrA was observed in the nalidixic acid resistant ETEC strains. In contrast, double mutation in gyrA (Ser83-Leu, Asp87-Asn) and a single mutation in parC (Glu84-Ly) were found in ciprofloxacin resistant strains. Mutation of gyrB was not found in either the nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin resistant strains. None of the ciprofloxacin resistant strains was found to be positive for the qnr gene. Diverse clones were identified from all ciprofloxacin resistant strains by PFGE analysis in both CF positive and CF negative ETEC strains. Conclusion Emergence of ciprofloxacin resistant ETEC strains results in a major challenge in current treatment strategies of ETEC diarrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2485396919,"Blastomyces dermatitidis and Blastomyces gilchristii are dimorphic fungal pathogens that cause serious pulmonary and systemic infections in humans. Although their natural habitat is in the environment, little is known about their specific ecologic niche(s). Here, we analyzed 25 microsatellite loci from 169 strains collected from various regions throughout their known endemic range in North America, representing the largest and most geographically diverse collection of isolates studied to date. Genetic analysis of multilocus microsatellite data divided the strains into four populations of B. dermatitidis and four populations of B. gilchristii. B. dermatitidis isolates were recovered from areas throughout North America, while the B. gilchristii strains were restricted to Canada and some northern US states. Furthermore, the populations of both species were associated with major freshwater drainage basins. The four B. dermatitidis populations were partitioned among (1) the Nelson River drainage basin, (2) the St. Lawrence River and northeast Atlantic Ocean Seaboard drainage basins, (3) the Mississippi River System drainage basin, and (4) the Gulf of Mexico Seaboard and southeast Atlantic Ocean Seaboard drainage basins. A similar partitioning of the B. gilchristii populations was observed among the more northerly drainage basins only. These associations suggest that the ecologic niche where the sexual reproduction, growth, and dispersal of B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii occur is intimately linked to freshwater systems. For most populations, sexual reproduction was rare enough to produce significant linkage disequilibrium among loci but frequent enough that mating-type idiomorphic ratios were not skewed from 1:1. Furthermore, the evolutionary divergence of B. dermatitidis and B. gilchristii was estimated at 1.9 MYA during the Pleistocene epoch. We suggest that repeated glaciations during the Pleistocene period and resulting biotic refugia may have provided the impetus for speciation as theorized for other species associated with temperate freshwater systems."

Replacement of the Dicer PAZ domain with this engineered Rbfox RRM enables specific degradation of pre-miR-21. The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is the largest family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins. Engineered RRMs with well-defined specificity would provide valuable tools and an exacting test of the current understanding of specificity. We have redesigned the specificity of an RRM using rational methods and demonstrated retargeting of its activity in cells. We engineered the conserved RRM of human Rbfox proteins to specifically bind to the terminal loop of a microRNA precursor (pre-miR-21) with high affinity and inhibit its processing by Drosha and Dicer. We further engineered Giardia Dicer by replacing its PAZ domain with the designed RRM. The reprogrammed enzyme degrades pre-miR-21 specifically in vitro and suppresses mature miR-21 levels in cells, which results in increased expression of the tumor suppressor PDCD4 and significantly decreased viability for cancer cells. The results demonstrate the feasibility of rationally engineering the sequence-specificity of RRMs and of using this ubiquitous platform for diverse biological applications."

https://openalex.org/W2493993308,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are the first proteins involved in cellular DNA repair pathways to be targeted by specific inhibitors for clinical benefit. Tumors harboring genetic defects in homologous recombination (HR), a DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Early phase clinical trials with PARPi have been promising in patients with advanced BRCA1 or BRCA2-associated breast, ovary and prostate cancer and have led to limited approval for treatment of BRCA-deficient ovary cancer. Unlike HR-defective cells, HR-proficient cells manifest very low cytotoxicity when exposed to PARPi, although they mount a DNA damage response. However, the genotoxic effects on normal human cells when agents including PARPi disturb proficient cellular repair processes have not been substantially investigated. We quantified cytogenetic alterations of human cells, including primary lymphoid cells and non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, exposed to PARPi at clinically relevant doses by both sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assays and chromosome spreading. As expected, both olaparib and veliparib effectively inhibited poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR), and caused marked hypersensitivity in HR-deficient cells. Significant dose-dependent increases in SCEs were observed in normal and non-tumorigenic cells with minimal residual PAR activity. Clinically relevant doses of the FDA-approved olaparib led to a marked increase of SCEs (5-10-fold) and chromatid aberrations (2-6-fold). Furthermore, olaparib potentiated SCE induction by cisplatin in normal human cells. Our data have important implications for therapies with regard to sustained genotoxicity to normal cells. Genomic instability arising from PARPi warrants consideration, especially if these agents will be used in people with early stage cancers, in prevention strategies or for non-oncologic indications."
https://openalex.org/W2477718609,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and FGF23 are the primary hormones regulating acute phosphate homeostasis. Human renal proximal tubule cells (RPTECs) were used to characterize the mechanism and signaling pathways of PTH and FGF23 on phosphate transport and the role of the PDZ protein NHERF1 in mediating PTH and FGF23 effects. RPTECs express the NPT2A phosphate transporter, αKlotho, FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4, and the PTH receptor. FGFR1 isoforms are formed from alternate splicing of exon 3 and of exon 8 or 9 in Ir-like loop 3. Exon 3 was absent, but mRNA containing both exons 8 and 9 is present in cytoplasm. Using an FGFR1c-specific antibody together with mass spectrometry analysis, we show that RPTECs express FGFR-β1C. The data are consistent with regulated FGFR1 splicing involving a novel cytoplasmic mechanism. PTH and FGF23 inhibited phosphate transport in a concentration-dependent manner. At maximally effective concentrations, PTH and FGF23 equivalently decreased phosphate uptake and were not additive, suggesting a shared mechanism of action. Protein kinase A or C blockade prevented PTH but not FGF23 actions. Conversely, inhibiting SGK1, blocking FGFR dimerization, or knocking down Klotho expression disrupted FGF23 actions but did not interfere with PTH effects. C-terminal FGF23(180–251) competitively and selectively blocked FGF23 action without disrupting PTH effects. However, both PTH and FGF23-sensitive phosphate transport were abolished by NHERF1 shRNA knockdown. Extended treatment with PTH or FGF23 down-regulated NPT2A without affecting NHERF1. We conclude that FGFR1c and PTHR signaling pathways converge on NHERF1 to inhibit PTH- and FGF23-sensitive phosphate transport and down-regulate NPT2A. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and FGF23 are the primary hormones regulating acute phosphate homeostasis.

RPTECs express the NPT2A phosphate transporter, αKlotho, FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4, and the PTH receptor. FGFR1 isoforms are formed from alternate splicing of exon 3 and of exon 8 or 9 in Ir-like loop 3. Exon 3 was absent, but mRNA containing both exons 8 and 9 is present in cytoplasm. Using an FGFR1c-specific antibody together with mass spectrometry analysis, we show that RPTECs express FGFR-β1C. The data are consistent with regulated FGFR1 splicing involving a novel cytoplasmic mechanism. PTH and FGF23 inhibited phosphate transport in a concentration-dependent manner. At maximally effective concentrations, PTH and FGF23 equivalently decreased phosphate uptake and were not additive, suggesting a shared mechanism of action. Protein kinase A or C blockade prevented PTH but not FGF23 actions. Conversely, inhibiting SGK1, blocking FGFR dimerization, or knocking down Klotho expression disrupted FGF23 actions but did not interfere with PTH effects. C-terminal FGF23(180–251) competitively and selectively blocked FGF23 action without disrupting PTH effects. However, both PTH and FGF23-sensitive phosphate transport were abolished by NHERF1 shRNA knockdown. Extended treatment with PTH or FGF23 down-regulated NPT2A without affecting NHERF1. We conclude that FGFR1c and PTHR signaling pathways converge on NHERF1 to inhibit PTH- and FGF23-sensitive phosphate transport and down-regulate NPT2A."
https://openalex.org/W2491528806,"Background The glucuronoyl esterase enzymes of wood-degrading fungi (Carbohydrate Esterase family 15; CE15) form part of the hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzyme systems that break down plant biomass, and have possible applications in biotechnology. Homologous enzymes are predicted in the genomes of several bacteria, however these have been much less studied than their fungal counterparts. Here we describe the recombinant production and biochemical characterization of a bacterial CE15 enzyme denoted MZ0003, which was identified by in silico screening of a prokaryotic metagenome library derived from marine Arctic sediment. MZ0003 has high similarity to several uncharacterized gene products of polysaccharide-degrading bacterial species, and phylogenetic analysis indicates a deep evolutionary split between these CE15s and fungal homologs. Results MZ0003 appears to differ from previously-studied CE15s in some aspects. Some glucuronoyl esterase activity could be measured by qualitative thin-layer chromatography which confirms its assignment as a CE15, however MZ0003 can also hydrolyze a range of other esters, including p-nitrophenyl acetate, which is not acted upon by some fungal homologs. The structure of MZ0003 also appears to differ as it is predicted to have several large loop regions that are absent in previously studied CE15s, and a combination of homology-based modelling and site-directed mutagenesis indicate its catalytic residues deviate from the conserved Ser-His-Glu triad of many fungal CE15s. Taken together, these results indicate that potentially unexplored diversity exists among bacterial CE15s, and this may be accessed by investigation of the microbial metagenome. The combination of low activity on typical glucuronoyl esterase substrates, and the lack of glucuronic acid esters in the marine environment suggest that the physiological substrate of MZ0003 and its homologs is likely to be different from that of related fungal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2506805096,"Structural and biochemical studies of the Notch O-glucosyltransferase Rumi in complex with its substrates inform on the catalytic mechanism for Rumi substrate recognition, and characterization of cancer mutations in Rumi reveals loss of enzyme activity. Rumi O-glucosylates the EGF repeats of a growing list of proteins essential in metazoan development, including Notch. Rumi is essential for Notch signaling, and Rumi dysregulation is linked to several human diseases. Despite Rumi's critical roles, it is unknown how Rumi glucosylates a serine of many but not all EGF repeats. Here we report crystal structures of Drosophila Rumi as binary and ternary complexes with a folded EGF repeat and/or donor substrates. These structures provide insights into the catalytic mechanism and show that Rumi recognizes structural signatures of the EGF motif, the U-shaped consensus sequence, C-X-S-X-(P/A)-C and a conserved hydrophobic region. We found that five Rumi mutations identified in cancers and Dowling–Degos disease are clustered around the enzyme active site and adversely affect its activity. Our study suggests that loss of Rumi activity may underlie these diseases, and the mechanistic insights may facilitate the development of modulators of Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2491497270,"A recent study reported that Acinetobacter baumannii could induce autophagy, but the recognition and clearance mechanism of intracytosolic A. baumannii in the autophagic process and the molecular mechanism of autophagy induced by the pathogen remains unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that invading A. baumannii induced a complete, ubiquitin-mediated autophagic response that is dependent upon septins SEPT2 and SEPT9 in mammalian cells. We also demonstrated that autophagy induced by A. baumannii was Beclin-1 dependent via the AMPK/ERK/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Of interest, we found that the isochorismatase mutant strain had significantly decreased siderophore-mediated ferric iron acquisition ability and had a reduced the ability to induce autophagy. We verified that isochorismatase was required for the recognition of intracytosolic A. baumannii mediated by septin cages, ubiquitinated proteins, and ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins p62 and NDP52 in autophagic response. We also confirmed that isochorismatase was required for the clearance of invading A. baumannii by autophagy in vitro and in the mouse model of infection. Together, these findings provide insight into the distinctive recognition and clearance of intracytosolic A. baumannii by autophagy in host cells, and that isochorismatase plays a critical role in the A. baumannii-induced autophagic process.-Wang, Y., Zhang, K., Shi, X., Wang, C., Wang, F., Fan, J., Shen, F., Xu, J., Bao, W., Liu, M., Yu, L.

https://openalex.org/W2491729490,"Hospitalization rates over time of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) provide insight into the burden of unfavorable health conditions on CCS and health care resources. The objective of our study was to examine trends in hospitalizations of CCS and risk factors in comparison with the general population. We performed a medical record linkage study of a cohort of 1564 ≥five-year CCS with national registers. We obtained a random sample of the general population matched on year of birth, gender and calendar year per CCS retrieved. We quantified and compared hospitalization rates of CCS and reference persons from 1995 until 2005, and we analyzed risk factors for hospitalization within the CCS cohort with multivariable Poisson models. We retrieved hospitalization information from 1382 CCS and 25583 reference persons. The overall relative hospitalization rate (RHR) was 2.2 (95%CI:1.9–2.5) for CCS compared to reference persons. CCS with central nervous system and solid tumors had highest RHRs. Hospitalization rates in CCS were increased compared to reference persons up to at least 30 years after primary diagnosis, with highest rates 5–10 and 20–30 years after primary cancer. RHRs were highest for hospitalizations due to neoplasms (10.7; 95%CI:7.1–16.3) and endocrine/nutritional/metabolic disorders (7.3; 95%CI:4.6–11.7). Female gender (P<0.001), radiotherapy to head and/or neck (P<0.001) or thorax and/or abdomen (P = 0.03) and surgery (P = 0.01) were associated with higher hospitalization rates in CCS. In conclusion, CCS have increased hospitalization rates compared to the general population, up to at least 30 years after primary cancer treatment. These findings imply a high and long-term burden of unfavorable health conditions after childhood cancer on survivors and health care resources."
https://openalex.org/W2489235419,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here the effects of severe penetrating TBI on APP and tau cleavage processing were investigated in a rodent model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). PBBI was induced by stereotactically inserting a perforated steel probe through the right frontal cortex of the anesthetized rat and rapidly inflating/deflating the probe’s elastic tubing into an elliptical shaped balloon to 10% of total rat brain volume causing temporary cavitation injury. Separate animals underwent probe injury (PrI) alone without balloon inflation. Shams underwent craniectomy. Brain tissue was collected acutely (4h, 24h, 3d) and subacutely (7d) post-injury and analyzed by immunoblot for full length APP (APP-FL) and APP beta c-terminal fragments (βCTFs), full length tau (tau-FL) and tau truncation fragments and at 7d for cytotoxic Beta amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 analysis. APP-FL was significantly decreased at 3d and 7d following PBBI whereas APP βCTFs were significantly elevated by 4h post-injury and remained elevated through 7d post-injury. Effects on βCTFs were mirrored with PrI, albeit to a lesser extent. Aβ40 and Aβ42 were significantly elevated at 7d following PBBI and PrI. Tau-FL decreased substantially 3d and 7d post-PBBI and PrI. Importantly, a 22 kDa tau fragment (tau22), similar to that found in AD, was significantly elevated by 4h and remained elevated through 7d post-injury. Thus both APP and tau cleavage was dramatically altered in the acute and subacute periods post-injury. As cleavage of these proteins has also been implicated in AD, TBI pathology shown here may set the stage for the later development of AD or other tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2477490772,"Since the discovery of cell-free foetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women, many non-invasive prenatal testing assays have been developed. In the area of skeletal dysplasia diagnosis, some PCR-based non-invasive prenatal testing assays have been developed to facilitate the ultrasound diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias that are caused by de novo mutations. However, skeletal dysplasias are a group of heterogeneous genetic diseases, the PCR-based method is hard to detect multiple gene or loci simultaneously, and the diagnosis rate is highly dependent on the accuracy of the ultrasound diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using targeted capture sequencing to detect foetal de novo pathogenic mutations responsible for skeletal dysplasia.Three families whose foetuses were affected by skeletal dysplasia and two control families whose foetuses were affected by other single gene diseases were included in this study. Sixteen genes related to some common lethal skeletal dysplasias were selected for analysis, and probes were designed to capture the coding regions of these genes. Targeted capture sequencing was performed on the maternal plasma DNA, the maternal genomic DNA, and the paternal genomic DNA. The de novo pathogenic variants in the plasma DNA data were identified using a bioinformatical process developed for low frequency mutation detection and a strict variant interpretation strategy. The causal variants could be specifically identified in the plasma, and the results were identical to those obtained by sequencing amniotic fluid samples. Furthermore, a mean of 97% foetal specific alleles, which are alleles that are not shared by maternal genomic DNA and amniotic fluid DNA, were identified successfully in plasma samples.Our study shows that capture sequencing of maternal plasma DNA can be used to non-invasive detection of de novo pathogenic variants. This method has the potential to be used to facilitate the prenatal diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2479673172,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung disorder characterized by the progressive obstruction of airflow and is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world. The pathogenesis of COPD is thought to involve bacterial infections and inflammations. Owing to advancement in sequencing technology, evidence is emerging that supports an association between the lung microbiome and COPD. However, few studies have looked into the expression profile of the bacterial communities in the COPD lungs. In this study, we analyzed the sputum microbiome of four moderate and four severe COPD male patients both at the DNA and RNA level, using next generation sequencing technology. We found that bacterial composition determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing may not directly translate to the set of actively expressing bacteria as defined by transcriptome sequencing. The two sequencing data agreed on Prevotella, Rothia, Neisseria, Porphyromonas, Veillonella, Fusobacterium and Streptococcus being among the most differentially abundant genera between the moderate and severe COPD samples, supporting their association with COPD severity. However, the two sequencing analyses disagreed on the relative abundance of these bacteria in the two COPD groups, implicating the importance of studying the actively expressing bacteria for enriching our understanding of COPD. Though we have described the metatranscriptome profiles of the lung microbiome in moderate and severe COPD, further investigations are required to determine the functional basis underlying the relationship between the microbial species in the lungs and pathogenesis of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2481740791,"The replacement of one Gly in the essential repeating tripeptide sequence of the type I collagen triple helix results in the dominant hereditary bone disorder osteogenesis imperfecta. The mechanism leading to pathology likely involves misfolding and autophagy, although it has been hypothesized that some mutations interfere with known collagen interactions. Here, the effect of Gly replacements within and nearby the integrin binding GFPGER sequence was investigated using a recombinant bacterial collagen system. When a six-triplet human type I collagen sequence containing GFPGER was introduced into a bacterial collagen-like protein, this chimeric protein bound to integrin. Constructs with Gly to Ser substitutions within and nearby the inserted human sequence still formed a trypsin-resistant triple helix, suggesting a small local conformational perturbation. Gly to Ser mutations within the two Gly residues in the essential GFPGER sequence prevented integrin binding and cell attachment as predicted from molecular dynamics studies of the complex. Replacement of Gly residues C-terminal to GFPGER did not affect integrin binding. In contrast, Gly replacements N-terminal to the GFPGER sequence, up to four triplets away, decreased integrin binding and cell adhesion. This pattern suggests either an involvement of the triplets N-terminal to GFPGER in initial binding or a propagation of the perturbation of the triple helix C-terminal to a mutation site. The asymmetry in biological consequences relative to the mutation site may relate to the observed pattern of osteogenesis imperfecta mutations near the integrin binding site."

High resolution 13C NMR spectra of plasma triacylglycerols and glucose provided new insights into a number of hepatic processes including fatty acid esterification, the pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Recently methods were introduced to study hepatic PPP by analysis of plasma glucose and hepatic fatty acid esterification in rodents receiving intragastric 13C-labeled glycerol (15Jin E.S.

After the administration of [U-13C3]glycerol, different metabolic pathways in the liver generate unique 13C-labeling patterns in the products of hepatic biosynthesis, glucose and TAGs, that are exported into circulation and readily sampled in venous blood. The 13C-labeling patterns provide a rich source of information regarding multiple pathways including fatty acid esterification, gluconeogenesis, the PPP, and TCA cycle activity. Direct conversion of [U-13C3]glycerol to either glucose or TAGs retains the intact 13C-unit of three covalently bonded carbons (13C-13C-13C) of the original glycerol. Metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol in the TCA cycle followed by resynthesis to a triose during gluconeogenesis yields a double-labeled (13C-13C) triose. Thus, the detection of glucose or glycerol derived from a double-labeled triose indicates metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol through the TCA cycle prior to formation of these products. In addition, the difference in labeling patterns between glucose carbons 1–3 versus carbons 4–6 after the administration of [U-13C3]glycerol provides an index of hepatic PPP activity. The oxidative arm of the PPP rearranges carbons 1–3 but not carbons 4–6. The details of these pathways are illustrated in Fig. 1. Here we investigated the metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol in human subjects to test the hypothesis that a portion of glycerol is metabolized in the TCA cycle prior to glyceroneogenesis or gluconeogenesis. Healthy volunteers ingested [U-13C3]glycerol under differing nutritional states. Blood was drawn at multiple times, and metabolites from blood were analyzed using 13C NMR. In addition to fasted and fed conditions, we evaluated the consequences of a bolus of oral glucose (here termed “fed plus glucose”) to determine whether a high concentration of glucose would stimulate hepatic PPP to supply NADPH needed for fatty acid synthesis. Although the majority of the carbon backbones of TAGs was directly derived from [U-13C3]glycerol, ∼5–20% was derived after metabolism of glycerol in the TCA cycle. Glycerol metabolism in the TCA cycle and PPP activity were both more active in the fasted state compared with the fed states. Key metabolic processes in the liver of human subjects including glycerol metabolism in the TCA cycle, the PPP, and fatty acid esterification were sensitive to nutritional states, and these processes were detected using a protocol that requires only oral administration of glycerol and venous blood samples. This assay is convenient and acceptable to human subjects, and in a single exam it detects metabolic pathways in the liver that were previously inaccessible in a simple assay. The effects of nutritional states on the concentrations of plasma glycerol, fatty acids, and TAGs are shown in Fig. 2 (a–c). The 13C NMR spectra of plasma metabolites were sensitive to nutritional states. Under all conditions, the13C NMR spectra of plasma lipids showed well resolved resonances of the glycerol moiety of TAGs (Fig. 3a). The singlet (S) from carbon 1 (C1) and C3 resonance at 62.2 ppm reflects signals from single-labeled ([1-13C1] and [3-13C1]) glycerol, whereas the doublet (D) reflects contributions from double- and triple-labeled ([1,2-13C2], [2,3-13C2], and [U-13C3]) glycerol moieties. Given the low probability of forming a single-labeled glycerol moiety from exogenous [U-13C3]glycerol, the singlet was assumed to represent natural abundance 13C (1.1%). The time course of 13C enrichment in the glycerol backbones of TAGs was sensitive to nutritional states. Under a fast, 13C enrichment in the glycerol backbones rapidly increased, reaching a maximum (7.1%) at 90 min after [U-13C3]glycerol ingestion, followed by gradual decrease. Under the fed or the fed plus glucose condition, the enrichment gradually increased, reaching a plateau at 120–150 min. (Fig. 2d). The concentration of TAGs with excess 13C-labeled glycerol moiety indicates newly synthesized TAGs from the liver exported into the circulation and was calculated by multiplying [TAG] and the fraction of glycerol moiety with excess 13C (Fig. 2e). The maximum concentration occurred early under both the fasted and fed states, but it steadily increased up to 240 min under the fed plus glucose condition.FIGURE 313C NMR spectra of the glycerol moiety of TAGs reflect direct and indirect contributions from [U-13C3]glycerol. Healthy subjects ingested [U-13C3]glycerol under differing nutritional states, and blood was drawn at multiple times. a, 13C NMR spectra of lipid extracts from a fasted subject show the resonances of the glycerol backbones of TAGs. The spectrum from 10 min shows natural abundance 13C only, but the spectra from 60, 120, and 240 min show signals from excess 13C in the glycerol backbones. In the C1 and C3 region at 62.2 ppm, the doublet (D) reflects signals from [1,2-13C2]-, [2,3-13C2]-, and [U-13C3]glycerol moieties of TAGs. In the C2 region at 69.1 ppm, the doublet (D) reflects [1,2-13C2]- and [2,3-13C2]glycerol moieties, and the triplet (T) arises exclusively from [U-13C3]glycerol moiety. The presence of double-labeled glycerol demonstrates metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol in the TCA cycle prior to glyceroneogenesis. b, the direct versus indirect contribution from [U-13C3]glycerol was estimated based on the analysis of the glycerol moiety C2 resonance. [U-13C3]Glycerol incorporation to TAGs occurred primarily via the direct pathway under all nutritional conditions. The indirect contribution through the TCA cycle was minor but increased gradually over time and was sensitive to nutritional states. The indirect contribution was 22% after a fast, 13% under a fed condition, and 10% under a fed plus glucose condition at 240 min of the ingestion.

As noted, [U-13C3]glycerol metabolism directly to TAGs only produces an intact triple-labeled unit (13C-13C-13C), yet double-labeled units (13C-13C) are also produced through the TCA cycle prior to glyceroneogenesis. Thus, any signal arising from the doublet must reflect the indirect contribution of [U-13C3]glycerol to TAGs after metabolism in the TCA cycle. The indirect contribution increased over time under all nutritional states but was ∼2-fold greater after a fast. At 240 min after [U-13C3]glycerol ingestion, the indirect contribution was 22% in the fasting state, 13% in the fed state, and 10% in the fed plus glucose state (Fig. 3b). The indirect contributions at 10 and 30 min were not measured because of low 13C enrichments. The concentration of plasma glucose remained constant after [U-13C3]glycerol ingestion in both the fasted and fed conditions but increased in the fed plus glucose condition at 10–60 min (Fig. 4a). In 13C NMR spectra of monoacetone glucose derived from plasma glucose, signals from [1,2,3-13C3]- and [4,5,6-13C3]glucose were dominant under all nutritional states, reflecting gluconeogenesis directly from [U-13C3]glycerol (Fig. 5). The presence of double-labeled ([1,2-13C2], [2,3-13C2], [4,5-13C2], and [5,6-13C2]) glucose isotopomers demonstrates the metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol through the TCA cycle prior to gluconeogenesis and is consistent with the observation in the glycerol backbones of TAGs. The sum of all glucose isotopomers with excess 13C, indicating gluconeogenesis from [U-13C3]glycerol, was much higher after a fast compared with fed or fed plus glucose conditions (Fig. 4b). The difference between [1,2-13C2]/[2,3-13C2] and [5,6-13C2]/[4,5-13C2] ratios in glucose (reflecting PPP activity) was higher in the fasting than in the fed conditions (Fig. 4c). The amount of [1,2-13C2]glucose produced through the PPP, on the order of 1–40 μmol/liter, was much higher after a fast compared with the fed states (Fig. 4d). Nonetheless, the fraction of [1,2-13C2]glucose from the PPP was still less than 1% of plasma glucose pool even under fasting. When the PPP flux was compared with gluconeogenesis from [U-13C3]glycerol, it was ∼5–6% after a fast and ∼3% under fed states (Table 1).FIGURE 513C NMR spectra of plasma glucose reflect hepatic gluconeogenesis and PPP activity. A subject ingested [U-13C3]glycerol under differing nutritional states, and blood was drawn at multiple times. Glucose was derivatized for 13C NMR acquisition, and the spectra are from blood drawn at 180 min after [U-13C3]glycerol ingestion. Gluconeogenesis directly from [U-13C3]glycerol produced [1,2,3-13C3]- and [4,5,6-13C3]glucose. [U-13C3]Glycerol metabolism through the TCA cycle prior to gluconeogenesis produced double-labeled glucose ([1,2-13C2], [2,3-13C2], [5,6-13C2], and [4,5-13C2]). Hepatic PPP activity produced additional [1,2-13C2]glucose, which was greatest under a fast. The ratio difference between D12/D23 versus D56/D45 (i.e. [1,2-13C2]/[2,3-13C2] versus [5,6-13C2]/[4,5-13C2] in glucose) reflects hepatic PPP activity, which was sensitive to nutritional states.

through gluconeogenesis from [U-13C3]glycerol (n = 5–6). Open table in a new tab Metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol through the TCA cycle is reflected as doublets because of [1,2-13C2]glucose, [2,3-13C2]glucose, [4,5-13C2]glucose, and [5,6-13C2]glucose. Because [1,2-13C2]glucose and [2,3-13C2]glucose are sensitive to flux through the PPP, [5,6-13C2]glucose is a useful marker for metabolism of [U-13C3]glycerol through the TCA cycle because the signal from [4,5-13C2]glucose is small (Fig. 5). The fraction of [5,6-13C2]glucose in plasma glucose was much higher after a fast than fed states. The minimal [5,6-13C2]glucose production under the fed plus glucose condition was presumably due to suppression of gluconeogenesis by the glucose load in these healthy subjects (Fig. 4e). This study demonstrated that [U-13C3]glycerol is a useful and convenient probe of multiple key metabolic processes in the liver of human subjects. The utility arises from the combined features of negligible toxicity, ease of oral administration, the ability to access de novo synthesis of both glucose and TAGs under various nutritional states, and the abundant information yield arising from 13C-13C spin-spin couplings of the metabolic products in plasma. We demonstrated that the fraction of plasma glucose reflecting the PPP activity was very low in these healthy patients under all conditions and that fasting increases hepatic PPP activity, gluconeogenesis from glycerol, and glycerol metabolism through the TCA cycle prior to gluconeogenesis. TAG synthesis and secretion to the bloodstream was continuous under the fed plus glucose condition but transient under a fast. This study also demonstrated for the first time that a significant fraction of the backbones of TAGs derived from an oral glycerol load was metabolized through the TCA cycle prior to glyceroneogenesis in the liver of human subjects. This is the first report to assess hepatic PPP in human subjects after oral administration of a gluconeogenic, stable isotope substrate. Typically 13C-labeled glucose tracers have been used in isolated livers or hepatocytes to estimate PPP activity. For example, [1,2-13C2]glucose is converted to [2,3-13C2]lactate and unlabeled lactate via glycolysis but generates [3-13C1]lactate and unlabeled lactate after passage through the PPP. However, glucose tracers have limited utility in vivo for analysis of hepatic metabolism because glucose is potentially consumed by essentially all the organs of the body. Magnusson et al. (17Magnusson I. Chandramouli V. Schumann W.C. Kumaran K. Wahren J. Landau B.R. Pentose pathway in human liver.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4682-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) used radioactive tracers, [1-14C1]ribose and [2-14C1]glucose, and drugs, diflunisal and acetaminophen, to detect hepatic PPP activity in humans by analyzing glucuronides in urine. The use of radioactive tracers is a disadvantage because of safety and ethical concerns and the technical requirements for radiation containment. Furthermore, the drugs used to capture glucuronides may themselves alter PPP activity because the liver is the primary organ for detoxification of these probes. We analyzed glucose secreted from the liver receiving [U-13C3]glycerol and assumed that the liver is the dominant gluconeogenic organ in healthy humans. Glycerol is safe, and high doses (≥1 g/kg) of glycerol are commonly used for studies of exercise performance (18Massicotte D. Scotto A. Péronnet F. M'Kaouar H. Milot M. Lavoie C.

In the current study, a much lower dose (50 mg/kg) of 13C-labeled glycerol produced high quality spectra of plasma metabolites of interest. The major products of the PPP are NADPH and ribose. NADPH is a reducing agent, and ribose is essential for nucleotide synthesis. With this low dose of glycerol, we observed an increase in PPP activity during a fast that could be attributed to the increased need for NADPH for reduction of glutathione, a major antioxidant, because calorie restriction induces glutathione in the liver ("

It is organized as a dimer, with each monomer consisting of more than 20 subunits as well as several cofactors, including chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, lipids, and ions. The isolation of stable and homogeneous PSII supercomplexes from plants has been a hindrance for their deep structural and functional characterization. In recent years, purification of complexes with different antenna sizes was achieved with mild detergent solubilization of photosynthetic membranes and fractionation on a sucrose gradient, but these preparations were only stable in the cold for a few hours. In this work, we present an improved protocol to obtain plant PSII supercomplexes that are stable for several hours/days at a wide range of temperatures and can be concentrated without degradation. Biochemical and spectroscopic properties of the purified PSII are presented, as well as a study of the complex solubility in the presence of salts. We also tested the impact of a large panel of detergents on PSII stability and found that very few are able to maintain the integrity of PSII. Such new PSII preparation opens the possibility of performing experiments that require room temperature conditions and/or high protein concentrations, and thus it will allow more detailed investigations into the structure and molecular mechanisms that underlie plant PSII function.

We investigated the effect of adjuvant CHPs in preventing ischemic stroke in patients with AF. Methods Taiwanese patients in the Health Insurance Database newly diagnosed with AF during 2000–2011 were enrolled. Medication treatment with/without CHPs was administered within 7 days after the AF diagnosis. The clinical endpoint was an ischemic stroke. The Chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, and Student t test were used to examine differences between the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and non-TCM cohorts. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess the risk for ischemic stroke between two cohorts. Results Three hundred and eleven patients underwent TCM treatment and 1715 patients did not. Compared to non-TCM users, TCM users had a lower incidence of stroke (12.59% vs. 1.93%, respectively) and lower risk of stroke [CHA2DS2-VASc score = 0–2 (hazard ratio = 0.20; 95% confidence interval = 0.06–0.65)]. Compared to non-TCM users, the stroke risk was significantly lower in TCM users with AF who were female or younger than 65 years, but not in males, people more than 65 years old, or people with comorbidities. Compared to TCM users, non-TCM users who received conventional treatment had a higher ischemic stroke risk. The risk for AF-related hospitalization was significantly lower in TCM users (0.64%) than in non-TCM users (38.1%). Conclusions Users of TCM with AF have a lower risk of new-onset ischemic stroke. Therefore, adjuvant CHP therapy may have a protective effect and may be used in AF patients to prevent ischemic stroke."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, UBI4 encodes five tandem ubiquitin monomers and is essential for growth in zinc-deficient conditions. Although UBI4 is only one of four ubiquitin-encoding genes in the genome, a dramatic decrease in ubiquitin was observed in zinc-deficient ubi4Δ cells. The three other ubiquitin genes were strongly repressed under these conditions, contributing to the decline in ubiquitin. In a screen for ubi4Δ suppressors, a hypomorphic allele of the RPT2 proteasome regulatory subunit gene (rpt2E301K) suppressed the ubi4Δ growth defect. The rpt2E301K mutation also increased ubiquitin accumulation in zinc-deficient cells, and by using a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate we found that proteasome activity was reduced. These results suggested that increased ubiquitin supply in suppressed ubi4Δ cells was a consequence of more efficient ubiquitin release and recycling during proteasome degradation. Degradation of a ubiquitin-dependent substrate was restored by the rpt2E301K mutation, indicating that ubiquitination is rate-limiting in this process. The UBI4 gene was induced ∼5-fold in low zinc and is regulated by the zinc-responsive Zap1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, Zap1 controls UBI4 by inducing transcription from an intragenic promoter, and the resulting truncated mRNA encodes only two of the five ubiquitin repeats. Expression of a short transcript alone complemented the ubi4Δ mutation, indicating that it is efficiently translated.

https://openalex.org/W2476059303,"MicroRNAs have emerged as ubiquitous post-transcriptional regulators that coordinate many fundamental processes within cells, including those commonly linked to cancer when dysregulated. Profiling microRNAs across stages of cancer progression provides focus as to which microRNAs are key players in cancer development and are therefore important to manipulate with interventions to delay cancer onset and progression. Calorie restriction is one of the most effective preventive interventions across many types of cancer, although its effects on microRNAs have not been well characterized. We used the dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene-induced model of luminal mammary cancer in Sprague Dawley rats to elucidate which microRNAs are linked to progression in this type of cancer and, subsequently, to study how calorie restriction affects such microRNAs. We identified eight microRNAs (miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-21, miR-124, miR-125b, miR-126, miR-145 and miR-200a) to be associated with DMBA-induced mammary tumor progression. Calorie restriction, which greatly increased tumor-free survival and decreased the overall size of tumors that did develop, significantly decreased the expression of one microRNA, miR-200a, which was positively associated with tumor progression. We further showed that inhibition of miR-200a function, mimicking the effect of calorie restriction on this microRNA, inhibited proliferation in both rat (LA7) and human (MCF7) luminal mammary cancer cell lines. These findings present, for the first time, a stage-specific profile of microRNAs in a rodent model of luminal mammary cancer. Furthermore, we have identified the regulation of miR-200a, a microRNA that is positively associated with progression in this model, as a possible mechanism contributing to the anticancer effects of calorie restriction."

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and dasatinib inhibit fludarabine and cytarabine uptake. We assessed interactions of bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib with recombinant hNTs (hENT1, 2; hCNT1, -2, and -3) produced individually in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nilotinib inhibited hENT1-mediated uridine transport most potently (IC50 value, 0.7 μm) followed by ponatinib > bosutinib > dasatinib > imatinib. Imatinib inhibited hCNT2 with an IC50 value of 2.3 μm. Ponatinib inhibited all five hNTs with the greatest effect seen for hENT1 (IC50 value, 9 μm). TKIs inhibited [3H]uridine uptake in a competitive manner. Studies in yeast with mutants at two amino acid residues of hENT1 (L442I, L442T, M33A, M33A/L442I) previously shown to be involved in uridine and dipyridamole binding, suggested that BCR-ABL TKIs interacted with Met33 (TM1) and Leu442 (TM11) residues of hENT1. In cultured human CEM lymphoblastoid cells, which possess a single hNT type (hENT1), accumulation of [3H]cytarabine, [3H]cladribine, or [3H]fludarabine was reduced by each of the five TKIs, and also caused a reduction in cell surface expression of hENT1 protein. In conclusion, BCR-ABL TKIs variously inhibit five different hNTs, cause a decrease in cell surface hENT1 expression, and decrease uridine accumulation when presented together with uridine or when given before uridine.

https://openalex.org/W2489832442,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is generally thought to be involved in affect and emotional processing; however, the specific contribution of each hemisphere continues to be debated. In the present study, we employed unilateral tDCS to test the unique contribution of left DLPFC in the encoding and retrieval of emotional stimuli in healthy subjects. Forty-two right handed undergraduate students received either anodal, cathodal or sham stimulation of left DLPFC while viewing neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant pictures. After completing a filler task, participants were asked to remember as many pictures as possible. Results showed that participants were able to remember a larger amount of emotional (both pleasant and unpleasant) pictures than of neutral ones, regardless of the type of tDCS condition. Participants who received anodal stimulation recalled a significantly higher number of pleasant images than participants in the sham and cathodal conditions, while no differences emerged in the recall of neutral and unpleasant pictures. We conclude that our results provide some support to the role of left prefrontal cortex in the encoding and retrieval of pleasant stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2505984166,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a globally distributed human pathogen that leads to both self-limited and chronic infections. At least eight genotypes (A-H) with distinct geographical allocations and phylodynamic behaviors have been described. They differ substantially in many virological and probably some clinical parameters. The aim of this study was to analyze full-length HBV genome sequences from individuals with symptomatic acute HBV infections using phylogenetic and coalescent methods. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in the following subgenotype distribution: F1b (52.7%), A2 (18.2%), F4 (18.2%) and A1, B2, D3 and F2a 1.8% each. These results contrast with those previously reported from chronic infections, where subgenotypes F1b, F4, A2 and genotype D were evenly distributed. This differential distribution might be related to recent internal migrations and/or intrinsic biological features of each viral genotype that could impact on the probability of transmission. The coalescence analysis showed that after a diversification process started in the 80s, the current sequences of subgenotype F1b were grouped in at least four highly supported lineages, whereas subgenotype F4 revealed a more limited diversification pattern with most lineages without offspring in the present. In addition, the genetic characterization of the studied sequences showed that only two of them presented mutations of clinical relevance at S codifyng region and none at the polymerase catalytic domains. Finally, since the acute infections could be an expression of the genotypes currently being transmitted to new hosts, the predominance of subgenotype F1b might have epidemiological, as well as, clinical relevance due to its potential adverse disease outcome among the chronic cases."
https://openalex.org/W2487021244,"Background Cardiovascular and neural malformations are common sequels of diabetic pregnancies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that maternal hyperglycemia would affect the embryos most shortly after the glucose-sensitive time window at embryonic day (ED) 7.5 in mice. Methods Mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin, treated with slow-release insulin implants and mated. Pregnancy aggravated hyperglycemia. Gene expression profiles were determined in ED8.5 and ED9.5 embryos from diabetic and control mice using Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and deep sequencing. Results Maternal hyperglycemia induced differential regulation of 1,024 and 2,148 unique functional genes on ED8.5 and ED9.5, respectively, mostly in downward direction. Pathway analysis showed that ED8.5 embryos suffered mainly from impaired cell proliferation, and ED9.5 embryos from impaired cytoskeletal remodeling and oxidative phosphorylation (all P ≤ E-5). A query of the Mouse Genome Database showed that 20–25% of the differentially expressed genes were caused by cardiovascular and/or neural malformations, if deficient. Despite high glucose levels in embryos with maternal hyperglycemia and a ~150-fold higher rate of ATP production from glycolysis than from oxidative phosphorylation on ED9.5, ATP production from both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation was reduced to ~70% of controls, implying a shortage of energy production in hyperglycemic embryos. Conclusion Maternal hyperglycemia suppressed cell proliferation during gastrulation and cytoskeletal remodeling during early organogenesis. 20–25% of the genes that were differentially regulated by hyperglycemia were associated with relevant congenital malformations. Unexpectedly, maternal hyperglycemia also endangered the energy supply of the embryo by suppressing its glycolytic capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2486105202,"One of the first steps towards elucidating the biological function of a putative transcriptional regulator is to ascertain its preferred DNA-binding sequences. This may be rapidly and effectively achieved through the application of a combinatorial approach, one involving very large numbers of randomized oligonucleotides and reiterative selection and amplification steps to enrich for high-affinity nucleic acid-binding sequences. Previously, we had developed the novel combinatorial approach Restriction Endonuclease Protection, Selection and Amplification (REPSA), which relies not on the physical separation of ligand-nucleic acid complexes but instead selects on the basis of ligand-dependent inhibition of enzymatic template inactivation, specifically cleavage by type IIS restriction endonucleases. Thus, no prior knowledge of the ligand is required for REPSA, making it more amenable for discovery purposes. Here we describe using REPSA, massively parallel sequencing, and bioinformatics to identify the preferred DNA-binding sites for the transcriptional regulator SbtR, encoded by the TTHA0167 gene from the model extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB8. From the resulting position weight matrix, we can identify multiple operons potentially regulated by SbtR and postulate a biological role for this protein in regulating extracellular transport processes. Our study provides a proof-of-concept for the application of REPSA for the identification of preferred DNA-binding sites for orphan transcriptional regulators and a first step towards determining their possible biological roles."
https://openalex.org/W2500427292,"Naturally occurring canine osteoarthritis represents a welfare issue for affected dogs (Canis familiaris), but is also considered very similar to human osteoarthritis and has therefore been proposed as a model of disease in humans. Central sensitisation is recognized in human osteoarthritis sufferers but identification in dogs is challenging. Electromyographic measurement of responses to nociceptive stimulation represents a potential means of investigating alterations in central nociceptive processing, and has been evaluated in conscious experimental dogs, but is likely to be aversive. Development of a suitable anaesthetic protocol in experimental dogs, which facilitated electrophysiological nociceptive withdrawal reflex assessment, may increase the acceptability of using the technique in owned dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis. Seven purpose bred male hound dogs underwent electromyographic recording sessions in each of three states: acepromazine sedation, alfaxalone sedation, and alfaxalone anaesthesia. Electromyographic responses to escalating mechanical and electrical, and repeated electrical, stimuli were recorded. Subsequently the integral of both early and late rectified responses was calculated. Natural logarithms of the integral values were analysed within and between the three states using multi level modeling. Alfaxalone increased nociceptive thresholds and decreased the magnitude of recorded responses, but characteristics of increasing responses with increasing stimulus magnitude were preserved. Behavioural signs of anxiety were noted in two out of seven dogs during recordings in the acepromazine sedated state. There were few significant differences in response magnitude or nociceptive threshold between the two alfaxalone states. Following acepromazine premedication, induction of anaesthesia with 1–2 mg kg-1 alfaxalone, followed by a continuous rate infusion in the range 0.075–0.1 mg kg-1 min-1 produced suitable conditions to enable assessment of spinal nociceptive processing in dogs, without subjecting them to potentially aversive experiences. This methodology may be appropriate for obtaining electrophysiological nociceptive withdrawal reflex data in client-owned dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2505547135,"The inhibition of apoptotic cell death in T cells through the dysregulated expression of BCL2 family members has been associated with the protection against the development of different autoimmune diseases. However, multiple mechanisms were proposed to be responsible for such protective effect. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the T-cell overexpression of BCL2A1, an anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member without an effect on cell cycle progression, in the development of collagen-induced arthritis. Our results demonstrated an attenuated development of arthritis in these transgenic mice. The protective effect was unrelated to the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells but it was associated with a defective activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in CD4+ cells after in vitro TCR stimulation. In addition, the in vitro and in vivo TH17 differentiation were impaired in BCL2A1 transgenic mice. Taken together, we demonstrated here a previously unknown role for BCL2A1 controlling the activation of CD4+ cells and their differentiation into pathogenic proinflammatory TH17 cells and identified BCL2A1 as a potential target in the control of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2479692973,"Metal complexes might become a new type of promising gene delivery systems because of their low cytotoxicity, structural diversity, controllable aqua- and lipo-solubility, and appropriate density and distribution of positive charges. In this study, Zn2+ complexes (1-10) formed with a series of ligands contained benzimidazole(bzim)were prepared and characterized. They were observed to have different affinities for DNA, dependent on their numbers of positive charges, bzim groups, and coordination structures around Zn2+. The binding induced DNA to condensate into spherical nanoparticles with ~ 50 nm in diameter. The cell transfection efficiency of the DNA nanoparticles was poor, although they were low toxic. The sequential addition of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) TAT(48-60) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) resulted in the large DNA condensates (~ 100 nm in diameter) and the increased cellular uptake. The clathrin-mediated endocytosis was found to be a key cellular uptake pathway of the nanoparticles formed with or without TAT(48-60) or/and PEG. The DNA nanoparticles with TAT(48-60) and PEG was found to have the cell transfection efficiency up to 20% of the commercial carrier Lipofect. These results indicated that a simple Zn2+-bzim complex-based composite system can be developed for efficient and low toxic gene delivery through the combination with PEG and CPPs such as TAT."
https://openalex.org/W2504380125,"Women need multipurpose prevention products (MPTs) that protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and provide contraception. The Population Council has developed a prototype intravaginal ring (IVR) releasing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) MIV-150 (M), zinc acetate (ZA), carrageenan (CG) and levonorgestrel (LNG) (MZCL IVR) to protect against HIV, HSV-2, HPV and unintended pregnancy. Our objective was to evaluate the anti-SHIV-RT activity of MZCL IVR in genital mucosa. First, macaque vaginal tissues were challenged with SHIV-RT in the presence of (i) MIV-150 ± LNG or (ii) vaginal fluids (VF); available from studies completed earlier) collected at various time points post insertion of MZCL and MZC IVRs. Then, (iii) MZCL IVRs (vs. LNG IVRs) were inserted in non-Depo Provera-treated macaques for 24h and VF, genital biopsies, and blood were collected and tissues were challenged with SHIV-RT. Infection was monitored with one step SIV gag qRT-PCR or p27 ELISA. MIV-150 (LCMS/MS, RIA), LNG (RIA) and CG (ELISA) were measured in different compartments. Log-normal generalized mixed linear models were used for analysis. LNG did not affect the anti-SHIV-RT activity of MIV-150 in vitro. MIV-150 in VF from MZC/MZCL IVR-treated macaques inhibited SHIV-RT in vaginal mucosa in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). MIV-150 in vaginal tissue from MZCL IVR-treated animals inhibited ex vivo infection relative to baseline (96%; p<0.0001) and post LNG IVR group (90%, p<0.001). No MIV-150 dose-dependent protection was observed, likely because of high MIV-150 concentrations in all vaginal tissue samples. In cervical tissue, MIV-150 inhibited infection vs. baseline (99%; p<0.05). No cervical tissue was available for MIV-150 measurement. Exposure to LNG IVR did not change tissue infection level. These observations support further development of MZCL IVR as a multipurpose prevention technology to improve women's sexual and reproductive health."
https://openalex.org/W2483986173,"Lysozyme amyloidosis is a hereditary disease in which mutations in the gene coding for lysozyme leads to misfolding and consequently accumulation of amyloid material. To improve understanding of the processes involved we expressed human wild type (WT) lysozyme and the disease-associated variant F57I in the central nervous system (CNS) of a Drosophila melanogaster model of lysozyme amyloidosis, with and without co-expression of serum amyloid p component (SAP). SAP is known to be a universal constituent of amyloid deposits and to associate with lysozyme fibrils. There are clear indications that SAP may play an important role in lysozyme amyloidosis, which requires further elucidation. We found that flies expressing the amyloidogenic variant F57I in the CNS have a shorter lifespan than flies expressing WT lysozyme. We also identified apoptotic cells in the brains of F57I flies demonstrating that the flies' neurological functions are impaired when F57I is expressed in the nerve cells. However, co-expression of SAP in the CNS prevented cell death and restored the F57I flies' lifespan. Thus, SAP has the apparent ability to protect nerve cells from damage caused by F57I. Furthermore, it was found that co-expression of SAP prevented accumulation of insoluble forms of lysozyme in both WT- and F57I-expressing flies. Our findings suggest that the F57I mutation affects the aggregation process of lysozyme resulting in the formation of cytotoxic species and that SAP is able to prevent cell death in the F57I flies by preventing accumulation of toxic F57I structures."
https://openalex.org/W2491848430,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5Δ5,8,11,14,17) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6Δ4,7,10,13,16,19) are nutritionally beneficial to human health. Transgenic production of EPA and DHA in oilseed crops by transferring genes originating from lower eukaryotes, such as microalgae and fungi, has been attempted in recent years. However, the low yield of EPA and DHA produced in these transgenic crops is a major hurdle for the commercialization of these transgenics. Many factors can negatively affect transgene expression, leading to a low level of converted fatty acid products. Among these the codon bias between the transgene donor and the host crop is one of the major contributing factors. Therefore, we carried out codon optimization of a fatty acid delta-6 desaturase gene PinD6 from the fungus Phytophthora infestans, and a delta-9 elongase gene, IgASE1 from the microalga Isochrysis galbana for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis respectively. These are the two key genes encoding enzymes for driving the first catalytic steps in the Δ6 desaturation/Δ6 elongation and the Δ9 elongation/Δ8 desaturation pathways for EPA/DHA biosynthesis. Hence expression levels of these two genes are important in determining the final yield of EPA/DHA. Via PCR-based mutagenesis we optimized the least preferred codons within the first 16 codons at their N-termini, as well as the most biased CGC codons (coding for arginine) within the entire sequences of both genes. An expression study showed that transgenic Arabidopsis plants harbouring the codon-optimized IgASE1 contained 64% more elongated fatty acid products than plants expressing the native IgASE1 sequence, whilst Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the codon optimized PinD6 yielded 20 times more desaturated products than yeast expressing wild-type (WT) PinD6. Thus the codon optimization strategy we developed here offers a simple, effective and low-cost alternative to whole gene synthesis for high expression of foreign genes in yeast and Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2494843104,"Among all glaucoma suspects, eyes with optic nerve head features suspicious or suggestive of early glaucoma are probably those that offer the greatest challenge for clinicians. In contrast with the robust longitudinal data published on ocular hypertension, there is no specific management guideline for these patients. Therefore, evaluating eyes with suspicious optic disc appearance and normal intraocular pressure (IOP), we sought to investigate potential differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics to differentiate those with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) from those with presumed large physiological optic disc cups (pLPC). In this observational case-control study, we consecutively enrolled individuals with pLPC and NTG. All eyes had vertical cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR)≥0.6 and untreated IOP<21 mmHg. Glaucomatous eyes had reproducible visual field defects. Eyes with pLPC required normal visual fields and ≥30 months of follow-up with no evidence of glaucomatous neuropathy. Clinical and epidemiological parameters were compared between groups. Eighty-four individuals with pLPC and 40 NTG patients were included. Regarding our main results, NTG patients were significantly older and with a higher prevalence of Japanese descendants (p<0.01). Not only did pLPC eyes have smaller mean VCDR, but also larger optic discs (p≤0.04). There were no significant differences for gender, central corneal thickness, and spherical equivalent (p≥0.38). Significant odds ratios (OR) were found for race (OR = 2.42; for Japanese ancestry), age (OR = 1.05), VCDR (OR = 5.03), and disc size (OR = 0.04; p≤0.04). In conclusion, in patients with suspicious optic disc and normal IOP, those with older age, Japanese ancestry, smaller optic discs, and larger VCDR are more likely to have NTG, and therefore, deserve deeper investigation and closer monitoring."
