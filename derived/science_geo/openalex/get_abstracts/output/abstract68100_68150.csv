https://openalex.org/W1566163765,"A cell-free system, consisting of particle-free cytoplasm and mitochondria prepared from rat liver, has been used to study the transfer of acetyl groups from the intramitochondrial to the extramitochondrial space during fatty acid synthesis. 14C-Pyruvate, generated from 14C-alanine, was used to generate intramitochondrial 14C-acetyl-CoA. Fatty acid synthesis was followed by measuring the incorporation of 3H2O and 14C. Pool dilution experiments showed that the acetyl group of intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA leaves the mitochondria in the form of citrate, or of a closely related tricarboxylate. (-)-Hydroxycitrate, an inhibitor of citrate cleavage enzyme, strongly inhibits fatty acid synthesis from 14C-alanine. On the other hand, (-)-hydroxycitrate has little or no effect on respiration, phosphorylation, and citrate accumulation during the course of the experiments. n-Butylmalonate, an inhibitor of malate permease, also inhibits fatty acid synthesis. This inhibition is reversed by malate. n-Butylmalonate probably exerts its effect by preventing the activation of α-ketoglutarate and tricarboxylate permeases by malate. It is concluded that citrate is the major carrier in the transfer of acetyl groups from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1593548000,"Abstract Valine apolipoprotein, glutamic acid apolipoprotein, and alanine apolipoprotein (apoLP-Ala) (designated by their COOH-terminal amino acids) are three small apolipoproteins which constitute more than half of the protein in human plasma very low density lipoprotein. These proteins were isolated free of lipid by techniques previously described. As determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and estimated from amino acid analyses, the approximate molecular weights of the apolipoproteins were: valine apolipoprotein, 7,000; glutamic acid apolipoprotein, 10,000; and apoLP-Ala, 10,000. Circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion spectra for valine apolipoprotein were consistent with a high content of α helix, while the spectra obtained with apoLP-Ala suggested its structure to be mainly of random coil. Previously reported polymorphism of apoLP-Ala was found to be attributed to differences in content of sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1508641641,"Abstract Pyruvate decreased the rate of free fatty acid release from rat epididymal adipose tissue incubated in vitro by increasing free fatty acid esterification. The magnitude of the pyruvate effect, tested in tissues from fasted, adrenalectomized, or diabetic rats, closely correlated both with the rate of glyceride-glycerol labeling from radioactive pyruvate and with the activity of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. The addition of 25 mm pyruvate to adipose tissue from 24-hour fasted rats produced a 2-fold increase in free fatty acid esterification. At a lower concentration (0.25 mm) pyruvate had no effect on free fatty acid esterification but butyrate added in equimolar concentrations caused a 50% increase in esterification of free fatty acids in tissue from fasted animals. These findings support the role of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase as a regulatory enzyme in the glyceroneogenic sequence and suggest that glyceroneogenesis is important in adipose tissue for the maintenance of free fatty acid esterification. The role of the adrenals and of insulin in regulating the activity of rat adipose tissue P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is also presented. Diabetes increased the activity of this enzyme in adipose tissue and liver but adrenalectomy superimposed upon diabetes caused a further increase in adipose tissue P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase activity and a reduction in the activity of the hepatic enzyme. Both insulin and triamcinolone reduced the activity of adipose tissue P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in adipose tissue from diabetic-adrenalectomized rats but only when the two hormones were administered simultaneously was the level of the enzyme reduced to normal."
https://openalex.org/W1552064591,"Abstract Putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane), the product of the decarboxylation of ornithine, is a precursor of the polyamines spermidine and spermine. After administration in vivo of radiolabeled ornithine or putrescine, changes in specific activity of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine have been assessed in normal and regenerating liver and in brain. In both normal liver and in brain, after labeling with exogenous putrescine, the specific activity of spermidine declines with a half-life of about 4 days. Following partial hepatectomy, marked and characteristic changes occur in the endogenous levels of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in the regenerating liver of the rat. Putrescine concentration is increased 5-fold as early as 4 hours after the operation, whereas spermidine levels rise more slowly and attain a maximum which is double that of control values within the first 5 days. Spermine concentration declines initially but becomes elevated by 11 days after hepatectomy. In regenerating rat liver, the rate of decline of the labeling of spermidine after administration of 14C-putrescine or 14C-ornithine is the same as in normal liver. There is a very rapid fall (t½ = 2 hours) of the labeling of putrescine in regenerating rat liver after the administration of 14C-ornithine."

https://openalex.org/W1591059220,"Abstract Using Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in culture, we have examined the effects that changes in the composition of the medium exert on the state and activity of the protein-synthesizing apparatus of the cells. During the 24-hour interval between additions of fresh medium to the cultures, glucose was found to be completely utilized and glutamine was appreciably diminished. After the addition of glucose and essential amino acids to such depleted cultures, a 3-fold increase in synthesis per cell was observed. This increase, which occurred over a several hour period, was due to a shift of single ribosomes into polyribosomes and to an increase in the synthesizing activity of the polyribosomes. As glucose became exhausted from the medium after about 15 hours, a reversal of these changes began. These findings indicate that nutritional factors modulate the rate of synthesis through mechanisms, in addition to substrate limitation, operating at the translational level. Both peptide chain initiation and elongation are influenced, probably independently."
https://openalex.org/W1604912786,"Abstract Between pH 8 and pH 5.6 at 20° the oxygen affinity of carp hemoglobin decreases by a factor of more than 100; and at pH 5.6, where the lowest affinity is found, all heme-heme interaction is apparently lost. The kinetic constant which is most affected is the rate of oxygen dissociation, which increases by a factor of about 100, whereas the rate of combination of oxygen decreases by only 3-fold. It appears that the properties of all of the heme groups of the hemoglobin molecule are affected in a nearly identical way by the pH changes. It is suggested that perhaps at low pH the carp hemoglobin molecule fails to undergo the transition to the high affinity or oxygenated hemoglobin structure and remains in the deoxygenated or low affinity structure even when it reacts with oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1551355972,"Abstract The reliability of equilibrium constants and enhancement factors, et, for ternary metal-substrate-enzyme complexes determined by proton relaxation rate titration methods has been examined. Approximations inherent in graphical procedures for analyzing the experimental data have been avoided by obtaining exact numerical solutions for the system of complex equilibria and subjecting the titration data to nonlinear least squares error analysis by computer techniques. Computer analysis of titration data for the adenylate kinase-Mn(II)-ATP system gave values for et significantly different from et values obtained by graphical analysis of the same data; at 42° the computer value for et was 22, to be contrasted with the graphical value of 170. The respective fits of theoretical curves drawn with the graphical and computer constants strongly support the et from the computer analysis as well as the fact that the value of et derived graphically exceeds the theoretical limit. For the Mn(II)-ADP creatine kinase system only a limited region of the saturation curve with respect to ternary complex formation is available for measurement under attainable experimental conditions. Hence, the experimental data obtained at 24° under optimal conditions, previously determined in exploratory experiments, can still be fitted to a relatively large range of equilibrium constants, K2, for the ternary complex (40 µm to 100 µm). However, despite the rather large uncertainty in K2, the variation in et is only 10% (21 ± 2) over the whole range of K2 values. This degree of accuracy in et should be quite satisfactory for evaluating molecular parameters of the ternary complex from the magnitude of et."
https://openalex.org/W1563158037,"Abstract This paper describes the kinetic properties of three glycosyltransferases found in the synaptosome-rich fraction obtained from embryonic chicken brain: CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:glycoprotein sialyltransferase; UDP-galactose:glycoprotein galactosyltransferase; and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. These enzymes synthesize the terminal trisaccharide, sialyl → galactosyl → N-acetylglucosaminyl, of serum type glycoproteins by stepwise addition of the respective glycose moieties. Three other galactosyltransferase activities were detected in the same fraction. These catalyze transfer of the galactosyl group to the terminal N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues of sialidase-treated mucins, to Tay-Sachs ganglioside, and to xylosylserine. A distinguishing characteristic of all of the particulate enzymes is their absolute requirement for detergent for activity. At early stages of development, UDP-galactose:glycoprotein galactosyltransferase and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase were found in soluble form in the fluid surrounding embryonic chicken brains. The soluble galactosyltransferase was also detected in embryonic and adult chicken serum, amniotic fluid, and vitreous humor, and in human spinal fluid. The possible significance of this enzyme in embryonic brain development is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1536489901,"Abstract An enzyme which methylates the e-amino group of lysine residues in histones was solubilized from calf thymus nuclei. The enzyme was present in nuclei and was found in all the rat organs tested. Although the enzyme was not purified to high extent, practically all of the endogenous methylation activity (enzyme activity without added exogenous histone) was eliminated. The enzyme was most effective toward various histones, and especially arginine-rich histone. Polylysine was methylated to some extent. Zinc ion at a concentration of 2 x 10-3 m abolished the enzyme activity completely, but Mg++ ions were without effect. The Km value of the enzyme for S-adenosyl-l-methionine was 3.0 x 10-6 m. A simple assay method for the enzyme activity was also determined."
https://openalex.org/W1596042978,"Abstract Citrate synthase occurs in two kinetically distinguishable forms, termed C and W in cold and warm acclimated trout, respectively. Oxalacetate and acetyl-CoA saturation curves for both enzymes are hyperbolic and do not show any substrate inhibition. The apparent Km values for the C form increase with temperature above 10°. At saturating (0.1 mm) levels of oxalacetate, the Km of acetyl-CoA is 0.05 mm at 10°, about one-fifth the value at 35°. At saturating levels of acetyl-CoA, the Km of oxalacetate is 7 µm at 10°, about one-fourth the value at 35°. These values at low temperature are similar to the Km constants for the W form below 15°, but above 15°, the Km values for the W form are distinctly lower than for the C form. In the upper biological temperature range for both cold and warm acclimated trout, the Q10 for citrate synthase is about 1.0 at low substrate concentrations because the increase in Km compensates for the increasing thermal energy. At saturating substrate concentrations, the temperature characteristics of the two enzymes are the same, and the calculated activation energies are 8.8 kcal per mole. Both C and W forms of citrate synthase are strongly inhibited by ATP, which increases the Km of acetyl-CoA (5-fold at pH 7.5 and 22°) but does not alter the calculated Vmax. ATP inhibition is noncompetitive with respect to oxalacetate, and the oxalacetate saturation curve remains hyperbolic in the presence of ATP. The Ki of ATP for the C form increases dramatically with temperature above 15°, while the Ki of the W form is thermally insensitive to nearly the lethal limit for trout. The calculated Vmax values for both C and W forms increase 4-fold between pH 6.5 and 8.5, but the Km values are rather insensitive to pH changes. The Ki of ATP, on the other hand, increases 4-fold between pH 6.5 and 8.5. Since the pH in poikilotherms increases at low temperature, these effects of pH on citrate synthase may (a) reduce the Q10 of the reaction irrespective of substrate concentrations, and (b) reduce thermal effects on ATP inhibition."

The studies demonstrate how the regular surface architecture of the organ of Corti is altered after exposure to noise. The changes include loss of sensory hairs, formation of giant hairs, and complete degeneration of circumscribed areas of the organ of Corti. Our method greatly reduces the artifacts."

https://openalex.org/W1484225199,"Abstract The erythrocytes of the polychaete annelid Glycera dibranchiata contain two hemoglobins that are separable by gel filtration or electrophoresis. Gel filtration and ultracentrifugation studies of the smaller of the two hemoglobins show that it possesses a molecular weight of 17,000 to 18,000 at neutral pH; its iron content is 0.318 ± 0.015 weight per cent. The other hemoglobin has a molecular weight of about 39,000 at pH 7.4 to 8.5, and an iron content of 0.293 ± 0.010 weight per cent. Disc electrophoresis of the two hemoglobins at pH = 7.4 in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate produces a single band corresponding to a molecular weight of 17,000 + 1,000. The amino acid compositions of the two hemoglobins are found to be different. In the presence of urea concentrations greater than 4 m, i.e. under conditions where the s20,w values for both hemoglobins are equal, disc electrophoresis at pH 8.25 reveals that both are polymorphic."
https://openalex.org/W1551072800,"Abstract Antibodies were used to isolate three glycolytic enzymes from rat liver after single injections of 3H-leucine. From the rates of decay of specific radioactivity, the following apparent half-lives were determined: lactic dehydrogenase, 6.0 days; aldolase, 4.9 days; and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5.4 days. Corrections for reutilization of isotope based on the relative turnover rates of total liver protein determined with 3H-leucine and with 14C-guanido arginine reduced these figures by 42%. The turnover rates show no correlation with the thermal stabilities of the enzymes at physiological temperatures because the thermal half-lives for aldolase and lactic dehydrogenase were estimated to be 130 days and 12,000 days at 37°. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that turnover involves a random enzymatic attack of cellular proteins, possibly following engulfment by lysosomes. The concentration of aldolase in rat liver is nearly 10 times that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Our results indicate that this is due to a more rapid synthesis, rather than a slower rate of degradation of the former enzyme compared to the latter."

https://openalex.org/W1603892170,The enzymatic decarboxylation of uracil 5-carboxylic acid has been demonstrated. A partially purified enzyme preparation has been obtained from Neurospora crassa which stoichiometrically converts uracil 5-carboxylic acid to uracil and carbon dioxide. No cofactor requirement for uracil 5-carboxylic acid decarboxylase activity was detected.
https://openalex.org/W1508691785,"Abstract Insulin and prolactin stimulate the rate of incorporation of 3H-uridine into rapidly labeled nuclear RNA in mammary epithelial cells in organ culture. Since these hormones do not significantly alter the pool size and specific activity of uridine triphosphate, these effects appear to represent increased rates of RNA synthesis. These RNAs consist of 45 S and 32 S preribosomal RNA and heterogeneous, short lived RNA whose base composition is DNA-like. The hormonal stimulations result in an effective increase in the preribosomal RNA processed into 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA. The magnitude of prolactin's stimulation of RNA labeling is greater upon the ribosomal RNA than upon the preribosomal RNA, which suggests that prolactin may stimulate the ribosomal RNA-processing reactions. RNA synthesis was stimulated by prolactin only in daughter epithelial cells formed in vitro and previously treated with hydrocortisone, and this action of prolactin required the synergistic action of insulin. The stimulatory effect of prolactin on the synthesis of nuclear RNA was observed within 30 min, preceding the previously demonstrated increase in cytoplasmic ribosome concentration and the induction of specific milk proteins, and appears to represent an early effect of this hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1679704794,"Cell-free extracts of Neurospora crassa catalyze the methylation of the α-amino nitrogen atom of histidine, α-N-methylhistidine, and α-N,N-dimethylhistidine to form hercynine (α-N,N,N-trimethylhistidine). S-Adenosylmethionine serves as the common methyl group donor. The enzyme system responsible for these methylations has been purified 500-fold by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The most highly purified preparation showed a single major component during acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractionation studies, kinetic studies, inhibition studies, and heat-inactivation studies all indicate that a single enzyme (histidine-α-N-methyltransferase) is responsible for the three transmethylation reactions involved in the conversion of histidine to hercynine."
https://openalex.org/W1489516878,"The reconstitution of ferredoxin from apoferredoxinred was carried out in the presence of limiting amounts of iron or sulfide. No iron-poor or sulfide-poor ferredoxins containing less than 8 eq of both iron and sulfide could be recovered. Thus the reconstitution appears to be an phenomenon. Treatment of chemically reduced ferredoxin from Clostridium acidi-urici with a slight excess of α,α'-bipyridyl resulted in the removal of 25% of both iron and sulfide. The loss of iron was accompanied by a comparable reduction in both the specific biological activity and absorbance at 390 mµ. After fractionation of the reaction products with ammonium sulfate, 54% of the material contained a full complement of iron and sulfide. Similarly, oxidized ferredoxin, when treated with a limiting amount of α,α'-bipyridyl for 22 hours at room temperature, lost 47% of both its iron and activity in an enzymic assay. Of the starting material, 46% contained a full complement of iron and sulfide. No ferredoxin containing less than a full complement of iron and sulfide could be isolated. These results demonstrate that α,α'-bipyridyl also reacts with ferredoxin in an all-or-none manner. In the reaction with limiting amounts of sodium mersalyl, ferredoxin lost 56% of its sulfide and 50% of its biological activity in an enzymic assay. Of the starting material, 38% was recovered with a full complement of iron and sulfide. The reaction with mersalyl is also an all-or-none phenomenon. Conditions optimal for reconstitution of ferredoxin from apoferredoxin are described."

https://openalex.org/W1522154441,"Abstract Parallel experiments have demonstrated that purified α-urease, defined by its electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gels, is the molecular species with an s20,w of 18.3 S. Gel filtration of α-urease to remove mercaptoethanol was followed by the appearance of a series of urease polymers, which were studied by ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis. The sedimentation coefficients 18.3, 27.6, 33.8, 39.8, and 44.4 S agreed with electrophoretic mobilities in indicating an integral arithmetic polymer series, with molecular weights 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 million. All members were enzymatically active by catalytic gel staining; densitometry indicated a polymer distribution quite similar to that determined from relative schlieren peak areas, suggesting approximately the same specific activity for each polymer. The sedimentation constants were analyzed by means of the Kirkwood equation, manipulated so as to permit calculation of center to center distances between the monomeric units of each polymer. Close agreement was obtained for a model in which α-urease is spherical with a diameter of 125 A, the deviation of its frictional ratio from unity being due primarily to hydration, and polymerization occurs as rigid straight chain assemblies. Polymer linearity is a tentative conclusion, since concentration dependence has not been excluded except in the case of the 18.3 S polymerizing unit, where it was found to be negligible at concentrations of 6 mg per ml and below. Sedimentation ratios predicted by the Kirkwood equation for linear and compact polymers are presented, as well as formulations suitable for estimating center to center distances and geometric arrangements of any monomer-dimer-trimer series."

https://openalex.org/W1996760993,"THE red cell antigen Gerbich (Gea), thought to be among the most widely distributed of blood group antigens, was first noted in 1960 when three women who lacked the antigen made anti-Gea in response to pregnancy1. Subsequently a further fourteen Ge(a−) subjects were discovered through the presence of anti-Gea in their serum, the antibody selecting them out of perhaps millions. The seventeen propositi were from ten different countries and were of European, Mexican, South American Indian and Negro extraction. Some of the sibs of these propositi were also Ge(a−), but outside their families no Ge(a−) subject was found in testing nearly 40,000 random people, chiefly Europeans but including more than 1,000 Negroes and more than 100 Asiatics1,2. The antigen was shown to be a dominant character and its locus to be genetically independent of those responsible for most of the established blood group systems2."

https://openalex.org/W2005675322,IT has been generally thought that nucleic acids are unable to elicit an immune response without carrier protein and adjuvant1. We have recently succeeded in accelerating the spontaneous formation of antibodies to RNA and DNA in New Zealand mice with polyinosinic · polycytidylic acid (poly I·C) without carrier protein or additional adjuvant2. We have also made New Zealand mice immunologically tolerant to subsequent challenge with poly I·C in complete Freund's adjuvant by pretreatment with poly I·C followed by Cyclophosphamide3. These studies in mice that spontaneously develop antibodies to nucleic acids suggested that poly I·C was immunogenic but did not prove that nucleic acids could be recognized immunologically by normal mice. We now report the induction of immunological tolerance to poly I·C in normal strains of mice as a method of demonstrating immunological recognition of this nucleic acid.

The first step in this degradative pathway is the derivatization of cyclopropanecarboxylate to a compound that contains the intact cyclopropylcarbonyl moiety. This paper demonstrates that the most probable second step in this pathway is the opening of the cyclopropane ring by the direct addition of water across one of its carbon to carbon single bonds.
