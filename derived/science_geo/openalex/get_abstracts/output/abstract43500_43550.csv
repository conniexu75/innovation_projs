https://openalex.org/W1480115800,"Complementary DNA clones encoding a glucose transporter-like protein have been isolated from a human fetal skeletal muscle cDNA library. The 496-amino acid fetal muscle glucose transporter-like protein has 64.4 and 51.6% identity with the previously described human erythrocyte/HepG2 and liver glucose transporter sequences, respectively. RNA blotting studies indicate that transcripts encoding this glucose transporter-like protein are present in most tissues, although their relative abundance varies. The gene encoding this protein has been localized to human chromosome 12p13.3. The identification and characterization of a third human glucose transporter-related protein suggests that there is a family of proteins having similar sequences and structures which are involved in nutrient transport by mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1990154423,"A naturally occurring (dT-dC)18:(dA-dG)18 repeat in the H conformation of DNA was shown to contain single-stranded nucleotides in the center of the TC18 repeat and on one half of the AG18 repeat. These results support the model that H-DNA is a structure containing both triple-stranded and single-stranded regions. The stability of this structure was affected by both pH and the degree of negative supercoiling: at pH 7.6 to 7.7, a high level of supercoiling was needed to keep about half of the molecules in the H conformation; at pH 6 and pH 5, normal levels of supercoiling supported H-DNA; and at pH 4, no supercoiling was required. At mildly alkaline pH, the TC/AG18 repeat assumed a novel conformation called J-DNA that differed from both the B and H forms. A three-dimensional model for the structure of H-DNA is proposed that accounts both for the single-strandedness of the nucleotides and for the influence of supercoiling on H-DNA formation. This model predicts and evidence is presented that H-DNA introduces a sharp kink in the DNA. Moreover, the angle of this kink appears not to be fixed, so that H-DNA is also a hinged-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1550909330,"Thioredoxin is the best representative enzyme of a group of proteins, widely distributed and possessing dithiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity. We have constructed a cDNA library from messenger RNAs isolated from a lymphoblastoid B cell line (Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized normal human lymphocytes). Screening of this library with synthetic oligonucleotide probes, constructed from the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of a protein produced by this line, allowed us to identify a full-length cDNA clone coding for human thioredoxin. The open reading frame (315 nucleotides long) codes for a protein of 104 amino acids (excluding the initial methionine). This protein possesses the highly conserved enzymatic active site common to plant and bacterial thioredoxins: Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (amino acids 30-34). These data provide for the first time the complete primary sequence of a thioredoxin of mammalian origin. Recombinant human thioredoxin, expressed in Escherichia coli, possesses a dithiol-reducing enzymatic activity as assayed on mammalian and plant substrates. It is able to reduce the interchain disulfide bridges of murine pentameric IgM and porcin insulin and also to activate vegetal NADP-malate dehydrogenase. Studies of human thioredoxin mRNA expression and regulation in immunocompetent cells of human origin indicate that the protein is weakly expressed in resting lymphocytes and monocytes, but the level of human thioredoxin mRNA transcription is quite important in activated monocytes and established dividing human cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2089157155,Structural information on an atomic scale has been obtained for a Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) trilayer system by means of long-period x-ray standing waves. The LB trilayer of zinc and cadmium arachidate was deposited on a layered synthetic microstructure (LSM) consisting of 200 tungsten/silicon layer pairs with a 25 A period. A 30 A thermally induced inward collapse of the zinc atom layer that was initially located in the LB trilayer at 53 A above the LSM surface has been observed. The mean position and width of the zinc atom layer was determined with a precision of +/- 0.3 A.
https://openalex.org/W1550297117,"Incubation of low density lipoprotein(s) (LDL) with either lipoprotein lipase or hepatic lipase led to modification of the core lipid composition of LDL. Both lipases modified LDL by substantially reducing core triglyceride content without producing marked differences in size, charge, or lipid peroxide content in comparison to native LDL. The triglyceride-depleted forms of LDL that result from treatment with these two enzymes were degraded at approximately twice the rate of native LDL by human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Lipase-modified LDL degradation was inhibited by chloroquine, suggesting lysosomal involvement in LDL cellular processing. The increased degradation by macrophages of the LDL modified by these lipases was accompanied by enhanced cholesterol esterification rates, as well as by an increase in cellular free and esterified cholesterol content. In a patient with hepatic triglyceride lipase deficiency, degradation of the triglyceride-rich LDL by HMDM was approximately half that of normal LDL. Following in vitro incubation of LDL from this patient with either lipoprotein or hepatic lipase, lipoprotein degradation increased to normal. Several lines of evidence indicate that LDL modified by both lipases were taken up by the LDL receptor and not by the scavenger receptor. 1) The degradation of lipase-modified LDL in nonphagocytic cells (human skin fibroblast and arterial smooth muscle cells) as well as in phagocytic cells (HMDM, J-774, HL-60, and U-937 cell lines) could be dissociated from that of acetylated LDL and was always higher than that of native LDL. A similar pattern was found for cellular cholesterol esterification and cholesterol mass. 2) LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts did not degrade lipase-modified LDL. 3) A monoclonal antibody to the LDL receptor inhibited macrophage degradation of the lipase-modified LDL. 4) Excess amounts of unlabeled LDL competed substantially with 125I-labeled lipase-modified LDL for degradation by both macrophages and fibroblasts. Thus, lipase-modified LDL can cause significant cholesterol accumulation in macrophages even though it is taken up by LDL and not by the scavenger receptor. This effect could possibly be related to the reduced triglyceride content in the core of LDL, which may alter presentation of the LDL receptor-binding domain of apolipoprotein B on the particle surface, thereby leading to increased recognition and cellular uptake via the LDL receptor pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1526300496,"D-Glucose deprivation of primary rat brain glial cell cultures, by incubation with 25 mM D-fructose for 24 h, resulted in a 4-5-fold induction of D-glucose transport activity. In contrast, 24-h D-glucose starvation of primary rat brain neuronal cultures had only a marginal effect (1.5-2-fold) on D-glucose transport activity. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA demonstrated that under these conditions the rat brain glial cells specifically increased the steady-state level of the D-glucose transporter mRNA 4-6-fold, whereas Northern blot analysis of the neuronal cell cultures revealed no significant alteration in the amount of D-glucose transporter mRNA by D-glucose deprivation. These findings demonstrated that the D-glucose-dependent regulation of the D-glucose transporter system occurred in a brain cell type-specific manner. The ED50 for the D-glucose starvation increase in the D-glucose transporter mRNA, in the glial cell cultures, occurred at approximately 3.5 mM D-glucose with maximal effect at 0.5 mM D-glucose. Readdition of D-glucose to the starved cell cultures reversed the increase in the D-glucose transporter mRNA levels and D-glucose transport activity to control values within 24 h. The increase in the D-glucose transporter mRNA was relatively rapid with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 2 h and maximal induction by 6-12 h of D-glucose deprivation. A similar time course was also observed for the starvation-induced increase in D-glucose transport activity and D-glucose transporter protein, as determined by Western blot analysis. These results document that, in rat brain glial cells, D-glucose transport activity, protein, and mRNA are regulated by the extracellular D-glucose concentration. Further, this suggests a potential role for hyperglycemia in the down-regulation of the D-glucose transport system in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1601899251,"Fibrinogen, the major structural precursor of blood clots, was deglycosylated by peptide-N-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase without denaturation of the polypeptide chains. Deglycosylated fibrinogen behaved normally in clinical coagulation assays, although it is less soluble than normal fibrinogen. However, the turbidity of clots formed from deglycosylated fibrinogen always rose faster and higher than that of clots from normal fibrinogen. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that fibrin made from clots of deglycosylated fibrinogen consisted of thicker, less-branched fiber bundles in a more porous network. Moreover, the degree of lateral aggregation was directly related to clot turbidity and inversely related to branching. Deglycosylation promoted turbidity development, lateral aggregation, and porosity of clots under all conditions tested. All other steps in the coagulation pathways appeared to be unaffected by the absence of carbohydrate. These results suggest that carbohydrate constitutively affects the behavior of deglycosylated fibrinogens by 1) contributing a repulsive force that promotes fibrinogen solubility and limits fibrin assembly and 2) sensitizing fibrin to conditions that influence assembly and clot structure."
https://openalex.org/W1515941828,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and a receptor-associated protein of 43 kDa are the major proteins present in postsynaptic membranes isolated from Torpedo electric organ. Immunochemical analyses indicated that a protein sharing antigenic determinants with the receptor-associated protein is also present at receptor clusters of muscle cell lines and postsynaptic membranes of vertebrate neuromuscular junctions. We now provide definitive proof that a homolog of the 43-kDa protein exists in mammals. Complimentary DNA clones encoding the complete protein sequence have been isolated from the mouse muscle cell line, BC3H1. We heretofore refer to these proteins as nicotinic receptor-associated proteins at synapses or N-RAP-syns. The deduced sequence of mouse RAPsyn has 412 amino acids and a molecular mass of 46,392 daltons. The overall identity with Torpedo RAPsyn is 70%; some regions are extremely well conserved and are therefore postulated to be functionally important. Important domains, including the amino terminus and a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site, are conserved between species. Several structural features are consistent with the proposal that RAPsyn is a peripheral membrane protein that associates with membranes by virtue of covalently bound myristate. Although multiple mRNAs were previously identified in Torpedo electric organ, RNA blot analysis reveals a single polyadenylated RAPsyn mRNA of approximately equal to 2.0 kilobases in newborn and 4-week-old mouse muscle. Finally, genomic DNA blot analysis indicates that a single N-RAPsyn gene is present in the mouse genome."
https://openalex.org/W1507224284,"The binding site of the guanine moiety of GTP on beta-tubulin was located within the peptide consisting of residues 63-77, AILVDLEPGTMDSVR. The result was obtained using direct photoaffinity labeling, peptide sequencing, and limited proteolysis. Peptides were identified by end-labeling with a monoclonal antibody against beta-tubulin whose epitope was located between 3 and 4 kDa from the C terminus. The sequence of the GTP-binding site is consistent with predictions from other GTP-binding proteins such as elongation factor Tu or ras p21."
https://openalex.org/W1606752183,"A differentiation-associated 93-kDa tyrosine kinase (p93) was purified previously from the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. The present study conclusively identifies p93 as the c-fes proto-oncogene product and shows that expression of p93c-fes and its associated tyrosine kinase activity are marked in mature granulocytes, monocytes, and human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Antisera to peptides obtained by expression of c-fes cDNA fragments in Escherichia coli reacted strongly with p93 purified from HL-60 cells. Western blots using one of these antisera demonstrated high levels of p93c-fes protein in normal human granulocytes and monocytes, as well as the cell lines KG-1, THP-1, HEL, and U-937, all of which can be induced to differentiate along the myelomonocytic pathway. Conversely, in cell lines resistant to myeloid differentiation, p93c-fes expression was either very low or absent. Expression of immunoreactive p93c-fes in these cell lines showed a strong positive correlation with p93c-fes tyrosine kinase activity, which was measured in cell extracts using a nondenaturing gel assay. Finally, the expression of p93c-fes, its tyrosine kinase activity, and the binding of 125I-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were all coordinately increased in HL-60 cells treated with the granulocytic differentiation inducer dimethyl sulfoxide, while all three parameters were low in untreated or differentiation-resistant HL-60 cells. These results suggest that expression of p93c-fes tyrosine kinase activity may be an essential component of myeloid differentiation and responsiveness to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor."
https://openalex.org/W1502454959,"Denaturation of defatted human albumin monomer, monitored by differential scanning calorimetry, is monophasic as reflected by the single, resulting endotherm. With low levels of various ligands, biphasic or monophasic unfolding processes are manifested as bimodal or unimodal thermograms, respectively. The greater the affinity of native protein for ligand, the greater is the tendency for biphasic denaturation. We propose that such a biphasic unfolding process arises from a substantial increase in stability (transition temperature) of remaining native protein during denaturation. This increase in stability derives from the free energy of ligand binding becoming more negative due to the release of high affinity ligand by unfolding protein. The tendency for biphasic denaturation is greatest at low (subsaturating) levels of ligand where greatest increases in stability occur. Biphasic unfolding arising from such ligand redistribution results from denaturation of different kinds of protein molecules, ligand-poor and ligand-rich species, and not from sequential unfolding of domains within the same molecule. Differentiating between these two mechanisms is necessary for the correct interpretation of biphasic denaturation data. Furthermore, biphasic unfolding due to ligand redistribution occurs independently of the means used to effect denaturation. The maximum increase in stability due to ligand binding relative to the stability of defatted albumin monomer alone occurs with the intermediate affinity ligand octanoate (22 degrees C) and not with the high affinity ligand hexadecanoate (15 degrees C). This indicates a much greater affinity of denatured albumin for hexadecanoate since increase in stability derives from the difference between free energy of ligand binding to folded and unfolded protein forms."
https://openalex.org/W1527473850,"cDNAs encoding the precursor of the alpha-subunit of human electron transfer flavoprotein (p alpha-ETF) were cloned and sequenced. The cDNAs span 1,300 base pairs and include the entire coding region of 333 amino acids. The identity of the p alpha-ETF clones was confirmed by hybrid selected translation, by transcription/translation of a cDNA, and by mitochondrial processing of the protein produced by these translations. The identity of the cDNA clones was further confirmed by matching the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs to amino acid sequences determined from seven tryptic peptides prepared from purified rat alpha-subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (alpha-ETF). Ninety-eight of 105 amino acids from these rat alpha-ETF tryptic peptides matched with those deduced from the human cDNAs. The seven amino acid substitutions are presumably due to species difference. The calculated molecular weight of the human alpha-ETF precursor was 35,084. The amino-terminal amino acid of the mature protein could not be determined by amino-terminal sequencing, presumably due to blockage and, therefore, an accurate molecular weight of mature alpha-ETF could not be calculated. The molecular sizes of the precursor and mature alpha-ETF have been estimated to be 35 and 32 kDa, respectively, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1583931582,"A protein from rat kidney was characterized that had several properties common to a multigene family of fatty acid binding proteins identified in other tissues. The putative kidney fatty acid binding protein (FABP) was purified from the soluble fraction of kidney homogenates using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. It was relatively abundant, had an apparent molecular mass of 15.5 kDa as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, bound equimolar amounts of oleic acid, and could be distinguished from other FABPs on the basis of size, amino acid composition, and tissue distribution. Polyclonal antibodies to kidney FABP were obtained and used to show that only kidney contained the 15.5-kDa protein, although the antibodies also recognized a slightly larger and less abundant protein in kidney that also was present in bladder. Rat kidney also contained heart FABP, and the properties of both FABPs in rat kidney were compared. The distribution of both proteins within the kidney differed, with kidney FABP being localized almost exclusively within the cortex, whereas heart FABP was found both in cortex and medulla. Kidney FABP was expressed developmentally after the neonatal period, whereas heart FABP was present in both neonatal and adult kidney at comparable amounts. Hypertension induced by mineralocorticoids or infusion of angiotensin II caused a marked suppression of kidney FABP expression, whereas amounts of heart FABP in kidney were unchanged. The studies showed that rat kidney contains at least two FABPs, and that these proteins are differentially regulated, suggesting that functional differences between the proteins may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1509230959,"The role of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in the binding of chylomicron remnants to liver membranes and in their uptake by hepatocytes was assessed using a monospecific polyclonal antibody to the LDL receptor of the rat liver. The anti-LDL receptor antibody inhibited the binding and uptake of chylomicron remnants and LDL by the poorly differentiated rat hepatoma cell HTC 7288C as completely as did unlabeled lipoproteins. The antireceptor antibody, however, decreased binding of chylomicron remnants to liver membranes from normal rats by only about 10%. This was true for intact membranes and for solubilized reconstituted membranes and with both a crude membrane fraction as well as with purified sinusoidal membranes. Further, complete removal of the LDL receptor from solubilized membranes by immunoprecipitation with antireceptor antibody only decreased remnant binding to the reconstituted supernatant by 10% compared to solubilized, nonimmunoprecipitated membranes. Treatment of rats with ethinyl estradiol induced an increase in remnant binding by liver membranes. All of the increased binding could be inhibited by the antireceptor antibody. The LDL receptor-independent remnant binding site was not EDTA sensitive and was not affected by ethinyl estradiol treatment. LDL receptor-independent remnant binding was competed for by beta-VLDL = HDLc greater than rat LDL greater than human LDL (where VLDL is very low density lipoprotein, and HDL is high density lipoprotein). There was weak and incomplete competition by apoE-free HDL, probably due to removal of apoE from the remnant. The LDL receptor-independent remnant-binding site was also present in membranes prepared from isolated hepatocytes and had the same characteristics as the site on membranes prepared from whole liver. In contrast, when chylomicron remnants were incubated with a primary culture of rat hepatocytes, the anti-LDL receptor antibody prevented specific cell association by 84% and degradation of chylomicron remnants completely. Based on these studies, we conclude that although binding of chylomicron remnants to liver cell membranes is not dependent on the LDL receptor, their intact uptake by hepatocytes is."
https://openalex.org/W1500634993,"The presence of a thiol in the steroid binding cavity of glucocorticoid receptors has recently been proved by our affinity labeling of Cys-656 in the steroid binding domain of rat receptors (Simons, S. S., Jr., Pumphrey, J. G., Rudikoff, S., and Eisen, H. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9676-9680). Studies with the sterically small, thiol-specific reagent methyl methanethiolsulfonate (MMTS) now reveal the involvement of at least two sulfhydryl groups in steroid binding. While the dose-response curves for [3H]dexamethasone binding versus thiol reagent are normally sigmoidal, an unusual bimodal curve is obtained with MMTS in which dexamethasone binding is eliminated at low, but maintained at intermediate, MMTS concentrations. This bimodal dose-response curve demands the involvement of two (or more) thiol groups. Those receptors pretreated with intermediate concentrations of MMTS retain approximately 70% of the initial binding capacity and one-fifth the affinity for dexamethasone. Solutions of this low affinity form of receptor contain essentially no accessible -SH groups, and all of the usual covalent labeling by dexamethasone 21-mesylate of various proteins, including the receptor, is blocked. The facts, that this low affinity form of the receptor is not affected by added iodoacetamide, cannot be produced from the nonsteroid binding form of receptor simply by adding more MMTS, and displays different kinetics of formation than does the nonsteroid binding form of receptor all argue that reaction of the receptor with intermediate and low MMTS, concentrations occurs via different pathways. Nevertheless, the effects of both concentrations of MMTS on the receptor are fully reversible with added dithiothreitol. The kinetics of inhibition of [3H]dexamethasone binding at low MMTS concentrations are independent of receptor concentration, indicating an intramolecular reaction. Collectively these data suggest a model of steroid binding involving two thiols, one of which appears to be Cys-656. Low concentrations of MMTS induce the formation of an intramolecular disulfide, which prevents steroid binding, while the intermediate MMTS concentrations convert both thiols directly to mixed disulfides, and steroid binding persists. Thus, reduced thiols do not appear to be required for steroid binding if the steric bulk of the oxidized thiols is small."
https://openalex.org/W1489868419,"TDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase was purified from Saccharopolyspora erythraea, the producer of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A, by a high resolution chromatographic method that exploited the difference in the behavior of the protein on anionic exchange chromatography in Tris/HCl or phosphate buffers. By this method, the enzyme was purified approximately 900-fold by two anionic exchange steps to more than 90% homogeneity. It was further purified to apparent homogeneity by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The enzyme is a homodimer of Mr 36,000 subunits, is highly specific for TDP-D-glucose, requires NAD+ as cofactor, and shows a K'm of 34 microM and V'max of 26 mumol h-1 mg-1 of protein for TDP-D-glucose. TDP and TTP strongly inhibit the enzyme at 2 mM. The maximal TDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase activity coincides with the time of erythromycin production, suggesting that this enzyme is involved in antibiotic biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1606298544,"It has recently been discovered that several lens proteins in birds and lower vertebrates are active enzymes or enzyme-related proteins (Wistow, G., Mulders, J. W. M., and de Jong, W. W. (1987) Nature 326, 622-624; Wistow, G., and Piatigorsky, J. (1987) Science 236, 1554-1556). We report here a novel lens protein, designated as lambda-crystallin, that occurs in rabbit and hare. It constitutes 7-8% of the total lens protein and has a subunit molecular mass of 35 kDa. Sequencing of cDNA clones encoding rabbit lambda-crystallin revealed 30% homology (at the amino acid sequence level) with L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from pig mitochondria and 26% homology with enoyl-CoA hydratase-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from rat peroxisomes. Also, the presence of a putative beta-alpha-beta nucleotide-binding fold and low levels of non-lens expression are indicative of some enzymatic function for lambda-crystallin (or highly related sequences) in non-lens tissues. lambda-Crystallin thus represents the first example of an enzyme-related crystallin in lenses from mammalian species. The recruitment of enzymes as lens structural proteins apparently is an evolutionary strategy which has been applied independently in different lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1587448063,"The inhibitions of protein synthesis initiation in heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates and in GSSG-treated hemin-supplemented lysates are both characterized by the activation of heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase, which phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF-2). In both inhibitions, the accumulation of eIF phosphorylated in alpha-subunit (eIF-2(alpha P)) leads to the sequestration of reversing factor (RF) in a phosphorylated 15 S complex, RF.eIF-2(alpha P), in which RF is nonfunctional. A sensitive assay for the detection of endogenous RF activity in protein-synthesizing lysates indicates that, in GSSG-inhibited (1 mM GSSG) lysates, RF is more profoundly inhibited than in heme-deficient lysates. RF inactivation in GSSG-induced inhibition appears to be due to two separate but additive effects: (i) the formation of the phosphorylated 15 S RF complex, RF.eIF-2(alpha P), and (ii) the formation of disulfide complexes which inhibit RF activity. Both inhibitory effects are overcome by catalytic levels of exogenous RF which permits the resumption of protein synthesis. RF activity and protein synthesis in GSSG-inhibited lysates are efficiently restored by the delayed addition of glucose-6-P or 2-deoxyglucose-6-P (1 mM). The rescue of protein synthesis by hexose phosphate (1 mM) is proportional to the extent of RF recovery and is due in part to NADPH generation; even at levels of hexose phosphate (50 microM) too low to support protein synthesis, partial restoration of RF activity occurs due to increased NADPH/NADP+ ratios. The ability of dithiothreitol (1 mM) to restore RF activity in GSSG-treated but not heme-deficient lysates also provides evidence for a reducing mechanism which functions at the level of RF. The results suggest that NADPH plays a role in the maintenance of sulfhydryl groups essential for RF activity."
https://openalex.org/W1560413344,"Low pH is believed to play a critical role in the penetration of membranes by diphtheria toxin in vivo. In this report, the pH dependence of the conformation of fragment A of diphtheria toxin has been studied using fluorescence techniques. As pH is decreased, fragment A in solution undergoes a reversible conformational change beginning below pH 5. The conformational change occurs rapidly upon exposure to low pH. It involves both an increase in the exposure of tryptophanyl residues to solution and a switch from a hydrophilic state to a hydrophobic state as judged by fragment A binding to micelles of a mild detergent (Brij 96). At low pH fragment A also rapidly and tightly binds to and penetrates model membranes. Binding is reversed when pH is neutralized. The transition pH, the apparent midpoint of the change between the hydrophilic state and the membrane-penetrating hydrophobic state, occurs at about pH 3.5 in the presence of Brij 96 micelles, pH 4 in the presence of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, and pH 5 in the presence of SUV composed of 25 mol % anionic phosphatidylglycerol and 75% phosphatidylcholine. The effects of high temperature provide an important clue as to the nature of the changes at low pH. At neutral pH and high temperature, i.e. in the thermally denatured state, a conformational change similar to that observed at low pH occurs, although fragment A does not become hydrophobic. In addition, the effects of low pH and high temperature on the stability of the native state are cumulative. This indicates that the changes in fragment A both at high temperature and at low pH involve denaturation, although there appears to be only partial unfolding under these conditions. Based on the results of this study, the role of fragment A in diphtheria toxin membrane penetration and translocation is evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W1591021490,"The earliest events in protein secretion include targeting to and translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To dissect the mechanism by which signal sequences mediate translocation in eukaryotes, we are examining the behavior of fusion proteins and deletion mutants in cell-free systems. We demonstrate that the protein domain being translocated can have profound impact on the efficiency of the translocation process. Specifically, deletions in the mature prolactin passenger domain, beyond the signal cleavage site, reduce the efficiency of signal function. The effect of these deletions on signal function is observed when this signal sequence is in its normal position, at the amino terminus, and when internalized by the addition of 117 amino acids of chimpanzee alpha-globin. Alterations in the interaction of the deletion mutants with the signal recognition particle and with another component of the translocation system, signal peptidase, were observed. Our results suggest that subtle changes in sequences beyond the signal cleavage site can alter the efficiency of co-translational translocation by affecting various signal-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1628126554,"The gene coding for the flavodoxin protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) has been identified, cloned, and sequenced. DNA fragments containing the flavodoxin gene were identified by hybridization of a mixed synthetic heptadecanucleotide probe to Southern blots of SalI-digested genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequences of the probe were derived from the published protein primary structure (Dubourdieu, M., LeGall, J., and Fox, J. L. (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 52, 1418-1425). The same oligonucleotide probe was used to screen libraries (in pUC19) containing size-selected SalI fragments. One recombinant, carrying a 1.6-kilobase (kb) insert which strongly hybridizes to the probe, was found to contain a nucleotide sequence which codes for the first 104 residues of the amino-terminal portion of the flavodoxin protein sequence but lacked the remainder of the gene. Therefore, a PstI restriction fragment from this clone was used as a probe to isolate the entire gene from a partial Sau3AI library in Charon 35. Of the plaques which continued to hybridize strongly to this probe through repeated screenings, one recombinant, containing a 16-kb insert, was further characterized. The entire flavodoxin gene was localized within a 1.4-kb XhoI-SacI fragment of this clone. The complete nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for the flavodoxin protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris and flanking sequences which may include promoter and regulatory sequences are reported here. The cloned flavodoxin gene was placed behind the hybrid tac promoter for overexpression of the protein in Escherichia coli. Modification to the 5'-end of the gene, including substitutions at the second codon, were required to obtain high levels of expression. The expressed recombinant flavodoxin protein is isolated from E. coli cells as the holoprotein with physical and spectral properties similar to the protein isolated from D. vulgaris. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the expression of a foreign flavodoxin gene in E. coli using recombinant DNA methods."

The O-methyltransferase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by a conventional chromatographic procedure. The purified enzyme appears to be trimeric with a molecular weight of 122,000-126,000 and a subunit size of 42,000. Its isoelectric point was 6.0. The enzyme required Mg2+ for maximal activity and was catalytically optimal at pH 7.8-8.5 and 42 degrees C. The O-methyltransferase catalyzed conversion of demethylmacrocin to macrocin at a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1. The O-methyltransferase also mediated conversion of demethyllactenocin----lactenocin. The corresponding Vmax/Km ratios for the two analogous conversions varied only slightly. Both enzymic conversions were susceptible to an extensive and identical range of metabolic inhibitions. Steady-state kinetic studies for initial velocity, substrate analogue, and product inhibitions are consistent with Ordered Bi Bi as the reaction mechanism of demethylmacrocin O-methyltransferase. Except for an identical kinetic mechanism, demethylmacrocin O-methyltransferase can be readily differentiated from macrocin O-methyltransferase by its physical and catalytic properties as well as metabolic inhibitions."

The corresponding Vmax/Km ratios for the two analogous conversions were similar, and both enzymic conversions were susceptible to extensive competitive and noncompetitive inhibitions by macrolide metabolites. Steady-state kinetic studies for initial velocity, substrate analogue, and product inhibitions have allowed formulation of Ordered Bi Bi as the reaction mechanism for macrocin O-methyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1517772102,"Three major 32P-labeled polypeptides were found in the soluble fraction of bovine lenses cultured in a medium containing [32P]orthophosphate. Two of the polypeptides corresponded to the phosphorylated A and B chains of alpha-crystallin. In this communication, the third polypeptide is now identified. This polypeptide is characterized by a molecular weight of 27,000 and a pI of 6.6, eluted exclusively in the beta Low fraction of a CL-6B gel filtration separation of lens soluble material, and could be further purified by DE52 anion exchange chromatography. The only 32P-labeled amino acid detected was phosphoserine. A single 32P-labeled peptide was observed after tryptic digestion and two-dimensional mapping. The amino acid sequence of the purified peptide is Gly-Ala-Phe-His-Pro-Ser-Ser. This sequence exactly matches the expected C-terminal tryptic fragment, residues 198-204, of the bovine beta-crystallin B2. The results of carboxypeptidase A digestion of the 32P-labeled peptide suggest that only Ser203 is phosphorylated. By using the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, purified beta B2 was phosphorylated in vitro, generating a single 32P-labeled polypeptide with the identical pI as the phosphorylated polypeptide obtained from lens culture. On the basis of these data, the Mr 27,000 32P-labeled polypeptide is identified as the phosphorylated form of the beta-crystallin B2."
https://openalex.org/W1534641213,"A genomic DNA fragment (gCORE-1), encoding a portion of the cartilage proteoglycan core protein, has been isolated from a phage library using cDNA as a probe. The genomic insert is about 17 kilobase pairs; two BamHI fragments of the insert (1.3 and 4.8 kilobase pairs) contain most of the hybridizable sequences found in the cDNA. Sequence analysis of these fragments shows that they contain a total of five exons that encompass 216 amino acid residues, all of which are identical to those of the corresponding cDNA sequence. Three of the exons, which are adjacent to one another, are very similar to the corresponding exons in the gene of a rat hepatic lectin as well as to an exon in the gene of human pulmonary surfactant-associated protein. There is a strong degree of conservation of amino acid sequences encoded in the three genes, although there is no similarity between their introns. The sizes of the five exons in gCORE-1, except for one (which is indeterminate because only a partial cDNA sequence is available), are less than 184 base pairs, whereas the sizes of the introns range from 218 to greater than 2629 base pairs. Four of the introns interrupt an exon codon at either their donor or acceptor sites, between the first and second nucleotides. Only one intron does not split a codon. Intron and exon boundary sites are in agreement with known consensus sequences for introns. The dispersed distribution and relatively small size of the exons, if representative of the entire gene, suggest that the complete gene which codes for the core protein may be quite sizable."
https://openalex.org/W1536219094,"Interstitial retinol-binding protein (IRBP) is a glycoprotein that shuttles retinoids between the retina and pigment epithelium and is secreted by the photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate eye. Human retina cDNA libraries in lambda gt10 were screened with a previously isolated human IRBP probe (H.4 IRBP), yielding five overlapping cDNA clones generating a 4223-base sequence. A 17-kilobase pair clone (HGL.3) isolated by screening a human genomic library in EMBL3 with H.4 IRBP yielded a 2.5-kilobase pair SstI fragment that overlapped the 5' end of the cDNA sequence by 329 nucleotide residues. An open reading frame encoded the N-terminal sequence of human IRBP and predicted a protein consisting of 1262 amino acids with a molecular mass of 136,600. Two putative N-linked glycosylation sites were identified. The translated sequence suggests that there is a 16-amino acid presumptive signal peptide rich in hydrophobic residues and with a high alpha-helix probability preceding the N terminus of the mature protein. The amino acid sequence of human IRBP could be aligned with 87% identity with the amino acid sequences of 31 peptides (605 residues) purified from a tryptic digest of bovine IRBP. The protein sequence of human IRBP contains four duplicated segments (302-310 residues in length) with 33-38% identity. From the degree of identity between the bovine and human sequences, it is possible that IRBP evolved by several gene duplications that occurred 600-800 million years ago, before the emergence of the vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1483442578,"The ganglioside composition of the epithelial cells of the small intestine was investigated in 15 strains of inbred rats. Most of these strains had GM3 as the only detectable ganglioside. In addition to GM3, small amounts of GD3 were found in four strains, AVN, BN, DA, and LE. The fatty acid content of the ceramide portion was composed of a large, although variable, percentage of 2-hydroxy fatty acids. The sphingoid base was always C18-4D-hydroxysphinganine. The highly prominent sialic acid was N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) in most strains. However in two strains, Brown Norway (BN) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), NeuAc was the only sialic acid of the gangliosides of the intestinal epithelium. The analysis of the ganglioside composition of the epithelium of the small intestine of the first generation hybrids of SHR with DA and BN, respectively, demonstrated that the expressions of GM3 (NeuGc) and GD3 were genetically transmitted as dominant traits and that BN and SHR were likely to carry the same deficient gene that led to the expression of GM3(NeuAc) instead of GM3(NeuGc) in the small intestine. For comparison, the sialic acid composition of kidney gangliosides was analyzed in some strains. 21-23% of the kidney gangliosides was GM3(NeuGc) in all tested strains, including BN and SHR. Therefore, the ganglioside composition of the intestinal epithelium could vary in the rat species, and the defect of N-glycolylneuraminic acid was not only strain-specific but also occurred in a tissue-specific way among strains of inbred rats."
https://openalex.org/W1588960470,"Muscles of invertebrate species contain abundant quantities of soluble, sarcoplasmic, high affinity Ca2+-binding proteins (SCBPs). The SCBPs belong to the calmodulin superfamily and contain four homologous domains (I-IV) which arose by reduplication of a gene for a small ancestral protein. We have determined the amino acid sequence of the SCBP from the sandworm Nereis diversicolor. This protein is the only SCBP which has been crystallized in a form suitable for three-dimensional structure determination by high-resolution x-ray analysis (Babu, Y. S., Cox, J. A., and Cook, W. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 11184-11185). N. diversicolor SCBP is a single polypeptide chain of 174 amino acids, including single residues of glutamine and histidine, 2 tyrosines, and 3 tryptophans. It is devoid of cysteine and has an acetylated amino terminus, a calculated Mr of 19,485, and a net charge of -13 at neutral pH. There was no evidence for heterogeneity in the sequence. Probable Ca2+-binding sites were recognized in domains I, III, and IV. Comparison with other available invertebrate SCBP sequences shows an unusually high degree of variability among these proteins, with only 9 residues common to all species."
https://openalex.org/W1521953877,"We have investigated the binding of nuclear proteins from the embryonic chicken lens to synthetic oligonucleotides derived from sequence -111/-55 of the murine alpha A-crystallin gene. These sequences were shown previously to consist of a distal (-111/-88) and a proximal (-88/-60) region which are required for expression of this gene (Chepelinsky, A. B., Sommer, B., and Piatigorsky, J. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 1807-1814). Here we use gel retardation and methylation interference experiments to provide evidence for selective binding of different nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides containing sequences -111/-84, -83/-55, and -111/-55. Similar (although not necessarily identical) proteins were found in nuclear extracts of chicken erythrocytes and HeLa cells. Despite this fact, the alpha A-crystallin promoter (-111/+46) did not function in transfected HeLa cells; moreover, deletion experiments showed that only the TATA box is required for activity of this promoter in a HeLa whole cell extract, the distal (-111/84) and proximal (-83/-55) elements having no positive effect on transcription in the HeLa cell extract. These experiments support the idea that the same or related nuclear proteins found in many tissues are necessary but not sufficient for expression of the murine alpha A-crystallin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1547074795,"We previously identified a defect in the in vivo catabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) from hypercholesterolemic pigs carrying a mutant apolipoprotein B allele. In the present studies, we examined the in vitro metabolism of mutant LDL in cultured pig fibroblasts. A 3-fold higher concentration of mutant LDL (compared to control) was needed to displace 50% of control 125I-LDL binding. Mutant LDL had a 6-fold higher dissociation constant than control LDL. Scatchard plots of the binding data were concave upward, suggesting multiple classes of binding sites or negative cooperativity. The mutant LDL degradation rate was reduced by 40%; this decrease could be attributed to a dense LDL subspecies. Mutant and control buoyant LDL subspecies were degraded more slowly than the corresponding dense LDL subspecies. Together, these studies show that diminished LDL receptor binding can result from mutations in apolipoprotein B and from changes in the lipid composition of LDL particles."
https://openalex.org/W1559059557,"Oligosaccharyltransferase solubilized by Nonidet P-40 was found to have a highly specific lipid requirement which is consistent with the lability of the enzyme when removed from its membrane association. Enzyme activity as measured by the N-glycosylation of a hexapeptide acceptor was greatly stimulated and stabilized by phosphatidylcholine (PC) while other naturally occurring phosphoglycerides had minimal effect. The quaternary ammonium group of PC was observed to be involved in the interaction with the enzyme as modification of the choline moiety by removal of methyl groups resulted in a progressive loss of the stimulatory effect (choline greater than N,N-dimethylethanolamine greater than N-monomethylethanolamine greater than ethanolamine) which was reflected primarily in the Vmax rather than the Km values. Evaluation of a number of PC and choline derivatives indicated that the nonpolar domain of the lipid also played an important specifying role. Two hydrophobic chains attached to the phosphoglycerol backbone were found to be essential, and furthermore the length and degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid substituents as well as their position of attachment on the glycerol moiety greatly affected the extent of activation. Since the L-isomer of PC brought about a 3-fold greater stimulation than the D-isomer the interaction of the enzyme with the phospholipid appears to be stereoselective. Upon chromatography of the PC-stabilized enzyme on concanavalin A-agarose almost complete retention occurred at 0.4% Nonidet P-40, while no binding took place at a detergent concentration of 0.075%; this suggested that upon dilution in the presence of PC, the oligosaccharyltransferase was reconstituted into vesicles in an asymmetric fashion with its N-linked carbohydrate located internally. Enzymatic assay of these vesicles demonstrated that the active site of the enzyme was also oriented toward the interior. These studies indicate that the activity as well as the membrane insertion of the oligosaccharyltransferase are to a large measure influenced by its interaction with PC."
https://openalex.org/W1494902279,"Chicken erythrocyte nuclei previously incubated separately with two novel mercury compounds (N-chloromercuribenzoyl)-biocytin and bis(p-(chloromercuribenzoyl))-[3H]lysine diamide) were digested with micrococcal nuclease and the digest products fractionated according to their solubility in 0.15 M NaCl and molecular size. The identity and quantitation of the chromatin fractions and proteins containing covalently bound mercury were determined by Western blotting, autoradiography, and scintillation counting. The most highly acetylated species of histone H3 in the 0.15 M NaCl-soluble polynucleosome fraction also contained the highest proportion of bound mercury. This fraction contains hyperacetylated core histones, is depleted in linker histones, and enriched in nonhistone proteins. Histone H3 in the 0.15 M NaCl-soluble mononucleosomes, which are unacetylated and lack linker histones, was 45% less labeled than histone H3 in the 0.15 M NaCl-soluble polynucleosome fraction. In the 0.15 M NaCl-insoluble polynucleosomes, which contain unacetylated histones and molar proportions of linker histones, histone H3 was 63% less labeled. Allowing for the differential abundance of these subfractions in the nucleus, the relative H3 reactivities are 50, 7, and 1 for 0.15 M NaCl-soluble polynucleosomes, mononucleosomes, and 0.15 M NaCl-insoluble polynucleosomes, respectively. Thus a gradation of reactivities exists which correlates with increasing hyperacetylation and linker histone depletion. High mobility group proteins 1 and 2, found in subnucleosome particles in the 0.15 M NaCl-soluble fraction, are extensively mercury-labeled. Distribution of histone acetyltransferase activity among salt- and size-resolved micrococcal nuclease produced fractions was almost 5-fold greater in the 0.15 M NaCl-soluble supernatant than in the 0.15 M NaCl-insoluble pellet. Furthermore, the acetyltransferase activity, which is tightly bound to undigested chromatin, is rapidly released by both micrococcal nuclease and DNase I. For short digestion times the enzyme is associated with the salt-soluble polynucleosomes, but at longer times of digestion the enzyme appears to be free from intact nucleosomes. The enzyme may be localized in the globin domain in erythrocytes and maintains that region in a hyperacetylated state which results in an altered linker histone binding reflected in a change in the reactivity of the usually inaccessible H3 cysteine 110."

In the presence of heparin and endothelial cell growth factor, subcultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells produced u-PA proteins consisting of about 85-90% Mr 54,000 scu-PA and 10-15% two-chain Mr 54,000. The major scu-PA form was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Sephadex C-50, immunoadsorption on purified anti-u-PA IgG-Sepharose and affinity chromatography on p-amino-benzamidine-Agarose. Typically, about 8-10 micrograms of purified scu-PA protein (antigen/protein ratio = 1) was isolated from 3-liter batches of heparin-containing serum-free conditioned media with a yield of about 41% of the total starting u-PA antigen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this purified u-PA protein showed a single Ag-stained band (nonreduced and reduced), with an estimated molecular weight of about 54,000, which exhibited very low fibrinolytic activity. Purified HUVEC-derived scu-PA did not incorporate 3H-labeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate. This protein did, however, exhibit very low amidolytic activity (approximately 5,000 IU/mg) on the u-PA-specific synthetic substrate pyroglu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide, very low plasminogen-dependent fibrinolytic activity on 125I-labeled fibrin coated plates, and directly activated 125I-labeled plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with high affinity, Km = 0.72 microM and low turnover number, kcat = 0.0005 s-1. Treatment with plasmin rapidly converted the HUVEC-derived scu-PA to the active two-chain Mr 54,000 u-PA form (approximately 90,000 IU/mg). Binding to fibrin clots, using antigen quantitation, indicated about 20, 10, and 90% binding for equimolar amounts of HUVEC-derived scu-PA, two-chain u-PA, and tissue plasminogen activator standards, respectively. These results indicate that subcultured HUVECs synthesize and secrete their u-PA protein as a single-chain molecule with low intrinsic amidolytic and fibrinolytic activity, high affinity for plasminogen and no specific affinity for fibrin. The role of scu-PA in endothelial cell-mediated vascular function has yet to be clearly defined."

Californium desorption-mass spectrometry has been successfully applied to the holistic glycopeptidolipid antigen of M. avium serovar 12 and its per-O-acetyl derivative, to arrive at the following structure, of molecular mass 1876: (Sequence: see text). The pentasaccharide hapten, released as the tetraglycosyl alditol, was subjected to methylation analysis, absolute configurational analysis, 1H NMR and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry to arrive at the structure: 4-(2'-Hydroxy) propionamido-4,6-dideoxy-3-O-Me-Glcp (beta 1----3)-4-O-Me-L-Rhap (alpha 1----3)-L-Rhap (alpha 1----3)-L-Rhap (alpha 1----2)-6-deoxytalitol. Two-dimensional proton correlation spectroscopy was also applied to determine the configuration of the unique distal segment of the oligosaccharide unit. The significance of this structure in the context of the fully elucidated structures of the antigens from 12 of the 31-member M. avium complex is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559601618,"The conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-endo-fenchol is considered to proceed by the initial isomerization of the substrate to (-)-(3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate and the subsequent cyclization of this bound intermediate. Incubation of (1R)-[2-14C,1-3H]- and (1S)-[2-14C,1-3H]geranyl pyrophosphate with a preparation of (-)-endo-fenchol cyclase (synthase) from common fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) gave labeled product of unchanged 3H:14C ratio in both cases, and each was dehydrated to a mixture of alpha- and beta-fenchene which were oxidized to the corresponding alpha- and beta-fenchocamphorones, again without change in isotope ratio. The location of the tritium label was deduced in each case by stereoselective, base-catalyzed exchange of the exo-alpha-hydrogen of the derived ketone. The findings indicated that the configuration at C1 of the substrate was retained in the enzymatic transformation to (-)-endo-fenchol which is entirely consistent with the syn-isomerization of geranyl pyrophosphate to (3R)-linalyl pyrophosphate and cyclization of the latter via the anti-endo-conformer. These absolute stereochemical elements of the reaction sequence were confirmed by the enzymatic conversion of (3R)-1Z-[1-3H]linalyl pyrophosphate to (-)-endo-fenchol and by the location of the tritium in the derived fenchocamphorones as before. The summation of the results fully defines the overall stereochemistry of the coupled isomerization and cyclization of geranyl pyrophosphate to (-)-endo-fenchol."
https://openalex.org/W1603606626,"Difference spectroscopic investigations on the interaction of brain hexokinase with glucose and glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) show that the binary complexes E-glucose and E-Glc-6-P give very similar UV difference spectra. However, the spectrum of the ternary E-glucose-Glc-6-P complex differs markedly from the spectra of the binary complexes, but resembles that produced by the E-glucose-Pi complex. Direct binding studies of the interaction of Glc-6-P with brain hexokinase detect only a single high-affinity binding site for Glc-6-P (KD = 2.8 microM). In the ternary E-glucose-Glc-6-P complex, Glc-6-P has a much higher affinity for the enzyme (KD = 0.9 microM) and a single binding site. Ribose 5-phosphate displaces Glc-6-P from E-glucose-Glc-6-P only, but not from E-Glc-6-P complex. It also fails to displace glucose from E-glucose and E-glucose-Glc-6-P complexes. Scatchard plots of the binding of glucose to brain hexokinase reveal only a single binding site but show distinct evidence of positive cooperativity, which is abolished by Glc-6-P and Pi. These ligands, as well as ribose 5-phosphate, substantially increase the binding affinity of glucose for the enzyme. The spectral evidence, as well as the interactive nature of the sites binding glucose and phosphate-bearing ligands, lead us to conclude that an allosteric site for Glc-6-P of physiological relevance occurs on the enzyme only in the presence of glucose, as a common locus where Glc-6-P, Pi, and ribose 5-phosphate bind. In the absence of glucose, Glc-6-P binds to the enzyme at its active site with high affinity. We also discuss the possibility that, in the absence of glucose, Glc-6-P may still bind to the allosteric site, but with very low affinity, as has been observed in studies on the reverse hexokinase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1485652636,"In the present study, the interaction of alpha-actinin and calmodulin with clathrin heavy chain are demonstrated using Western blot analysis and rotary shadowing electron microscopy. The results show that alpha-actinin and calmodulin bind the clathrin heavy chain. The interaction is specific and affected by calcium. However, the interaction of both proteins with the clathrin heavy chain is distinct; the proteins do not block each other's ability to bind, and they interact with different protein fragments of the clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, using rotary shadowing the results show that alpha-actinin differentially affected the terminal region of the clathrin trimer. Whereas, the effects of calmodulin were most noticeably detected along the length of trimer arms. The possible existence of distinct binding sites on the arms of the clathrin trimer for these cytosolic proteins supports the contention that these cytosolic proteins play an important role in cellular trafficking."

A and T nucleotides are in nearest-neighbor positions in the series poly[d[TA(CG)2-7]], but are isolated from each other, with minimum separations of 2 and 6 GC base pairs, in poly[d[TGCA(CG)6]] and poly[T(GC)3A(CG)4)]], respectively. All of the polymers except poly[d[TA(CG)2]] were shown by circular dichroism to undergo a right- to left-hand helical transition at high NaCl concentrations, and all polymers exhibited a B to A transition in the presence of ethanol. Poly[d[TA(CG)7]] was the only polymer to undergo a B to Z to A transition in ethanol. At a constant percentage of AT base pairs, the B-Z transition is sequence-dependent, occurring at lower salt concentrations for polymers containing longer runs of contiguous GC base pairs in the repeating unit."

https://openalex.org/W1610307822,"The interaction of bovine liver rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) with the acceptor substrates, dithiothreitol or cyanide, was studied. When incubated in the presence of cyanide or dithiothreitol, rhodanese was inactivated in a time-dependent process. This inactivation was detectable only at low enzyme concentrations; the rate and degree of inactivation could be modulated by varying the substrate concentration or the system pH. Activity measurements and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques were used in examining the inactivation phenomenon. Sulfur transfer to dithiothreitol was measured by direct assay and was shown to involve the dequenching of enzymic intrinsic fluorescence that had been previously observed only with cyanide as the acceptor substrate. Substrate-potentiated inactivation of rhodanese (with cyanide) has been reported before, but the cause and nature of this interaction were unexplained. The results presented here are consistent with an explanation invoking oxidation of rhodanese in the course of inactivation."

The native molecular weight determined by gel filtration was 110,000, suggesting a quaternary structure of an alpha 2 type for native TyrRS.

https://openalex.org/W1506302512,"The large tumor antigen (T-ag) of SV40 is a virus-encoded polypeptide that provides multiple biological activities required for virus replication and cellular transformation. T-ag is an exceptional model for the study of protein processing, because it displays a variety of chemical modifications and an unusual dual subcellular distribution. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and processing of T-ag are unknown. With respect to glycosylation, this has been related to a lack of knowledge of the biochemical properties of T-ag as a glycoprotein. Several such properties are characterized here. We found that T-ag is glycosylated at multiple sites on the polypeptide chain. The oligosaccharides appear to belong to a single size class, molecular weight approximately 400, and the linkage between the polypeptide and the carbohydrate side chain is sensitive to beta-elimination under mild alkaline conditions. At least one glycosylation site was localized to the region between amino acids 1 and 272 (probably between residues 83 and 272), and at least one additional site was localized to a separate region, between amino acids 523 and 708. The results of cycloheximide experiments suggested that glycosylation of T-ag is a cotranslational event, and both the nuclear and the membrane-associated forms of T-ag appeared to be glycosylated. The results of these studies verify previous conclusions that the cellular secretory pathway is not involved in the glycosylation of T-ag; instead, a cytoplasmic mechanism might be involved."
