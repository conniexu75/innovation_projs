https://openalex.org/W2553076365,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been instrumental in inferring the roles of histone post-translational modifications in the regulation of transcription, chromatin compaction and other cellular processes that require modulation of chromatin structure. However, analysis of ChIP-seq data is challenging when the manipulation of a chromatin-modifying enzyme significantly affects global levels of histone post-translational modifications. For example, small molecule inhibition of the methyltransferase EZH2 reduces global levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). However, standard ChIP-seq normalization and analysis methods fail to detect a decrease upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment. We overcome this challenge by employing an alternative normalization approach that is based on the addition of Drosophila melanogaster chromatin and a D. melanogaster-specific antibody into standard ChIP reactions. Specifically, the use of an antibody that exclusively recognizes the D. melanogaster histone variant H2Av enables precipitation of D. melanogaster chromatin as a minor fraction of the total ChIP DNA. The D. melanogaster ChIP-seq tags are used to normalize the human ChIP-seq data from DMSO and EZH2 inhibitor-treated samples. Employing this strategy, a substantial reduction in H3K27me3 signal is now observed in ChIP-seq data from EZH2 inhibitor treated samples."
https://openalex.org/W2553568258,"Background New indices, calculated on data from the widely used Dot Probe Task, were recently proposed to capture variability in biased attention allocation. We observed that it remains unclear which data pattern is meant to be indicative of dynamic bias and thus to be captured by these indices. Moreover, we hypothesized that the new indices are sensitive to SD differences at the response time (RT) level in the absence of bias. Method Randomly generated datasets were analyzed to assess properties of the Attention Bias Variability (ABV) and Trial Level Bias Score (TL-BS) indices. Sensitivity to creating differences in 1) RT standard deviation, 2) mean RT, and 3) bias magnitude were assessed. In addition, two possible definitions of dynamic attention bias were explored by creating differences in 4) frequency of bias switching, and 5) bias magnitude in the presence of constant switching. Results ABV and TL-BS indices were found highly sensitive to increasing SD at the response time level, insensitive to increasing bias, linearly sensitive to increasing bias magnitude in the presence of bias switches, and non-linearly sensitive to increasing the frequency of bias switches. The ABV index was also found responsive to increasing mean response times in the absence of bias. Conclusion Recently proposed DPT derived variability indices cannot uncouple measurement error from bias variability. Significant group differences may be observed even if there is no bias present in any individual dataset. This renders the new indices in their current form unfit for empirical purposes. Our discussion focuses on fostering debate and ideas for new research to validate the potentially very important notion of biased attention being dynamic."

The islet-specific zinc transporter ZnT8 mediates granular sequestration of zinc ions. A genetic variant of human ZnT8 arising from a single nonsynonymous nucleotide change contributes to increased susceptibility to type-2 diabetes (T2D), but it remains unclear how the high risk variant (Arg-325), which is also a higher frequency (>50%) allele, is correlated with zinc transport activity. Here, we compared the activity of Arg-325 with that of a low risk ZnT8 variant (Trp-325). The Arg-325 variant was found to be more active than the Trp-325 form following induced expression in HEK293 cells. We further examined the functional consequences of changing lipid conditions to mimic the impact of lipid remodeling on ZnT8 activity during insulin granule biogenesis. Purified ZnT8 variants in proteoliposomes exhibited more than 4-fold functional tunability by the anionic phospholipids, lysophosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Over a broad range of permissive lipid compositions, the Arg-325 variant consistently exhibited accelerated zinc transport kinetics versus the Trp-form. In agreement with the human genetic finding that rare loss-of-function mutations in ZnT8 are associated with reduced T2D risk, our results suggested that the common high risk Arg-325 variant is hyperactive, and thus may be targeted for inhibition to reduce T2D risk in the general populations.

Ku also interacts with accessory factors such as aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase-like factor (APLF). Yet, how these factors interact to tether, process, and ligate DSB ends while allowing regulation and chromatin interactions remains enigmatic. Here, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and mutational analyses show APLF is largely an intrinsically disordered protein that binds Ku, Ku/DNA-PKcs (DNA-PK), and X4L4 within an extended flexible NHEJ core complex. X4L4 assembles with Ku heterodimers linked to DNA-PKcs via flexible Ku80 C-terminal regions (Ku80CTR) in a complex stabilized through APLF interactions with Ku, DNA-PK, and X4L4. Collective results unveil the solution architecture of the six-protein complex and suggest cooperative assembly of an extended flexible NHEJ core complex that supports APLF accessibility while possibly providing flexible attachment of the core complex to chromatin. The resulting dynamic tethering furthermore, provides geometric access of L4 catalytic domains to the DNA ends during ligation and of DNA-PKcs for targeted phosphorylation of other NHEJ proteins as well as trans-phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs on the opposing DSB without disrupting the core ligation complex. Overall the results shed light on evolutionary conservation of Ku, X4, and L4 activities, while explaining the observation that Ku80CTR and DNA-PKcs only occur in a subset of higher eukaryotes.

https://openalex.org/W2555544068,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that causes a wide range of infections including pneumonia, septicemia, necrotizing fasciitis and severe wound and urinary tract infections. Analysis of A. baumannii representative strains grown in Chelex 100-treated medium for hemolytic activity demonstrated that this pathogen is increasingly hemolytic to sheep, human and horse erythrocytes, which interestingly contain increasing amounts of phosphatidylcholine in their membranes. Bioinformatic, genetic and functional analyses of 19 A. baumannii isolates showed that the genomes of each strain contained two phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) genes, which were named plc1 and plc2. Accordingly, all of these strains were significantly hemolytic to horse erythrocytes and their culture supernatants tested positive for PC-PLC activity. Further analyses showed that the transcriptional expression of plc1 and plc2 and the production of phospholipase and thus hemolytic activity increased when bacteria were cultured under iron-chelation as compared to iron-rich conditions. Testing of the A. baumannii ATCC 19606T plc1::aph-FRT and plc2::aph isogenic insertion derivatives showed that these mutants had a significantly reduced PC-PLC activity as compared to the parental strain, while testing of plc1::ermAM/plc2::aph demonstrated that this double PC-PLC isogenic mutant expressed significantly reduced cytolytic and hemolytic activity. Interestingly, only plc1 was shown to contribute significantly to A. baumannii virulence using the Galleria mellonella infection model. Taken together, our data demonstrate that both PLC1 and PLC2, which have diverged from a common ancestor, play a concerted role in hemolytic and cytolytic activities; although PLC1 seems to play a more critical role in the virulence of A. baumannii when tested in an invertebrate model. These activities would provide access to intracellular iron stores this pathogen could use during growth in the infected host."

Salmonella spp. possess effector proteins that display biochemical activities and modulate host functions. Here, we generated a deletion mutant of the effector AvrA, S.E-AvrA−, and a plasmid-mediated complementary strain, S.E-AvrA−/pAvrA+ (S.E-AvrA+), in S. Enteritidis. Using in vitro and in vivo infection models, we showed that AvrA stabilizes epithelial tight junction (TJ) proteins, such as ZO-1, in human intestinal epithelial cells. Transepithelial electrical resistance was significantly higher in cells infected with S.E-AvrA+ than in cells infected with S.E-AvrA−. Inhibition of the JNK pathway suppresses the disassembly of TJ proteins; we found that enteritidis AvrA inhibited JNK activity in cells infected with wild type or S.E-AvrA+ strains. Therefore, Enteritidis AvrA-induced ZO-1 stability is achieved via suppression of the JNK pathway. Furthermore, the S.E-AvrA− strain led to enhanced bacterial invasion, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data reveal a novel role for AvrA in S. Enteritidis: Enteritidis AvrA stabilizes intestinal TJs and attenuates bacterial invasion.

Salmonella spp. are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobes, and intracellular pathogens in both humans and animals that pose a major public health problem worldwide. It is estimated that more than 1 million people acquire a Salmonella infection as a foodborne illness and that such infections contribute to >350 deaths annually in the United States (1.Scallan E.

Most Salmonella pathogenesis studies to date have focused on Salmonella typhimurium; thus, the pathogenesis of another major serotype, Salmonella Enteritidis, is poorly understood. Salmonella species possess a range of effector proteins that are translocated into host cells via a type III secretion system (14.Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A.

Ivanov A.I. c-Jun N-terminal kinase mediates disassembly of apical junctions in model intestinal epithelia.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 2110-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The intestinal epithelium is formed by a single layer of epithelial cells that separates the intestinal lumen from the underlying lamina propria. The space between these cells is sealed by TJs, which regulate the permeability of the intestinal barrier (26.Ulluwishewa D. Anderson R.C. McNabb W.C. Moughan P.J. Wells J.M. Roy N.C.

TJs are the most apical component of intercellular junctional complexes formed by integral membrane proteins such as occludin, claudin family members, and junctional adhesion molecules. The cytoplasmic domain of occludin and claudins binds to peripheral membrane proteins known as the zonula occludens (ZO), such as ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 (27.Kojima T. Kokai Y. Chiba H. Osanai M.

Signaling pathways involved in the assembly, disassembly, and maintenance of TJs are controlled by numerous signaling pathways, such as the protein kinase C, MAPK, myosin light chain kinase, and Rho GTPase pathways (30.Farhadi A.

The JNKs were originally identified based on their activation in response to environmental stress stimuli, such as bacterial infection. JNK binds and phosphorylates c-Jun within its transcriptional activation domain, and this signaling pathway generally contributes to inflammatory responses (34.Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Signal transduction by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK): from inflammation to development.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar).

Ma J. Xia Y. Ai X. Sun J. Bacterial protein AvrA stabilizes intestinal epithelial tight junctions via blockage of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway.Tissue Barriers. 2015; 3: e972849Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, the role of the bacterial effector AvrA in S. Enteritidis remains unknown. We hypothesized that S. Enteritidis AvrA stabilizes intestinal epithelial TJs and decreases bacterial invasion. Using S. Enteritidis-infected intestinal epithelial cells and a mouse colitis model, we found that enteritidis AvrA may reprogram the regulation of TJs in eukaryotic cells to benefit the pathogen. We first established an AvrA deletion mutant, S.E.-AvrA−, in S. Enteritidis strain C50336 using λ-Red-mediated recombination and complemented by plasmid pBR322-AvrA (Fig. 1). Our PCR data showed that the AvrA gene was deleted in the S.E-AvrA− mutant and restored in the complemented strain S.E-AvrA+ (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR verification of the AvrA gene transcription further confirmed the successful generation of the AvrA mutant and the complemented strain, with the GMK bacterial reference gene for normalization (Fig. 1B). Our Western blot data showed that the AvrA protein was absent in the mutant strain (S.E-AvrA−) and overexpressed in the complemented strain (S.E-AvrA+) (Fig. 1C). Ponceau S staining indicated even protein loading in each lane. The growth characteristics of the strains were determined in LB liquid medium; there was no difference between the AvrA mutant or complemented strains and the wild type C50336 strain (Fig. 1D). The mutant and complemented strains were characterized biochemically using the API 20E identification kit, which revealed no differences between the mutant and complemented strains relative to the wild type strain (Fig. 1E). ZO-1 is a TJ protein on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. In human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 BBE cells, ZO-1 protein levels were decreased after S.E-AvrA− infection compared with wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+ infection (Fig. 2A). Densitometry analysis showed a significant difference between cells infected with S.E-AvrA− and those infected with either wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+ (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, there were no significant changes in the TJ proteins occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-7 or the adhesion junction protein E-cadherin with or without S. Enteritidis colonization (Fig. 2A). We observed similar trends for ZO-1 following S.E-AvrA−, S.E-AvrA+, or wild type S.E infection in HCT116 and SKCO15 cells (Fig. 2, D and E). RT-PCR data showed no change in ZO-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2, F–H). We further determined the distribution of ZO-1 protein in Caco-2 BBE cells by immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3, ZO-1 localization was disrupted in S.E-AvrA−-infected cells but was unchanged in S.E-AvrA+ or wild type S.E-infected cells. There was no change in the adhesion junction protein E-cadherin with or without S. Enteritidis colonization (see Fig. 6E).FIGURE 6.S.

E-AvrA−-infected mouse colon; claudin-7, occluding, and E-cadherin expression was not changed in the mouse colon after infection with different strains of S. Enteritidis.

E, immunofluorescence shows the normal localization of ZO-1 (indicated by yellow arrows) in the control mouse colon and the disrupted localization (indicated by red arrows) following infection with AvrA mutant bacteria (top row). There was no significant difference in claudin-7 (middle row), E-Cadherin (bottom row) localization between the S.E-AvrA− strain and the wild type or complemented strains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The disruption of TJs results in greater intestinal epithelial cell permeability (38.Chen M.L.

Immun. 2006; 74: 6581-6589Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We next measured the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in human epithelial Caco-2 BBE cells (Fig. 3B). There was a dramatic decrease in TEER 1–8 h after S. Enteritidis infection, and this decrease was greater in S.E-AvrA−-infected cells than in S.E-AvrA+ or wild type S.E-infected cells (Fig. 3B). There was a significant difference between S.E-AvrA−-infected cells and wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-infected cells 2–8 h after S. Enteritidis infection (Fig. 3B). ZO-1 is regulated by the JNK signaling pathway (25.Naydenov N.G. Hopkins A.M.

Physiol. 2010; 225: 720-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting, we found that JNK signaling was activated, as indicated by the marked increase in JNK phosphorylation, in Caco-2 BBE, HCT116, and SKCO15 cells following S. Enteritidis colonization (Fig. 2). There was greater JNK phosphorylation in S.E-AvrA−-infected cells than in wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-infected cells. JNK pathway activation induces IL-8 production in epithelial cells (41.Hubert A. Cauliez B. Chedeville A. Husson A. Lavoinne A. Osmotic stress, a proinflammatory signal in Caco-2 cells.Biochimie. 2004; 86: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and JNK pathway-dependent expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine is shown in Fig. 4. In parallel with p-JNK, IL-8 levels in culture supernatant were higher 6 h after colonization with S.E-AvrA− compared with wild type S.E and S.E-AvrA+. Together, these results show that AvrA inhibits JNK activation in epithelial cells upon infection by S. Enteritidis. ZO-1 protein levels were inversely correlated with phosphorylated JNK levels. In S.E-AvrA−-infected cells, increased JNK phosphorylation correlated with reduced ZO-1 expression, whereas in wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-infected cells, ZO-1 protein levels did not change. The disruption of TJs results in greater intestinal epithelial cell permeability, as shown by the TEER changes in the epithelial cells following colonization by S. Enteritidis. Next, we determined the efficiency of bacterial invasion in human epithelial Caco-2 BBE cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, the S.E-AvrA−-colonized cells showed an increased intracellular bacterial load compared with those colonized with wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+. Therefore, we conclude that disrupting TJs also results in enhanced invasion of epithelial cells by S. Enteritidis. To study the role of the S. Enteritidis protein AvrA in an in vivo model of natural intestinal infection, we used the streptomycin pretreatment mouse model of enteric salmonellosis (42.Barthel M. Hapfelmeier S. Quintanilla-Martínez L. Kremer M. Rohde M. Hogardt M. Pfeffer K. Rüssmann H. Hardt W.D.

Enteritidis C50336, S.E-AvrA−, or S.E-AvrA+ by oral gavage. Mice cecal histopathology was graded with a semiquantitative scale (43.Vijay-Kumar M. Wu H. Jones R. Grant G. Babbin B. King T.P. Kelly D.

Enteritidis infection, including goblet cell loss, polymorphonuclear cell infiltration into the lamina propria, and epithelial damage (Fig. 5A). Mice infected with S.E-AvrA− showed a marked increase in the pro-inflammatory response compared with mice infected with the wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+ strain (Fig. 5, B and C). In vitro, we found that the S. Enteritidis protein AvrA inhibits the JNK pathway and stabilizes the TJ protein ZO-1. In colonic samples from S.E-AvrA−-infected mice, ZO-1 protein expression was significantly decreased (Fig. 6, A and B) in parallel with increased JNK phosphorylation compared with samples from wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-infected mice (Fig. 6, A and C). No changes were observed in the expression levels of claudin-7, occluding, or E-cadherin (Fig. 6A). RT-PCR showed that ZO-1 mRNA levels in the mouse colon were not altered by S.E-AvrA−, S.E-AvrA+ or wild type S.E infection (Fig. 6D). Immunofluorescence analysis of mouse colonic tissues further confirmed that ZO-1 localization was disrupted in S.E-AvrA−-infected mice compared with S.E-AvrA+- or wild type S.E-infected mice (Fig. 6E). Similar to the Western blotting results, there was no change in claudin-7 or E-cadherin (Fig. 6E) by immunofluorescence. Next, we investigated bacterial invasion in the mouse colon. In our model, bacterial colonization was measureable in the mouse colon. There was a significantly higher bacterial load in S.E-AvrA−-colonized colon tissue than in wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-colonized colon tissue (Fig. 7A), whereas there was no evidence of Salmonella in the uninfected control mice. We also measured serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in S. Enteritidis-infected mice, using Luminex assays (Fig. 7, B and C). The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (Fig. 7B) and TNF-α (Fig. 7C) were not increased at 8 h after Salmonella infection. However, after 4 days, the concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were markedly increased in S.E-AvrA−-infected mice compared with wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+-infected mice. We confirmed the changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at the mRNA level using RT-PCR: IL-6 (Fig. 7D) and TNF-α (Fig. 7E). mRNA expression was significantly increased in S.E.-AvrA−-infected colons. Our results indicate that S. Enteritidis AvrA decreases bacterial invasion and reduces inflammation. To confirm whether AvrA stabilizes the TJ protein ZO-1 via the JNK pathway, we treated Caco-2 BBE cells with a JNK inhibitor (SP600125) to determine whether inhibiting the JNK pathway destabilizes ZO-1 in S.E-AvrA−-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 8 (A–C), after treatment with the JNK inhibitor, phosphorylated JNK was nearly undetectable in S.E-AvrA−, S.E-AvrA+, or wild type S.E-infected cells. However, the JNK inhibitor did not disrupt ZO-1 expression in S.E-AvrA−-infected cells. RT-PCR supported the observation that the JNK inhibitor had no effect on ZO-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 8D). Inhibiting the JNK pathway decreased the expression of the JNK-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8, even after Salmonella infection, and no difference was observed among the S.E-AvrA−, S.E-AvrA+, or wild type S.E strains post-infection (Fig. 8E). Together, AvrA-induced suppression of the JNK pathway and TJ protein disassembly increases ZO-1 stability following S. Enteritidis infection. In the current study, we report that the S. Enteritidis effector protein AvrA stabilizes the TJ protein ZO-1, thus preserving intestinal epithelial permeability and decreasing bacterial invasion. Bacterial AvrA-mediated regulation of host TJs involves blocking the JNK signaling pathway, which was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 8F). The S. Enteritidis protein AvrA inhibits the JNK pathway in epithelial cells, enhances TJ barrier function by stabilizing ZO-1 expression at the protein level, increases cell permeability, reduces bacteria invasion, and reduces the inflammatory response in mice. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished the stabilizing effect of AvrA on ZO-1. Most Salmonella pathogenesis studies to date have focused on S. Typhimurium. In this study, we are the first to report that the S. Enteritidis effector protein AvrA inhibits the JNK pathway, thereby preventing intestinal epithelial barrier disruption, and normalizes the expression of the TJ protein ZO-1. There are numerous serotypes of Salmonella; different serotypes are found in different animal hosts or environments, and they may cause different symptoms in humans (6.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Salmonella serotype enteritidis infections among workers producing poultry vaccine: Maine, November-December 2006.MMWR Morb.

In this work, evidence that GlnR is also directly involved in the regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is provided.

These findings also indicate that GlnR is not only a master nitrogen regulator but also an important controller of secondary metabolism, which may help to balance nitrogen metabolism and antibiotic biosynthesis in streptomycetes. Actinobacteria, such as the soil-dwelling genus Streptomyces, are characterized by their robust capacity to produce a vast array of valuable secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics, anticancer drugs, immunosuppressants and anthelminthic agents. The biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in actinomycetes is governed by complex regulatory networks involving both global/pleiotropic and pathway-specific regulators (1.Martín J.F. Liras P.

A better understanding of these regulatory networks is critically important for strain improvement by metabolic engineering or synthetic biology approaches (1.Martín J.F. Liras P.

GlnR, an OmpR-type orphan two-component response regulator, is a well characterized master regulator of nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R.

GlnR-mediated nitrogen regulation has been most intensively studied in the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor. The GlnR regulon has been determined and includes at least 15 genes that encode proteins (mainly enzymes) involved in nitrogen source uptake and signal sensing (the amtB-glnK-glnD operon), alternative nitrogen source utilization (nirB, nasA, and ureA) and glutamine/glutamate synthesis (glnA, glnII, and gdhA) (6.Tiffert Y.

Microbiol. 2008; 67: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The role of GlnR has also been investigated in other actinomycetes, including Streptomyces venezuelae (8.Pullan S.T. Chandra G. Bibb M.J. Merrick M. Genome-wide analysis of the role of GlnR in Streptomyces venezuelae provides new insights into global nitrogen regulation in actinomycetes.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 175Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), Amycolatopsis mediterranei (9.Yu H. Yao Y. Liu Y. Jiao R. Jiang W. Zhao G.P. A complex role of Amycolatopsis mediterranei GlnR in nitrogen metabolism and related antibiotics production.Arch. Microbiol. 2007; 188: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and Saccharopolyspora erythraea (10.Yao L.L. Liao C.H. Huang G. Zhou Y. Rigali S. Zhang B. Ye B.C. GlnR-mediated regulation of nitrogen metabolism in the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora erythraea.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2014; 98: 7935-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), among others. For instance, in S. venezuelae, a genome-wide analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) was performed and revealed the presence of 36 GlnR-binding sites, mainly located upstream of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism (8.Pullan S.T. Chandra G. Bibb M.J. Merrick M. Genome-wide analysis of the role of GlnR in Streptomyces venezuelae provides new insights into global nitrogen regulation in actinomycetes.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 175Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has revealed that GlnR also plays an important role in carbon metabolism and mediates the interplay between nitrogen and carbon metabolism in actinomycetes. In Streptomyces coelicolor, GlnR was identified as a transcriptional regulator for the expression of the agl3EFG operon, which encodes a putative carbohydrate transporter (11.Cen X.F. Wang J.Z. Zhao G.P. Wang Y. Wang J. Molecular evidence for the coordination of nitrogen and carbon metabolisms, revealed by a study on the transcriptional regulation of the agl3EFG operon that encodes a putative carbohydrate transporter in Streptomyces coelicolor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 471: 510-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated that GlnR directly regulates the uptake and utilization of non-phosphotransferase system carbon sources in S. erythraea. The expression of most (13 of 20) carbohydrate ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters was activated by GlnR in response to nitrogen availability (12.Liao C.H. Yao L. Xu Y. Liu W.B. Zhou Y. Ye B.C. Nitrogen regulator GInR controls uptake and utilization of non-phosphotransferase-system carbon sources in actinomycetes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112: 15630-15635Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, GlnR-mediated control of carbohydrate transport may be highly conserved among actinomycetes. In addition to its global regulation in primary metabolism (i.e. nitrogen and carbon metabolism), GlnR may also be closely associated with antibiotic biosynthesis in actinomycetes. For instance, in the rifamycin-producing strain A. mediterranei, GlnR is involved in the suppression of rifamycin biosynthesis in the absence of nitrate (9.Yu H. Yao Y. Liu Y. Jiao R. Jiang W. Zhao G.P. A complex role of Amycolatopsis mediterranei GlnR in nitrogen metabolism and related antibiotics production.Arch. Microbiol. 2007; 188: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In S. coelicolor, the glnR mutation led to defective production of two colored antibiotics, blue-colored actinorhodin (ACT) and red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin (RED) (7.Tiffert Y. Franz-Wachtel M. Fladerer C. Nordheim A. Reuther J. Wohlleben W. Mast Y. Proteomic analysis of the GlnR-mediated response to nitrogen limitation in Streptomyces coelicolor M145.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2011; 89: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Previously, it was generally believed that the role of GlnR in antibiotic biosynthesis was an indirect consequence of its activity in nitrogen metabolism. However, increasing evidence has suggested the direct involvement of GlnR in antibiotic biosynthesis in streptomycetes. In S. venezuelae, ChIP-chip analysis indicated that GlnR is likely to directly activate the expression of jadR1, a pathway-specific activator of jadomycin biosynthesis (8.Pullan S.T. Chandra G. Bibb M.J. Merrick M. Genome-wide analysis of the role of GlnR in Streptomyces venezuelae provides new insights into global nitrogen regulation in actinomycetes.BMC Genomics. 2011; 12: 175Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A differential role for GlnR was described in validamycin A biosynthesis of Streptomyces hygroscopicus 5008, where GlnR binds to different loci in the intergenic region of valK-valA (13.Qu S. Kang Q. Wu H. Wang L. Bai L. Positive and negative regulation of GlnR in validamycin A biosynthesis by binding to different loci in promoter region.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 99: 4771-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, whether GlnR-mediated regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is a universal strategy adopted by Streptomyces strains is still unknown. Recently, cross-regulation in nitrogen metabolism between GlnR and the two-component system (TCS) 5The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component system; CRISPR, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Cas, CRISPR-associated proteins; FAM, fluorescent 6-carboxyfluorescein; MS, mannitol soya; sgRNA, single guide RNA; TSS, transcriptional start site; nt, nucleotide(s); qRT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-PCR. 5The abbreviations used are: TCS, two-component system; CRISPR, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats; Cas, CRISPR-associated proteins; FAM, fluorescent 6-carboxyfluorescein; MS, mannitol soya; sgRNA, single guide RNA; TSS, transcriptional start site; nt, nucleotide(s); qRT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-PCR. AfsQ1-Q2, which functions as an activator of antibiotic biosynthesis, has been identified in S. coelicolor (14.Wang R. Mast Y. Wang J. Zhang W. Zhao G. Wohlleben W. Lu Y. Jiang W. Identification of two-component system AfsQ1/Q2 regulon and its cross-regulation with GlnR in Streptomyces coelicolor.Mol. Microbiol. 2013; 87: 30-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The response regulator AfsQ1 was found to specifically bind to the promoter regions of GlnR-regulated target genes, such as glnA and nirB, thereby regulating nitrogen metabolism. Moreover, the minimal binding sequences recognized by AfsQ1 upstream of the pathway-specific regulatory genes redZ and cdaR are very similar to two copies of the “a site” (GTnAC) from the previously identified S. coelicolor GlnR box (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R. Reuther J. The Streptomyces coelicolor GlnR regulon: identification of new GlnR targets and evidence for a central role of GlnR in nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These data suggest a reciprocal cross-regulation between GlnR and AfsQ1-Q2 and that GlnR might exert its function on antibiotic biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoter regions of the pathway-specific regulatory genes. Here, the mechanism underlying the function of GlnR in antibiotic biosynthesis in S. coelicolor was studied. We demonstrate that GlnR regulates the biosynthesis of ACT and RED via direct interactions with the promoter regions of the pathway-specific activator genes, actII-ORF4 and redZ, respectively. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism underlying the function of GlnRsav (encoded by SAV_4042, a GlnR homologue from Streptomyces avermitilis) in avermectin and oligomycin production was also determined. Our results suggest that GlnR-mediated regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis may be universal among streptomycetes. To investigate the role of the master nitrogen metabolism regulator GlnR in the antibiotic biosynthesis of S. coelicolor M145, the production of two colored antibiotics, ACT and RED, was compared between the ΔglnR mutant and the wild-type strain M145 under MS and R2YE culture conditions, respectively. The ΔglnR mutant was generated previously using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system (15.Huang H. Zheng G. Jiang W. Hu H. Lu Y. One-step high-efficiency CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in Streptomyces.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2015; 47: 231-243Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In comparison with M145, the ΔglnR mutant exhibited impaired bacterial growth on both culture conditions, particularly during the early growth stage (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The defective growth of the mutant was possibly due to its lack of nitrogen assimilation and sugar transportation after glnR removal. Moreover, we observed that under the tested culture conditions, glnR inactivation resulted in altered antibiotic production. Quantitative analysis of ACT and RED production showed that on R2YE agar plates, compared with M145, the ΔglnR mutant exhibited reduced ACT biosynthesis at the early stages (before 72 h) but enhanced ACT biosynthesis after 72 h. The reduced ACT production of the mutant during the early stage is likely due to the greatly impaired bacterial growth. Decreased RED production was observed throughout the experiment course in the ΔglnR mutant (supplemental Fig. S1). On MS agar, only enhanced ACT levels were detected in the mutant when compared with M145; no RED production was detected in either strain (supplemental Fig. S2). Herein, we aimed to perform an in-depth study into the role of GlnR in antibiotic biosynthesis under the R2YE culture condition, which is a rich medium often used for the analysis of antibiotic production in S. coelicolor. To verify that the phenotypic changes in the ΔglnR mutant were indeed ascribed to glnR removal, a complementation assay was performed. Three strains, namely, M145 with the empty pIB139 vector (M145/pIB139), ΔglnR with pIB139 (ΔglnR/pIB139), and the complemented strain (ΔglnR/pIB-glnR) were constructed, and the phenotypes were analyzed on R2YE agar plates. The phenotypic alterations in bacterial growth and ACT and RED production could be restored upon introduction of the wild-type glnR gene under control of the strong and constitutive promoter ermE*p (Fig. 1). The data presented here clearly suggested that the master nitrogen regulator GlnR plays a differential role in antibiotic biosynthesis of S. coelicolor under R2YE culture conditions. To assess whether GlnR exerts its effects on ACT and RED biosynthesis directly via the respective pathway-specific activator genes, actII-ORF4 (for ACT biosynthesis) and redZ/redD (for RED production), we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis using purified His6-GlnR protein. Three probes containing the respective promoter regions of these three pathway-specific activator genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of M145. The glnR promoter region, which has no interaction with GlnR (16.Fink D. Weissschuh N. Reuther J. Wohlleben W. Engels A. Two transcriptional regulators GlnR and GlnRII are involved in regulation of nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 331-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. Purified His6-GlnR specifically bound to the promoter regions of actII-ORF4 and redZ but not to the redD and glnR probes (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we compared the transcript levels of actII-ORF4 and redZ between the ΔglnR mutant and M145 by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). RNA samples were isolated from these two strains grown on R2YE agar medium for 48 and 72 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, actII-ORF4 expression was increased by over 2-fold upon glnR deletion at 72 h. However, its expression was drastically down-regulated in the ΔglnR mutant compared with that in M145 at 48 h. Expression of redZ was decreased by more than 2-fold in the mutant when compared with that of M145 at 48 h. Because the ΔglnR mutant exhibited markedly impaired growth during the early stage (especially before 48 h), we could not exclude the possibility that the down-regulations in actII-ORF4 and redZ expression in the ΔglnR mutant were due to the greatly impaired growth of the mutant. To determine the precise GlnR-binding sequences for regulation of actII-ORF4 expression, DNase I footprinting assays were conducted using a FAM-labeled actII-ORF4 probe, as reported previously (17.Wang Y. Cen X.F. Zhao G.P. Wang J. Characterization of a new GlnR binding box in the promoter of amtB in Streptomyces coelicolor inferred a PhoP/GlnR competitive binding mechanism for transcriptional regulation of amtB.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 5237-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A 32-nt GlnR-protected area was present in the actII-ORF4 promoter region, spanning from nucleotide position −77 to −46 relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS) (Fig. 3). In the GlnR-protected area upstream of actII-ORF4, only one 5-nt GlnR box (5′-GTGAC-3′) similar to the previously described sequence (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R. Reuther J. The Streptomyces coelicolor GlnR regulon: identification of new GlnR targets and evidence for a central role of GlnR in nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was found. Base mutations of the 16-nt sequence (5′-GGAGATCGCTTGTGAC-3′) had no effect on the binding affinity of GlnR, indicating that this sequence is not required for GlnR binding. Further mutations of the remaining 16-nt DNA sequence led to a complete loss of GlnR binding affinity, indicating that the 16-nt sequence 5′-TAATTTTTGATCAATA-3′ is required for GlnR-mediated regulation of actII-ORF4 expression (Fig. 3). However, no typical GlnR boxes as identified previously in Actinobacteria were detected (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R. Reuther J. The Streptomyces coelicolor GlnR regulon: identification of new GlnR targets and evidence for a central role of GlnR in nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To further verify the role of GlnR in ACT biosynthesis, base substitutions of the putative GlnR-binding sequence 5′-CGTACGACTTGACCGT-3′ upstream of actII-ORF4 in the M145 genome were created (Fig. 4A). Unfortunately, we failed to generate the mutant with targeted base mutations in a single step using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated technology. Therefore, we tried a two-step approach, including deletion of the actII-ORF4 promoter region and then in situ complementation of the mutated promoter region, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and finally obtained the actIIpmu mutant. Subsequently, the phenotypic changes in ACT production and actII-ORF4 transcription were compared between the actIIpmu mutant and M145. As seen in Fig. 4, we observed that mutations in the GlnR-binding site in the actII-ORF4 promoter region resulted in markedly enhanced ACT production throughout the time course assessed. The actIIpmu mutant produced 3.3, 3.1, 3.3, 4.5, and 5.1 times more ACT levels than did the parental strain M145 at 60, 72, 96, 120, and 140 h, respectively. In addition, we observed that the actIIpmu mutant achieved a higher level of ACT production in a shorter time than the ΔglnR mutant, possibly because bacterial growth in this strain was unaffected by mutating only the GlnR-binding site upstream of actII-ORF4. Similar to the phenotypic changes in ACT production, actII-ORF4 transcription was significantly up-regulated upon base substitutions in the GlnR-binding site. Therefore, it could be concluded that GlnR serves as a repressor of ACT biosynthesis, and its effect is directly mediated by the pathway-specific activator gene actII-ORF4. Similar to the actII-ORF4 studies, DNase I footprinting assays were performed using a FAM-labeled redZ probe to determine the GlnR-binding sequence upstream of redZ. As shown in Fig. 5A, the GlnR protection region upstream of redZ extended from the nucleotide position −103 to −57 with respect to the transcriptional start site (TSS). In the GlnR protection region upstream of redZ, a signature sequence, 5′-GAAAC-n6-GTATC-3′, was found; this sequence is similar to the consensus GlnR-binding sequence 5′-gTnAC-n6-GaAAc-3′ identified in a previous study (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R. Reuther J. The Streptomyces coelicolor GlnR regulon: identification of new GlnR targets and evidence for a central role of GlnR in nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 861-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm the importance of this signature sequence for GlnR binding, we introduced base mutations into the two 5-nt boxes, the intervening 6-nt spacer and the flanking sequences (Fig. 5C), and the binding affinities between GlnR and the mutated probes were assessed by EMSA. The binding activities of GlnR to the mutated probes (redZpmutA, redZpmutB, and redZpmutC, with base substitutions in both or either of two 5-nt boxes) were completely abolished, whereas mutations in the intervening and the flanking sequences (redZpmutD and redZpmutE) had little effect on binding affinities (Fig. 5D). These results clearly demonstrated that the signature sequence (5′-GAAAC-n6-GTATC-3′) is crucial for GlnR binding and is likely to serve as the operator of GlnR. In agreement with the positive role of GlnR in redZ transcription, the GlnR-binding site (5′-GAAAC-n6-GTATC-3′) is located upstream of the redZ promoter and spans from the nucleotide position −80 to −65 relative to the redZ TSS. To further assess the function of GlnR in RED biosynthesis and to exclude the possibility that the down-regulation of redZ expression is due to impaired bacterial growth upon glnR deletion, base substitutions in the GlnR-binding site, as illustrated in Fig. 6, were introduced into the redZ promoter region in the M145 genome using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing method to generate the redZmu mutant. Then, the effects of base substitutions on RED production and redZ transcription were analyzed. Mutations of the GlnR-binding site led to reduced redZ expression (48 h) and accordingly slightly decreased RED biosynthesis (reduced to 67% of the level in M145), confirming the positive role of GlnR in RED production by binding to the redZ promoter region. Interestingly, we found that RED production in the ΔglnR mutant was much lower than that in the redZmu mutant (Figs. 1 and 6), possibly due to the markedly impaired bacterial growth upon glnR deletion. GlnR homologues are widespread in Streptomyces strains, and GlnR-mediated regulation of nitrogen metabolism is highly conserved among different streptomycetes (6.Tiffert Y. Supra P. Wurm R. Wohlleben W. Wagner R. Reuther J. The Streptomyces coelicolor GlnR regulon: identification of new GlnR targets and evidence for a central role of GlnR in nitrogen metabolism in actinomycetes.Mol.

Nitrogen metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor: transcriptional and post-translational regulation.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2007; 12: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, to investigate whether GlnR-dependent regulation of antibiotic biosynthesis is also universal among Streptomyces, the function of GlnRsav (a homologue of GlnR encoded by SAV_4042) in S. avermitilis NRRL 8165 was studied, and a ΔglnRsav mutant with an in-frame deletion of the glnRsav gene was constructed. Compared with the wild-type strain NRRL 8165 grown on MS agar plates, ΔglnRsav grew more slowly and exhibited defective spore formation (Fig. 7, A and B). Further quantitative analysis of the production of two antibiotics, avermectin and oligomycin, demonstrated that glnRsav deletion up-regulated oligomycin but down-regulated avermectin biosynthesis. As seen in Fig. 7C, at two tested time points, no avermectin B1a (the main component of avermectin) was detected in the ΔglnRsav mutant (with the control vector pIB139). In contrast, oligomycin A (the main component of oligomycin) was produced ∼3-fold higher levels in the ΔglnRsav mutant (with pIB139) than in the wild-type strain (with pIB139) (Fig. 7D). Introduction of the wild-type glnRsav gene into the ΔglnRsav mutant under control of the strong and constitutive promoter ermE*p, readily restored antibiotic production, along with growth and development (Fig. 7, C and D). These results suggest that GlnRsav plays an important role in avermectin and oligomycin biosynthesis in S. avermitilis, inferring that GlnR-mediated antibiotic regulation might be universal in Streptomyces. To determine whether GlnRsav regulates avermectin and oligomycin biosynthesis directly via the respective cluster-situated regulatory genes aveR (for avermectin biosynthesis) and olmRI/olmRII (for oligomycin biosynthesis), EMSA experiments were performed with purified His6-GlnRsav protein and three Cy5-labeled probes harboring the respective promoter regions of aveR, olmRI, and olmRII. The probe containing the promoter region of GlnRsav (glnRsavp) was used as a negative control. GlnR bound specifically to the promoter regions of all three tested probes but not to the control probe glnRsavp (Fig. 8A). Subsequently, we assessed the effects of glnRsav deletion on antibiotic production at the transcriptional level. Transcription of these three regulatory genes was compared between the ΔglnRsav mutant and NRRL 8165 by qRT-PCR. RNA samples were isolated from the cultures grown on MS agar plates for 3 or 5 days. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that glnRsav deletion resulted in at least a 3-fold enhancement in olmRII/olmRII expression and significantly reduced aveR expression by over 2-fold (Fig. 8B), consistent with the phenotypic changes in antibiotic biosynthesis observed in the ΔglnRsav mutant. These results clearly suggest that GlnRsav plays a differential role in avermectin and oligomycin biosynthesis via directly regulating aveR and olmRI/RII expression, respectively. In this study, we demonstrated that the master nitrogen metabolism regulator GlnR functions as an important player during antibiotic biosynthesis in two Streptomyces strains under the tested culture conditions, including the modelstrain S. coelicolor M145 and the avermectin-producing strain S. avermitilis NRRL 8165. We showed that GlnR-mediated regulation of the biosynthesis of four antibiotics in these two strains (ACT and RED from S. coelicolor and avermectin and oligomycin from S. avermitilis) is directly mediated by the pathway-specific regulators. To the best of our knowledge, this report describes the first experimental evidence indicating that GlnR regulates antibiotic biosynthesis directly through pathway-specific regulators in the genus Streptomyces.

By contrast, both TRPC4 and TRPC1 were necessary for monovalent cation entry evoked by (−)-EA, and (−)-EA-evoked cell death was dependent upon entry of the monovalent cation Na+. We therefore hypothesized that Na+/K+-ATPase might act protectively by counteracting the Na+ load resulting from sustained Na+ entry.

https://openalex.org/W2555709927,"Atypical chemokine receptors do not mediate chemotaxis or G protein signaling, but they recruit arrestin. They also efficiently scavenge their chemokine ligands, thereby contributing to gradient maintenance and termination. ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, binds and degrades the constitutive chemokine CXCL12, which also binds the canonical receptor CXCR4, and CXCL11, which also binds CXCR3. Here we report comprehensive mutational analysis of the ACKR3 interaction with its chemokine ligands, using 30 substitution mutants. Readouts are radioligand binding competition, arrestin recruitment, and chemokine scavenging. Our results suggest different binding modes for both chemokines. CXCL11 depends on the ACKR3 N terminus and some extracellular loop (ECL) positions for primary binding, ECL residues mediate secondary binding and arrestin recruitment potency. CXCL12 binding required key residues Asp-1794.60 and Asp-2756.58 (residue numbering follows the Ballesteros-Weinstein scheme), with no evident involvement of N-terminal residues, suggesting an uncommon mode of receptor engagement. Mutation of residues corresponding to CRS2 in CXCR4 (positions Ser-1032.63 and Gln-3017.39) increased CXCL11 binding, but reduced CXCL12 affinity. Mutant Q301E7.39 did not recruit arrestin. Mutant K118A3.26 in ECL1 showed moderate baseline arrestin recruitment with ablation of ligand-induced responses. Substitutions that affected CXCL11 binding also diminished scavenging. However, detection of reduced CXCL12 scavenging by mutants with impaired CXCL12 affinity required drastically reduced receptor expression levels, suggesting that scavenging pathways can be saturated and that CXCL12 binding exceeds scavenging at higher receptor expression levels. Arrestin recruitment did not correlate with scavenging; although Q301E7.39 degraded chemokines in the absence of arrestin, S103D2.63 had reduced CXCL11 scavenging despite intact arrestin responses."

However, its effects in the heart remains unknown. This study sought to determine the effects of irisin on hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and its relationship with HDAC4. Wild type and stable HDAC4-overexpression cells were generated from H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. HDAC4 overexpression cells and wild type H9c2 cells were exposed to 24 hours of hypoxia followed by one hour of reoxygenation in vitro in the presence or absence of irisin (5 ng/ml). Cell cytotoxicity, apoptosis, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) were determined. Western blotting was employed to determine active-caspase 3, annexin V, and HDAC4 expression. As compared to wild type H9c2 group, HDAC4 overexpression remarkably led to a great increase in cell death as evident by the increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, ratio of caspase-3-positive cells as well as the upregulated levels of active-caspase 3 and annexin V shown by western blot analysis. In addition, HDAC4 overexpression also induced much severe mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by apoptotic mitochondria and increased mPTP. However, irisin treatment significantly attenuated all of these effects. Though irisin treatment did not influence the expression of HDAC4 at the transcriptional level, western blot analysis showed that HDAC4 protein levels decreased in a time-dependent way after administration of irisin, which is associated with the degradation of HDAC4 mediated by small ubiquitin-like modification (SUMO). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the protective effects of irisin in cardiomyoblasts exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation might be associated with HDAC4 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2553994990,"The numerical cognition literature offers two views to explain numerical and arithmetical development. The unique-representation view considers the approximate number system (ANS) to represent the magnitude of both symbolic and non-symbolic numbers and to be the basis of numerical learning. In contrast, the dual-representation view suggests that symbolic and non-symbolic skills rely on different magnitude representations and that it is the ability to build an exact representation of symbolic numbers that underlies math learning. Support for these hypotheses has come mainly from correlative studies with inconsistent results. In this study, we developed two training programs aiming at enhancing the magnitude processing of either non-symbolic numbers or symbolic numbers and compared their effects on arithmetic skills. Fifty-six preschoolers were randomly assigned to one of three 10-session-training conditions: (1) non-symbolic training (2) symbolic training and (3) control training working on story understanding. Both numerical training conditions were significantly more efficient than the control condition in improving magnitude processing. Moreover, symbolic training led to a significantly larger improvement in arithmetic than did non-symbolic training and the control condition. These results support the dual-representation view."
https://openalex.org/W2551044271,"Virus-host interactions play a role in many stages of the viral lifecycle, including entry. Reovirus, a model system for studying the entry mechanisms of nonenveloped viruses, undergoes a series of regulated structural transitions that culminate in delivery of the viral genetic material. Lipids can trigger one of these conformational changes, infectious subviral particle (ISVP)-to-ISVP* conversion.

Host entry, a critical stage in the viral lifecycle, is necessary for incoming virus to initiate a productive infection. This step is characterized by host cell attachment, internalization, and subsequent delivery of the viral genetic material (1.Smith A.E. Helenius A.

Many of the conformational changes that define reovirus entry can be recapitulated in vitro; ISVPs are produced by digesting purified virions with chymotrypsin (41.Borsa J. Copps T.P.

Lipids, a host factor that reovirus particles are likely to encounter during host entry, can also promote ISVP* formation (9.Snyder A.J. Danthi P. Lipid membranes facilitate conformational changes required for reovirus cell entry.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This study investigates a mechanism for lipid- and myr-μ1N-mediated reovirus entry. Following cleavage and release from μ1, myr-μ1N may serve two functions: (i) myr-μ1N generates pores within the host endosomal membrane (33.Agosto M.A. Ivanovic T. Nibert M.L. Mammalian reovirus, a nonfusogenic nonenveloped virus, forms size-selective pores in a model membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A positive-feedback mechanism promotes reovirus particle conversion to the intermediate associated with membrane penetration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We propose a model in which the pore-forming activity and the ISVP*-promoting activity are linked. First, myr-μ1N promotes ISVP* formation most efficiently when lipids are present. Second, the addition of exogenous myr-μ1N to a low concentration of ISVPs alters the reaction kinetics of ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion. Third, host proteins are not required for myr-μ1N to recruit ISVPs to a lipid bilayer. Thus, membrane-embedded myr-μ1N interacts with ISVPs and induces ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion. This work reveals a heretofore unknown mechanism in which membranes can actively participate in the entry pathway of a nonenveloped virus. ISVPs undergo multiple structural transitions to generate ISVP*s. These conformational changes occur within an infected cell and are necessary for establishing a productive infection (35.Chandran K. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Strategy for nonenveloped virus entry: a hydrophobic conformer of the reovirus membrane penetration protein μ1 mediates membrane disruption.J.

Virol. 2010; 84: 12723-12732Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Triggering ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion in vitro with heat renders the particles noninfectious (44.Middleton J.K. Severson T.F. Chandran K. Gillian A.L. Yin J. Nibert M.L. Thermostability of reovirus disassembly intermediates (ISVPs) correlates with genetic, biochemical, and thermodynamic properties of major surface protein μ1.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At high particle concentration (2 × 1012 particles/ml or 3 nm), liposomes facilitate ISVP* formation in a lipid composition-dependent manner (9.Snyder A.J. Danthi P. Lipid membranes facilitate conformational changes required for reovirus cell entry.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test whether lipids also render reovirus particles noninfectious, we conducted 20-min heat inactivation experiments over a range of temperatures in the absence or presence of early endosome (EE), l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC), or PC/l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (2:1) liposomes. As described previously, liposomes composed of PC/PE induce ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion as efficiently as EE liposomes. Liposomes composed of PC alone can also trigger ISVP* formation, albeit to a lesser extent (9.Snyder A.J. Danthi P. Lipid membranes facilitate conformational changes required for reovirus cell entry.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). At high particle concentration (Fig. 1A), reovirus type 3 Dearing (T3D) ISVPs were more susceptible to thermal inactivation in the presence of liposomes when compared with T3D ISVPs alone. At 43 °C, T3D ISVPs incubated with EE or PC/PE (2:1) liposomes were reduced in titer by ∼4.5 log10 units relative to control virus incubated at 4 °C. Consistent with a mechanism in which liposomes promote ISVP* formation in a lipid composition-dependent manner (9.Snyder A.J. Danthi P. Lipid membranes facilitate conformational changes required for reovirus cell entry.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), T3D ISVPs incubated with PC liposomes were less susceptible to thermal inactivation when compared with virus incubated with EE or PC/PE (2:1) liposomes; viral titer was reduced by less than 0.5 log10 unit at 43 °C and by ∼4 log10 units at 46 °C. T3D ISVPs alone were reduced in titer by only ∼2 log10 units following incubation at 49 °C. As a consequence of ISVP* formation, the reovirus outer capsid protein, μ1, reorganizes into a protease-sensitive conformation (35.Chandran K. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Strategy for nonenveloped virus entry: a hydrophobic conformer of the reovirus membrane penetration protein μ1 mediates membrane disruption.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9920-9933Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). After incubating T3D ISVPs in the absence or presence of liposomes under conditions identical to Fig. 1A, this structural transition was assayed by determining the susceptibility of the δ fragment (a product of μ1 cleavage during ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion) to trypsin digestion (Fig. 1B) (35.Chandran K.

Consistent with the thermal inactivation curves shown in Fig. 1A, inclusion of EE, PC, or PC/PE (2:1) liposomes reduced the temperature that was required to render δ protease-sensitive. At the high particle concentration used in Fig. 1, A and B (2 × 1012 particles/ml or 3 nm), ISVP* formation induced by heat does not follow first-order kinetics (34.Borsa J. Long D.G.

In contrast, ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion at low particle concentration (e.g. 2 × 109 particles/ml or 0.003 nm) has been shown to approximate a first-order reaction (44.Middleton J.K. Severson T.F.

As such, by measuring the rate of infectivity loss at low particle concentration, three thermodynamic parameters can be calculated: enthalpy of activation (ΔH‡), entropy of activation (ΔS‡), and free energy of activation (ΔG‡) (44.Middleton J.K.

To test the hypothesis that lipids facilitate ISVP* formation by lowering the energy barrier of the reaction, T3D ISVPs (2 × 109 particles/ml or 0.003 nm) were incubated for 20 min over a range of temperatures in the absence or presence of EE, PC, or PC/PE (2:1) liposomes (Fig. 1C). At low particle concentration (i.e. conditions that are more likely to arise during infection), we expected ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion to occur most efficiently when lipids were present. Nonetheless, T3D ISVPs alone and T3D ISVPs incubated with liposomes were equally susceptible to thermal inactivation at 42, 45, and 55 °C. At 49 and 52 °C, virus incubated with liposomes was reduced in titer to a greater extent than virus alone; however, the difference in infectivity was less than 1 log10 unit. Similar results were obtained using the trypsin sensitivity assay (Fig. 1D). At 49 °C, the μ1 δ fragment was only marginally more sensitive to trypsin digestion in virus incubated with liposomes when compared with virus alone.

Strategies to enhance satiation peptide secretion could provide a therapeutic approach for obesity. Carbohydrates and lipids have been extensively investigated in relation to peptide release. In contrast, the role of proteins or amino acids is less clear. Our aim was to compare the effects of the amino acids L-tryptophan (L-trp) and L-leucine (L-leu) separately on gastric emptying and gut peptide secretion. Participants/Methods The study was conducted as a randomized (balanced), double-blind, parallel-group trial. A total of 10 lean and 10 non-diabetic obese participants were included. Participants received intragastric loads of L-trp (0.52 g and 1.56 g) and L-leu (1.56 g), dissolved in 300 mL tap water; 75 g glucose and 300 mL tap water served as control treatments. Results Results of the study are: i) L-trp at the higher dose stimulates CCK release (p = 0.0018), and induces a significant retardation in gastric emptying (p = 0.0033); ii) L-trp at the higher dose induced a small increase in GLP-1 secretion (p = 0.0257); iii) neither of the amino acids modulated subjective appetite feelings; and iv) the two amino acids did not alter insulin or glucose concentrations. Conclusions L-trp is a luminal regulator of CCK release with effects on gastric emptying, an effect that could be mediated by CCK. L-trp’s effect on GLP-1 secretion is only minor. At the doses given, the two amino acids did not affect subjective appetite feelings. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02563847"
https://openalex.org/W2554606147,"Objectives We aimed to describe labor market participation (LMP) of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Switzerland, to examine potential determinants of LMP, and to compare LMP between SCI and the general population. Methods We analyzed data from 1458 participants of employable age from the cross-sectional community survey of the Swiss Spinal Cord Injury Cohort Study. Data on LMP of the Swiss general population were obtained from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Factors associated with employment status as well as the amount of work performed in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) were examined with regression techniques. Results 53.4% of the participants were employed at the time of the study. Adjusted odds of being employed were increased for males (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.33–2.25) and participants with paraplegia (OR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.40–2.27). The likelihood of being employed showed a significant concave relationship with age, peaking at age 40. The relation of LMP with education was s-shaped, while LMP was linearly related to time since injury. On average, employment rates were 30% lower than in the general population. Males with tetraplegia aged between 40 and 54 showed the greatest difference. From the 771 employed persons, the majority (81.7%) worked part-time with a median of 50% FTE (IRQ: 40%-80%). Men, those with younger age, higher education, incomplete lesions, and non-traumatic etiology showed significantly increased odds of working more hours per week. Significantly more people worked part-time than in the general population with the greatest difference found for males with tetraplegia aged between 40 and 54. Conclusions LMP of persons with SCI is comparatively high in Switzerland. LMP after SCI is, however, considerably lower than in the general population. Future research needs to show whether the reduced LMP in SCI reflects individual capacity adjustment, contextual constraints on higher LMP or both."
https://openalex.org/W2556659484,"Macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of liver granuloma and fibrosis in schistosomiasis. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. This study revealed that the macrophages infiltrating the liver tissues in a murine model of Schistosoma japonica infection exhibited M2 functional polarization, and Notch1/Jagged1 signaling was significantly upregulated in the M2 polarized macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the blockade of Notch signaling pathway by a γ–secretase inhibitor could reverse macrophage M2 polarization in vitro and alleviate liver granuloma and fibrosis in the murine model of schistosomiasis. These results implied that the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling-dependent M2 polarization of macrophages might play an important role in liver granuloma and fibrosis in schistosomiasis, and the inhibition of Notch1/Jagged1 signaling might provide a novel therapeutic approach to administrate patients with schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2556479463,"Transcription factor tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP/NFAT5) is critical for osmo-adaptation and extracellular matrix homeostasis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in their hypertonic tissue niche. Recent studies implicate TonEBP signaling in inflammatory disease and rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. However, broader functions of TonEBP in the disc remain unknown. RNA sequencing was performed on NP cells with TonEBP knockdown under hypertonic conditions. 1140 TonEBP-dependent genes were identified and categorized using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed enrichment of matrix homeostasis and cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) were studied further. Knockdown experiments showed that TonEBP was necessary to maintain expression levels of these genes. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that TonEBP binding to a specific site in the CCL2 promoter is required for hypertonic inducibility. Despite inhibition by dominant-negative TonEBP, IL6 and NOS2 promoters were not hypertonicity-inducible. Whole-disc response to hypertonicity was studied in an ex vivo organ culture model, using wild-type and haploinsufficient TonEBP mice. Pro-inflammatory targets were induced by hypertonicity in discs from wild-type but not TonEBP-haploinsufficient mice. Mechanistically, NF-κB activity increased with hypertonicity and was necessary for hypertonic induction of target genes IL6, TNF, and NOS2 but not CCL2. Although TonEBP maintains transcription of genes traditionally considered pro-inflammatory, it is important to note that some of these genes also serve anabolic and pro-survival roles. Therefore, in NP cells, this phenomenon may reflect a physiological adaptation to diurnal osmotic loading of the intervertebral disc. Transcription factor tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP/NFAT5) is critical for osmo-adaptation and extracellular matrix homeostasis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells in their hypertonic tissue niche. Recent studies implicate TonEBP signaling in inflammatory disease and rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. However, broader functions of TonEBP in the disc remain unknown. RNA sequencing was performed on NP cells with TonEBP knockdown under hypertonic conditions. 1140 TonEBP-dependent genes were identified and categorized using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed enrichment of matrix homeostasis and cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) were studied further.

Therefore, in NP cells, this phenomenon may reflect a physiological adaptation to diurnal osmotic loading of the intervertebral disc. The intervertebral disc is well suited to fulfill its mechanical role in the human spine, where it permits flexion and rotation, and absorbs compressive loads (1.Inoue N. Espinoza Orías A.A.

Although the high fixed charge density of the aggrecan-rich matrix allows the nucleus pulposus its water-imbibing properties, it also results in a hypertonic environment for NP cells. Importantly, tonicity of the extracellular environment fluctuates widely with diurnal cycle: water is forced out of the disc during the day when the spine is loaded and imbibed during the unloaded phase at night (6.Matsumura Y. Kasai Y. Obata H. Matsushima S. Inaba T. Uchida A. Changes in water content of intervertebral discs and paravertebral muscles before and after bed rest.J. Orthop.

In mammalian cells, a key transcription factor TonEBP (NFAT5) is activated by elevated hypertonicity and promotes transcription of genes that produce or transport organic osmolytes (7.Burg M.B.

Ther. 2010; 12: R100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the broader functions of TonEBP in the hypertonic niche of the NP. The goal of this study was to elucidate whether TonEBP promotes transcription of inflammation-related genes in NP cells, even under physiologically relevant hypertonic conditions. RNA sequencing showed that TonEBP controls activities of several inflammation- and matrix turnover-related pathways. Using in vitro and ex vivo approaches and employing TonEBP haploinsufficient mice, our results demonstrate that TonEBP and NF-κB participate in activation of pro-inflammatory genes in response to hypertonic stimulus in NP cells. We hypothesize that this phenomenon reflects a physiological adaptation of NP cells to diurnal osmotic loading of the intervertebral disc and may be critical for cellular homeostasis. NP cells were transduced with either control (ShCTR) or TonEBP-specific (ShTonEBP) shRNA and cultured in hypertonic medium for 8 h to recapitulate the physiological state of the NP. We verified significant reduction in TonEBP mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels (89.8 ± 5% decrease in protein) (Fig. 1, A and B). RNA sequencing results represented by the heat map and volcano plot (Fig. 1, C and D) depict 1140 differentially expressed transcripts (adjusted p value < 0.05), with 73 showing a log 2 (-fold change) >1.2. We validated our dataset by examining levels of known TonEBP targets Akr1b1, Igfbp7, Aqp1, Sgk1, Col1a1, and Col1a2, whose expression level changes matched previously reported data (Fig. 1E) (7.Burg M.B.

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to identify the top pathways and functions associated with the list of differentially expressed genes (supplemental Tables 1 and 2, supplemental Fig. 1). Due to enrichment of catabolic and cytokine/chemokine-related pathways, we generated a list of all differentially expressed inflammation-related genes to investigate the role of TonEBP controlling these processes (Fig. 1F). Three genes from the list, CCL2, IL6, and NOS2, associated with disc degeneration, along with TNF, a known TonEBP target in fibroblasts (13.Esensten J.H. Tsytsykova A.V. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Ligeiro F.A. Rao A. Goldfeld A.E. NFAT5 binds to the TNF promoter distinctly from NFATp, c, 3 and 4, and activates TNF transcription during hypertonic stress alone.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), were further investigated. We tested whether hypertonicity induces pro-inflammatory genes by culturing NP cells under hypertonic conditions for up to 24 h. TonEBP mRNA was significantly induced by 8 h (Fig. 1G) with a concomitant induction in CCL2, IL6, TNF, and NOS2, which subsided by 24 h (Fig. 1G). CCL2 protein was also higher at 8 h after the addition of NaCl (Fig. 1H). Interestingly, levels of IL6 and TNFα protein were unaffected by hypertonicity (Fig. 1, I and J), suggesting that acute transcript increases may be required for maintenance of baseline protein expression under hypertonicity. To explore whether this regulation involved TonEBP, we analyzed the 2-kb promoter upstream of the transcription start site of these genes for potential TonEBP binding motifs (TonE). Analysis showed several predicted TonE in all promoters evaluated (Table 1). To gain an understanding of how well these TonE were conserved between species, we performed Multiz alignment of the rat, human, and mouse genomes and calculated the degree of alignment of the whole TonE (overall alignment) and alignment of the core binding sequence of the TonE (core alignment).TABLE 1Prediction of TonE's in first 2-kb proximal promoters of inflammatory genes and their conservation between rat, human, and mouse genomes Open table in a new tab The presence of several, highly conserved predicted TonE in the CCL2 proximal promoter led us to study this promoter in more depth. We studied these TonE and overall conservation of the promoter using the Evolutionary Conserved Regions browser (Fig. 2, A and B). Based on these findings, we experimentally examined the responsiveness of the CCL2 promoter, which contains three potential TonE, to manipulation of tonicity and TonEBP levels. To test whether TonEBP bound to the promoter, we mutated TonE #2, which has a high predictive score and high core binding site conservation and is active in kidney cells (12.Kojima R. Taniguchi H. Tsuzuki A. Nakamura K. Sakakura Y. Ito M. Hypertonicity-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 through a novel cis-acting element and MAPK signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5253-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Activity of the wild-type CCL2 promoter was induced by hypertonicity, and mutation of TonE #2 abolished this increase (Fig. 2D). Expression of dominant-negative TonEBP (DN-TonEBP) also inhibited hypertonic induction of the wild-type promoter (Fig. 2E), similar to activity of the taurine transporter (TauT) promoter, a well characterized TonEBP target. Under isotonic conditions, DN-TonEBP did not affect the wild-type CCL2 promoter (Fig. 2F). However, overexpression of TonEBP under isotonic conditions led to a dose-dependent increase in CCL2 promoter activity (Fig. 2G); the TonE-mutated CCL2 promoter was unresponsive (Fig. 2H). We then evaluated the activities of the proximal IL6 (Fig. 3A) and NOS2 (Fig. 3B) promoters. Unlike the CCL2 promoter, IL6 promoter activity was unaffected by hypertonicity (Fig. 3C) and NOS2 promoter activity was decreased (Fig. 3D). However, DN-TonEBP inhibited activities of both promoters under hypertonic conditions (Fig. 3, C and D). Expression of DN-TonEBP under isotonic conditions led to a slight reduction in IL6 promoter activity (Fig. 3E), but did not affect the NOS2 promoter (Fig. 3F). Surprisingly, in both cases, overexpression of TonEBP also suppressed the promoter activities (Fig. 3, G and H). We next tested whether hypertonicity-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory genes was TonEBP-dependent by knocking down TonEBP in NP cells under isotonic or hypertonic conditions. In control cells (ShCTR), we observed hypertonicity-dependent induction in mRNAs for TonEBP, TauT, CCL2, and TNF (Fig. 4, A–C and E) but not of IL6 or NOS2 (Fig. 4, D and F). Regardless of inducibility, TonEBP knockdown was sufficient to decrease mRNA levels of all genes evaluated. We then examined protein levels of CCL2, IL6, and TNFα (Fig. 4, G–I). TonEBP silencing significantly decreased levels of CCL2 under both isotonic and hypertonic conditions. Although there was a trend of decreased IL6 and TNFα levels in TonEBP-silenced cells under hypertonicity, significant decrease was seen under isotonic conditions. We used a whole-disc organ culture model to assess the effect of hypertonicity on inflammatory gene expression by disc cells in their native extracellular matrices, using wild-type and haploinsufficient TonEBP+/− mice (Fig. 5, A and B) (20.Go W.Y. Liu X. Roti M.A. Liu F. Ho S.N. NFAT5/TonEBP mutant mice define osmotic stress as a critical feature of the lymphoid microenvironment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). At this age, the overall structure, size, and health of discs from the two genotypes did not appear grossly different (Fig. 5C); weight of TonEBP+/− mice at euthanasia was slightly lower than wild-type mice (Fig. 5D). As expected, discal levels of TonEBP mRNA from haploinsufficient animals were about half of wild-type animals (Fig. 5E). Although the induction in SMIT mRNA was abolished in heterozygous animals, induction in TauT mRNA was less affected by TonEBP haploinsufficiency, indicating that some targets may be more sensitive to TonEBP modulation than others (Fig. 5, F and G). Transcript levels of CCL2, IL6, TNF, and NOS2 were induced in discs from wild-type animals. However, discs from TonEBP+/− animals failed to induce levels of any of these transcripts under hypertonicity (Fig. 5, H–K). Because the NF-κB pathway is a common regulator of the pro-inflammatory genes studied here, we investigated the relationship between hypertonicity, TonEBP, and NF-κB signaling in NP cells. Hypertonicity increased activity of the NF-κB-responsive reporter, and this induction was blocked by DN-TonEBP. Interestingly, under isotonic conditions, TonEBP overexpression had no effect on NF-κB activity (Fig. 6A) and p65-mediated induction of NF-κB activity was not affected by overexpression of TonEBP or DN-TonEBP (Fig. 6B). Because both TonEBP and p65 are Rel family members and undergo homo/heterodimerization to promote transcription, we investigated their interaction. Immunoprecipitations failed to show association between these proteins, regardless of tonicity or presence of TNFα (Fig. 6C), whereas we were able to detect interaction between p65 and its known interacting protein, IκBα. We then tested whether NF-κB signaling contributed to hypertonic induction of pro-inflammatory targets using SM7368, an inhibitor that blocks TNFα-dependent NF-κB reporter activity (Fig. 6D). Despite inhibiting NF-κB activation, TauT (Fig. 6E) and CCL2 (Fig. 6F) were induced by hypertonicity. In contrast, SM7368 blocked hypertonic induction of IL6 (Fig. 6G), TNF (Fig. 6H), and NOS2 (Fig. 6I). NP cells reside in a hypertonic environment within the disc, the severity of which fluctuates with daily activity (6.Matsumura Y. Kasai Y. Obata H. Matsushima S. Inaba T. Uchida A.

RNA sequencing and subsequent investigation showed that TonEBP maintained CCL2 mRNA and protein and IL6 and TNFα mRNA expression levels. Although TonEBP maintained IL6 and TNFα protein levels under isotonic conditions, this was not the case under hypertonicity. It is possible that under hypertonicity another factor compensates for TonEBP absence to maintain IL6 and TNFα protein levels at the post-transcriptional stage. Previous reports have demonstrated hypertonic induction of CCL2, IL6, and TNF (12.Kojima R. Taniguchi H. Tsuzuki A. Nakamura K. Sakakura Y. Ito M.

On the other hand, hypertonicity suppressed LPS-mediated IL6 production in macrophages (16.Kim N.-H. Hong B.-K. Choi S.Y. Moo Kwon H. Cho C.-S. Yi E.C. Kim W.-U. Reactive oxygen species regulate context-dependent inhibition of NFAT5 target genes.Exp. Mol. Med. 2013; 45: e32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the TonEBP-mediated response to hypertonicity is likely cell-type specific. Timing of this response may also depend on cell type, as we detected only a very transient induction in mRNA levels of these targets. We have shown that the CCL2 gene is induced by hypertonicity and that this induction requires the action of TonEBP on a highly conserved TonE. Our result is in agreement with a previous study in kidney cells, which showed a lack of hypertonic response after deleting this TonE (12.Kojima R. Taniguchi H. Tsuzuki A. Nakamura K. Sakakura Y. Ito M. Hypertonicity-induced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 through a novel cis-acting element and MAPK signaling pathways.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 5253-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although they were not inducible by hypertonicity, maintenance of the IL6 and NOS2 promoters under hypertonic conditions required TonEBP. In addition, overexpression studies demonstrated that precise control of TonEBP levels was crucial in sustaining promoter activities. These studies suggest that, in NP cells, control of IL6 and NOS2 transcription by TonEBP may be unique. In LPS-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, TonEBP, indeed, bound to the region containing predicted TonE in IL6 and NOS2 promoters, pointing to context- and cell type-specific differences in the mechanism by which TonEBP controls these genes (15.Buxadé M. Lunazzi G. Minguillón J. Iborra S. Berga-Bolaños R. Del Val M. Aramburu J. López-Rodríguez C. Gene expression induced by Toll-like receptors in macrophages requires the transcription factor NFAT5.J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Induction may also involve post-transcriptional mechanisms, including increased mRNA stability via osmo-sensitive micro RNAs (25.Huang W. Liu H. Wang T. Zhang T. Kuang J. Luo Y. Chung S.S.M. Yuan L. Yang J.Y. Tonicity-responsive microRNAs contribute to the maximal induction of osmoregulatory transcription factor OREBP in response to high-NaCl hypertonicity.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further insights into inflammatory gene regulation came from ex vivo organ culture studies performed using haploinsufficient TonEBP mice. This organ culture preserves the native cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions in all disc compartments. Therefore, these organ culture studies confirmed that hypertonicity-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory genes required TonEBP and was not due to a stress response evoked by a sudden change in tonicity. Canonical TonEBP targets TauT and SMIT displayed differing sensitivities to TonEBP levels, suggesting that TonEBP preferentially activates transcription of some targets, such as TauT, over others. Because NF-κB controls expression of many inflammatory genes, we investigated potential cross-talk between TonEBP and RelA. The effect of hypertonicity on NF-κB activity appears to be cell type-specific, with reports of both inductive (26.Roth I. Leroy V. Kwon H.M. Martin P.-Y. Féraille E. Hasler U.

In NP cells, NF-κB activity was controlled in a TonEBP-dependent manner under hypertonic conditions. TonEBP modulation did not affect p65-dependent NF-κB activity under isotonic conditions, indicating that hypertonicity produces a permissive environment for cross-talk between TonEBP and NF-κB signaling. However, the lack of TonEBP immunoprecipitation with p65 showed that cross-talk does not involve physical interaction.

The fault tree of third-party damage containing 56 basic events was built by hazard identification of third-party damage. The fuzzy evaluation of basic event probabilities were conducted by the expert judgment method and using membership function of fuzzy set. The determination of the weight of each expert and the modification of the evaluation opinions were accomplished using the improved analytic hierarchy process, and the failure possibility of the third-party to urban gas pipeline was calculated.

Aromatic rings (TyrB16, PheB24, PheB25, 3-I-TyrB26, and their symmetry-related mates) at this interface adjust to enable packing of the hydrophobic iodine atoms within the core of each monomer. Strikingly, these features were observed in the crystal structure of a 3-[iodo-TyrB26]insulin analog (determined as an R6 zinc hexamer). Given that residues B24–B30 detach from the core on receptor binding, the environment of 3-I-TyrB26 in a receptor complex must differ from that in the free hormone. Based on the recent structure of a “micro-receptor” complex, we predict that 3-I-TyrB26 engages the receptor via directional halogen bonding and halogen-directed hydrogen bonding as follows: favorable electrostatic interactions exploiting, respectively, the halogen's electron-deficient σ-hole and electronegative equatorial band.

The objective was to identify predictors of poor health outcome at 10 years of follow-up in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Population-based sample from 6 U.S. communities. Participants 4,355 participants In the MESA Study. Measurements Poor health outcome at 10 years of follow-up was defined as having died or having clinical cardiovascular disease, depression, cognitive impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer. Absolute risk regression was used to estimate risk differences in the outcome adjusting for demographic variables, clinical and behavioral risk factors, subclinical cardiovascular disease, and ApoE genotype. Models were weighted to account for selective attrition. Results Mean age at 10 years of follow-up was 69.5 years; 1,480 participants had a poor health outcome, 2,157 participants were in good health, and 718 were unknown. Older age, smoking, not taking a statin, hypertension, diabetes, and higher coronary calcium score were associated with higher probability of poor health outcome. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the lowest income and educational categories had 7 to 14% greater absolute risk of poor health outcome at 10 years of follow-up compared to those in the next highest categories of income or education (P = 0.002 for both). Those in the lowest categories of both income and education had 21% greater absolute risk of poor health outcome compared to those in the highest categories of both income and education. Conclusions Low income and educational level predict poor health outcome at 10 years of follow-up in an aging cohort, independent of clinical and behavioral risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2551626322,"Pancreatic cancer is a fatal malignancy worldwide and urgently requires valid therapies. Previous research showed that the HDAC inhibitor chidamide is a promising anti-cancer agent in pancreatic cancer cell lines. In this study, we elucidate a probable underlying anti-cancer mechanism of chidamide involving the degradation of Mcl-1. Mcl-1 is frequently upregulated in human cancers, which has been demonstrated to participate in oxidative phosphorylation, in addition to its anti-apoptotic actions as a Bcl-2 family member. The pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC-3 and PANC-1 were treated with chidamide, resulting in Mcl-1 degradation accompanied by induction of Mcl-1 ubiquitination. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor reduced Mcl-1 degradation stimulated by chidamide. Chidamide decreased O2 consumption and ATP production to inhibit aerobic metabolism in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary cells, similar to knockdown of Mcl-1, while overexpression of Mcl-1 in pancreatic cancer cells could restore the aerobic metabolism inhibited by chidamide. Furthermore, chidamide treatment or Mcl-1 knockdown significantly induced cell growth arrest in pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary cells, and Mcl-1 overexpression could reduce this cell growth inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggest that chidamide promotes Mcl-1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, suppressing the maintenance of mitochondrial aerobic respiration by Mcl-1, and resulting in inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. Our work supports the claim that chidamide has therapeutic potential for pancreatic cancer treatment."

Methods Sixty obese (OBE) and 27 normal-weight (NW) children and adolescents (age: 9–17) were assessed for body representation using a multi-method approach. Therefore, we assessed body size estimation, tactile size estimation, heartbeat detection accuracy, and attitudes towards one’s own body. OBE were examined upon admission and before discharge of an inpatient weight-reduction program. NW served as cross-sectional control group. Results Body size estimation and heartbeat detection accuracy were similar in OBE and NW. OBE overestimated sizes in tactile size estimation and were more dissatisfied with their body as compared to NW. In OBE but not in NW, several measures of body size estimation correlated with negative body evaluation. After weight-loss treatment, OBE had improved in heartbeat detection accuracy and were less dissatisfied with their body. None of the assessed variables predicted weight-loss success. Conclusions Although OBE children and adolescents generally perceived their body size and internal status of the body accurately, weight reduction improved their heartbeat detection accuracy and body dissatisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2555867514,"E-26 transformation-specific (ETS) proteins are transcription factors directing gene expression through their conserved DNA binding domain. They are implicated as truncated forms or interchromosomal rearrangements in a variety of tumors including Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric tumor of the bone. Tumor cells express the chimeric oncoprotein EWS-FLI1 from a specific t(22;11)(q24;12) translocation. EWS-FLI1 harbors a strong transactivation domain from EWSR1 and the DNA-binding ETS domain of FLI1 in the C-terminal part of the protein. Although Ewing cells are crucially dependent on continuous expression of EWS-FLI1, its regulation of turnover has not been characterized in detail. Here, we identify the EWS-FLI1 protein as a substrate of the ubiquitin-proteasome system with a characteristic polyubiquitination pattern. Using a global protein stability approach, we determined the half-life of EWS-FLI1 to lie between 2 and 4 h, whereas full-length EWSR1 and FLI1 were more stable. By mass spectrometry, we identified two ubiquitin acceptor lysine residues of which only mutation of Lys-380 in the ETS domain of the FLI1 part abolished EWS-FLI1 ubiquitination and stabilized the protein posttranslationally. Expression of this highly stable mutant protein in Ewing cells while simultaneously depleting the endogenous wild type protein differentially modulates two subgroups of target genes to be either EWS-FLI1 protein-dependent or turnover-dependent. The majority of target genes are in an unaltered state and cannot be further activated. Our study provides novel insights into EWS-FLI1 turnover, a critical pathway in Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis, and lays new ground to develop novel therapeutic strategies in Ewing sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2552573990,"A major rate-limiting step for Aβ generation and deposition in Alzheimer's disease brains is BACE1-mediated cleavage (β-cleavage) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously reported that APP undergoes palmitoylation at two cysteine residues (Cys186 and Cys187) in the E1-ectodomain. 8-10% of total APP is palmitoylated in vitro and in vivo. Palmitoylated APP (palAPP) shows greater preference for β-cleavage than total APP in detergent resistant lipid rafts. Protein palmitoylation is known to promote protein dimerization. Since dimerization of APP at its E1-ectodomain results in elevated BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP, we have now investigated whether palmitoylation of APP affects its dimerization and whether this leads to elevated β-cleavage of the protein. Here we report that over 90% of palAPP is dimerized while only ~20% of total APP forms dimers. PalAPP-dimers are predominantly cis-oriented while total APP dimerizes in both cis- and trans-orientation. PalAPP forms dimers 4.5-times more efficiently than total APP. Overexpression of the palmitoylating enzymes DHHC7 and DHHC21 that increase palAPP levels and Aβ release, also increased APP dimerization in cells. Conversely, inhibition of APP palmitoylation by pharmacological inhibitors reduced APP-dimerization in coimmunoprecipitation and FLIM/FRET assays. Finally, in vitro BACE1-activity assays demonstrate that palmitoylation-dependent dimerization of APP promotes β-cleavage of APP in lipid-rich detergent resistant cell membranes (DRMs), when compared to total APP. Most importantly, generation of sAPPβ-sAPPβ dimers is dependent on APP-palmitoylation while total sAPPβ generation is not. Since BACE1 shows preference for palAPP dimers over total APP, palAPP dimers may serve as novel targets for effective β-cleavage inhibitors of APP as opposed to BACE1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2556383313,"Introduction Diabetes Mellitus is currently a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where a significant proportion of diabetes cases are now found. Longitudinal profiling of in-patient admissions and mortality trends from diabetes provide useful insights into the magnitude of the burden of diabetes, serve as a sentinel on the state of out-patient diabetes care and provide effective tools for planning, delivering and evaluating the health care needs relating to the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Objective To evaluate the 31-year trend in diabetic admissions and mortality rates in central Ghana. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of data on diabetes admissions and deaths at a tertiary referral hospital in central Ghana between 1983 and 2014. Rates of diabetes admissions or deaths were expressed as diabetes admissions or deaths divided by the total number of admissions or deaths respectively. Yearly crude fatality rates for diabetes were calculated. Trends were analysed for in patient diabetes admissions and mortality for the period. Predictors of diabetes mortality were determined using multiple logistic regression. Results A total of 11,414 diabetes patients were admitted over the period with a female predominance; female:male ratio of 1.3:1.0. Over the study period, diabetes admission rates increased significantly from 2.36 per 1000 admissions in 1983 to 14.94 per 1000 admissions in 2014 (p<0.0001for linear trend), representing a 633% rise over the 31-year period. In-patient diabetes fatality rates increased from 7.6 per 1000 deaths in 1983 to 30 per 1000 deaths in 2012. The average 28-day mortality rate was 18.5%. The median age of patients increased significantly over the period. So was the proportion of females admitted over the years. Predictors of in-patient mortality were increasing age- aOR of 1.23 (CI: 1.15–1.32) for age > 80 years compared with < 20 years, admissions in 2000s compared to 1980s-aOR of 1.56 (1.21–2.01), male gender-aOR of 1.45 (1.19–1.61), the presence of glycemic complications such as ketoacidosis- aOR-2.67(CI: 2.21–3.21), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states- aOR 1.52 (1.33–1.73) symptomatic hypoglycemia- aOR 1.64 (1.24–2.17) and presence of end organ complications including peripheral neuropathic ulcers- aOR 1.31 (1.12–1.56), nephropathy- aOR -1.11 (1.03–1.23), cerebrovascular disease—aOR-1.52 (1.32–1.98), coronary artery disease- aOR-3.21 (1.91–5.15) and peripheral artery disease- aOR-1.15 (1.12–1.21) were associated with increased risk of death compared with normoglycemic diabetic admissions and admissions without end organ complications respectively. Conclusion Diabetes admission and mortality rates have increased significantly over the past three decades in central Ghana. More intensive education on the risk factors for diabetes, acute diabetes care as well as instituting hospital guidelines for diabetes control and reduction of modifiable risk factors for diabetes are urgently needed to reduce the poor case fatality associated with diabetes in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2556156688,"The study of stable isotopes in fossil bioapatite has yielded useful results and has shown that bioapatites are able to faithfully record paleo-environmental and paleo-climatic parameters from archeological to geological timescales. In an effort to establish new proxies for the study of bioapatites, intra-tooth records of enamel carbonate stable isotope ratios from a modern horse are compared with trace element profiles measured using laboratory micro X-Ray Fluorescence scanning. Using known patterns of tooth eruption and the relationship between stable oxygen isotopes and local temperature seasonality, an age model is constructed that links records from six cheek upper right teeth from the second premolar to the third molar. When plotted on this age model, the trace element ratios from horse tooth enamel show a seasonal pattern with a small shift in phase compared to stable oxygen isotope ratios. While stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in tooth enamel are forced respectively by the state of the hydrological cycle and the animal's diet, we argue that the seasonal signal in trace elements reflects seasonal changes in dust intake and diet of the animal. The latter explanation is in agreement with seasonal changes observed in carbon isotopes of the same teeth. This external forcing of trace element composition in mammal tooth enamel implies that trace element ratios may be used as proxies for seasonal changes in paleo-environment and paleo-diet."

However, this function only becomes apparent when other processing enzymes are absent, raising the question of its primary physiological role.

The RNase Z family of enzymes is widespread among organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. These RNases generally participate in the 3′ processing of tRNA precursors lacking an encoded CCA sequence, cleaving right after the discriminator nucleotide to generate a substrate for CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (1.Deutscher M.P.

Ribonucleases play an important role in cellular RNA metabolism, and recent studies have revealed that these enzymes may act as important regulators of small RNAs (sRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are: sRNA, small RNA; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; nt, nucleotide(s). 2The abbreviations used are: sRNA, small RNA; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; nt, nucleotide(s). by participating in their maturation or turnover (12.Saramago M.

Regulating the regulators: how ribonucleases dictate the rules in the control of small non-coding RNAs.RNA Biol. 2008; 5: 230-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 6S RNA, a stable sRNA, is an important transcription regulator that acts by binding to the sigma 70-containing holoenzyme of RNA polymerase (Eσ70) and reducing its activity (14.Cavanagh A.T. Wassarman K.M. 6S RNA, a global regulator of transcription in Escherichia coliBacillus subtilis, and beyond.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In late stationary phase, 6S RNA accumulates to high levels and binds the vast majority of Eσ70, leading to reduced transcription of many σ70-dependent genes (15.Wassarman K.M. Storz G. 6S RNA regulates E. coli RNA polymerase activity.Cell. 2000; 101: 613-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The mechanism driving accumulation of 6S RNA in stationary phase remains unclear. Although regulated transcription contributes to its accumulation in stationary phase (16.Lee J.Y. Park H. Bak G. Kim K.S. Lee Y. Regulation of transcription from two ssrS promoters in 6S RNA biogenesis.Mol. Cells. 2013; 36: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), increased stability was also suggested to be an important determinant (14.Cavanagh A.T. Wassarman K.M. 6S RNA, a global regulator of transcription in Escherichia coliBacillus subtilis, and beyond.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, ribonucleases that affect 6S RNA stability have not yet been identified in E. coli or any other bacterium (17.Beckmann B.M. Hoch P.G. Marz M. Willkomm D.K. Salas M. Hartmann R.K. A pRNA-induced structural rearrangement triggers 6S-1 RNA release from RNA polymerase in Bacillus subtilis.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 6S RNA is also used as a template by RNA polymerase to produce a small RNA, termed pRNA. The synthesis of pRNA is most apparent during outgrowth, leading to dissociation of a 6S RNA:pRNA duplex from the polymerase (18.Wassarman K.M. Saecker R.M. Synthesis-mediated release of a small RNA inhibitor of RNA polymerase.Science. 2006; 314: 1601-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The released RNA polymerase functions to increase transcription during outgrowth, whereas the released 6S RNA:pRNA is rapidly degraded by as yet unidentified ribonucleases. In this study, we find that RNase BN regulates the levels of certain sRNAs, such as 6S RNA, during exponential phase. We first show that RNase BN itself is regulated, being present at a high level in exponential phase, but decreasing dramatically in stationary phase. As a consequence, 6S RNA remains low during exponential phase and is stabilized and accumulates in stationary phase cells as RNase BN disappears. In vitro assays revealed that RNase BN can directly cleave 6S RNA using its endoribonuclease activity. Furthermore, the 6S RNA:pRNA duplex is an even more favorable substrate than is free 6S RNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that a primary role of RNase BN in E. coli may be to down-regulate certain sRNAs in exponential phase cells. As a first step to understand the physiological function of RNase BN in E. coli, we analyzed its chromosomal expression during different phases of growth. Samples were taken from early exponential phase to late stationary phase for measurement of rbn message and FLAG-tagged RNase BN protein. rbn mRNA, as detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A), was found to be at its highest level from early to mid-exponential phase (A600 = 0.1–0.5). After that time, rbn mRNA decreased rapidly to less than 10% of its exponential phase value in late stationary phase. Likewise, FLAG-tagged RNase BN protein, detected by Western analysis using anti-FLAG antibody, increased rapidly and was also most abundant in exponential phase, but was reduced to barely detectable levels in late stationary phase, as indicated by the Western blot in Fig. 1B. These data indicate that expression of RNase BN is strongly dependent on growth phase, and they suggest that this enzyme functions primarily in exponential phase. The close correlation between rbn mRNA and RNase BN protein also suggests that its regulation is most likely at the transcriptional level. In view of the dramatic decrease of RNase BN from exponential to stationary phase, we speculated that it might affect the levels of some sRNAs, which often are also expressed in a growth-dependent manner. To test this idea, we determined the relative amounts of several sRNAs in wild type and Δrbn mutant cells using Northern analysis. These sRNAs were chosen because their abundance made them convenient to detect and because their amounts generally varied with growth phase. As shown in Table 1, six sRNAs (Nos. 1–6) were expressed at higher levels in stationary phase when compared with exponential phase, in agreement with earlier work (15.Wassarman K.M.

In the absence of RNase BN, the levels of four of these sRNAs were unaffected, but two of them, SibE and 6S RNA, increased ∼2-fold in exponential phase, whereas remaining unchanged in stationary phase (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Examination of several additional sRNAs (Nos. 7–10) revealed that two of them, GcvB and OxyS, were also elevated during exponential phase in the RNase BN mutant, although their amounts normally decrease or remain the same in stationary phase (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). These data implicate RNase BN in contributing to the levels of certain sRNAs in exponential phase cells. To examine this point in more detail, the rest of the study focuses on how RNase BN controls the abundance of 6S RNA, a known regulator of transcription by the RNA polymerase Eσ70 holoenzyme (14.Cavanagh A.T. Wassarman K.M. 6S RNA, a global regulator of transcription in Escherichia coliBacillus subtilis, and beyond.Annu. Rev.

Open table in a new tab To determine how RNase BN affects 6S RNA abundance, we first compared the accumulation of 6S RNA in wild type and Δrbn mutant cells throughout a complete growth cycle using Northern analysis (Fig. 2). When an overnight culture of wild type cells was diluted into fresh medium, pre-existing 6S RNA levels rapidly declined for about 2 h to ∼30% of that in stationary phase, and then increased over time to their original level in late stationary phase (Fig. 2A). A similar overall accumulation pattern was observed in the Δrbn mutant strain, but in these cells, the reduction of 6S RNA during outgrowth was considerably less pronounced (Fig. 2B), implying that RNase BN participates in the removal of 6S RNA as cells resume growth. These data help to explain why the level of 6S RNA was found to be 2-fold higher in early exponential phase RNase BN− cells when compared with wild type (Table 1). The findings also indicate that RNase BN must be synthesized very rapidly in early exponential phase so that it may be available to participate in the removal of 6S RNA as cells resume growth, a conclusion in complete agreement with the dramatic increase in RNase BN levels shown in Fig. 1B. Although there is some reduction of 6S RNA in the Δrbn cells as well during the first 2 h of growth, we believe that it is likely due to “dilution” of pre-existing 6S RNA that results from the increase in cell number during this period. As shown by the Northern analysis in Fig. 2C, the addition of chloramphenicol at the onset of outgrowth eliminated the reduction in 6S RNA in RNase BN− cells because the antibiotic inhibited cell growth, and hence, there was no dilution effect. 6S RNA was also stabilized in wild type cells in the presence of chloramphenicol because synthesis of RNase BN was blocked, leaving the cell devoid of any RNase BN. The stability of 6S RNA under these conditions suggests that RNase BN is critical for 6S RNA degradation, and that other ribonucleases already present in the cells are unable to catalyze its removal. Additional evidence that RNase BN acts on 6S RNA in vivo comes from an experiment in which the nuclease was overexpressed in wild type cells using a high copy number plasmid. Expression of rbn from this plasmid was driven by an IPTG-inducible promoter. 6S RNA accumulation was detected by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 2D, the normal accumulation of 6S RNA in late exponential and stationary phase was reduced when RNase BN was overexpressed due to IPTG induction. Even in the absence of IPTG, a condition in which RNase BN would be elevated slightly due to leaky expression, there was a slower accumulation of 6S RNA. All of these findings support the conclusion that RNase BN acts on 6S RNA and reduces its level in early exponential phase cells, and then, as RNase BN levels decrease, this enables 6S RNA to accumulate as cells approach and enter stationary phase. To shed further light on the action of RNase BN on 6S RNA, we examined whether RNase BN affects 6S RNA stability. Cells in exponential phase and stationary phase were treated with rifampicin to prevent new 6S RNA synthesis, and 6S RNA levels at different times after rifampicin treatment were determined by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild type exponential phase cells lost about half of their complement of 6S RNA within 20 min after rifampicin treatment, which is in agreement with an earlier work (23.Selinger D.W. Saxena R.M. Cheung K.J. Church G.M. Rosenow C. Global RNA half-life analysis in Escherichia coli reveals positional patterns of transcript degradation.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, 6S RNA in RNase BN− cells was stable for at least 30 min after rifampicin treatment, indicating that the presence of RNase BN led to degradation of 6S RNA. In stationary phase cells, on the other hand, no degradation of 6S RNA was observed in either wild type or Δrbn mutant cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Based on these data, we conclude that RNase BN controls 6S RNA stability in exponential phase cells, and because RNase BN is no longer present in stationary phase cells, 6S RNA is stable irrespective of whether the cells are RNase BN+ or RNase BN−. It should be noted that rifampicin also affects pRNA synthesis, which could alter the actual half-life of 6S RNA seen in this experiment, but not the difference between the two cells. To ascertain whether RNase BN can directly cleave 6S RNA, the RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription and labeled at its 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled 6S RNA was then incubated with purified wild type RNase BN or with an S273A mutant protein that is devoid of RNase activity (10.Dutta T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. How a CCA sequence protects mature tRNAs and tRNA precursors from action of the processing enzyme RNase BN/RNase Z.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 30636-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Treatment with wild type RNase BN in the presence of Mg2+ led to gradual degradation of 6S RNA, generating a 5′-terminal product ∼15 nt in length (Fig. 4A, left panel, and Fig. 4B). Doubling the amount of RNase BN led to a proportional increase in the disappearance of full-length 6S RNA (Fig. 4B), suggesting normal action on the RNA substrate. In contrast, 6S RNA was unaffected by the mutant enzyme (Fig. 4C), confirming that the action on 6S RNA was, in fact, due to RNase BN. Because 5′ labeling only revealed the 5′-terminal fragment generated by RNase BN cleavage, we also carried out primer extension analysis of cleaved 6S RNA using a primer complementary to the 3′-terminal region of 6S RNA to determine whether there might be other cleavages as well. This analysis revealed at least four additional cleavages (supplemental Fig. S2), following residues 140, 127, 92, and ∼70, in addition to the cleavage that generated the ∼15-nt fragment. It should be noted that the cleavage that generates the 15-nt fragment was not observed by primer extension because it is too far from the primer used. Nevertheless, these data show that RNase BN is able to cleave 6S RNA at multiple positions in vitro. Upon outgrowth from stationary phase, 6S RNA is released from RNA polymerase as a 6S RNA:pRNA duplex that is rapidly degraded (14.Cavanagh A.T. Wassarman K.M. 6S RNA, a global regulator of transcription in Escherichia coliBacillus subtilis, and beyond.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether RNase BN also acts on this duplex, 5′ 32P-labeled 6S RNA was annealed with chemically synthesized 14-nt pRNA and then the duplex was treated with purified RNase BN. As shown in Fig. 4A, right panel, RNase BN could cleave the 6S RNA:pRNA duplex, generating two products, one the same size as the product observed when free 6S RNA was cleaved by RNase BN, and a second product ∼43 nt in length. Moreover, RNase BN degraded the 6S RNA:pRNA duplex more efficiently than free 6S RNA (Fig. 4B), indicating that the duplex is a more favorable substrate of RNase BN. We believe that the increased degradation efficiency is due to a rearrangement of 6S RNA structure induced by the binding of pRNA, as described previously (17.Beckmann B.M. Hoch P.G. Marz M. Willkomm D.K. Salas M. Hartmann R.K. A pRNA-induced structural rearrangement triggers 6S-1 RNA release from RNA polymerase in Bacillus subtilis.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNase BN can act as both an exoribonuclease and an endoribonuclease when it functions in the processing of tRNA precursors (9.Dutta T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. Exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease activities of RNase BN/RNase Z both function in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35747-35755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine which activity of RNase BN might contribute to 6S RNA turnover, we performed an in vitro assay using the P142G mutant of RNase BN, which was shown to be devoid of the exoribonuclease activity, while maintaining the endoribonuclease activity (9.Dutta T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. Exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease activities of RNase BN/RNase Z both function in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 35747-35755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the P142G mutant of RNase BN actually degraded 6S RNA more efficiently than the wild type protein, consistent with its increased endoribonuclease activity. Thus, the exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN is not required for its action on 6S RNA in vitro. To determine whether the exoribonuclease activity of RNase BN was also unnecessary in vivo, we compared 6S RNA accumulation in the wild type and in a chromosomal P142G mutant strain using Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, there was no difference in the pattern of 6S RNA degradation and accumulation between the wild type and the P142G mutant strains at different stages of growth, indicating that in vivo RNase BN acts on 6S RNA using primarily its endoribonuclease activity. The data presented here reveal that the amount of RNase BN present in E. coli is regulated by the growth phase of the cells. Thus, RNase BN is present at its highest level in early to mid-exponential phase, decreasing thereafter to the point where it is essentially absent from stationary phase cells. This dramatic growth phase-dependent variation in RNase BN implies that its function may be limited to early exponential growth in E. coli. In fact, the finding that the level of RNase BN rises within 30 min of transfer of cells to new growth medium strongly suggests that it may participate in the transition of cells from stationary to exponential phase, and this conclusion is supported by its action on 6S RNA, a global transcriptional regulator. The mechanism of RNase BN regulation remains unclear, but the fact that rbn mRNA changes in concert with RNase BN protein makes it likely that there is a transcriptional component to the regulation. Moreover, the growth phase-dependent regulation of RNase BN adds to a growing list of bacterial RNases that are known to be regulated in this manner (24.Chen C. Deutscher M.P. RNase R is a highly unstable protein regulated by growth phase and stress.RNA. 2010; 16: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25.Song L. Wang G. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P. Liang W. Reversible acetylation on Lys501 regulates the activity of RNase II.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 1979-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and to the regulation of RNases, in general (1.Deutscher M.P. How bacterial cells keep ribonucleases under control.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2015; 39: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). RNase BN/RNase Z is known to be able to participate in tRNA maturation in E. coli, but this role only becomes obvious when multiple other processing enzymes are absent (11.Kelly K.O. Deutscher M.P. The presence of only one of five exoribonucleases is sufficient to support the growth of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6682-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a condition that only occurs by laboratory manipulation. Thus, the primary physiological function of RNase BN has remained elusive. The findings presented here indicate that RNase BN functions primarily in exponential phase, and that it affects the levels of some sRNAs, such as 6S RNA, SibE, GcvB, and OxyS, and presumably others as well. For further analysis, 6S RNA was used as the model to investigate how RNase BN acts to regulate sRNAs. 6S RNA functions as a global transcription regulator by interacting with Eσ70, but the mechanism that drives its accumulation in stationary phase cells is still unclear (14.Cavanagh A.T. Wassarman K.M. 6S RNA, a global regulator of transcription in Escherichia coliBacillus subtilis, and beyond.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to regulated transcription, degradation or stability control is also thought to be important for the variation in 6S RNA levels that occurs between cells in exponential phase and stationary phase. However, until now, no ribonuclease had been identified as being responsible for 6S RNA degradation, although RNase E, RNase G, and some exoribonucleases were known to participate in the processing of 6S RNA precursors (26.Kim K.S. Lee Y.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2856-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here, we found that RNase BN regulates 6S RNA levels and its stability in vivo. Based on in vitro assays, this regulation appears to be accomplished by direct cleavage of 6S RNA. Additionally, in contrast to its action on tRNA precursors in which both its exoribonuclease and its endoribonuclease activities are involved (9.Dutta T. Malhotra A. Deutscher M.P.

https://openalex.org/W2551216706,"The objective of this study was to develop a discrete event agent-based stochastic model to explore the likelihood of the occurrence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreaks in swine herds with different PRRS control measures in place. The control measures evaluated included vaccination with a modified-live attenuated vaccine and live-virus inoculation of gilts, and both were compared to a baseline scenario where no control measures were in place. A typical North American 1,000-sow farrow-to-wean swine herd was used as a model, with production and disease parameters estimated from the literature and expert opinion. The model constructed herein was not only able to capture individual animal heterogeneity in immunity to and shedding of the PRRS virus, but also the dynamic animal flow and contact structure typical in such herds under field conditions. The model outcomes included maximum number of females infected per simulation, and time at which that happened and the incidence of infected weaned piglets during the first year of challenge-virus introduction. Results showed that the baseline scenario produced a larger percentage of simulations resulting in outbreaks compared to the control scenarios, and interestingly some of the outbreaks occurred over long periods after virus introduction. The live-virus inoculation scenario showed promising results, with fewer simulations resulting in outbreaks than the other scenarios, but the negative impacts of maintaining a PRRS-positive population should be considered. Finally, under the assumptions of the current model, neither of the control strategies prevented the infection from spreading to the piglet population, which highlights the importance of maintaining internal biosecurity practices at the farrowing room level."
https://openalex.org/W2553634225,"Maintaining and improving water quality is key to the protection and restoration of aquatic ecosystems, which provide important benefits to society. In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) defines water quality based on a set of biological, hydro-morphological and chemical targets, and aims to reach good quality conditions in all river bodies by the year 2027. While recently it has been argued that achieving these goals will deliver and enhance ecosystem services, in particular recreational services, there is little empirical evidence demonstrating so. Here we test the hypothesis that good water quality is associated with increased utilization of recreational services, combining four surveys covering walking, boating, fishing and swimming visits, together with water quality data for all water bodies in eight River Basin Districts (RBDs) in England. We compared the percentage of visits in areas of good water quality to a set of null models accounting for population density, income, age distribution, travel distance, public access, and substitutability. We expect such association to be positive, at least for fishing (which relies on fish stocks) and swimming (with direct contact to water). We also test if these services have stronger association with water quality relative to boating and walking alongside rivers, canals or lakeshores. In only two of eight RBDs (Northumbria and Anglian) were both criteria met (positive association, strongest for fishing and swimming) when comparing to at least one of the null models. This conclusion is robust to variations in dataset size. Our study suggests that achieving the WFD water quality goals may not enhance recreational ecosystem services, and calls for further empirical research on the connection between water quality and ecosystem services."

These aberrant fluorescent condensation products, including di-retinoid-pyridinium-ethanolamine (A2E), are thought to be transferred to RPE cells primarily through phagocytosis of the photoreceptor outer segments. However, we observed by two-photon microscopy that mouse retinas incapable of phagocytosis due to a deficiency of the c-Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (Mertk) nonetheless contained fluorescent retinoid condensation material in their RPE. Primary RPE cells from Mertk−/− mice also accumulated fluorescent products in vitro. Finally, quantification of A2E demonstrated the acquisition of retinal condensation products in Mertk−/− mouse RPE prior to retinal degeneration. In these mice, we identified activated microglial cells that likely were recruited to transport A2E-like condensation products to the RPE and dispose of the dying photoreceptor cells. These observations demonstrate a novel transport mechanism between photoreceptor cells and RPE that does not involve canonical Mertk-dependent phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2551781365,"The assembly of one of Nature's most elaborate multienzyme complexes, the cellulosome, results from the binding of enzyme-borne dockerins to reiterated cohesin domains located in a non-catalytic primary scaffoldin. Generally, dockerins present two similar cohesin-binding interfaces that support a dual binding mode. The dynamic integration of enzymes in cellulosomes, afforded by the dual binding mode, is believed to incorporate additional flexibility in highly populated multienzyme complexes. Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the primary degrader of plant structural carbohydrates in the rumen of mammals, uses a portfolio of more than 220 different dockerins to assemble the most intricate cellulosome known to date. A sequence-based analysis organized R. flavefaciens dockerins into six groups. Strikingly, a subset of R. flavefaciens cellulosomal enzymes, comprising dockerins of groups 3 and 6, were shown to be indirectly incorporated into primary scaffoldins via an adaptor scaffoldin termed ScaC. Here, we report the crystal structure of a group 3 R. flavefaciens dockerin, Doc3, in complex with ScaC cohesin. Doc3 is unusual as it presents a large cohesin-interacting surface that lacks the structural symmetry required to support a dual binding mode. In addition, dockerins of groups 3 and 6, which bind exclusively to ScaC cohesin, display a conserved mechanism of protein recognition that is similar to Doc3. Groups 3 and 6 dockerins are predominantly appended to hemicellulose-degrading enzymes. Thus, single binding mode dockerins interacting with adaptor scaffoldins exemplify an evolutionary pathway developed by R. flavefaciens to recruit hemicellulases to the sophisticated cellulosomes acting in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals."

Main cause for this unfavourable outcome is the unphysiological hemodynamic of the Fontan circulation, such as subnormal systemic cardiac output and increased systemic-venous pressure. To overcome this limitation, we are developing the concept of a contractile extracardiac Fontan-tunnel. In this study, we evaluated the survival and structural development of a tissue-engineered conduit under in vivo conditions. Engineered heart tissue was generated from ventricular heart cells of neonatal Wistar rats, fibrinogen and thrombin. Engineered heart tissues started beating around day 8 in vitro and remained contractile in vivo throughout the experiment. After culture for 14 days constructs were implanted around the right superior vena cava of Wistar rats (n = 12). Animals were euthanized after 7, 14, 28 and 56 days postoperatively. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed cardiomyocytes arranged in thick bundles within the engineered heart tissue-conduit. Immunostaining of sarcomeric actin, alpha-actin and connexin 43 revealed a well -developed cardiac myocyte structure. Magnetic resonance imaging (d14, n = 3) revealed no constriction or stenosis of the superior vena cava by the constructs.

The structure of the mixed-holo complex reveals the effects of NAD+ binding on the conformation of the protein. In the ternary complex, the phosphate group of the substrate was bound to the new Pi site in all four subunits.

Here, a β-nitrostyrene derivative, CYT-Rx20, was synthesized and assessed for its anti-cancer activities and underlying mechanism in esophageal cancer. CYT-Rx20 induced cytotoxicity in esophageal cancer cells by promoting apoptosis through activation of caspase cascade and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Besides, CYT-Rx20 inhibited esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. CYT-Rx20 decreased cell viability and migration through suppression of the PI3K/AKT and STAT3 pathways. Of note, the cytotoxicity and anti-migratory effect of CYT-Rx20 were enhanced by co-treatment with SC79 (AKT activator) or colivelin (STAT3 activator), suggesting the dependency of esophageal cancer cells on AKT and STAT3 for survival and migration, an oncogene addiction phenomenon. In xenograft tumor-bearing mice, CYT-Rx20 significantly reduced tumor growth of the implanted esophageal cancer cells accompanied by decreased Ki-67, phospho-AKT, and phospho-STAT3 expression. In orthotopic esophageal cancer mouse model, decreased tumor growth and lung metastasis with reduced Ki-67 and phospho-STAT3 expression were observed in mice treated with CYT-Rx20.

Previous research on men’s judgments of women’s facial attractiveness suggests that men show stronger preferences for feminine characteristics in women’s faces when their own testosterone levels are relatively high. Such results could reflect stronger preferences for high quality mates when mating motivation is strong and/or following success in male-male competition. Given these findings, the current study investigated whether a similar effect of testosterone occurs for men’s preferences for feminine characteristics in women’s voices. Men’s preferences for feminized versus masculinized versions of women’s and men’s voices were assessed in five weekly test sessions and saliva samples were collected in each test session. Analyses showed no relationship between men’s voice preferences and their testosterone levels. Men’s tendency to perceive masculinized men’s and women’s voices as more dominant was also unrelated to their testosterone levels. Together, the results of the current study suggest that testosterone-linked changes in responses to sexually dimorphic characteristics previously reported for men's perceptions of faces do not occur for men's perceptions of voices."

Results demonstrated that the effect of the product labeling on physiological alertness (systolic blood pressure), psychological alertness (self-reported alertness), functional alertness (cognitive interference), and product endorsement was moderated by social influence: participants experienced more subjective, physiological and functional alertness and stronger product endorsement when they consumed the product in the confirming social influence condition than when they consumed the product in the disconfirming social influence condition. These results suggest that social influence can alter subjective, physiological, and functional responses to a faux product, in this case transforming the effects of plain water."

In human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAECs), IFN-α-induced endogenous as well as exogenously expressed MxA was associated with endosomes that aligned alongside microtubules and tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, IFN-α and MxA stimulated basal and BMP4/9 signaling to a Smad1/5/8-responsive pBRE-Luc reporter. In HEK293T cells, immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the association of MxA with endosomes, and immunofluorescence methods showed these to be positive for early endosome markers (early endosomal antigen 1, clathrin light chain and Rab5) and RSmad1/5/8. Functionally, using different genetic and inhibitor approaches, we observed that clathrin-mediated endocytosis enhanced and caveolin-mediated endocytosis inhibited the transcriptional response to BMP4 and BMP9. MxA produced a further 3-4-fold enhancement of the BMP-induced response in a clathrin-endocytosis dependent manner. The microtubule inhibitor nocodazole and stabilizer paclitaxel respectively attenuated and enhanced the effect of MxA, implicating microtubule integrity in this process. MxA enhanced BMP-induced signaling in the presence of wild-type BMPR2, and partially rescued signaling from some PAH-disease-associated BMPR2 mutants. Taken together, the data identify MxA as a novel stimulator of BMP4 and BMP9 transcriptional signaling, and suggest it to be a candidate IFN-α-inducible mechanism that might have a protective role against development of PAH and other vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2553035850,"Here we demonstrate the use of a functional dopant as a fast and simple way to tune the chemical affinity and selectivity of polypyrrole films. More specifically, a boronic-functionalised dopant, 4-N-Pentylphenylboronic Acid (PBA), was used to provide to polypyrrole films with enhanced affinity towards diols. In order to prove the proposed concept, two model systems were explored: (i) the capture and the electrochemical detection of dopamine and (ii) the adhesion of bacteria onto surfaces. The chemisensor, based on overoxidised polypyrrole boronic doped film, was shown to have the ability to capture and retain dopamine, thus improving its detection; furthermore the chemisensor showed better sensitivity in comparison with overoxidised perchlorate doped films. The adhesion of bacteria, Deinococcus proteolyticus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, onto the boric doped polypyrrole film was also tested. The presence of the boronic group in the polypyrrole film was shown to favour the adhesion of sugar-rich bacterial cells when compared with a control film (Dodecyl benzenesulfonate (DBS) doped film) with similar morphological and physical properties. The presented single step synthesis approach is simple and fast, does not require the development and synthesis of functional monomers, and can be easily expanded to the electrochemical, and possibly chemical, fabrication of novel functional surfaces and interfaces with inherent pre-defined sensing and chemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W2556459139,"The standard 26S proteasome is responsible for the majority of myofibrillar protein degradation leading to muscle atrophy. The immunoproteasome is an inducible form of the proteasome. While its function has been linked to conditions of atrophy, its contribution to muscle proteolysis remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the immunoproteasome plays a role in skeletal muscle atrophy induced by denervation. Adult male C57BL/6 wild type (WT) and immunoproteasome knockout lmp7-/-/mecl-1-/- (L7M1) mice underwent tibial nerve transection on the left hindlimb for either 7 or 14 days, while control mice did not undergo surgery. Proteasome activity (caspase-, chymotrypsin-, and trypsin- like), protein content of standard proteasome (β1, β5 and β2) and immunoproteasome (LMP2, LMP7 and MECL-1) catalytic subunits were determined in the gastrocnemius muscle. Denervation induced significant atrophy and was accompanied by increased activities and protein content of the catalytic subunits in both WT and L7M1 mice. Although denervation resulted in a similar degree of muscle atrophy between strains, the mice lacking two immunoproteasome subunits showed a differential response in the extent and duration of proteasome features, including activities and content of the β1, β5 and LMP2 catalytic subunits. The results indicate that immunoproteasome deficiency alters the proteasome’s composition and activities. However, the immunoproteasome does not appear to be essential for muscle atrophy induced by denervation."
https://openalex.org/W2552043506,"Background Although pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (LHD-PH) accounts for the largest proportion of pulmonary hypertension, few reports on the epidemiological analysis of LHD-PH exist. Recently, pulmonary arterial capacitance (PAC) has attracted attention as a possible factor of right ventricular afterload along with pulmonary vascular resistance. We therefore investigated the clinical significance of PAC in LHD-PH. Methods The subject consisted of 252 LHD-PH patients (145 men, mean age 63.4 ± 14.7 years) diagnosed by right heart catheterization. PAC was estimated by the ratio between stroke volume and pulmonary arterial pulse pressure. Patients were classified into four groups according to the PAC (1st quartile was 0.74 to 1.76 ml/mmHg, the 2nd quartile 1.77 to 2.53 ml/mmHg, the 3rd quartile 2.54 to 3.59 ml/mmHg, and the 4th quartile 3.61 to 12.14 ml/mmHg). The end-points were defined as rehospitalization due to worsening heart failure and/or cardiac death. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine what variables were associated with cardiac events. Results The patients in the 1st quartile had the lowest cardiac index and stroke volume index, and the highest mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance compared with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles. Fifty-four patients experienced cardiac events during the follow-up period (median 943 days). The event-free rate of the 1st quartile was significantly lower than that of the 3rd and 4th quartiles (66.7% vs 82.5% [3rd quartile], P = 0.008; and 92.1% [4th quartile], P < 0.001). The Cox hazard analysis revealed that PAC was significantly associated with cardiac events (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.424–0.730, P < 0.001). Conclusion PAC is useful in the prediction of cardiac event risk in LHD-PH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2549941326,"Three species of cranes are distributed widely throughout southern Africa, but little is known about how they respond to the changes in land-use that have occurred in this region. This study assessed habitat preference of the two crane species across land-use categories of the self contained small scale commercial farms of 30 to 40 ha per household (A1), large scale commercial agriculture farms of > 50 ha per household (A2) and Old Resettlement, farms of < 5 ha per household with communal grazing land in Driefontein Grasslands Important Bird Area (IBA), Zimbabwe. The study further explored how selected explanatory (environmental) habitat variables influence crane species abundance. Crane bird counts and data on influencing environmental variables were collected between June and August 2012. Our results show that varying land-use categories had an influence on the abundance and distribution of the Wattled Crane (Bugeranus carunculatus) and the Grey Crowned Crane (Belearica regulorum) across Driefontein Grasslands IBA. The Wattled Crane was widely distributed in the relatively undisturbed A2 farms while the Grey Crowned Crane was associated with the more disturbed land of A1 farms, Old Resettlement and its communal grazing land. Cyperus esculentus and percent (%) bare ground were strong environmental variables best explaining the observed patterns in Wattled Crane abundance across land-use categories. The pattern in Grey Crowned Crane abundance was best explained by soil penetrability, moisture and grass height variables. A holistic sustainable land-use management that takes into account conservation of essential habitats in Driefontein Grasslands IBA is desirable for crane populations and other wetland dependent species that include water birds."

The objectives are to describe the incidence of VT in Denmark during 1997-2011 from national register data, furthermore, to analyze the determinants for VT in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 (COPSAC2010) birth cohort.The incidence of VT in all children under 16 years from 1997-2011 were calculated in the Danish national registries. Determinants of VT were studied in the COPSAC2010 birth cohort of 700 children.Nationwide the prevalence of VT was 24% in children aged 0 to 3 three years, with a significant increase over the study period. For all children 0-15 years, the incidence of VT was 35/1,000. In the VT population, 57% was male and 43% females. In the COPSAC2010 birth cohort, the prevalence of VT during the first 3 years of life was 29%. Determinants of VT were: maternal history of middle ear disease; aHR 2.07, 95% CI [1.45-2.96] and siblings history of middle ear disease; aHR 3.02, [2.11-4.32]. Paternal history of middle ear disease, presence of older siblings in the home and diagnosis of persistent wheeze were significant in the univariate analysis but the association did not persist after adjustment.The incidence of VT is still increasing in the youngest age group in Denmark, demonstrating the highest incidence recorded in the world. Family history of middle ear disease and older siblings are the main determinants for VT."
https://openalex.org/W2555364753,"Overlap between non-coding DNA regulatory sequences and common variant associations can help to identify specific cell and tissue types that are relevant for particular diseases. In a systematic manner, we analyzed variants from 94 genome-wide association studies (reporting at least 12 loci at p<5x10-8) by projecting them onto 466 epigenetic datasets (characterizing DNase I hypersensitive sites; DHSs) derived from various adult and fetal tissue samples and cell lines including many biological replicates. We were able to confirm many expected associations, such as the involvement of specific immune cell types in immune-related diseases and tissue types in diseases that affect specific organs, for example, inflammatory bowel disease and coronary artery disease. Other notable associations include adrenal glands in coronary artery disease, the immune system in Alzheimer's disease, and the kidney for bone marrow density. The association signals for some GWAS (for example, myopia or age at menarche) did not show a clear pattern with any of the cell or tissue types studied. In general, the identified variants from GWAS tend to be located outside coding regions. Altogether, we have performed an extensive characterization of GWAS signals in relation to cell and tissue-specific DHSs, demonstrating a key role for regulatory mechanisms in common diseases and complex traits."

Pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental step in the processing of nascent eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcripts, achieves precise excision of introns coupled with exon ligation to generate functional mRNAs. The spliceosome, which is composed of five U snRNPs 7The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; 5⁁ss, 5⁁ splice site; 3⁁ss, 3⁁ splice site; Pyn, polypyrimidine; nt, nucleotide; ts, temperature-sensitive; CR, conserved region; hPrp18, human Prp18; MBF, MluI binding factor; RP and FP, reverse primer and forward primer, respectively; PDB, Protein Data Bank; EMM, Edinburgh Minimal Medium. and >100 auxiliary proteins, assembles onto cis splicing signals, namely the 5′ splice site (5′ss), the branch point nucleotide, the 3′ splice site (3′ss), and polypyrimidine (Pyn) tracts. The spliceosomal catalytic core consists of the U2, U5, and U6 snRNPs and accessory proteins. This complex mediates the two trans-esterification reactions required for splicing to occur. First, the 5′ss is cleaved to yield the branched lariat intron-exon 2 and exon 1 intermediates, followed by the second reaction, where the 3′ss is cleaved, the exons are joined, and lariat intron is excised (1.Burge C.B.

PRP18, a non-essential budding yeast gene, encodes a U5 snRNP-associated factor. Prp18 has been analyzed extensively in budding yeast and human cell extracts for splicing of a specific model intron containing pre-mRNAs, but the Schizosaccharomyces pombe prp18+ has not been studied in detail. Such studies have the potential to allow mechanistic insights into a genetic model system that better recapitulates splicing of short introns prevalent in several higher eukaryotes. The PRP18 gene is not essential in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and prp18Δ cells are temperature-sensitive (ts) and arrested for the second step of splicing both in vivo and in vitro (10.Vijayraghavan U.

Further analysis of S. cerevisiae Prp18 revealed that an N-terminally truncated Prp18 (ScPrp18Δ79) protein, lacking 79 residues, was functional to mediate splicing in vitro. The crystal structure of this truncated protein revealed a five-helix bundle fold with a highly conserved region (CR) loop between helices 4 and 5 (9.Jiang J. Horowitz D.S. Xu R.M.

Extensive mutational analyses of ScPrp18 identified critical functions for helices 1 and 2 in mediating interactions with the splicing factor ScSlu7. This interaction is important for ScPrp18 spliceosomal association, whereas other regions in its globular domain stabilize U5 snRNA-exonic interactions after the first catalytic reaction (7.Aronova A.

In vitro splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA in HeLa cell free extracts suggests that the human orthologue of Prp18, hPrp18, functions in the second step of splicing (4.Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. A human protein required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing is functionally related to a yeast splicing factor.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but how widely or even strictly this function is conserved in other short intron-rich higher eukaryotic and fungal genomes is not yet clear. When hPrp18 is immunodepleted from HeLa cell extracts, a second step in vitro splicing arrest occurs. However, hPrp18, when expressed in budding yeast scprp18Δ cells, does not rescue their strong ts phenotype, thus suggesting some distinctions in the spliceosomal associations of these orthologs (4.Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. A human protein required for the second step of pre-mRNA splicing is functionally related to a yeast splicing factor.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we exploit the fission yeast system to further define the conserved functions of Prp18 and provide insight into how events in splicing can be coordinated. Salient features of the fission yeast genome include occurrence of multiple short introns per transcript, degenerate cis splicing signals, and unusually located Pyn tracts. These pre-mRNA features, found in many fungal genomes, make it suitable for studies on correlations between cis features and splicing factor requirements (16.Käufer N.F. Potashkin J.

The splicing of short introns in fission yeast is also a model for other higher eukaryotes like plants, flies, and worms, where an intron definition model for splice site recognition is proposed (18.Lim L.P. Burge C.B. A computational analysis of sequence features involved in recognition of short introns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11193-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, earlier studies on the role of intronic 3′ss and the Pyn tract sequences for splicing of two fission yeast introns showed that both of these cis elements are required before the first splicing reaction (19.Romfo C.M. Wise J.A. Both the polypyrimidine tract and the 3′ splice site function prior to the first step of splicing in fission yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4658-4665Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar effects are seen for 3′ss mutations in a subset of mammalian introns (20.Reed R. The organization of 3′ splice-site sequences in mammalian introns.Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2113-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Genetic studies on predicted second step factor homologs in fission yeast are limited to only SpPrp17 and SpSlu7, yet they reveal certain differences when compared with budding yeast counterparts. Deletion of spprp17+, a non-essential gene, did not affect the splicing of introns in the tfIId+ gene, including the 255-nt intron 1 (21.Sapra A.K. Arava Y. Khandelia P. Vijayraghavan U.

Other studies with cwf10-ΔNTE mutant of the SpCwf10 splicing factor revealed that its role in splicing is general and not transcript-specific (25.Livesay S.B. Collier S.E. Bitton D.A. Bähler J.

These studies lend support to the hypothesis of co-evolution of splicing factor functions with changes in gene and intron architecture. These findings warrant investigations on functions for other fission yeast splicing factors. Such studies could uncover mechanisms for splice site selection in the context of short introns. Here, we investigated the splicing functions of the predicted fission yeast second step factor SpPrp18 through structure-driven mutational and genetic approaches. Our results reveal vital roles for the SpPrp18 conserved domain and flanking helices. Genome-wide splicing studies and genetic interaction analyses using a missense mutant show that widespread SpPrp18 functions are in precatalytic spliceosomes, and its essential functions for early steps in splicing are intron-specific.

Richert K. Opitz F. Gross T. Habara Y. Tani T. Käufer N.F.

But how the splicing functions of these factors and cell cycle progression are related is as yet not entirely clear. Here, using a missense mutant in prp18+, we uncover an important role in promoting G1-S cell cycle transition through intron-specific splicing effects of transcripts encoding some key regulators of this transition. The essential S. pombe gene SPCC126.14 encodes SpPrp18, a predicted U5 snRNP-associated protein (33.Kim D.U. Hayles J. Kim D. Wood V. Park H.O. Won M. Yoo H.S. Duhig T. Nam M. Palmer G. Han S.

Prp18 proteins from budding yeast, fission yeast, and humans share a high degree of similarity in their C-terminal halves, which adopt the five-helical bundle with a CR loop between helices 4 and 5 (Fig. 1A). S. pombe SpPrp18 has 35% identity and 58% similarity with ScPrp18 and shows a similar degree of relatedness to hPrp18. A comparison of the domain architecture across these three species revealed the splicing factor motif in the N-terminal region of SpPrp18 and hPrp18 that is absent in ScPrp18 (Fig. 1A). We generated a homology model for amino acids 160–343 of SpPrp18 (Fig. 1B), which shows a five-helix bundle nearly identical to the homologous domain in ScPrp18 (9.Jiang J. Horowitz D.S. Xu R.M.

Horowitz D.S. Mutational analysis identifies two separable roles of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae splicing factor Prp18.RNA. 2002; 8: 1280-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, a triple mutant G196A/V197A/T198A in the CR region or a double mutant K234A/R235E in helix 5 conferred ts phenotypes in budding yeast (13.Bacíková D. Horowitz D.S.

For functional studies of fission yeast SpPrp18, we tested whether substitutions in homologous residues create conditional alleles (Fig. 1B, left). An allele with triple alanine replacements in the SpPrp18 CR domain G288A/V289A/T290A and another with two substitutions in helix 5 (K325A/R326E) were expressed from the nmt42 promoter on a plasmid that also allows the addition of an N-terminal HA epitope. As assessed by a plasmid shuffle assay, both of these mutants are non-functional and cannot support the growth of the spprp18::his3+ null allele (TABLE 1, TABLE 2).TABLE 1List of mutations in homologous residues of SpPrp18 and ScPRP18 and their growth phenotypesPhenotypeResiduePositionMutationS. pombeS. cerevisiaeVal-194Helix 1V194Rts/cs−−288GVT290CRG288A/V289A/T290ANulltsDominant negative325KR326Helix 5K325A/R326ENulltsRecessive Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Complementation profile of SpPrp18 C- and N-terminal mutantsDiploids analyzedNo. of diploids analyzedNo. of spores selected on EMM leu−/25 °CNo. of spores selected on EMM ura−/25 °CNo. of “leak-through” diploids growing on EMM ade− /25 °CNo. of leu+ spores growing on EMM his−/25 °Cspprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP42HA-spprp18+248X2 (96)055spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP41MH-spprp18+248X2 (96)057spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP42HA-spprp18mut (G196A/V197A/T198A)448X2 (96)00spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP42HA-spprp18mut (K234A/R235E)448X2 (96)00spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP41MH-spprp18mut (G288A)296X2 (192)00spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP41MH-spprp18mut (R134A)296X2 (192)0116spprp18::his3+/spprp18+ pREP41MH-spprp18mut (G144A)296X2 (192)098 Open table in a new tab To assess the steady-state expression levels of these mutant proteins, the plasmid-expressed wild-type or mutant proteins were analyzed in wild-type cells. The SpPrp18-G288A/V289A/T290A protein was not detected and thus probably causes aberrant folding and protein turnover (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3, and Table 2). The SpPrp18-K325A/R326E protein, on the other hand, was detected at levels comparable with wild-type SpPrp18 (Fig. 1C, lane 4), yet this protein was unable to complement the spprp18::his3+ null allele (Table 2). Hence, mutational analyses confirmed that the helix 5 and CR regions are crucial for spprp18+ cellular functions. As an alternative approach to obtain conditional mutants in spprp18+, we examined substitutions in a series of residues buried in the α-helical bundle because they could destabilize the protein in a temperature-dependent manner (34.Varadarajan R. Nagarajaram H.A. Ramakrishnan C. A procedure for the prediction of temperature-sensitive mutants of a globular protein based solely on the amino acid sequence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13908-13913Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35.Chakshusmathi G. Mondal K. Lakshmi G.S. Singh G. Roy A. Ch R.B. Madhusudhanan S. Varadarajan R. Design of temperature-sensitive mutants solely from amino acid sequence.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Helices 1 and 2 form one face of this helical bundle, with helix 4 and 5 forming another face, and helix 3 bridges the two faces (Fig. 1B, right). As shown in Fig. 2, we obtained a missense partial loss-of-function allele, spprp18-5, by mutating the valine 194 residue in helix 1 to arginine (V194R). Cells with a plasmid-expressed missense mutant, SpPrp18V194R (nmt81 promoter-driven), were slow growing as compared with a control strain with plasmid-expressed wild-type spprp18+ (data not shown). For stable expression of the WT or prp18-5 alleles, we integrated the expression cassettes at the leu1 chromosomal locus and thus created a set of strains, spprp18Δ leu1::Pnmt:prp18+ (this strain is referred to as WT; Fig. 2A) and spprp18Δ leu1::Pnmt:prp18V194R (referred to as prp18-5; Fig. 2A). In these strains, we achieved conditional expression of the wild-type and mutant spprp18 alleles from the weak nmt81 promoter derived from the nmt1 locus whose transcription is repressed on supplementation of thiamine (36.Maundrell K. nmt1 of fission yeast: a highly transcribed gene completely repressed by thiamine.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WT cells grew robustly on media lacking thiamine (Fig. 2A, left, first row) and, as expected, grow poorly upon the addition of thiamine (Fig. 2A, left, second row). However, the growth of the prp18-5 strain was slow even in medium lacking thiamine at the ambient temperature. Furthermore, this mutant was inviable when expression was repressed by the addition of thiamine (Fig. 2A, right, top two rows). Thus, wild-type protein expressed from the leu1 locus fully complemented the spprp18Δ null allele, but the SpPrp18-5 protein only partially supported growth. As expected, the severe growth arrest of WT and prp18-5 cells on thiamine supplementation was rescued when cells were transformed with a plasmid where spprp18+ is driven by endogenous promoter elements (Fig. 2A, bottom two rows). Immunoblotting was performed to assess the levels of SpPrp18 wild-type and mutant protein expressed in these strains (WT and prp18-5). These strains were grown in the presence and absence of thiamine. Protein levels were compared with the endogenous level of SpPrp18 generated from its native locus (wild type). We detect approximately equivalent protein levels in these strains (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). As expected, the growth retardation of WT and arrest of prp18-5 cells upon the addition of thiamine can be attributed to severely depleted SpPrp18 protein levels (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). Interestingly, immunoblotting analyses of wild-type SpPrp18 protein reveals an additional slower migrating species with ∼3–4-kDa increased size (Fig. 2B, asterisk). This species is also drastically depleted upon supplementation of thiamine to repress expression of the leu1 locus-integrated wild-type allele. We ruled out the possibility that the slower migrating band represents a nonspecific cross-reacting protein because epitope-tagged wild-type SpPrp18, expressed from a plasmid, also generates two protein species of approximately the same molecular weights (Fig. 2C). This led us to speculate that a post-translational modification or altered conformational form of wild-type SpPrp18 could exist. Interestingly, this slow migrating species is absent in prp18-5 cells. To explore the potential structural consequences of substitution of the non-polar (Val) to a charged (Arg) residue for the secondary and tertiary structure of SpPrp18, we examined the biophysical attributes of the bacterially expressed wild-type and mutant proteins. Far UV CD spectra showed negative ellipticity with sharp bands at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of α-helical content of the protein. These are discernable for wild-type SpPrp18 over a range of temperatures from 20 to 90 °C (Fig. 2D, top left). In contrast, the SpPrp18-5 (V194R) protein showed significant change in secondary structure starting at temperatures >40 °C (Fig. 2D, top right), indicating thermal instability probably due to protein unfolding. The native SpPrp18 protein has three tryptophan re"

The rs368234815 IFNL4 polymorphism is related to the previously described IL28B polymorphism, which predicts etiology-independent hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study was to identify the impact of donor and/or recipient IFNL4 genotype on early fibrosis among patients transplanted for hepatitis C (HCV). Methods Clinical data were collected for 302 consecutive patients transplanted for HCV. 116 patients who had available liver biopsies and donor/recipient DNA were included. 28% of these patients with stage 2 fibrosis or greater were compared to patients without significant post-transplant fibrosis with respect to clinical features as well as donor/recipient IFNL4 genotype. Results The IFNL4 TT/TT genotype was found in 26.0% of recipients and 38.6% of donors. Patients who developed early post-transplant fibrosis had a 3.45 adjusted odds of having donor IFNL4 TT/TT genotype (p = 0.012). Donor IFNL4 TT/TT genotype also predicted decreased overall survival compared to non-TT/TT genotypes (p = 0.016). Conclusions Donor IFNL4 TT/TT genotype, a favorable predictor of spontaneous HCV clearance pre-transplant, is associated with increased early post-transplant fibrosis and decreased survival."
https://openalex.org/W2552569839,"The effect of 1-(3-C-ethynyl-β-D-ribo-pentofuranosyl)cytosine (ECyd) on proton-induced cell death was evaluated in human lung carcinoma cell line A549 and Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line V79 to enhance relative biological effectiveness (RBE) within the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) of proton beams. Treatment with ECyd significantly enhanced the proton-induced loss of clonogenicity and increased senescence at the center, but not at the distal edge of SOBP. The p53-binding protein 1 foci formation assay showed that ECyd decelerated the rate of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair at the center, but not the distal region of SOBP, suggesting that the ECyd-induced enhancement of proton-induced cell death is partially associated with the inhibition of DSB repair. This study demonstrated that ECyd enhances proton-induced cell killing at all positions of SOBP, except for the distal region and minimizes the site-dependent differences in RBE within SOBP. Thus, ECyd is a unique radiosensitizer for proton therapy that may be useful because it levels the biological dose within SOBP, which improves tumor control and reduces the risk of adverse effects at the distal edge of SOBP."
https://openalex.org/W2555290060,"Many audio applications perform perception-based time-frequency (TF) analysis by decomposing sounds into a set of functions with good TF localization (i.e. with a small essential support in the TF domain) using TF transforms and applying psychoacoustic models of auditory masking to the transform coefficients. To accurately predict masking interactions between coefficients, the TF properties of the model should match those of the transform. This involves having masking data for stimuli with good TF localization. However, little is known about TF masking for mathematically well-localized signals. Most existing masking studies used stimuli that are broad in time and/or frequency and few studies involved TF conditions. Consequently, the present study had two goals. The first was to collect TF masking data for well-localized stimuli in humans. Masker and target were 10-ms Gaussian-shaped sinusoids with a bandwidth of approximately one critical band. The overall pattern of results is qualitatively similar to existing data for long maskers. To facilitate implementation in audio processing algorithms, a dataset provides the measured TF masking function. The second goal was to assess the potential effect of auditory efferents on TF masking using a modeling approach. The temporal window model of masking was used to predict present and existing data in two configurations: (1) with standard model parameters (i.e. without efferents), (2) with cochlear gain reduction to simulate the activation of efferents. The ability of the model to predict the present data was quite good with the standard configuration but highly degraded with gain reduction. Conversely, the ability of the model to predict existing data for long maskers was better with than without gain reduction. Overall, the model predictions suggest that TF masking can be affected by efferent (or other) effects that reduce cochlear gain. Such effects were avoided in the experiment of this study by using maximally-compact stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2556839163,"In flowering plants, the mature embryo sac consists of seven cells, namely two synergid cells and an egg cell at the micropylar end, one central cell, and three antipodal cells at the chalazal end. Excluding the antipodal cell, as a model for the study of cell fate determination and cell type specification, the roles of these embryo sac component cells in fertilization and seed formation have been widely investigated. At this time, little is known regarding the function of antipodal cells and their cell type-specific gene expression patterns. One reason for this is difficulties related to the observation and isolation of cells for detailed functional analyses. Here, we report a method for antipodal cell isolation and transcriptome analysis. We identified antipodal cell-specific marker line K44-1, and based on this marker line, established a procedure allowing us to isolate antipodal cells with both high quality and quantity. PCR validation of antipodal-specific genes from antipodal cell cDNA showed that the isolated cells are qualified and can be used for transcriptome analysis and screening of cell type-specific marker genes. The isolated cells could keep viable for a week in culture condition. This method can be used to efficiently isolate antipodal cells of high quality and will promote the functional investigation of antipodal cells in Arabidopsis thaliana. This increases our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanism of antipodal cell specification."
https://openalex.org/W2551721881,"Profile Hidden Markov Model (Profile-HMM) is an efficient statistical approach to represent protein families. Currently, several databases maintain valuable protein sequence information as profile-HMMs. There is an increasing interest to improve the efficiency of searching Profile-HMM databases to detect sequence-profile or profile-profile homology. However, most efforts to enhance searching efficiency have been focusing on improving the alignment algorithms. Although the performance of these algorithms is fairly acceptable, the growing size of these databases, as well as the increasing demand for using batch query searching approach, are strong motivations that call for further enhancement of information retrieval from profile-HMM databases. This work presents a heuristic method to accelerate the current profile-HMM homology searching approaches. The method works by cluster-based remodeling of the database to reduce the search space, rather than focusing on the alignment algorithms. Using different clustering techniques, 4284 TIGRFAMs profiles were clustered based on their similarities. A representative for each cluster was assigned. To enhance sensitivity, we proposed an extended step that allows overlapping among clusters. A validation benchmark of 6000 randomly selected protein sequences was used to query the clustered profiles. To evaluate the efficiency of our approach, speed and recall values were measured and compared with the sequential search approach. Using hierarchical, k-means, and connected component clustering techniques followed by the extended overlapping step, we obtained an average reduction in time of 41%, and an average recall of 96%. Our results demonstrate that representation of profile-HMMs using a clustering-based approach can significantly accelerate data retrieval from profile-HMM databases."
