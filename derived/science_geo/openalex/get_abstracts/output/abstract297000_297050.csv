https://openalex.org/W2118877639,"It is proposed that differences in plant height and productivity of the salt-marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora are the result of a dynamic interaction among tidal water movement, dissolved iron and sulfide concentrations in marsh soils, and bacterial sulfate reduction. Tidal water movement regulates the input of iron into marsh soils and the drainage of sulfide-containing interstitial water, and thereby controls the concentration of dissolved sulfide formed as a result of bacterial sulfate reduction. Near tidal creeks, where water movement and plant height and production are greatest, sulfide concentrations are lowest; in more elevated regions of marsh, where water movement and plant production are least, sulfide concentrations are highest. Plant height and productivity may be limited by the effects of sulfide on nutrient uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2024712957,Evidence is presented demonstrating that associative learning during oviposition in Crataegus or apple hosts can significantly influence the propensity of apple maggot flies to accept or reject these hosts in future encounters. The data suggest that within resource patches of a given host type there may be an enhancement of foraging efficiency.
https://openalex.org/W1966486231,Africanized and European honey bee (Apis mellifera) populations showed quantitative differences in colony defensive behavior. Africanized bees responded faster and in much larger numbers than European honey bees and produced 8.2 and 5.9 times as many stings during two different experiments. Times to react to alarming stimuli were negatively correlated with the number of bees responding and to the total number of stings. The number of bees responding was significantly correlated to the total number of stings only for the Africanized population.

https://openalex.org/W2036780682,"A new crysallographic technique has been developed, which has been applied to the problem of locating the cations in a natural olivine crystal with the composition (Mg(0.90)Fe(0.10)Ni(0.004)Mn(0.002))(2)SiO(4). The method uses the variation of characteristic x-ray emission with the direction of an exciting electron beam in an analytical transmission electron microscope. It may be applied to nanometer-sized areas and to concentrations as low as 0.1 atomic percent, is capable of distinguishing neighbors in the periodic table, and does not require external standards. The iron atoms in this crystal are evenly distributed between the two available crystal sites M1 and M2 (49.6 +/- 1 percent on M1), whereas the trace elements nickel and manganese occupy the M1 and M2 positions, respectively (97 +/- 5 percent nickel on M1 and 1 +/- 5 percent manganese on M1)."
https://openalex.org/W1994558246,"Radiocarbon analyses and stable isotope measurements are presented foro recent cores of banded corals from the Florida Straits. These values provide a record of variations in the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface waters of the Gulf Stream from A.D. 1642 to 1800. An increase in the carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio of 7 per mil for coral growth during the early 1700's was most likely induced by an increase in the carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio of 20 per mil in the atmospheric carbon dioxide that occurred at about 1700. The ratios of oxygen 18 to oxygen-16 in these coral bands show a small decrease of a water temperature ( approximately 1 degrees C) during the latter part of the Little Ice Age (1700 to 1725). These results support the hypothesis that the increase in atmospheric carbon-14 at about 1700, and possibly the temperature change as well, was caused by a decrease in solar activity (Maunder sunspot minimum)."
https://openalex.org/W1968998919,A laboratory strain of Drosophila mercatorum has existed for 20 years without males and therefore without natural selection operating to maintain the genetic basis of female mating behavior. The females of this strain have recently experienced a genetic impairment of mating capacity. This observation exemplifies the mode of evolution of vestigial characters and supports Muller's theory that random mutation will tend to destroy the genetic basis of a character from which selection has been removed.

https://openalex.org/W2066560758,"The aging of simulated nuclear waste glass by contact with a controlled-temperature, humid atmosphere results in the formation of a double hydration layer penetrating into the glass and in the formation of minerals on the glass surface. The hydration process described here provides insight into the aging kinetics of naturally occurring glasses and also suggests that simulated aging reactions are necessary for demonstrating that nuclear waste forms can meet projected Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements."

https://openalex.org/W2089679654,"A xenophyophore found just below the surface of a box core of modern deep-sea sediment from the Japan Trench has a threadlike plasma body that extends through horizontal, anastomosing networks of organically bound sediment tubes (the organism's test). The tubes resemble somne of the polygonal networks of the trace fossil Paleodictyon. Such xenophyophores may be the makers of Paleodictyon, and the complex, regular geometry of Paleodictyon may be determined by the xenophyophore's anastomosing body shape."

https://openalex.org/W1999573778,"The level of the plasma prothrombin in the circulating blood is decreased during its passage through the pulmonary capillaries. In 85 per cent. of samples, plasma prothrombin has been found to be less in the blood of the left ventricle than in that from the right ventricle. This difference averaged 10.6 per cent. and ranged from 4 to 19 per cent. In no instance was the level in the right ventricle lower than that in the left. In samples of blood taken from the arterial and venous supply of the head, liver, spleen, intestine, kidney and hind limbs, no significant difference in plasma prothrombin levels was found. A possible explanation of this role of the lung in the loss of plasma prothrombin is thought to be the production of blood platelets in this organ, as demonstrated by Howell and Donahue. Platelets, as they undergo disintegration, initiate the first stage of the clotting process by releasing thromboplastin, which, in the presence of calcium, changes prothrombin to thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2045145415,"Eggs of demersal spawning coral-reef fishes of the tropical western Atlantic are smaller than those of related species in the western Pacific. Decreased egg volume may result in increased fecundity per unit body weight of Atlantic species, a factor that may underlie apparent differences in the stability of the respective coral-reef fish communities."

https://openalex.org/W2048223333,"The Reagan administration policy on nuclear energy is viewed as it relates to fuel reprocessing and to the administration's desire to bring the Barnwell, SC plant on-stream. The proliferation issue as it relates to reprocessing is countered with the claim that activation of Barnwell for reprocessing would significantly reduce current problems with high-level radioactive wastes, since such wastes are converted by reprocessing into a form more readily disposable. Many of the current economic, political, and technological uncertainties surrounding reprocessing, particularly as they would relate to the Barnwell facility, are explored. Incentives which are necessary to interest private industry in fuel reprocessing either now or in the future are explored. Various points raised in a report originating at Argonne National Laboratory concerning the technological aspects of Barnwell are aired with opposing remarks by Shelby Brown, DOE Assistant Secretary for nuclear energy.
