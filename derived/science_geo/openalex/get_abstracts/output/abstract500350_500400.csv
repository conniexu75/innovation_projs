Keranen et al. show that the steep rise in earthquakes in Oklahoma, USA, is likely caused by fluid migration from wastewater disposal wells. Twenty percent of the earthquakes in the central United States could be attributed to just four of the wells. Injected fluids in high-volume wells triggered earthquakes over 30 km away.

Astronomers often attribute periodic shifts in a star's apparent motion toward and away from us to the tug of orbiting planets. Robertson et al. studied archival spectra of the star Gliese 581 to assess another potential cause: magnetic activity on the star's surface. The signals once attributed to two planet candidates instead resulted from the combined effect of starspots and stellar rotation.

https://openalex.org/W2010985903,"Background and Objectives Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is an integral feature of neurological disorders and involves the action of multiple proinflammatory cytokines on the microvascular endothelial cells lining cerebral capillaries. There is still however, considerable ambiguity throughout the scientific literature regarding the mechanistic role(s) of cytokines in this context, thereby warranting a comprehensive in vitro investigation into how different cytokines may cause dysregulation of adherens and tight junctions leading to BBB permeabilization. Methods The present study employs human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMvECs) to compare/contrast the effects of TNF-α and IL-6 on BBB characteristics ranging from the expression of interendothelial junction proteins (VE-cadherin, occludin and claudin-5) to endothelial monolayer permeability. The contribution of cytokine-induced NADPH oxidase activation to altered barrier phenotype was also investigated. Results In response to treatment with either TNF-α or IL-6 (0–100 ng/ml, 0–24 hrs), our studies consistently demonstrated significant dose- and time-dependent decreases in the expression of all interendothelial junction proteins examined, in parallel with dose- and time-dependent increases in ROS generation and HBMvEC permeability. Increased expression and co-association of gp91 and p47, pivotal NADPH oxidase subunits, was also observed in response to either cytokine. Finally, cytokine-dependent effects on junctional protein expression, ROS generation and endothelial permeability could all be attenuated to a comparable extent using a range of antioxidant strategies, which included ROS depleting agents (superoxide dismutase, catalase, N-acetylcysteine, apocynin) and targeted NADPH oxidase blockade (gp91 and p47 siRNA, NSC23766). Conclusion A timely and wide-ranging investigation comparing the permeabilizing actions of TNF-α and IL-6 in HBMvECs is presented, in which we demonstrate how either cytokine can similarly downregulate the expression of interendothelial adherens and tight junction proteins leading to elevation of paracellular permeability. The cytokine-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase leading to ROS generation was also confirmed to be responsible in-part for these events."
https://openalex.org/W2039057576,"The loss of microRNA-122 (miR-122) expression is strongly associated with increased invasion and metastasis, and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that miR-122 over-expression in HCC cell lines Sk-hep-1 and Bel-7402 triggered the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), as demonstrated by epithelial-like morphological changes, up-regulated epithelial proteins (E-cadherin, ZO-1, α-catenin, occludin, BVES, and MST4), and down-regulated mesenchymal proteins (vimentin and fibronectin). The over-expression of miRNA-122 also caused cytoskeleton disruption, RhoA/Rock pathway inactivation, enhanced cell adhesion, and suppression of migration and invasion of Sk-hep-1 and Bel-7402 cells, whereas, these effects could be reversed through miR-122 inhibition. Additional studies demonstrated that the inhibition of wild-type RhoA function induced MET and inhibited cell migration and invasion, while RhoA over-expression reversed miR-122-induced MET and inhibition of migration and invasion of HCC cells, suggesting that miR-122 induced MET and suppressed the migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting RhoA. Moreover, our results demonstrated that HNF4α up-regulated its target gene miR-122 that subsequently induced MET and inhibited cell migration and invasion, whereas miR-122 inhibition reversed these HNF4α-induced phenotypes. These results revealed functional and mechanistic links among the tumor suppressors HNF4α, miR-122, and RhoA in EMT and invasive and metastatic phenotypes of HCC. Taken together, our study provides the first evidence that the HNF4α/miR-122/RhoA axis negatively regulates EMT and the migration and invasion of HCC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056779555,"Skin barrier disruption and dermal inflammation are key phenotypes of atopic dermatitis (AD). Staphylococcus aureus secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are involved in AD pathogenesis. Here, we evaluated the role of EVs-associated α-hemolysin derived from S. aureus in AD pathogenesis. α-hemolysin production from S. aureus was detected using western blot analyses. The cytotoxic activity of α-hemolysin on HaCaT keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring cell viability after treating cells with soluble and EVs-associated α-hemolysin. To determine the type of cell death, HaCaT keratinocytes were stained with annexin V and 7-AAD. The in vivo effects of α-hemolysin were evaluated by application of soluble and EV-associated α-hemolysin on the mouse skin. The present study showed that increased α-hemolysin was produced by S. aureus colonized on AD patients compared to healthy subjects. α-hemolysin production was also related to AD severity. In addition, EV-associated α-hemolysin was more cytotoxic to HaCaT keratinocytes than soluble α-hemolysin, and α-hemolysin-negative EVs did not induce keratinocyte death. EV-associated α-hemolysin induced necrosis, but soluble α-hemolysin induced apoptosis of keratinocytes. In vivo, skin barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia were induced by soluble and EV-associated α-hemolysin. However, AD-like dermal inflammation was only caused by EV-associated α-hemolysin. Moreover, neither skin barrier disruption nor AD-like skin inflammation was induced by α-hemolysin-negative EVs. Taken together, α-Hemolysin secreted from S. aureus, particularly the EV-associated form, induces both skin barrier disruption and AD-like skin inflammation, suggesting that EV-associated α-hemolysin is a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for the control of AD."
https://openalex.org/W1964176057,"Aim The current study had two aims. The primary purpose was to examine the association between serum vitamin D levels and the ergometric evaluation of muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and speed in professional soccer players. The secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of the soccer off-season period on serum vitamin D levels. Methods Sixty-seven Caucasian male soccer players (age 25.6±6.2 and height 1.81±0.08 m), members of two Greek Superleague Soccer teams and one Football-league championship team participated in this study. Exercise performance testing for the determination of squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), 10 (10 m) and 20 meters (20 m) sprint performance, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), anthropometry, and blood sampling were performed before (pre) and after (post) the six-week off-season period. Results Analysis of our results showed the following: (a) a significant correlations between serum vitamin D levels and performance parameters in both pre (SJ; P<0.001, CMJ; P<0.001, VO2max; P<0.001, 10 m; P<0.001, and 20 m; P<0.001) and post (SJ; P<0.001, CMJ; P<0.001, VO2max; P = 0.006, 10 m; P<0.001, and 20 m; P<0.001) experimental sessions. (b) Vitamin D concentration increased significantly (P<0.001) following the six-week off-season period compared to baseline, while at the same time all measured performance parameters decreased (SJ; P<0.001, CMJ; P<0.001, 10 m; P<0.001, 20 m; P<0.001, VO2max; P<0.001). Discussion Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels are associated with the ergometric evaluation of muscle strength, as expressed by SJ and CMJ, sprinting capacity, and VO2max in professional soccer players, irrespective the levels of performance. Furthermore, our data reaffirm the importance of UVB on serum vitamin D levels. Moreover, reductions in exercise training stress may also have beneficial effects on vitamin D levels, suggesting a possible association of its levels and the training-induced stress. Our results indicate a possibly bidirectional interaction between soccer performance indices and vitamin D levels."
https://openalex.org/W2002636258,"Rapid tumor growth can establish metabolically stressed microenvironments that activate 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a ubiquitous regulator of ATP homeostasis. Previously, we investigated the importance of AMPK for the growth of experimental tumors prepared from HRAS-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts and for primary brain tumor development in a rat model of neurocarcinogenesis. Here, we used triple-negative human breast cancer cells in which AMPK activity had been knocked down to investigate the contribution of AMPK to experimental tumor growth and core glucose metabolism. We found that AMPK supports the growth of fast-growing orthotopic tumors prepared from MDA-MB-231 and DU4475 breast cancer cells but had no effect on the proliferation or survival of these cells in culture. We used in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiling with [13C]glucose tracers to investigate the contribution of AMPK to core glucose metabolism in MDA-MB-231 cells, which have a Warburg metabolic phenotype; these experiments indicated that AMPK supports tumor glucose metabolism in part through positive regulation of glycolysis and the nonoxidative pentose phosphate cycle. We also found that AMPK activity in the MDA-MB-231 tumors could systemically perturb glucose homeostasis in sensitive normal tissues (liver and pancreas). Overall, our findings suggest that the contribution of AMPK to the growth of aggressive experimental tumors has a critical microenvironmental component that involves specific regulation of core glucose metabolism.

Both inherent (cell autonomous) and microenvironmental influences favor the emergence of metabolism in tumor cells that is fundamentally different from that in most normal cells (1.Vander Heiden M.G.

Perhaps the most commonly observed inherent metabolic phenotype of tumor cells is the Warburg effect, in which glucose is consumed by glycolysis with substantial lactate production even in the presence of abundant oxygen (aerobic glycolysis) (1.Vander Heiden M.G.

The Warburg effect is considered an important mechanism by which tumor cells divert glucose flux from catabolism by oxidative phosphorylation to anabolism (biomass production), thus supporting cellular growth and proliferation at the cost of efficient ATP production. At the tissue level, the growth of solid tumors commonly generates regions of nutrient or metabolic stress (e.g. hypoxia, glucose deprivation, and acidification); tumor cells in these regions may exhibit a microenvironmental Warburg-like effect (2.Schulze A.

We found that KD of AMPK activity in these cells generated the same in vivo and in vitro phenotypes as KO of AMPK activity in HRAS G12V-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, i.e. poor growth as tumors in nude mice, but no significant effect on the proliferation or survival of the same cells under nutrient-rich culture conditions. We confirmed these two AMPKα1/2 KD phenotypes by using a different TN human breast cancer cell line (DU4475 cells). Because MDA-MB-231 cells have a documented Warburg effect (12.Robey I.F. Stephen R.M. Brown K.S. Baggett B.K. Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Regulation of the Warburg effect in early passage breast cancer cells.Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we used these cells for metabolic profiling with 13C-labeled d-glucose (glucose) to investigate the contribution of AMPK to core glucose metabolism both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (orthotopic tumors). We found that glucose utilization in AMPKα1/2 KD compared with control MDA-MB-231 tumors resembled a non-Warburg metabolic phenotype; importantly, this in vivo phenotype retained specific AMPK-dependent effects on core glucose metabolism detected by in vitro metabolic profiling of the same cells. Finally, we observed AMPK-dependent effects of MDA-MB-231 tumor burden on glucose metabolism in normal liver and pancreas, which indicated a systemic interaction between tumor- and glucose-responsive normal tissues. Overall, our findings suggest the general hypothesis that AMPK could support the growth and core glucose metabolism of aggressive human tumors containing metabolically stressed microenvironments. Goat polyclonal anti-AMPKα1 and -α2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; catalog nos. sc-19128 and sc-19131, respectively). The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology: an AMPKα1/2 (AMPKα) antibody (catalog no. 2532S); an acetyl-CoA carboxylase antibody (catalog no. 3662S); and a phospho-Ser-79 acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 antibody (3661L). A lentivirus preparation containing shRNAs for targeting human AMPKα1/2 expression was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (AMPKα1/2 shRNA (h) Lentiviral Particles; catalog no. sc-45312-V). The lentivirus preparation consists of pools of three target-specific constructs that encode 28 nucleotide (plus hairpin) shRNAs for each of the AMPKα1 and -α2 mRNAs (PRKAA1/2 mRNAs).

Cells were infected with the lentivirus preparation described above to generate shRNA control and AMPKα1/2 KD cell lines. Cells at ∼50% confluency in a 24-well culture plate were exposed to lentivirus particles in complete medium containing Polybrene (5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. sc-134220); cells were typically infected at multiplicity of infection values of 10 or 40. Infected cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air overnight, and the medium was replaced with complete medium for another overnight incubation. The medium was replaced with selection medium (containing 2 μg/ml puromycin; Invitrogen), and the selection medium was replaced every 3–4 days until resistant colonies appeared. Pooled colonies were expanded, and cells were cryopreserved or used immediately for experiments (culture medium was supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin). The extent of AMPKα1/2 KD in each cell line was monitored by immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR analyses; if changes in the extent of KD were detected with time in culture (passaging), early passage cells were obtained from frozen stocks for subsequent experiments. Culture dishes or plates were placed on ice or on cold packs, and the medium was removed. Cells were lysed by adding ≤200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid (EMD/Millipore Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany), 50 units benzonase nuclease (EMD/Millipore), 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture III, PIC III (EMD/Millipore)). After spinning at 9,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Equal protein samples (typically 10–15 μg) were resolved in 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE BisTris Gels, Invitrogen) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-FL membranes (EMD/Millipore). Blots were blocked in a 1:1 mixture of Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NB) and PBS, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. For protein detection, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody typically diluted 1:1,000 in Odyssey Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature containing a species-specific IRDye 800-conjugated IgG antibody (LI-COR Biosciences) diluted (e.g. 1:10,000) in Odyssey Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% SDS. Primary antibody binding was detected and visualized by using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). SeeBlue Plus 2 prestained standards (Invitrogen) were used to calibrate the immunoblots. Total RNA was collected and purified by using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the supplier's instructions. First strand (cDNA) synthesis and qPCR were performed by using an RT2 first strand kit and an RT2 SYBER Green qPCR master mix kit from SABiosciences/Qiagen. Amplicons from the human AMPKα1/2 subunit gene mRNAs (PRKAA1 and PRKAA2) were generated with the following primer sets (RT2 qPCR primer assays, SABiosciences/Qiagen): PRKAA1, catalog no. PPH00043B (110-bp amplicon; located at position 1,537 in RefSeq sequence NM_006251) and PRKAA2, catalog no. PPH15207A (141-bp amplicon; located at position 1,530 in RefSeq sequence NM_006252). The amplicons were generated by using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) with the following thermocycling program: denaturation, 95 °C, 10 min; amplification, 95 °C, 15 s; annealing, 60 °C, 1 min; 45 cycles. In vivo procedures were approved by the SRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). To investigate tumor growth, orthotopic tumors were initiated by injecting shRNA control or AMPKα1/2 KD cells (3 × 106 cells/cell line) in 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) into the right mammary fat pad (lower mammary papilla) of female nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Livermore, CA). When the tumors reached a uniform mean volume (∼100 mm3), mice were separated into shRNA control and AMPKα1/2 KD groups (10–15 mice/group). Tumor growth was monitored daily, and tumor volumes were measured twice weekly (tumor volumes were calculated using the formula V = L × W × H × π/6, where L and W represent the longer and shorter diameters of the tumor, and H represents the height of the tumor (16.Tomayko M.M. Reynolds C.P. Determination of subcutaneous tumor size in athymic (nude) mice.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1989; 24: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar)). Analysis of tumor growth, including statistical comparisons between groups of mice, was performed using the Study Director package (Studylog Systems, Inc., South San Francisco) and GraphPad Prism/InStat (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). One-way analysis of variance with a Tukey-Cramer post hoc test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences between the mean volumes of corresponding shRNA and AMPKα1/2 KD tumors; p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference between the mean tumor volumes of two groups. To investigate tumor metabolism, orthotopic tumors were prepared by injecting two groups of 30 mice each with shRNA control or AMPKα1/2 KD MDA-MB-231 cells. When the faster growing shRNA control tumors reached a mean volume of ∼400 mm3, metabolic profiling was performed using 13C-labeled glucose, as described below.

Distinct lung-colonizing and lung-metastasizing cell populations in B16 mouse melanoma.Nature. 1981; 289: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was performed by injecting shRNA control or AMPKα1/2 KD MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 106 cells/tail vein injection, suspended in serum-free medium; day 0) into groups of beige nude mice (Harlan Laboratories; 15 mice/group). The statistical significance of the survival data were evaluated by using the log-rank test. The distribution of the injected cells and the occurrence of tumors were monitored on day 0 and day 1, and then weekly for 10 weeks by bioluminescence imaging using an IVIS Lumina XR System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Caliper), according to the vendor's instructions. As mentioned above, the MDA-MB-231 cells constitutively express a luciferase reporter. Briefly, no later than 15 min before imaging, mice were injected i.p. with d-luciferin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Caliper) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS; without calcium and magnesium; Invitrogen) at 150 mg/kg/ml. Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) during imaging. Image analysis was performed with Living Image software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Caliper), and bioluminescent signals were quantified as average signals (photon counts/s/cm2) for comparisons between individual mice. Steady-state glucose uptake by cultured cells was measured essentially as described previously (18.Lin Z. Weinberg J.M. Malhotra R. Merritt S.E. Holzman L.B. Brosius 3rd, F.C.

Cells were plated in 2 ml of medium in the wells of 6-well cell culture plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C until they were ≤90% confluent. The cells were washed at least three times with D-PBS containing calcium and magnesium, and then 1 ml/well of D-PBS labeling solution was added (2 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (PerkinElmer Life Sciences catalog no. NET549A250UC; 25–50 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml), 0.1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose (Sigma, catalog no. D3179), 1% BSA; ±20 μm cytochalasin B (CB; Sigma, catalog no. C6762). The active glucose uptake inhibitor CB was used to control for passive diffusion of glucose into cells. Cells were incubated in the labeling solution at 37 °C for 10 min, and then they were placed on ice, and 1 ml/well of ice-cold D-PBS containing 110 μg/ml phloretin was added to stop active glucose uptake. Cells were washed three times with D-PBS containing 55 μg/ml phloretin and lysed by scraping in 0.3 ml/well of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were spun at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and protein concentrations were measured using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific). The radioactivities of the lysates were determined by counting 200 μl of each lysate in 4.5 ml of scintillation fluid, and the counts for lysates from CB-treated cells were subtracted from the counts for lysates from cells not treated with CB. Glucose uptake data were expressed as picomoles/mg of protein/5 min. Steady-state l-glutamine (glutamine) uptake by cultured cells was measured by using l-[3,4-3H]Glutamine ([3H]glutamine; PerkinElmer Life Sciences; catalog no. NET551001MC; 30–60 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) as a tracer, essentially as described in Ref. 20.Wise D.R. DeBerardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M.

Cells were plated in 1 ml of medium in the wells of a 24-well cell culture plate (1.0 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C until they were ≤90% confluent. The medium was replaced with medium containing 2 mm normal glutamine and 5 μCi of [3H]glutamine, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The plate was placed on ice, and the wells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS and air-dried for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed by adding 210 μl/well of a solution of 0.2 n NaOH and 0.2% SDS, followed by the addition of 10 μl/well of 2 n HCl. The protein concentrations of the lysates were measured using a BCA assay, and radioactivity measurements were made by counting 150 μl of each lysate in 4.5 ml of scintillation fluid. Glutamine uptake data were expressed as counts/min/mg total protein. Cells were plated in the wells of 96-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well; XF96 plates, Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The next day, the medium was changed to XF Assay Medium (Seahorse Bioscience) containing 25 mm glucose, 1 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine or containing 1 mm glucose, 0.05 mm pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Steady-state (baseline) oxygen consumption rates and extracellular acidification rates were measured with an XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Addition of 2.5 μm oligomycin was used to evaluate the glycolytic response of the cells by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation; addition of 5 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone was used to evaluate the maximal respiratory response of the cells (21.Wu M.

To investigate glucose metabolism in shRNA control and AMPKα1/2 KD MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro, subconfluent cultures of both genotypes (100-mm diameter culture plates; three replicates/cell line) were incubated with d-[1,2-13C2]glucose (called [13C2]glucose below; Sigma, catalog no. 661422-1G; 99 atom % 13C) in glucose- and pyruvate-free DMEM (Sigma, catalog no. D5030). Cells were incubated in either high glucose medium (DMEM + 10% FBS; 25 mm glucose composed of 50% normal glucose and 50% [13C2]glucose) or low glucose medium (DMEM + 10% FBS; 1 mm glucose composed of 50% normal glucose and 50% [13C2]glucose) for 48 h, with one change of medium at 24 h. Cells were placed on ice; the medium was removed and frozen at −80 °C; cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS; and cell pellets were prepared by trypsinization (pellets were stored at −80 °C). To investigate glucose metabolism in orthotopic tumors prepared from shRNA control and AMPKα1/2 KD MDA-MB-231 cells, mice were injected i.p. (1 g/kg) with [13C6]glucose (d-[13C6]glucose, Sigma, catalog no. 389374-2G; 99 atom % 13C) dissolved in sterile PBS (0.25 g/ml glucose; 50% [13C6]glucose/normal glucose). Blood samples were collected at 30, 60, and 90 min after completion of the glucose injections (blood was collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min; the plasma was stored at −80 °C). Mice used to collect blood at each time point were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (60–80 mg/kg). Tumor, pancreas, and liver were immediately removed from each mouse; flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at −80 °C. CO2 was obtained from culture medium (100 μl) or tissue (≤100 mg) by adding an equal volume of 0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1 n HCl to a sample in a gas chromatography (GC) vial, followed immediately by analysis of the head space gas by mass spectrometry (GC-MS; see below for details). 12/13CO2 isotopomers were monitored at m/z 44 and 45 in the electron impact ionization (EI) spectrum to determine the fraction of [12/13C]glucose ([13C2]glucose or [13C6]glucose) that was completely oxidized by the pentose phosphate cycle (PPC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, relative to 12CO2 from the β-oxidation of (unlabeled) fatty acids (23.Boros L.G.

https://openalex.org/W2001787659,"The Stroop and stop-signal tasks are commonly used to index prepotent response inhibition in studies of cognitive development and individual differences. Inhibitory measures from the two tasks have been derived using a variety of methods. Findings of low inter-correlations amongst these measures have been interpreted as evidence for different kinds of inhibitory functions. Our previous study found Stroop and stop-signal accuracy measures to be uncorrelated and they loaded on different inhibitory components in a principal component analysis. The present study examined whether this finding is replicated across different task contexts, derived measures, and methods of derivation. Adolescents (N = 247) were administered a number-quantity Stroop and word and number stop-signal tasks. For each stop-signal task, inhibitory efficiency was estimated using a stop-signal reaction time measure estimated with the central versus the integration methods. For the Stroop interference task, inhibitory efficiency was indexed by reaction time measures (including inverse efficiency scores) generated from difference scores and regression residuals, and delta-plot slopes. The reaction time measures from the two tasks were generally not correlated. The only exception was that Stroop inhibitory ability, indexed by Stroop errors, was related to stop-signal inhibitory efficiency, indexed by stop-signal reaction time. These findings are consistent with previous findings suggesting that measures from the Stroop and stop-signal tasks are influenced by different underlying processes. The impact of variations in dependent measure derivation on the resulting reliabilities of Stroop and stop-signal measures and on observed correlations between them were examined. Variables that may have contributed to the null findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2039040796,"Objectives Hypertension is one of the major cardiovascular diseases. It affects nearly 1.56 billion people worldwide. The present study is about a particular genetic polymorphism (A1166C), gene expression and protein expression of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) (SNP ID: rs5186) and its association with essential hypertension in a Northern Indian population. Methods We analyzed the A1166C polymorphism and expression of AT1R gene in 250 patients with essential hypertension and 250 normal healthy controls. Results A significant association was found in the AT1R genotypes (AC+CC) with essential hypertension (χ2 = 22.48, p = 0.0001). Individuals with CC genotypes were at 2.4 times higher odds (p = 0.0001) to develop essential hypertension than individuals with AC and AA genotypes. The statistically significant intergenotypic variation in the systolic blood pressure was found higher in the patients with CC (169.4±36.3 mmHg) as compared to that of AA (143.5±28.1 mmHg) and AC (153.9±30.5 mmHg) genotypes (p = 0.0001). We found a significant difference in the average delta-CT value (p = 0.0001) wherein an upregulated gene expression (approximately 16 fold) was observed in case of patients as compared to controls. Furthermore, higher expression of AT1R gene was observed in patients with CC genotype than with AC and AA genotypes. A significant difference (p = 0.0001) in the protein expression of angiotensin II Type 1 receptor was also observed in the plasma of patients (1.49±0.27) as compared to controls (0.80±0.24). Conclusion Our findings suggest that C allele of A1166C polymorphism in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene is associated with essential hypertension and its upregulation could play an important role in essential hypertension."

Design and Methods A prospective longitudinal study using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health Sibling Pairs (n = 1,303). Obesity phenotypes were measured from anthropometric assessments when study members were aged 18–26 and again when they were 24–32. Genetic risk scores were computed based on published genome-wide association study discoveries for obesity. Analyses tested genetic associations with body-mass index (BMI), waist-height ratio, obesity, and change in BMI over time. Results White and black young adults with higher genetic risk scores had higher BMI and waist-height ratio and were more likely to be obese compared to lower genetic risk age-peers. Sibling analyses revealed that the genetic risk score was predictive of BMI net of risk factors shared by siblings. In white young adults only, higher genetic risk predicted increased risk of becoming obese during the study period. In black young adults, genetic risk scores constructed using loci identified in European and African American samples had similar predictive power. Conclusion Cumulative information across the human genome can be used to characterize individual level risk for obesity. Measured genetic risk accounts for only a small amount of total variation in BMI among white and black young adults. Future research is needed to identify modifiable environmental exposures that amplify or mitigate genetic risk for elevated BMI."

The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of ALK rearrangements in a large cohort of patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma and to analyze the association of ALK rearrangements with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes. The roles of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Ventana immunohistochemistry (IHC), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the detection of ALK rearrangements were evaluated. The ALK rearrangement was detected in 430 specimens from individual patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma using FISH and Ventana IHC based on tissue microarrays. The EGFR status was detected in all of the specimens through DNA sequencing. An RT-PCR was performed on 200 of the specimens and confirmed by sequencing. Of the 430 patients, 46 (10.7%) harbored ALK rearrangements. The ALK rearrangements were associated with a younger age and the EGFR wild type in comparison with ALK-negative patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the Ventana IHC were 100% and 98.2%, respectively, and the concordance rate between the FISH and the Ventana IHC was 98.4%. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR were 95.5% and 87.0%, respectively, and the concordance rate between the FISH and the RT-PCR was 89.0%. The Cox analysis indicated that an early stage and EGFR-activating mutations were independently associated with a longer OS. This study demonstrated that ALK rearrangements are associated with a younger age and the EGFR wild type rather than with other clinicopathological factors. Although the FISH and Ventana IHC have better concordance, and RT-PCR is a more sensitive method and can identify different variants or partners, the IHC and RT-PCR need to be further evaluated in clinical trials to identify their roles in guiding patients’ targeted therapy using crizotinib."

Zwintz et al. confirm theoretical predictions that the frequency of the seismic oscillations in a given star is tied to its evolutionary status (see the Perspective by Stahler and Palla). As the protostar evolves and contracts, growing hotter and denser, it pulsates faster. Though previously applied only to aging stars, asteroseismology now offers a powerful tool for discerning the ages of very young stars. The relative timing of star formation within young clusters especially benefits from this refinement, as stars there are often tagged with one blanket age.

Currently it is not clear which Dvl residues are phosphorylated and what is the consequence of individual phosphorylation events. In the present study we employed mass spectrometry to analyze in a comprehensive way the phosphorylation of human Dvl3 induced by CK1ϵ. Our analysis revealed >50 phosphorylation sites on Dvl3; only a minority of these sites was found dynamically induced after co-expression of CK1ϵ, and surprisingly, phosphorylation of one cluster of modified residues was down-regulated. Dynamically phosphorylated sites were analyzed functionally. Mutations within PDZ domain (S280A and S311A) reduced the ability of Dvl3 to activate TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor)-driven transcription and induce secondary axis in Xenopus embryos. In contrast, mutations of clustered Ser/Thr in the Dvl3 C terminus prevented ability of CK1ϵ to induce electrophoretic mobility shift of Dvl3 and its even subcellular localization. Surprisingly, mobility shift and subcellular localization changes induced by Fzd5, a Wnt receptor, were in all these mutants indistinguishable from wild type Dvl3. In summary, our data on the molecular level (i) support previous the assumption that CK1ϵ acts via phosphorylation of distinct residues as the activator as well as the shut-off signal of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and (ii) suggest that CK1ϵ acts on Dvl via different mechanism than Fzd5.

https://openalex.org/W2009397926,"The starch debranching enzymes isoamylase 1 and 2 (ISA1 and ISA2) are known to exist in a large complex and are involved in the biosynthesis and crystallization of starch. It is suggested that the function of the complex is to remove misplaced branches of growing amylopectin molecules, which would otherwise prevent the association and crystallization of adjacent linear chains. Here, we investigate the function of ISA1 and ISA2 from starch producing alga Chlamydomonas. Through complementation studies, we confirm that the STA8 locus encodes for ISA2 and sta8 mutants lack the ISA1·ISA2 heteromeric complex. However, mutants retain a functional dimeric ISA1 that is able to partly sustain starch synthesis in vivo. To better characterize ISA1, we have overexpressed and purified ISA1 from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrISA1) and solved the crystal structure to 2.3 Å and in complex with maltoheptaose to 2.4 Å. Analysis of the homodimeric CrISA1 structure reveals a unique elongated structure with monomers connected end-to-end. The crystal complex reveals details about the mechanism of branch binding that explains the low activity of CrISA1 toward tightly spaced branches and reveals the presence of additional secondary surface carbohydrate binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2014874593,"UDP sugars were identified as extracellular signaling molecules, assigning a new function to these compounds in addition to their well defined role in intracellular substrate metabolism and storage. Previously regarded as an orphan receptor, the G protein-coupled receptor P2Y14 (GPR105) was found to bind extracellular UDP and UDP sugars. Little is known about the physiological functions of this G protein-coupled receptor. To study its physiological role, we used a gene-deficient mouse strain expressing the bacterial LacZ reporter gene to monitor the physiological expression pattern of P2Y14. We found that P2Y14 is mainly expressed in pancreas and salivary glands and in subpopulations of smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, lung, and uterus. Among other phenotypical differences, knock-out mice showed a significantly impaired glucose tolerance following oral and intraperitoneal glucose application. An unchanged insulin tolerance suggested altered pancreatic islet function. Transcriptome analysis of pancreatic islets showed that P2Y14 deficiency significantly changed expression of components involved in insulin secretion. Insulin secretion tests revealed a reduced insulin release from P2Y14-deficient islets, highlighting P2Y14 as a new modulator of proper insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2159665548,"One strategy for isolating or eliciting antibodies against a specific target region on the envelope glycoprotein trimer (Env) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involves the creation of site transplants, which present the target region on a heterologous protein scaffold with preserved antibody-binding properties. If the target region is a supersite of HIV-1 vulnerability, recognized by a collection of broadly neutralizing antibodies, this strategy affords the creation of ""supersite transplants"", capable of binding (and potentially eliciting) antibodies similar to the template collection of effective antibodies. Here we transplant three supersites of HIV-1 vulnerability, each targeted by effective neutralizing antibodies from multiple donors. To implement our strategy, we chose a single representative antibody against each of the target supersites: antibody 10E8, which recognizes the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) on the HIV-1 gp41 glycoprotein; antibody PG9, which recognizes variable regions one and two (V1V2) on the HIV-1 gp120 glycoprotein; and antibody PGT128 which recognizes a glycopeptide supersite in variable region 3 (glycan V3) on gp120. We used a structural alignment algorithm to identify suitable acceptor proteins, and then designed, expressed, and tested antigenically over 100-supersite transplants in a 96-well microtiter-plate format. The majority of the supersite transplants failed to maintain the antigenic properties of their respective template supersite. However, seven of the glycan V3-supersite transplants exhibited nanomolar affinity to effective neutralizing antibodies from at least three donors and recapitulated the mannose9-N-linked glycan requirement of the template supersite. The binding of these transplants could be further enhanced by placement into self-assembling nanoparticles. Essential elements of the glycan V3 supersite, embodied by as few as 3 N-linked glycans and ∼ 25 Env residues, can be segregated into acceptor scaffolds away from the immune-evading capabilities of the rest of HIV-1 Env, thereby providing a means to focus the immune response on the scaffolded supersite."
https://openalex.org/W2093984947,"A number of scientific papers in the last few years singled out the influence of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of fish species, highlighting the need for the fisheries scientific community to investigate, besides biomass estimates, also the habitat selection of commercially important fish species. The Mediterranean Sea, although generally oligotrophic, is characterized by high habitat variability and represents an ideal study area to investigate the adaptive behavior of small pelagics under different environmental conditions. In this study the habitat selection of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and European sardine Sardina pilchardus is analyzed in two areas of the Mediterranean Sea that largely differentiate in terms of environmental regimes: the Strait of Sicily and the North Aegean Sea. A number of environmental parameters were used to investigate factors influencing anchovy and sardine habitat selection. Acoustic surveys data, collected during the summer period 2002–2010, were used for this purpose. The quotient analysis was used to identify the association between high density values and environmental variables; it was applied to the entire dataset in each area in order to identify similarities or differences in the “mean” spatial behavioral pattern for each species. Principal component analysis was applied to selected environmental variables in order to identify those environmental regimes which drive each of the two ecosystems. The analysis revealed the effect of food availability along with bottom depth selection on the spatial distribution of both species. Furthermore PCA results highlighted that observed selectivity for shallower waters is mainly associated to specific environmental processes that locally increase productivity. The common trends in habitat selection of the two species, as observed in the two regions although they present marked differences in hydrodynamics, seem to be driven by the oligotrophic character of the study areas, highlighting the role of areas where the local environmental regimes meet ‘the ocean triad hypothesis’."
https://openalex.org/W1986342032,"A hallmark of early IVD degeneration is a decrease in proteoglycan content. Progression will eventually lead to matrix degradation, a decrease in weight bearing capacity and loss of disc height. In the final stages of IVD degradation, fissures appear in the annular ring allowing extrusion of the NP. It is crucial to understand the interplay between mechanobiology, disc composition and metabolism to be able to provide exercise recommendations to patients with early signs of disc degeneration. This study evaluates the effect of physiological loading compared to no loading on matrix homeostasis in bovine discs with induced degeneration. Bovine discs with trypsin-induced degeneration were cultured for 14 days in a bioreactor under dynamic loading with maintained metabolic activity. Chondroadherin abundance and structure was used to confirm that a functional matrix was preserved in the chosen loading environment. No change was observed in chondroadherin integrity and a non-significant increase in abundance was detected in trypsin-treated loaded discs compared to unloaded discs. The proteoglycan concentration in loaded trypsin-treated discs was significantly higher than in unloaded disc and the newly synthesised proteoglycans were of the same size range as those found in control samples. The proteoglycan showed an even distribution throughout the NP region, similar to that of control discs. Significantly more newly synthesised type II collagen was detected in trypsin-treated loaded discs compared to unloaded discs, demonstrating that physiological load not only stimulates aggrecan production, but also that of type II collagen. Taken together, this study shows that dynamic physiological load has the ability to repair the extracellular matrix depletion typical of early disc degeneration."

The possible importance of ischemic injuries in causing neurological deficits after brain tumor surgery is not much studied. We aimed to study the volume and frequency of early postoperative circulatory changes (i.e. infarctions) detected by diffusion weighted resonance imaging (DWI) in patients with surgically acquired neurological deficits compared to controls.We designed a 1 ∶ 1 matched case-control study in patients with diffuse gliomas (WHO grade II-IV) operated with 3D ultrasound guided resection. 42 consecutive patients with acquired postoperative dysphasia and/or new motor deficits were compared to 42 matched controls without acquired deficits. Controls were matched with respect to histopathology, preoperative tumor volumes, and eloquence of location. Two independent radiologists blinded for clinical status assessed the postoperative DWI findings.Postoperative peri-tumoral infarctions were more often seen in patients with acquired deficits (63% versus 41%, p = 0.046) and volumes of DWI abnormalities were larger in cases than in controls with median 1.08 cm3 (IQR 0-2.39) versus median 0 cm3 (IQR 0-1.67), p = 0.047. Inter-rater agreement was substantial (67/82, κ = 0.64, p<0.001) for diagnosing radiological significant DWI abnormalities.Peri-tumoral infarctions were more common and were larger in patients with acquired deficits after glioma surgery compared to glioma patients without deficits when assessed by early postoperative DWI. Infarctions may be a frequent and underestimated cause of acquired deficits after glioma resection. DWI changes may be an attractive endpoint in brain tumor surgery with both good inter-rater reliability among radiologists and clinical relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2000001576,"Acute pancreatitis is a serious and sometimes fatal inflammatory disease where the pancreas digests itself. The non-oxidative ethanol metabolites palmitoleic acid (POA) and POA-ethylester (POAEE) are reported to induce pancreatitis caused by impaired mitochondrial metabolism, cytosolic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) overload and necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells. Metabolism and [Ca(2+)]i are linked critically by the ATP-driven plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) important for maintaining low resting [Ca(2+)]i. The aim of the current study was to test the protective effects of insulin on cellular injury induced by the pancreatitis-inducing agents, ethanol, POA, and POAEE. Rat pancreatic acinar cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and [Ca(2+)]i was measured by fura-2 imaging. An in situ [Ca(2+)]i clearance assay was used to assess PMCA activity. Magnesium green (MgGreen) and a luciferase-based ATP kit were used to assess cellular ATP depletion. Ethanol (100 mM) and POAEE (100 μM) induced a small but irreversible Ca(2+) overload response but had no significant effect on PMCA activity. POA (50-100 μM) induced a robust Ca(2+) overload, ATP depletion, inhibited PMCA activity, and consequently induced necrosis. Insulin pretreatment (100 nm for 30 min) prevented the POA-induced Ca(2+) overload, ATP depletion, inhibition of the PMCA, and necrosis. Moreover, the insulin-mediated protection of the POA-induced Ca(2+) overload was partially prevented by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002.

https://openalex.org/W2010114503,"LsbB is a class II leaderless lactococcal bacteriocin of 30 amino acids. In the present work, the structure and function relationship of LsbB was assessed. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy showed that LsbB has an N-terminal α-helix, whereas the C-terminal of the molecule remains unstructured. To define the receptor binding domain of LsbB, a competition assay was performed in which a systematic collection of truncated peptides of various lengths covering different parts of LsbB was used to inhibit the antimicrobial activity of LsbB. The results indicate that the outmost eight-amino acid sequence at the C-terminal end is likely to contain the receptor binding domain because only truncated fragments from this region could antagonize the antimicrobial activity of LsbB. Furthermore, alanine substitution revealed that the tryptophan in position 25 (Trp(25)) is crucial for the blocking activity of the truncated peptides, as well as for the antimicrobial activity of the full-length bacteriocin. LsbB shares significant sequence homology with five other leaderless bacteriocins, especially at their C-terminal halves where all contain a conserved KXXXGXXPWE motif, suggesting that they might recognize the same receptor as LsbB. This notion was supported by the fact that truncated peptides with sequences derived from the C-terminal regions of two LsbB-related bacteriocins inhibited the activity of LsbB, in the same manner as found with the truncated version of LsbB. Taken together, these structure-function studies provide strong evidence that the receptor-binding parts of LsbB and sequence-related bacteriocins are located in their C-terminal halves."
https://openalex.org/W2004691988,"Overexpression of EGFR is responsible for causing a number of cancers, including lung cancer as it activates various downstream signaling pathways. Thus, it is important to control EGFR function in order to treat the cancer patients. It is well established that inhibiting ATP binding within the EGFR kinase domain regulates its function. The existing quinazoline derivative based drugs used for treating lung cancer that inhibits the wild type of EGFR. In this study, we have made a systematic attempt to develop QSAR models for designing quinazoline derivatives that could inhibit wild EGFR and imidazothiazoles/pyrazolopyrimidines derivatives against mutant EGFR. In this study, three types of prediction methods have been developed to design inhibitors against EGFR (wild, mutant and both). First, we developed models for predicting inhibitors against wild type EGFR by training and testing on dataset containing 128 quinazoline based inhibitors. This dataset was divided into two subsets called wild_train and wild_valid containing 103 and 25 inhibitors respectively. The models were trained and tested on wild_train dataset while performance was evaluated on the wild_valid called validation dataset. We achieved a maximum correlation between predicted and experimentally determined inhibition (IC50) of 0.90 on validation dataset. Secondly, we developed models for predicting inhibitors against mutant EGFR (L858R) on mutant_train, and mutant_valid dataset and achieved a maximum correlation between 0.834 to 0.850 on these datasets. Finally, an integrated hybrid model has been developed on a dataset containing wild and mutant inhibitors and got maximum correlation between 0.761 to 0.850 on different datasets. In order to promote open source drug discovery, we developed a webserver for designing inhibitors against wild and mutant EGFR along with providing standalone (http://osddlinux.osdd.net/) and Galaxy (http://osddlinux.osdd.net:8001) version of software. We hope our webserver (http://crdd.osdd.net/oscadd/ntegfr/) will play a vital role in designing new anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2086879787,"β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). BACE1 is elevated ∼2–3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is Aβ−dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by Aβ might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2α phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2α phosphorylation on Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2α phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5′ untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2α translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2α-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation did not block Aβ-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2α phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2α phosphorylation in Aβ-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein Aβ42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated Aβ production and plaque progression."
https://openalex.org/W2130106540,"Diagenetic distortion can be a major obstacle to collecting quantitative shape data on paleontological specimens, especially for three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis. Here we utilize the recently-published algorithmic symmetrization method of fossil reconstruction and compare it to the more traditional reflection & averaging approach. In order to have an objective test of this method, five casts of a female cranium of Papio hamadryas kindae were manually deformed while the plaster hardened. These were subsequently ""retrodeformed"" using both algorithmic symmetrization and reflection & averaging and then compared to the original, undeformed specimen. We found that in all cases, algorithmic retrodeformation improved the shape of the deformed cranium and in four out of five cases, the algorithmically symmetrized crania were more similar in shape to the original crania than the reflected & averaged reconstructions. In three out of five cases, the difference between the algorithmically symmetrized crania and the original cranium could be contained within the magnitude of variation among individuals in a single subspecies of Papio. Instances of asymmetric distortion, such as breakage on one side, or bending in the axis of symmetry, were well handled, whereas symmetrical distortion remained uncorrected. This technique was further tested on a naturally deformed and fossilized cranium of Paradolichopithecus arvernensis. Results, based on a principal components analysis and Procrustes distances, showed that the algorithmically symmetrized Paradolichopithecus cranium was more similar to other, less-deformed crania from the same species than was the original. These results illustrate the efficacy of this method of retrodeformation by algorithmic symmetrization for the correction of asymmetrical distortion in fossils. Symmetrical distortion remains a problem for all currently developed methods of retrodeformation."
https://openalex.org/W2011043243,"Hepatic steatosis, characterized by ectopic hepatic triglyceride accumulation, is considered as the early manifestation of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Increased SREBP-1c level and activity contribute to excessive hepatic triglyceride accumulation in NAFLD patients; however, negative regulators of Srebp-1c are not well defined. In this study, we show that Dec1, a critical regulator of circadian rhythm, negatively regulates hepatic Srebp-1c expression. Hepatic Dec1 expression levels are markedly decreased in NAFLD mouse models. Restored Dec1 gene expression levels in NAFLD mouse livers decreased the expression of Srebp-1c and lipogenic genes, subsequently ameliorating the fatty liver phenotype. Conversely, knockdown of Dec1 expression by an adenovirus expressing Dec1-specific shRNA led to an increase in hepatic TG content in normal mouse livers. Correspondingly, expression levels of lipogenic genes, including Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc, were increased in livers of mice with Dec1 knockdown. Moreover, a functional lipogenesis assay suggested that Dec1 overexpression repressed lipid synthesis in primary hepatocytes. Finally, a luciferase reporter gene assay indicates that DEC1 inhibits Srebp-1c gene transcription via the E-box mapped to the promoter region. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that DEC1 proteins bound to the identified E-box element.

Dec1 (differentiated embryo chondrocyte 1; also known as BHLHB2, STRA13, or SHARP2), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family, is known as a critical regulator of the circadian rhythm (14.Honma S.

Dec1 and Dec2 are regulators of the mammalian molecular clock.Nature. 2002; 419: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It exhibits a circadian expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and various peripheral tissues and regulates circadian rhythm via suppressing the CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated activation of key components of the circadian clock system, including Per1 (14.Honma S.

Circadian rhythm has been demonstrated to control various physiological processes, including energy and metabolic homeostasis. Dec1 has been shown to be involved in adipogenesis.

In addition, nuclear receptor LXRs and RORα also activate Dec1 expression through direct binding to its promoter region (17.Noshiro M. Usui E. Kawamoto T. Sato F. Nakashima A. Ueshima T. Honda K.

In the present study, we show that Dec1 acts as a repressor of hepatic lipogenesis. Activation of Dec1 in obese mouse livers decreased the expression levels of lipogenic genes, including Srebp-1c and its target genes, subsequently alleviating the nonalcoholic fatty liver phenotype. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J, Leprdb/+ (db/m), and Leprdb/db (db/db) mice and 10-week-old Lepob/ob (ob/ob) mice were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China) and housed and maintained in 12-h light and dark photoperiods. The mouse protocol was approved by the Animal Research Committee in the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, and conformed to criteria outlined in the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. For adenovirus treatment, mice were injected with purified adenovirus with 1.0 × 109 active viral particles in 150 μl of 0.4% NaCl solution via tail vein. Then, 5–7 days later, mice fasted for 6 h were sacrificed, and their livers and serum were collected for analysis. The full-length mouse Dec1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from C57BL/6J mouse liver cDNA using the following primer pair: 5′-ATGGAACGGATCCCCAGCG-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-TTAGTCTTTGGTTTCTAAGTTTAAA-3′ as a reverse primer. A FLAG tag was added at the C terminus of Dec1 cDNA with restriction enzyme sites by using the forward primer 5′-AGATCTCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGATGGAACGGATCCCCAGCG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-AAGCTTTTAGTCTTTGGTTTCTAAGTTTAAA-3′. Then it was constructed into pcDNA3.1 and pAd-Track-CMV vector with the same restriction sites. For RNA interference application, the DNA sequences corresponding with the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences of 5′-GATCTCCGCACGTGAAAGCATTGACATTCAAGAGATGTCAATGCTTTCACGTGCTTTTT-3′ (top) and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGCACGTGAAAGCATTGACATCTCTTGAATGTCAATGCTTTCACGTGCGG-3′(bottom), which are against Dec1, were constructed into pAd-Track-U6 vector. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and purified by the cesium chloride method. As a negative control, a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing a scrambled shRNA (shScram) was generated as well. Adenovirus was purified by the cesium chloride method and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol. Primary mouse hepatocytes were obtained from the livers of male C57BL/6J mice. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized, and their livers were perfused with 0.5 mg/ml type II collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) via the inferior vena cava to isolate hepatocytes. Mouse hepatocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin for further study. ChIP assays were performed as described previously (19.Choi S.M. Cho H.-J. Cho H. Kim K.H. Kim J.B. Park H.

Briefly, the tissue or cells were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and resuspended in 200 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)). Lysates were sonicated and then diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), and 167 mm NaCl). The diluted lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-DEC1 (Sigma) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or normal mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitates were washed and then eluted with 300 ml of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and reversed. The promoter region of Srebp-1c was amplified by PCR using the following primer pair: 5′-GATTGGCCATGTGCGCTCA-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CTGGCAAAGTAATAGAGTG-3′ as a reverse primer. Total RNA was isolated from cells or pulverized liver using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized using random primers and the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad IQ5. The mRNA abundance of various transcripts was measured using the Q-PCR SYBR Green kits (Promega). All gene expression data were normalized to β-actin expression levels. All gene expression experiments were performed in at least three independent runs, each performed in triplicate.

Briefly, overnight-fasted mice were injected with 500 mg/kg body weight of tyloxapol via tail vein. Blood samples were collected by tail bleeding at several time points for serum triglyceride measurement. The rate of lipogenesis in hepatocytes was measured as described previously (21.Sheng L.

Briefly, primary hepatocytes were isolated and treated with the indicated adenovirus and subsequently exposed to 5 μm TO901317 for 48 h. The cells were then incubated for additional 4 h in Williams Medium E (Sigma) supplemented with 4 μCi/ml [3H]acetate (PerkinElmer), 0.5 mm unlabeled acetate, and 0.5% BSA. Lipids were extracted from cell lysate with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic phase was first dried by evaporation at 50 °C and then dissolved with 50 μl of hexane and 200 μl of 1.8% H2SO4 in methanol and heated at 100 °C for 30 min. 125 μl of water was added to the mixtures, and they were extracted with 250 μl of petroleum. The petroleum phase was collected for measurement of 3H radioactivity. Hepatocyte lipogenesis rates were normalized to cell protein levels. The assays were performed as described previously (21.Sheng L. Cho K.W. Zhou Y. Shen H. Rui L.

Primary hepatocytes infected with the indicated adenovirus were incubated with 0.4 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]oleic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 100 μm unlabeled oleic acid (conjugated with BSA) in Krebs-Ringer buffer (119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.6 mm MgSO4, 24.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.6 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were collected and incubated with 1.3 m perchloric acid. All the solutions were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were neutralized with 2 m KOH, 0.6 m MOPS. 3 ml of scintillation liquid was then added, and [3H]radioactivity was measured. Chow-fed ob/ob and C57BL/6J mice were housed in a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle and fed ad libitum a regular chow diet. Mice were sacrificed at 16:00 (Zeitgeber time 8 during light phase). Total RNA was prepared from each liver using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Equal aliquots of total RNA from each of four mouse livers in each group were pooled and used for biotin labeling as described in the Affymetrix technical bulletin. Then the transcriptional profiles of samples were probed using the Gene-Chip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). Significance analysis of microarrays was used to identify differences between different samples (22.Zhang S. A comprehensive evaluation of SAM, the SAM R-package and a simple modification to improve its performance.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Gene Ontology (GO) classification was performed with the DAVID tool (23.Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (25338) Google Scholar). Data were processed for the heat maps with cluster analysis (24.Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Cluster analysis and display of genome-wide expression patterns.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Data are presented as means ± S.D. and were compared between or among groups by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test or by a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher least significant difference test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To identify novel transcriptional factors involved in dysfunctional hepatic lipid homeostasis in obesity, we performed mRNA microarray analysis of livers of ob/ob mice, a widely used obese model, and C57BL/6J control mice (the data sets have been submitted to the ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MTAB-2678). Preliminary microarray data revealed that many genes known to be involved in metabolism and circadian rhythm display a change of at least 2-fold, of which 42 genes, 20 genes, and 18 genes are involved in lipid metabolism (including transcriptional factor SREBF1 (also known as SREBP-1) and its downstream target genes SCD-1 and Fasn (also known as Fas)), glucose metabolism (including G6pc and Pck1 (also known as Pepck1)), and rhythmic processes (including Per1 and Cry1) respectively (Fig. 1, A–C). A real-time PCR assay verified the decreased mRNA levels of Dec1 in livers of ob/ob mice compared with C57BL/6J control mice (Fig. 1D). We also observed a similar decrease in hepatic Dec1 expression in other NAFLD mouse models, including db/db mice (Fig. 1E) and high-fat diet-induced obese mice (Fig. 1F). Correspondingly, DEC1 protein levels were also decreased in the livers of these mice, as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1G). All of the NAFLD mice exhibited a high level of hepatic triglyceride content. These data suggest that Dec1 may be involved in hepatic dysfunctional lipid metabolism. Dec1 is a clock gene with rhythmic expression in liver and other peripheral tissues of wild-type mice. We next measured its expression levels in db/db diabetic and db/m control mouse livers at different Zeitgeber time (ZT) points (ZT0, light on; ZT12, light off). Our data indicate that Dec1 also exhibits a rhythmic expression pattern in these mouse livers. In db/m mice, Dec1 levels rose in the light cycle and peaked at ZT8 (16:00). However, in db/db mice, its expression mildly fluctuated (Fig. 1H). Hepatic steatosis is characterized with excessive TG accumulation (4.Ferré P. Foufelle F. Hepatic steatosis: a role for de novo lipogenesis and the transcription factor SREBP-1c.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2010; 12: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that hepatic Dec1 deficiency contributed to fatty liver disease progress in these obese mice. To test this hypothesis, we generated recombinant adenovirus expressing DEC1-FLAG fusion protein (Ad-DEC1) and performed genetic constitution experiments in NAFLD mice, including db/db mice and ob/ob mice. Ad-DEC1 and the control adenovirus (Ad-GFP), which expresses GFP only, were infused into mice via tail vein. Ad-DEC1 efficiently expressed the exogenous DEC1-FLAG fusion protein in mouse livers. Consequently, histological analysis, Oil red O staining (Fig. 2A), and H&E staining (Fig. 2B) suggested that Ad-DEC1 treatment markedly ameliorated the fatty liver phenotype in db/db mice. In Ad-DEC1-infected db/db mice, oil drop size in hepatocytes became smaller, and hepatic tissues showed increased density compared with that in Ad-GFP-infected db/db mice. Gross morphological changes showed that the liver of Ad-DEC1-infected db/db mice appeared fresh red and smaller in size compared with the mice injected with Ad-GFP (Fig. 2C). Biochemical analysis indicated that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Dec1 significantly reduced hepatic (Fig. 2D, top) and serum triglyceride levels (Fig. 2D, bottom). However, the hepatic and serum cholesterol levels remained unchanged (Table 2), indicating that Dec1 specifically regulated TG metabolism. Additionally, hepatic overexpression of Dec1 did not significantly affect mouse body weight (Table 2).TABLE 2Metabolic characteristics of NAFLD mice (db/db and ob/ob mice) treated with adenovirus containing exogenous Dec1 (Ad-DEC1) and Ad-GFP for 6 days or normal mice (C57/BL6J) treated with Dec1-specific shRNA (Ad-shDEC1) and Ad-shScram for 7 days.

Open table in a new tab We also injected Ad-DEC1 into ob/ob mice. Similar results were obtained as that in db/db mice. Overexpression of Dec1 alleviated the fatty liver phenotype in ob/ob mice as well (Fig. 2, E–G). Biochemical analysis also confirmed that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Dec1 significantly reduced hepatic and serum triglyceride levels (Fig. 2H). Again, adenovirus Ad-DEC1 treatment did not markedly change hepatic or serum cholesterol contents (Table 2). To further confirm the inhibitory effects of Dec1 on hepatic TG contents and test whether Dec1 deficiency in normal mice liver could affect hepatic TG accumulation, we generated an adenovirus expressing Dec1-specific shRNA (Ad-shDEC1). Preliminary data indicated that this adenovirus could effectively knock down endogenous Dec1 gene expression in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3A). Next, we injected Ad-shDEC1 into C57BL/6J normal mice via tail vein. As a result, Ad-shDEC1-infected C57 mice showed increased hepatic (Fig. 3B) and serum (Fig. 3C) triglyceride content compared with Ad-shScram-infected control mice. However, Ad-shDEC1 treatment of C57BL/6J mice did not significantly influence body weight or hepatic cholesterol contents (Table 2). Theoretically, a decrease in the hepatic TG could be caused by increased VLDL secretion, fatty acid oxidation, or decreased TG synthesis or lipid uptake. We measured some key genes involved in these physiological processes, including Pparα, Mcad, and Cpt1 (fatty acid oxidation), Cd36 (fatty acid uptake), and Mttp and ApoB (VLDL secretion). We did not observe significant changes in expression levels of these genes (data not shown). A hepatic VLDL secretion assay also confirmed that Dec1 overexpression did not influence this physiological process in db/db or ob/ob mice (Fig. 4A). In addition, adenovirus-mediated activation of Dec1 did not affect fatty acid β-oxidation in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 4B). However, our data suggested that overexpression of Dec1 effectively repressed Srebp-1c expression in livers of db/db (Fig. 4C) and ob/ob mice (Fig. 4D). In addition, expression levels of Fas and Acc were also decreased in Ad-DEC1-infected db/db (Fig. 4E) and ob/ob mouse livers (Fig. 4F). Consistent with these effects, Ad-DEC1 treatment of primary hepatocytes decreased the rate of lipogenesis compared with Ad-GFP treatment (Fig. 4G). In contrast, Ad-shDEC1 adenovirus efficiently silenced endogenous Dec1 mRNA expression levels in C57 mouse livers compared with the control Ad-shScram adenovirus (Fig. 4H). As expected, knockdown of Dec1 expression in C57 mouse livers resulted in increases in expression levels of lipogenic genes, including Srebp-1c and its downstream target genes (Fig. 4I). To determine whether Dec1 could repress Srebp-1c expression in primary hepatocytes, adenovirus Ad-DEC1 was used to treat hepatocytes in the presence of TO901317 compound, a well known agonist of LXRs. As expected, TO901317 treatment increased TG contents in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with increased expression of Srebp-1c and its target genes (Fig. 5B). However, Ad-DEC1 treatment reduced the TG content in primary hepatocytes in the presence or absence of TO901317 (Fig. 5A). Consistent with its effect on lipogenesis rate in hepatocytes (Fig. 4G), Dec1 overexpression could repress the expression of Srebp-1c as well as its target genes under TO901317 treatment conditions (Fig. 5B). In contrast, knockdown of endogenous Dec1 by Ad-shDEC1 in primary hepatocytes led to an increase in intracellular triglyceride content (Fig. 5C), in accordance with the increased mRNA of Srebp-1c, Fas, and Acc (Fig. 5D). These observations indicate that Dec1 regulates expression of lipogenic genes and triglyceride synthesis in a cell-autonomous manner. Our above data suggested that DEC1 is an important negative regulator of Srebp-1c gene expression. Next we wondered whether DEC1 protein binds to the Srebp-1c gene promoter and regulates its expression as a transcription repressor. ChIP assays were carried out to investigate whether endogenous DEC1 protein could be recruited to the Srebp-1c promoter"
https://openalex.org/W2094795090,"Vaccination is an important strategy in the protection of aquaculture species from major diseases. However, we still do not have a good understanding of the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced disease resistance. This is further complicated by the presence of several lymphoid organs that play different roles when mounting an immune response. In this study, we attempt to elucidate some of these mechanisms using a microarray-based approach. Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer) were vaccinated against Streptococcus iniae and the transcriptomic changes within the spleen and head kidney at one and seven days post-vaccination were profiled. We subsequently challenged the seabass at three weeks post-vaccination with live S. iniae and similarly profiled the transcriptomes of the two organs after the challenge. We found that vaccination induced an early, but transient transcriptomic change in the spleens and a delayed response in the head kidneys, which became more similar to one another compared to un-vaccinated ones. When challenged with the pathogen, the spleen, but not the head kidneys, responded transcriptomically at 25–29 hours post-challenge. A unique set of genes, in particular those involved in the activation of NF-κB signaling, was up-regulated in the vaccinated spleens upon pathogen challenge but not in the un-vaccinated spleens. A semi-quantitative PCR detection of S. iniae using metagenomic DNA extracted from the water containing the seabass also revealed that vaccination resulted in reduction of pathogen shedding. This result indicated that vaccination not only led to a successful immune defense against the infection, but also reduced the chances for horizontal transmission of the pathogen. In conclusion, we have provided a transcriptomic analysis of how the teleost spleen and head kidneys responded to vaccination and subsequent infection. The different responses from the two organs are suggestive of their unique roles in establishing a vaccine-induced disease resistance."

Here, we present results showing that CRBN can effectively regulate new protein synthesis through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a downstream target of AMPK. Whereas deficiency of Crbn repressed protein translation via activation of the AMPK-mTOR cascade in Crbn-knock-out mice, ectopic expression of the wild-type CRBN increased protein synthesis by inhibiting endogenous AMPK. Unlike the wild-type CRBN, a mutant CRBN found in human patients, which lacks the last 24 amino acids, failed to rescue mTOR-dependent repression of protein synthesis in Crbn-deficient mouse fibroblasts. These results provide the first evidence that Crbn can activate the protein synthesis machinery through the mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting AMPK. In light of the fact that protein synthesis regulated by mTOR is essential for various forms of synaptic plasticity that underlie the cognitive functions of the brain, the results of this study suggest a plausible mechanism for CRBN involvement in higher brain function in humans, and they may help explain how a specific mutation in CRBN can affect the cognitive ability of patients.

In a recent report, we described the generation of Crbn-knock-out (Crbn-KO) mice, in which the Crbn gene is deleted throughout the body (5.Lee K.M. Yang S.J. Kim Y.D. Choi Y.D. Nam J.H. Choi C.S.

Disruption of the cereblon gene enhances hepatic AMPK activity and prevents high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice.Diabetes. 2013; 62: 1855-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To validate the deficiency of Crbn in the brain, we measured levels of the Crbn mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using total RNA extracted from the brains of WT (Crbn +/+), heterozygote KO (Crbn +/−), and homozygote KO (Crbn −/−) mice (Fig. 1A). Deficiency of Crbn protein in the brains of Crbn-KO mice was also confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). CRBN-specific polyclonal antibody detected a protein band with the expected molecular mass (53 kDa) in the brains of WT mice, whereas no immunoreactivity was detected in brain lysates from Crbn homozygous KO (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression of Crbn was reduced by 44% in the brains of heterozygous KO mice. We then measured the phosphorylation level of AMPK in the hippocampi of WT and KO mice. As expected, the levels of AMPK α subunit phosphorylated at Thr-172 (P-AMPKα) in the hippocampi of Crbn +/− and Crbn −/− mice were significantly increased relative to the level in Crbn +/+ mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we investigated whether AMPK activation induced by deletion of Crbn can affect mTOR signaling. To this end, we monitored the amount of phosphorylated raptor, mTOR, S6K, S6, and 4EBP1. Higher levels of P-AMPK were accompanied with higher levels of P-raptor but with lower levels of P-mTOR, P-S6K, P-S6, and P-4EBP1 in Crbn +/− and Crbn −/− hippocampi, respectively (Fig. 2, A and C–G). Similar results were also obtained in primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 3). These findings imply that AMPK activation by Crbn deficiency can reduce cellular translation by inhibiting endogenous mTOR signaling.FIGURE 3.Suppression of mTOR signaling pathway in Crbn-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Not surprisingly, overall protein synthesis was significantly reduced in Crbn +/− and Crbn −/− MEFs relative to the level in Crbn +/+ MEFs (Fig. 4, A and B). mTORC1 regulates cap-dependent translation through phosphorylation of 4EBP1, which releases 4EBP1 from eIF-4E and promotes translation initiation (32.Ma X.M. Blenis J. Molecular mechanisms of mTOR-mediated translational control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar), so we further examined the effects of Crbn deficiency on cap-dependent translation using a relative luciferase assay (26.Chappell S.A.

As shown in Fig. 4C, cap-dependent translation was significantly suppressed in Crbn +/− and Crbn −/− MEFs. These results indicate that Crbn deficiency can inhibit not only the activation of mTOR but also cap-dependent translation, a downstream process regulated by the AMPK-mTOR signaling cascade. Because the mTOR signaling pathway was suppressed by Crbn deficiency and Crbn deficiency resulted in the constitutive activation of AMPK, we wondered whether ectopic expression of CRBN would affect the signal pathway in the opposite manner. Moreover, we also wondered how the human mutation linked to mild mental deficit influences AMPK-mTOR signaling. In ARNSMR patients, the C-terminal 24 amino acids are missing from the full-length protein of 442 amino acids, because of a nonsense mutation in CRBN (R419X) (1.Higgins J.J. Pucilowska J.

https://openalex.org/W2014144069,"Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an important tool for testing causal relationships in cognitive neuroscience research. However, the efficacy of TMS can be variable across individuals and difficult to measure. This variability is especially a challenge when TMS is applied to regions without well-characterized behavioral effects, such as in studies using TMS on multi-modal areas in intrinsic networks. Here, we examined whether perfusion fMRI recordings of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), a quantitative measure sensitive to slow functional changes, reliably index variability in the effects of stimulation. Twenty-seven participants each completed four combined TMS-fMRI sessions during which both resting state Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) and perfusion Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) scans were recorded. In each session after the first baseline day, continuous theta-burst TMS (TBS) was applied to one of three locations: left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L dlPFC), left anterior insula/frontal operculum (L aI/fO), or left primary somatosensory cortex (L S1). The two frontal targets are components of intrinsic networks and L S1 was used as an experimental control. CBF changes were measured both before and after TMS on each day from a series of interleaved resting state and perfusion scans. Although TBS led to weak selective increases under the coil in CBF measurements across the group, individual subjects showed wide variability in their responses. TBS-induced changes in rCBF were related to TBS-induced changes in functional connectivity of the relevant intrinsic networks measured during separate resting-state BOLD scans. This relationship was selective: CBF and functional connectivity of these networks were not related before TBS or after TBS to the experimental control region (S1). Furthermore, subject groups with different directions of CBF change after TBS showed distinct modulations in the functional interactions of targeted networks. These results suggest that CBF is a marker of individual differences in the effects of TBS."

This is the first study to employ an autonomous profiling (APEX) float in the Gulf of Mexico for measuring spatiotemporal variability in bio-optics and hydrography. During the 17-month deployment (July 2011 to December 2012), the float mission collected profiles of temperature, salinity, chlorophyll fluorescence, particulate backscattering (bbp), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence from the ocean surface to a depth of 1,500 m. Biogeochemical variability was characterized by distinct depth trends and local “hot spots”, including impacts from mesoscale processes associated with each of the water masses sampled, from ambient deep waters over the Florida Plain, into the Loop Current, up the Florida Canyon, and eventually into the Florida Straits. A deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) occurred between 30 and 120 m, with the DCM depth significantly related to the unique density layer ρ = 1023.6 (R2 = 0.62). Particulate backscattering, bbp, demonstrated multiple peaks throughout the water column, including from phytoplankton, deep scattering layers, and resuspension. The bio-optical relationship developed between bbp and chlorophyll (R2 = 0.49) was compared to a global relationship and could significantly improve regional ocean-color algorithms. Photooxidation and autochthonous production contributed to CDOM distributions in the upper water column, whereas in deep water, CDOM behaved as a semi-conservative tracer of water masses, demonstrating a tight relationship with density (R2 = 0.87). In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, this research lends support to the use of autonomous drifting profilers as a powerful tool for consideration in the design of an expanded and integrated observing network for the Gulf of Mexico."

This bacterium is closely related to other pathogenic Candidatus Liberibacter spp., all vectored by psyllids. In order to understand the molecular interaction of this pathogen and its psyllid vector, Bactericera cockerelli, Illumina sequencing of psyllid harboring Lso was performed to determine if this approach could be used to assess the bacterial transcriptome in this association. Prior to sequencing, psyllid RNA was purified and insect and bacterial rRNA were removed. Mapping of reads to Lso genome revealed that over 92% of the bacterial genes were expressed in the vector, and that the COG categories Translation and Post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperone functions were the most expressed functional categories. Expression levels of selected Lso genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The transcriptomic analysis also helped correct Lso genome annotation by identifying the expression of genes that were not predicted in the genome sequencing effort."
https://openalex.org/W2012676379,"Background Natural products present in low quantity in herb medicines constitute an important source of chemical diversity. However, the isolation of sufficient amounts of these low abundant constituents for structural modification has been a challenge for several decades and subsequently halts research on the utilization of this important source of chemical entities for drug discovery and development. And, pro-angiogenic therapies are being explored as options to treat cardio-cerebral vascular diseases and wound healing recently. The present study investigates the pro-angiogenic potential of tanshinone derivatives produced by one-pot synthesis using zebrafish model. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to address the difficulty of chemical modification of low abundant constituents in herb medicines, a novel one-pot combinatorial modification was used to diversify a partially purified tanshinone mixture from Salvia miltiorrhiza. This led to the isolation of ten new imidazole-tanshinones (Compounds 1–10) and one oxazole-tanshinone (Compound 11), the structures of which were characterized by spectroscopic methods in combination with single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis. The angiogenesis activities of the new tanshinone derivatives were determined in an experimental model of chemical-induced blood vessels damage in zebrafish. Of all the tested new derivatives, compound 10 exhibited the most potent vascular protective and restorative activity with an EC50 value of 0.026 µM. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the pro-angiogenesis effect of 10 probably involved the VEGF/FGF-Src-MAPK and PI3K-P38 signalling pathways by gene expression analysis and a blocking assay with pathways-specific kinase inhibitors. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, our study demonstrated the more distinctive pro-angiogenic properties of 10 than other tanshinones and revealed 10 has potential for development as a pro-angiogenic agent for diseases associated with insufficient angiogenesis. Our results highlighted the great potential of adopting a newly modified one-pot approach to enhance the chemical diversity and biological activities of constituents from natural products regardless of their abundances."
https://openalex.org/W2064706592,"Argonaute 2 (Ago2) is the only mammalian Ago protein capable of mRNA cleavage. It has been reported that the activity of the short interfering RNA targeting coding sequence (CDS), but not 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of an mRNA, is solely dependent on Ago2 in vitro. These studies utilized extremely high doses of siRNAs and overexpressed Ago proteins, as well as were directed at various highly expressed reporter transgenes. Here we report the effect of Ago2 in vivo on targeted knockdown of several endogenous genes by siRNAs, targeting both CDS and 3′UTR. We show that siRNAs targeting CDS lose their activity in the absence of Ago2, whereas both Ago1 and Ago3 proteins contribute to residual 3′UTR-targeted siRNA-mediated knockdown observed in the absence of Ago2 in mouse liver. Our results provide mechanistic insight into two components mediating RNAi under physiological conditions: mRNA cleavage dependent and independent. In addition our results contribute a novel consideration for designing most efficacious siRNA molecules with the preference given to 3′UTR targeting as to harness the activity of several Ago proteins."

A paradigm in molecular pharmacology was defined by design of rapid-acting insulin analogs for the prandial control of glycemia.

This strategy is limited by a molecular trade-off between accelerated disassembly and enhanced susceptibility to degradation. Here, we demonstrate that this trade-off may be circumvented by nonstandard mutagenesis. Our studies employed LysB28, ProB29-insulin (“lispro”) as a model prandial analog that is less thermodynamically stable and more susceptible to fibrillation than is wild-type insulin. We have discovered that substitution of an invariant tyrosine adjoining the engineered sites in lispro (TyrB26) by 3-iodo-Tyr (i) augments its thermodynamic stability (ΔΔGu 0.5 ±0.2 kcal/mol), (ii) delays onset of fibrillation (lag time on gentle agitation at 37 °C was prolonged by 4-fold), (iii) enhances affinity for the insulin receptor (1.5 ± 0.1-fold), and (iv) preserves biological activity in a rat model of diabetes mellitus. 1H NMR studies suggest that the bulky iodo-substituent packs within a nonpolar interchain crevice.

By exploiting this allosteric switch, 3-iodo-TyrB26-lispro thus illustrates how a nonstandard amino acid substitution can mitigate the unfavorable biophysical properties of an engineered protein while retaining its advantages.

HME data used in the study was reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment between years 2005–2012, and geospatial variables representing the physical environment [National Land cover/Land use, NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)], climate [NASA MODIS, Prediction of Worldwide Renewable Energy (POWER)], and socio-economic conditions (US Census Bureau) were derived from publicly available sources. Following univariate screening of candidate variables using logistic regressions, two Bayesian hierarchical models were fit; a partial spatio-temporal model with random effects and a spatio-temporal interaction term, and a second model that included additional covariate terms. The best fitting model revealed that spatio-temporal autocorrelation in Kansas increased steadily from 2005–2012, and identified poverty status, relative humidity, and an interactive factor, ‘diurnal temperature range x mixed forest area’ as significant county-level risk factors for HME. The identification of significant spatio-temporal pattern and new risk factors are important in the context of HME prevention, for future research in the areas of ecology and evolution of HME, and as well as climate change impacts on tick-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1969995620,"The reproductive cycle of the Australian sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon taylori, includes a temporary suspension of development at the commencement of embryogenesis termed embryonic diapause. This study investigated levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and progesterone (P4) in plasma samples of mature wild female R. taylori captured throughout the reproductive cycle and correlated them with internal morphological changes. Levels of T were elevated through most of the embryonic diapause period, suggesting a role of this hormone in the maintenance of this condition. Increasing plasma T concentrations from late diapause to early active development were associated with a possible role of androgens in the termination of embryonic diapause. As in other elasmobranchs, a concomitant increase of E2 with ovarian follicle size indicated a direct role of this hormone in regulating vitellogenesis, while a peak in P4 suggested this hormone is associated with preovulation and ovulation. Additionally, significant correlations between photoperiod or water temperature and maximum follicular diameter and hepatosomatic index suggest that these abiotic factors may also play a role triggering and regulating the synchrony and timing of reproductive events."

Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequence was used as a molecular marker to analyze T. tabaci populations from onion and cabbage fields in New York. Eight COI haplotypes were identified in 565 T. tabaci individuals collected from these fields. All T. tabaci were thelytokous and genetically similar to those originating from hosts representing seven plant families spanning five continents. The most dominant haplotype was NY-HT1, accounting for 92 and 88% of the total individuals collected from onion fields in mid-summer in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and 100 and 96% of the total in early fall in 2005 and 2007, respectively. In contrast, T. tabaci collected from cabbage fields showed a dynamic change in population structure from mid-summer to early fall. In mid-summer, haplotype NY-HT2 was highly abundant, accounting for 58 and 52% of the total in 2005 and 2007, respectively, but in early fall it decreased drastically to 15 and 7% of the total in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Haplotype NY-HT1 accounted for 12 and 46% of the total in cabbage fields in mid-summer of 2005 and 2007, respectively, but became the dominant haplotype in early fall accounting for 81 and 66% of the total in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Despite the relative proximity of onion and cabbage fields in the western New York landscape, T. tabaci populations differed seasonally within each cropping system. Differences may have been attributed to better establishment of certain genotypes on specific hosts or differing colonization patterns within these cropping systems. Future studies investigating temporal changes in T. tabaci populations on their major hosts in these ecosystems are needed to better understand host-plant utilization and implications for population management."

Our aim in the present study is to investigate the genetic variations in Troponin T (cTnT) gene and its association with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in south-Indian patients. Analyses of all the exons and exon-intron boundaries of cTnT in 147 DCM and in 207 healthy controls had revealed a total of 15 SNPs and a 5 bp INDEL; of which, polymorphic SNPs were compared with the HapMap population data. Interestingly, a novel R144W mutation, that substitutes polar-neutral tryptophan for a highly conserved basic arginine in cTnT, altering the charge drastically, was identified in a DCM, with a family history of sudden-cardiac death (SCD). This mutation was found within the tropomyosin (TPM1) binding domain, and was evolutionarily conserved across species, therefore it is expected to have a significant impact on the structure and function of the protein. Family studies had revealed that the R144W is co-segregating with disease in the family as an autosomal dominant trait, but it was completely absent in 207 healthy controls and in 162 previously studied HCM patients. Further screening of the proband and three of his family members (positive for R144W mutant) with eight other genes β-MYH7, MYBPC3, TPM1, TNNI3, TTN, ACTC, MYL2 and MYL3, did not reveal any disease causing mutation, proposing the absence of compound heterozygosity. Therefore, we strongly suggest that the novel R144W unique/private mutant identified in this study is associated with FDCM. This is furthermore signifying the unique genetic architecture of Indian population."

However, antiviral-resistant variants often nullify the effectiveness of antivirals. Combined medications, as seen in the treatment of cancers and other infectious diseases, have been suggested as an option for the control of antiviral-resistant influenza viruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic value of combination therapy against oseltamivir-resistant 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection in DBA/2 mice. Mice were treated for five days with favipiravir and peramivir starting 4 hours after lethal challenge. Compared with either monotherapy, combination therapy saved more mice from viral lethality and resulted in increased antiviral efficacy in the lungs of infected mice. Furthermore, the synergism between the two antivirals, which was consistent with the survival outcomes of combination therapy, indicated that favipiravir could serve as a critical agent of combination therapy for the control of oseltamivir-resistant strains. Our results provide new insight into the feasibility of favipiravir in combination therapy against oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2040599335,"The Mexican Sheartail (Doricha eliza), an endangered hummingbird, is endemic to Mexico where two populations have a disjunct distribution. One population is distributed along the northern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula whereas the other is mostly restricted to central Veracruz. Despite their disjunct distribution, previous work has failed to detect morphological or behavioral differences between these populations. Here we use variation in morphology, mtDNA and nuDNA sequences to determine the degree of morphological and molecular divergence between populations, their divergence time, and historical demography. We use species distribution modeling and niche divergence tests to infer the relative roles of vicariance and dispersal in driving divergence in the genus. Our Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed that Doricha eliza populations form a monophyletic clade and support their sister relationship with D. enicura. We found marked genetic differentiation, with reciprocal monophyly of haplotypes and highly restricted gene flow, supporting a history of isolation over the last 120,000 years. Genetic divergence between populations is consistent with the lack of overlap in environmental space and slight morphological differences between males. Our findings indicate that the divergence of the Veracruz and Yucatan populations is best explained by a combination of a short period of isolation exacerbated by subsequent divergence in climate conditions, and that rather than vicariance, the two isolated ranges of D. eliza are the product of recent colonization and divergence in isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2043945973,"Nox5 is an EF-hand containing, calcium-dependent isoform of the NADPH oxidase family of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating enzymes. Altered expression and activity of Nox5 has been reported in cardiovascular diseases and cancers but the absence of Nox5 in rodents has precluded a greater understanding of its physiological and pathophysiological roles. Multiple polymorphisms have been identified within the coding sequence of human Nox5, but whether this translates into altered enzyme function is unknown. Herein, we have generated 15 novel mutants of Nox5β to evaluate the effect of exonic SNPs on basal and stimulated enzyme activity. Compared to the WT enzyme, ROS production was unchanged or slightly modified in the majority of mutants, but significantly decreased in 7. Focusing on M77K, Nox5 activity was dramatically reduced in unstimulated cells and following challenge with both calcium- and phosphorylation-dependent stimuli despite equivalent levels of expression. The M77K mutation did not influence the Nox5 phosphorylation or the ability to bind Hsp90, but in cell-free assays with excess co-factors and calcium, ROS production was dramatically reduced. A more conservative substitution M77V arising from another SNP yielded a different profile of enzyme activity and suggests a critical role of M77 in calcium-dependent ROS production. Two C-terminal mutants, R530H and G542R, were observed that had little to no activity and relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF). In conclusion, we have identified 7 missense SNPs in Nox5 that result in little or no enzyme activity. Whether humans with dysfunctional Nox5 variants have altered physiology or disease remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2148565743,"Objectives To investigate the effect of air-drying pressure during ceramic primer coating on zirconia/resin bonding and the surface characteristics of the primed zirconia. Methods Two ceramic primers (Clearfil Ceramic Primer, CCP, Kuraray Medical Inc. and Z-Prime Plus, ZPP, Bisco Inc.) were applied on the surface of air-abraded zirconia (Katana zirconia, Noritake) and dried at 4 different air pressures (0.1–0.4 MPa). The primed zirconia ceramic specimens were bonded with a resin-based luting agent (SA Luting Cement, Kuraray). Micro-shear bond strengths of the bonded specimens were tested after 3 days of water storage or 5,000× thermocycling (n = 12). Failure modes of the fractured specimens were examined with scanning electron miscopy. The effects of air pressure on the thickness of the primer layers and the surface roughness (Sa) of primed zirconia were evaluated using spectroscopic ellipsometry (n = 6), optical profilometry and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) (n = 6), respectively. Results Clearfil Ceramic Primer air-dried at 0.3 and 0.4 MPa, yielding significantly higher µSBS than gentle air-drying subgroups (p<0.05). Compared to vigorous drying conditions, Z-Prime Plus air-dried at 0.2 MPa exhibited significantly higher µSBS (p<0.05). Increasing air-drying pressure reduced the film thickness for both primers. Profilometry measurements and ESEM showed rougher surfaces in the high pressure subgroups of CCP and intermediate pressure subgroup of ZPP. Conclusion Air-drying pressure influences resin/zirconia bond strength and durability significantly. Higher air-drying pressure (0.3-0.4 MPa) for CCP and intermediate pressure (0.2 MPa) for ZPP are recommended to produce strong, durable bonds between resin cement and zirconia ceramics."
https://openalex.org/W2006364215,"The most frequent pet allergy is to cat and dog, but in recent years, it has become increasingly popular to have other pets, and the risk of exposure to new allergens is more prevalent. The list of new pets includes hamsters, and one of the most popular hamsters is the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus). The aim of this study was the characterization and cloning of the major allergen from this hamster. The study of its allergenicity and cross-reactivity could improve the specific diagnosis and treatment for hamster-allergic patients. Thirteen Siberian hamster-allergic patients were recruited at the outpatient clinic. Protein extracts were prepared from the hair, urine, and salivary glands of four hamster species (European, golden, Siberian, and Roborovski). IgE-binding proteins were detected by immunoblotting and identified by mass spectrometry. The recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli and then purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The allergenic properties of the recombinant protein were tested by ELISA and immunoblotting, and biological activity was tested according to capacity for basophil activation. Three IgE-binding proteins were identified in extracts obtained from Siberian hamster hair, urine, and salivary glands. All proteins corresponded to the same protein, which was identified as a lipocalin. This lipocalin had no cross-reactivity with common and golden hamsters. The recombinant allergen was cloned and purified, showing similar IgE reactivity in vitro to Siberian hamster protein extracts. Also, the recombinant allergen was capable of producing biological activation in vivo. The major Siberian hamster allergen was cloned, and allergenic properties were characterized, providing a new tool for specific diagnosis of allergy to Siberian hamster."
https://openalex.org/W1990631042,"An HIV vaccine could substantially impact the epidemic. However, risk compensation (RC), or post-vaccination increase in risk behavior, could present a major challenge. The methodology used in previous studies of risk compensation has been almost exclusively individual-level in focus, and has not explored how increased risk behavior could affect the connectivity of risk networks. This study examined the impact of anticipated HIV vaccine-related RC on the structure of high-risk drug users' sexual and injection risk network.A sample of 433 rural drug users in the US provided data on their risk relationships (i.e., those involving recent unprotected sex and/or injection equipment sharing). Dyad-specific data were collected on likelihood of increasing/initiating risk behavior if they, their partner, or they and their partner received an HIV vaccine. Using these data and social network analysis, a ""post-vaccination network"" was constructed and compared to the current network on measures relevant to HIV transmission, including network size, cohesiveness (e.g., diameter, component structure, density), and centrality.Participants reported 488 risk relationships. Few reported an intention to decrease condom use or increase equipment sharing (4% and 1%, respectively). RC intent was reported in 30 existing risk relationships and vaccination was anticipated to elicit the formation of five new relationships. RC resulted in a 5% increase in risk network size (n = 142 to n = 149) and a significant increase in network density. The initiation of risk relationships resulted in the connection of otherwise disconnected network components, with the largest doubling in size from five to ten.This study demonstrates a new methodological approach to studying RC and reveals that behavior change following HIV vaccination could potentially impact risk network connectivity. These data will be valuable in parameterizing future network models that can determine if network-level change precipitated by RC would appreciably impact the vaccine's population-level effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2040031849,"The potential hazardous effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on cardiac electrophysiology are seldom evaluated. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of MWCNTs on the Kv4/Ito channel, action potential and heart rhythm and the underlying mechanisms.HEK293 cells were engineered to express Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 with or without KChIP2 expression. A series of approaches were introduced to analyze the effects of MWCNTs on Kv4/Ito channel kinetics, current densities, expression and trafficking. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the internalization of MWCNTs in HEK293 cells and rat cardiomyocytes. Current clamp was employed to record the action potentials of isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Surface ECG and epicardial monophasic action potentials were recorded to monitor heart rhythm in rats in vivo. Vagal nerve discharge monitoring and H&E staining were also performed.Induction of MWCNTs into the cytosole through pipette solution soon accelerated the decay of IKv4 in HEK293 cells expressing Kv4.2/4.3 and KChIP2, and promoted the recovery from inactivation when Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 was expressed alone. Longer exposure (6 h) to MWCNTs decreased the IKv4.2 density, Kv4.2/Kv4.3 (but not KChIP2) expression and trafficking towards the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells. In acutely isolated rat ventricular myocytes, pipette MWCNTs also quickly accelerated the decay of IKv4 and prolonged the action potential duration (APD). Intravenous infusion of MWCNTs (2 mg/rat) induced atrioventricular (AV) block and even cardiac asystole. No tachyarrhythmia was observed after MWCNTs administration. MWCNTs did not cause coronary clot but induced myocardial inflammation and increased vagus discharge.MWCNTs suppress Kv4/Ito channel activities likely at the intracellular side of plasma membrane, delay membrane repolarization and induce bradyarrhythmia. The delayed repolarization, increased vagus output and focal myocardial inflammation may partially underlie the occurrence of bradyarrhythmias induced by MWCNTs. The study warns that MWCNTs are hazardous to cardiac electrophysiology."

The onco-Lbc protein is a hyperactive Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), but its structural mechanism has not been reported despite its involvement in cardiac hypertrophy and cancer causation. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Lbc is located at the C-terminal end of the protein and is shown here to specifically recognize activated RhoA rather than lipids.

Alternately spliced AKAP variants (see Fig. 1) were discovered in a screen for transforming genes from human myeloid leukemias. The isoforms include AKAP-Lbc, which is also known as AKAP13 (6.Toksoz D. Williams D.A. Novel human oncogene lbc detected by transfection with distinct homology regions to signal transduction products.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 621-628PubMed Google Scholar) and Brx, which is specifically expressed in testis and estrogen-responsive reproductive tissues (7.Rubino D.

Relative to AKAP-Lbc, the oncogenic form, onco-Lbc, contains only the DH-PH tandem as well as a 70-residue N-terminal extension comprising residues 1922–2346 and induces constitutive GEF activity. Consequently it induces cell transformation in a Rho-dependent manner (11.Zheng Y. Olson M.F. Hall A. Cerione R.A. Toksoz D.

Cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling of the heart following stress also involve AKAP-Lbc signaling (13.Diviani D. Modulation of cardiac function by A-kinase anchoring proteins.Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2008; 8: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that the Lbc family forms a critical trigger for mitogenic signaling, deregulation of which has dire consequences. This realization has stimulated growing interest focused on Lbc for drug discovery (14.Esseltine J.L. Scott J.D.

Moreover, as several of the ∼70 such DH-PH scaffolds in the human genome are oncogenic, additional related therapeutic targets may emerge (16.Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. GEF means go: turning on RHO GTPases with guanine nucleotide-exchange factors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). The tandem DH-PH module is a prime target as it provides the core functionality required for RhoGEF activation. It captures the GDP-bound RhoA and stabilizes the nucleotide-free form until GTP is loaded and then released. Crystal structures of other DH-PH tandems indicate that the DH domain is structurally well conserved with variations in the length of its C-terminal helix and its orientation with the PH domain influencing their specific effects on GTPases (17.Snyder J.T.

The interactions mediated by DH-PH scaffolds provide complex opportunities to regulate GTPase activity. Multiple positive and negative feedback loops can be mediated by the PH domain (19.Schmidt A. Hall A. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases: turning on the switch.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), a linker region at the N terminus of the DH domain, phosphorylation, lipids, and dimerization motifs.

Recently it was shown that the PH domains of Lbc family RhoGEFs bind to membrane-tethered RhoA-GTP and promote positive feedback (21.Medina F. Carter A.M. Dada O. Gutowski S. Hadas J. Chen Z.

Chem. 2013; 288: 11325-11333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the exact Lbc mechanism remains unknown with no structures of any family member having been published. Most interesting are the unique ligand interactions of Lbc DH-PH scaffolds that could account for their specific activities (22.Viaud J. Gaits-Iacovoni F. Payrastre B. Regulation of the DH-PH tandem of guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho GTPases by phosphoinositides.Adv. Biol. Regul. 2012; 52: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Defining the structural basis of such interactions is necessary for designing selective molecular probes and inhibitors. Here we present solution structures of onco-Lbc and characterize the interactions among its DH and PH domains, RhoA, and lipids. By mapping and mutating the key residues, the mechanisms by which DH and PH domains communicate and integrate signals to control GTPase activity are revealed. The cDNA of human AKAP13 (Harvard database identification number HsCD00399180) corresponding to onco-Lbc (residues 1922–2346) or the isolated DH domain (1992–2210) was subcloned into a pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) between BamHI/SalI restriction sites and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The production of the AKAP-Lbc construct encompassing residues 2164–2346 (“DHαPH”) was as described previously (23.Sugawara M. Whittaker S.B. Bishop S. Ball L. Overduin M. Resonance assignments of the human AKAP13-PH domain and stabilizing DH helix.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Expression was induced overnight by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.3 and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and lysed, and soluble protein was purified on GST columns (GE Healthcare). Subsequently, the GST tag was cleaved with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare). Onco-Lbc constructs were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on an S75 26/60 Sephadex column using 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. The identity and purity were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Mutations were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis kits (Stratagene), and the DNA sequences were verified by sequencing. Soluble RhoA (residues 1–181) was expressed overnight in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 18 °C and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm GDP, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The protein was bound to a nickel column and eluted against an imidazole gradient. The fractions containing RhoA were pooled and further purified by size exclusion chromatography against a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. RhoA-GTP and RhoA-GDP were prepared in buffers containing an excess (10×) of GTP or GDP in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT (TB), and 10 mm EDTA. The excess nucleotide and EDTA were removed by exchange with TB containing 10 mm MgCl2. Uniformly labeled protein samples were prepared in M9 medium supplemented by 15NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl/[13C6]glucose as the sole source of nitrogen or carbon. The structure of the DHαPH domain (500 μm) of onco-Lbc was determined using NMR spectra acquired at 297 K on Varian Inova 800- and 900-MHz spectrometers equipped with triple resonance cold probes with enhanced 13C and 1H sensitivity and z axis gradients using assigned 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances (23.Sugawara M.

The protein samples were dissolved in H2O or 10% D2O and used for the acquisition of 13C- and 15N-resolved NOESY-HSQC experiments to estimate interproton distances from cross-peak volumes based on mixing times of 100 ms. The dihedral angles were derived from DANGLE (24.Cheung M.S. Maguire M.L. Stevens T.J. Broadhurst R.W. DANGLE: A Bayesian inferential method for predicting protein backbone dihedral angles and secondary structure.J. Magn.

To monitor possible interactions with plasma membrane lipids by NMR, soluble lipid titrations were carried out using dihexanoyl derivatives of phosphatidylserine, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI) dissolved in the NMR sample buffer. Interactions with micelles were tested using dodecylphosphocholine with and without CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich), which was added to help stabilize the protein. The solution structures of the DHαPH domain were calculated with ARIA2.2 (25.Rieping W. Habeck M. Bardiaux B. Bernard A. Malliavin T.E. Nilges M.

A total of 100 structures were generated at each of the eight iterations in vacuum using torsion angle dynamics. The final refinement step was performed in explicit water. Twenty representative structures were selected based on their favorable energies and minimal violations as analyzed by PROCHECK (26.Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R.

The backbone order parameters (S2) were computed using the RCI server (27.Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The 15N-labeled DHαPH and RhoA-GDP samples were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2. A series of 15N-resolved two-dimensional spectra were acquired in a solution containing DHαPH (100 μm) and after sequential addition of GTP (1 mm), RhoA-GDP (150 μm), onco-Lbc (4 nm), and finally 10 μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen) to cleave off nucleotide phosphate and thus to demonstrate the reversibility of the interaction. A structural model of onco-Lbc was built by Modeler using the DHαPH solution structure and structurally comparable DH domains from ARHGEF1 (p115), ARHGEF11 (PDZRhoGEF or PRG), ARHGEF12 (LARG), and Intersectin structures (Protein Data Bank codes 1TDX, 3ODO, 1XCG, and 1KI1). The orientations of onco-Lbc DH and PH domain residues were based on conserved DHαPH fold features common to the crystal structures and by the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) envelope.

Scattering patterns were collected at room temperature at protein concentrations between 2.0 and 6.1 mg/ml in 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. Background scattering caused by buffer alone was automatically subtracted from the protein scattering profiles. The data were processed using the ATSAS package (31.Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I.

Nucleotide exchange upon addition of onco-Lbc was measured on an LS55 PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrophotometer at 25 °C in TB containing 10 mm MgCl2. Nucleotide exchange activities used to compare the activities of AKAP-Lbc constructs in various conditions were carried out using 2 μm RhoA-GDP and 400 nm Mant-GTP (Invitrogen). For production of liposomes, a lipid stock of palmitoyloleylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti) at 2 mm was prepared in TB with 10 mm MgCl2 by successive freezing and thawing cycles. The resulting suspension was extruded through a 30-nm polycarbonate filter before the experiment. Exchange rates were measured from solutions containing RhoA loaded with Mant-GDP (500 nm) (Invitrogen) and the GTP analog GMP-PNP (100 μm) (Sigma). The rates of exchange were determined from the fluorescence change (excitation, 356 nm; emission, 440 nm) fitted to a single exponential. The GEF activities were calculated for concentrations of onco-Lbc ranging from 25 to 800 nm where the exchange activity varies linearly with the enzyme concentration. The oligomeric state of AKAP-Lbc was assessed by sedimentation velocity experiments in a Beckman XLI ultracentrifuge using an eight-cell 50Ti rotor in 20 mm Tris, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm EDTA at 20 °C and 40,000 rpm. Proteins were detected from their absorbance at 280 nm. The viscosity and density of the solution were calculated from Sednterp (35.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.

J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar) using a continuous distribution model. A hexahistidine-tagged RhoA sample was exchanged overnight with nonhydrolyzable derivative GDPβS or GTPγS as described above. RhoA (200 nm; 30 μl) was coated on a nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip on a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 10 μl·min−1 and rinsed with a pulse of imidazole (3 mm). The reference lanes were coated with hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin. Experiments were carried out using a phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.4 containing 1 mm MgCl2. Untagged onco-Lbc and DHαPH were injected (75 μl; 200-s dissociation time) in separate experiments to avoid cross-contamination between the RhoA-GDP and RhoA-GTP. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software. To elucidate the respective orientation of the DH and PH domains in solution, we first determined the NMR structure of the PH domain and attached α6 helix of the DH domain. Constructs spanning only the canonical PH domain were markedly different in their NMR spectra and were also intrinsically unstable, suggesting that the α6 helix stabilizes the structure of the PH domain. This was despite extensive buffer screening of multiple AKAP-Lbc constructs using thermal shift assays with over 96 distinct buffer, salt, pH, and osmolyte conditions. This optimization did yield a stable construct in a physiological buffer suitable for NMR studies (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3). The solution structure was calculated using 3564 distance, 234 dihedral angle, and 27 hydrogen bond restraints. The resulting ensemble of structures exhibited a backbone root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å for the structured elements between residues Gly2186 and Glu2346 (Fig. 2A and Table 1), whereas residues Ser2162–Ile2185 were unstructured. Thus, the minimal structural unit that is stably folded spans residues Gly2186–Glu2346. This represents what we term the DHαPH fold in recognition of the obligate integration of the PH fold with the last helix of the DH domain.TABLE 1Structural statistics for the solution structures of the onco-Lbc DHαPH domainDistance and dihedral constraintsDistance constraints1H-1H NOE3537Intraresidue (i = j)1323Small (|i − j| = 1)517Medium (2 ≥ |i − j| < 5)335Long range (|i − j| ≥ 5)842Ambiguous520Hydrogen bonds27Total dihedral angle restraintsφ, Ψ235Structure statisticsViolationsaAveraged per structure.Distance constraints (Å) (>0.5 Å)1.4Dihedral angle constraints (°)0.4Deviations from idealized geometryBond lengths (Å)0.00674 ± 0.00038Bond angles (°)0.839 ± 0.027Improper angles (°)2.276 ± 0.364Average pairwise r.m.s. deviationbResidues Ile2185–Glu2346.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the DHαPH domain of AKAP-Lbc differs in several significant ways from the canonical PH folds. A segment spanning eight amino acids (Phe2271–Thr2279) splits the β4 strand into two short strands, β4′ and β4″ and forms a bulge that obstructs the canonical lipid binding site found in PH domains (Fig. 2B). This element is structured based on NOE cross-peaks within the bulge (Leu2274-Lys2277 and Leu2274-Thr2279) and within the β4″ strand (Lys2277-Val2280 and Ser2278-Val2280) and the order parameters (27.Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. A simple method to predict protein flexibility using secondary chemical shifts.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 14970-14971Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), which indicate that this motif is structured. This represents a significant divergence from ARHGEF1, ARHGEF11, and ARHGEF12, which all possess an additional 11 residues here and form a highly flexible motif, suggesting a functional difference. The linker region between the DH and PH domains forms a short helix encompassing Lys2224–Arg2229 and an unstructured loop that folds back onto the strands of the PH domain (Fig. 2C). The linker helix interacts with the α6 helix through residues Leu2201, Ile2204, and Tyr2205 to form an ordered hydrophobic core that involves PH residues β3-Leu2262 and β4-Tyr2269 as well as linker residues Leu2227 and Leu2232 (Fig. 2D). This infers that Lbc-type PH domains only assume independently folded stable structures in solution when interdigitating their cores with the α6 and linker helices. Thus, β sheets of these PH domains may have evolved to endow unique functional and stabilizing features. The dynamics of the DHαPH protein residues were characterized using secondary chemical shifts of backbone atoms (27.Berjanskii M.V. Wishart D.S. A simple method to predict protein"
https://openalex.org/W2042680315,"Background Dietary supplement use is increasing despite lack of evidence of benefits, or evidence of harm. Press releases issued by the supplements industry might contribute to this situation by using ‘spin’ (strategies to hype or denigrate findings) to distort the results of clinical studies. We assessed press releases issued in response to publication of clinical studies on dietary supplements. Methods and Findings We analyzed 47 supplements industry press releases and 91 non-industry press releases and news stories, generated in response to 46 clinical studies of dietary supplements published between 1/1/2005 and 5/31/2013. The primary outcome was ‘spin’ content and direction. We also assessed disposition towards use of dietary supplements, reporting of study information, and dissemination of industry press releases. More supplements industry press releases (100%) contained ‘spin’ than non-industry media documents (55%, P<0.001). Hyping ‘spin’ scores were higher in industry than non-industry media documents for studies reporting benefit of supplements (median ‘spin’ score 3.3, 95% CI 1.0–5.5 vs 0.5, 0–1.0; P<0.001). Denigratory ‘spin’ scores were higher in industry than non-industry media documents for studies reporting no effect (6.0, 5.0–7.0 vs 0, 0–0; P<0.001) or harm (6.0, 5.5–7.5 vs 0, 0–0.5; P<0.001) from a supplement. Industry press releases advocated supplement use in response to >90% of studies that reported no benefit, or harm, of the supplement. Industry press releases less frequently reported study outcomes, sample size, and estimates of effect size than non-industry media documents (all P<0.001), particularly for studies that reported no benefit of supplements. Industry press releases were referenced by 148 news stories on the websites of 6 organizations that inform manufacturers, retailers and consumers of supplements. Conclusions Dietary supplements industry press releases issued in response to clinical research findings are characterized by ‘spin’ that hypes results that are favourable to supplement use and denigrates results that are not."
https://openalex.org/W2076549719,"Background and Purpose Tranilast, in addition to its capacity to inhibit mast cell degranulation, has other biological effects, including inhibition of reactive oxygen species, cytokines, leukotrienes and prostaglandin release. In the current study, we analyzed whether tranilast could alter endothelial function in rat mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA). Experimental Approach Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was analyzed in MRA (untreated and 1-hour tranilast treatment) from 6 month-old Wistar rats. To assess the possible participation of endothelial nitric oxide or prostanoids, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was analyzed in the presence of L-NAME or indomethacin. The participation of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in acetylcholine-induced response was analyzed by preincubation with TRAM-34 plus apamin or by precontraction with a high K+ solution. Nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide anion levels were measured, as well as vasomotor responses to NO donor DEA-NO and to large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel opener NS1619. Key Results Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was greater in tranilast-incubated MRA. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilation was decreased by L-NAME in a similar manner in both experimental groups. Indomethacin did not modify vasodilation. Preincubation with a high K+ solution or TRAM-34 plus apamin reduced the vasodilation to ACh more markedly in tranilast-incubated segments. NO and superoxide anion production, and vasodilator responses to DEA-NO or NS1619 remained unmodified in the presence of tranilast. Conclusions and Implications Tranilast increased the endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine in rat MRA. This effect is independent of the nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase pathways but involves EDHF, and is mediated by an increased role of small conductance calcium-activated K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W2133854991,"To build a detailed circuit diagram in the brain, one needs to measure functional synaptic connections between specific types of neurons. A high-resolution circuit diagram should provide detailed information at subcellular levels such as soma, distal and basal dendrites. However, a limitation lies in the difficulty of studying long-range connections between brain areas separated by millimeters. Brain slice preparations have been widely used to help understand circuit wiring within specific brain regions. The challenge exists because long-range connections are likely to be cut in a brain slice. The optogenetic approach overcomes these limitations, as channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) is efficiently transported to axon terminals that can be stimulated in brain slices. Here, we developed a novel fiber optic based simple method of optogenetic stimulation: the laserspritzer approach. This method facilitates the study of both long-range and local circuits within brain slice preparations. This is a convenient and low cost approach that can be easily integrated with a slice electrophysiology setup, and repeatedly used upon initial validation. Our data with direct ChR2 mediated-current recordings demonstrates that the spatial resolution of the laserspritzer is correlated with the size of the laserspritzer, and the resolution lies within the 30 µm range for the 5 micrometer laserspritzer. Using olfactory cortical slices, we demonstrated that the laserspritzer approach can be applied to selectively activate monosynaptic perisomatic GABAergic basket synapses, or long-range intracortical glutamatergic inputs formed on different subcellular domains within the same cell (e.g. distal and proximal dendrites). We discuss significant advantages of the laserspritzer approach over the widely used collimated LED whole-field illumination method in brain slice electrophysiological research."
https://openalex.org/W1968315510,"Functionally heterogeneous populations of serotonergic neurons, located within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), play a role in stress-related behaviors and neuropsychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Abnormal development of these neurons may permanently alter their structure and connections, making the organism more susceptible to anxiety-related disorders. A factor that critically regulates the development of serotonergic neurons is fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8). In this study, we used acute restraint stress followed by behavioral testing to examine whether Fgf8 signaling during development is important for establishing functional stress- and anxiety-related DR neurocircuits in adulthood. Wild-type and heterozygous male mice globally hypomorphic for Fgf8 were exposed to acute restraint stress and then tested for anxiety-like behavior on the elevated plus-maze. Further, we measured c-Fos immunostaining as a marker of serotonergic neuronal activation and tissue 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations as a marker of serotonin functional output. Results showed that Fgf8 hypomorphs exhibited 1) an exaggerated response of DR anxiety-promoting circuits and 2) a blunted response of a DR panic-inhibiting circuit to stress, effects that together were associated with increased baseline anxiety-like behavior. Overall, our results provide a neural substrate upon which Fgf8 deficiency could affect stress response and support the hypothesis that developmental disruptions of serotonergic neurons affect their postnatal functional integrity."
