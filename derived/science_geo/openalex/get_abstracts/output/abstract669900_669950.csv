https://openalex.org/W3133980772,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread effects across the globe, and its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, continues to spread. Effective interventions need to be developed to end this pandemic. Single and combination therapies with monoclonal antibodies have received emergency use authorization1-3, and more treatments are under development4-7. Furthermore, multiple vaccine constructs have shown promise8, including two that have an approximately 95% protective efficacy against COVID-199,10. However, these interventions were directed against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in 2019. The recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 in the UK11 and B.1.351 in South Africa12 is of concern because of their purported ease of transmission and extensive mutations in the spike protein. Here we show that B.1.1.7 is refractory to neutralization by most monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain of the spike protein and is relatively resistant to a few monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain. It is not more resistant to plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 or sera from individuals who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.351 variant is not only refractory to neutralization by most monoclonal antibodies against the N-terminal domain but also by multiple individual monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding motif of the receptor-binding domain, which is mostly due to a mutation causing an E484K substitution. Moreover, compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2, B.1.351 is markedly more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (9.4-fold) and sera from individuals who have been vaccinated (10.3-12.4-fold). B.1.351 and emergent variants13,14 with similar mutations in the spike protein present new challenges for monoclonal antibody therapies and threaten the protective efficacy of current vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3135383916,"Continued uncontrolled transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in many parts of the world is creating conditions for substantial evolutionary changes to the virus1,2. Here we describe a newly arisen lineage of SARS-CoV-2 (designated 501Y.V2; also known as B.1.351 or 20H) that is defined by eight mutations in the spike protein, including three substitutions (K417N, E484K and N501Y) at residues in its receptor-binding domain that may have functional importance3-5. This lineage was identified in South Africa after the first wave of the epidemic in a severely affected metropolitan area (Nelson Mandela Bay) that is located on the coast of the Eastern Cape province. This lineage spread rapidly, and became dominant in Eastern Cape, Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces within weeks. Although the full import of the mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data-which show rapid expansion and displacement of other lineages in several regions-suggest that this lineage is associated with a selection advantage that most plausibly results from increased transmissibility or immune escape6-8."
https://openalex.org/W3134653900,"Extensive global sampling and sequencing of the pandemic virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have enabled researchers to monitor its spread and to identify concerning new variants. Two important determinants of variant spread are how frequently they arise within individuals and how likely they are to be transmitted. To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted."
https://openalex.org/W3135411054,"One dose or two? For two-dose vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, some jurisdictions have decided to delay the second dose to rapidly get the vaccine into more people. The consequences of deviating from manufacturer-prescribed dosing regimens are unknown but will depend on the strength of immune responses to the vaccines. Saad-Roy et al. took a modeling approach to tackling the inevitable uncertainties facing vaccine rollout. The authors found that although one-dose strategies generally reduce infections in the short term, in the long term, the outcome depends on immune robustness. A one-dose strategy may increase the potential for antigenic evolution if immune responses are suboptimal and the virus continues to replicate in some vaccinated people, potentially leading to immune-escape mutations. It is critical to gather serological data from vaccinated people and, to avoid negative outcomes, to ramp up vaccination efforts worldwide. Science , this issue p. 363"
https://openalex.org/W3134627077,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global economic and health crisis. To identify host factors essential for coronavirus infection, we performed genome-wide functional genetic screens with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human coronavirus 229E. These screens uncovered virus-specific as well as shared host factors, including TMEM41B and PI3K type 3. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 requires the lysosomal protein TMEM106B to infect human cell lines and primary lung cells. TMEM106B overexpression enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as pseudovirus infection, suggesting a role in viral entry. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequencing of airway cells from patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that TMEM106B expression correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study uncovered a collection of coronavirus host factors that may be exploited to develop drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection or future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3134608480,"Cell death can be executed by regulated apoptotic and nonapoptotic pathways, including the iron-dependent process of ferroptosis. Small molecules are essential tools for studying the regulation of cell death. Using time-lapse imaging and a library of 1,833 bioactive compounds, we assembled a large compendium of kinetic cell death modulatory profiles for inducers of apoptosis and ferroptosis. From this dataset we identify dozens of ferroptosis suppressors, including numerous compounds that appear to act via cryptic off-target antioxidant or iron chelating activities. We show that the FDA-approved drug bazedoxifene acts as a potent radical trapping antioxidant inhibitor of ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. ATP-competitive mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, by contrast, are on-target ferroptosis inhibitors. Further investigation revealed both mTOR-dependent and mTOR-independent mechanisms that link amino acid metabolism to ferroptosis sensitivity. These results highlight kinetic modulatory profiling as a useful tool to investigate cell death regulation. Kinetic modulatory profiling identifies regulators of ferroptosis, including the FDA-approved drug bazedoxifene, which acts in an off-target manner as a radical trapping antioxidant while mTOR inhibitors increased resistance to ferroptosis."
https://openalex.org/W3135254146,"O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is an essential and dynamic post-translational modification that is presented on thousands of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. Interrogating the role of O-GlcNAc on a single target protein is crucial, yet challenging to perform in cells. Herein, we developed a nanobody-fused split O-GlcNAcase (OGA) as an O-GlcNAc eraser for selective deglycosylation of a target protein in cells. After systematic cellular optimization, we identified a split OGA with reduced inherent deglycosidase activity that selectively removed O-GlcNAc from the desired target protein when directed by a nanobody. We demonstrate the generality of the nanobody-fused split OGA using four nanobodies against five target proteins and use the system to study the impact of O-GlcNAc on the transcription factors c-Jun and c-Fos. The nanobody-directed O-GlcNAc eraser provides a new strategy for the functional evaluation and engineering of O-GlcNAc via the selective removal of O-GlcNAc from individual proteins directly in cells."

https://openalex.org/W3134771351,"Psychiatric disorders are highly genetically correlated, but little research has been conducted on the genetic differences between disorders. We developed a new method (case–case genome-wide association study; CC-GWAS) to test for differences in allele frequency between cases of two disorders using summary statistics from the respective case–control GWAS, transcending current methods that require individual-level data. Simulations and analytical computations confirm that CC-GWAS is well powered with effective control of type I error. We applied CC-GWAS to publicly available summary statistics for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and five other psychiatric disorders. CC-GWAS identified 196 independent case–case loci, including 72 CC-GWAS-specific loci that were not significant at the genome-wide level in the input case–control summary statistics; two of the CC-GWAS-specific loci implicate the genes KLF6 and KLF16 (from the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors), which have been linked to neurite outgrowth and axon regeneration. CC-GWAS loci replicated convincingly in applications to datasets with independent replication data. Identification of the genetic differences between two different disorders has been hampered by a need for individual-level data from cases of both disorders. CC-GWAS enables the comparison of allele frequencies among cases of two disorders using case–control GWAS summary statistics."
https://openalex.org/W3134986336,"Entrepreneurship activity varies significantly across cities. We use the novel data for 1,652 ecosystem actors across sixteen cities in nine developing and transition economies during 2018–2019 to examine the role that institutional context plays in facilitating the productive entrepreneurship and reducing the unproductive entrepreneurship. This study is the first to develop and test a model of multi-dimensional institutional arrangements in cities. It demonstrates that not just that institutions matter in shaping the entrepreneurship ecosystem in cities, but in particular those institutional arrangements enhancing the productive and reducing unproductive entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that differences between normative, cognitive, and regulatory pillars are associated with variance in both types of entrepreneurship in cities. For the formation of productive and high-growth entrepreneurs, all three pillars of institutional arrangement matter. For unproductive entrepreneurship normative pillar of institutions and the role of civil society matter most. This study has theoretical and practical implications for entrepreneurship ecosystem policy in cities."
https://openalex.org/W3135804496,"Purpose There has been considerable controversy regarding susceptibility of adolescents (10–19 years) and youth (15–24 years) to COVID-19. However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. Methods We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group) ÷ (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed—% expected)/ % expected] x 100. Results Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p &lt; .00001), as was percentage observed ÷ percentage expected (p &lt; .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p &lt; 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p&lt; 0.00001). Conclusions Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested, and we note that public health messaging targeting adolescents and youth might be helpful in curbing the pandemic. Also, the findings of the potential for high transmission among adolescents and youth, should be factored into decisions regarding school reopening."
https://openalex.org/W3134204445,"Lysosomes must maintain the integrity of their limiting membrane to ensure efficient fusion with incoming organelles and degradation of substrates within their lumen. Pancreatic cancer cells upregulate lysosomal biogenesis to enhance nutrient recycling and stress resistance, but it is unknown whether dedicated programmes for maintaining the integrity of the lysosome membrane facilitate pancreatic cancer growth. Using proteomic-based organelle profiling, we identify the Ferlin family plasma membrane repair factor Myoferlin as selectively and highly enriched on the membrane of pancreatic cancer lysosomes. Mechanistically, lysosomal localization of Myoferlin is necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of lysosome health and provides an early acting protective system against membrane damage that is independent of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-mediated repair network. Myoferlin is upregulated in human pancreatic cancer, predicts poor survival and its ablation severely impairs lysosome function and tumour growth in vivo. Thus, retargeting of plasma membrane repair factors enhances the pro-oncogenic activities of the lysosome. Gupta et al. show that the membrane repair factor Myoferlin protects against membrane damage of pancreatic cancer lysosomes to sustain enhanced lysosomal function and promote tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W3134882518,"Background The psychological distress and sleep problems caused by current Covid-19 outbreak is not well known in kidney transplant recipients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between perceived stress with sleep quality, insomnia, anxiety, depression and kidney function in kidney transplant recipients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Material and methods A hundred-six kidney transplant recipients were enrolled. Questionnaire of ""Socio-demographics"", ""Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)"", ""Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)"", ""Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)"" and “Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)” are performed. The laboratory data is recorded. The perceived stress related to Covid-19 pandemic and its associations were investigated. Results The mean age of patients was 44.2±13.3 years, and 65 of the patients (61.3%) were men. Forty-nine (46.2%) of the patients had high-perceived stress; 51 (48.1%) of the patients had poor sleep quality, 40 (37.7%) of the patients had insomnia, 25 (23.6%) of the patients had anxiety and 47 (44.3%) of the patients had depression. The patients having a history of Covid-19 infection in own or closed relatives (9.09±4.17 vs 6.49±4.16, p:0.014) and the patients who have a rejection episode any of time (8.24±5.16 vs 6.37±3.57, p:0.033) have had significantly higher anxiety scores, when they compared to others. The high PSS were positively correlated with PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Regression analyses revealed that high-perceived stress is an independent predictor of anxiety and depression. There was not significant difference between kidney function with PSS, PSQI, ISI, HAD-A and HAD-D. Conclusions High PSS is positively correlated with poor sleep quality and insomnia and also an independent predictor of anxiety and depression in kidney transplant recipients during the outbreak of Covid-19. As the pandemic is still spreading worldwide quickly early identification and intervention of sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders are essential to protect graft function with high compliance to treatment in transplantation patients."
https://openalex.org/W3135335705,"Damage to the cervical epithelial layer due to infection and inflammation is associated with preterm birth. However, the individual and/or collective roles of cervical epithelial layers in maintaining cervical integrity remain unclear during infection/inflammation. To determine the intercellular interactions, we developed an organ-on-chip of the cervical epithelial layer (CE-OOC) composed of two co-culture chambers connected by microchannels, recapitulating the ectocervical and endocervical epithelial layers. Further, we tested the interactions between cells from each distinct region and their contributions in maintaining cervical integrity in response to LPS and TNFα stimulations. The co-culture of ectocervical and endocervical cells facilitated cellular migration of both epithelial cells inside the microchannels. Compared to untreated controls, both LPS and TNFα increased apoptosis, necrosis, and senescence as well as increased pro-inflammatory cytokine productions by cervical epithelial cells. In summary, the CE-OOC established an in vitro model that can recapitulate the ectocervical and the endocervical epithelial regions of the cervix. The established CE-OOC may become a powerful tool in obstetrics and gynecology research such as in studying cervical remodeling during pregnancy and parturition and the dynamics of cervical epithelial cells in benign and malignant pathology in the cervix."

The role of biliary microbiota as an environment-related modulator has been scarcely investigated in CCA, and the putative impact of associated diseases has not been yet assessed. We characterized the biliary microbiota in CCA patients in order to identify a specific CCA-related dysbiosis. The biliary effluents were collected through an endoscopic retrograde pancreatic cholangiography (ERCP) examination involving 28 CCA and 47 patients with gallstones, herein considered as controls. The biliary effluents were submitted to bacterial DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing, using Illumina technology. Overall, 32% of CCA and 22% of controls displayed another associated disease, such as diabetes, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or primary sclerosing cholangitis. Such associated diseases were considered in the comparisons that were made. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) detected a significant disparity of biliary microbiota composition between CCA patients and controls without an associated disease. Amongst the most abundant phyla, Proteobacteria did not significantly differ between CCA patients and controls, whereas Firmicutes levels were lower and Bacteroidetes higher in CCAs' biliary microbiota than in the controls' microbiota. The most abundant genera were Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Klebsiella, and Pyramidobacter in CCA's biliary microbiota. Additionally, levels of Bacteroides, Geobacillus, Meiothermus, and Anoxybacillus genera were significantly higher in CCA patients' biliary microbiota, without an associated disease, in comparison with controls. A specific CCA-related dysbiosis was identified as compared to controls independently from associated diseases. This suggests that a microorganism community may be involved in CCA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3135199330,"As fish constitute the first evolutionary group with primordial T cells, they are of importance for understanding the origin and evolution of adaptive immunity. Yet, the knowledge about how ancestral T cells function remains limited. Therefore, the teleost model Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was used in this study to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of T-cell immunity in fish. We identified an evolutionarily conserved canonical NF-κB signaling pathway in Nile tilapia, which participates in primary adaptive immune response during Streptococcus agalactiae infection. Blockade of NF-κB activity severely impairs T-cell activation and expansion, rendering the animals more vulnerable to pathogen attack. Meanwhile, NF-κB signaling is indispensable for fish T cells to produce IL-17A during the antibacterial immune response. Moreover, IL-17A binds its receptor IL-17RA, initiates the ACT1–TRAF6–TAK1 axis, and triggers NF-κB-dependent T-cell activation, thus forming a positive feedback loop of T-cell immunity in Nile tilapia. Furthermore, IL-17A seems to promote innate immunity by regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines via TRAF6–NF–κB axis, indicating the presence of an NF-κB-dependent IL-17A signaling pathway for coordinating adaptive and innate immunity in fish. Our results suggest that fish NF-κB couples TCR and IL-17 signals to modulate ancestral T-cell immunity against bacterial infection, and the regulation of T-cell immunity by NF-κB and IL-17 is a strategy that existed prior to the divergence of the tetrapod lineage from teleost fish. This study, therefore, provides a new perspective on the evolution of adaptive immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3133767462,"Introduction Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities. How ethnicity affects Indigenous peoples in Mexico is unclear. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. Methods We used open access data from the Mexican Ministry of Health, which includes data of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. We used descriptive statistics to compare differences among different groups of patients. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. Results From February 28 to August 3, 2020, a total of 416546 adult patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these, 4178 were Indigenous peoples. Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5% vs 11.1%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7% vs 1.7%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). Discussion In this large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W3134540747,"The study aimed to identify the effects of situational (match location, match outcome and strength of team/opponent team) and environmental (ambient temperature, relative humidity, WBGT, ground and weather condition) factors on the physical and technical activity of elite football on individual playing positions. Physical and technical activity were collected from 779 football players competing in the German Bundesliga during 5 domestic seasons, from 2014/2015 to 2018/2019, totalling 1530 matches. The data on players' physical and technical activity was taken from the IMPIRE AG system. Based on the available data, 11 variables were selected to quantify the match activity profiles of players. The results showed that situational variables had major effects on the technical performance (especially number of passes performed) but minor effects on physical performance. In turn, among the analysed environmental factors, temperature is the most sensitive, which affects the Total Distance and Sprint Efforts of players in all five positions. This investigation demonstrated that, given that passing is a key technical activity in modern football, players and training staff should be particularly aware that passing maybe affected by situational variables. Professional players are able to react and adapt to various environmental conditions, modifying physical activity depending on the needs in German Bundesliga. These results could help coaches and analysts to better understand the influences of situational and environmental variables on individual playing positions during the evaluation of players' physical and technical performance."
https://openalex.org/W3133684845,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of the bone that predominantly affects children and adolescents. Hippo pathway is a crucial regulator of organ size and tumorigenesis. However, how Hippo pathway regulates the occurrence of osteosarcoma is largely unknown. Here, we reported the regulator of G protein signaling protein 12 (RGS12) is a novel Hippo pathway regulator and tumor suppressor of osteosarcoma. Depletion of Rgs12 promotes osteosarcoma progression and lung metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. Our data showed that the knockdown of RGS12 upregulates Ezrin expression through promoting the GNA12/13-RhoA-YAP pathway. Moreover, RGS12 negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of YAP/TEAD1 complex through its PDZ domain function to inhibit the expression and function of the osteosarcoma marker Ezrin. PDZ domain peptides of RGS12 can inhibit the development of intratibial tumor and lung metastases. Collectively, this study identifies that the RGS12 is a novel tumor suppressor in osteosarcoma through inhibiting YAP-TEAD1-Ezrin signaling pathway and provides a proof of principle that targeting RGS12 may be a therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma."

Previous available literature established an associaton between various demographic and socio-economic factors with the health and well-being of older adults in India; however, the influence of childless aged is neglected. Therefore, the study examined the gender differential in psychological health and subjective well-being among older adults, focusing on childless older adults.This study utilized data from Building a Knowledge Base on Population Aging in India (BKPAI). Psychological health and subjective well-being were examined for 9541 older adults aged 60 years & above. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis were used to find the preliminary results. Further, multivariate analysis has been done to fulfill the objective of the study.Around one-fifth (21.2%) of the men reported low psychological health, whereas around one-fourth (25.5%) of the women reported low psychological health. Further, around 24 per cent of men and 29 per cent of women reported low subjective well-being. Results found that low psychological well-being (OR = 1.87, C.I. = 1.16-3.01), as well as low subjective well-being (OR = 1.78, C.I. = 1.15-2.76), was higher in childless older women than in childless older men. Higher education, community involvement, good self-rated health, richest wealth quintile, and residing in urban areas significantly decrease the odds of low subjective well-being and low psychological well-being among older adults.There is a need to improve older adults' psychological health and subjective well-being through expanded welfare provisions, especially for childless older adults. Moreover, there is an immediate requirement to cater to the needs of poor and uneducated older adults."

We therefore examined the identity of proteoglycans, including the pendent glycosaminoglycans, produced by polarized macrophages to gain insight into the molecular basis for LDL binding.

Among the proteoglycans secreted by macrophages, we found perlecan was the major protein core that bound LDL. In addition, we identified perlecan in the necrotic core as well as the fibrous cap of advanced human atherosclerotic lesions in the same regions as HS and colocalized with M2 macrophages, suggesting a functional role in lipid retention in vivo. These findings suggest that macrophages may contribute to LDL retention in the plaque by the production of proteoglycans; however, their contribution likely depends on both their phenotype within the plaque and the presence of enzymes, such as heparanase, that alter the secreted protein structure.

Glycosaminoglycans are composed of repeating disaccharide units modified with sulfate groups at various positions. Glycosaminoglycan family members include chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate (HS), and heparin. In addition, hyaluronan is a glycosaminoglycan; however, it is synthesized at the cell membrane and does not decorate a core protein (12Iozzo R.V. Schaefer L. Proteoglycan form and function: A comprehensive nomenclature of proteoglycans.Matrix Biol. 2015; 42: 11-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Sulfated glycosaminoglycans bind LDL via electrostatic interactions, with the dense negative sulfated regions of glycosaminoglycans binding clusters of basic amino acids in the protein component of LDL, apolipoprotein B-100 (13Mahley R.W.

Perlecan, an HS proteoglycan, is abundant in the normal vascular basement membrane; however, its expression in this region is decreased during atherosclerosis (29Volker W. Schmidt A. Oortmann W.

Buddecke E. Relationship of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and cholesterol content in normal and arteriosclerotic human aorta.Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 154-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perlecan, however, is highly expressed in both the necrotic core and fibrous cap of advanced plaques (31Vikranadithyan R.K. Kako Y. Chen G. Hu Y. Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Yamada Y. Goldberg I.J.

The altered microenvironment within the vascular wall during atherosclerosis, such as increased infiltration of monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages, as well as activation of smooth muscle cells, suggests that these cells may contribute to proteoglycan-mediated lipid retention (25Chang M.Y. Olin K.L. Tsoi C. Wight T.N. Chait A.

For example, transforming growth factor-β1 signals smooth muscle cells to synthesize proteoglycans with longer glycosaminoglycan chains that exhibit an increased affinity for LDL compared with proteoglycans synthesized by quiescent cells (5Camejo G.

Macrophages cultured in vitro under hypoxic conditions to simulate the plaque environment increase versican and perlecan expression, and their affinity for LDL, owing to their longer glycosaminoglycan chains with increased sulfation (36Asplund A.

Although the phenotype of these macrophages was not described, these studies suggest that macrophages in the atherosclerotic plaque can alter their synthesis of proteoglycans, which in turn could influence LDL binding and oxidation. Macrophages exhibit pro- or anti-inflammatory properties depending on the cytokines present in their microenvironment (38Hamilton T.A. Ohmori Y. Tebo J.M. Kishore R. Regulation of macrophage gene expression by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.Pathobiology. 1999; 67: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Polarization of macrophages can be achieved via classical activation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to produce proinflammatory or M1 macrophages while alternative activation with interleukin (IL)-4 produces anti-inflammatory, reparative, or M2 macrophages (39Martinez F.O.

Both M1 and M2 macrophages are present within plaques with both types found within the fibrous cap while M1 dominates in the shoulder regions and M2 dominates in the adventitia (42Stoger J.L.

Fletcher J.P. Differing association of macrophage subsets with atherosclerotic plaque stability.Int. Angiol. 2013; 32: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). While M1 macrophages are associated with plaque instability, M2 macrophages provide structural integrity to the plaque (44Medbury H.J. James V. Ngo J. Hitos K. Wang Y. Harris D.C. Fletcher J.P. Differing association of macrophage subsets with atherosclerotic plaque stability.Int. Angiol. 2013; 32: 74-84PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the prospect of stabilizing plaques by modulating the balance of resident M1/M2 macrophages (45Bi Y. Chen J. Hu F. Liu J. Li M. Zhao L. M2 macrophages as a potential target for antiatherosclerosis treatment.Neural Plasticity. 2019; 20196724903Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, this has been shown in mice (46Zhang X. Liu M.H. Qiao L. Zhang X.Y. Liu X.L. Dong M. Dai H.Y. Ni M. Luan X.R. Guan J. Lu H.X. Ginsenoside Rb1 enhances atherosclerotic plaque stability by skewing macrophages to the M2 phenotype.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2018; 22: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the utility of this approach requires an understanding of the contribution of macrophage subsets to proteoglycan secretion and LDL binding. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the proteoglycans, and pendent glycosaminoglycans, produced by M1 and M2 polarized macrophages and to examine their role in LDL binding. As the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans have been established to bind LDL and assist in its internalization by macrophages, it was of interest to determine the pattern of expression of the major glycosaminoglycans, namely CS and HS, in advanced human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. The plaques displayed a well-formed fibrous cap over the necrotic core comprising macrophage foam cells (Fig. 1). CS was distributed throughout the plaque (Fig. 1A (i)), both in the fibrous cap and in the necrotic core (Fig. 1A (ii)). In addition, HS was abundant in the necrotic core with weaker staining exhibited in the fibrous cap (Fig. 1B (i) and (ii)). The isotype control did not show any positive staining, indicating that the CS and HS staining was specific (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that both CS and HS were present in the lipid-rich necrotic core. The use of primary macrophages for proteoglycan biochemical and lipid binding characterization is prohibitive due to the number of cells that can be isolated and their limited survival in culture. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line was investigated as a model for primary cells as it exhibits the morphological and functional properties of primary cells (47Qin Z. The use of THP-1 cells as a model for mimicking the function and regulation of monocytes and macrophages in the vasculature.Atherosclerosis. 2012; 221: 2-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 48Tedesco S.

Convenience versus biological significance: Are PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells a reliable substitute for blood-derived macrophages when studying in vitro polarization?.Front. Pharmacol. 2018; 971Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were examined for their ability to be polarized into M1 and M2 phenotypes in a similar way to primary macrophages. Although the THP-1 cells polarized by LPS and IFN-γ to the M1 phenotype, and by IL-4 to the M2 phenotype, did not exhibit as strong a degree of skewing as the primary cells, they still exhibited a shift to higher CD86 and lower CD11b expression in the M1 compared with M2 macrophages consistent with the primary cells (Fig. S1, A and B). Furthermore, light microscopy images revealed the similarity of the morphological appearance of both the primary and THP-1 cells polarized into M1 macrophages with a spindle-shaped appearance or M2 macrophages with a rounded morphology (Fig. S1C). Thus, the THP-1 cells were able to be polarized to either the M1 or M2 phenotype comparable to primary macrophages. The proteoglycans secreted by primary and THP-1-derived macrophages displaying either the M1 or M2 phenotype were also examined. Both primary and THP-1 cells were cultured under conditions to induce either the M1 or M2 phenotype and the proteoglycans produced were isolated from the conditioned medium pooled from these cultures over several medium exchanges by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. S2). A comparison of chromatography elution profiles indicated that there was less protein eluted from the primary and foam cell preparations compared with the THP-1 preparations (Fig. S2A); however, when this was adjusted for the protein yield, there was no difference between primary and THP-1 preparations for the M1 and M2-polarized cells (Fig. S2B). The protein yield from the M1 and M2 THP-1 foam cell preparations was low. Mass spectrometry analyses of the proteoglycans in each of these samples revealed that the macrophages produced a range of extracellular and cell surface proteoglycans (Table 1). Interestingly, primary M1 macrophages secreted aggrecan, biglycan, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor, lumican, mimecan, perlecan, versican, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). M1 THP-1 macrophages also secreted these proteoglycans, except for versican and CSPG4. In addition, M1 THP-1 macrophages secreted agrin, syndecan-4, and serglycin, which were not expressed by the primary cells. M2 primary macrophages secreted aggrecan, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor, lumican, mimecan, perlecan, CSPG4, and serglycin. M2 THP-1 macrophages also secreted these proteoglycans, apart from biglycan, mimecan, CSPG4. In addition, M2 THP-1 macrophages secreted agrin, versican, glypican-4, and syndecan-2. Thus, there were some differences in the proteoglycan protein core expression profiles between primary and THP-1 macrophage phenotypes.Table 1M1 and M2-polarized primary and THP-1 cells differentially express proteoglycansProteinAccession numberMOWSE score (peptides identified, % sequence coverage)M1M2PrimaryTHP-1PrimaryTHP-1ExtracellularAggrecanNP_001126130 (3, 1.4)234 (7, 3.8)200 (3, 1.4)124 (2, 1.2)AgrinNP_940978715 (17, 15)1024 (17, 15)BiglycanNP_001702112 (3, 16)128 (3, 16)88 (2, 6.0)Inter-α-trypsin inhibitorHeavy chain 1NP_002206289 (3, 4.1)102 (1, 1.7)329 (5, 4.6)128 (2, 1.7)Heavy chain 2NP_002207977 (11, 6.7)263 (5, 6.6)865 (13, 12)262 (6, 7.6)Heavy chain 3NP_002208439 (8, 7.9)163 (5, 5.4)481 (6, 6.0)180 (3, 3.4)LumicanNP_002336534 (6, 17)533 (4, 14)450 (5, 14)430 (8, 21)MimecanNP_054776295 (4, 14)74 (1, 7.1)202 (4, 17)PerlecanNP_005520657 (8, 3.4)435 (6, 2.0)853 (12, 3.5)346 (7, 2.8)VersicanNP_004376108 (3, 1.1)94 (1, 0.6)Cell surfaceChondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4)NP_001888219 (5, 2.7)72 (2, 0.8)244 (6, 3.4)Glypican-4NP_001439164 (2, 9.2)Syndecan-2NP_002989261 (2, 8.5)Syndecan-4NP_00299074 (1, 8.1)IntracellularSerglycinNP_002718172 (4, 34)102 (2, 23)192 (4, 26)Proteoglycan-enriched conditioned medium from polarized primary and THP-1 cells was analyzed by peptide LC-MS2 from an in-solution tryptic digest and presented in alphabetical order and grouped into extracellular, cell surface, and intracellular proteins.

https://openalex.org/W3135151404,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory lung disease, which manifests itself in patients as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous studies have implicated alveolar-epithelial succinate in ALI protection. Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting alveolar succinate dehydrogenase SDH A would result in elevated succinate levels and concomitant lung protection. Wild-type (WT) mice or transgenic mice with targeted alveolar-epithelial Sdha or hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif1a deletion were exposed to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. Succinate metabolism was assessed in alveolar-epithelial via mass spectrometry as well as redox measurements and evaluation of lung injury. In WT mice, ALI induced by mechanical ventilation decreased SDHA activity and increased succinate in alveolar-epithelial. In vitro, cell-permeable succinate decreased epithelial inflammation during stretch injury. Mice with inducible alveolar-epithelial Sdha deletion (Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC-CreER mice) revealed reduced lung inflammation, improved alveolar barrier function, and attenuated histologic injury. Consistent with a functional role of succinate to stabilize HIF, Sdhaloxp/loxp SPC-CreER experienced enhanced Hif1a levels during hypoxia or ALI. Conversely, Hif1aloxp/loxp SPC-CreER showed increased inflammation with ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. Finally, wild-type mice treated with intra-tracheal dimethlysuccinate were protected during ALI. These data suggest that targeting alveolar-epithelial SDHA dampens ALI via succinate-mediated stabilization of HIF1A. Translational extensions of our studies implicate succinate treatment in attenuating alveolar inflammation in patients suffering from ARDS."
https://openalex.org/W3135117448,"Background Dietary diversity, a qualitative measure of dietary intake, which reflects the variety of foods consumed has been recommended to assuage nutritional problems related to insufficient micronutrients, and food insecurity. To better understand the underlying factors for poor birth outcomes in Ghana, we assessed factors associated with dietary diversity among rural and urban pregnant adolescents in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Methods As part of a larger longitudinal cohort of 416 pregnant adolescents, the FAO minimum dietary diversity for women index was used to determine the dietary diversity score (DDS) of the participants from a previous days’ 24-hour dietary recall data. The household hunger scale (HHS) and lived poverty index (LPI) were used to determine hunger and socioeconomic status. Eating behavior and socio-demographic data were gathered using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Results The mean age of the participants was 17.5 (±1.4) years with an MDD-W of 4.4 and 56% recording inadequate MDD score. More rural (63.6%) than urban dwellers (50.6%) had inadequate DDS (p = 0.008). Among all the multiple variables tests of associations on dietary diversity, only hunger status (p = 0.028) and both food aversion and poverty status (p = 0.003) had a significant effect on the adolescents’ dietary diversity. Rural dwelling adolescents (AOR = 1.7, p = 0.035, 95% CI = 1.0–2.6) recorded higher odds for inadequate DD compared with the urban respondents. Pregnant adolescents with severe hunger had higher odds (Unadjusted OR = 1.9, p = 0.053, 95% CI 1.1–3.8) for inadequate dietary diversity compared with those with no hunger. Conclusions Inadequate DD is common among pregnant adolescents in this study and is associated with rural living, food insecurity, poverty, and food craving. Livelihood support for pregnant teenagers and nutrition education are recommended interventions to improve dietary quality and limit the consequences of poor dietary diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3133746937,"Precise gene insertion or replacement in cells and animals that requires incorporation of a foreign DNA template into the genome target site by homology-directed repair (HDR) remains an inefficient process. One of the limiting factors for the inefficiency of HDR lies in the limited chance for colocalization of the donor template and target in the huge genome space. We here present a strategy to enhance HDR efficiency in animal cells by spatial and temporal colocalization of the donor and Cas9 by coupling the CRISPR system with a transcription factor (TF). We first identified that THAP domain-containing 11 (THAP11) can coordinate with CRISPR/Cas9 to increase HDR stably through screening multiple TFs from different species. We next designed donor structures with different fusion patterns with TF-specific DNA-binding motifs and found that appending two copies of THAP11-specific DNA binding motifs to both ends of the double-stranded donor DNA has an optimal effect to promote HDR. The THAP11-fused CRISPR system achieved more than twofold increase in HDR-mediated knock-in efficiency for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tagging of endogenous genes in 293T cells. We also demonstrated up to 6-fold increases of knock-in through the combinational use of the TF-fused CRISPR and valnemulin, a recently discovered small-molecule HDR enhancer. This modified CRISPR system provides a simple but highly efficient platform to facilitate CRISPR-mediated KI manipulations. Precise gene insertion or replacement in cells and animals that requires incorporation of a foreign DNA template into the genome target site by homology-directed repair (HDR) remains an inefficient process. One of the limiting factors for the inefficiency of HDR lies in the limited chance for colocalization of the donor template and target in the huge genome space.

This modified CRISPR system provides a simple but highly efficient platform to facilitate CRISPR-mediated KI manipulations. The CRISPR/Cas9-induced precise genetic modification through homology-directed repair (HDR) is a desired process in many applications, but HDR is not readily performed for its low efficiency. The strategy enhancing HDR efficiency could benefit many HDR-involved applications, such as the creation of gene knock-in (KI) animals and gene therapy for correction of genetic mutations. HDR is a DNA recombination process that repairs double-strand break using a homologous donor as the repair template, thus requires a spatial and temporal colocalization of the template and target (1Jasin M. Rothstein R. Repair of strand breaks by homologous recombination.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a012740Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that the donor searching for a homologous sequence is a key rate-limiting step for HDR occurrence because of the limited chance for coupling of the donor and target in the huge genome space. Therefore, increasing a local donor DNA concentration near the CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage site instead of allowing a randomly floating donor in the nucleoplasm could enhance the HDR frequency (2Ma M. Zhuang F. Hu X. Wang B. Wen X.Z. Ji J.F. Xi J.J.

This idea has been verified by studies using different strategies to physically position donor DNA near the cleavage site (2Ma M. Zhuang F. Hu X. Wang B. Wen X.Z. Ji J.F. Xi J.J.

In general, chemical modification of the donor DNA is required to mediate an attachment or binding between the donor and CRISPR components, such as using biotinylated donor and streptavidin-fused Cas9 protein to colocalize them (2Ma M. Zhuang F. Hu X. Wang B. Wen X.Z. Ji J.F. Xi J.J.

Assembly of CRISPR ribonucleoproteins with biotinylated oligonucleotides via an RNA aptamer for precise gene editing.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), increasing the probability of the use of the donor as a repair template. We here devised a simple system by using a nonchemically modified donor structure to colocalize donor and CRISPR components. The transcription factor (TF) controls gene transcription by binding to a specific DNA sequence, thereby can be exploited to recruit specific DNA in the presence of recognized DNA sequence (9Spitz F. Furlong E.E. Transcription factors: From enhancer binding to developmental control.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we constructed a fusion protein between Cas9 and TF DNA-binding domain (DBD) and appended the TF-recognized DNA sequence to the ends of donor to co-localize the two components in DNA repair process, with the aim to increase the HDR efficiency after CRISPR cleavage. This design is theoretically feasible, but some factors could affect its performance. For examples, is there sufficient affinity between the TF and DNA motif to realize a local enrichment of the donor DNA in the CRISPR cleavage site; how many and where are the binding motifs fused to the donor DNA; do the redesigned/fused protein and DNA structure affect the affinity and Cas9 cleavage activity? Therefore, identifying the TFs and binding motifs applicable in the CRISPR-mediated HDR system and optimizing their structures to realize an effective cooperation between them are critical. In this study, we find that a TF, THAP domain-containing 11 (THAP11), can couple with the CRISPR system to effectively enhance HDR frequency (2–3 folds) when using a TF-binding motif-appended DNA donor. We also try a combinational use of the TF-fused CRISPR and small-molecule treatment and further increase the HDR frequency to 2- to 6-folds in dependence on the cell lines and genome sites tested. A total of 8 TFs, including human-, mouse-, and pig-derived activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and THAP11, as well as yeast GAL4 and PDR1, were tested with respect to their capacity to increase HDR in animal cells. We fused DBDs of these TFs (Table 1) to the C terminal of humanized spCas9. For the donor, we used a linear dsDNA with a 200-bp left homology arm and 800-bp right homology arm to insert a T2A–enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag into the 3’ end of GAPDH gene, and two copies of TF-binding motifs were added to both ends of the dsDNA donor (Fig. 1A). The sequence information of TF-binding motifs was obtained from JASPAR 2020 (10Fornes O. Castro-Mondragon J.A. Khan A. van der Lee R. Zhang X. Richmond P.A. Modi B.P. Correard S. Gheorghe M. Baranašić D. Santana-Garcia W. Tan G. Chèneby J. Ballester B. Parcy F. et al.JASPAR 2020: Update of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: D87-D92PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 2). A predicted human ATF3 or THAP11-recognized sequence was used for all human, mouse, and pig TF orthologs. After cotransfection of Cas9–DBD/gRNA and donors harboring corresponding binding motifs, the HDR efficiency was determined by the EGFP tagging rate that successful tagging enables a fused GAPDH–EGFP expression. In all tested TFs, we found that only human- and mouse-derived THAP11 showed significant HDR-promoting effect (Fig. 1B). We further detected if different appending terminals of binding motif affect the HDR efficiency. Two copies of motifs were appended to either or both ends of dsDNA donors, and results demonstrated that a donor containing THAP11-binding motifs at both ends (LR) significantly and stably increased HDR efficiency when cotransfection with Cas9 fused with any of human, mouse, and pig THAP11–DBDs. However, the donor containing the same motifs in the right arm (R) only increased HDR in the presence of Cas9 fused with the DBD from mouse THAP11 (mTHAP11), and no effect was observed from the donor containing the motifs in left arm (L). Besides, coupled use of mouse ATF3 DBD-fused Cas9 and donor with ATF3 binding motifs at both ends also increased HDR, but the increase was not as prominent as that observed in THAP11 (Fig. 1C). We also performed Western blot to determine the EGFP levels in Cas9-mTHAP11-DBD transfection group and found the most prominent EGFP expression when using the donor with two end-appended motifs, followed by donors with motifs at the right end and then left end (Fig. 1D), in line with the HDR efficiency detected by flow cytometry in Figure 1C. All three modified versions of the donor increased EGFP expression level compared with the donor without binding motif (nonmodified control) (Fig. 1D). We next examined if increased numbers of the binding motif in the donor can increase HDR efficiency. To this purpose, we compared the donors with two and four copies of THAP11 motifs at both ends in the Cas9–mTHAP11–DBD system. Our findings showed that four copies of motifs slightly increased EGFP-positive cells compared with two copies of motifs in the donor, but the increase was insignificant (Fig. 1E). We also performed KI-specific PCR and southern blot, confirming that the EGFP-positive cells used to quantify HDR rate were all from HDR-mediated KI events without random integration of the donor into the genome (Fig. S1, A–C). These results collectively suggest that THAP11 is well applicable in the CRISPR/Cas9 system to enhance HDR, and the optimal effect can be achieved from coupled use of Cas9 fused with DBD from human THAP11 or mTHAP11 and the donor with two copies of motifs at both ends.Table 1Gene sequences of DNA-binding domains of TFs used in this studyTFsSequences of DNA-binding domainsSpeciesATF3CAGGTCTCTGCCTCGGAAGTGAGTGCTTCTGCCATCGTCCCCTGCCTGTCCCCTCCTGGGTCACTGGTGTTTGAGGATTTTGCTAACCTGACGCCCTTTGTCAAGGAAGAGCTGAGGTTTGCCATCCAGAACAAGCACCTCTGCCACCGGATGTCCTCTGCGCTGGAATCAGTCACTGTCAGCGACAGACCCCTCGGGGTGTCCATCACAAAAGCCGAGGTAGCCCCTGAAGAAGATGAAAGGAAAAAGAGGCGACGAGAAAGAAATAAGATTGCAGCTGCAAAGHomo sapiensCAACATCCAGGCCAGGTCTCTGCCTCAGAAGTCAGTGCGACCGCCATTGTCCCCTGCCTCTCACCTCCTGGGTCACTGGTATTTGAGGATTTTGCTAACCTGACACCCTTTGTCAAGGAAGAGCTGAGATTCGCCATCCAGAATAAACACCTCTGCCATCGGATGTCCTCTGCGCTGGAGTCAGTTACCGTCAACAACAGACCCCTGGAGATGTCAGTCACCAAGTCTGAGGCGGCCCCTGAAGAAGATGAGAGGAAAAGGAGGCGGCGAGAAAGAAATAAAATTGCTGCTGCCAAGMus musculusCAGGTCTCTGCCTCGGAAGTCAGTGCCTCTGCCATCGTCCCCTGCCTGTCCCCTCCTGGGTCACTGGTGTTTGAAGATTTTGCTAACCTGACACCCTTTGTCAAGGAAGAGCTGAGGTTCGCCATCCAGAACAAGCACCTCTGCCACCGGATGTCCTCGGCGCTGGAGTCGGTCACCGTCAGCGGCAGACCCCTCGAGATGTCAGTCACGAAAGCCGAGGTAGCCCCTGAAGAGGATGAAAGGAAAAAGAGGAGACGGGAAAGAAATAAGATTGCCGCCGCCAAGSus scrofaTHAP11ATGCCTGGCTTTACGTGCTGCGTGCCAGGCTGCTACAACAACTCGCACCGGGACAAGGCGCTGCACTTCTACACGTTTCCAAAGGACGCTGAGTTGCGGCGCCTCTGGCTCAAGAACGTGTCGCGTGCCGGCGTCAGTGGGTGCTTCTCCACCTTCCAGCCCACCACAGGCCACCGTCTCTGCAGCGTTCACTTCCAGGGCGGCCGCAAGACCTACACGGTACGCGTCCCCACCATCTTCCCGCTGCGCGGCGTCAATGAGCGCAAAGTAGCGCGCAGACCCGCTGGGGCCGCGGCCGCCCGCCGCAGGCAGCAGHomo sapiensATGCCTGGCTTTACGTGCTGCGTTCCGGGCTGCTACAACAATTCACACCGGGACAAGGCGCTGCACTTCTACACGTTTCCCAAGGACGCTGAGTTGCGGCGCCTCTGGCTCAAGAACGTGTCCCGTGCTGGCGTCAGTGGGTGCTTCTCCACCTTCCAACCCACCACCGGCCACCGTCTCTGCAGCGTCCACTTTCAGGGCGGCCGCAAGACCTACACGGTGCGCGTTCCCACCATTTTCCCGCTGCGTGGCGTCAATGAGCGCAAAGTAGCTCGGAGACCTGCGGGAGCTGCGGCAGCCCGCCGTAGGCAGCAGMus musculusATGCCTGGCTTTACGTGCTGCGTGCCGGGCTGCTACAACAACTCGCACCGGGATAAGGCGTTGCACTTCTACACGTTCCCCAAGGACGCTGAGCTGCGGCGCCTCTGGCTCAAGAATGTGTCCCGTGCTGGCGTCAGTGGGTGCTTCTCCACCTTCCAGCCCACCACAGGCCACCGTCTCTGCAGCGTCCACTTCCAGGGCGGCCGCAAAACCTACACCGTGCGGGTCCCCACCATCTTCCCGCTGCGCGGCGTCAACGAGCGCAAAGTAGCACGGCGACCCGCGGGGGCTGCAGCCGCCCGCCGCAGGCAGCAGSus scrofaATGCTGGCTTTACGTGCTGCGTTCCGGGCTGCTACAACAATTCACACCGGGACAAGGCGCTGCACTTCTACACGTTTCCCAAGGACGCTGAGTTGCGGCGCCTCTGGCTCAAGAACGTGTCCCGTGCTGGCGTCAGTGGGTGCTTCTCCACCTTCCAACCCACCACCGGCCACCGTCTCTGCAGCGTCCACTTTCAGGGCGGCCGCAAGACCTACACGGTGCGCGTTCCCACCATTTTCCCGCTGCGTGGCGTCAATGAGCGCAAAGTAcGCTCGGAGACCTGCGGGAGCTGCGGCAGCCCGCCGTAGGCAGCAGMus musculus (Mutant inactivated mTHAP11)GAL4ATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCGAACAAGCATGCGATATTTGCCGACTTAAAAAGCTCAAGTGCTCCAAAGAAAAACCGAAGTGCGCCAAGTGTCTGAAGAACAACTGGGAGTGTCGCTACTCTCCCAAAACCAAAAGGTCTCCGCTGACTAGGGCACATCTGACAGAAGTGGAATCAAGGCTAGAAAGACTGGAACAGCTATTTCTACTGATTTTTCCTCGAGAAGACCTTGACATGATTTTGAAAATGGATTCTTTACAGGATATAAAAGCATTGTTAACAGGATTATTTGTACAAGATSaccharomyces cerevisiaePDR1AAGCCAAGGTCGAAAGTAAGTAAAGCGTGCGATAACTGTAGAAAAAGAAAGATAAAATGTAATGGGAAGTTTCCCTGCGCAAGCTGTGAGATATATTCATGTGAGTGCACGTTCAGCACTAGACAAGGTGGCGCTCGAATASaccharomyces cerevisiaeTFs, transcription factors.

The above experiments established a reengineered Cas9 structure with HDR enhancement ability by fusion of Cas9 and THAP11–DBD. Accordingly, the donor should include two copies of THAP11-binding motifs at both ends to achieve an effective colocalization. The version of Cas9 fusion used in the following experiments is Cas9 fused with an mTHAP11-DBD-T2A-mCherry at the C terminal (Fig. 1F). mCherry can be used as the inner control to normalize the transfection efficiency to precisely quantify HDR efficiency. We also tested our system for EGFP tagging at the 3’ end of hACTB gene by HDR in 293T cells and found a 2.2-fold increase in EGFP-positive cells and 2.6-fold increase in HDR efficiency by normalization of the transfection rate compared with using unfused Cas9 and the donor (Fig. 1G). To test whether fusion with mTHAP11 affects the cleavage activity of Cas9, we used a single-strand annealing (SSA) assay to determine the targeted cleavage activity of the modified CRISPR system. The SSA reporter contains a mutant EGFP with a CRISPR cleavage site flanked by two tandem repeat sequences (Fig. 2A). Cleavage between the two repeats enables an SSA-mediated recombination to restore an intact EGFP sequence, therefore resuming the fluorescence that can be quantified by flow cytometry to report the CRISPR cleavage activity. We found that both Cas9 and Cas9-mTHAP11-DBD effectively cleaved the target site to generate the EGFP-positive cells with a similar rate (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that mTHAP11 fusion does not impair the targeted cleavage activity of Cas9. To explore the mechanism of the TF-fused CRISPR in promoting HDR, we compared the expression levels of the key factors in DNA repair pathways between Cas9 and Cas9-mTHAP11-DBD edited 293T cells. Quantitative PCR results showed that the selected NHEJ factors, KU70 and PRKDC, and HDR factors, CtIP, RAD50, and RAD51, were not differentially expressed between Cas9 and Cas9-mTHAP11-DBD edited cells, implying that Cas9-mTHAP11-DBD does not promote HDR through affecting the DNA repair pathways (Fig. 3A). Next, to examine whether TF protects the donor DNA from degradation by their affinity to promote HDR, quantification of the donor DNA in transfected 293T cells showed no significant difference between the unfused and fused CRISPR system (Fig. 3B). The total cellular donor quantity is thus not affected in the presence of the TF-fused CRISPR. We then replaced the WT mTHAP11–DBD with a mutant mTHAP11–DBD harboring a frame shift mutation in the C terminal. The mutant mTHAP11–DBD–fused CRISPR totally lost its ability in increasing HDR compared with the WT mTHAP11–DBD–fused CRISPR (Fig. 3C). To directly detect if TF fusion increases the binding between the CRISPR and donor, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to evaluate the affinity between the TF-fused CRISPR and donor. The ChIP result showed a significantly increased binding efficiency between the CRISPR and donor after mTHAP11–DBD fusion compared with the unfused CRISPR system, whereas mutant mTHAP11-DBD had no increasing effect to their binding (Fig. 3D). In addition, we can observe an obvious colocalization of Cy3-labeled donor DNA and Cas9–mTHAP11–DBD protein in the nucleus of the transfected cells through immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 3E). These collective data indicate that the TF-fused CRISPR promotes HDR efficiency mainly through promoting colocalization of the donor and the CRISPR mediated by the affinity between the TF and its binding motif. Small-molecule treatment is a simple approach to increase HDR in animal cells (11Song J. Yang D. Xu J. Zhu T. Chen Y.E. Zhang J. RS-1 enhances CRISPR/Cas9- and TALEN-mediated knock-in efficiency.Nat.

We here also tried to use small molecules to further increase HDR efficiency. Previously reported small-molecule enhancers usually have a marginal or nonidentical effect to promote HDR (15Riesenberg S. Maricic T. Targeting repair pathways with small molecules increases precise genome editing in pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Zhang J.P. Li X.L.

Efficient precise knockin with a double cut HDR donor after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated double-stranded DNA cleavage.Genome Biol. 2017; 18: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Some commonly used small-molecule HDR enhancers are also cytotoxic agents, thereby exerting a negative effect in application in cells or animals. To identify new small molecules with the HDR-promoting effect but less toxicity, our previous work screened a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug library and found a series of new HDR enhancers (unpublished data). Among them, two clinically available drugs (U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency approval), vinblastine and valnemulin, showing robust HDR-promoting effects, were further tested in the present study. Vinblastine, as a mitotic inhibitor, is a clinically important antitumor agent, and valnemulin is an antibiotic for veterinary use (17Stipkovits L. Ripley P.H. Tenk M. Glávits R. Molnár T. Fodor L. The efficacy of valnemulin (Econor) in the control of disease caused by experimental infection of calves with Mycoplasma bovis.Res. Vet. Sci. 2005; 78: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a dose-dependent assay for testing the HDR-promoting effect, vinblastine showed its maximal effect at 5 μM, while valnemulin had the similar promoting effect at the dosage range of 1 to 10 μM (Fig. 4A). Combinational use of 5-μM vinblastine and 1-μM valnemulin can additively increase HDR compared with either of them alone (Fig. 4B). Testing the cytotoxicity of the two drugs at their optimized concentrations found that valnemulin did not affect cell viability and apoptosis levels but vinblastine severely decreased cell viability and increased cell apoptosis in 293T cells, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated controls (Fig. 4, C and D). The possible effect of valnemulin on CRISPR cleavage was tested by the T7 Endonuclease I (T7E1) assay (Fig. S2A). After CRISPR transfection and valnemulin treatment in 293T cells, no significant difference was found in the CRISPR cleavage activity, shown by a similar T7E1 cleavage efficiency (Fig. S2A) and similar proportion of mutant alleles (Fig. S2B) between valnemulin treatment and control groups. To examine the combinational effect of Cas9–mTHAP11 and small molecule on increasing HDR, 293T cells were cotransfected with the CRISPR vector containing Cas9–mTHAP11 and gRNAs and donors for EGFP tagging at GAPDH/ACTB, and then treated with 1-μM valnemulin for 48 h. Analyzing HDR efficiency through flow cytometry found that the use of Cas9–mTHAP11 increased HDR efficiency 4 and 2 times greater at GAPDH and ACTB loci, respectively, compared with Cas9 transfection (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, valnemulin treatment had additional 0.4- and 1.6-fold increased efficiency for the two loci (Fig. 5, A and B), indicating an additional benefit for enhancement of HDR in the TF-fused CRISPR system. We also tested the combination of Cas9–mTHAP11 and valnemulin in other cell lines and found great increase in HDR efficiency. By testing in the EGFP tagging system at GAPDH and ACTB loci, approximately 2- and 1.6-fold increased HDR efficiency was found in HeLa cells (Fig. 5C), and approximately 4-fold increase for both loci was achieved in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5D). These HDR-promoting effects were greatly higher than using either of Cas9–mTHAP11 or valnemulin alone. Increasing local concentration of donor DNA at the CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage site is a feasible way to promote CRISPR/Cas9–mediated HDR efficiency. Some recent works have achieved significantly increased HDR in animal cells and embryos via multiple similar approaches (2Ma M. Zhuang F. Hu X. Wang B. Wen X.Z. Ji J.F. Xi J.J.

Commun. 2017; 8: 1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For examples, using an avidin-fused Cas9 to recruit biotin-modified single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor (500- to 800-nt fragments flanked by 100-nt homology arms) showed 15 to 22% KI efficiency in mouse embryos, whereas no KI editing was observed in all tested genes for the unmodified CRISPR and donor system (2Ma M. Zhuang F. Hu X. Wang B. Wen X.Z. Ji J.F. Xi J.J. Efficient generation of mice carrying homozygous double-floxp alleles using the Cas9-avidin/biotin-donor DNA system.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar avidin–biotin conjugation strategy achieved 43 to 95% KI efficiency for large-fragment dsDNA KI in two cell–stage mouse embryos, compared with 11.2 to 43.2% KI efficiency when using the unmodified CRISPR system (6Gu B. Posfai E. Rossant J. Efficient generation of targeted large insertions by microinjection into two-cell-stage mouse embryos.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Ling et al. developed a chemically modified Cas9 protein containing azide-containing noncanonical amino acid, which allows conjugation of dibenzylcyclooctyne (DBCO)-containing donor DNA by means of strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition, thereby recruiting the donor template to the cleavage complex. Cotransfection of noncanonical amino acid–modified Cas9–gRNA ribonucleoprotein and DBCO-modified ssODN had a 1.6-fold HDR increase as compared with unmodified groups in 293 cells. When using a DBCO-modified DNA adaptor to tether unmodified donor ssODN by base pairing, modified ribonucleoprotein–adaptor conjugates increased HDR efficiency approximately 5-fold as compared with unmodified or scramble adapters (7Ling X. Xie B. Gao X. Chang L. Zheng W. Chen H. Huang Y. Tan L. Li M. Liu T. Improving the efficiency of precise genome editing with site-specific Cas9-oligonucleotide conjugates.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eaaz0051Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These studies confirm that methods copositioning the CRISPR cleavage complex and donor template can induce a notable increase in HDR efficiency. Based on the similar strategy, we colocalized the CRISPR and donor by utilizing the affinity between the TF and its binding motif. We screened multiple pairs of TFs and binding motifs and found that THAP11 of different species origin in fusion with Cas9 protein all increased CRISPR-mediated HDR. The best promoting effect can be achieved in cotransfection of THAP11 DBD-fused Cas9 and dsDNA donor tagged with two tandem copies of the binding motif at both ends. However, the donor tagged with just one-end binding motif did not significantly increase HDR efficiency, implying that increased numbers of binding motifs at the donor increase affinity between the donor and TF-fused Cas9. Among the other tested TFs, mATF3 also had tendency to increase HDR, but yeast-derived TFs, PD"
https://openalex.org/W3133870700,"Introduction Delayed graft function (DGF) following renal transplantation is a manifestation of acute kidney injury (AKI) leading to poor long-term outcome. Current treatments have limited effectiveness in preventing DGF. Interleukin-18 (IL18), a biomarker of AKI, induces interferon-γ expression and immune activation. GSK1070806, an anti-IL18 monoclonal antibody, neutralizes activated (mature) IL18 released from damaged cells following inflammasome activation. This phase IIa, single-arm trial assessed the effect of a single dose of GSK1070806 on DGF occurrence post donation after circulatory death (DCD) kidney transplantation. Methods The 3 mg/kg intravenous dose was selected based on prior studies and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, indicating the high likelihood of a rapid and high level of IL18 target engagement when administered prior to kidney allograft reperfusion. Utilization of a Bayesian sequential design with a background standard-of-care DGF rate of 50% based on literature, and confirmed via extensive registry data analyses, enabled a statistical efficacy assessment with a minimal sample size. The primary endpoint was DGF frequency, defined as dialysis requirement ≤7 days post transplantation (except for hyperkalemia). Secondary endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. Results GSK1070806 administration was associated with IL18-GSK1070806 complex detection and increased total serum IL18 levels due to IL18 half-life prolongation induced by GSK1070806 binding. Interferon-γ−induced chemokine levels declined or remained unchanged in most patients. Although the study was concluded prior to the Bayesian-defined stopping point, 4/7 enrolled patients (57%) had DGF, exceeding the 50% standard-of-care rate, and an additional two patients, although not reaching the protocol-defined DGF definition, demonstrated poor graft function. Six of seven patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), including two treatment-related SAEs. Conclusion Overall, using a Bayesian design and extensive PBPK dose modeling with only a small sample size, it was deemed unlikely that GSK1070806 would be efficacious in preventing DGF in the enrolled DCD transplant population.

These areas of ectopic ileal metaplasia, positive for Paneth cell (PC) markers are consistent with diagnosis of CC. Retrospectively, we: 1. Identified 21 patients with indeterminate colitis (IC) between 2000-2007 and were reevaluation their final clinical diagnosis in 2014 after a followed-up for mean 8.7±3.7 (range, 4-14) years. Their initial biopsies were analyzed by DEFA5 bioassay. 2. Differentiated ulcer-associated cell lineage (UACL) analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the CC patients, stained for Mucin 6 (MUC6) and DEFA5. 3. Treated human immortalized colonic epithelial cells (NCM460) and colonoids with pure DEFA5 on the secretion of signatures after 24hr. The control colonoids were not treated. 4. Treated colonoids with/without enterotoxins for 14 days and the spent medium were collected and determined by quantitative expression of DEFA5, CCLCs and other biologic signatures. The experiments were repeated twice. Three statistical methods were used: (i) Univariate analysis; (ii) LASSO; and (iii) Elastic net. DEFA5 bioassay discriminated CC and ulcerative colitis (UC) in a cohort of IC patients with accuracy. A fit logistic model with group CC and UC as the outcome and the DEFA5 as independent variable differentiator with a positive predictive value of 96 percent. IHC staining of CC for MUC6 and DEFA5 stained in different locations indicating that DEFA5 is not co-expressed in UACL and is therefore NOT the genesis of CC, rather a secretagogue for specific signature(s) that underlie the distinct crypt pathobiology of CC. Notably, we observed expansion of signatures after DEFA5 treatment on NCM460 and colonoids cells expressed at different times, intervals, and intensity. These factors are key stem cell niche regulators leading to DEFA5 secreting CCLCs differentiation 'the colonic ectopy ileal metaplasia formation' conspicuously of pathogenic importance in CC."
https://openalex.org/W3133876611,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through activation of G proteins and subsequent modulation of downstream effectors. More recently, signaling mediated by β-arrestin has also been implicated in important physiological functions. This has led to great interest in the identification of biased ligands that favor either G protein or β-arrestin-signaling pathways. However, nearly all screening techniques for measuring β-arrestin recruitment have required C-terminal receptor modifications that can in principle alter protein interactions and thus signaling. Here, we have developed a novel luminescence-based assay to measure β-arrestin recruitment to the membrane or early endosomes by unmodified receptors. Our strategy uses NanoLuc, an engineered luciferase from Oplophorus gracilirostris (deep-sea shrimp) that is smaller and brighter than other well-established luciferases. Recently, several publications have explored functional NanoLuc split sites for use in complementation assays. We have identified a unique split site within NanoLuc and fused the corresponding N-terminal fragment to either a plasma membrane or early endosome tether and the C-terminal fragment to β-arrestins, which form the basis for the MeNArC and EeNArC assays, respectively. Upon receptor activation, β-arrestin is recruited to the membrane and subsequently internalized in an agonist concentration-dependent manner. This recruitment promotes complementation of the two NanoLuc fragments, thereby reconstituting functional NanoLuc, allowing for quantification of β-arrestin recruitment with a single luminescence signal. Our assay avoids potential artifacts related to C-terminal receptor modification and has promise as a new generic assay for measuring β-arrestin recruitment to diverse GPCR types in heterologous or native cells.

Our assay avoids potential artifacts related to C-terminal receptor modification and has promise as a new generic assay for measuring β-arrestin recruitment to diverse GPCR types in heterologous or native cells. Over the past decade, increased attention has been directed to biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the possibility of identifying ligands that can selectively target either G protein- or β-arrestin-mediated signaling. As an example, the β-adrenergic receptor ligand carvedilol antagonizes G protein activation but recruits β-arrestin and has been shown to increase survival rates in patients suffering from heart failure (1Wisler J.W. DeWire S.M. Whalen E.J. Violin J.D. Drake M.T. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. A unique mechanism of beta-blocker action: Carvedilol stimulates beta-arrestin signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 16657-16662Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). At the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), G protein signaling has been proposed to be primarily responsible for analgesia, with side effects such as respiratory depression resulting from β-arrestin-mediated signaling (2Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Enhanced morphine analgesia in mice lacking beta-arrestin 2.Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 3Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Differential mechanisms of morphine antinociceptive tolerance revealed in (beta)arrestin-2 knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10494-10500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although this paradigm has recently been challenged (4Kliewer A. Schmiedel F. Sianati S. Bailey A. Bateman J.T. Levitt E.S.

Pharmacol. 2020; 177: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that β-arrestin recruitment to the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) in indirect pathway neurons in the ventral striatum leads to enhanced locomotion, whereas G protein signaling is necessary for incentive behavior (7Donthamsetti P. Gallo E.F. Buck D.C. Stahl E.L. Zhu Y. Lane J.R. Bohn L.M. Neve K.A. Kellendonk C. Javitch J.A. Arrestin recruitment to dopamine D2 receptor mediates locomotion but not incentive motivation.Mol. Psychiatry. 2020; 25: 2086-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), further emphasizing the potential importance of biased signaling in more targeted therapeutics. Agonist induced-GPCR activation leads to GPCR kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, most notably in the C-terminal tail of receptors but also in the intracellular loops of some receptors, which are the primary receptor recognition regions for β-arrestin binding. In addition to its role in signaling, β-arrestin also regulates receptor internalization and for some receptors stays bound to endosomes where receptor-mediated signaling may continue to occur (8Irannejad R. von Zastrow M. GPCR signaling along the endocytic pathway.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 27: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The most well-established techniques to investigate β-arrestin recruitment are the PathHunter, Tango, LinkLight, and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays. The PathHunter assay is an enzyme complementation assay in which split enzyme fragments are fused to the receptor and to β-arrestin and complementation of the functional enzyme creates a chemiluminescence readout (9Zhao X. Jones A. Olson K.R. Peng K. Wehrman T. Park A. Mallari R. Nebalasca D. Young S.W. Xiao S.-H. A homogeneous enzyme fragment complementation-based beta-arrestin translocation assay for high-throughput screening of G-protein-coupled receptors.J. Biomol. Screen. 2008; 13: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Tango-GPCR assay is a reporter gene assay where a transcription factor fused to the receptor C terminus is cleaved off by a protease-tagged β-arrestin, leading to the expression of a reporter that creates a luminescence readout (10Barnea G. Strapps W. Herrada G. Berman Y. Ong J. Kloss B. Axel R. Lee K.J. The genetic design of signaling cascades to record receptor activation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 11Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.-P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). LinkLight uses a modified luciferase attached to β-arrestin that is cleaved off by a protease fused to the C terminus of the GPCR of interest, thereby activating the luciferase and producing light (12Eishingdrelo H. Cai J. Weissensee P. Sharma P. Tocci M.J. Wright P.S. A cell-based protein-protein interaction method using a permuted luciferase reporter.Curr. Chem. Genomics. 2011; 5: 122-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BRET between a receptor fused at its C terminus to a luciferase donor and β-arrestin tagged with fluorescent protein acceptor is also commonly used to measure β-arrestin recruitment (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, all of these β-arrestin assays require that fusion tags be directly attached to the C terminus of receptors of interest, which could alter GRK, arrestin, or other protein interactions with the receptors and therefore impact signaling. The only method that does not rely on modified receptors is the microscopy-based Transfluor assay where β-arrestin fused to a fluorescent protein is visualized at the membrane (14Oakley R.H. Hudson C.C. Cruickshank R.D. Meyers D.M. Payne R.E. Rhem S.M. Loomis C.R. The cellular distribution of fluorescently labeled arrestins provides a robust, sensitive, and universal assay for screening G protein-coupled receptors.Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2002; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, with this technique, it is difficult to quantify ligand efficacy and potency or to scale for screening ligands. In contrast, we previously introduced a modified BRET assay in which a Renilla luciferase 8 (RLuc8) donor is anchored to the membrane instead of attached to the receptor (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this assay, which is based on “bystander” BRET, β-arrestin fused to a venus acceptor is translocated from the cytosol to the unmodified receptor at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in BRET by proximity between the membrane-anchored donor and acceptor attached to β-arrestin. This assay incorporated yeast-derived “helper” peptides that are attached to the donor and acceptor, thereby enhancing the affinity of the interaction between β-arrestin and the plasma-membrane anchor (15Grünberg R. Burnier J.V. Ferrar T. Beltran-Sastre V. Stricher F. van der Sloot A.M. Garcia-Olivas R. Mallabiabarrena A. Sanjuan X. Zimmermann T. Serrano L. Engineering of weak helper interactions for high-efficiency FRET probes.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This bystander BRET format was later adapted to a BRET2 format (16Namkung Y. Le Gouill C. Lukashova V. Kobayashi H. Hogue M. Khoury E. Song M. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Monitoring G protein-coupled receptor and β-arrestin trafficking in live cells using enhanced bystander BRET.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12178Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). BRET assays require a specialized dual output microplate reader and filter sets compatible with BRET. The previously used BRET assays also (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) use RLuc8 instead of the more recently reported novel luciferase NanoLuc developed by Promega, which has the advantages of being smaller and significantly brighter compared with other known luciferases (17Laschet C. Dupuis N. Hanson J. A dynamic and screening-compatible nanoluciferase-based complementation assay enables profiling of individual GPCR-G protein interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 4079-4090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, a split NanoLuc, known as NanoBiT, which is commercially available from Promega (Fig. S1A), has been used successfully in a direct β-arrestin recruitment assay in which a small peptide fragment, referred to as SmBiT, is attached to the receptor of interest and the larger fragment, referred to as LgBiT, is attached to β-arrestin (18Hall M.P. Unch J. Binkowski B.F. Valley M.P. Butler B.L. Wood M.G. Otto P. Zimmerman K. Vidugiris G. Machleidt T. Robers M.B. Benink H.A. Eggers C.T. Slater M.R. Meisenheimer P.L. et al.Engineered luciferase reporter from a deep sea shrimp utilizing a novel imidazopyrazinone substrate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1848-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). A slightly modified version of NanoBiT has proven to be effective for compound library screening as seen in a direct recruitment assay between D2R and Gαi1/o (19Dixon A.S. Schwinn M.K. Hall M.P. Zimmerman K. Otto P. Lubben T.H. Butler B.L. Binkowski B.F. Machleidt T. Kirkland T.A. Wood M.G. Eggers C.T. Encell L.P. Wood K.V. Nanoluc complementation reporter optimized for accurate measurement of protein interactions in cells.ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Thus, we expected that the NanoBiT system would readily be adapted to our bystander assay (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by fusing SmBiT to our membrane anchor instead of directly to the receptor and LgBiT to β-arrestin, thereby substituting BRET in our assay with complemented NanoLuc detection. However, to our surprise, the NanoBiT adaptation of our assay failed to detect β-arrestin recruitment to the membrane upon receptor activation. Here, we report a novel NanoLuc split that, unlike NanoBiT, is suitable for the desired NanoLuc-complementation-based β-arrestin membrane recruitment assay where the membrane anchor is attached to the N-terminal NanoLuc fragment (referred to as MeN) and β-arrestin is attached to the C-terminal NanoLuc fragment (referred to as ArC). Our assay, which we refer to as MeNArC, does not rely on receptor modification or helper peptides and provides a simple luminescence output reading of β-arrestin recruitment as an alternative to the bystander BRET assay to investigate receptors in a more native format. We also adapted the assay to measure β-arrestin recruitment to early endosomes, referred to as EeNArC, demonstrating that the assay can detect events in specific cell compartments other than the plasma membrane. We anticipate that these novel assays will serve as general approaches to screen compounds for β-arrestin recruitment to unmodified GPCRs in vitro and potentially in vivo. As described above, we initially used the NanoBiT system (Fig. S1A) in our previously developed assay (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) to detect membrane recruitment of β-arrestin. However, the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), D2R, and AT1R all failed to produce any increase in luminescence in this assay upon agonist stimulation (Fig. S1B). We reasoned that the nature of the NanoBiT split (Fig. S1A) might prevent proper complementation when used in our bystander membrane recruitment assay and therefore designed a new split site within NanoLuc using the crystal structure of the protein as a guide (20Tomabechi Y. Hosoya T. Ehara H. Sekine S.-I. Shirouzu M. Inouye S. Crystal structure of nanoKAZ: The mutated 19 kDa component of Oplophorus luciferase catalyzing the bioluminescent reaction with coelenterazine.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2016; 470: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We selected a site in a loop region that divides NanoLuc into two almost equally sized fragments (N-terminal fragment, amino acids 1–102; C-terminal fragment, amino acids 103–172), without disrupting any secondary structural element, in an effort to select fragments that would fold independently and that could efficiently compliment when brought together at the membrane (Fig. 1, A and B). This site was similar but not identical to another NanoLuc split site used previously in a direct-recruitment assay (21Yano H. Cai N.S. Javitch J.A. Ferré S. Luciferase complementation based-detection of G-protein-coupled receptor activity.BioTechniques. 2018; 65: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To verify that our split fragments can form a fully functional protein capable of luminescence when complemented, we first attached the N- and C-terminal NanoLuc fragments to FKBP (FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein) and FRB (FKBP-rapamycin-binding domain) respectively, which can readily dimerize with high affinity upon addition of rapamycin (Fig. 1C) (22Chiu M.I. Katz H. Berlin V. RAPT1, a mammalian homolog of yeast Tor, interacts with the FKBP12/rapamycin complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12574-12578Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). When transfected alone, the fragments did not yield any luminescence over the baseline observed with mock transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Cotransfection of both fragments yielded a small basal luminescence signal that was increased ∼30-fold by the addition of rapamycin (Fig. 1D), suggesting only minimal spontaneous assembly of the fragments but efficient complementation when brought into proximity, demonstrating that the new fragments are suitable as a tool for complementation assays. We further validated their use for complementation-based GPCR assays in a direct recruitment assay with β-arrestin, as we have done previously with the D2R receptor in a BRET setup (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in which the N-terminal Nanoluc fragment was attached to the C-terminal tail of D2R and the C-terminal fragment was fused to the N terminus of β-arrestin2 (Fig. 1E). In this configuration, the endogenous agonist dopamine produced a time- and dose-dependent increase in luminescence (Fig. 1F). We next incorporated the validated NanoLuc split components into our β-arrestin recruitment assay with unmodified receptors where the N-terminal fragment of NanoLuc is anchored to the plasma membrane through a double palmitoylated domain of GAP43 (MeN) and where the C-terminal fragment is fused to the N terminus of β-arrestin1 or β-arrestin2 (ArC) (Fig. 2A). The helper peptides that were used in our original BRET assay were not used in the current split Nanoluc configuration (13Donthamsetti P. Quejada J.R. Javitch J.A. Gurevich V.V. Lambert N.A. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to characterize agonist-induced arrestin recruitment to modified and unmodified G protein-coupled receptors.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2015; 70: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To test our MeNArC assay, we used D2R and MOR, which are prototypical class A receptors based on their agonist-induced β-arrestin-binding profile after internalization (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Differential affinities of visual arrestin, beta arrestin1, and beta arrestin2 for G protein-coupled receptors delineate two major classes of receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), as β-arrestin readily dissociates from these receptors upon receptor endocytosis. When D2R was used in this assay, in contrast to the results when the NanoBiT fragments were used (Fig. S1B), we observed a robust increase in luminescence upon agonist treatment that plateaued after ∼40 min (Fig. 2B), consistent with β-arrestin recruitment to the plasma membrane. Addition of the D2R antagonist sulpiride 18 min after receptor stimulation with the agonist quinpirole led to a strong decay in luminescence down to baseline (Fig. 2B), indicative of nearly complete reversal of complementation between the NanoLuc fragments upon receptor inhibition, suggesting that the affinity between the fragments is relatively low. Both β-arrestin isoforms in the assay gave similar fold increases of 3.1 ± 0.14 and 3.4 ± 0.20 for β-arrestin1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D), with similar potencies (β-arrestin1 EC50 156 nM ± 0.16; β-arrestin2 EC50 74 nM ± 0.18). While the MeNArC assay also can be used with the splits in the reverse orientation, we observed a lower fold increase in luminescence upon receptor activation (Fig. S2), and therefore we used the assay in the preferred orientation described above for all subsequent experiments. For further study of the assay, we proceeded with β-arrestin2, which is the β-arrestin isoform most typically used in β-arrestin assay development. To assess the MeNArC assay’s dynamic range, we tested D2R with the high-efficacy partial agonist quinpirole, medium-efficacy partial agonists bromocriptine and terguride, and the low-efficacy partial agonist (3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-propylpiperidine (PPP), giving an efficacy compared with dopamine of 78%, 46%, 24%, and 10%, respectively, similar to previously published data using the BRET direct recruitment assay (24Klewe I.V. Nielsen S.M. Tarpø L. Urizar E. Dipace C. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Egebjerg J. Christensen K.V. Recruitment of beta-arrestin2 to the dopamine D2 receptor: Insights into anti-psychotic and anti-parkinsonian drug receptor signaling.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results show that the MeNArC assay is also capable of measuring different degrees of partial agonism of unmodified receptors (Fig. 2E). To further validate the MeNArC assay, we also tested MOR compared with a previously reported MOR mutant (MOR 11S/T-A) with impaired β-arrestin binding (25Miess E. Gondin A.B. Yousuf A. Steinborn R. Mösslein N. Yang Y. Göldner M. Ruland J.G. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Christie M.J. Halls M.L. Schulz S. Canals M. Multisite phosphorylation is required for sustained interaction with GRKs and arrestins during rapid μ-opioid receptor desensitization.Sci. Signal. 2018; 11eaas9609Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In MOR 11S/T-A, 11 serine and threonine residues in the C-terminal tail of the receptor are replaced with alanine, preventing C-terminal phosphorylation and therefore inhibiting recruitment of β-arrestin. The fold change of MOR compared with MOR 11S/T-A in response to activation by DAMGO ([D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin) was 3.7 ± 0.10 and 2.4 ± 0.11, respectively (Fig. 2F), decreasing the efficacy to 65% for MOR 11S/T-A. Previously, MOR 11S/T-A had been tested in a direct recruitment assay giving an efficacy of 42% compared with WT. In both assays the MOR 11S/T-A mutant exhibits decreased efficacy, demonstrating that our complementation assay can differentiate between receptors with known differences in β-arrestin recruitment and that the assay is sensitive to the receptor’s affinity for β-arrestin. These experiments verify the system’s direct link between β-arrestin recruitment and the luminescence signal. To investigate the versatility of the MeNArC assay, we further tested its use with the class B angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Unlike class A receptors, AT1R and other class B receptors bind β-arrestin with higher affinity and form longer-lived complexes that persist after endocytosis (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Differential affinities of visual arrestin, beta arrestin1, and beta arrestin2 for G protein-coupled receptors delineate two major classes of receptors.J. Biol.

AT1R led to a robust increase in luminescence upon stimulation with the agonist Angiotensin II (Ang II) with a fold change of 3.0 ± 0.12 (Fig. 3A). The addition of sucrose, a known inhibitor of receptor endocytosis (26Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. Hypertonic media inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis by blocking clathrin-coated pit formation.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), had no effect on agonist response, suggesting that the observed signal is generated at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). To investigate the reversibility of β-arrestin recruitment to a class B receptor, we tested AT1R with the antagonist olmesartan. Interestingly, agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment by AT1R could not be reversed upon subsequent addition of increasing concentrations of olmesartan, either in the absence or presence of sucrose (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the class A receptor D2R was inhibited by antagonist in the same assay (Fig. 2B), showing the reversibility of activation. Notably, we were able to prevent the agonist-induced response at AT1R with olmesartan treatment when the antagonist was added before agonist (Fig. 3B). To understand whether this was due to rapid internalization of AT1R-β-arrestin complexes that might become inaccessible to inhibition by olmesartan, we inhibited internalization with sucrose, but this did not enhance olmesartan’s ability to inhibit the agonist-induced response (Fig. 3B). We therefore reasoned that this irreversibility reflects the much higher affinity of β-arrestin interaction with AT1R once the receptor C tail is phosphorylated and engaged with β-arrestin (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Differential affinities of visual arrestin, beta arrestin1, and beta arrestin2 for G protein-coupled receptors delineate two major classes of receptors.J.

Like what is reported for the beta 2 adrenergic receptor-V2R chimera, we infer that even after blocking core engagement of AT1R with β-arrestin by addition of the antagonist, the “hanging” interaction with the phosphorylated receptor C tail is sufficient to maintain the interaction (27Shukla A.K. Westfield G.H. Xiao K. Reis R.I. Huang L.-Y. Tripathi-Shukla P. Qian J. Li S. Blanc A. Oleskie A.N. Dosey A.M. Su M. Liang C.-R. Gu L.-L.

Because class B receptors form long-lived complexes with β-arrestin that can be imaged after internalization (23Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S.

For this assay, referred to as EeNArC, the ArC component described above is coexpressed with the N-terminal NanoLuc fragment attached to the FYVE domain of endofin (EeN), which was shown previously to selectively bind endosomes and used in a direct receptor recruitment assay (16Namkung Y.

Stimulation of the receptors with Ang II resulted in a robust increase in luminescence over time that reached a plateau after 60 min, with an EC50 of 1.6 nM ± 0.22, consistent with β-arrestin recruitment to early endosomes (Fig. 3D). As expected, the agonist effect was dramatically blunted by sucrose for the EeNArC assay (Fig. 3, D and E), but not for the MeNArC assay (Fig. 3B), demonstrating that the former is specific to events that occur at early endosomes and thus dependent on internalization (Fig. 3, D and E). The MeNArC and EeNArC assays were also performed in human embryonic kidney (Hek)293 cells without cotransfection of any receptor, and no response was observed for dopamine, Ang II, or DAMGO, establishing the specificity of the assay for the transfected GPCRs (Fig. S3).

However, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity remains a major challenge. Here, we measured memory-sensitive oscillations using intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the temporal cortex of patients performing an episodic memory task. When these patients subsequently underwent resection, we employed transcriptomics on the temporal cortex to link gene expression with brain oscillations and identified genes correlated with oscillatory signatures of memory formation across six frequency bands. A co-expression analysis isolated oscillatory signature-specific modules associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and ion channel activity, with highly correlated genes exhibiting strong connectivity within these modules. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we further revealed that these modules are enriched for specific classes of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of highly correlated genes. This unprecedented dataset of patient-specific brain oscillations coupled to genomics unlocks new insights into the genetic mechanisms that support memory encoding."

https://openalex.org/W3135639623,"Background Histological evaluation of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients has been debated ever since the first description of the disease and its role in follow-up has never been fully established. Recent evidence suggests an added benefit in accuracy when evaluating if the patient is in remission. Unfortunately, there are several different histological indices, and it is difficult to compare outcomes where different scores are applied. Histopathological evaluation is prone to subjective biases, despite the use of indices. In addition, these indices are developed by expert IBD pathologist, but applied at large, by general pathologist. Therefore, we evaluated the three most applied histological indices for UC on samples from patients in remission to compare test qualities and estimate their usefulness to identify remission by both general and GI specialized pathologist. Method Mucosal biopsies from 41 UC patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were collected as part of a larger study on UC. Three pathologists blinded to the patients’ clinical status evaluated them using Geboes score (GS), Nancy Index (NI) and Robarts Histopathological Index (RHI). We calculated the agreement between the pathologists using Inter-class correlation (ICC) and visualized it with ICC-plots and Bland-Altman plots. Association between clinical factors and histological category were analysed by Fisher’s exact test. Results The ICC value for GS, RHI and NI were 0.85, 0.73 and 0.70 respectively. The limits of agreement were ±6.1, ±4.0 and ±1.4, for GS, RHI and NI, respectively. Mayo endoscopic subgrade and UC clinical score did not show association with any histological scores. Despite clinical and endoscopic remission 7–35% of the patients displayed histological inflammation on a level classified as active disease, depending on the index and cut-off. Conclusion A substantial amount of UC patients in clinical and endoscopic remission display inflammation on a histological level, but the ability to classify these patients accurately and consistently could be improved."

From a low-dose hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp with glucose-tracer, hepatic IS was assessed by rates of basal and suppressed glucose appearance (Ra), a measure of endogenous glucose production (EGP), and the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIR). Total IS was assessed by rates of glucose infusion (GIR), disappearance (Rd), and metabolic clearance (MCR). From a meal test we assessed IS by the Matsuda index and glucose tolerance by glucose and insulin measurements in the fasted state and postprandially for 2.5 h. The meal test was performed in 97 healthy individuals with BMI ≥35 in similar-sized risk-allele groups (n = 32 T/T, 31 A/T, and 34 A/A), and 79 of them performed the clamp. We analyzed outcomes separately for males and females, and adjusted glucose Ra, Rd, MCR, GIR, and HIR for fat mass. We did not find genotype effects on EGP. Among males, genotype A/A was associated with a significantly lower glucose Rd, MCR, and Matsuda index score relative to genotype T/T. Glucose tolerance was significantly lower in males with genotype A/T vs. T/T and A/A. For females, there were no genotype effects on hepatic or total IS, or on glucose tolerance. Independently of genotypes, females displayed a significantly better hepatic and total IS, and better glucose tolerance than males. We conclude that in subjects with similar obesity we did not register any FTO risk-allele effect on hepatic IS. A FTO risk-allele effect on total IS was registered in males only, findings which need to be reproduced in further studies. Results confirm marked differences in IS between the biological sexes and extend present knowledge by demonstrating a lower endogenous glucose production in females vs. males in uniformly obese individuals."

In contrast, little is known about exo-β-N-acetylmuramidases, which catalyze an exo-lytic cleavage of β-1,4-MurNAc entities from the non-reducing ends of peptidoglycan chains. Such an enzyme was identified earlier in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, but the corresponding gene has remained unknown so far. We now report that ybbC of B. subtilis, renamed namZ, encodes the reported exo-β-N-acetylmuramidase. A ΔnamZ mutant accumulated specific cell wall fragments and showed growth defects under starvation conditions, indicating a role of NamZ in cell wall turnover and recycling. Recombinant NamZ protein specifically hydrolyzed the artificial substrate para-nitrophenyl β-MurNAc and the peptidoglycan-derived disaccharide MurNAc-β-1,4-GlcNAc. Together with the exo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase NagZ and the exo-muramoyl-l-alanine amidase AmiE, NamZ degraded intact peptidoglycan by sequential hydrolysis from the non-reducing ends. A structure model of NamZ, built on the basis of two crystal structures of putative orthologs from Bacteroides fragilis, revealed a two-domain structure including a Rossmann-fold-like domain that constitutes a unique glycosidase fold. Thus, NamZ, a member of the DUF1343 protein family of unknown function, is now classified as the founding member of a new family of glycosidases (CAZy GH171; www.cazy.org/GH171.html).

https://openalex.org/W3134763180,"How organisms are able to maintain robust homeostasis has in recent years received increased attention by the use of combined control engineering and kinetic concepts, which led to the discovery of robust controller motifs. While these motifs employ kinetic conditions showing integral feedback and homeostasis for step-wise perturbations, the motifs’ performance differ significantly when exposing them to time dependent perturbations. One type of controller motifs which are able to handle exponentially and even hyperbolically growing perturbations are based on derepression. In these controllers the compensatory reaction, which neutralizes the perturbation, is derepressed, i.e. its reaction rate is increased by the decrease of an inhibitor acting on the compensatory flux. While controllers in this category can deal well with different time-dependent perturbations they have the disadvantage that they break down once the concentration of the regulatory inhibitor becomes too low and the compensatory flux has gained its maximum value. We wondered whether it would be possible to bypass this restriction, while still keeping the advantages of derepression kinetics. In this paper we show how the inclusion of multisite inhibition and the presence of positive feedback loops lead to an amplified controller which is still based on derepression kinetics but without showing the breakdown due to low inhibitor concentrations. By searching for the amplified feedback motif in natural systems, we found it as a part of the plant circadian clock where it is highly interlocked with other feedback loops."

Since both extremely low and high levels of C-section can not only cause adverse birth outcomes but also impose a double burden of inefficiency within maternal health care, it is important to monitor the dynamics of key factors associated with the use of C-section. Objectives To examine the association between type of provider and C-section in India in three-time points: 1999, 2006, and 2016, and also to assess whether this association differed across maternal education and wealth level. Methods Data were from three waves of cross-sectional and nationally representative Indian National Health Family Survey: Wave II (1999), III (2006), and IV (2016). Target population is women aged 15 and 49 who had an institutional delivery for the most recent live birth during the three or five years preceding the survey (depending on the survey round). Multivariate logistic regression models adjusting for state cluster effect were performed to determine the association between the type of providers and C-section. Differential association between the type of providers and C-section by maternal education and wealth level was examined by stratified analyses. Results The prevalence of C-section among institutional delivery increased from 20.5% in 1999 to 24.8% in 2006 while it declined to 19.4% in 2016. The positive association between private providers and C-section became stronger over the study period (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.39, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.18–1.64 in 1999, OR = 3.71 95% CI 2.93–4.70 in 2016). The association was consistently significant across all states in 2016. The gap in C-section between public and private providers was greater among less-educated and poorer women. The ORs gradually increased from the poorest to the richest quintiles, and also from the least educated group (no formal education) to the most educated group (college graduate or above) Conclusions Our results suggest that disparity in C-section between private and public providers has increased over the last 15 years and was higher in lower SES women. The behavior of providers needs to be closely monitored to ensure that C-section is performed only when medically justified."
https://openalex.org/W3135831801,"Relationship closeness promotes desirable health outcomes. Most interventions to increase relationship closeness are verbal, which may not suit all couples. We consider whether Orgasmic Meditation (OM), a structured, partnered, largely non-verbal practice that includes genital touch, also increases relationship closeness. We hypothesized that OM would increase feelings of closeness for both romantic and non-romantic partners. This is important, because intimate touch with non-romantic partners is commonly considered deleterious by clinicians, which may inadvertently increase feelings of shame. Dyads (n = 125) reported their feelings of closeness before and after OM. Approximately half of the participants were romantic partners, while the other half only engaged in OM together (non-romantic). Closeness after OM increased on average across participants. Non-romantic dyads increased self-other overlap more than romantic dyads. These data support that a partnered, largely non-verbal practice is associated with increased feelings of closeness in the moment, including for individuals who are not in a romantic relationship."

The quantification of deaths can be considered a measure of the effectiveness of hospital intervention, and a high percentage of hospital discharges due to death can be associated with deficiencies in the quality of hospital care. Objective To determine the overall percentage of hospital discharges due to death in a Mexican tertiary care hospital from its opening, to describe the characteristics of the time series generated from the monthly percentage of hospital discharges due to death and to make and evaluate predictions. Methods This was a retrospective study involving the medical records of 81,083 patients who were discharged from a tertiary care hospital from April 2007 to December 2019 (first 153 months of operation). The records of the first 129 months (April 2007 to December 2017) were used for the analysis and construction of the models (training dataset). In addition, the records of the last 24 months (January 2018 to December 2019) were used to evaluate the predictions made (test dataset). Structural change was identified (Chow test), ARIMA models were adjusted, predictions were estimated with and without considering the structural change, and predictions were evaluated using error indices (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and MASE). Results The total percentage of discharges due to death was 3.41%. A structural change was observed in the time series (March 2009, p&gt;0.001), and ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,1,2) 12 with drift models were adjusted with and without consideration of the structural change. The error metrics favored the model that did not consider the structural change (MAE = 0.63, RMSE = 0.81, MAPE = 25.89%, and MASE = 0.65). Conclusion Our study suggests that the ARIMA models are an adequate tool for future monitoring of the monthly percentage of hospital discharges due to death, allowing us to detect observations that depart from the described trend and identify future structural changes."

GATA binding protein 5 (GATA5) is an important member of GATA family and plays an important role in vascular inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress and cell metabolism. Previous studies have shown that the DNA sequence variants (DSVs) in GATA4 and GATA6 promoter can increase susceptibility to AMI. In this study, we explored the relationship between GATA5 promoter and AMI for the first time, hoping to provide a new genetic basis for understanding the pathogenesis of AMI. Methods GATA5 promoter was sequenced in 683 individuals (332 AMI patients and 351 controls). The transcriptional activity of the GATA5 promoter with or without DSVs in HEK-293 cells, H9c2 cells and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were examined by Promega Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to explore whether the DSVs interfered with the binding of transcription factors (TFs). Results Nine mutations have been found in GATA5 promoter, eight of them evidently altered the transcriptional activity of the GATA5 promoter, five of them disrupted the binding of TFs (such as farnesoid X receptor). Furthermore, haplotype AT (across rs80197101 and rs77067995) is a dangerous haplotype of AMI. Genotype GA and allele A of rs80197101 and genotype CT and allele T of rs77067995 are the risk factors of AMI. Conclusions DSVs in GATA5 promoter can increase susceptibility to AMI.

LVDD shares overlapping symptomatology (cough and dyspnea) with COPD. Stress induced LVDD is indicative of masked HFpEF. Our aim was to evaluate the predictive value of inflammatory, oxidative stress, cardio-pulmonary and echocardiographic parameters at rest for the diagnosis of stress LVDD in non-severe COPD patients, who complain of exertional dyspnea and are free of overt cardiovascular diseases. A total of 104 COPD patients (26 patients with mild and 78 with moderate COPD) underwent echocardiography before cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and 1-2 minutes after peak exercise. Patients were divided into two groups based on peak average E/e': patients with stress induced left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD)-E/e' > 15 masked HFpEF and patients without LVDD-without masked HFpEF. CPET and echocardiographic parameters at rest were measured and their predictive value for stress E/e' was analysed. Markers for inflammation (resistin, prostaglandine E2) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostanes) were also determined. Stress induced LVDD occurred in 67/104 patients (64%). Those patients showed higher VE/VCO2 slope. None of the CPET parameters was an independent predictor for stress LVDD.Except for prostglandine E2, none of the inflammatory or oxidative stress markers correlated to stress E/e'. The best independent predictors for stress LVDD (masked HFpEF) were RAVI, right ventricular parasternal diameter and RV E/A >0.75. Their combination predicted stress LVDD with the accuracy of 91.2%. There is a high prevalence of masked HFpEF in non-severe COPD with exertional dyspnea, free of overt cardiovascular disease.

Here, we address how protein phosphatase activity is directed to the correct substrates under the correct conditions.

Protein kinases and phosphatases regulate diverse biological processes by controlling the phosphorylation state of target proteins, requiring that they select specific substrates and act on them at the correct time and place. Protein kinases have conserved allosteric elements that control kinase activity in response to regulatory inputs and have deep active site grooves that facilitate recognition of cognate substrates (1Huse M.

Determining how each family of phosphatases achieves regulation and specificity will reveal mechanistic differences that distinguish each phosphatase family and may suggest specific strategies for targeting phosphatases with small molecules. We focus here on the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family of serine/threonine phosphatases, members of which are found across all kingdoms of life (5Moorhead G.B.G. De Wever V. Templeton G. Kerk D.

Phosphatases from the PP2C family are precisely regulated to control a diverse range of processes including stress response, development, virulence, and cell growth and death in all kingdoms of life, but their mechanisms of regulation and substrate specificity are unknown (4Shi Y.

To address this question, we developed a system to compare substrate selection and regulation of two PP2C phosphatases, SpoIIE and RsbU, which coexist in the same bacterial cell but respond to different signals and act on distinct phosphoprotein substrates. SpoIIE controls the developmental program of spore development in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 1A) (8Stragier P. Losick R. Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 297-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). After asymmetric cell division, SpoIIE is stabilized against proteolysis and is activated by multimerization in small cells (9Bradshaw N. Losick R. Asymmetric division triggers cell-specific gene expression through coupled capture and stabilization of a phosphatase.Elife. 2015; 4e08145Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The multimerization, stabilization, and activation of SpoIIE are mediated by its unique regulatory domain. Upon activation, SpoIIE dephosphorylates SpoIIAA to activate a cell-specific transcription factor (Fig. 1A) (8Stragier P. Losick R. Molecular genetics of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.Annu. Rev.

Activation of cell-specific transcription by a serine phosphatase at the site of asymmetric division.Science. 1995; 270: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We recently found that SpoIIE is activated by rotation of an α-helical element at the base of the phosphatase domain to form the binding site for the catalytically essential metal ions (we refer to the metal ions as “metal cofactor” and use Mn2+ as the metal for all experiments in this study, Fig. 1B and C) (11Bradshaw N.

A widespread family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases shares a common regulatory switch with proteasomal proteases.Elife. 2017; 6e26111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory α-helical element we described is a conserved feature of the PP2C domain, and we hypothesized that it is preserved as a regulatory switch for phosphatases in this family (11Bradshaw N. Levdikov V.M. Zimanyi C.M. Gaudet R. Wilkinson A.J. Losick R. A widespread family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases shares a common regulatory switch with proteasomal proteases.Elife. 2017; 6e26111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphatase RsbU has a PP2C domain that is related to SpoIIE (17% sequence identity and 40% similarity and includes a region predicted to form the α-helical switch) (Fig. S1, A and B) but has an unrelated N-terminal regulatory domain (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A) and responds to different signals to initiate the general stress response in B. subtilis (Fig. 1A) (12Yang X.

Opposing pairs of serine protein kinases and phosphatases transmit signals of environmental stress to activate a bacterial transcription factor.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The general stress response describes a broad transcriptional response that is activated by diverse bacterial species in response to changing conditions and coordinates processes including virulence, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm formation (13Gottesman S. Trouble is coming: Signaling pathways that regulate general stress responses in bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 11685-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A common mechanism for activation of a general stress response relies on a PP2C phosphatase that recognizes the initiating signal. This appears to be the most evolutionarily ancient and broadly conserved function of the PP2C family of phosphatases across the bacterial kingdom. To activate the general stress response under conditions of environmental stress in B. subtilis, RsbU binds to an activating protein (RsbT) and dephosphorylates RsbV. RsbV then activates the transcription factor σB, which controls the general stress response transcriptional program in B. subtilis (Fig. 1A) (12Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W. Opposing pairs of serine protein kinases and phosphatases transmit signals of environmental stress to activate a bacterial transcription factor.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is essential that SpoIIE and RsbU act with high fidelity on their cognate substrates (14Carniol K. Kim T.-J. Price C.W. Losick R. Insulation of the sigmaF regulatory system in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4390-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); aberrant dephosphorylation of RsbV-P and activation of the general stress response during sporulation blocks spore development (15Rothstein D.M.

Bacteriol. 2017; 199e00212-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and dephosphorylation of SpoIIAA-P in nonsporulating cells is toxic. In addition to sensing different signals and acting on different substrates, SpoIIE and RsbU exhibit different response profiles. Whereas SpoIIE initiates a switch-like developmental transition, RsbU initiates a graded response with amplitudes scaled to the strength of the initiating signal (16Cabeen M.T. Russell J.R.

Young J.W. Fontes M. Jimenez M.J.H. Elowitz M.B. Stochastic pulse regulation in bacterial stress response.Science. 2011; 334: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These phosphatase–substrate pairs thus provide an experimentally tractable system within a well-characterized model organism with which to identify principles for how PP2C family of phosphatases are regulated and achieve substrate specificity. Using a combined forward-genetic and biochemical approach to probe the regulation and specificity of RsbU and SpoIIE, we found that the regulatory switch is a conserved element that ensures each phosphatase is only active at the correct time, under the correct conditions, and when in complex with the correct substrate protein. To assess how SpoIIE achieves specificity for its cognate substrate SpoIIAA as opposed to its noncognate substrate RsbV, we used the C-terminal phosphatase domain in isolation (SpoIIE590–827) (Fig. 1C). We selected this construct to test the hypothesis that specificity can be encoded by the PP2C catalytic domain alone and to identify potentially conserved mechanisms of specificity. At least three steps of the phosphatase reaction could in principle contribute to specificity: substrate recognition, chemistry, and metal-cofactor binding. To isolate the contributions of substrate recognition and chemistry, we held the metal-cofactor constant at saturating levels (10 mM MnCl2). Under these conditions, SpoIIE590–827 was specific, dephosphorylating SpoIIAA-P approximately 3500-fold more efficiently than the off-pathway substrate, RsbV-P (SpoIIAA-P kcat/KM = 0.68 ± 0.04 min−1 μM−1, RsbV-P kcat/KM = 0.00020 ± 0.00002 min−1 μM−1) (Fig. 1D). This specificity was principally the result of an increased kcat for the cognate substrate (18.7 ± 0.4 min−1 for SpoIIAA, 0.064 ± 0.005 min−1 for RsbV) but was enhanced by a lower KM for the cognate substrate (20 ± 1 μM for SpoIIAA, 255 ± 39 μM for RsbV) (Fig. 1E). Thus, specificity is achieved by directing 3.4 kcal/mol of the specific binding energy for the cognate substrate to stabilizing the transition state and 1.5 kcal/mol to stabilization of the enzyme substrate complex (Fig. 1F). Here we discuss KM as representing “substrate recognition”, but also note that the lack of a lag phase in presteady state reactions, the μM KM values for substrate, and minute timescale kcat are all suggestive of the KM being equal to the KD of the enzyme–substrate complex. The conserved regulatory switch moves to activate SpoIIE by recruiting a metal cofactor to the active site (Fig. 1C). We hypothesized that substrate binding is favored when the switch is in the active conformation, coupling substrate binding to metal-cofactor binding. To investigate this hypothesis, we took advantage of a gain-of-function mutant of SpoIIE (valine 697 to alanine, V697A) in which substitution of a single amino acid in the hydrophobic core of the phosphatase domain biases the switch to the active state (Fig. 1C) (11Bradshaw N. Levdikov V.M. Zimanyi C.M. Gaudet R. Wilkinson A.J. Losick R.

Novel spoIIE mutation that causes uncompartmentalized sigmaF activation in Bacillus subtilis.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1590-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The V697A substitution decreased the specificity of SpoIIE, increasing the kcat/KM for RsbV-P 150-fold compared with a 5-fold increase for SpoIIAA-P (Fig. 2A). In the experiments described below, we analyzed the effect of the V697A substitution on KM, kcat, and metal-cofactor binding with both the cognate and noncognate substrates. The V697A substitution decreased the KM of SpoIIE590–827 for both SpoIIAA-P (10-fold) and RsbV-P (5-fold) (Fig. 2A), suggesting that substrate binding is favored when SpoIIE is in the active conformation. The V697A substitution increased the maximal catalytic rate (kcat) of SpoIIE590–827 for the noncognate substrate nearly 40-fold while having a modest effect on the cognate substrate (Fig. 2A). Thus, the switch controls the maximum catalytic rate of SpoIIE in addition to controlling metal-cofactor binding. Furthermore, the conformational flexibility of the switch can differentially affect the catalytic rate for cognate and noncognate substrates. To monitor metal-cofactor recruitment, we held the substrate concentration constant and measured SpoIIE activity with varied concentrations of MnCl2 (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our previous observations, the V697A substitution decreased the concentration of MnCl2 required for SpoIIE590–827 to dephosphorylate SpoIIAA-P (K1/2 3.1 ± 0.9 mM for WT SpoIIE590–827 and K1/2 0.16 ± 0.05 mM for SpoIIE590–827 V697A). In contrast, the V697A substitution increases the MnCl2 concentration required for dephosphorylation for the noncognate substrate RsbV-P (K1/2 of 2.0 ± 0.4 mM for WT SpoIIE590–827 and K1/2 of 19 ± 2 mM for SpoIIE590–827 V697A). Cooperativity of metal-cofactor binding (Hill coefficient of two, inset panels Fig. 2B) yields a switch-like response profile, appropriate for initiation of a developmental transition. Together, these kinetic parameters demonstrate that the switch mediates coupling between metal-cofactor binding, substrate recognition, and chemistry and that the V697A substitution shifts binding energy for the noncognate substrate from metal-cofactor binding to chemistry, reducing specificity at saturating metal-cofactor concentrations (summarized in Fig. 2C). PP2C family of phosphatases has regulatory domains that control their activity (4Shi Y. Serine/threonine phosphatases: Mechanism through structure.Cell. 2009; 139: 468-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 11Bradshaw N. Levdikov V.M. Zimanyi C.M. Gaudet R. Wilkinson A.J. Losick R. A widespread family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases shares a common regulatory switch with proteasomal proteases.Elife. 2017; 6e26111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore repeated the above analysis with the phosphatase domain of SpoIIE together with a portion of the regulatory domain (SpoIIE457–827). We chose this fragment because it is a well-behaved soluble protein whose crystal structure we previously reported (11Bradshaw N. Levdikov V.M. Zimanyi C.M. Gaudet R. Wilkinson A.J. Losick R. A widespread family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases shares a common regulatory switch with proteasomal proteases.Elife. 2017; 6e26111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Although the regulatory domain is truncated, this fragment allowed us to test how contact with an accessory domain affects the behavior of the switch. Similar to our observations with SpoIIE590–827, SpoIIE457–827 was specific for SpoIIAA-P (SpoIIAA-P kcat/KM = 0.039 ± 0.002 min−1 μM−1, RsbV-P kcat/KM = 7.2 ± 0.2 × 10−5 min−1 μM−1) (Fig. 3A), and its specificity for its cognate substrate was reduced by the V697A substitution (kcat/KM for RsbV-P increases 100-fold but was unaffected for SpoIIAA-P) (Fig. 3A). SpoIIE457–827 exhibited several notable differences from the phosphatase domain alone (SpoIIE590–827). First, the regulatory domain increased the KM of SpoIIE for both cognate and noncognate substrates, such that the concentration dependence of the phosphatase activity was linear even at concentrations of substrate above 100 μM (Fig. 3A). Second, the regulatory domain altered how the V697A substitution affected metal-cofactor binding; although the substitution decreased the concentration of MnCl2 required for SpoIIE457–827 to dephosphorylate SpoIIAA-P (Fig. 2A), it had no effect on the concentration of MnCl2 required to dephosphorylate RsbV-P (Fig. 3B). Together, these findings (summarized in Fig. 3C) are consistent with coupling between substrate recognition, chemistry, and metal-cofactor recruitment and indicate that regulatory domains can influence all three steps through the switch. Next, we addressed whether coupled activation, substrate recognition, and metal-cofactor binding through the switch is conserved for the stress-response phosphatase, RsbU (Fig. 1A). First, we tested the hypothesis that the switch mediates RsbT activation of RsbU. We took an unbiased approach to interrogate the mechanism of RsbU activation by performing a genetic screen to isolate variants of RsbU that are active in the absence of RsbT. We reasoned that if the switch is important for RsbU regulation, we would isolate activating mutations in the switch region. We generated a library of randomly mutagenized rsbU variants and induced their expression in a strain harboring a LacZ reporter for σB activity and selected for variants that activated σB. From this screen, we identified two amino acid substitutions in the RsbU phosphatase domain, both at M166 (M166L and M166V), which activated σB in the absence of RsbT as visualized by lacZ-dependent color change on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates (Fig. 4A shows plates with rsbUM116L/V introduced at the native locus; Fig. S2A shows the plates with strains expressing rsbUM166L/V using the plasmid-based system used in the screen). Activation of σB was dependent on expression of the mutagenized RsbU because both pathways known to dephosphorylate RsbV-P were deleted from the parental strain (and all other strains described below), and activation in plasmid-based systems depended on induction of RsbU expression (Fig. S2A). M166 is in the N-terminal α-helix of the switch and is predicted to pack in the hydrophobic core of the phosphatase domain (Fig. 4B). The position of these mutations is reminiscent of the activating mutation V697A in SpoIIE (Fig. 4B), and the position of M166 in the RsbU switch provides independent evidence that the switch is required for RsbU activation. Our analysis of the SpoIIE V697A mutation revealed that it acts by biasing the switch toward the active conformation, allowing for partial activation in the absence of signal, and potentiating the response to low levels of signal (11Bradshaw N. Levdikov V.M. Zimanyi C.M. Gaudet R. Wilkinson A.J. Losick R. A widespread family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases shares a common regulatory switch with proteasomal proteases.Elife. 2017; 6e26111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a similar mechanism for the M166 mutations, we observed that when the plasmids used to isolate the rsbUM166L/V variants were introduced to strains with rsbT, σB activity was elevated compared with ΔrsbT strains on plates (Fig. S2A). A similar phenomenon was not qualitatively apparent on plates for cells expressing rsbUM116L/V at the native locus (Fig. 4A). However, we observed that the σB activity of liquid-grown cells expressing rsbUM116L sharply increased between absorbance 0.5 and 1.0 at 600 nm and peaked as the cells entered the stationary phase (absorbance 1.5 at 600 nm) (Fig. 4C, top panel). This cell density–dependent effect was potentiated by RsbT; σB activity was 10-fold lower in strains that lacked rsbT (Fig. 4C, bottom panel). A similar cell density–dependent increase in σB activity was not detected in cells expressing WT rsbU regardless of the presence of rsbT (Fig. 4C, top panel). These data suggest that mutation of M166 sensitizes RsbU to activation by RsbT—even at levels that are normally insufficient to elicit a response. The rsbUM166L mutation also potentiated the RsbT-mediated response to environmental stress. Cells with rsbUM166L integrated at the native chromosomal locus had an elevated response to a well-characterized environmental stressor (4% ethanol by volume) that activates RsbU through RsbT (12Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W. Opposing pairs of serine protein kinases and phosphatases transmit signals of environmental stress to activate a bacterial transcription factor.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Stress was introduced at low cell density (absorbance 0.1–0.2 at 600 nm) to minimize the impact of cell density on σB activity in rsbUM166L-expressing cells. The elevated response of cells expressing rsbUM166L mirrored the characteristic dynamics of the sharp and transient increase in σB activity of WT cells followed by a gradual ramp-down of activities (Fig. 4D and Fig. S2B, top panel). As this response depends on both RsbT and RsbU, strains lacking either of these genes failed to respond to the stressor (Fig. 4D, bottom panel). Together, the position of M166 in the RsbU regulatory switch and its impact on RsbU activity implicate the switch as a conserved element to control phosphatase activity in response to cellular signals. If the switch element acts similarly to activate SpoIIE and RsbU, a simple prediction is that activation of RsbU by RsbT would decrease the concentration of the metal cofactor required for the activity. We reconstituted RsbU activation by RsbT and found that RsbT decreased the K1/2 of RsbU for Mn2+ by nearly 100-fold (K1/2 1.0 ± 0.1 mM in the presence of RsbT and 77 ± 9 mM in the absence of RsbT) (Fig. 5A). In contrast to SpoIIE, RsbU activity toward its cognate substrate was noncooperative with respect to Mn2+ concentration (Fig. 5A, right panels). Although SpoIIE regulates a developmental transition, for which an all-or-nothing response is important, RsbU regulates a stress response, for which the graded response that noncooperative activation affords may be advantageous. In our in vitro assays, RsbT additionally enhanced the maximal catalytic activity of RsbU toward RsbV-P 10-fold (kcat 25 ± 2 min−1 in the presence of RsbT and 0.44 ± 0.06 min−1 in the absence of RsbT) (Fig. 5A), consistent with previous observations (12Yang X. Kang C.M. Brody M.S. Price C.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40927-40937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This suggests that, as we observed for SpoIIE, control of chemistry and metal-cofactor binding are coupled, providing nearly a 1000-fold increase in the activity of RsbU at concentrations of metal ion below the K1/2 (as would be expected in the cytoplasm) (21Scribner H. Eisenstadt E. Silver S. Magnesium transport in Bacillus subtilis W23 during growth and sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 1224-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Eisenstadt E. Fisher S. Der C.L. Silver S. Manganese transport in Bacillus subtilis W23 during growth and sporulation.J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of RsbU activation by RsbT further allowed us to determine how specificity is maintained upon phosphatase activation. Like SpoIIE, RsbU is specific: RsbU had a higher catalytic activity toward its cognate substrate (kcat 0.44 ± 0.06 min−1 for RsbV-P and 0.0012 ± 0.0004 min−1 for SpoIIAA-P) and bound both cognate and noncognate substrates tightly (KM 0.9 μM for SpoIIAA-P and 1.5 μM for RsbV-P; KM values were difficult to determine accurately because of limitations of detection for substrate proteins) (Fig. 5B). As with the cognate substrate, RsbT enhanced RsbU catalytic activity toward SpoIIAA-P (a 300-fold increase to kcat 0.32 ± 0.02 min−1) (Fig. 5B). However, RsbT did not substantially change the affinity of metal-cofactor binding with the noncognate substrate (KM 8 ± 3 mM in the absence of RsbT and 20 ± 6 mM in the presence of RsbT), similar to the V697A mutation of SpoIIE457–827 (Fig. 5A). We did note partial cooperativity for manganese with SpoIIAA as the substrate (Hill coefficient of 1.4 ± 0.1 without RsbT and 1.6 ± 0.3 with RsbT). This mild effect is consistent with our observation that the substrate influences the binding of metal in the active site. RsbT also had little impact on SpoIIAA-P binding (approximate KM 1 μM in the absence of RsbT and 0.3 μM in the presence of RsbT) (Fig. 5B). Thus, specificity is maintained because RsbT activation fails to stimulate metal-cofactor binding for RsbU in the presence of its noncognate substrate (summarized in Fig. 5C). By examining two phosphatases, we found that PP2C regulation and specificity is mediated by a conserved allosteric element that is functionally flexible to respond to varied signals and to discriminate between substrate proteins. This regulatory mechanism is orchestrated by an allosteric switch that integrates activating signals and binding to cognate substrate to control metal-cofactor binding in the active site and catalytic activity. This coupling of regulatory inputs, chemistry, and substrate recognition provides a unified mechanism to control diverse signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3134929842,"This work tries to help overcome the lack of relevant translational screening assays, as a limitation for the identification of novel analgesics for neuropathic pain. Hyperexcitability and neurite shortening are common adverse effects of antiviral and antitumor drugs, leading to neuropathic pain. Now, as seen in the drug screening that we developed here, a high-content microscopy-based assay with immortalized dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons (differentiated F11 cells) allowed to identify drugs able to protect against the iatrogenic neurite shortening induced by the antitumor drug vincristine and the antiviral drug rilpivirine. We observed that vincristine and rilpivirine induced a significant reduction in the neurite length, which was reverted by α-lipoic acid. We had also evidenced protective effects of pregabalin and melatonin, acting through the α 2 δ-2 subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channels and the MT 1 receptor, respectively. Additionally, two hits originated from a previous primary screening aimed to detect inhibitors of hyperexcitability to inflammatory mediators in DRG neurons (nitrendipine and felodipine) also prevented neurite shortening in our model. In summary, in this work we developed a novel secondary assay for identifying hits with neuroprotective effect against iatrogenic neurite shortening, consistent with the anti-hyperexcitability action previously tested: highlighting nitrendipine and felodipine against iatrogenic damage in DRG neurons."

We identified 1865 differentially expressed genes that correlated negatively with the methylation profiles of normal lung tissues, never-smoker LUAD tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, while 1079 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using the same criteria. These transcripts were integrated using ingenuity pathway analysis to determine significant pathways directly related to cancer, suggesting that lncRNAs play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. When comparing normal lung tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, 86 candidate genes were identified, including six lncRNAs. Of the 43 candidate genes revealed by comparing never-smoker LUAD tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, 13 were also different when compared to normal lung tissues. We then investigated the expression of these genes using the Gene Expression of Normal and Tumor Tissues (GENT) and Methylation and Expression Database of Normal and Tumor Tissues (MENT) databases. We observed an inverse correlation between the expression of 13 genes in normal lung tissues and smoker LUAD tissues, and the expression of five genes between the never-smoker and smoker LUAD tissues. These findings were further validated in clinical specimens using bisulfite sequencing, revealing that AGR2 , AURKB , FOXP3 , and HMGA1 displayed borderline differences in methylation. Finally, we explored the functional connections between DNA methylation, lncRNAs, and gene expression to identify possible targets that may contribute toward the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-associated LUAD. Together, our findings suggested that differentially expressed lncRNAs and their target transcripts could serve as potential biomarkers for LUAD."
https://openalex.org/W3133990671,"Enhancers regulate gene expressions in a tissue- and pathology-specific manner by altering its activities. Plasma levels of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides, encoded by the Nppa and Nppb, respectively, and synthesized predominantly in cardiomyocytes, vary depending on the severity of heart failure. We previously identified the noncoding conserved region 9 (CR9) element as a putative Nppb enhancer at 22-kb upstream from the Nppb gene. However, its regulatory mechanism remains unknown. Here, we therefore investigated the mechanism of CR9 activation in cardiomyocytes using different kinds of drugs that induce either cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac failure accompanied by natriuretic peptides upregulation. Chronic treatment of mice with either catecholamines or doxorubicin increased CR9 activity during the progression of cardiac hypertrophy to failure, which is accompanied by proportional increases in Nppb expression. Conversely, for cultured cardiomyocytes, doxorubicin decreased CR9 activity and Nppb expression, while catecholamines increased both. However, exposing cultured cardiomyocytes to mechanical loads, such as mechanical stretch or hydrostatic pressure, upregulate CR9 activity and Nppb expression even in the presence of doxorubicin. Furthermore, the enhancement of CR9 activity and Nppa and Nppb expressions by either catecholamines or mechanical loads can be blunted by suppressing mechanosensing and mechanotransduction pathways, such as muscle LIM protein (MLP) or myosin tension. Finally, the CR9 element showed a more robust and cell-specific response to mechanical loads than the −520-bp BNP promoter. We concluded that the CR9 element is a novel enhancer that responds to mechanical loads by upregulating natriuretic peptides expression in cardiomyocytes."

Materials and methods Nineteen health facilities with highest HIV positivity rates among pregnant women across 9 districts in southwest and central Uganda were assigned to control and intervention groups. HIV-positive women enrolled at intervention facilities received pouches filled with premeasured single doses of nevirapine using Uganda national guidelines, which were integrated into the existing drug distribution system. During antenatal care (ANC) women received 14 pouches to cover time until the 6 day postpartum visit, with an additional 8 pouches if women were delayed in returning to the facility, and 28 pouches after delivery. Women enrolled at control facilities received standard nevirapine syrup following delivery for postnatal infant prophylaxis. In a select number of intervention facilities, during ANC, women received all 42 pouches needed to complete the 6 weeks regimen. Medical record data from enrolled women were extracted; interviews with HIV-positive women during postnatal care visits were conducted. Data were collected January to August 2018 (control sites) and October 2019 to February 2020 (intervention sites). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with facility delivery, postnatal care follow-up visit, and completion of the full 6 weeks infant nevirapine regimen. Results Significantly more women in the intervention (n = 320) versus control (n = 340) group had facility delivery (292/316, 92.4% versus 169/340, 49.7%, p&lt;0.0001), postnatal visits within 2 weeks postpartum (295/297, 99.3% versus 133/340, 39.1%, p&lt;0.0001) and reported their infants completing the full 6 weeks infant prophylaxis regimen (299/313, 95.5% versus 210/242, 86.8%, p = 0.0002). Dispensing 42 versus 14 pouches during ANC did not have negative effects on these outcomes. Among out-of-facility deliveries, a higher proportion of infants received nevirapine within 72 hours of birth in the intervention versus control group, 95.8% versus 77.9%. In multivariate models, the intervention group was the only significant factor associated with facility delivery or completion of the full 6 weeks infant prophylaxis. Conclusions Use of the Pratt pouch resulted in an increase in HIV-exposed infants completing the full 6weeks prophylaxis regimen and associated benefits including increasing facility delivery and women’s adherence to postnatal care services."
